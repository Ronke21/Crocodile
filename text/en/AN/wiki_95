<text>Xenix is a discontinued Unix operating system for various microcomputer platforms, licensed by Microsoft from AT&amp;T Corporation. The first version was released in 1980, and Xenix would eventually become the most common Unix variant, measured according to the number of machines on which it was installed, in the mid-to-late 1980s. The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) later acquired exclusive rights to the software, and eventually replaced it with SCO UNIX, later known as OpenServer, with the final Xenix version released in 1991.

==History==
Bell Labs, the developer of Unix, was part of the regulated Bell System and could not sell Unix directly to most end users (academic and research institutions excepted); it could, however, sell it to software vendors who would then resell it to end users (or their own resellers), combined with their own added features. Microsoft, which expected that Unix would be its operating system of the future when personal computers became powerful enough, purchased a license for Version 7 Unix from AT&amp;T in 1978, and announced on August 25, 1980, that it would make the software available for the 16-bit microcomputer market. Because Microsoft was not able to license the &quot;Unix&quot; name itself, the company gave it an original name.

Microsoft called Xenix &quot;a universal operating environment&quot;. It did not sell Xenix directly to end users, but licensed the software to OEMs. Microsoft received $500 for each single-user copy sold by companies such as IBM, Intel, Management Systems Development, Tandy, Altos Computer, SCO, and Siemens (SINIX) which then ported it to their own proprietary computer architectures.
In 1981, Microsoft said the first version of Xenix was &quot;very close to the original Unix version 7 source&quot; on the PDP-11, and later versions were to incorporate its own fixes and improvements. The company stated that it intended to port the operating system to the Zilog Z8000 series, Digital LSI-11, Intel 8086 and 80286, Motorola 68000, and possibly &quot;numerous other processors&quot;, and provide Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;full line of system software products&quot;, including BASIC and other languages. The first port was for the Z8001 16-bit processor: the first customer ship was January 1981 for Central Data Corporation of Illinois, followed in March 1981 by Paradyne Corporation&#x27;s Z8001 product.
The first 8086 port was for the Altos Computer Systems&#x27; non-PC-compatible 8600-series computers (first customer ship date Q1 1982).

Intel sold complete computers with Xenix under their Intel System 86 brand (with specific models such as 86/330 or 86/380X); they also offered the individual boards that made these computers under their iSBC brand. This included processor boards like iSBC 86/12 and also MMU boards such as the iSBC 309. The first Intel Xenix systems shipped in July 1982. Tandy more than doubled the Xenix installed base when it made TRS-Xenix the default operating system for its TRS-80 Model 16 68000-based computer in early 1983, and was the largest Unix vendor in 1984. Seattle Computer Products also made (PC-incompatible) 8086 computers bundled with Xenix, like their Gazelle II, which used the S-100 bus and was available in late 1983 or early 1984. There was also a port for IBM System 9000.

SCO had initially worked on its own PDP-11 port of V7, called Dynix, but then struck an agreement with Microsoft for joint development and technology exchange on Xenix in 1982. Microsoft and SCO then further engaged Human Computing Resources Corporation (HCR) in Canada, and a software products group within Logica plc in the United Kingdom, as part of making further improvements to Xenix and porting Xenix to other platforms. In doing so, Microsoft gave HCR and Logica the rights to do Xenix ports and to license Xenix binary distributions in those territories.

In 1984, a port to the 68000-based Apple Lisa 2 was jointly developed by SCO and Microsoft and it was the first shrink-wrapped binary product sold by SCO. The Multiplan spreadsheet was released for it.

In its 1983 OEM directory, Microsoft said the difficulty in porting to the various 8086 and Z8000-based machines had been the lack of a standardized memory management unit and protection facilities. Hardware manufacturers compensated by designing their own hardware, but the ensuing complexity made it &quot;extremely difficult if not impossible for the very small manufacturer to develop a computer capable of supporting a system such as Xenix from scratch,&quot; and &quot;the Xenix kernel must be custom-tailored to each new hardware environment.&quot;

A generally available port to the unmapped Intel 8086/8088 architecture was done by The Santa Cruz Operation around 1983. SCO Xenix for the PC XT shipped sometime in 1984 and contained some enhancement from 4.2BSD; it also supported the Micnet local area networking.

The later 286 version of Xenix used the integrated MMU present on this chip, by running in 286 protected mode. The 286 Xenix was accompanied by new hardware from Xenix OEMs. For example, the Sperry PC/IT, an IBM PC AT clone, was advertised as capable of supporting eight simultaneous dumb terminal users under this version.

While Xenix 2.0 was still based on Version 7 Unix, version 3.0 was upgraded to a Unix System III code base, a 1984 Intel manual for Xenix 286 noted that the Xenix kernel had about 10,000 lines at this time. It was followed by a System V R2 codebase in Xenix 5.0 (a.k.a. Xenix System V).

&quot;Microsoft hopes that Xenix will become the preferred choice for software production and exchange&quot;, the company stated in 1981. Microsoft referred to its own MS-DOS as its &quot;single-user, single-tasking operating system&quot;, and advised customers who wanted multiuser or multitasking support to buy Xenix. It planned over time to improve MS-DOS so it would be almost indistinguishable from single-user Xenix, or XEDOS, which would also run on the 68000, Z8000, and LSI-11; they would be upwardly compatible with Xenix, which &quot;Byte&quot; in 1983 described as &quot;the multi-user MS-DOS of the future&quot;. Microsoft&#x27;s Chris Larson described MS-DOS 2.0&#x27;s Xenix compatibility as &quot;the second most important feature&quot;. His company advertised DOS and Xenix together, describing MS-DOS 2.0 (its &quot;single-user OS&quot;) as sharing features and system calls with Xenix (&quot;the multi-user, multi-tasking, Unix-derived operating system&quot;), and promising easy porting between them.

=== Transfer of ownership to SCO ===
After the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, AT&amp;T started selling System V. Microsoft, believing that it could not compete with Unix&#x27;s developer, decided to abandon Xenix. The decision was not immediately transparent, which led to the term vaporware. It agreed with IBM to develop OS/2, and the Xenix team (together with the best MS-DOS developers) was assigned to that project. In 1987, Microsoft transferred ownership of Xenix to SCO in an agreement that left Microsoft owning slightly less than 20% of SCO (this amount prevented both companies from having to disclose the exact amount in the event of an SCO IPO). SCO would acquire both of the other companies that had Xenix rights, Logica&#x27;s software products group in 1986 and HCR in 1990. When Microsoft eventually lost interest in OS/2 as well, the company based its further high-end strategy on Windows NT.

In 1987, SCO ported Xenix to the 386 processor, a 32-bit chip, after securing knowledge from Microsoft insiders that Microsoft was no longer developing Xenix. Xenix System V Release 2.3.1 introduced support for i386, SCSI and TCP/IP. SCO&#x27;s Xenix System V/386 was the first 32-bit operating system available on the market for the x86 CPU architecture.

Microsoft continued to use Xenix internally, submitting a patch to support functionality in Unix to AT&amp;T in 1987, which trickled down to the code base of both Xenix and SCO Unix. Microsoft is said to have used Xenix on Sun workstations and VAX minicomputers extensively within their company as late as 1988. All internal Microsoft email transport was done on Xenix-based 68000 systems until 1995–1996, when the company moved to its own Exchange Server product. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said at Unix Expo in 1996 that, for a long time, Microsoft had the highest-volume AT&amp;T Unix license.

=== Replacement ===
SCO released its SCO Unix as a higher-end product, based on System V R3 and offering a number of technical advances over Xenix; Xenix remained in the product line. In the meantime, AT&amp;T and Sun Microsystems completed the merge of Xenix, BSD, SunOS and System V R3 into System V R4. The last version of SCO Xenix/386 itself was System V R2.3.4, released in 1991.

==Features==
Aside from its AT&amp;T Unix base, Xenix incorporated elements from BSD, notably the vi text editor and its supporting libraries (termcap and curses). Its kernel featured some original extensions by Microsoft, notably file locking and semaphores, while to the userland Microsoft added a &quot;visual shell&quot; for menu-driven operation instead of the traditional UNIX shell. A limited form of local networking over serial lines (RS-232 ports) was possible through the &quot;micnet&quot; software, which supported file transfer and electronic mail, although UUCP was still used for networking via modems.

OEMs often added further modifications to the Xenix system.

==Trusted Xenix==
Trusted Xenix was a variant initially developed by IBM, under the name Secure XENIX; later versions, under the Trusted Xenix name, were developed by Trusted Information Systems. It incorporated the Bell–LaPadula model of multilevel security, and had a multilevel secure interface for the STU-III secure communications device (that is, an STU-III connection would be made available only to those applications running at the same privilege level as the key loaded in the STU-III). It was evaluated by formal methods and achieved a B2 security rating under the DoD&#x27;s Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (examples of A1-class systems are Honeywell&#x27;s SCOMP, Aesec&#x27;s GEMSOS, and Boeing&#x27;s SNS Server). Version 2.0 was released in January 1991, version 3.0 in April 1992, and version 4.0 in September 1993. It was still in use as late as 1995.

<text>In Greek mythology, Lichas ( ; ) was Heracles&#x27; servant, who brought the poisoned shirt from Deianira to Hercules because of Deianira&#x27;s jealousy of Iole, which killed him.

== Mythology ==
Lichas brought to his master the deadly garment, and as a punishment, was thrown by him into the sea, where the Lichadian islands, between Euboea and the coast of Locris, were believed to have derived their name from him. The story is recounted in Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Women of Trachis&quot; and Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

=== Ovid&#x27;s account ===

Cape Lichada is said to be where Hercules flung Lichas into the sea:

So, in his frenzy, as he wandered there,&lt;br&gt;he chanced upon the trembling Lichas, crouched&lt;br&gt;in the close covert of a hollow rock.&lt;br&gt;Then in a savage fury he cried out,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Was it you, Lichas, brought this fatal gift?&lt;br&gt;Shall you be called the author of my death?&quot;&lt;br&gt;Lichas, in terror, groveled at his feet,&lt;br&gt;and begged for mercy&quot;Only let me live!&quot;&lt;br&gt;But seizing on him, the crazed Hero whirled&lt;br&gt;him thrice and once again about his head,&lt;br&gt;and hurled him, shot as by a catapult,&lt;br&gt;into the waves of the Euboic Sea.&lt;br&gt;Lichas was innocent but due to a big misunderstanding&lt;br&gt;Hercules threw in him the sea.While he was hanging in the air, his form&lt;br&gt;was hardened; as, we know, rain drops may first&lt;br&gt;be frozen by the cold air, and then change&lt;br&gt;to snow, and as it falls through whirling winds&lt;br&gt;may press, so twisted, into round hailstones:&lt;br&gt;even so has ancient lore declared that when&lt;br&gt;strong arms hurled Lichas through the mountain air&lt;br&gt;through fear, his blood was curdled in his veins.&lt;br&gt;No moisture left in him, he was transformed&lt;br&gt;into a flint-rock. Even to this day,&lt;br&gt;a low crag rising from the waves is seen&lt;br&gt;out of the deep Euboean Sea, and holds&lt;br&gt;the certain outline of a human form,&lt;br&gt;so surely traced, the wary sailors fear&lt;br&gt;to tread upon it, thinking it has life,&lt;br&gt;and they have called it Lichas ever since. —Ovid. &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, IX:211

<text>In Greek mythology, Licymnius (; ) was a good friend of Heracles and an illegitimate son of Electryon, King of Tiryns and Mycenae in the Argolid (which makes him half-brother of Alcmene, mother of Heracles). His mother is given as Mideia, a Phrygian woman. One source mentions Alco (Ἀλκώ) as his sister. Licymnios appears in the Iliad (II, 661-663) as an old uncle of Heracles (without other details than that of being a &quot;spawn of Ares - which can be understood figuratively as &quot;warrior&quot;)

== Mythology ==
Licymnius was the only one of Electryon&#x27;s sons to return home after the unsuccessful war against the Taphians and Teleboans. Licymnius married Perimede, daughter of Alcaeus and sister of Amphitryon, and became the father of Melas, Argius and Oeonus. Licymnius accompanied Amphitryon when the latter was expelled from the Argolid and fled to Thebes. 

According to one story, found in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, he was accidentally killed in his old age by Heracles&#x27; son Tlepolemus, when the latter was beating his servant with a stick and Licymnius ran in between (or else Tlepolemus and Licymnius had a quarrel over a certain matter). Pausanias mentions his tomb in Argos.

<doc id="84431" wikidata="Q2446665" url="?curid=84431" title="Lityerses">
<text>In Greek mythology, Lityerses (Ancient Greek: Λιτυέρσης) was an illegitimate son of Midas (or of Comis) dwelling in Celaenae, Phrygia.

== Mythology ==
Lityerses was a talented swordsman, and was bloodthirsty and aggressive. He challenged people to harvesting contests and beheaded those he beat, putting the rest of their bodies in the sheaves. Heracles won the contest and killed him, then threw his body into the river Maeander. He was also known as the &quot;Reaper of Men.&quot; One source describes him as a glutton who could eat &quot;three asses&#x27; panniers&quot; of food and drink &quot;a ten-amphora cask&quot; of wine at a time.

The Phrygian reapers used to celebrate his memory in a harvest-song which bore the name of Lityerses. The Phrygians&#x27; song for Lityerses was, according to one tradition, a comic version of the Mariandyni&#x27;s lament sung for Bormus.

Theocritus in his tenth Idyll gives a specimen of a Greek harvest-song addressed to Demeter, called &#x27;the Song of the Divine Lityerses&#x27;. In this song, there is no mention of the legend; it is merely an ordinary reaping-song.

==In Written Stories==
* In &quot;The Lost Hero&quot;, a resurrected Lityerses meets Jason Grace, Piper McLean and Leo Valdez and tries to kill them. However they escape and Lityerses is turned to gold due to a mistake of his father, King Midas. Jason throws a rug on the statue to keep him from being freed.
* In &quot;The Dark Prophecy&quot;, Lityerses is shown to be working under Commodus who is a part of the evil god emperors, Triumvirate Holdings, having been freed by Commodus. However, after Apollo saves him from execution by the hands of Commodus, he helps Apollo throughout the book and chooses to live at the Waystation.
*In &quot;The Tower of Nero&quot;, Lit is mentioned to have settled in well and to be running an elephant visitation program at the Waystation.

In 2006 a $1.1 million trail renovation was finished which provided new viewing platforms and a redesigned trail. Swimming was at one time allowed along the entire length of the falls, but due to a number of serious accidents, and large-scale damage to the natural environment, all of the area along the water above the bottom level is now closed by state law.

<text>Allan David Bloom (September 14, 1930 – October 7, 1992) was an American philosopher, classicist, and academician. He studied under David Grene, Leo Strauss, Richard McKeon, and Alexandre Kojève. He subsequently taught at Cornell University, the University of Toronto, Tel Aviv University, Yale University, the École normale supérieure, and the University of Chicago.

Bloom championed the idea of Great Books education and became famous for his criticism of contemporary American higher education, with his views being expressed in his bestselling 1987 book, &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot;. Characterized as a conservative in the popular media, Bloom denied the label, asserting that what he sought to defend was the &quot;theoretical life&quot;. Saul Bellow wrote &quot;Ravelstein&quot;, a &quot;roman à clef&quot; based on Bloom, his friend and colleague at the University of Chicago.

==Early life and education==
Bloom was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, to second-generation Jewish parents who were both social workers. The couple had a daughter, Lucille, two years earlier. As a thirteen-year-old, Bloom read a &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; article about the University of Chicago and told his parents he wanted to attend; his parents thought it was unreasonable and did not encourage his hopes. Yet, when his family moved to Chicago in 1944, his parents met a psychiatrist and family friend whose son was enrolled in the University of Chicago&#x27;s humanities program for gifted students. In 1946, Bloom was accepted to the same program, starting his degree at the age of fifteen, and spending the next decade of his life enrolled at the university in Chicago&#x27;s Hyde Park neighborhood. This began his lifelong passion for the &#x27;idea&#x27; of the university.

In the preface to &quot;Giants and Dwarfs: Essays, 1960–1990&quot;, he stated that his education &quot;began with Freud and ended with Plato&quot;. The theme of this education was self-knowledge, or self-discovery—an idea that Bloom would later write, seemed impossible to conceive of for a Midwestern American boy. He credits Leo Strauss as the teacher who made this endeavor possible for him.

Bloom graduated from the University of Chicago with a bachelor&#x27;s degree at the age of 18. One of his college classmates was the classicist Seth Benardete. For post-graduate studies, he enrolled in the University of Chicago&#x27;s Committee on Social Thought, where he was assigned classicist David Grene as tutor. Bloom went on to write his thesis on Isocrates. Grene recalled Bloom as an energetic and humorous student completely dedicated to studying classics, but with no definite career ambitions. The committee was a unique interdisciplinary program that attracted a small number of students due to its rigorous academic requirements and lack of clear employment opportunities after graduation. Bloom earned his Ph.D. from the Committee on Social Thought in 1955. He subsequently studied under the influential Hegelian philosopher Alexandre Kojève in Paris, whose lectures Bloom would later introduce to the English-speaking world. While teaching philosophy at the in Paris, he befriended Raymond Aron, amongst many other philosophers. Among the American expatriate community in Paris, his friends included writer Susan Sontag.

==Career and death==
Bloom studied and taught in Paris (1953–55) at the École normale supérieure, and Germany (1957). Upon returning to the United States in 1955, he taught adult education students at the University of Chicago with his friend Werner J. Dannhauser, author of &quot;Nietzsche&#x27;s View of Socrates&quot;. Bloom went on to teach at Yale from 1960 to 1963, at Cornell until 1970, and at the University of Toronto until 1979, when he returned to the University of Chicago. Among Bloom&#x27;s former students are prominent journalists, government officials and political scientists such as Francis Fukuyama, Robert Kraynak, Pierre Hassner, Clifford Orwin, Janet Ajzenstat, John Ibbitson, James Ceaser, and Thomas Pangle.

In 1963, as a professor at Cornell, Allan Bloom served as a faculty member of the Cornell Branch of the Telluride Association, an organization focused on intellectual development and self-governance. The students received free room and board in the Telluride House on the Cornell University campus and assumed the management of the house themselves. While living at the house, Bloom befriended former U.S. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. Bloom&#x27;s first book was a collection of three essays on Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Politics&quot;; it included an essay from Harry V. Jaffa. He translated and commented upon Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Letter to M. d&#x27;Alembert on the Theater&quot;, bringing it into dialogue with Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. In 1968, he published his most significant work of philosophical translation and interpretation, a translation of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. Bloom strove to achieve &quot;translation ... for the serious student&quot;. The preface opens on page xi with the statement, &quot;this is intended to be a literal translation.&quot; Although the translation is not universally accepted, Bloom said he always conceptualized the translator&#x27;s role as a matchmaker between readers and the texts he translated. He repeated this effort as a professor of political science at the University of Toronto in 1978, translating Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Among other publications during his years of teaching was a reading of Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, titled &quot;Giants and Dwarfs&quot;; it became the title for a collection of essays on, among others, Raymond Aron, Alexandre Kojève, Leo Strauss, and liberal philosopher John Rawls. Bloom was an editor for the scholarly journal &quot;Political Theory&quot; as well as a contributor to &quot;History of Political Philosophy&quot; (edited by Joseph Cropsey and Leo Strauss).

After returning to Chicago, he befriended and taught courses with Saul Bellow. In 1987 Bellow wrote the preface to &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot;.

Bloom&#x27;s last book, which he dictated while in the hospital dying, and which was published posthumously, was &quot;Love and Friendship&quot;, an offering of interpretations on the meaning of love. There is an ongoing controversy over Bloom&#x27;s semi-closeted homosexuality, possibly culminating, as in Saul Bellow&#x27;s thinly fictionalized account in &quot;Ravelstein&quot;, in his death in 1992 from AIDS. Bloom&#x27;s friends do not deny his homosexuality, but whether he actually died of AIDS remains disputed.

==Philosophy==
Bloom attempted to preserve a philosophical way of life for future generations through both scholarly and popular writing. His writings may be placed into two categories: scholarly (e.g., &quot;Plato&#x27;s Republic&quot;) and popular political commentary (e.g., &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot;).

===&quot;The Republic of Plato&quot;===
Bloom&#x27;s translation and essay on the &quot;Republic&quot; is radically different in many important aspects from the previous translations and interpretations of the &quot;Republic&quot;. Most notable is Bloom&#x27;s discussion of Socratic irony. In fact, irony is the key to Bloom&#x27;s understanding of the &quot;Republic&quot; (see his discussion of Books II–VI of the &quot;Republic&quot;.) Allan Bloom says a philosopher is immune to irony because he can see the tragic as comic and comic as tragic. Bloom refers to Socrates, the philosopher &quot;par excellence,&quot; in his Interpretative Essay stating, &quot;Socrates can go naked where others go clothed; he is not afraid of ridicule. He can also contemplate sexual intercourse where others are stricken with terror; he is not afraid of moral indignation. In other words he treats the comic seriously and the tragic lightly&quot;. Thus irony in the &quot;Republic&quot; refers to the &quot;Just City in Speech&quot;, which Bloom looks at not as a model for future society, nor as a template for the human soul; rather, it is a city presented ironically, an example of the distance between philosophy and every potential philosopher. Bloom follows Strauss in suggesting that the &quot;Just City in Speech&quot; is not natural; it is man-made.

====Critical reception====
Some reviewers, such as Norman Gulley, criticized the quality of both the translation and the essay itself.

==&quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot;==
&quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; was published in 1987, five years after Bloom published an essay in &quot;National Review&quot; about the failure of universities to serve the needs of students. With the encouragement of Saul Bellow, his colleague at the University of Chicago, he expanded his thoughts into a book &quot;about a life I&#x27;ve led&quot;, that critically reflected on the current state of higher education in American universities. His friends and admirers imagined the work would be a modest success, as did Bloom, who recognized his publisher&#x27;s modest advance to complete the project as a lack of sales confidence. Yet on the momentum of strong initial reviews, including one by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and an op-ed piece by syndicated conservative commentator George Will titled, &quot;A How-To Book for the Independent&quot;, it became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback and remaining at number one on &quot;The New York Times Bestseller List&quot; for nonfiction for four months.

The book is a critique of the contemporary university and how Bloom sees it as failing its students. In it, Bloom criticizes the modern movements in philosophy and the humanities. Philosophy professors involved in ordinary language analysis or logical positivism disregard important &quot;humanizing&quot; ethical and political issues and fail to pique the interest of students. Literature professors involved in deconstructionism promote irrationalism and skepticism of standards of truth and thereby dissolve the moral imperatives which are communicated through genuine philosophy and which elevate and broaden the intellects of those who engage with them. To a great extent, Bloom&#x27;s criticism revolves around his belief that the &quot;great books&quot; of Western thought have been devalued as a source of wisdom. Bloom&#x27;s critique extends beyond the university to speak to the general crisis in American society. &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; draws analogies between the United States and the Weimar Republic. The modern liberal philosophy, he says, enshrined in the Enlightenment thought of John Locke—that a just society could be based upon self-interest alone, coupled by the emergence of relativism in American thought—had led to this crisis.

For Bloom, this created a void in the souls of Americans, into which demagogic radicals as exemplified by 1960s student leaders could leap. (In the same fashion, Bloom suggests, the Nazi brownshirts once filled the gap created in German society by the Weimar Republic.) In the second instance, he argued, the higher calling of philosophy and reason understood as freedom of thought, had been eclipsed by a pseudo-philosophy, or an ideology of thought. Relativism was one feature of modern liberal philosophy that had subverted the Platonic–Socratic teaching.

Bloom&#x27;s critique of contemporary social movements at play in universities or society at large is derived from his classical and philosophical orientation. For Bloom, the failure of contemporary liberal education leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern students, and to their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory.

In one chapter, in a style of analysis which resembles the work of the Frankfurt School, he examined the philosophical effects of popular music on the lives of students, placing pop music, or as it is generically branded by record companies &quot;rock music&quot;, in a historical context from Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; to Nietzsche&#x27;s Dionysian longings. Treating it for the first time with genuine philosophical interest, he gave fresh attention to the industry, its target-marketing to children and teenagers, its top performers, its place in the late-capitalist bourgeois economy, and its pretensions to liberation and freedom. Some critics, including the popular musician Frank Zappa, argued that Bloom&#x27;s view of pop music was based on the same ideas that critics of pop &quot;in 1950s held, ideas about the preservation of &#x27;traditional&#x27; white American society&quot;.

Bloom, informed by Socrates, Aristotle, Rousseau, and Nietzsche, explores music&#x27;s power over the human soul. He cites the soldier who throws himself into battle at the urging of the drum corps, the pious believer who prays under the spell of a religious hymn, the lover seduced by the romantic guitar, and points towards the tradition of philosophy that treated musical education as paramount. He names the pop-star Mick Jagger as a cardinal representative of the hypocrisy and erotic sterility of pop-rock music. Pop music employs sexual images and language to enthrall the young and to persuade them that their petty rebelliousness is authentic politics, when, in fact, they are being controlled by the money-managers whom successful performers like Jagger quietly serve. Bloom claims that Jagger is a hero to many university students who envy his fame and wealth but are really just bored by the lack of options before them.

Along with the absence of literature in the lives of the young and their sexual but often unerotic relationships, the first part of &quot;The Closing&quot; tries to explain the current state of education in a fashion beyond the purview of an economist or psychiatrist—contemporary culture&#x27;s leading umpires.

===Critical reception===
The book met with early critical acclaim including positive reviews in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. A second round of reviews was generally more critical.

Martha Nussbaum, a political philosopher and classicist, and Harry V. Jaffa, a conservative, argued that Bloom was deeply influenced by 19th-century European philosophers, especially Friedrich Nietzsche. Nussbaum wrote that, for Bloom, Nietzsche had been disastrously influential in modern American thought.

In a passage of her review, Nussbaum wrote: &quot;How good a philosopher, then, is Allan Bloom? The answer is, we cannot say, and we are given no reason to think him one at all.&quot; The criticism of the book was continued by impassioned reviews of political theorist Benjamin Barber in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;; Alexander Nehamas, a scholar of ancient philosophy and Nietzsche, in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;; and David Rieff in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. David Rieff called Bloom &quot;an academic version of Oliver North: vengeful, reactionary, antidemocratic&quot;. The book, he said, was one that &quot;decent people would be ashamed of having written.&quot; The tone of these reviews led James Atlas in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; to conclude that &quot;the responses to Bloom&#x27;s book have been charged with a hostility that transcends the usual mean-spiritedness of reviewers.&quot; One reviewer, the philosopher Robert Paul Wolff writing in the scholarly journal &quot;Academe&quot;, satirically reviewed the book as a work of fiction: he claimed that Bloom&#x27;s friend Saul Bellow, who had written the introduction, had written a &quot;coruscatingly funny novel in the form of a pettish, bookish, grumpy, reactionary complaint against the last two decades&quot;, with the &quot;author&quot; a &quot;mid-fiftyish professor at the University of Chicago, to whom Bellow gives the evocative name &#x27;Bloom.&#x27;&quot; Yet some reviewers tempered that criticism with an admission of the merits of Bloom&#x27;s writing: for example, Fred Matthews, an historian from York University, began an otherwise relatively critical review in the &quot;American Historical Review&quot; with the statement that Bloom&#x27;s &quot;probes into popular culture&quot; were &quot;both amusing and perceptive&quot; and that the work was &quot;a rich, often brilliant, and disturbing book&quot;.

Some critics embraced Bloom&#x27;s argument. Norman Podhoretz noted that the closed-mindedness in the title refers to the paradoxical consequence of the academic &quot;open mind&quot; found in liberal political thought—namely &quot;the narrow and intolerant dogmatism&quot; that dismisses any attempt, by Plato or the Hebrew Bible for example, to provide a rational basis for moral judgments. Podhoretz continued, &quot;Bloom goes on to charge liberalism with vulgarizing the noble ideals of freedom and equality, and he offers brilliantly acerbic descriptions of the sexual revolution and the feminist movement, which he sees as products of this process of vulgarization.&quot;

In a 1989 article, Ann Clark Fehn discusses the critical reception of the book, noting that it had eclipsed other titles that year dealing with higher education—Ernest Boyer&#x27;s &quot;College&quot; and E. D. Hirsch&#x27;s &quot;Cultural Literacy&quot;—and quoting &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; which had described Bloom&#x27;s book as a &quot;best-seller made by reviews.&quot;

Camille Paglia, a decade after the book&#x27;s release, called it &quot;the first shot in the culture wars&quot;. An early &quot;New York Times&quot; review by Roger Kimball called the book &quot;an unparalleled reflection on the whole question of what it means to be a student in today&#x27;s intellectual and moral climate.&quot;

In an article on Bloom for &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 2000, conservative commentator Andrew Sullivan wrote that &quot;reading [Bloom] ... one feels he has not merely understood Nietzsche; he has imbibed him. But this awareness of the abyss moved Bloom, unlike Nietzsche, toward love and political conservatism. Love, whether for the truth or for another, because it can raise us out of the abyss. Political conservatism because it best restrains the chaos that modernity threatens&quot;. More recently, Bloom&#x27;s book also received a more positive re-assessment from Jim Sleeper in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Keith Botsford would later argue:

==&quot;Love and Friendship&quot;==
Bloom&#x27;s last book, which he dictated while partially paralyzed and in the hospital, and which was published posthumously, was &quot;Love and Friendship&quot;. The book offered interpretations on the meaning of love, through a reading of novels by Stendhal, Jane Austen, Flaubert; Tolstoy in light of Rousseau&#x27;s influence on the Romantic movement; plays by William Shakespeare; Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;; and Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;.

Describing its creation, Bellow wrote:

Of the work, Andrew Sullivan wrote that &quot;you cannot read [Bloom] on &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; or &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; without seeing those works in a new light. You cannot read his account of Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;La nouvelle Heloise&quot; without wanting to go back and read it—more closely—again ... Bloom had a gift for reading reality—the impulse to put your loving face to it and press your hands against it&quot;. Recollecting his friend in an interview, Bellow said &quot;Allan inhaled books and ideas the way the rest of us breathe air ... People only want the factual truth. Well, the truth is that Allan was a very superior person, great-souled. When critics proclaim the death of the novel, I sometimes think they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about. [But] Allan was certainly one.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bloom was gay. His last book, &quot;Love and Friendship&quot;, was dedicated to his companion, Michael Z. Wu. Whether or not he died of AIDS is a subject of controversy.

<text>In Greek mythology, Hyrieus (; ) was the eponym of Hyria in Boeotia, where he dwelt and where Orion (see below) was born; some sources though place him either in Thrace or on Chios. Most accounts speak of him as a king, although Ovid and Nonnus portray him as a peasant.

== Family ==
Hyrieus was the son of Alcyone and Poseidon, brother of Hyperenor and Aethusa. By the nymph Clonia, he became the father of Nycteus and Lycus. According to later sources, Hyrieus was also the father of Orion, but according to Ovid, his wife had died chidless.

One source calls Hyrieus the father of Crinacus, father of King Macareus of Lesbos.

== Mythology ==

=== Treasury ===
Hyrieus hired Trophonius and Agamedes to build a treasure chamber for him but they also built a secret entrance to it, so that the treasury was easily accessible by removing just one stone from the outside. Using the secret entrance, they would come and steal some of Hyrieus&#x27; possessions. He was dumbfounded at discovering that his fortune was diminishing while the locks and seals remained intact; to catch the thief, he laid a snare. Agamedes was trapped in it; Trophonius cut off his brother&#x27;s head so that Hyrieus would never know the thief&#x27;s identity, and himself disappeared in a chasm of the earth.

=== Orion ===
Some speak of Hyrieus as Orion&#x27;s natural father; others relate that he was childless and a widower and became (technically) adoptive father of Orion via the following circumstances. He was visited by Zeus and Hermes (some add Poseidon), who, to express gratitude for his hospitality, promised him to fulfill a wish of his; he said that he wanted children. The gods filled a sacrificial bull&#x27;s hide with their urine, then told Hyrieus to bury it. Nine months later, Hyrieus found a newborn baby boy inside and named him Orion; Roman authors thought of the Latin word &quot;urina&quot; &quot;urine&quot; as an etymon for Orion&#x27;s name (though actually his name is obviously not of Latin origin). Nonnus, on account of this story, refers to Orion as &quot;having three fathers&quot; and to Gaea (Earth) as his mother.

=== Other myths ===
Hyrieus was said to have expelled Euonymus from the temple of Apollo.

<text>The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today&#x27;s Students is a 1987 book by the philosopher Allan Bloom, in which the author criticizes the openness of relativism, in academia and society in general, as leading paradoxically to the great closing referenced in the book&#x27;s title. In Bloom&#x27;s view, openness undermines critical thinking and eliminates the point of view that defines cultures. The book became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback.

==Summary==
Bloom critiques contemporary higher education in the United States and how he sees it is failing its students, criticizing modern movements in philosophy and the humanities. Throughout the book, he attacks the moral relativism that he claims has taken over American universities for the barrier it constructs to the notions of truth, critical thinking, and genuine knowledge. Bloom claims that students in the 1980s have prioritized the immediate, blind relegation of prejudice as inferiority of thought, and therefore have closed their minds, as the title suggests, to asking the right questions, so that prejudice may be eradicated through logic and critical thinking, as opposed to empty, baseless instinct. Bloom writes, &quot;Prejudices, strong prejudices, are visions about the way things are. ... Error is indeed our enemy, but it alone points to the truth and therefore deserves our respectful treatment. The mind that has no prejudices at the outset is empty.&quot;

===&quot;Students&quot;===

In part one, titled &quot;Students&quot;, Bloom details how the young American mindset, the books, music, relationships, and other aspects of American popular culture contribute to the sanctimony of what he perceives to be dull, lazy minds in American universities today. Bloom contends that the &quot;clean slate&quot;, with which students enter universities, at first made them more susceptible to genuinely embracing the studies of philosophy and logic. Soon enough, because of &quot;[t]he improved education of the vastly expanded middle class [that] weakened the family&#x27;s authority&quot;, there came a &quot;gradual stilling of the old political and religious echoes&quot; in the students Bloom encountered later in his teaching career. He credits the narrowing and flattening of the American college experience to these phenomena.

Bloom then delves into what he believes is the great books dilemma. He believes that the great books of Western thought have been devalued as a source of wisdom—but more importantly, that &quot;our students have lost the practice of and the taste of reading&quot;. Because of this, students are unable to derive their beliefs from evidence, from central texts, or any print source at all. Bloom contends that without an understanding of important older texts, such as Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; or Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot;, modern students lack any reference point with which they can critically think about or address current events. Students are instead left with vague and abstract ideas of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;.

Bloom notes that the &quot;addiction to music&quot; he observes in modern students is unparalleled, and has been for centuries. But even this, he says, contributes to the closing of the young American mind. He notes that fewer and fewer students have a surface level, let alone nuanced, understanding of classical music, and that instead, &quot;rock music is as unquestioned and un-problematic as the air the students breathe.&quot; Pop music, he believes, employs sexual images and language to enthrall the young and to persuade them that their petty rebelliousness is authentic politics, when, in fact, they are being controlled by the money-managers whom successful performers like Mick Jagger quietly serve. He regards the ubiquity of overly sexual overtones in 1980s rock music, and what he perceives to be a subsequent corruption of young minds, as a signal of &quot;parents&#x27; loss of control over the children&#x27;s moral education at a time when no one else is seriously concerned with it.&quot; 
Bloom&#x27;s conclusion about the effects of music on education is that its oversexualization in the late 20th century makes it &quot;very difficult for [students] to have a passionate relationship with the art and thought that are the substance of liberal education, [since] [i]t only artificially induces the exaltation attached to the completion of the greatest endeavors ... like discovery of the truth.&quot; Students no longer seek pleasure from the pursuit of learning.

Bloom concludes in &quot;Students&quot; that because of the relationships students have with popular culture, their family, and their peers, they no longer come to university asking questions, seeking instruction, or with imagination.

===&quot;Nihilism, American Style&quot;===

Bloom titles the second part of the book &quot;Nihilism, American Style&quot;. He introduces in further detail the concept of &quot;value relativism&quot;, mentioned previously only in the introduction. Value relativism, he says, plagues most elite institutions of higher learning. For Bloom, this dissolved into nihilism. He notices that students follow the path of least resistance when developing their values. For students, he writes, &quot;values are not discovered by reason, and it is fruitless to seek them, to find the truth or the good life.&quot; Ironically, when traveling this path without reason, Bloom writes, students still &quot;adopt strong poses and fanatic resolutions.&quot;

Bloom also criticizes his fellow philosophy professors, especially those involved in ordinary language analysis or logical positivism, for disregarding important &quot;humanizing&quot; ethical and political issues and failing to pique the interest of students. Literature professors involved in deconstructionism promote irrationalism and skepticism of standards of truth and thereby dissolve the moral imperatives which are communicated through genuine philosophy and which elevate and broaden the intellects of those who engage with these imperatives. To a great extent, Bloom&#x27;s critique extends beyond the university to speak to what he characterizes as a general crisis in American society. He draws analogies between the United States and the Weimar Republic. The modern liberal philosophy, he says, enshrined in the Enlightenment thought of John Locke—that a just society could be based upon self-interest alone, coupled by the emergence of relativism in American thought—had led to this crisis. Bloom cites Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s actions of telling &quot;modern man that he was free-falling in the abyss of nihilism&quot;, and continues to espouse Nietzsche&#x27;s commentary that nihilism in our contemporary democracy stems from value relativism.

For Bloom, this created a void in the souls of Americans, into which demagogic radicals as exemplified by 1960s student leaders could leap. (Bloom made the comparison to the Brownshirts of the Nazi Party, who once similarly filled the gap created in German society by the Weimar Republic.) In the second instance, he argued, the higher calling of philosophy and reason understood as freedom of thought, had been eclipsed by a pseudo-philosophy, or an ideology of thought. Relativism was one feature of modern American liberal philosophy that had subverted the Platonic–Socratic teaching.

===&quot;The University&quot;===

Bloom contends that the failure of contemporary liberal education leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern students, and to their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits have become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory. In &quot;The University&quot;, he discusses how the environment in elite institutions has cultivated mere ambition over the search for truth. He says that proclaiming an affinity for reason does not alone define a university&#x27;s worth, as the statement alone does not constitute true commitment to scholastic pursuits in the name of a greater truth. He contends that &quot;the mere announcement of the rule of reason does not create the conditions for the full exercise of rationality&quot;. Universities serve as a reflection of the public and democracy at large. Because of this, they are shaped by public opinion (per Alexis de Tocqueville). Public opinion serves as the final gatekeeper and the final headsman for any movements the university may actually try to implement to advance the pursuit of critical thinking.

Bloom also explains what he believes is the dichotomy between the &quot;spirit of the university&quot; and the university itself. &quot;The philosophic life is not the university.&quot; He alludes to early philosophers, from Socrates (who he firmly believes to be &quot;the essence of the university&quot; concept) through the nineteenth century, who he claims never made use of such institutions at all. Bloom posits that maybe, after all, free thought and commitment to a greater truth need not exist within the metaphorical four walls of a university. What matters instead, he says, what is &quot;uniquely human&quot;, is the &quot;philosophic experience&quot;.

Bloom also notices a trend in which students notice the devaluing of free thought in universities. He writes about students at Cornell University, that &quot;these students discerned that their teachers did not really believe that freedom of thought was necessarily a good and useful thing, that they suspected that all this was ideology protecting the injustices of our &#x27;system&#x27;&quot;. Bloom asserts that American professors in the sixties &quot;were not aware of what they no longer believed&quot; and that this notion gravely endangered any capacity for progress towards free thought. Bloom insists that requiring from universities empty values like &quot;greater openness&quot;, &quot;less rigidity&quot;, and &quot;freedom from authority&quot; are only fashionable and do not have any substantive content. And in the face of growing civil rights conflicts, universities have a duty to instead actively pursue the task of &quot;opening American minds&quot;. It is not enough, Bloom contends, for universities to &quot;not want trouble&quot;. It is not enough for universities to only hold reputation paramount in the face of campus disruption, and only in name espouse free thought and truth. This &quot;unfortunate mixture of cowardice and moralism&quot; will unseat the spirit of the university. Bloom concludes by reminding readers that the love of wisdom and truth must be kept alive in universities, particularly in this moment of world history.

==Publication==
&quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; was published in March 1987, five years after Bloom published an essay in the &quot;National Review&quot; about the failure of universities to serve the needs of students. With the encouragement of Saul Bellow, his colleague at the University of Chicago, he expanded his thoughts into a book &quot;about a life, I&#x27;ve led&quot; that critically reflected on the current state of higher education in American universities. His friends and admirers imagined the work would be a modest success, as did Bloom, who recognized his publisher&#x27;s modest advance to complete the project as a lack of sales confidence. Yet on the momentum of strong initial reviews, including one by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and an op-ed piece by syndicated conservative commentator George Will entitled &quot;A How-To Book for the Independent&quot; it became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback and remaining at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Non-fiction Best Seller list for four months.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; was met with mixed reviews from scholars and the general public alike.

===Positive===

The art critic Roger Kimball, wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, that Bloom&#x27;s work should not be diminished publicly simply because it is not optimistic. Instead, he writes, &quot;&#x27;The Closing of the American Mind&#x27; is essential reading for anyone concerned with the state of liberal education in this society. Its pathos, erudition and penetrating insight make it an unparalleled reflection on the whole question of what it means to be a student in today&#x27;s intellectual and moral climate.&quot; He concludes that,
Matt Feeney from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; also wrote in his article, &quot;Allan Bloom&#x27;s Guide to College&quot;, in 2012, that while Bloom&#x27;s core arguments may have been diluted into trite conservative barbs directed at liberal educations, the essence of his argument remains true today, and his motives do too. He explains that by writing &quot;The Closing of the American Mind,&quot; &quot;Bloom dangles the promise of an arousing and dangerous philosophical quest, which will take the student far from his (and his friends&#x27; and parents&#x27; and other professors&#x27;) settled opinions about what is good and decent.&quot; As for Bloom&#x27;s impact on this era of politics, Feeney suggests a reframe in the way consumers perceive Bloom&#x27;s work. Feeney writes,
The neoconservative writer Norman Podhoretz embraced Bloom&#x27;s argument, noting that the closed-mindedness in his title refers to the paradoxical consequence of the academic &quot;open mind&quot; found in liberal political thought—namely &quot;the narrow and intolerant dogmatism&quot; that dismisses any attempt, by Plato or the Hebrew Bible for example, to provide a rational basis for moral judgments. Podhoretz continued, &quot;Bloom goes on to charge liberalism with vulgarizing the noble ideals of freedom and equality, and he offers brilliantly acerbic descriptions of the sexual revolution and the feminist movement, which he sees as products of this process of vulgarization.&quot; Bloom&#x27;s work was also supported by a larger conservative movement. In 2005, Jim Sleeper wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;nothing prepared [conservatives&#x27;] movement, or the academic and publishing worlds, for the wildfire success of [the book]. ... Conservatives championed Bloom then, of course, and they invoke him still.&quot;

In a 1989 article, Ann Clark Fehn discussed the critical reception of the book, noting that it had eclipsed other titles that year dealing with higher education (&quot;College&quot; by Ernest L. Boyer and &quot;Cultural Literacy&quot; by E. D. Hirsch), and quoting &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, which had described Bloom&#x27;s book as a &quot;bestseller made by reviews&quot;. The poet Frederick Turner described &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; as, &quot;The most thoughtful conservative analysis of the nation&#x27;s cultural sickness.&quot;

The critic Camille Paglia called &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; &quot;the first shot in the culture wars&quot;, writing of Bloom that she was &quot;confident that in the long run he will be vindicated and his critics swallowed in obscurity&quot;.

===Negative===

In her review, Martha Nussbaum questioned whether Bloom deserved to be considered a philosopher. The criticism of the book was continued by impassioned reviews by Benjamin Barber in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;; by Alexander Nehamas in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;; and by David Rieff in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. David Rieff called Bloom &quot;an academic version of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North: vengeful, reactionary, antidemocratic.&quot; The book, he said, was one that &quot;decent people would be ashamed of having written.&quot; The tone of these reviews led James Atlas in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; to conclude &quot;the responses to Bloom&#x27;s book have been charged with a hostility that transcends the usual mean-spiritedness of reviewers.&quot;

William Greider wrote for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that there were two main reasons for the roaring commercial success of Bloom&#x27;s work. The first, he says, is purely due to the &quot;impassioned quality of Bloom&#x27;s prose. The professor&#x27;s rhetoric is laced with high-blown discourses on his great-books heroes and his enemies list ... The average reader is undoubtedly flattered by Bloom&#x27;s intellectual name-dropping; it&#x27;s always fun to be high-minded about someone else&#x27;s ignorance.&quot; According to Greider, the second reason behind Bloom&#x27;s success is timing. He writes that &quot;the book&#x27;s appearance coincides with a surge of national concern about the disappearance of traditional education. Another current best seller, &quot;Cultural Literacy&quot;, by E.D. Hirsch Jr., also taps the same anxieties.&quot; Ultimately, Greider concludes that Bloom&#x27;s agenda is simply a vicious attack on the values of young America. He writes,

For Greider, it is unfathomable how Bloom could revile the decline in prejudice and relegate that decline to a lack of imagination. He concludes, &quot;Bloom apparently detests the young.&quot;

===Legacy===

The jurist Richard Posner compared Bloom&#x27;s book to Paglia&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; (1990), finding both books to be examples of &quot;difficult academic works that mysteriously strike a chord with a broad public.&quot; Thus, since publication, &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; fueled many impassioned debates about the state of culture in America. In retaliation the American historian Lawrence W. Levine wrote &quot;The Opening of the American Mind&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Edward Rothstein, Levine&#x27;s work, published ten full years later, still found it relevant to &quot;praise what Bloom condemned and condemn what he praised.&quot; But where, initially, political conservatives espoused Bloom&#x27;s theories and liberals disavowed them, things seemed to be changing. According to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, the lines between supporter and opponent were no longer so clear. He found that, &quot;many conservatives have no problem with diversity if it is accompanied by rigor; many liberals have no problem with rigor if it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary culture is becoming increasingly widespread.&quot; Ultimately, Rothstein concludes, Bloom&#x27;s work has very little to do &quot;with current political demarcations.&quot;

Conversely, Jerry Aaron Snyder of &quot;The New Republic&quot; argues that the culture wars, which Bloom&#x27;s work clearly helped spark a conversation about, will consistently be relevant. While it may be argued that &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; may not resign itself to a political party, this does not preclude it from the impact it had on the culture wars, and how those culture wars shape life today. Snyder argues that books like Bloom&#x27;s have inspired further conversations and controversies alike, such as controversy surrounding how history is taught in high schools, or the effectiveness of affirmative action or identity politics. According to Snyder, the discussions spawned by the initial culture wars in the 1980s because of books like Bloom&#x27;s, &quot;&#x27;the soul of America&#x27; is a bottomless well. For better or worse, it will never run dry.&quot;

<text>Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction is a 1995 pseudo-documentary containing grainy black and white footage of a hoaxed alien autopsy. In 1995, film purporting to show an alien autopsy conducted shortly after the Roswell incident was released by British entrepreneur Ray Santilli. The footage aired on television networks around the world. Fox television broadcast the purported autopsy, hosted by Jonathan Frakes, on August 28, 1995, under the title &quot;Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction&quot;, and re-broadcast it twice, each time to higher ratings. The footage was also broadcast on UK&#x27;s Channel 4, and repackaged for the home video market. The program was an overnight sensation, with &quot;Time&quot; magazine declaring that the film had sparked a debate &quot;with an intensity not lavished on any home movie since the Zapruder film&quot;.

The program was thoroughly debunked; the footage was shot on an inexpensive set constructed in a London living room. Its alien bodies were hollow plaster casts filled with offal, sheep brains, and raspberry jam. Multiple participants in &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot; stated that misleading editing had removed their opinions that the footage was a hoax. Santilli admitted in 2006 that the film was a fake, though he continued to claim it was inspired by genuine, but lost footage.

==Production==
On April 4, 2006, days before the release of the British feature film, &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot;, Sky broadcast a documentary, &quot;Eamonn Investigates: Alien Autopsy&quot;, presented by Eamonn Holmes. In this program, Ray Santilli and fellow producer Gary Shoefield admitted that they had created the 1995 footage.

Shoefield and Santilli had filmed a simulated autopsy on a fabricated alien, based upon what Santilli claimed to see in 1992. According to Santilli, a set was constructed in the living room of an empty flat in Rochester Square, Camden Town, London. John Humphreys, an artist and sculptor, was employed to construct two dummy alien bodies over three weeks. He filled plaster cast sculptures of alien bodies with raspberry jam, sheep brains, chicken entrails, and knuckle joints obtained from a butcher to serve as organs. Humphreys also played the role of the chief examiner, to allow him to control the effects being filmed. There were two separate attempts at making the footage. After filming, the team disposed of the &quot;bodies&quot; by cutting them into small pieces and placing them in rubbish bins across London.

Alien artifacts, supposedly items recovered from the crash site, were depicted in the footage. These included alien symbols and six-finger control panels, which Santilli describes as being the result of artistic license on his part. These artifacts were also created by Humphreys. The footage also showed a man reading a statement &quot;verifying&quot; his identity as the original cameraman and the source of the footage. Santilli and Shoefield admitted in the 2006 documentary that they had found an unidentified homeless man on the streets of Los Angeles, persuaded him to play the role of the cameraman, and filmed him in a motel.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Alien Autopsy&quot; was derided in the media. In 1995, &quot;The X-Files&quot; featured alien autopsy footage that the skeptical Agent Scully decries as &quot;even than the one they aired on the Fox network&quot;. It was satirized again in the 1996 &quot;X-Files&quot; episode Jose Chung&#x27;s From Outer Space. In 1998, Fox aired a new special, &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Hoaxes and Secrets Revealed!&quot;, which debunked the 1995 footage. A fictionalized version of the creation of the footage and its release was retold in the comedy film &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot; (2006).

<doc id="84473" wikidata="Q1770035" url="?curid=84473" title="Dead code">
<text>The term dead code has multiple definitions. Some use the term to refer to code (i.e. instructions in memory) which can never be executed at run-time.
In some areas of computer programming, dead code is a section in the source code of a program which is executed but whose result is never used in any other computation. The execution of dead code wastes computation time and memory.

While the result of a dead computation may never be used, it may raise exceptions or affect some global state, thus removal of such code may change the output of the program and introduce unintended bugs. Compiler optimizations are typically conservative in their approach to dead-code removal if there is any ambiguity as to whether removal of the dead code will affect the program output. The programmer may aid the compiler in this matter by making additional use of static and/or inline functions and enabling the use of link-time optimization.

== Example ==
int foo (int iX, int iY)
 int iZ = iX/iY;

 return iX*iY;


In the above example, although the division of by is computed and never used, it will throw an exception when a division by zero occurs. Therefore, the removal of the dead code may change the output of the program.

== Analysis ==

Dead-code elimination is a form of compiler optimization in which dead code is removed from a program. Dead code analysis can be performed using live-variable analysis, a form of static-code analysis and data-flow analysis. This is in contrast to unreachable code analysis which is based on control-flow analysis.

The dead-code elimination technique is in the same class of optimizations as unreachable code elimination and redundant code elimination.

In large programming projects, it is sometimes difficult to recognize and eliminate dead code, particularly when entire modules become dead. Test scaffolding can make it appear that the code is still live, and at times, contract language can require delivery of the code even when the code is no longer relevant.

Some IDEs (such as Xcode, Visual Studio 2010 and Eclipse Galileo) have the ability to locate dead code during the compiling stage.

While most optimization techniques seek to remove dead code in an implementation, in extreme forms of optimization for size it may sometimes be desirable to deliberately introduce and carefully shape seemingly dead code, when it allows to fold otherwise unrelated code sections together (and thereby reduce their combined size) so that the extra code will effectively not harm the first path of execution through the code but is used to carry out the actions necessary for the alternative paths of execution, for which other sections of the code may become dead code. On a more functional level, this can be seen as both, artificially introduction of harmless/useful side-effects and reduction of the redundancy of the code, but it can also be used down to opcode level in order to allow the usage of shorter instructions, which would not be possible when folding code sequences without the concerted introduction of side-effects caused by the dead code.

<text>Lawrence Neville Brand (August 13, 1920 – April 16, 1992) was an American soldier and actor. He was known for playing villainous or antagonistic character roles in Westerns, crime dramas, and &quot;films noir&quot;, and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for his performance in &quot;Riot in Cell Block 11&quot; (1954).

During World War II, Brand served in the 331st Infantry Regiment of the 83rd Infantry Division in the U.S. Army, in the European theatre. He received multiple meritorious citations for his service, including the Silver Star and the Purple Heart.

== Early years ==
Brand was born in Griswold, Iowa, and raised in Kewanee, Illinois. After he graduated from high school, he joined the Army.

== War service ==

Brand entered the Illinois Army National Guard on October 23, 1939, as a private in Company F, 129th Infantry Regiment. He was enlisted in the United States Army as Corporal Neville L. Brand, infantryman on March 5, 1941. He trained at Fort Carson and served in World War II, seeing action with B Company, 331st Infantry Regiment of the 83rd Infantry Division (Thunderbolt Division) in the Ardennes, Rhineland and Central European campaigns. Brand, a sergeant and platoon leader, was wounded in action along the Weser River on April 7, 1945. He was shot in the upper right arm and nearly bled to death.

Brand was awarded the Silver Star, the third-highest decoration for valor in the U.S. military, for gallantry in combat. His other awards and decorations were the Purple Heart, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three Battle Stars, one Overseas Service Bar, one Service Stripe and the Combat Infantryman Badge. In a 1966 interview Brand explained the Silver Star, stating that withering fire from German machine guns in a hunting lodge kept him and his unit pinned down. &quot;I must have flipped my lid,&quot; he said. &quot;I decided to go into that lodge.&quot; He was discharged in October 1945.

Brand was sometimes cited in media reports as the 4th most-decorated American serviceman of the war, but this was incorrect and repeatedly denied by Brand himself.

=== Medals and ribbons ===

World War II Victory Medal 

Bronze Star Medal for Meritorious Service 

American Campaign Medal 

Army Occupation Medal

==Acting career==
===Early roles===
After his discharge, Brand worked on a 1946 Army Signal Corps film with Charlton Heston and next settled in Greenwich Village and enrolled at the American Theatre Wing, working off-Broadway, including Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;The Victors&quot;. He also attended the Geller Drama School in Los Angeles on the G.I. Bill.

Brand had an uncredited bit in &quot;Battleground&quot; (1949) and &quot;Port of New York&quot; (1949). His first credited part was in &quot;D.O.A.&quot; (1950) as a henchman named Chester. His hulking physique, rough-hewn, craggy-faced looks and gravelly voice led to his largely playing gangsters, Western outlaws and various screen &quot;heavies&quot;, cops and other tough-guy roles throughout his career.

Brand was uncredited in &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; (1949), &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot; (1950) (both starring Dana Andrews), and curiously &quot;Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye&quot; where he plays a significant early role as James Cagney&#x27;s fellow chain gang inmate, (1950) but had a good role on TV in &quot;The Bigelow Theatre&quot;. His parts slowly grew bigger: &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot; (1951), &quot;Only the Valiant&quot; (1951), &quot;The Mob&quot; (1951), and &quot;Red Mountain&quot; (1951).
On television, he did a short, &quot;Benjy&quot; (1951), and episodes of &quot;The Unexpected&quot; and &quot;Your Favorite Story&quot;. He was in &quot;Kansas City Confidential&quot; (1952), &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1952), and, notably, &quot;Stalag 17&quot; (1953).

===Leading man===
As a supporting actor, he appeared in &quot;The Charge at Feather River&quot; (1953), &quot;The Man from the Alamo&quot; (1953), and &quot;Gun Fury&quot; (1953). Brand moved up to leading roles with &quot;Man Crazy&quot; (1953) and then &quot;Riot in Cell Block 11&quot; (1954). The latter role, as the leader of a prison uprising, earned him a BAFTA nomination for Best Foreign Actor at the 8th British Academy Film Awards, but he lost to Marlon Brando for &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. Brand was down the cast list for &quot;The Lone Gun&quot; (1954) but had the lead in &quot;Return from the Sea&quot; (1954).

Brand had a supporting role in &quot;The Prodigal&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Return of Jack Slade&quot; and guest roles in &quot;Appointment with Adventure&quot;, &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre&quot;, &quot;Chevron Hall of Stars&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, and &quot;Stage 7&quot;.

He had lead film roles in &quot;Bobby Ware Is Missing&quot; (1955) and &quot;Fury at Gunsight Pass&quot; (1956) and supported in &quot;Raw Edge&quot; (1956), and &quot;Mohawk&quot; (1956). He had the distinction of being the first actor to portray outlaw Butch Cassidy, in the film &quot;The Three Outlaws&quot; opposite Alan Hale Jr. as the Sundance Kid. He followed it with &quot;Gun Brothers&quot; (1956).

Brand became well known as a villain when he killed the character played by Elvis Presley in his debut film &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; (1956). He was in &quot;The Way to the Gold&quot; (1957), &quot;The Lonely Man&quot; (1957), &quot;The Tin Star&quot; (1957), &quot;Cry Terror!&quot; (1958), and &quot;Badman&#x27;s Country&quot; (1958).

He often had better roles on television, including such shows as &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Target&quot; and notably an adaptation of &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; for &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;, directed by Sidney Lumet, playing Willie Stark, for which he earned a Sylvania Award in 1958.

Brand was a guest star on &quot;The Texan&quot;, &quot;Pursuit&quot;, &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;, and &quot;The Dupont Show of the Month&quot; (doing &quot;Body and Soul&quot; with Ben Gazzara).

===Al Capone and other TV roles===
Brand twice portrayed Al Capone on the television series &quot;The Untouchables,&quot; in the pilot and opening scene of the premiere &quot;The Empty Chair&quot; (although uncredited) and then in the double episode &quot;The Big Train&quot;; as well as often glimpses in flashback throughout the series.

Brand was in &quot;Five Gates to Hell&quot; (1959), &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1960), &quot;The Last Sunset&quot; (1961), and &quot;The George Raft Story&quot; (1961), reprising his role as Al Capone in the latter.

He guest-starred on &quot;Straightaway&quot;, &quot;Cain&#x27;s Hundred&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, &quot;Theatre of Stars&quot;, &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, &quot;Destry&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;The Virginian&quot;.

He also portrayed a prison guard of &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot;, was second billed in &quot;Hero&#x27;s Island&quot; (1962) and had a key role in &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; (1965).

Brand co-starred with George Takei in &quot;The Encounter,&quot; a 1964 episode of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, as a World War II veteran. CBS considered the episode&#x27;s theme of US-Japanese hatred &quot;too disturbing&quot; to include when the series was syndicated. &quot;The Encounter&quot; was not seen after its initial airing until it was released on video in 1992 as part of the &quot;Treasures of the Twilight Zone&quot; collection.

Brand was given the star role in a TV series, &quot;Laredo&quot; (1965–67) which ran for 56 episodes.

Brand was in &quot;The Desperados&quot; (1969) and played U.S. Navy Lieutenant Kaminsky, ignored as he tried to warn his commander of the opening skirmish in &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970).

===1970s===
In the 1970s, Brand could be seen in &quot;The Chicago Teddy Bears&quot; and &quot;The Smith Family&quot;. He played Hoss Cartwright&#x27;s (Dan Blocker) Swedish uncle Gunnar Borgstrom on &quot;Bonanza&quot; in the episode &quot;The Last Viking&quot;.

He appeared in &quot;Longstreet&quot;, &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Two for the Money&quot; (1972), &quot;No Place to Run&quot; (1972), &quot;The Police Connection&quot; (1972), &quot;Cahill U.S. Marshal&quot; (1973), &quot;Scalawag&quot; (1973), &quot;The Magician&quot;, &quot;The Deadly Trackers&quot; (1973), &quot;Killdozer&quot; (1974), &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;Barbary Coast&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Mobile One&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, &quot;Psychic Killer&quot; (1975), &quot;The Quest&quot;, and &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot;.

Brand was top billed in &quot;Eaten Alive&quot; (1976) directed by Tobe Hooper. He was in &quot;Fire!&quot; (1977), &quot;The Mouse and His Child&quot; (1977), &quot;Baretta&quot;, &quot;Captains Courageous&quot;, &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Quincy M.E.&quot;, &quot;The Seekers&quot; and &quot;Hi-Riders&quot; (1978). He had a key part in &quot;Five Days from Home&quot; (1978) directed by George Peppard, and in &quot;Angels&#x27; Brigade&quot; (1979).

===1980s===
In 1980, Brand appeared as Major Marvin Groper in &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot;, written and directed by &quot;The Exorcist&quot; author William Peter Blatty.

His final roles included &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Without Warning&quot; (1980), &quot;Harper Valley P.T.A.&quot;, and &quot;The Return&quot; (1982). He was top billed in his last film, &quot;Evils of the Night&quot; (1985).

==Personal life==
Brand and his wife, Rae, had three daughters. A Republican, he supported the campaign of Dwight Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential election. In addition, Brand was also a self-described lifelong Presbyterian.

Brand was an insatiable reader who amassed a collection of 30,000 books over the years, one of the largest private libraries in Los Angeles. Most of his collection was destroyed in a 1978 fire at his Malibu home.

His wartime service caused him post-traumatic stress disorder that led to bouts of alcoholism. In 1975, he said in an interview that his addiction had cost him most of his fortune.

==Death==
Brand died from emphysema at Sutter General Hospital in Sacramento, California, on April 16, 1992, at the age of 71. After a private funeral service he was cremated, and his remains were interred in a niche of the Morning Glory Room at East Lawn Memorial Park in Sacramento.

<text>Ventura Publisher was the first popular desktop publishing package for IBM PC compatible computers running the GEM extension to the DOS operating system. The software was originally developed by Ventura Software, a small software company founded by Michael john Meyer, Don Heiskell, and Lee Jay Lorenzen, all of whom met while working at Digital Research. It ran under an included run-time copy of Digital Research&#x27;s GEM.

==History==

The first version of Ventura Publisher was released in late 1986, with worldwide distribution by Xerox. Xerox would later purchase all rights to the source code from Ventura Software in 1990.

Ventura Publisher had some text editing and line drawing capabilities of its own, but it was designed to interface with a wide variety of word processing and graphics programs rather than to supplant them. To that end, text was stored in, loaded from, and saved back to word processor files in the native formats of a variety of word processors, including WordPerfect, WordStar, and early versions of Microsoft Word, rather than being incorporated into the chapter files. This allowed users to continue using their favorite word processors for major text changes, spelling checks, and so forth. Paragraphs other than default body text were tagged with descriptive tagnames that were entirely user-defined, and characters and attributes that have no native equivalent in a given word processor were represented with standardized sequences of characters. When working with the files outside of Ventura Publisher, these paragraph tags and special character and attribute codes could be freely changed, the same as any other text. These tags looked very much like HTML tags.
Ventura Publisher was the first major typesetting program to incorporate the concept of an implicit &quot;underlying page&quot; frame, and one of the first to incorporate a strong &quot;style sheet&quot; concept. It produced documents with a high degree of internal consistency, unless specifically overridden by the user. Its concepts of free-flowing text, paragraph tagging, and codes for attributes and special characters anticipated similar concepts inherent in HTML and XML. Likewise, its concept of &quot;publication&quot; files that tie together &quot;chapter&quot; files gave it the ability to handle documents hundreds (or even thousands) of pages in length as easily as a four-page newsletter.

The major strengths of the original DOS/GEM edition of Ventura Publisher were:
* Its ability to run, with reasonable response times, on a wide range of hardware (including 8086- and 286-based computers)
* Its ability to produce, by default, documents with a high degree of internal consistency
* Its automatic re-exporting of text to native word processor formats
* Its ability to print to a wide variety of devices, including PostScript, PCL, and InterPress laser printers and imagesetters, as well as certain popular dot-matrix and inkjet printers.

The original Ventura Software ceased operations in February 1990, and a new Ventura Software Inc. was formed at that time, an affiliated company of Xerox. The developers from the original company worked with the new Xerox Ventura Software company to produce Version 3.0 Gold. This was released in late 1990. Besides DOS/GEM, it was also available for Win16, Mac, and OS/2.

The three founders of the original Ventura Software no longer worked on the product after November 1990.

Version 4.0 was released in 1991. The last version released by Ventura Software Inc. was 4.1.1 in 1993.

The application was acquired by Corel in 1993. It was repackaged and soon released as Corel Ventura 4.2 without any major change in the application, other than to drop all support for platforms other than Microsoft Windows.

The first real Corel version was 5.0 (released in 1994), which made fundamental changes to both user interface and document structure. Because of this, and because of escalating hardware requirements of the various Corel versions, the original DOS/GEM edition still has a small number of die-hard users.

The application was rewritten for the Win32 platform and was released in 1996, labeled Corel Ventura 7 (instead of 6) so that it would match the version number of CorelDRAW. Corel Ventura 8 was released in 1998. The last published version was Corel Ventura 10 in 2002 (last updated in February 2003); it reportedly runs in Windows 10 under compatibility mode with some functional limitations after workarounds, and on Linux via Wine (verified in April 2020).

As an application with strengths in more structured documents, its main competitors were FrameMaker, QuarkXPress and later InDesign.

==Reception==
Approving of its &quot;general excellence&quot;, Ian McKinnell of &quot;Personal Computer World&quot; wrote in January 1987 that Ventura Publisher for GEM was immediately usable with his Macintosh experience, and cited the macro feature as &quot;a real improvement over Pagemaker on the Macintosh&quot;. He concluded that while it would not cause new users to buy a PC, for existing owners &quot;Ventura Publisher is well worth investigating&quot;.

<text>Cargo cult programming is a style of computer programming characterized by the ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose. Cargo cult programming is symptomatic of a programmer not understanding either a bug they were attempting to solve or the apparent solution (compare shotgun debugging, deep magic). The term &quot;cargo cult programmer&quot; may apply when anyone inexperienced with the problem at hand copies some program code from one place to another with little understanding of how it works or whether it is required.

Cargo cult programming can also refer to the practice of applying a design pattern or coding style blindly without understanding the reasons behind that design principle. Some examples are adding unnecessary comments to self-explanatory code, overzealous adherence to the conventions of a programming paradigm, or adding deletion code for objects that garbage collection automatically collects.

==Etymology==
Cargo cults are millenarian movements that arose in Melanesia under colonial rule, and inspired Richard Feynman to coin the expression cargo cult science. In Feynman&#x27;s description, after the end of the Second World War practitioners believed that air delivery of cargo would resume if they carried out the proper rituals, such as building runways, lighting fires next to them, and wearing headphones carved from wood while sitting in fabricated control towers. &quot;The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn’t work.&quot;

The term then became used more widely as a metaphor for empty rituals. The term &quot;cargo-cult programming&quot; appeared in version 2.5.1 of the Jargon File, a glossary of computing slang, released in January 1991. The term &quot;cargo cult&quot; in anthropology, meanwhile, is increasingly avoided for failing to represent the complexity of Melanesian beliefs.

==Cargo cult software engineering==
A related term to cargo cult programming in software engineering is &quot;cargo cult software engineering&quot;, coined by Steve McConnell.

McConnell describes software development organizations that attempt to emulate more successful development houses, either by slavishly following a software development process without understanding the reasoning behind it, or by attempting to emulate a commitment-oriented development approach (in which software developers devote large amounts of time and energy toward seeing their projects succeed) by mandating the long hours and unpaid overtime, while in successful companies these might instead be consequences of high motivation instead of causes of success.

In both cases, McConnell contends that competence ultimately determines whether a project succeeds or fails, regardless of the development approach taken; furthermore, he claims that incompetent &quot;imposter organizations&quot; (which merely imitate the &quot;form&quot; of successful software development organizations) are in fact engaging in what he calls &quot;cargo cult software engineering&quot;.

<doc id="84486" wikidata="Q120638097" url="?curid=84486" title="Portage">
<text>Portage or portaging ( ; ) is the practice of carrying water craft or cargo over land, either around an obstacle in a river, or between two bodies of water. A path where items are regularly carried between bodies of water is also called a &quot;portage.&quot; The term comes from French, where means &quot;to carry&quot;, as in &quot;portable&quot;. In Canada, the term &quot;carrying-place&quot; was sometimes used.

Early French explorers in New France and French Louisiana encountered many rapids and cascades. The Native Americans carried their canoes over land to avoid river obstacles.

Over time, important portages were sometimes provided with canals with locks, and even portage railways. Primitive portaging generally involves carrying the vessel and its contents across the portage in multiple trips. Small canoes can be portaged by carrying them inverted over one&#x27;s shoulders and the center strut may be designed in the style of a yoke to facilitate this. Historically, voyageurs often employed tump lines on their heads to carry loads on their backs.

Portages can be many kilometers in length, such as the Methye Portage and the Grand Portage (both in North America) often covering hilly or difficult terrain. Some portages involve very little elevation change, such as the very short Mavis Grind in Shetland, which crosses an isthmus.

==Technique==
This section deals mostly with the heavy freight canoes used by the Canadian Voyageurs.

Portage trails usually began as animal tracks and were improved by tramping or blazing. In a few places iron-plated wooden rails were laid to take a handcart. Heavily used routes sometimes evolved into roads when sledges, rollers or oxen were used, as at Methye Portage. Sometimes railways (Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad) or canals were built.

When going downstream through rapids an experienced voyageur called the &quot;guide&quot; would inspect the rapids and choose between the heavy work of a portage and the life-threatening risk of running the rapids. If the second course were chosen, the boat would be controlled by the &quot;avant&quot; standing in front with a long paddle and the &quot;gouvernail&quot; standing in the back with a steering paddle. The &quot;avant&quot; had a better view and was in charge but the &quot;gouvernail&quot; had more control over the boat. The other canoemen provided power under the instructions of the &quot;avant.&quot; 
Going upstream was more difficult, as there were many places where the current was too swift to paddle. Where the river bottom was shallow and firm, voyageurs would stand in the canoe and push it upstream with poles. If the shoreline was reasonably clear the canoe could be &#x27;tracked&#x27; or &#x27;lined&#x27;, that is, the canoemen would pull the canoe on a rope while one man stayed on board to keep it away from the shore. (The most extreme case of tracking was in the Three Gorges in China where all boats had to be pulled upstream against the current of the Yangtze River.) In worse conditions, the &#x27;demi-chargé&#x27; technique was used. Half the cargo was unloaded, the canoe forced upstream, unloaded and then returned downstream to pick up the remaining half of the cargo. In still worse currents, the entire cargo was unloaded (&#x27;décharge&#x27;) and carried overland while the canoe was forced upstream. In the worst case a full portage was necessary. The canoe was carried overland by two or four men (the heavier York boats had to be dragged overland on rollers) The cargo was divided into standard packs or &quot;pièces&quot; with each man responsible for about six. One portage or canoe pack would be carried by a tumpline and one on the back (strangulated hernia was a common cause of death). To allow regular rests the voyageur would drop his pack at a &quot;pose&quot; about every and go back for the next load. The time for a portage was estimated at one hour per half mile.

==History==

===Europe===

====Greco-Roman world====
The &quot;Diolkos&quot; was a paved trackway in Ancient Greece which enabled boats to be moved overland across the Isthmus of Corinth between the Gulf of Corinth and the Saronic Gulf. It was constructed to transport high ranking Despots to conduct business in the justice system. The roadway was a rudimentary form of railway, and operated from around 600 BC until the middle of the 1st century AD.

The scale on which the Diolkos combined the two principles of the railway and the overland transport of ships was unique in antiquity.

There is scant literary evidence for two more ship trackways referred to as diolkoi in antiquity, both located in Roman Egypt: The physician Oribasius () records two passages from his first-century colleague Xenocrates, in which the latter casually refers to a diolkos close to the harbor of Alexandria, which may have been located at the southern tip of the island of Pharos. Another diolkos is mentioned by Ptolemy (90–168 CE) in his book on geography (IV, 5, 10) as connecting a false mouth of a partly silted up Nile branch with the Mediterranean Sea.

Writing in the first half of the eighth century, Cosmas of Jerusalem describes the portage of boats across the narrowest part of the Thracian Chersonese (Gallipoli Peninsula) between the Aegean Sea and the Sea of Marmara. The peninsula there is six miles wide. Cosmas describes the dragging of small boats as common in his day for local trade between Thrace and Gothograecia. The motivation for this practice was to avoid the long detour around the peninsula and through the Dardanelles, but also to avoid the customs house at Abydos. It would have been too costly to regularly move large ships across the peninsula, but Cosmas says that Constantine IV did it, presumably during the blockade of Constantinople (670/1–676/7) when the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles were controlled by the Umayyads. Constantine is said to have &quot;driven&quot; the ships rather than dragged them, probably indicating the use of wheels. Archaeological evidence for a portage across the Thracian Chersonese is lacking, but it is possible that traces of it have been confused with traces of the Long Wall, which was restored by Justinian I in the 6th century. The region also saw extensive damage during the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915.

====Pre-Viking and Viking era northern Germany====
The Skagerak always has been treacherous for shipping and early navigators tried to avoid it. There are various river systems in (modern) northern Germany and southern Denmark where the watershed is narrow and low, such as between the Treene (discharging into the North Sea) and the Schlei (discharging into the Baltic) that would have allowed portage. There is no certain physical or written evidence, except that it is known that goods were transported along these routes between different merchant settlements.

====Venetian Republic====

The land link between Adige River and Garda Lake in Northern Italy, hardly used by the smallest watercraft, was at least once used by the Venetian Republic for the transport of a military fleet in 1439. The land link is now somewhat harder because of the disappearance of Loppio Lake.

====Russia====

In the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries, Viking merchant-adventurers exploited a network of waterways in Eastern Europe, with portages connecting the four most important rivers of the region: Volga, Western Dvina, Dnieper, and Don. The portages of what is now Russia were vital for the Varangian commerce with the Orient and Byzantium.

At the most important portages (such as Gnezdovo) there were trade outposts inhabited by a mixture of Norse merchants and native population. The Khazars built the fortress of Sarkel to guard a key portage between the Volga and the Don. After Varangian and Khazar power in Eastern Europe waned, Slavic merchants continued to use the portages along the Volga trade route and the Dnieper trade route.

The names of the towns Volokolamsk and Vyshny Volochek may be translated as &quot;the portage on the Lama River&quot; and &quot;the little upper portage&quot;, respectively (from Russian , meaning &quot;portage&quot;, derived from the verb &quot;to drag&quot;).

In the 16th century, the Russians used river portages to get to Siberia (see Cherdyn Road).

====Scotland and Ireland====
Tarbert is a common place name in Scotland and Ireland indicating the site of a portage.

===Africa===
Portages played an important role in the economy of some African societies. For instance, Bamako was chosen as the capital of Mali because it is located on the Niger River near the rapids that divide the Upper and Middle Niger Valleys.

===North America===
Places where portaging occurred often became temporary and then permanent settlements. The importance of free passage through portages found them included in laws and treaties. One historically important fur trade portage is now Grand Portage National Monument. Recreational canoeing routes often include portages between lakes, for example, the Seven Carries route in Adirondack Park. (In the Adirondacks, a portage is traditionally called a &quot;Carry.&quot;)

Numerous portages were upgraded to carriageways and railways due to their economic importance. The Niagara Portage had a gravity railway in the 1760s. The passage between the Chicago and Des Plaines Rivers was through a short swamp portage which seasonally flooded and it is thought that a channel gradually developed unintentionally from the dragging of the boat bottoms. The 1835 Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad connected the cities of New York and Montreal without needing to go through the Atlantic.

Many settlements in North America were named for being on a portage.

===Oceania===

====New Zealand====

Portages existed in a number of locations where an isthmus existed that the local Māori could drag or carry their waka across from the Tasman Sea to the Pacific Ocean or vice versa. The most famous ones are located in Auckland, where there remain three roads named &#x27;Portage Road&#x27;s in separate parts of the city. Portage Road in the Auckland suburb of Otahuhu has historical plaques at both the north and south ends proclaiming it to be &#x27;at half a mile in length, surely the shortest road between two seas&#x27;.

The small Marlborough Sounds settlement of Portage lies on the Kenepuru Sound which links Queen Charlotte Sound at Torea Bay. This portage was created by mid-19th century settler Robert Blaymires.

<doc id="84487" wikidata="Q284" url="?curid=84487" title="Cognac">
<text>Cognac ( , , ) is a variety of brandy named after the commune of Cognac, France. It is produced in the surrounding wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime.

Cognac production falls under French appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée (AOC) designation, with production methods and naming required to meet certain legal requirements. Among the specified grapes, Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-Émilion, is most widely used. The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in French oak barrels from Limousin or Tronçais. Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wines barrel-age, and most cognacs spend considerably longer &quot;on the wood&quot; than the minimum legal requirement.

==Production process==
Cognac is a type of brandy, and after the distillation and during the aging process, is also called &quot;eau de vie&quot;. It is produced by twice distilling wine made from grapes grown in any of the designated growing regions.

===Grapes===
The white wine used in making cognac is very dry, acidic, and thin. Though it has been characterised as &quot;virtually undrinkable&quot;, it is excellent for distillation and aging. It may be made only from a strict list of grape varieties. For it to be considered a true &quot;cru&quot; cognac, the white wine must be made from at least 90% Ugni blanc (known in Italy as Trebbiano), Folle blanche and Colombard, while up to 10% of the grapes used can be Folignan, Jurançon blanc, Meslier St-François (also called Blanc Ramé), Sélect, Montils, or Sémillon. Cognacs that are not to carry the name of a &quot;cru&quot; are freer in the allowed grape varieties, needing at least 90% Colombard, Folle blanche, Jurançon blanc, Meslier Saint-François, Montils, Sémillon, or Ugni blanc, and up to 10% Folignan or Sélect.

===Fermentation and distillation===

After the grapes are pressed, the juice is left to ferment for 2–3 weeks, with the region&#x27;s native wild yeast converting the fruit sugars into alcohol; neither sugar nor sulphur may be added. At this point, the resulting wine is about 7 to 8% alcohol.

Distillation takes place in traditionally shaped Charentais copper alembic stills, the design and dimensions of which are also legally controlled. Two distillations must be carried out; the resulting &quot;eau de vie&quot; is a colourless spirit of about 70% alcohol.

===Aging===
Once distillation is complete, it must be aged in Limousin oak casks for at least two years before it can be sold to the public. It is typically put into casks at an alcohol by volume strength around 70%. As the cognac interacts with the oak barrel and the air, it evaporates at the rate of about 3% each year, slowly losing both alcohol and water (the former more rapidly, as it is more volatile). This phenomenon is called locally &quot;la part des anges&quot;, or &quot;the angels&#x27; share&quot;. When more than ten years pass in the oak barrel, the cognac&#x27;s alcohol content decreases to 40% in volume. The cognac is then transferred to &quot;large glass bottles called bonbonnes&quot;, then stored for future &quot;blending.&quot; Since oak barrels stop contributing to flavor after four or five decades, longer aging periods may not be beneficial.

===Blending===
The age of the cognac is calculated as that of the youngest component used in the blend. The blend is usually of different ages and (in the case of the larger and more commercial producers) from different local areas. This blending, or &quot;marriage&quot;, of different &quot;eaux de vie&quot; is important to obtain a complexity of flavours absent from an &quot;eau de vie&quot; from a single distillery or vineyard. Each cognac house has a master taster (&quot;maître de chai&quot;), who is responsible for blending the spirits, so that cognac produced by a company will have a consistent house style and quality. In this respect, it is similar to the process of blending whisky or non-vintage Champagne to achieve a consistent brand flavor. A very small number of producers, such as Guillon Painturaud and Moyet, do not blend their final product from different ages of &quot;eaux de vie&quot;, so produce a &quot;purer&quot; flavour.
Hundreds of vineyards in the Cognac AOC region sell their own cognac. These are likewise blended from the &quot;eaux de vie&quot; of different years, but they are single-vineyard cognacs, varying slightly from year to year and according to the taste of the producer, hence lacking some of the predictability of the better-known commercial products. Depending on their success in marketing, small producers may sell a larger or smaller proportion of their product to individual buyers, wine dealers, bars and restaurants, the remainder being acquired by larger cognac houses for blending.

==Grades==


According to the Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (BNIC), the official quality grades of cognac are:

* V.S. (Very Special) or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been aged for at least two years in a cask.
* V.S.O.P. (Very Superior Old Pale) or Reserve designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is aged for at least four years in a cask.
* Napoléon designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is aged for at least six years. It is not to be confused with &quot;the Cognac of Napoleon&quot;, a sobriquet for Courvoisier.
*X.O. (Extra Old) The minimum age of the youngest brandy used in an X.O. blend was increased to 10 years in April 2018; this rule was originally scheduled for implementation in 2016, but was postponed due to inadequate stocks. The Napoleon designation, previously unofficial, is used to specifically denote those blends with a minimum age of six years that do not meet the revised X.O. definition.
* X.X.O. (Extra Extra Old) is a specific indication given to wine spirits that have been aged for at least 14 years.
* Hors d&#x27;âge (Beyond Age) is a designation which BNIC states is equal to X.O., but in practice the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.

Most names of the grades are in English because the historical cognac trade, particularly in the 18th century, significantly involved the British.

==Producing regions==

Cognac is also classified by &quot;crus&quot;, tightly defined geographic denominations where the grapes are grown. Their distinctive soils and microclimates produce &quot;eaux de vie&quot; with characteristics particular to their specific location.

* Grande Champagne () The soils in Grande Champagne and Petite Champagne are characterized as shallow clay-limestone, over limestone and chalk.
* Petite Champagne () &quot;Petite Champagne eaux de vie&quot; have similar characteristics to those from Grande Champagne. Cognacs made from a mixture of &quot;Grande&quot; and &quot;Petite Champagne eaux de vie&quot; (with at least 50% Grande Champagne) may be marketed as &quot;Fine Champagne&quot;.
* Borderies () The smallest &quot;cru&quot;. This denomination&#x27;s soil contains clay and flint stones resulting from the decomposition of limestone.
* Fins Bois () Heavier and faster aging &quot;eaux de vie&quot; ideal for establishing the base of some blended cognacs. The soils here are predominantly red clay-limestone and very stony, or otherwise heavy clay soils.
* Bons Bois and Bois Ordinaires (together ). Further out from the four central growth areas are these two growing regions. With a poorer soil and very much influenced by the maritime climate, this area is 20,000 hectares.
* Bois à terroirs The soils of Les Bois (Bons Bois, Bois Ordinaires, and Bois à terroirs) are sandy, spanning coastal areas and some valleys.

The cognac-producing regions called Champagne should not be confused with the northeastern region of Champagne, a wine region that produces sparkling wine by that name, although they do share a common etymology.

==Companies and brands==
Close to 200 cognac producers exist. According to one 2008 estimate a large percentage of cognac—more than 90% for the US market—comes from only four producers: Courvoisier (owned by the Campari Group), Hennessy (LVMH), Martell (Pernod Ricard), and Rémy Martin (Rémy Cointreau). Other brands meeting the AOC criteria for cognac include Bache-Gabrielsen/Dupuy, Braastad, Camus, La Fontaine de La Pouyade, Château Fontpinot, Delamain, Pierre Ferrand, Frapin, Gautier, Hine, Marcel Ragnaud, Monnet, Moyet, Otard, Meukow, and Cognac Croizet.

In 2017, an agreement between the European Union and Armenia was signed, whereby Armenian producers will abandon the usage of the protected geographic name &quot;cognac&quot; from 2043. The name &quot;cognac&quot; will be prohibited for the domestic Armenian market from 2032.

==Cognac-based cocktails==
Cocktails marked with &quot;IBA&quot; are designated as IBA official cocktails by the International Bartenders Association.
* Brandy Alexander: equal amounts of cognac, crème de cacao, and cream. (under the name Alexander)
* Between the Sheets: cognac, white rum, triple sec and fresh lemon juice. 
* French Connection: equal amounts of cognac and amaretto liqueur.
* Sazerac: cognac, absinthe, Peychaud&#x27;s Bitters, and a sugar cube. 
* Sidecar: traditionally made with cognac, an orange liqueur, and lemon juice.
* Stinger: cognac with a white crème de menthe.

==Cognac-based liqueurs==
*Chambord: a liqueur made from cognac infused with black and red raspberries and Madagascar vanilla
*Domaine de Canton: a cognac based ginger liqueur
*Grand Marnier: a liqueur made from cognac and distilled essence of bitter orange
*Pineau des Charentes: a sweet &quot;apéritif&quot;, composed of a cognac &quot;eau-de-vie&quot; and grape must, made in the Charente region

== In foods ==
In addition to being drunk as a beverage, cognac is also used as a flavoring in foods. Pastry dishes often pair cognac with flavors such as apple, raisin, prune, vanilla, and chocolate.

== The Role of the Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (BNIC) ==
&quot;The Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (BNIC) is a French organization that oversees the production, promotion, and protection of Cognac. The BNIC&#x27;s primary responsibilities include setting and enforcing the standards for Cognac production, ensuring the authenticity and quality of the product, and promoting the brand on a global scale.&quot;

<text>Switzerland is a federal republic in Europe. It is one of the most developed countries in the world, with the highest nominal wealth per adult and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product according to the IMF. Switzerland ranks at or near the top globally in several metrics of national performance, including government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic competitiveness, and human development. 

Switzerland&#x27;s most important economic sector is manufacturing. Manufacturing consists largely of the production of specialist chemicals, health and pharmaceutical goods, scientific and precision measuring instruments and musical instruments. The largest exported goods are chemicals (34% of exported goods), machines/electronics (20.9%), and precision instruments/watches (16.9%). Exported services amount to a third of exports. The service sector – especially banking and insurance, tourism, and international organisations – is another important industry for Switzerland.

<doc id="84493" wikidata="Q83813" url="?curid=84493" title="Savannah, Georgia">
<text>Savannah ( ) is the oldest city in the U.S. state of Georgia and the county seat of Chatham County. Established in 1733 on the Savannah River, the city of Savannah became the British colonial capital of the Province of Georgia and later the first state capital of Georgia. A strategic port city in the American Revolution and during the American Civil War, Savannah is today an industrial center and an important Atlantic seaport. It is Georgia&#x27;s fifth-most-populous city, with a 2020 U.S. census population of 147,780. The Savannah metropolitan area, Georgia&#x27;s third-largest, had a 2020 population of 404,798.

Savannah attracts millions of visitors each year to its cobblestone streets, parks, and notable historic buildings. These include the birthplace of Juliette Gordon Low (founder of the Girl Scouts of the USA), the Georgia Historical Society (the oldest continually operating historical society in the South), the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences (one of the South&#x27;s first public museums), the First African Baptist Church (one of the oldest African-American Baptist congregations in the United States), Temple Mickve Israel (the third-oldest synagogue in the U.S.), and the Central of Georgia Railway roundhouse complex (the oldest standing antebellum rail facility in the U.S. and now a museum and visitor center).

Savannah&#x27;s downtown area, which includes the Savannah Historic District, its 22 parklike squares, and the Savannah Victorian Historic District, is one of the largest National Historic Landmark Districts in the United States (designated by the federal government in 1966). Downtown Savannah largely retains the founder James Oglethorpe&#x27;s original town plan, a design known as the Oglethorpe Plan. During the 1996 Summer Olympics hosted by Atlanta, Savannah held sailing competitions in the nearby Wassaw Sound.

==History==


On February 12, 1733, General James Oglethorpe and settlers from the ship &quot;Anne&quot; landed at Yamacraw Bluff and were greeted by Tomochichi, the Yamacraws, and Indian traders John and Mary Musgrove. Mary Musgrove often served as an interpreter. The city of Savannah and the colony of Georgia were founded on that date. In 1751, Savannah and the rest of Georgia became a Royal Colony, with Savannah as its capital.

By the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Savannah had become the southernmost commercial port in the Thirteen Colonies. British troops took the city in 1778, and the following year, a combined force of American and French soldiers, including Haitians, failed to rout the British at the Siege of Savannah. The British did not leave the city until July 1782. In December 1804 the state legislature declared Milledgeville the new capital of Georgia.

Savannah, a prosperous seaport throughout the nineteenth century, was the Confederacy&#x27;s sixth most populous city and the prime objective of General William T. Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea. On December 21, 1864, local authorities negotiated a peaceful surrender to save Savannah from destruction, and Union troops marched into the city at dawn.

Savannah was named after the Savannah River, which probably derives from variant names for the Shawnee, a Native American people who migrated to the river in the 1680s. The Shawnee destroyed another Native people, the Westo, and occupied their lands at the head of the Savannah River&#x27;s navigation on the fall line, near present-day Augusta. These Shawnee, whose Native name was &quot;Ša·wano·ki&quot; (literally, &quot;southerners&quot;), were known by several local variants, including Shawano, Savano, Savana and Savannah. Another theory is that the name Savannah refers to the extensive marshlands surrounding the river for miles inland, and is derived from the English term &quot;savanna&quot;, a kind of tropical grassland, which was borrowed by the English from Spanish &quot;sabana&quot; and used in the Southern Colonies. (The Spanish word comes from the Taino word &quot;zabana&quot;.) Still other theories suggest that the name Savannah originates from Algonquian terms meaning not only &quot;southerners&quot; but perhaps also &quot;salt&quot;.

==Geography==
Savannah lies on the Savannah River, approximately upriver from the Atlantic Ocean. According to the United States Census Bureau (2011), the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water (5.15%). Savannah is the primary port on the Savannah River and the largest port in Georgia. It is also near the U.S. Intracoastal Waterway. Georgia&#x27;s Ogeechee River flows toward the Atlantic Ocean some south of downtown Savannah and forms the southern city limit.

Savannah is prone to flooding due to abundant rainfall, an elevation just above sea level, and the shape of the coastline, which poses a greater surge risk during hurricanes. The city currently uses five canals. In addition, several pumping stations have been built to help reduce the effects of flash flooding.

===Climate===
Savannah&#x27;s climate is classified as humid subtropical (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;). Throughout the Deep South, this is characterized by long and almost tropical summers and short, mild winters. Savannah records only a few days of freezing temperatures each year, and snowfall is rare. Due to its proximity to the Atlantic coast, Savannah rarely experiences temperatures as extreme as those in Georgia&#x27;s interior. Nevertheless, the extreme temperatures have officially ranged from , on July 20, 1986, and July 12, 1879, down to during the January 1985 Arctic outbreak.

Seasonally, Savannah tends to have hot and humid summers with frequent (but brief) thunderstorms that develop in the warm and tropical air masses, which are common. Although summers in Savannah are frequently sunny, half of Savannah&#x27;s annual precipitation falls from June through September. Average dewpoints in summer range from . Winters in Savannah are mild and sunny with average daily high temperatures of in January. November and December are the driest months recorded at Savannah–Hilton Head International Airport. Each year, Savannah reports 21 days on average with low temperatures below freezing, though in some years, fewer than 10 nights will fall below freezing, and the city has even gone an entire winter season (1879–80) without recording a freeze. Although decades might pass between snowfall events, Savannah has experienced snow on rare occasions, most notably in December 1989, when up to was recorded in one day in parts of the city.

Savannah is at risk for hurricanes, particularly of the Cape Verde type of storms that take place during the peak of the season. Because of its location in the Georgia Bight (the arc of the Atlantic coastline in Georgia and northern Florida) as well as the tendency for hurricanes to re-curve up the coast, Savannah has a lower risk of hurricanes than some other coastal cities such as Charleston, South Carolina. Savannah was seldom affected by hurricanes during the 20th century. Hurricane David, in August 1979, is a notable exception. However, the historical record shows that the city was frequently affected during the second half of the 19th century. The most prominent of these storms was the 1893 Sea Islands hurricane, which killed at least 2,000 people. (This estimate may be low, as deaths among the many impoverished rural African Americans living on Georgia&#x27;s barrier islands may not have been reported.)

Savannah was most recently affected by an active 2016 hurricane season, including Hurricane Matthew (which made a partial eyewall landfall), and was brushed by Hurricane Irma in 2017. The 2024 season saw impacts from Hurricane Debby and Hurricane Helene.

The first meteorological observations in Savannah probably occurred at Oglethorpe Barracks circa 1827, continuing intermittently until 1850 and resuming in 1866. The Signal Service began observations in 1874, and the National Weather Service has kept records of most data continually since then; since 1948, Savannah-Hilton Head International Airport has served as Savannah&#x27;s official meteorological station. Annual records (dating back to 1950) from the airport&#x27;s weather station are available on the web.

===Cityscape===
====Neighborhoods====

Savannah is a city of diverse neighborhoods. More than 100 distinct neighborhoods can be identified in six principal areas of the city: Downtown (Landmark Historic District and Victorian District), Midtown, Southside, Eastside, Westside, and Southwest/West Chatham (recently annexed suburban neighborhoods).

The total number of violent crimes in the Savannah-Chatham County reporting area ran just above 1,000 per year from 2003 through 2006. In 2007, however, the total number of violent crimes jumped to 1,163. Savannah-Chatham has recorded between 20 and 25 homicides each year since 2005.

In 2007, Savannah-Chatham recorded a sharp increase in home burglaries but a sharp decrease in thefts from parked automobiles. During the same year, statistics show a 29 percent increase in arrests for Part 1 crimes. An additional increase in burglaries occurred in 2008 with 2,429 residential burglaries reported to Savannah-Chatham police that year. That reflects an increase of 668 incidents from 2007. In 2007, there were 1,761 burglaries, according to metro police data. Savannah-Chatham police report that crimes reported in 2009 came in down 6 percent from 2008.

In 2009, 11,782 crimes were reported to metro police — 753 fewer than in 2008. Within 2009, there was a 12.2 percent decrease in violent crimes compared with 2008. Property crimes saw a 5.3 percent decline, which included a 5.2 percent reduction in residential burglary. In 2008, residential burglary was up by almost 40 percent. While some violent crimes increased in 2009, crimes like street robbery went down significantly. In 2009, 30 homicides were reported, four more than the year before. Also, 46 rapes were reported, nine more than the year before. In the meantime, street robbery decreased by 23 percent. In 2008, metro police achieved a 90 percent clearance rate for homicide cases, described as exceptional by violent crime unit supervisors. In 2009, the department had a clearance rate of 53 percent, which police attributed to outstanding warrants and grand jury presentations.

The SCMPD provides the public with up-to-date crime report information through an online mapping service. The year of 2015 saw a dramatic increase in the number of violent crimes, including at least 54 deaths due to gun violence, a number not seen since the early 1990s. The first quarter of 2018 saw crime trending downward, compared to 2017.

=== Religion ===

Before British colonization of the Americas and the founding of colonial Georgia, the coastal region&#x27;s indigenous inhabitants practiced Native American religions. Since colonization, the city of Savannah and the surrounding area have remained predominantly Christian. However, a Jewish community has lived in Savannah since the colony&#x27;s first year. Later, Gullah-Geechee culture and Hoodoo practices were also observed, often alongside Christianity.

Founded in 1733, with the establishment of the Georgia colony, Christ Church is the longest continuous Christian congregation in Georgia. Early rectors include the Methodist evangelists John Wesley and George Whitefield. Christ Church continues as an active congregation located on its original site on Johnson Square. The Independent Presbyterian Church, which was founded in 1755, has represented the community&#x27;s Presbyterian constituency. Other historically prominent churches have included: the First Bryan Baptist Church, an African American church that was organized by Andrew Bryan in 1788; First African Baptist Church; and St. Benedict the Moor Church, which was the first African American Catholic church in Georgia, and one of the oldest in the Southeast.

The oldest standing house of worship is First Baptist Church (1833), located on Chippewa Square. Other historic houses of worship in Savannah include: the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, the Episcopal St. John&#x27;s Church, and Temple Mickve Israel (the third-oldest synagogue in the U.S.).

According to the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2020, the largest Christian group overall were Protestants within the Baptist tradition, served by the Southern Baptist Convention, National Baptist Convention, National Missionary Baptist Convention, and Progressive National Baptist Convention. Non-denominational Protestants represented the second-largest Christian group, including the Christian churches and Churches of Christ. Methodists were the third-largest, spread among the United Methodist Church and African Methodist Episcopal Church. The single second-largest Christian denomination was the Roman Catholic Church, served by the Diocese of Savannah.

Among Savannah&#x27;s non-Christian population, which forms a minority, Hinduism was the city&#x27;s second-largest religion. Judaism was Savannah&#x27;s third-largest, with a history dating back to 1733. Orthodox Judaism, Reform Judaism, and Conservative Judaism were the predominant Jewish traditions adhered to. Islam was the area&#x27;s fourth-largest religion, followed by the Baha&#x27;i.

==Economy==

Agriculture was essential to Savannah&#x27;s economy during its first two centuries. Silk and indigo production, both in demand in England, were early export commodities. By 1767, almost a ton of silk per year was exported to England. Georgia&#x27;s mild climate offered perfect conditions for growing cotton, which became the dominant commodity after the American Revolution. Its production under the plantation system and shipment through the Port of Savannah helped the city&#x27;s European immigrants achieve wealth and prosperity.

By the nineteenth century, the Port of Savannah had become one of the most active in the United States. In the United States&#x27; early years, goods produced in the New World had to pass through Atlantic ports such as Savannah&#x27;s before they could be shipped to England. The Port of Savannah grew to become North America&#x27;s fourth-largest port for shipping container traffic. In 2023, the port handled 4.9 million twenty-foot equivalent container units (TEU).

Savannah&#x27;s first hotel, City Hotel, was completed in 1821. It also housed the city&#x27;s first United States Post Office branch. Between 1912 and 1968, the Savannah Machine &amp; Foundry Company was a shipbuilder in Savannah.

For years, Savannah was the home of Union Camp, which housed the world&#x27;s largest paper mill. The plant is now owned by International Paper and remains one of Savannah&#x27;s largest employers. Savannah is also home to the Gulfstream Aerospace company, maker of private jets, and various other significant industrial interests. TitleMax is headquartered in Savannah. Morris Multimedia, a newspaper and television company based in Savannah.

In 2000, JCB, the third-largest producer of construction equipment in the world and the leading manufacturer of backhoes and telescopic handlers, built its North American headquarters near Savannah in Pooler on I-95 near Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport. By 2023, Naturals2Go relocated to Savannah, and Amazon has operated throughout Savannah and its metropolitan area since 2021.

===Culture===


Savannah&#x27;s architecture, history, and reputation for Southern charm and hospitality are internationally known. The city&#x27;s former promotional name was the &quot;Hostess City of the South&quot;, which the city government still uses. An earlier nickname was &quot;the Forest City&quot;, in reference to the large population of live oak trees that flourish in the Savannah area. These trees were especially valuable in shipbuilding during the 19th century. In 2019, Savannah attracted 14.8 million tourists from across the country and around the world. Savannah&#x27;s downtown area is one of the largest National Historic Landmark districts in the United States.

The city&#x27;s location offers visitors access to the coastal islands and the Savannah Riverfront, both popular tourist destinations. Tybee Island (officially named Savannah Beach from 1929 until 1978) is a beach community and the site of the historic Tybee Island Light Station, the first lighthouse on the southern Atlantic coast. Other picturesque towns adjacent to Savannah include the shrimping village of Thunderbolt and three residential areas that began as summer resort communities for Savannahians: Beaulieu, Vernonburg, and the Isle of Hope.

The Savannah Convention Center is located on Hutchinson Island, which lies across from downtown Savannah and is surrounded by the Savannah River. The Savannah Belles Ferry connects the island with the mainland, as does the Talmadge Memorial Bridge.

The Georgia Historical Society is an independent educational and research institution with a research center in Savannah. The center&#x27;s library and archives hold the oldest materials related to Georgia&#x27;s history.

The Savannah Civic Center on Montgomery Street hosts more than nine hundred events annually.

Savannah has consistently been named one of &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Cities&quot; by &quot;&quot;Travel + Leisure&quot;.&quot; In 2012, the magazine rated Savannah highest in &quot;Quality of Life and Visitor Experience&quot;. Savannah was also ranked first for &quot;Public Parks and Outdoor Access&quot;, visiting in the Fall, and as a romantic escape. Savannah was also named as America&#x27;s second-best city for &quot;Cool Buildings and Architecture&quot;, behind only Chicago.

The mile-long Jones Street, in Savannah&#x27;s Historic District, has been described as one of the most charming streets in the United States.

===Squares===

Savannah is noted for its 22 squares and small parks along five historic streets running north to south. Each street has between three and five squares. The squares vary in size and character, from the formal fountain and monuments of the largest, Johnson, to the playgrounds of the smallest, Crawford. Elbert, Ellis, and Liberty Squares are classified as the three &quot;lost squares&quot; destroyed in the course of urban development during the 1950s. Elbert and Liberty Squares were paved over to make way for a realignment of U.S. Route 17, while Ellis Square was demolished to build the City Market parking garage. The city restored Ellis Square after razing the parking garage. The garage was rebuilt as an underground facility, the Whitaker Street Parking Garage, and opened in January 2009. The restored Ellis Square opened in March 2010. Separate efforts are now underway to revive Elbert and Liberty Squares.

Franklin Square is the site of Savannah&#x27;s Haitian Monument, which commemorates the heroic efforts of the Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint-Domingue in the 1779 Siege of Savannah and for an independent America. One of the few black regiments to fight for the American side in the Revolutionary War, the soldiers were recruited from present-day Haiti, which was the French colony of Saint-Domingue until its independence in 1804. Chippewa Square honors the Battle of Chippawa during the War of 1812. It features a large statue of James Oglethorpe, the city&#x27;s founder. In popular culture, the square is the location of the park bench seen in the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; from which the title character dispenses wisdom to others waiting for a bus.

Because both Calhoun Square (the official name until 2022) and Whitefield Square were named for prominent slaveholders, a movement was begun in 2021 to rename them Sankofa Square and Jubilee Square, respectively. Calhoun Square was renamed Taylor Square in 2024.

===Historic homes===

Among the historic homes that have been preserved are: the Olde Pink House, the Sorrel–Weed House, Juliette Gordon Low&#x27;s birthplace, the Davenport House Museum, the Green–Meldrim House, the Owens–Thomas House, the William Scarbrough House, and the Wormsloe plantation of Noble Jones. Mercer Williams House, the former home of Jim Williams in Monterey Square, is the main location of &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;.

Opulent buildings that succumbed to fire include the mansions at Bonaventure Plantation and Greenwich Plantation.

===Historic cemeteries===
Colonial Park Cemetery was the city&#x27;s principal burial ground for much of the eighteenth century when Georgia was a British colony. Laurel Grove Cemetery, with the graves of many Confederate soldiers and enslaved African Americans, was Savannah&#x27;s chief municipal cemetery during the nineteenth century. Bonaventure Cemetery is a former plantation and the final resting place for some illustrious Savannahians. Also located in Savannah are the Mordecai Sheftall Cemetery and the Levi Sheftall Family Cemetery, which both date back to the second half of the eighteenth century.

===Historic forts===
Fort Jackson (named for the Georgia politician James Jackson, not Andrew Jackson) lies on the Savannah River, one mile east of Savannah&#x27;s Historic District. Built between 1808 and 1812 to protect the city from attack by sea, it was one of several Confederate forts defending Savannah from Union forces during the Civil War. Fort Pulaski National Monument, located on Cockspur Island, east of Savannah, preserves the largest fort protecting the city during the war. The Union Army bombarded Fort Pulaski in April 1862 with the aid of a new rifled cannon. Confederate troops soon surrendered, and the cannon rendered all brick fortifications obsolete.

<text>Real Zaragoza, S.A.D. (), commonly referred to as Zaragoza, is a football club based in Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain, that currently competes in the Segunda División, the second tier of the Spanish league system. Zaragoza holds its home games at La Romareda.

Founded on 18 March 1932, the club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga, although they have not played at that level since they were last relegated in 2013. They have won the Copa del Rey six times, 1963–64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the 1994–95 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, amongst other trophies. Traditionally, their team colours are white shirts and socks with royal blue shorts.

A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support Real Zaragoza, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.

The club&#x27;s main rivals are: SD Huesca, their opponents in the Aragonese derby; CD Numancia, from the nearby Province of Soria; and CA Osasuna, the largest club in the neighbouring Navarre region.

==History==

===Early years===
Real Zaragoza was originally formed from two rival teams: &quot;Iberia SC&quot; and &quot;Real Zaragoza CD&quot;. In 1939, after three years without football due to the Spanish Civil War, the team made its first appearance in La Liga, ending in 7th position out of 12 teams, but being relegated in 1941. The club returned to the top division one year later, only to be immediately relegated back. It remained in Segunda División until the end of the 1950–51 campaign, when it achieved promotion by finishing second in a play-off league.

On 8 September 1957, the team left its original stadium, El Torrero, for its current stadium, La Romareda.

===The golden era===
Beginning in the 1960–61 season, Zaragoza enjoyed a period of great success, showcasing some of the greatest players playing in Spain during that decade, which earned for themselves the designation of &quot;Los Magníficos&quot;. While the team failed to capture the league title, it finished in the top five every year until 1968–69, with two third-place finishes, and also won its first two Copa del Rey titles and the 1963–64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.

Zaragoza&#x27;s famous attacking line included Canário, Carlos Lapetra, Marcelino, Eleuterio Santos and Juan Manuel Villa. The Peruvian Juan Seminario, who started his career in Spain with &quot;Los Maños&quot; before moving to Barcelona, won the Pichichi Trophy in the 1961–62 campaign, scoring 25 goals in 30 matches as Zaragoza finished in fourth position.

===1970s to the end of the century===

Zaragoza finished third in 1973–74 and a best-ever second in the following season, losing the title in the last round to Real Madrid. The club was also defeated 0–1 in the 1976 domestic cup final against Atlético Madrid, spending two seasons in the second level during the decade, with promotion at the first attempt on either occasion.

In 1986, Zaragoza won its third Copa del Rey, defeating Barcelona 1–0. The club finished the 1990–91 season in 17th position, thus having to appear in the promotion/relegation play-offs against Real Murcia; on 19 June 1991, after a 0–0 away draw, a 5–2 home win meant the team managed to maintain its top level status.

Víctor Fernández was appointed manager in 1991. On 10 May 1995, one year after winning the Copa del Rey against Celta de Vigo, Zaragoza won the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup against Arsenal at the Parc des Princes, Paris, after having disposed of the likes of Feyenoord and Chelsea &quot;en route&quot;. With the score level at 1–1, the two teams entered extra time and, in the 120th minute, Nayim hit a half-volley from just past the halfway line, putting it beyond the reach of goalkeeper David Seaman for the final 2–1. The club then contested the 1995 UEFA Super Cup against Ajax, losing 1–5 on aggregate despite a home draw in the first leg. Víctor Fernández was dismissed from his post in early November 1996, after only winning one league match that season.

===The 21st century===
The 2000s brought a further two Copa del Rey titles to Zaragoza&#x27;s trophy cabinet, including the 2003–04 edition against Real Madrid in Barcelona (3–2 after extra time). However, the club also suffered top flight relegation in 2002 after narrowly avoiding so the previous season, but achieved immediate promotion in 2003. In late May 2006, Agapito Iglesias purchased Alfonso Solans&#x27; shares and took control of the club, promising to build one of the strongest teams in Spain and Europe. In his first year in charge, he purchased Pablo Aimar from Valencia for €11 million, and former manager Víctor Fernández also returned to the club.

Mainly due to Diego Milito&#x27;s 23 goals in 2006–07 (he finished third to Roma&#x27;s Francesco Totti and Real Madrid&#x27;s Ruud van Nistelrooy – 26 and 25 goals, respectively – in the European Golden Shoe race), Real Zaragoza finished in sixth position, thus qualifying to the UEFA Cup. However, the following season ended in relegation (18th position among 20 teams with only 10 wins in 38 matches, among them only 1 away win in 19 games) – for the second time in the decade – with the side also being eliminated in the first round in European competition. Legendary club coach Víctor Fernández returned for a second spell, although he was sacked in January 2008, as the club had four managers during the campaign. On the last matchday, a brace from Ricardo Oliveira proved insufficient in a 2–3 away loss against Mallorca, with the team totalling 42 points to Osasuna&#x27;s 43.

Zaragoza achieved promotion from the second division at the first attempt. On the last matchday, on 20 June 2009, the team drew 2–2 at Rayo Vallecano with goals from youth graduate David Generelo and ex-Real Madrid defender Francisco Pavón, only trailing champions Xerez in the table. Nevertheless, that season Zaragoza was the best team at home, gained 50 from their 81 points in home games. However, after four seasons mainly spent in the bottom half of the table, Zaragoza was relegated following the 2012–13 Liga season after finishing last.

In April 2022, the purchase of 51% of the shares of the SAD by an international investment fund led by Jorge Mas was disclosed.

<text>In Greek mythology, Dascylus or Daskylos () is a name that may refer to:

*Dascylus, a king who ruled over Mysia or Mariandyne. He is presumably the eponym of the coastal city of Dascylaeum or Dascylium (but see below). The wife of Dascylus was Anthemoeisia, daughter of the river god Lycus, and he was the father of sons named Lycus, Priolas, and Otreus. Dascylus&#x27; own father was the infamous Tantalus. Priolas and Otreus were both killed by Amycus, king of Bebrycia (Bithynia); Otreus was killed while travelling to Troy to sue for the hand of King Laomedon&#x27;s daughter Hesione in marriage. Both sons have names connected with local settlements: Priola, near Heraclea, and Otrea, on the Ascanian Lake.
*Dascylus, a son of Lycus, and grandson of the above Dascylus. He acted as a guide to the Argonauts.
*Dascylus of Lydia (fl. late 8th to early 7th century BC), named by Herodotus as the father of Gyges.
*Dascylus, father of Nacolus. His son was the eponym of the city of Nacoleia in Phrygia.
*Dascylus, son of Periaudes, eponym of Dascylium, a town in Caria.

The myth is not known from any extant Greek sources, but it is found in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; 5.648-661

: Now the youth [i.e. Triptolemus] was carried high over Europe and Asia. He turned his face towards Scythia where Lyncus was king. He stood before the king&#x27;s household gods. He was asked how he had come there, and the reason for his journey, his name, and his country. He said &#x27;Athens, the famous city, is my home, Triptolemus, my name. I came not by ship, on the sea, or by foot, overland. The clear air parted for me. I bring you the gifts of Ceres. If you scatter them through the wide fields, they will give you back fruitful harvests, and ripening crops.&#x27; The barbarian was jealous. So that he might be the author, of so great a gift, he received him like a guest, but attacked Triptolemus, with a sword, while he was in deep sleep. As he attempted to pierce the youth&#x27;s breast, Ceres turned the king into a lynx, then ordered the youth Athenian to drive the sacred yoke back through the air.

<text>The Bebryces () were a tribe of people who lived in Bithynia. According to Strabo they were one of the many Thracian tribes that had crossed from Europe into Asia, although modern scholars have rather argued for a Celtic origin.

== Name ==
Classical linguists considered the name of Bebryces related to the thracian tribe Bryges, which was later renamed to Phryges (Phrygians), based on the geographic proximity, as well as the migration route of the Phrygians known from ancient myths.

B. Sergent suggests that the name &quot;Bebryces&quot; could be related to the Celtic tribes &quot;Bebruces&quot;, living in the Pyrenees, and &quot;Briboci&quot;, dwelling in Britain, all ultimately stemming from Proto-Celtic &quot;*brebu&quot; (&#x27;beaver&#x27;; see Gaulish &quot;bebros&quot;, &quot;bebrus&quot;, Old Irish &quot;Bibar&quot;, &#x27;beaver&#x27;). Ivan Duridanov also suggested that the ethnonym was related to Indo-European words meaning &quot;beaver&quot;.

The same word denotes beaver in Slavic Languages (*&quot;bebrus&quot; in Proto-Balto-Slavic, &quot;bober&quot; in Slovenian, &quot;bobar&quot; in Bulgarian, &quot;bobr&quot; in Russian).

== History ==
According to legend they were defeated by Heracles or the Dioscuri, who killed their king, Mygdon or Amycus. Their land was then given to King Lycus of the Mariandynians, who built the city Heraclea there. Some say Amycus was a brother of Mygdon and another Bebrycian king; both were sons of Poseidon and Melia. Greek mythology offers two different accounts for the origin of the name &#x27;Bebryces&#x27;: either from a woman named Bebryce (Eustath. ad Dionysius Periegetes 805.), or from a hero named Bebryx (or Bebrycus) (Steph. Byz. s.v. Bebrycus). Bebryce is possibly the same as Bryce, a daughter of Danaus, a mythical King of Libya and Arabia (Apollodorus). Bebryx was also the father of Pyrene.

<text>St. Petersburg is a city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 258,308, making it the fifth-most populous city in Florida and the most populous city in the state that is not a county seat (the city of Clearwater is the seat of Pinellas County). It is the second-most populous city in the Tampa Bay area, which is the second-largest metropolitan area in Florida with an estimated population of about 3.29 million in 2022.

St. Petersburg is located on the Pinellas peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, and is connected to mainland Florida to the north. Locals often refer to the city as &quot;St. Pete&quot;. Neighboring St. Pete Beach formally shortened its name in 1994 after a vote by its residents. St. Petersburg is governed by a mayor and city council.

With an average of 361 days of sunshine annually, and a Guinness World Record for the most consecutive days of sunshine (768 days between 1967 and 1969), it is nicknamed &quot;The Sunshine City.&quot; Located on the Gulf of Mexico, the average water temperature is typically around . Due to its good weather, the city has long been a popular retirement destination, although in recent years the population has moved in a much more youthful direction.

==History==

===Early Spanish exploration===
When the Spanish first arrived in the area of Tampa Bay, they encountered people of the Safety Harbor culture. About 20 sites with temple mounds have been found around Tampa Bay, with several in Pinellas County. Best known of the Safety Harbor people was the chiefdom of Tocobaga, which was likely located at the Safety Harbor site in Philippe Park in northern Pinellas County. The Pánfilo de Narváez expedition landed on the shores of Boca Ciega Bay at the Jungle Prada Site on April 14, 1528. It was the first inland exploration of North America. Of 300 men on the expedition only four survived. One of the survivors of the expedition, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, wrote the first book describing the peoples, wildlife, flora and fauna of inland North America in his &quot;Relacion&quot;, published in Spain in 1542.

===19th century===
The city was co-founded by John C. Williams, formerly of Detroit, who purchased the land in 1875, and by Peter Demens, who was instrumental in bringing the terminus of the Orange Belt Railway there in 1888. St. Petersburg was incorporated as a town on February 29, 1892, when it had a population of 300 people.

Local lore claims John C. Williams and Peter Demens flipped a coin to see who would have the honor of naming the city. When Demens won the coin toss, the city was named after Saint Petersburg, Russia, where Peter Demens had spent half of his youth, while John C. Williams named the first hotel after his birthplace, Detroit (a hotel built by Demens). The Detroit Hotel still exists downtown on Central Ave, but has been turned into a condominium.

The oldest operating hotels are the Pier Hotel (formally Hotel Cordova), built in 1921, and The Exchange Hotel (formally The Heritage Hotel), built in 1926.

The first major newspaper to debut in Tampa Bay was the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; which established in 1884. Philadelphia publisher F. A. Davis turned on St. Petersburg&#x27;s first electrical service in 1897. The city&#x27;s first major industry was born in 1899 when Henry W. Hibbs (1862–1942), a native of Newport, North Carolina, established his wholesale fish business at the end of the railroad pier, which extended out to the shipping channel. Within a year, Hibbs Fish Company was shipping more than of fish each day.

=== 20th century ===
St. Petersburg was incorporated as a city in June 1903. With this transition, the development of the downtown waterfront had dredging of a deeper shipping channel from 1906 to 1908 which opened St. Petersburg to larger shipping. Further dredging improved the port facilities through the 1910s. By then the city&#x27;s population had quadrupled to a population of 4,127 citizens. F. A. Davis was instrumental to bringing the first trolley service in 1904.


In 1914, Al Lang invited the St. Louis Browns to move their spring training into the city, then worked tirelessly to make Grapefruit League training in and around St. Petersburg the destination for baseball teams and their fans by the 1920s. Lang eventually became mayor and ambassador for the city, and helped its permanent population grow tenfold in just a decade.

In 1914 an airplane service across Tampa Bay from St. Petersburg to Tampa and back was initiated, generally considered the first scheduled commercial airline flight. The flight took former mayor Abe Pheil to Tampa. The company name was the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, and the pilot was Tony Jannus flying a Benoist XIV flying boat. The Tony Jannus Award is presented annually for outstanding achievement in the airline industry.

St. Petersburg&#x27;s first library opened on December 1, 1915, which still operates to this day as the Mirror Lake Library.

The city and its tourism industry burgeoned in the 1920s, with up to a quarter million visitors annually coming from Canada, the North and the Midwest by automobile, yacht, and railroad. The city was the principal Gulf Coast destination for long-distance trains of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Southland&quot; (from Chicago and Cincinnati) and &quot;Gulf Coast Limited&quot; (from New York, succeeded by the &quot;West Coast Champion&quot;), and Seaboard Air Line Railroad trains such as the &quot;Southern States Special&quot; (from New York, succeeded by the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;). Travel time from across the bay was cut due to the Gandy Bridge&#x27;s opening in 1924, allowing direct access to Tampa and the rest of central Florida.

The city took on a Mediterranean flair, with Old Spanish Trail style architecture promoted by Snell Isle founder Perry Snell, whose new country club island homes adopted many elements of Moorish design. Those same elements were echoed in the city&#x27;s new Vinoy, Jungle Country Club, Don Cesar and other fine hotels, as well as in Snell&#x27;s new skyscraper office building downtown. The 1926 opening of the Million Dollar Pier marked the peak of the boom, adding an attraction that brought both tourists and townspeople together to enjoy fishing, amusements, trolley access and even a local radio station.

The St. Petersburg flag was created in 1927 and was designed by Mayor C.J. Maurer along with a committee of other public officials. It featured an array of colors symbolic of St. Pete&#x27;s culture including the sunshine, water and land. The idea came after officials called for a new logo which later became the design for the flag. The pelican featured in the center became a symbol for the &quot;Feed the Pelican Fund&quot; which has supported the birds during the winter months.

Tourism declined by the late 1920s and early 1930s due to the Great Depression. The city recovered later in the 1930s with the help of the Public Works Administration, including a $10 million investment plan in 1939 which helped build the St. Petersburg City Hall. The second World War brought renewed growth, as the city&#x27;s Bayboro Harbor became a training base for the U.S. Coast Guard and the Army Air Force chose the city as their technical service training station. The hotels filled for the first time in years, as up to 100,000 troops came to St. Petersburg. After the war, many of those troops who were stationed in St. Petersburg returned as residents or tourists.

In the 1950s, St. Petersburg experienced another population boom, with the return of retiree resettlement to the city. In 1954 the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge opened its first span to link St. Petersburg with Manatee County, connecting the next year to U.S. Route 19 in the city. With a large influx of car traffic, it was decided to remove the city&#x27;s streetcar lines.

From 1955 to 1959, Black residents led concerted swim-ins of the segregated Spa Beach &amp; Spa pool. The St. Petersburg government continually fought this, closing the beach repeatedly and arresting protesters. This continued up to &amp; after the &quot;Alsup v. St. Petersburg&quot; ruling in April 1957 that St. Petersburg could not segregate the beach or pool. After continued pressure from residents through swim-in&#x27;s, on January 6, 1959, the government officially reopened them as an integrated beach and pool.The development of major transportation continued into the 1960s with the completion of the Howard Frankland Bridge in 1960, creating another connection between St. Petersburg and Tampa. St. Petersburg also received its first stadium named the Bayfront Center which hosted the first professional hockey league in Tampa Bay. A new municipal marina and the Museum of Fine Arts were also built downtown. St. Petersburg is home to one of the world&#x27;s largest reclaimed water systems that was built in the 1970s which flows 37 million gallons of water per day to provide for customers located throughout the city.
From May to August 1968, 211 city&#x27;s sanitation workers struck in the city for higher wages. The strike began approximately one month after Martin Luther King, Jr.&#x27;s assassination in Memphis, Tennessee while supporting that city&#x27;s sanitation workers strike.

In 1984, a full-scale flying replica of the Benoist XIV flying boat was constructed by Florida Aviation Historical Society for the 70th anniversary of the flight. This aircraft is now on loan to the St. Petersburg Museum of History in St. Petersburg, Florida.

=== Contemporary history ===

Development of the first Major League Baseball team to be located in the Tampa Bay area began in St. Petersburg throughout the 1970s. The city tried to encourage numerous teams through the United States to make St. Petersburg their new home. Designs for a ballpark were first presented in 1983 and construction for a permanent dome stadium began in 1986. This process controversially required the demolition of the mostly-Black Gas Plant neighborhood. The stadium opened in 1990 as the Florida Suncoast Dome, renamed the Thunderdome in 1993. After many attempts to attract tenants to the new stadium, Major League Baseball gave St. Petersburg a franchise in 1995. In 1996, the dome was renamed a third time to Tropicana Field after naming rights were established with Tropicana Dole Beverages. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays was then established in 1998 after the stadium&#x27;s renovation and the new team played their first game on March 31, 1998, giving the Tampa Bay area their first professional baseball team.

I-275 was expanded across the bay from Tampa through St. Petersburg in the 1970s. Additional spurs I-175 and I-375 were built afterward, extending from the main highway to the northern and southern edges of the downtown area. The city population continued to multiply during the 20th century, booming through the 1970s as a popular retirement destination for Americans from midwestern cities, reaching 238,647 in the 1980 census. Racial tensions persisted, and the city was rocked by the 1996 riots, sparked by the shooting of a black teenager by a white St. Pete police officer. Growth stagnated in the subsequent decade and a half, but since the Great Recession, renewed interest in urban living by family aged residents and the expansion of the downtown university and related services has renewed its growth.

==Geography==

===Topography===

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land, and of it (55.13%) is water. St. Petersburg is bordered by Tampa Bay&#x27;s three sections, Old, Middle and Lower Tampa Bay.

===Downtown===

Downtown St. Petersburg is the Central Business District, containing high rises for office use. The &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; newspaper is headquartered in the downtown area. The Poynter Institute, which owns the paper, is located on 3rd Street South.

The Mahaffey Theater complex, the Morean Arts Center, dozens of other art galleries, The Coliseum, Palladium Theatre, and Jannus Live are among the galleries and cultural venues featured downtown. Several prominent museums are located in the perimeter. Many of them have received notable accolades, including the Chihuly Collection presented by the Morean Arts Center, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Salvador Dalí Museum, the now-closed Florida International Museum, the St. Petersburg Museum of History, Florida Holocaust Museum, and the James Museum of Western and Wildlife Art. The city hosts many outdoor festivals throughout the year.

St. Petersburg&#x27;s downtown has been rated among the best in the South, with many waterfront parks and attractions. The area&#x27;s gulf beaches are a drive from downtown, and are connected with downtown by the SunRunner Bus Rapid Transit line. 

Jutting a half mile into the bay is the St. Petersburg Pier, a major tourist attraction that offers various activities. &quot;The Lens&quot; design which was chosen by the International Design Competition Jury and accepted by City Council later had its contract terminated by a citywide election during the summer of 2013. Following this, the &quot;Pier Park&quot; was chosen out of the 16 new design teams that submitted work in late 2014 and in 2015 the Pier Park was set for construction in early 2017. The new Pier District opened on July 6, 2020, and contains green space, the Marketplace, playground, splash pad, and several public art installations, including Janet Echelman&#x27;s aerial net sculpture, &quot;Bending Art&quot;.

Downtown also contains the University of South Florida St. Petersburg and a downtown branch of St. Petersburg College. The downtown perimeter includes several parks, most of which are waterfront or lakefront. Straub Park is nearly a half mile long, boasts a waterfront location, and is home of the St. Petersburg Museum of Fine Arts. Because of the number of parks in the downtown area, The Trust for Public Land ranks St. Petersburg 1st in Florida and 15th out of 100 of the largest cities in the U.S. The Vinoy Park Hotel has a bayfront location, a spot on the National Register of Historic Places, and an AAA Four-Diamond rating. It fronts Vinoy Park, which holds music festivals, including the Warped Tour. Nearby is the historic Tramor Cafeteria building, now part of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;. The city is connected via the Looper Trolley.

Many dining and nightlife locations can be found downtown on or near Central Avenue extending to 34th Street in the west or Beach Drive along the waterfront. Venues include Jannus Live and the State Theatre. The active nightlife scene is credited to recent demographic and regulatory changes. In 2010, the city council voted to extend bar hours until 3 A.M., identical to cross-bay &quot;rival&quot; Tampa.

Tropicana Field, home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Tampa Bay Rays, is located in the western part of downtown. Until 2008, the team played its spring training games at nearby Progress Energy Park. This setup was unique, making St. Petersburg the first city that played host to its baseball team during spring training as well as the regular season since the 1919 Philadelphia Athletics. At the end of 2007, there was a debate over a new stadium to be built on the downtown waterfront at the current Progress Energy Park site. Tropicana Field would be demolished and replaced with prime residential and retail space. Completion of the stadium was planned for 2012; however, the proposal was tabled indefinitely while a community-based organization investigates all alternatives for new stadium construction. In 2022, the Rays organization and the city came to an agreement over redevelopment; the Trop will be demolished by 2027, to be replaced by a new stadium and a restored Gas Plant neighborhood surrounding it.
St. Petersburg has the third-largest dedicated public waterfront park system in North America, with a waterfront park system that stretches and is used year-round for public events, festivals and other activities. In the early 20th century, citizens and city leaders engaged in a long and boisterous debate over the future of the young city&#x27;s waterfront space, with one side advocating for commercial, port and industrial development and the other side advocating for a long-term commitment to parks and public access to the waterfront. The public access and park contingent won the debate when, on Christmas Eve 1909, the city announced the acquisition of the waterfront land that is encompassed by the waterfront park system.

The city is also becoming one of the largest destinations in Florida for kiteboarding with locations such as Fort De Soto Park, Pass-a-Grille, and Ten-Cent.

The St. Petersburg Shuffleboard Club was established in 1924 and gained attention as the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Shuffleboard Club&quot; with 110 courts and over 5,000 members in the 1950s and 1960s.

Northshore Aquatic Complex is a public pool and small water park located downtown on the St. Petersburg waterfront. Northshore contains a 50-meter pool with diving board, 25 meter training pool with zero depth entry, a play pool, and is home to both Saint Petersburg Aquatics swim club and Saint Petersburg Masters swim club.

===Cityscape===

===Neighborhoods===
St. Petersburg is home to more than 100 neighborhoods, with most of the historic districts located near the bay. On the central Eastern edge of the city is Downtown St. Petersburg, which includes the city&#x27;s residential and commercial skyscrapers, art galleries, museums, and parks.

The downtown area is home to the central business district and to many start-up companies, corporate branches, banks, law firms, and restaurants. Apart from downtown&#x27;s business and cultural offerings, the area also includes a branch of St. Petersburg College and the campus of the University of South Florida-St. Petersburg. The downtown district is home to two professional sports teams, the Tampa Bay Rays, which play in the western part of downtown at Tropicana Field, and the Tampa Bay Rowdies, which play along the downtown waterfront at Al Lang Stadium. The emerging Edge district on the western edge of downtown is rapidly growing as development spreads down Central Avenue.

North of downtown lie the Historic Old Northeast and Snell Isle, which both have Mediterranean style historic and waterfront homes, parks, and recreational areas. Old Northeast is home to a shopping district, city landmarks, beaches, and small shops as well as small residential high rises. Snell Isle was founded by C. Perry Snell who bought up the land to develop upscale properties in the 1900s, and helped create some of St. Petersburg&#x27;s resorts such as the Vinoy Park Hotel and the St. Petersburg Woman&#x27;s Club, both of which are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The far north consists of the Gateway area which overlaps part of Pinellas Park, home to major employers such as Home Shopping Network and currently the site of much construction of residential and business buildings and of new toll roads.

The central portion of St. Petersburg includes the Grand Central District and Historic Kenwood. The Grand Central District houses many of the city&#x27;s cafes, art galleries, restaurants, and bars all owing to the Craftsman style architecture. Historic Kenwood is filled with art studios and galleries similarly to the Grand Central District.

South of downtown is Historic Roser Park, which houses historic Mediterranean and Eclectic style housing, parks, and museums. The neighborhood is divided by Booker Creek which flows into Bayboro Harbor.

In far western St. Petersburg, north of the separate city of South Pasadena, Florida, is the neighborhood of Pasadena, which includes the intersection of State Road 693 (Pasadena Avenue) and County Road 150 (Central Avenue).

===Climate===

St. Petersburg has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) with some characteristics of a tropical monsoon climate (Am), with a defined rainy season from June through September. Many portions of St. Petersburg, especially along the bay and in south St. Petersburg, have tropical microclimates due to the maritime influence of the Gulf of Mexico and Tampa Bay.

==Sports==

The Tampa-St. Petersburg area is represented by teams in four major professional sports (soccer, football, baseball, and hockey). Two teams, the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball and Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League, play in St. Petersburg proper, while the other two teams play across the bay in Tampa. As their names suggest, all of the teams represent the entire Tampa Bay area and seek to draw fans from both sides of Tampa Bay.

The Tampa-St. Petersburg area hosted the Super Bowl LV, where the Tampa Bay Buccaneers took on the Kansas City Chiefs at Raymond James Stadium on February 7, 2021.

The Rays began play in 1998, finishing last in the American League&#x27;s East Division in nine of the first ten seasons they played, including their last year known as the &quot;Devil Rays&quot;: 2007. In 2008, their 11th season, they held off the Boston Red Sox and won the AL East Division Championship for the first time. In the playoffs, they again faced the Red Sox in the ALCS. They defeated Boston and won the American League Pennant. However, they lost to the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2008 World Series. The Rays also made an appearance in the 2020 World Series where they faced the Los Angeles Dodgers.

From their inception until 2008, the Rays played their regular season games at Tropicana Field and their spring training games at historic Al Lang Stadium, formerly Progress Energy Park, giving them the unique distinction of being the only team in Major League Baseball that played its spring training games in their home city in more than 70 years. Beginning in 2009, the Rays have held spring training at Charlotte Sports Park in Port Charlotte, ending a 94-year streak of springtime baseball in the city. Tropicana Field, the home venue of the Rays, played host to the 1999 Final Four. Despite not having a team in the city since 2000 (with the St. Petersburg Devil Rays), St. Petersburg is home to Minor League Baseball&#x27;s main headquarters. Due to the damage on Tropicana Field caused by Hurricane Milton, the Rays spent the 2025 season at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa. 

St. Petersburg is home to the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, the inaugural race was held in April 2005. The circuit itself is made of downtown streets passing Al Lang Stadium, the marina, and a runway in Albert Whitted Airport, and streets are temporarily blocked off for the annual Indy Racing League&#x27;s IndyCar Series race. The race was postponed in 2020 due to the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, and was rescheduled as the final race of the season, rather than the first race. In 2012, the road intersecting Turn 10 was renamed Dan Wheldon Way in memory of Dan Wheldon, who won the 2005 race thanks to a move made on that turn. Wheldon was killed in an accident at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway in the 2011 season finale.

The Tampa Bay Rowdies of the United Soccer League began play in Tampa in 2010 and moved to Al Lang Stadium in 2011. The long-time baseball venue is named after Al Lang, a former mayor of St. Petersburg who was instrumental in bringing spring training to the city in 1914. The Rowdies initially shared Al Lang Stadium with various amateur baseball events, but eventually took over operation of the facility and has converted it into a soccer-only facility The Rowdies&#x27; ownership has expressed interest in moving up to join Major League Soccer (MLS) and a 2016 referendum gave the club permission to build a larger privately funded stadium at the site of Al Lang Stadium if the move takes place.

The Bay Area Pelicans Rugby Football Club has made their home in St. Petersburg since 1977.

The legislative body consists of eight City Council members representing each of their designated city districts.

St. Petersburg is split between Florida&#x27;s 13th congressional district, represented in Congress by Republican Anna Paulina Luna, and Florida&#x27;s 14th congressional district, represented by Democrat Kathy Castor. The city is much more left-leaning than the surrounding county- in 2020, 62.3% percent of voters in St. Pete&#x27;s metro city boundaries cast their ballots for Democratic candidate Joe Biden.

==Art and culture==

St. Petersburg is considered one of the significant art centers and markets in Florida, featuring several art districts, museums, commercial galleries, public artworks, and annual art festivals.

The Warehouse Arts District emerged circa 2009 alongside a significant glass art market that has become known as &quot;the Glass Coast&quot;. The &quot;Deuces Live District&quot; is home to the city of St. Petersburg&#x27;s African American cultural heritage, and includes locally owned art galleries and other specialty businesses, as well as historic buildings such as the Royal Theater. The &quot;M.L. King North District&quot; includes restaurants and cafes. 

St. Petersburg also features more than 600 public art murals, which are the focus of the city’s annual SHINE Mural Festival.

It is also served by Interstates 175 and 375, which branch off I-275 into the southern and northern areas of downtown respectively. The Gandy Bridge, conceived by George Gandy and opened in 1924, was the first causeway to be built across Tampa Bay, connecting St. Petersburg and Tampa cities without a circuitous trip around the bay through Oldsmar.

====Airports====
Nearby Tampa International Airport (TPA) provides air transportation for many passengers. Historically, smaller airlines with service to smaller cities and towns have operated at St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport, with a number of air carriers only providing only seasonal services. The exception at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport (PIE) is Allegiant Air which currently operates Airbus A319 and A320 mainline jetliners into the airfield with year-round nonstop service from many cities in the eastern U.S. Albert Whitted Airport provides general aviation services near the heart of downtown St. Petersburg.

In 2022, PSTA launched the SunRunner, a bus rapid transit service connecting downtown St. Petersburg to St. Pete Beach. The SunRunner is the first bus rapid transit line in the Tampa Bay Area and is expected to spur economic development along the Central Avenue corridor in Pinellas County. In its first weekend alone, the SunRunner had over 10,000 passengers. Ridership continues to be steady; however, PSTA hiked fares, citing a homelessness issue.

<text>The was the feudal military government of Japan during the Kamakura period from 1185 to 1333. 

The Kamakura shogunate was established by Minamoto no Yoritomo after victory in the Genpei War and appointing himself as &quot;shōgun&quot;. Yoritomo governed Japan as military dictator from the eastern city of Kamakura with the emperor of Japan and his Imperial Court in the official capital city of Heian-kyō (Kyoto) as figureheads. The Kamakura &quot;shōguns&quot; were members of the Minamoto clan until 1226, the Fujiwara clan until 1252, and the last six were minor princes of the imperial family. The Hōjō clan were the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of Japan as &quot;shikken&quot; (regent) of the &quot;shōgun&quot; from 1203. The Kamakura shogunate saw the Jōkyū War in 1221 and the Mongol invasions of Japan under Kublai Khan in 1274 and 1281. The Kamakura shogunate was overthrown in the Kenmu Restoration under Emperor Go-Daigo in 1333, re-establishing Imperial rule until Ashikaga Takauji and his offspring overthrew the imperial government and founded the Ashikaga shogunate in 1336 (Nanboku-chō period).

There are various theories as to the year in which the Kamakura period and Kamakura shogunate began. In the past, the most popular theory was that the year was 1192, when Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed . Later, the prevailing theory was that the year was 1185, when Yoritomo established the , which controlled military and police power in various regions, and the , which was in charge of tax collection and land administration. Japanese history textbooks as of 2016 do not specify a year for the beginning of the Kamakura period, as there are various theories about the year the Kamakura shogunate was established.

==History==
===Establishment===
Historically in Japan, the power of civilian government was primarily held by the ruling emperor of Japan and their regents, typically appointed from the ranks of the Imperial Court and the aristocratic clans that vied for influence there. Military affairs were handled under the auspices of the civil government. 

From 1180 to 1185, the Genpei War was fought between the Taira and Minamoto clans as part of a longstanding violent rivalry for influence over the Emperor and his court. Minamoto no Yoritomo defeated the Taira clan, but in his victory seized power from the civil aristocracy, politically relegating the Emperor and his court to symbolic figureheads. In 1192, Yoritomo and the Minamoto clan established a military government in Kamakura.

===The Hōjō Regency===

Yoritomo unexpectedly died in an accident in 1199, leaving the Minamoto clan weakened. Hōjō Tokimasa, the father of Yoritomo&#x27;s widow, Hōjō Masako, and former guardian and protector of Yoritomo, claimed the title of regent (shikken) to Yoritomo&#x27;s son Minamoto no Yoriie, eventually making that claim hereditary to the Hōjō clan. At the same time, Hōjō Masako maneuvered herself into such a powerful, albeit informal, position that people began calling her the &quot;nun shogun&quot; in the place of her son Yoriie. As Minamoto no Yoriie grew older, however, he attempted to exert real power, resulting in a power struggle with the Hōjō clan of his own mother. These conflicts caused considerable tensions within the shogunate. In 1201, the Jo clan unsuccessfully attempted to overthrow the Minamoto clan in the Kennin Rebellion. Eventually, Tokimasa deposed Yoriie, backed up his younger brother, Minamoto no Sanetomo, as a new shōgun, and assumed the post of shikken. Sanetomo was only twelve at this point, and accordingly power factually rested with his mother Hōjō Masako. The Minamoto remained the titular shōguns, with the Hōjō holding the real power. In 1204, loyalists of Yoriie attempted an uprising to topple the Hōjō domination, but the latter defeated the rebels and assassinated Yoriie.

In 1205, Hōjō Tokimasa attempted to depose Sanetomo, hoping to install his son-in-law as new shogun. However, his daughter Hōjō Masako saw this as threat to her own status; she arranged the pretender&#x27;s murder and banished her father to a monastery. In 1219, Sanetomo was assassinated by his nephew Kugyō. Since Sanetomo died childless, the line of shōguns from the Minamoto clan ended with him. From this point onwards, the Hōjō were in total control. With Sanetomo&#x27;s death in 1219, his mother Hōjō Masako continued to serve as the shogunate&#x27;s real center of power. As long as she lived, regents and shōguns would come and go, while she stayed at the helm. Since the Hōjō family did not have the rank to nominate a shōgun from among its members, Masako had to find a convenient puppet. The problem was solved by choosing Kujo Yoritsune, a distant relation of the Minamoto, who would be the fourth shōgun and figurehead, while Hōjō Yoshitoki would take care of day-to-day business. However powerless, future shōguns would always be chosen from either Fujiwara or imperial lineage to keep the bloodline pure and give legitimacy to the rule. This succession proceeded for more than a century.

As a result, the Kamakura shogunate rested on an unusual pyramid of regents and &quot;de facto&quot; usurpation: The true rulers, namely the Hōjō regents, had usurped power from the Minamoto, who had usurped it from the Emperor, descending from Emperor Kōkō, who usurped it from the children of Emperor Seiwa. At the same time, the regents, shoguns, and emperors all still maintained their nominal positions and existed alongside each other. The regime nonetheless proved to be stable enough to last a total of 135 years, 9 shōguns and 16 regents.

In 1221, Emperor Go-Toba tried to regain power in what would be called the , but the attempt failed. The power of the Hōjō remained unchallenged until 1324, when Emperor Go-Daigo orchestrated a plot to overthrow them, but the plot was discovered almost immediately and foiled.

===Mongol invasions===
The Mongols under Kublai Khan attempted sea-borne invasions in 1274 and 1281.
Fifty years before, the shogunate had agreed to Korean demands that the Wokou be dealt with to stop their raids, and this bit of good diplomacy had created a cooperative relationship between the two states, such that the Koreans, helpless with a Mongol occupation army garrisoning their country, had sent much intelligence information to Japan, so that along with messages from Japanese spies in the Korean peninsula, the shogunate had a good picture of the situation of the pending Mongol invasion. The shogunate had rejected Kublai&#x27;s demands to submit with contempt. The Mongol landings of 1274 met with some success, however there was no rout of the Japanese defenders, who in any case greatly outnumbered the 40,000 combined invasion force of Mongols and Korean conscripts. Noting an impending storm, the Korean admirals advised the Mongols to re-embark so that the fleet could be protected away from shore; however, the typhoon was so destructive that one-third of the Mongol force was destroyed.

After the surviving forces returned to Mongol territory, Kublai was not dissuaded from his intentions of bringing Japan under Mongol control, and once again sent a message demanding submission, which infuriated the Hōjō leadership, who had the messengers executed. They responded with decisive action for defense—a wall was built to protect the hinterland of Hakata Bay, defensive posts were established, garrison lists were drawn up, regular manning of the home provinces was redirected to the western defenses, and ships were constructed to harass the invaders&#x27; fleet when they appeared.

The Mongols returned in 1281 with a force of some 50,000 Mongol-Korean-Chinese along with some 100,000 conscripts from the defeated Song empire in south China. This force embarked and fought the Japanese for some seven weeks at several locations in Kyushu, but the defenders held, and the Mongols made no strategic headway. Again, a typhoon approached, and the Koreans and Chinese re-embarked the combined Mongol invasion forces in an attempt to deal with the storm in the open sea. At least one-third of the Mongol force was destroyed, and perhaps half of the conscripted Song forces to the south over a two-day period of August 15–16. Thousands of invading troops were not able to embark in time and were slaughtered by the samurai. Such losses in men, material, and the exhaustion of the Korean state in provisioning the two invasions put an end to the Mongols&#x27; attempts to conquer Japan. The &quot;divine wind&quot;, or &quot;kamikaze&quot;, was credited for saving Japan from foreign invasion.

For two further decades the Kamakura shogunate maintained a watch in case the Mongols attempted another invasion. However, the strain on the military and the financial expenditures weakened the regime considerably. Additionally, the defensive war left no gains to distribute to the warriors who had fought it, leading to discontent. Construction of defensive walls added further expenses to the strained regime.

===Decline and fall===
In 1331, Emperor Go-Daigo took arms against Kamakura, but was defeated by Kamakura&#x27;s Ashikaga Takauji and exiled to Oki Island, in today&#x27;s Shimane Prefecture. A warlord then went to the exiled emperor&#x27;s rescue, and in response the Hōjō sent forces again commanded by Takauji to attack Kyoto. Once there, however, Takauji decided to switch sides and support Go-Daigo. At the same time another warlord loyal to the emperor, Nitta Yoshisada, attacked Kamakura and took it. About 870 Hōjō clan, including the last three Regents, committed suicide at their family temple, Tōshō-ji, whose ruins were found in today&#x27;s Ōmachi.

In 1336, Ashikaga Takauji assumed the position of shōgun himself, establishing the Ashikaga shogunate.

==Institutions==
The Kamakura shogunate functioned within the framework of the Heian system of Imperial rule.

Yoritomo established a chancellery, or &quot;mandokoro&quot;, as his principal organ of government. Later, under the Hōjō, a separate institution, the &quot;hyōjōshū&quot; became the focus of government.

The shogunate appointed new military governors (&quot;shugo&quot;) over the provinces/states. These were selected mostly from powerful families in the different provinces, or the title was bestowed upon a general and his family after a successful campaign. Although they managed their own affairs, in theory they were still obliged to the central government through their allegiance to the shōgun. The military governors paralleled the existing system of governors and vice-governors (&quot;kokushi&quot;) appointed by the civil government in Kyoto.

Kamakura also appointed stewards, or &quot;jitō&quot;, to positions in the manors (&quot;shōen&quot;). These stewards received revenues from the manors in return for their military service. They served along with the holders of similar office, &quot;gesu&quot;, who delivered dues from the manor to the proprietor in Kyoto. Thus the dual governmental system reached to the manor level.

In legal matters, the government promulgated a legal code called Goseibai Shikimoku in 1232 which would continuously be used until the Muromachi period. A court of appeals was also set up during this period, called the Moncho-jo.

<text>The , also known as the , was the feudal military government of Japan during the Muromachi period from 1336 to 1573.

The Ashikaga shogunate was established when Ashikaga Takauji was appointed &quot;Shōgun&quot; after overthrowing the Kenmu Restoration shortly after it had overthrown the Kamakura shogunate in support of Emperor Go-Daigo. The Ashikaga clan governed Japan from the Imperial capital of Heian-kyō (Kyoto) as &quot;de facto&quot; military dictators along with the &quot;daimyō&quot; lords of the &quot;samurai&quot; class. The Ashikaga shogunate began the Nanboku-chō period between the Pro-Ashikaga Northern Court in Kyoto and the Pro-Go-Daigo Southern Court in Yoshino until the South conceded to the North in 1392. The Ashikaga shogunate collapsed upon outbreak of the Ōnin War in 1467, entering a state of constant civil war known as the Sengoku period, and was finally dissolved when &quot;Shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshiaki was overthrown by Oda Nobunaga in 1573.

The Ashikaga shogunate&#x27;s alternative name &quot;Muromachi&quot; and the Muromachi period are derived from the Muromachi district of Kyoto, where the third &quot;Shōgun&quot;, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, established his residence nicknamed the on Muromachi Street in 1379.

== Background and early period ==
From 1180 to 1185, the Genpei War was fought between the Taira and Minamoto clans, which had a longstanding violent rivalry for influence over the Emperor of Japan and his Imperial Court. The Genpei War ended with victory for the Minamoto under Minamoto no Yoritomo, establishing the Kamakura shogunate after being pronounced &quot;Shōgun&quot; and beginning the Kamakura period. The Hōjō clan rose to power and governed Japan from the city of Kamakura, while the Emperor and his Imperial Court remained in the official capital city of Heian-kyō as largely symbolic figures. The Hōjō monopoly of power, as well as the lack of a reward of lands after the defeat of the Mongol invasions, led to simmering resentment among Hōjō vassals.

In 1333, the Emperor Go-Daigo ordered local governing vassals to oppose Hōjō rule, in favor of Imperial rule in the Kenmu Restoration. The Kamakura shogunate ordered Ashikaga Takauji to squash the uprising, but for reasons that are unclear, Takauji turned against Kamakura and fought on behalf of the Imperial court, successfully overthrowing the shogunate. It is possibly because Takauji was the unofficial leader of the powerless Minamoto clan while the Hōjō clan were from the Taira clan the Minamoto had previously defeated. Japan was returned to Imperial civilian rule, but Emperor Go-Daigo&#x27;s policies were unpopular and failed to satisfy those who had fought for him. In 1336, Takauji established his own military government in Kyoto, effectively overthrowing the Kenmu Restoration and appointing himself as the new &quot;Shōgun&quot;.

== Northern and Southern Courts ==

After Ashikaga Takauji established himself as the &quot;Shōgun&quot;, a dispute arose with Emperor Go-Daigo on the subject of how to govern the country. That dispute led Takauji to cause Prince Yutahito, the second son of Emperor Go-Fushimi, to be installed as Emperor Kōmyō while Go-Daigō fled Kyoto. Japan was subsequently divided between two Imperial courts: the Northern Court located in Kyoto, in favor of Kōmyō under Ashikaga influence; and the Southern Court located in Yoshino, in favor of Go-Daigō. The Northern and Southern courts engaged in an ideological struggle for power that continued for 56 years, until the Southern Court gave up during the reign of &quot;Shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshimitsu in 1392.

== Government structure ==
The Ashikaga shogunate was the weakest of the three Japanese military governments. Unlike its predecessor, the Kamakura shogunate, or its successor, the Tokugawa shogunate, when Ashikaga Takauji established his government he had little personal territory with which to support his rule. The Ashikaga shogunate was thus heavily reliant on the prestige and personal authority of its &quot;shōgun&quot;. The centralized master-vassal system used in the Kamakura system was replaced with the highly de-centralized &quot;daimyōs&quot; (local lord) system, and because of the lack of direct territories, the military power of the &quot;shōgun&quot; depended heavily on the loyalty of the &quot;daimyō&quot;.

On the other hand, the Imperial court was no longer a credible threat to military rule. The failure of the Kenmu Restoration had rendered the court weak and subservient, a situation that Ashikaga Takauji reinforced by establishing his court within close proximity to the Emperor in Kyoto. The authority of the local &quot;daimyō&quot; greatly expanded from that of Kamakura times. In addition to military and policing responsibilities, the shogunate-appointed &quot;shugo&quot; now absorbed the judicial, economic, and taxation powers of the local Imperial governors, while the government holdings in each province were rapidly absorbed into the personal holdings of the &quot;daimyō&quot; or their vassals. The loss of both political clout and an economic base deprived the Imperial court of much of its power, which were then assumed by the Ashikaga &quot;shōgun&quot;. This situation reached its peak under the rule of the third &quot;shōgun&quot;, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu.

After Yoshimitsu however, the structural weakness of the Ashikaga shogunate was exposed by numerous succession troubles and early deaths. This became dramatically more acute after the Ōnin War, after which the shogunate itself became reduced to little more than a local political force in Kyoto.

===Foreign relations===
The Ashikaga shogunate&#x27;s foreign relations policy choices were played out in evolving contacts with Joseon on the Korean Peninsula and with imperial China.

== Fall of the shogunate ==
Bloody succession crises amongst the warrior families led to a decline in the authority of the bakufu until it almost vanished by 1441 at the death of Ashikaga Yoshinori. The lack of government control was especially acute when the &quot;daimyō&quot; feuded among themselves in the pursuit of power during the Ōnin War (1467–1477), until it erupted into open warfare in the late Muromachi period, also known as the Sengoku period.

When the &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshiteru was assassinated in 1565, an ambitious &quot;daimyō&quot;, Oda Nobunaga, seized the opportunity and installed Yoshiteru&#x27;s brother Ashikaga Yoshiaki as the 15th Ashikaga &quot;shōgun&quot; and Nobunaga&#x27;s puppet. However Yoshiaki was not entirely subservient to Nobunaga: he continued to strike bargains amongst the monasteries to gain favor, and mediated between powerful clans such as the Otomo and Mori. The Ashikaga shogunate was finally destroyed in 1573 when Nobunaga drove Yoshiaki out of Kyoto. Initially, Yoshiaki fled to Shikoku. Afterwards, he sought and received protection from the Mōri clan in western Japan.

The Ashikaga family survived the 16th century, and a branch of it became the &quot;daimyō&quot; family of the Kitsuregawa domain.

== Palace remains ==

The shogunal residence, also known as the &quot;Flower Palace&quot;, was in Kyoto on the block now bounded by Karasuma Street (to the east), Imadegawa Street (to the south), Muromachi Street (to the west, giving the name), and Kamidachiuri Street (to the north). The location is commemorated by a stone marker at the southwest corner, and the of Dōshisha University contains relics and excavations of the area.

<text>The Tokugawa shogunate, also known as the was the military government of Japan during the Edo period from 1603 to 1868.

The Tokugawa shogunate was established by Tokugawa Ieyasu after victory at the Battle of Sekigahara, ending the civil wars of the Sengoku period following the collapse of the Ashikaga shogunate. Ieyasu became the &quot;shōgun,&quot; and the Tokugawa clan governed Japan from Edo Castle in the eastern city of Edo (Tokyo) along with the &quot;daimyō&quot; lords of the &quot;samurai&quot; class. The Tokugawa shogunate organized Japanese society under the strict Tokugawa class system and banned most foreigners under the isolationist policies of &quot;Sakoku&quot; to promote political stability. The Tokugawa shoguns governed Japan in a feudal system, with each &quot;daimyō&quot; administering a &quot;han&quot; (feudal domain), although the country was still nominally organized as imperial provinces. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, Japan experienced rapid economic growth and urbanization, which led to the rise of the merchant class and &quot;Ukiyo&quot; culture.

The Tokugawa shogunate declined during the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; period from 1853 and was overthrown by supporters of the Imperial Court in the Meiji Restoration in 1868. The Empire of Japan was established under the Meiji government, and Tokugawa loyalists continued to fight in the Boshin War until the defeat of the Republic of Ezo at the Battle of Hakodate in June 1869.

==History==

Following the Sengoku period (&quot;Warring States period&quot;), the central government had been largely re-established by Oda Nobunaga during the Azuchi–Momoyama period. After the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, central authority fell to Tokugawa Ieyasu. While many &quot;daimyos&quot; who fought against him were extinguished or had their holdings reduced, Ieyasu was committed to retaining the &quot;daimyos&quot; and the &quot;han&quot; (domains) as components under his new shogunate. &quot;Daimyos&quot; who sided with Ieyasu were rewarded, and some of Ieyasu&#x27;s former vassals were made &quot;daimyos&quot; and were located strategically throughout the country. The &quot;sankin-kotai&quot; policy, in an effort to constrain rebellions by the daimyos, mandated the housing of wives and children of the &quot;daimyos&quot; in the capital as hostages.

In 1616, there was a failed attempt of the invasion of Taiwan by a Shogunate subject named Murayama Tōan.

A long period of peace occurred between the Siege of Osaka in 1615 and the Keian Uprising in 1651. This period saw the bakufu prioritise civil administration, while civil society witnessed a surge in trade and industrial activities. Trade under the reign of Ieyasu saw much new wealth created by mining and goods manufacturing, which resulted in a rural population flow to urban areas. By the Genroku period (1688–1704) Japan saw a period of material prosperity and the blossoming of the arts, such as the early development of &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; by Moronobu. The reign of Tokugawa Yoshimune (1716–1745) saw poor harvests and a fall in tax revenue in the early 1720s, as a result he pushed for the Kyoho reforms to repair the finances of the bakufu as he believed the military aristocracy was losing its power against the rich merchants and landowners.

Society in the Tokugawa period, unlike in previous shogunates, was supposedly based on the strict class hierarchy originally established by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The &quot;daimyō&quot; (lords) were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of samurai, with the farmers, artisans, and traders ranking below. In some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, &quot;daimyō,&quot; and samurai were more or less identical, since &quot;daimyō&quot; might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local rulers.

The largely inflexible nature of this social stratification system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the peasantry were set at fixed amounts that did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners increasingly declined over time. A 2017 study found that peasant rebellions and desertion lowered tax rates and inhibited state growth in the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, both the &quot;shogun&quot; and &quot;daimyos&quot; were hampered by financial difficulties, whereas more wealth flowed to the merchant class. Peasant uprisings and samurai discontent became increasingly prevalent. Some reforms were enacted to attend to these issues such as the Kansei reform (1787–1793) by Matsudaira Sadanobu. He bolstered the bakufu&#x27;s rice stockpiles and mandated &quot;daimyos&quot; to follow suit. He cut down urban spending, allocated reserves for potential famines, and urged city-dwelling peasants to return to rural areas.

By 1800, Japan included five cities with over 100,000 residents, and three among the world&#x27;s twenty cities that had more than 300,000 inhabitants. Edo likely claimed the title of the world&#x27;s most populous city, housing over one million people.

=== Christians under the Shogunate ===
Followers of Catholic Christians first began appearing in Japan during the 16th century. Oda Nobunaga embraced Christianity and the Western technology that was imported with it, such as the musket. He also saw it as a tool he could use to suppress Buddhist forces.

Though Christianity was allowed to grow until the 1610s, Tokugawa Ieyasu soon began to see it as a growing threat to the stability of the shogunate. As &quot;Ōgosho&quot; (&quot;Cloistered &quot;Shōgun&quot;&quot;), he influenced the implementation of laws that banned the practice of Christianity. His successors followed suit, compounding upon Ieyasu&#x27;s laws. The ban of Christianity is often linked with the creation of the Seclusion laws, or Sakoku, in the 1630s.

=== Late Tokugawa shogunate (1853–1867) ===
The late Tokugawa shogunate ( &quot;Bakumatsu&quot;) was the period between 1853 and 1867, during which Japan ended its isolationist foreign policy called &quot;sakoku&quot; and modernized from a feudal shogunate to the Meiji government. The 1850s saw growing resentment by the &quot;tozama daimyōs&quot; and anti-Western sentiment following the arrival of a U.S. Navy fleet under the command of Matthew C. Perry (which led to the forced opening of Japan). The major ideological and political factions during this period were divided into the pro-imperialist &quot;Ishin Shishi&quot; (nationalist patriots) and the shogunate forces; aside from the dominant two groups, other factions attempted to use the chaos of the Bakumatsu era to seize personal power.

An alliance of &quot;daimyos&quot; and the emperor succeeded in overthrowing the shogunate, which came to an official end in 1868 with the resignation of the 15th Tokugawa shogun&quot;,&quot; Tokugawa Yoshinobu, leading to the &quot;restoration&quot; (王政復古, &quot;Ōsei fukko&quot;) of imperial rule. Some loyal retainers of the shogun continued to fight during the Boshin War that followed but were eventually defeated in the notable Battle of Toba–Fushimi.

==Government==

===Shogunate and domains===

The &quot;bakuhan&quot; system (&quot;bakuhan taisei&quot; ) was the feudal political system in the Edo period of Japan. &quot;Baku&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;bakufu&quot;, meaning &quot;military government&quot;—that is, the shogunate. The &quot;han&quot; were the domains headed by &quot;daimyō&quot;. Beginning from Ieyasu&#x27;s appointment as shogun in 1603, but especially after the Tokugawa victory in Osaka in 1615, various policies were implemented to assert the shogunate&#x27;s control, which severely curtailed the &quot;daimyos&quot;&#x27; independence. The number of &quot;daimyos&quot; varied but stabilized at around 270.

The &quot;bakuhan&quot; system split feudal power between the shogunate in Edo and the &quot;daimyōs&quot; with domains throughout Japan. The &quot;shōgun&quot; and lords were all &quot;daimyōs&quot;: feudal lords with their own bureaucracies, policies, and territories. Provinces had a degree of sovereignty and were allowed an independent administration of the &quot;han&quot; in exchange for loyalty to the &quot;shōgun&quot;, who was responsible for foreign relations, national security, coinage, weights, measures, and transportation.

The &quot;shōgun&quot; also administered the most powerful &quot;han&quot;, the hereditary fief of the House of Tokugawa, which also included many gold and silver mines. Towards the end of the shogunate, the Tokugawa clan held around 7 million &quot;koku&quot; of land (天領 tenryō), including 2.6–2.7 million &quot;koku&quot; held by direct vassals, out of 30 million in the country. The other 23 million &quot;koku&quot; were held by other daimyos.

The number of &quot;han&quot; (roughly 270) fluctuated throughout the Edo period. They were ranked by size, which was measured as the number of &quot;koku&quot; of rice that the domain produced each year. One &quot;koku&quot; was the amount of rice necessary to feed one adult male for one year. The minimum number for a &quot;daimyō&quot; was ten thousand &quot;koku&quot;; the largest, apart from the &quot;shōgun&quot;, was more than a million &quot;koku&quot;.

==== Policies to control the daimyos ====
The main policies of the shogunate on the &quot;daimyos&quot; included:

* The principle was that each &quot;daimyo&quot; (including those who were previously independent of the Tokugawa family) submitted to the shogunate, and each &quot;han&quot; required the shogunate&#x27;s recognition and was subject to its land redistributions. &quot;Daimyos&quot; swore allegiance to each shogun and acknowledged the Laws for Warrior Houses or &quot;buke shohatto&quot;.
* The &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; (参勤交代 &quot;alternate attendance&quot;) system, required &quot;daimyos&quot; to travel to and reside in Edo every other year, and for their families to remain in Edo during their absence.
* The &quot;ikkoku ichijyō rei&quot; (一国一城令), allowed each daimyo&#x27;s &quot;han&quot; to retain only one fortification, at the &quot;daimyo&#x27;s&quot; residence.
* The Laws for the Military Houses (武家諸法度, &quot;buke shohatto&quot;), the first of which is 1615 forbade the building of new fortifications or repairing existing ones without &quot;bakufu&quot; approval, admitting fugitives of the shogunate, and arranging marriages of the daimyos&#x27; families without official permission. Additional rules on the samurai were issued over the years.

Although the shogun issued certain laws, such as the &quot;buke shohatto&quot; on the &quot;daimyōs&quot; and the rest of the samurai class, each &quot;han&quot; administered its autonomous system of laws and taxation. The &quot;shōgun&quot; did not interfere in a &quot;han&quot;&#x27;s governance unless major incompetence (such as large rebellions) was shown, nor were central taxes issued. Instead, each &quot;han&quot; provided feudal duties, such as maintaining roads and official courier stations, building canals and harbors, providing troops, and relieving famines. &quot;Daimyōs&quot; were strategically placed to check each other, and the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system ensured that &quot;daimyōs&quot; or their family were always in Edo, observed by the shogun.
The shogunate had the power to discard, annex, and transform domains, although they were rarely and carefully exercised after the early years of the shogunate, to prevent &quot;daimyōs&quot; from banding together. The &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system of alternative residence required each &quot;daimyō&quot; to reside in alternate years between the &quot;han&quot; and the court in Edo. During their absences from Edo, it was also required that they leave their family as hostages until their return. The hostages and the huge expenditure &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; imposed on each &quot;han&quot; helped to ensure loyalty to the &quot;shōgun&quot;. By the 1690s, the vast majority of daimyos would be born in Edo, and most would consider it their homes. Some daimyos had little interest in their domains and needed to be begged to return &quot;home&quot;.

In return for the centralization, peace among the daimyos was maintained; unlike in the Sengoku period, daimyos no longer worried about conflicts with one another. In addition, hereditary succession was guaranteed as internal usurpations within domains were not recognized by the shogunate.

==== Classification of daimyos ====
The Tokugawa clan further ensured loyalty by maintaining a dogmatic insistence on loyalty to the &quot;shōgun&quot;. Daimyos were classified into three main categories:

* &quot;Shinpan&quot; (&quot;relatives&quot; 親藩) were six clans established by sons of Ieyasu, as well as certain sons of the 8th and 9th shoguns, who were made daimyos. They would provide an heir to the shogunate if the shogun did not have an heir.
* &quot;Fudai&quot; (&quot;hereditary&quot; 譜代) were mostly vassals of Ieyasu and the Tokugawa clan before the Battle of Sekigahara. They ruled their &quot;han&quot; (estate) and served as high officials in the shogunate, although their &quot;han&quot; tended to be smaller compared to the &quot;tozama&quot; domains.
* &quot;Tozama&quot; (&quot;outsiders&quot; 外様) were around 100 daimyos, most of whom became vassals of the Tokugawa clan after the Battle of Sekigahara. Some fought against Tokugawa forces, although some were neutral or even fought on the side of the Tokugawa clan, as allies rather than vassals. The &quot;tozama daimyos&quot; tend to have the largest &quot;han&quot;, with 11 of the 16 largest daimyos in this category.

The &quot;tozama daimyos&quot; who fought against the Tokugawa clan in the Battle of Sekigahara had their estate reduced substantially. They were often placed in mountainous or far away areas, or placed between most trusted daimyos. Early in the Edo period, the shogunate viewed the &quot;tozama&quot; as the least likely to be loyal; over time, strategic marriages and the entrenchment of the system made the &quot;tozama&quot; less likely to rebel. In the end, however, it was still the great &quot;tozama&quot; of Satsuma, Chōshū and Tosa, and to a lesser extent Saga, that brought down the shogunate. These four states are called the Four Western Clans, or Satchotohi for short.

===Relations with the Emperor===
Regardless of the political title of the Emperor, the &quot;shōguns&quot; of the Tokugawa family controlled Japan. The shogunate secured a nominal grant of by the Imperial Court in Kyoto to the Tokugawa family. While the Emperor officially had the prerogative of appointing the &quot;shōgun&quot; and received generous subsidies, he had virtually no say in state affairs. The shogunate issued the Laws for the Imperial and Court Officials (&quot;kinchu narabini kuge shohatto&quot; 禁中並公家諸法度) to set out its relationship with the Imperial family and the &quot;kuge&quot; (imperial court officials), and specified that the Emperor should dedicate to scholarship and poetry. The shogunate also appointed a liaison, the &quot;Kyoto Shoshidai&quot; (&quot;Shogun&#x27;s Representative in Kyoto&quot;), to deal with the Emperor, court and nobility.

Towards the end of the shogunate, however, after centuries of the Emperor having very little say in state affairs and being secluded in his Kyoto palace, and in the wake of the reigning &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Iemochi, marrying the sister of Emperor Kōmei (r. 1846–1867), in 1862, the Imperial Court in Kyoto began to enjoy increased political influence. The Emperor would occasionally be consulted on various policies and the shogun even made a visit to Kyoto to visit the Emperor. Government administration would be formally returned from the &quot;shogun&quot; to the Emperor during the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

===Shogun and foreign trade===
Foreign affairs and trade were monopolized by the shogunate, yielding a huge profit. Foreign trade was also permitted to the Satsuma and the Tsushima domains. Rice was the main trading product of Japan during this time. Isolationism was the foreign policy of Japan and trade was strictly controlled. Merchants were outsiders to the social hierarchy of Japan and were thought to be greedy.

The visits of the Nanban ships from Portugal were at first the main vector of trade exchanges, followed by the addition of Dutch, English, and sometimes Spanish ships.

From 1603 onward, Japan started to participate actively in foreign trade. In 1615, an embassy and trade mission under Hasekura Tsunenaga was sent across the Pacific to Nueva España (New Spain) on the Japanese-built galleon &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;. Until 1635, the Shogun issued numerous permits for the so-called &quot;red seal ships&quot; destined for the Asian trade.

After 1635 and the introduction of seclusion laws (&quot;sakoku&quot;), inbound ships were only allowed from China, Korea, and the Netherlands.

=== Government income ===
The primary source of the shogunate&#x27;s income was the tax (around 40%) levied on harvests in the Tokugawa clan&#x27;s personal domains (tenryō). No taxes were levied on domains of daimyos, who instead provided military duty, public works and corvee. The shogunate obtained loans from merchants, which were sometimes seen as forced donations, although commerce was often not taxed. Special levies were also imposed for infrastructure-building.

== Shogunate institution ==
During the earliest years of the Tokugawa shogunate institution, when Tokugawa Hidetada coronated as the second shogun and Ieyasu retired, they formed a dual governments, where Hidetada controlled the official court with the government central located in Edo city, Ieyasu, who now became the &quot;Ōgosho&quot; (retired shogun), also control his own informal shadow government which called &quot;Sunpu government&quot; with its center at Sunpu Castle. The membership of the Sunpu government&#x27;s cabinet was consisted of trusted vassals of Ieyasu which was not included in Hidetada&#x27;s cabinet. including William Adams (samurai) and Jan Joosten van Lodensteijn, which Ieyasu entrusted with foreign affairs and diplomacy.

The earliest structure of Edo Shogunate organization has &quot;Buke Shitsuyaku&quot; as the highest rank. the earliest members of this office were Ii Naomasa, Sakakibara Yasumasa, and Honda Tadakatsu.

The personal vassals of the Tokugawa shoguns were classified into two groups:

* the bannermen (&quot;hatamoto&quot; 旗本) had the privilege to directly approach the shogun;
* the housemen (&quot;gokenin&quot; 御家人) did not have the privilege of the shogun&#x27;s audience.

By the early 18th century, out of around 22,000 personal vassals, most would have received stipends rather than domains.

===Rōjū and wakadoshiyori===
The &quot;rōjū&quot; () were normally the most senior members of the shogunate. Normally, four or five men held the office, and one was on duty for a month at a time on a rotating basis. They supervised the &quot;ōmetsuke&quot; (who checked on the daimyos), &quot;machi&quot;-&quot;bugyō&quot; (commissioners of administrative and judicial functions in major cities, especially Edo), &quot;&quot; (遠国奉行, the commissioners of other major cities and shogunate domains) and other officials, oversaw relations with the Imperial Court in Kyoto, kuge (members of the nobility), daimyō, Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, and attended to matters like divisions of fiefs. Other &quot;bugyō&quot; (commissioners) in charge of finances, monasteries and shrines also reported to the rōjū. The roju conferred on especially important matters. In the administrative reforms of 1867 (Keiō Reforms), the office was eliminated in favor of a bureaucratic system with ministers for the interior, finance, foreign relations, army, and navy.
In principle, the requirements for appointment to the office of rōjū were to be a &quot;fudai daimyō&quot; and to have a fief assessed at &quot;koku&quot; or more. However, there were exceptions to both criteria. Many appointees came from the offices close to the &quot;shōgun&quot;, such as &quot;&quot; (側用人), Kyoto Shoshidai, and Osaka-jō dai.

Irregularly, the &quot;shōguns&quot; appointed a &quot;rōjū&quot; to the position of &quot;tairō&quot; (great elder). The office was limited to members of the Ii, Sakai, Doi, and Hotta clans, but Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu was given the status of tairō as well. Among the most famous was Ii Naosuke, who was assassinated in 1860 outside the Sakuradamon Gate of Edo Castle (Sakuradamon incident).

Three to five men titled the &quot;wakadoshiyori&quot; (若年寄) were next in status below the rōjū. An outgrowth of the early six-man &quot;rokuninshū&quot; (六人衆, 1633–1649), the office took its name and final form in 1662. Their primary responsibility was management of the affairs of the hatamoto and gokenin, the direct vassals of the &quot;shōgun&quot;. Under the &quot;wakadoshiyori&quot; were the &quot;metsuke&quot;.

Some &quot;shōguns&quot; appointed a &quot;soba yōnin&quot;. This person acted as a liaison between the &quot;shōgun&quot; and the &quot;rōjū&quot;. The &quot;soba yōnin&quot; increased in importance during the time of the fifth &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, when a wakadoshiyori, Inaba Masayasu, assassinated Hotta Masatoshi, the &quot;tairō&quot;. Fearing for his personal safety, Tsunayoshi moved the &quot;rōjū&quot; to a more distant part of the castle. Some of the most famous &quot;soba yōnin&quot; were Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu and Tanuma Okitsugu.

===Ōmetsuke and metsuke===
The &quot;ōmetsuke&quot; and &quot;metsuke&quot; were officials who reported to the &quot;rōjū&quot; and &quot;wakadoshiyori&quot;. The five &quot;ōmetsuke&quot; were in charge of monitoring the affairs of the &quot;daimyōs&quot;, &quot;kuge&quot; and imperial court. They were in charge of discovering any threat of rebellion. Early in the Edo period, &quot;daimyōs&quot; such as Yagyū Munefuyu held the office. Soon, however, it fell to &quot;hatamoto&quot; with rankings of 5,000 &quot;koku&quot; or more. To give them authority in their dealings with &quot;daimyōs&quot;, they were often ranked at 10,000 &quot;koku&quot; and given the title of &quot;kami&quot; (an ancient title, typically signifying the governor of a province) such as &quot;Bizen-no-kami&quot;.

As time progressed, the function of the &quot;ōmetsuke&quot; evolved into one of passing orders from the shogunate to the &quot;daimyōs&quot;, and of administering to ceremonies within Edo Castle. They also took on additional responsibilities such as supervising religious affairs and controlling firearms. The &quot;metsuke&quot;, reporting to the &quot;wakadoshiyori&quot;, oversaw the affairs of the vassals of the &quot;shōgun&quot;. They were the police force for the thousands of hatamoto and gokenin who were concentrated in Edo. Individual &quot;han&quot; had their own &quot;metsuke&quot; who similarly policed their samurai.

===San-bugyō===
The &quot;san-bugyō&quot; (三奉行 &quot;three administrators&quot;) were the &quot;jisha&quot;, &quot;kanjō&quot;, and &quot;machi-bugyō&quot;, which respectively oversaw temples and shrines, accounting, and the cities. The &quot;jisha-bugyō&quot; had the highest status of the three. They oversaw the administration of Buddhist temples (&quot;ji&quot;) and Shinto shrines (&quot;sha&quot;), many of which held fiefs. Also, they heard lawsuits from several land holdings outside the eight Kantō provinces. The appointments normally went to &quot;daimyōs&quot;; Ōoka Tadasuke was an exception, though he later became a &quot;daimyō&quot;.

The &quot;kanjō-bugyō&quot; were next in status. The four holders of this office reported to the &quot;rōjū&quot;. They were responsible for the finances of the shogunate.

The &quot;machi-bugyō&quot; were the chief city administrators of Edo and other cities. Their roles included mayor, chief of the police (and, later, also of the fire department), and judge in criminal and civil matters not involving samurai. Two (briefly, three) men, normally hatamoto, held the office, and alternated by month.

Three Edo &quot;machi bugyō&quot; have become famous through &quot;jidaigeki&quot; (period films): Ōoka Tadasuke and Tōyama Kagemoto (Kinshirō) as heroes, and Torii Yōzō (:ja:鳥居耀蔵) as a villain.

===Tenryō, gundai and daikan===
The &quot;san-bugyō&quot; together sat on a council called the &quot;hyōjōsho&quot; (評定所). In this capacity, they were responsible for administering the &quot;tenryō&quot; (the shogun&#x27;s estates), supervising the &quot;gundai&quot; (郡代), the &quot;daikan&quot; (代官) and the &quot;kura bugyō&quot; (蔵奉行), as well as hearing cases involving samurai. The &quot;gundai&quot; managed Tokugawa domains with incomes greater than 10,000 koku while the &quot;daikan&quot; managed areas with incomes between 5,000 and 10,000 koku.

The shogun directly held lands in various parts of Japan. These were known as &quot;shihaisho&quot; (支配所); since the Meiji period, the term &quot;tenryō&quot; (天領, literally &quot;Emperor&#x27;s land&quot;) has become synonymous, because the shogun&#x27;s lands were returned to the emperor. In addition to the territory that Ieyasu held prior to the Battle of Sekigahara, this included lands he gained in that battle and lands gained as a result of the Summer and Winter Sieges of Osaka. Major cities as Nagasaki and Osaka, and mines, including the Sado gold mine, also fell into this category.

===Gaikoku bugyō===
The &quot;gaikoku bugyō&quot; were administrators appointed between 1858 and 1868. They were charged with overseeing trade and diplomatic relations with foreign countries, and were based in the treaty ports of Nagasaki and Kanagawa (Yokohama).

<text>Josef Rudolf Mengele (; 16 March 19117 February 1979) was a German (SS) officer and physician during World War II at the Russian front and then at Auschwitz during the Holocaust, where he was nicknamed the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; (). He performed deadly experiments on prisoners at the Auschwitz II (Birkenau) concentration camp, where he was a member of the team of doctors who selected victims to be murdered in the gas chambers, and was one of the doctors who administered the gas.

Before the war, Mengele received doctorates in anthropology and medicine, and began a career as a researcher. He joined the Nazi Party in 1937 and the SS in 1938. He was assigned as a battalion medical officer at the start of World War II, then transferred to the Nazi concentration camps service in early 1943. He was assigned to Auschwitz, where he saw the opportunity to conduct genetic research on human subjects. His experiments focused primarily on twins, with no regard for the health or safety of the victims. With Red Army troops sweeping through German-occupied Poland, Mengele was transferred away from Auschwitz to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp on 17 January 1945, ten days before the arrival of the Soviet forces at Auschwitz.

After the war, Mengele fled to Argentina in July 1949, assisted by a network of former SS members. He initially lived in and around Buenos Aires, but fled to Paraguay in 1959 and later Brazil in 1960, all while being sought by West Germany, Israel, and Nazi hunters such as Simon Wiesenthal, who wanted to bring him to trial. Mengele eluded capture in spite of extradition requests by the West German government and clandestine operations by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. He drowned in 1979 after suffering a heart attack while swimming off the coast of Bertioga, and was buried under the false name of Wolfgang Gerhard. His remains were disinterred and positively identified by forensic examination in 1985.

==Early life==
Mengele was born into a Catholic family in Günzburg, Bavaria, on 16 March 1911, the eldest of three sons of Walburga ( Hupfauer) and Karl Mengele. His two younger brothers were Karl Jr. and Alois. Their father was the founder of the Karl Mengele &amp; Sons company (later renamed ), which produced farming machinery. Mengele was successful at school and developed an interest in music, art, and skiing. He completed high school in April 1930 and went on to study philosophy in Munich, where the headquarters of the Nazi Party were located. He attended the University of Bonn, where he took his medical preliminary examination. In 1931, he joined , a paramilitary organization that was absorbed into the Nazi (&#x27;Storm Detachment&#x27;; SA) in 1934. In 1935, Mengele earned a PhD in anthropology from the University of Munich. In January 1937, he joined the Institute for Hereditary Biology and Racial Hygiene in Frankfurt, where he worked for Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer, a German geneticist with a particular interest in researching twins.

As Von Verschuer&#x27;s assistant, Mengele focused on the genetic factors that result in a cleft lip and palate, or a cleft chin. His thesis on the subject earned him a doctorate in medicine (MD) from the University of Frankfurt in 1938. (Both of his degrees were revoked by the issuing universities in the 1960s.) In a letter of recommendation, Von Verschuer praised Mengele&#x27;s reliability and his ability to verbally present complex material in a clear manner. The American author Robert Jay Lifton notes that Mengele&#x27;s published works were in keeping with the scientific mainstream of the time, and would probably have been viewed as valid scientific efforts even outside Nazi Germany. On 28 July 1939, Mengele married Irene Schönbein, whom he had met while working as a medical resident in Leipzig. Their only son, Rolf, was born in 1944.

==Military career==
The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics, and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more (&quot;living space&quot;) for the Germanic people. Nazi Germany attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or murder the Jews and Slavs living there, who were considered by the Nazis to be inferior to the putative &quot;Aryan master race&quot;.

Mengele joined the Nazi Party in 1937 and the (SS) in 1938. He received basic training in 1938 with the (mountain light infantry) and was called up for service in the (Nazi armed forces) in June 1940, some months after the outbreak of World War II. He soon volunteered for medical service in the , the combat arm of the SS, where he served with the rank of SS- (second lieutenant) in a medical reserve battalion until November 1940. He was next assigned to the SS Race and Settlement Main Office in Poznań, evaluating candidates for Germanization.

In June 1941, Mengele was posted to Ukraine, where he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class. In January 1942, he joined the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking as a battalion medical officer. After rescuing two German soldiers from a burning tank, he was decorated with the Iron Cross 1st Class, the Wound Badge in Black, and the Medal for the Care of the German People. He was declared unfit for further active service in mid-1942, when he was seriously wounded in action near Rostov-on-Don. Following his recovery, he was transferred to the headquarters of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office in Berlin, at which point he resumed his association with Von Verschuer, who had become director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics. Mengele was promoted to the rank of (captain) in April 1943.

==Auschwitz==
In 1942, Auschwitz II (Birkenau), originally intended to house slave laborers, began to be used instead as a combined labour camp and extermination camp. Prisoners were transported there by rail from all over Nazi-controlled Europe, arriving in daily convoys. By July 1942, SS doctors were conducting selections where incoming Jews were segregated, and those considered able to work were admitted into the camp while those deemed unfit for labor were immediately murdered in the gas chambers. Those selected to be killed, about three-quarters of the total, included almost all children, women with small children, pregnant women, all the elderly, and all of those who appeared (in a brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor) to be not completely fit and healthy.

In early 1943, Von Verschuer encouraged Mengele to apply for a transfer to the concentration camp service. Mengele&#x27;s application was accepted and he was posted to Auschwitz, where he was appointed by SS- Eduard Wirths, chief medical officer at Auschwitz, to the position of chief physician of the (Romani family camp) at Birkenau, a subcamp located on the main Auschwitz complex. The SS doctors did not administer treatment to the Auschwitz inmates but supervised the activities of inmate doctors who had been forced to work in the camp medical service. As part of his duties, Mengele made weekly visits to the hospital barracks and ordered any prisoners who had not recovered after two weeks in bed to be sent to the gas chambers.

Mengele&#x27;s work also involved carrying out selections, a task that he chose to perform even when he was not assigned to do so, in the hope of finding subjects for his experiments, with a particular interest in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the other SS doctors, who viewed selections as one of their most stressful and unpleasant duties, he undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling. He was one of the SS doctors responsible for supervising the administration of Zyklon B, the cyanide-based pesticide that was used for the mass killings in the Birkenau gas chambers. He served in this capacity at the gas chambers located in crematoria IV and V.

When an outbreak of noma—a gangrenous bacterial disease of the mouth and face—struck the Romani camp in 1943, Mengele initiated a study to determine the cause of the disease and develop a treatment. He enlisted the assistance of prisoner Berthold Epstein, a Jewish pediatrician and professor at Prague University. The patients were isolated in separate barracks and several afflicted children were killed so that their preserved heads and organs could be sent to the SS Medical Academy in Graz and other facilities for study. This research was still ongoing when the Romani camp was liquidated and its remaining occupants murdered in 1944.

When a typhus epidemic began in the women&#x27;s camp, Mengele cleared one block of six hundred Jewish women and sent them to be killed in the gas chambers. The building was then cleaned and disinfected and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de–loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. This process was repeated until all of the barracks were disinfected. Similar procedures were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, with infected prisoners being murdered in the gas chambers. For these actions, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.

===Human experimentation===


Mengele used Auschwitz as an opportunity to continue his anthropological studies and research into heredity, using inmates for medical experimentation. His medical experiments showed no consideration for the victims&#x27; health, safety, or physical and emotional suffering. He was particularly interested in identical twins, people with heterochromia iridum (eyes of two different colors), dwarfs, and people with physical abnormalities. Elizabeth Moscowitz, who was a member of the Ovitz family, testified that upon seeing her and other members of her family Mengele exclaimed &quot;Now I have work for 20 years&quot;. Twin research was of particular interest to Mengele, as one twin could serve as subject with the other as the control. Miklós Nyiszli and others reported that the twin studies may also have been motivated by an intention to uncover strategies for &#x27;racially desirable&#x27; Germans to reproduce more twins. A grant was later provided by the (&#x27;German Research Foundation&#x27;), at the request of Von Verschuer, who received regular reports and shipments of specimens from Mengele. The grant was used to build a pathology laboratory attached to Crematorium II at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Nyiszli, who was forced to work on Mengele&#x27;s behalf due to his pathologist background, prepared specimens and performed autopsies for this laboratory.

Mengele&#x27;s research subjects were better fed and housed than the other prisoners, and temporarily spared from the gas chambers. His research subjects lived in their own barracks, where they were provided with a marginally better quality of food and somewhat improved living conditions than the other areas of the camp. When visiting his young subjects, he introduced himself as &quot;Uncle Mengele&quot; and offered them sweets. A former Auschwitz inmate doctor said of Mengele:

In his twin experiments, Mengele generally ordered the twins to undertake weekly physical examinations. Then, he would subject them to a variety of procedures, including amputating healthy limbs, deliberately infecting them with diseases such as typhus, and transfusing the blood of one twin into another. Many died during the procedures, and those who survived were often killed and dissected for comparative post-mortem reports. Nyiszli recalled one occasion where Mengele killed 14 twins at the same time by injecting their hearts with chloroform. Some twins were sewn back to back in an attempt to create conjoined twins. 

Other experiments he performed included injecting chemicals into inmates&#x27; eyes to change their eye color, removing the eyes of dead inmates and occasionally &quot;pinning them on walls like butterflies&quot;, removing the teeth and blood of dwarfs and inmates with physical abnormalities, and forcing inmates to undergo unnecessary drug and X-ray treatments. Pregnant women were also victims of these experiments. Survivors were typically sent to the gas chambers within weeks. Their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further analysis. Mengele removed the hearts and stomachs of victims without anesthesia and forced one inmate who survived the removal of a kidney to work without painkillers afterwards.

In his 1986 book, Lifton described Mengele as sadistic, lacking empathy, and extremely antisemitic, believing the Jews should be eliminated as an inferior and dangerous race. He also believed that he was responsible for an unknown number of deaths via other experiments, lethal injections, beatings, and shootings.

==After Auschwitz==
Along with several other Auschwitz doctors, Mengele transferred to Gross-Rosen concentration camp in Lower Silesia on 17 January 1945, taking with him two boxes of specimens and the records of his experiments at Auschwitz. Most of the camp medical records had already been destroyed by the SS by the time the Red Army liberated Auschwitz on 27 January. Mengele fled Gross-Rosen on 18 February, a week before the Soviets arrived there, and traveled westward to Žatec in Czechoslovakia, disguised as a officer. There he temporarily entrusted his incriminating documents to a nurse with whom he had struck up a relationship. He and his unit then hurried west to avoid being captured by the Soviets, but were taken prisoners of war by the Americans in June 1945. Although Mengele was initially registered under his own name, he was not identified as being on the major war criminal list due to the disorganization of the Allies regarding the distribution of wanted lists, and the fact that he did not have the usual SS blood group tattoo. He was released at the end of July and obtained false papers under the name &quot;Fritz Ulmann&quot;, documents he later altered to read &quot;Fritz Hollmann&quot;.

After several months on the run, including a trip back to the Soviet-occupied area to recover his Auschwitz records, Mengele found work near Rosenheim as a farmhand. He eventually escaped from Germany on 17 April 1949, convinced that his capture would mean a trial and death sentence. Assisted by a network of former SS members, he used the ratline to travel to Genoa, where he obtained a passport from the International Committee of the Red Cross under the alias &quot;Helmut Gregor&quot;, and sailed to Argentina in July 1949. His wife refused to accompany him, and they divorced by proxy in Düsseldorf in 1954.

==In South America==

Mengele worked as a carpenter in Buenos Aires, Argentina, while lodging in a boarding house in the suburb of Vicente López. After a few weeks, he moved to the house of a Nazi sympathizer in the neighborhood of Florida Este. He next worked as a salesman for his family&#x27;s farm equipment company, Karl Mengele &amp; Sons, and in 1951 he began making frequent trips to Paraguay as a regional sales representative. He moved into an apartment in central Buenos Aires in 1953, used family funds to buy a part interest in a carpentry concern, and then rented a house in the suburb of Olivos in 1954. Files released by the Argentine government in 1992 indicate that Mengele may have practiced medicine without a license while living in Buenos Aires, including performing abortions.

After obtaining a copy of his birth certificate through the West German embassy in 1956, Mengele was issued an Argentine foreign residence permit under his real name. He used this document to obtain a West German passport using his real name and embarked on a trip to Europe. He met with his son Rolf (who was told Mengele was his &quot;Uncle Fritz&quot;) and his widowed sister-in-law Martha, for a ski holiday in Switzerland; he also spent a week in his home town of Günzburg. When he returned to Argentina in September 1956, Mengele began living under his real name. Martha and her son Karl Heinz followed about a month later, and the three began living together. Josef and Martha were married in 1958 while on holiday in Uruguay, and they bought a house in Buenos Aires. Mengele&#x27;s business interests now included part ownership of Fadro Farm, a pharmaceutical company. Along with several other doctors, he was questioned in 1958 on suspicion of practicing medicine without a license when a teenage girl died after an abortion, but he was released without charge. Aware that the publicity could lead to his Nazi background and wartime activities being discovered, he took an extended business trip to Paraguay and was granted citizenship there in 1959 under the name &quot;José Mengele&quot;. He returned to Buenos Aires several times to settle his business affairs and visit his family. Martha and Karl lived in a boarding house in the city until December 1960, when they returned to West Germany.

Mengele&#x27;s name was mentioned several times during the Nuremberg trials in the mid-1940s, but the Allied forces believed that he was probably already dead. Irene Mengele and the family in Günzburg also claimed that he had died. Working in West Germany, Nazi hunters Simon Wiesenthal and Hermann Langbein collected information from witnesses about Mengele&#x27;s wartime activities. In a search of the public records, Langbein discovered Mengele&#x27;s divorce papers, which listed an address in Buenos Aires. He and Wiesenthal pressured the West German authorities into starting extradition proceedings, and an arrest warrant was drawn up on 5 June 1959. Argentina initially refused the extradition request because the fugitive was no longer living at the address given on the documents; by the time extradition was approved on 30 June, Mengele had already fled to Paraguay and was living on a farm in Hohenau, near the Argentine border. Mengele reportedly worked as a veterinary surgeon under the alias of &#x27;Francisco Fischer&#x27; while living in Hohenau, before leaving Paraguay for Brazil sometime in 1964. After a request from Paraguayan Attorney General Clotildo Jimenez, the Supreme Court of Paraguay annulled Mengele&#x27;s citizenship in August 1979.

===Efforts by Mossad===
In May 1960, Isser Harel, director of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, personally led the successful effort to capture Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires. He was hoping to track down Mengele so that he too could be brought to trial in Israel. Under interrogation, Eichmann provided the address of a boarding house that had been used as a safe house for Nazi fugitives. Surveillance of the house did not reveal Mengele or any members of his family, and the neighborhood postman claimed that although Mengele had recently been receiving letters there under his real name, he had since relocated without leaving a forwarding address. Harel&#x27;s inquiries at a machine shop where Mengele had been part owner also failed to generate any leads, so he was forced to abandon the search.

Despite having provided Mengele with legal documents using his real name in 1956 (which had enabled him to formalize his permanent residency in Argentina), West Germany was now offering a reward for his capture. Continuing newspaper coverage of his wartime activities, with accompanying photographs, led Mengele to relocate again in 1960. Former pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel put him in touch with the Nazi supporter Wolfgang Gerhard, who helped Mengele cross the border into Brazil. He stayed with Gerhard on his farm near São Paulo until a more permanent accommodation could be found, which came about with Hungarian expatriates Géza and Gitta Stammer. The couple bought a farm in Nova Europa with the help of an investment from Mengele, who was given the job of managing for them. The three bought a coffee and cattle farm in Serra Negra in 1962, with Mengele owning a half interest. Gerhard had initially told the Stammers that the fugitive&#x27;s name was &quot;Peter Hochbichler&quot;, but they discovered his true identity in 1963. Gerhard persuaded the couple not to report Mengele&#x27;s location to the authorities by convincing them that they themselves could be implicated for harboring a fugitive. In February 1961, West Germany widened its extradition request to include Brazil, having been tipped off to the possibility that Mengele had relocated there.

Meanwhile, Zvi Aharoni, one of the Mossad agents who had been involved in the Eichmann capture, was placed in charge of a team of agents tasked with tracking down Mengele and bringing him to trial in Israel. Their inquiries in Paraguay revealed no clues to his whereabouts, and they were unable to intercept any correspondence between Mengele and his wife Martha, who by this time was living in Italy. Agents who were following Rudel&#x27;s movements also failed to produce any leads. Aharoni and his team followed Gerhard to a rural area near São Paulo, where they identified a European man whom they believed to be Mengele. This potential breakthrough was reported to Harel, but the logistics of staging a capture, the budgetary constraints of the search operation, and the priority of focusing on Israel&#x27;s deteriorating relationship with Egypt led the Mossad chief to call off the manhunt in 1962.

===Later life and death===
In 1969, Mengele and the Stammers jointly purchased a farmhouse in Caieiras, with Mengele as half owner. When Wolfgang Gerhard returned to Germany in 1971 to seek medical treatment for his ailing wife and son, he gave his identity card to Mengele. The Stammers&#x27; friendship with Mengele deteriorated in late 1974, and when they bought a house in São Paulo, he was not invited to join them. The Stammers later bought a bungalow in the Eldorado neighborhood of Diadema, São Paulo, which they rented out to Mengele. Rolf, who had not seen his father since the ski holiday in 1956, visited him at the bungalow in 1977; he found an &quot;unrepentant Nazi&quot; who claimed he had never personally harmed anyone and only carried out his duties as an officer.

Mengele&#x27;s health had been steadily deteriorating since 1972. He suffered a stroke in 1976, experienced high blood pressure, and developed an ear infection which affected his balance. On 7 February 1979, while visiting his friends Wolfram and Liselotte Bossert in the coastal resort of Bertioga, Mengele had a heart attack while swimming and drowned. His body was buried in Our Lady of the Rosary cemetery in Embu das Artes under the name &quot;Wolfgang Gerhard&quot;, whose identification Mengele had been using since 1971. Other aliases used by Mengele in his later life included &quot;Dr. Fausto Rindón&quot; and &quot;S. Josi Alvers Aspiazu&quot;.

==Exhumation==

Sightings of Mengele were being reported all over the world in the decades following the war. Wiesenthal claimed to have information that placed Mengele on the Greek island of Kythnos in 1960, in Cairo in 1961, in Spain in 1971, and in Paraguay in 1978, eighteen years after he had left the country. He insisted as late as 1985 that Mengele was still alive—six years after he had died—having previously offered a reward of US$100,000 () in 1982 for the fugitive&#x27;s capture. Worldwide interest in the case was heightened by a mock trial held in Jerusalem in February 1985, featuring the testimonies of over one hundred victims of Mengele&#x27;s experiments. Shortly afterwards, the West German, Israeli, and U.S. governments launched a coordinated effort to determine Mengele&#x27;s whereabouts. The West German and Israeli governments offered rewards for his capture, as did &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

On 31 May 1985, acting on intelligence received by the West German prosecutor&#x27;s office, police raided the house of Hans Sedlmeier, a lifelong friend of Mengele and sales manager of the family firm in Günzburg. They found a coded address book and copies of letters sent to and received from Mengele. Among the papers was a letter from Wolfram Bossert notifying Sedlmeier of Mengele&#x27;s death. German authorities alerted the police in São Paulo, who then contacted the Bosserts. Under interrogation, they revealed the location of Mengele&#x27;s grave and the remains were exhumed on 6 June 1985. Extensive forensic examination indicated with a high degree of probability that the body was indeed that of Josef Mengele. Rolf Mengele issued a statement on 10 June confirming that the body was his father&#x27;s and that news of his father&#x27;s death had been concealed to protect people who had sheltered him.

In 1992, DNA testing confirmed Mengele&#x27;s identity beyond doubt, but family members refused repeated requests by Brazilian officials to repatriate the remains to Germany. The skeleton is stored at the São Paulo Institute for Forensic Medicine, where it is used as an educational aid during forensic medicine courses at the University of São Paulo&#x27;s medical school.

==Later developments==

In 2007, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum received as a donation the Höcker Album, an album of photographs of Auschwitz staff taken by Karl-Friedrich Höcker. Eight of the photographs include Mengele. In February 2010, a 180-page volume of Mengele&#x27;s diary was sold by Alexander Autographs at auction for an undisclosed sum to the grandson of a Holocaust survivor. The unidentified previous owner, who acquired the journals in Brazil, was reported to be close to the Mengele family. A Holocaust survivors&#x27; organization described the sale as &quot;a cynical act of exploitation aimed at profiting from the writings of one of the most heinous Nazi criminals&quot;. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center was glad to see the diary fall into Jewish hands, calling the acquisition significant. In 2011 (centenary of Mengele&#x27;s birth), a further 31 volumes of Mengele&#x27;s diaries were sold—again amidst protests—by the same auction house to an undisclosed collector of World War II memorabilia for US$245,000.

==Publications==
* &quot;Racial-Morphological Examinations of the Anterior Portion of the Lower Jaw in Four Racial Groups&quot;. This dissertation, completed in 1935 and first published in 1937, earned him a PhD in anthropology from Munich University. In this work Mengele sought to demonstrate that there were structural differences in the lower jaws of individuals from different ethnic groups, and that racial distinctions could be made based on these differences.
* &quot;Genealogical Studies in the Cases of Cleft Lip-Jaw-Palate&quot; (1938), his medical dissertation, earned him a doctorate in medicine from Frankfurt University. Studying the influence of genetics as a factor in the occurrence of this deformity, Mengele conducted research on families who exhibited these traits in multiple generations. The work also included notes on other abnormalities found in these family lines.
* &quot;Hereditary Transmission of Fistulae Auris&quot;. This journal article, published in (&#x27;The Genetic Physician&#x27;), focuses on fistula auris (an abnormal fissure on the external ear) as a hereditary trait. Mengele noted that individuals who have this trait also tend to have a dimple on their chin.

<text>The is the period in Japanese history in which civil wars and social upheavals took place almost continuously in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Kyōtoku incident (1454), Ōnin War (1467), or (1493) are generally chosen as the period&#x27;s start date, but there are many competing historiographies for its end date, ranging from 1568, the date of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s march on Kyoto, to the suppression of the Shimabara Rebellion in 1638, deep into what is traditionally considered the Edo period. Regardless of the dates chosen, the Sengoku period overlaps substantially with the Muromachi period (1336–1573).
This period was characterized by the overthrow of a superior power by a subordinate one. The Ashikaga shogunate, the &quot;de facto&quot; central government, declined and the , a local power, seized wider political influence. The people rebelled against the feudal lords in revolts known as .

The period saw a breakdown in the traditional master-servant relationship between a lord and his vassals, with many instances of vassals rebelling against their lords, internal dynastic conflict over lordships within noble families (in which vassals would take sides), and the installation of figurehead lords by cadet branches of noble families. The period was also marked by the loosening of samurai culture, with people born into other social strata sometimes making a name for themselves as warriors and thus becoming samurai. In turn, events sometimes allowed common samurai to rise to the rank of &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot;; these included Hōjō Sōun (the first to do so), and Uesugi Kenshin, a who attained power by weakening and eventually replacing his lord. The most spectacular example of a &quot;sengoku&quot;-era rise is often considered to be that of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who rose from a peasant background to successively become a samurai, &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot;, and &quot;kampaku&quot; (Imperial Regent).

Modern Japan recognizes Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu as for their restoration of Japan&#x27;s central government.

== Background ==
During this period, although the Emperor of Japan was officially the ruler of the state and every lord swore loyalty to him, he was largely a marginalized, ceremonial, and religious figure who delegated power to the &quot;shōgun&quot;, a noble who was roughly equivalent to a military dictator.

From 1346 to 1358, during the Nanboku-cho period, the Ashikaga shogunate gradually expanded the authority of the , the local military and police officials established by the Kamakura shogunate, giving the &quot;Shugo&quot; jurisdiction over land disputes between and allowing the &quot;Shugo&quot; to receive half of all taxes from the areas they controlled. The &quot;Shugo&quot; shared their newfound wealth with the local samurai, creating a hierarchical relationship between the &quot;Shugo&quot; and the samurai, and the first early , called , appeared.

In 1428, Ashikaga Yoshimochi, the fourth shogun, was ill and the question of his succession arose. Ashikaga Yoshikazu, the 5th shogun, died of illness at the age of 19, so the 6th shogun was chosen from among Yoshimochi&#x27;s four brothers, and to ensure fairness, a lottery was held. The sixth shogun was Ashikaga Yoshinori. But he was not educated to be a shogun, and his temperamental and despotic behavior caused resentment. Akamatsu Mitsusuke assassinated him during the Kakitsu Rebellion. This led to instability in the Ashikaga shogunate system. The shogunate gradually lost influence and control over the &quot;daimyo&quot;.

== Beginning of the Sengoku period ==

The beginning of the Sengoku Period is considered to be the Kyōtoku incident, Ōnin War, or Meiō incident. 

The Kyōtoku Incident was a major war in the Kanto region that lasted from 1454 to 1482. The war began when Ashikaga Shigeuji of , the office of the Ashikaga shogunate in charge of the Kanto region, killed Uesugi Noritada of , Kantō kubō&#x27;s assistant. The various forces in the Kanto region divided and fought between the &quot;Kubō&quot; and &quot;Kanrei&quot; sides, with the Ashikaga shogunate supporting the &quot;Kanrei&quot; side.

Ashikaga Yoshimasa, the 8th shogun, tried to strengthen the power of the shogun, but his close associates did not follow his instructions, leading to political chaos and increasing social unrest. Since he had no sons, he tried to install his younger brother Ashikaga Yoshimi as the ninth shogun, but when his wife Hino Tomiko gave birth to Ashikaga Yoshihisa, a conflict arose among the &quot;shugo daimyo&quot; as to whether Yoshimi or Yoshihisa would be the next shogun. The Hatakeyama and Shiba clans were also divided into two opposing factions over succession within their own clans, and Hosokawa Katsumoto and Yamana Sōzen, who were father-in-law and son-in-law, were politically at odds with each other.

In 1467, these conflicts finally led to the Ōnin War (1467–1477) between the Eastern Army, led by Hosokawa Katsumoto and including Hatakeyama Masanaga, Shiba Yoshitoshi, and Ashikaga Yoshimi, and the Western Army, led by Yamana Sōzen and including Hatakeyama Yoshinari, Shiba Yoshikado, and Ashikaga Yoshihisa.　In 1469, the war spread to the provinces, but in 1473, Hosokawa Katsumoto and Yamana Sōzen, the leaders of both armies, died. In 1477, the war ended when the western lords, including Hatakeyama Yoshinari and Ōuchi Masahiro, withdrew their armies from Kyoto. 

The war devastated two-thirds of Kyoto, destroying many aristocratic and samurai residences, Shinto shrines, and Buddhist temples, and undermining the authority of the Ashikaga shoguns, greatly reducing their control over the various regions. The war caused disarray which rippled across Japan. In addition to the military confrontations between separate states, there was also domestic fallout. In contempt of the shogunate, the daimyo who were subjected to remain in Kyoto instead returned to their provinces. Consequentially, some of these daimyo found that their designated retainers or &quot;shugodai&quot;, representatives of their states appointed in a daimyo&#x27;s absence, rose in power either to seize control of the domain or proclaim independence as a separate domain.

Thus began the Sengoku period, a period of civil war in which the &quot;daimyo&quot; of various regions fought to expand their own power. &quot;Daimyo&quot; who became more powerful as the shogunate&#x27;s control weakened were called , and they often came from &quot;shugo daimyo&quot;, &quot;Shugodai&quot;, and . In other words, &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; differed from &quot;shugo daimyo&quot; in that &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; was able to rule the region on his own, without being appointed by the shogun.

Historians often consider the Ōnin War, a ten-year conflict wrought by political turmoil, to be the trigger for what would come to be known as the Sengoku period. This civil war would clearly reveal the Ashikaga shogunate&#x27;s reduced authority over its shogunal administration, the provincial &quot;daimyo&quot; and Japan as a whole; thereby a wave of unbridled conflict would spread across Japan and consume the states in an age of war. 
Furthermore, weariness of war, socioeconomic unrest and poor treatment by aristocrats provoked the wrath of the peasant class. Farmers, craftsmen, merchants and even villages would organize uprisings (known as &quot;&quot;ikki&quot;)&quot; against the ruling class. An extraordinary example is the Kaga Rebellion, in which the local &quot;ikki&quot; had staged a large-scale revolt with the support of the True Pure Land sect (thereby establishing the term &quot;ikkō ikki)&quot; and assumed control of the entire province of Kaga. It is suggested by both scholars and authors that &quot;&quot;these succession disputes still might not have led to war were it not for the shōgun&#x27;s lack of leadership&quot;.&quot;

== Timeline ==

=== Start and end dates ===

The Kyōtoku incident in 1454, Ōnin War in 1467, or Meiō incident in 1493 is usually considered the starting point of the Sengoku period. There are several events which could be considered the end of it: Nobunaga&#x27;s entry to Kyoto (1568) or abolition of the Muromachi shogunate (1573) or entry into Azuchi Castle (1576), Hideyoshi&#x27;s promulgation of the &quot;Sōbujirei&quot; (ja) law prohibiting war (1587), the siege of Odawara (1590), the Battle of Sekigahara (1600), the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate (1603), the siege of Osaka (1615), or the suppression of the Shimabara Rebellion (1638). The old, well-known definition is that the Onin War initiated the Sengoku period in 1467; and that it ended in 1568, when Oda Nobunaga entered Kyoto in support of Ashikaga Yoshiaki.

However, even if 1568 is the end date of the Sengoku period, there are also various theories about the beginning and end dates of the following Azuchi-Momoyama period. The Azuchi-Momoyama period refers to the period when Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi were in power. They and Tokugawa Ieyasu are the three unifiers of Japan. The name &quot;Azuchi-Momoyama&quot; comes from the fact that Nobunaga&#x27;s castle, Azuchi Castle, was located in Azuchi, Shiga, and Fushimi Castle, where Hideyoshi lived after his retirement, was located in Momoyama. The beginning date could be either when Oda Nobunaga entered Kyoto in 1568 to support Ashikaga Yoshiaki, or when Nobunaga expelled Ashikaga Yoshiaki from Kyoto in 1573 and destroyed the Muromachi Shogunate, or when Nobunaga moved to Azuchi Castle in 1576. It ended either when Toyotomi Hideyoshi died in 1598, or at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, or with the opening of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603.

Kaga ikki occurred in 1488, Hōjō Sōun conquered Izu province in 1491, and in 1492 Hosokawa Masamoto banished the 10th shogun Ashikaga Yoshitane from Kyoto and installed Ashikaga Yoshizumi as the 11th shogun. Around this time, civil wars began to occur frequently throughout the country, and Buddhist temples in various regions grew as armed forces.

=== Kansai region and Kyoto===
==== Puppetization of the Ashikaga Shogunate by the Hosokawa clan ====

Ashikaga Yoshihisa, who had become the ninth shogun during the Onin War, died at the age of 25, and Ashikaga Yoshitane became the 10th shogun. However, in 1493, Hosokawa Masamoto raised an army while shogun Yoshitane was away in Kyoto and installed the 11th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshizumi, in a de facto coup known as the . Masamoto held the position of , second only to the shogun in the Ashikaga shogunate, and the equivalent of in the Kamakura shogunate. This made the shogun a puppet of the Hosokawa clan, which served as the &quot;Kanrei&quot;. In recent years, it has been theorized that this incident marked the beginning of the Sengoku period.

Hosokawa Masamoto remained a bachelor for the rest of his life and adopted three people as his heirs. Following the advice of his vassals, Masamoto named Hosokawa Sumimoto as his successor instead of Hosokawa Sumiyuki, who had been adopted first. As a result, Masamoto was killed by Sumiyuki in 1507. This incident is called . This triggered a struggle for the succession of the Hosokawa clan, which was divided into the Hosokawa Sumimoto faction and the Hosokawa Takakuni faction, and started a war called , which was won by Hosokawa Takakuni.

Hosokawa Takakuni installed Ashikaga Yoshiharu as the 12th shogun. Meanwhile, Hosokawa Harumoto, son of Hosokawa Sumimoto, who had lost the war, collaborated with Miyoshi Motonaga to defeat Takakuni at the in 1527 and expel him from Kyoto. The authority of the &quot;Kanrei&quot; was thus destroyed, and with almost no support for Hosokawa Takakuni, he was forced to move from place to place. He gained the &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; Uragami Muramune as an ally and fought Hosokawa Harumoto in a war called in 1531, but was defeated.

Hosokawa Harumoto seized power, but he alienated Miyoshi Motonaga, who was his retainer but still held a strong position of power. Harumoto seduced the Ikkō-shū into a &quot;Ikkō-ikki&quot; against Motonaga, which resulted in Motonaga&#x27;s death in 1532.

==== The rise of the Miyoshi clan ====

Miyoshi Motonaga&#x27;s son, Miyoshi Nagayoshi, fought against Hosokawa Harumoto, but chose to subordinate himself to Harumoto. As a follower of Harumoto, Miyoshi Nagayoshi defeated Kizawa Nagamasa, the most powerful member of the Hatakeyama clan who served as &quot;Kanrei&quot;, and in 1547 defeated the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu and Hosokawa Ujitusna, son of Hosokawa Takakuni, in the . This further reduced the power of the Ashikaga Shogunate. Miyoshi Nagayoshi was told by a retainer of the Hosokawa family that Miyoshi Masanaga had played a dark role in his father&#x27;s death, and he petitioned his lord Hosokawa Harumoto to overthrow Masanaga, but this petition was not accepted, and, in turn, Nagayoshi was almost eliminated by Harumoto. In response, Miyoshi Nagayoshi attacked and defeated Miyoshi Masanaga, expelled Hosokawa Harumoto, Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun, and his son Ashikaga Yoshiteru from Kyoto, and established control over the Kyoto area in 1549. After that, he fought several times against Ashikaga Yoshiteru, who became the 13th shogun, for control of the Kyoto area. However, one by one, his sons died in war or from disease, and the Miyoshi clan began to decline rapidly.

By the time of the 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, the shogun already had few direct fiefs and direct military forces, and his sphere of influence was limited to a few lands around Kyoto, losing both economic and military power. As a result, Ashikaga Yoshiteru was often chased out of Kyoto by the &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; Miyoshi Nagayoshi and his forces, and was finally killed in an attack by the forces of Miyoshi Yoshitsugu and Matsunaga Hisahide. Ashikaga Yoshiteru was known as a great swordsman and was a student of Tsukahara Bokuden, who was known as one of the strongest swordsmen. According to Yagyū Munenori, a swordsmanship instructor in the Tokugawa Shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiteru was one of the five best swordsmen of his time. According to several historical books, including Luís Fróis&#x27; &quot;Historia de Japam&quot;, he fought hard with &quot;naginata&quot; and &quot;tachi&quot; during a raid, defeating many of his enemies, but eventually ran out of strength and was killed.

 of Miyoshi Nagayasu, Miyoshi Soui, and Iwanari Tomomichi supported the young head of the clan, Miyoshi Yoshitsugu, in leading the Miyoshi clan. However, after the assassination of the 13th Shogun, the trio fell out with another Miyoshi follower, Matsunaga Hisashige, over the 14th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshihide, and war broke out. The latter three also came into conflict with Yoshitsugu. The Miyoshi regime virtually collapsed when Oda Nobunaga entered Kyoto in 1568. Miyoshi Yoshitugu and Matsunaga Hisahide submitted to Nobunaga, but were later killed by Nobunaga&#x27;s forces. The trio was weakened and the Miyoshi clan declined.

=== Other regions ===
====Chūgoku region (Mōri Motonari)====

Mōri Motonari was a &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; who pacified the Chūgoku region and is famous for his parable of the &quot;Three Arrows&quot;, which explains the importance of clan unity. In his first battle, the Battle of Arita-Nakaide in 1517, he defeated the overwhelming majority of the Aki-Takeda clan with a small force, which later became known as the &quot;Battle of Okehazama in the West&quot; as a battle in which a small force defeated a large army. Motonari became head of the Mōri clan in 1523 at the age of 27. The Amago and Ōuchi clans were sharing power in the Chūgoku region at the time, and he switched the Mōri clan&#x27;s allegiance from the Amago to the Ōuchi clan in 1525. Motonari destroyed the Takahashi clan by 1535 and ruled Aki province, Iwami province, and Bingo province, and destroyed the Aki-Takeda clan at the Siege of Koriyama in 1541. Motonaga adopted his sons into the Kikkawa clan and Kobayakawa clans to expand the power of the Mōri clan, and the three clans cooperated with each other. In 1554, Motonaga became independent of the Ōuchi clan, and after inciting the Ōuchi clan to internal divisions through political maneuvering, he defeated Sue Harukata, who had been in control of the Ōuchi clan, at the Battle of Itsukushima in 1555, and defeated Ōuchi Yoshinaga in 1557, destroying the Ōuchi clan and pacifying Nagato and Suou provinces.
Motonari destroyed the Amago clan at the Siege of Gassantoda Castle in 1567, and then pacified Izumo, Oki, and Hōki provinces, thus pacifying the Chūgoku region, and later extended his power to parts of Shikoku. He died in 1571 at the age of 75.

====Hokuriku, Kantō, and Chūbu regions (Uesugi Kenshin)====

In 1546, Hōjō Ujiyasu defeated Uesugi Tomosada at the Siege of Kawagoe Castle, and the Later Hōjō clan established its power in the Kantō region.

Uesugi Kenshin (Nagao Kagetora) was a &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; based in Echigo Province who fought various &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; and increased his power through aggressive invasions. After unifying Echigo in 1551, he invaded the Kantō region several times from 1552 to 1569 and fought against Hōjō Ujiyasu. He also invaded the territory of Takeda Shingen, who ruled Kai and Shinano Provinces from 1553 to 1573, and fought in the Battle of Kawanakajima five times between 1553 and 1564. In 1559, Kenshin had an audience with Emperor Ōgimachi and the 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru. When Imagawa Yoshimoto was killed by Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Okehazama in 1560, the Alliance Kai-Sagami-Suruga formed in 1554 between Takeda Shingen in Kai, Hojo Ujiyasu in Sagami, and Imagawa Yoshimoto in Suruga was broken. Kenshin used this as an opportunity to seize Hojo Ujiyasu&#x27;s territories one by one, and cornered the Later Hōjō clan at the Siege of Odawara in 1561, but was unable to defeat them. On his return from the Siege of Odawara, he performed a ceremony at the Tsurugaoka Hachimangū and assumed the position of &quot;kantō kanrei&quot;. Kenshin made peace with Hōjō Ujiyasu, who ceded part of his territory to him in 1569, and made Takeda Shingen a common enemy of Kenshin and Ujiyasu, but Shingen died of illness in 1573. After Takeda Shingen&#x27;s death, he fell out with Oda Nobunaga and destroyed the Noto Hatakeyama clan, which was close to Nobunaga, at the Siege of Nanao in 1577, pacifying Noto Province. He then defeated Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Tedorigawa. However, he died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1578 at the young age of 49.

=== Social changes with the advent of matchlock guns ===

When the Portuguese brought the matchlock gun to Japan in 1543, it was mass-produced in Japan, and a gun called the &quot;tanegashima&quot; began to be used in wars. With the introduction of guns, a standing army of became essential to victory in war, making it impossible for small local lords to remain independent, and lands were consolidated under &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; with vast territories, and battles between &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; became more intense.

During this period, the organized use of large numbers of &quot;tanegashima&quot; (guns) was essential to winning the war. In order for the &quot;daimyo&quot; to win the war, they had to secure a large number of gunsmiths and arms dealers, import large quantities of lead, the raw material for bullets, and nitre, the raw material for gunpowder, conduct routine marksmanship training, and secure large quantities of materials for building war positions. It was Oda Nobunaga who did this most successfully. He built Azuchi Castle at a strategic distribution point, brought several gunsmithing centers under his control, and established friendly relations with the Portuguese and merchants in Sakai, which had become an international port. He examined the rice yields of the lands under his control and did not allow his retainers to take private ownership of the lands, leaving the management of the lands to his retainers. This made it possible to efficiently change territories according to the performance of the vassals, thus eliminating land disputes. In addition, he made it possible to form a standing army by assigning military service to each region according to rice production. He encouraged the economic activities of the common people. In this way, he rapidly increased his power.

===Oda Nobunaga===

In and around the Kinai, the most politically important region in Japan, Oda Nobunaga allied with Tokugawa Ieyasu to increase his power. Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto at the Battle of Okehazama in 1560 and moved to Kyoto in 1568 to support the 15th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki. Nobunaga defeated Miyoshi Yoshitsugu in 1569, laid siege to Mount Hiei in 1571, defeated Asakura Yoshikage at the Siege of Ichijōdani Castle in 1573, defeated Asai Nagamasa at the Siege of Odani Castle in the same year, and expelled Ashikaga Yoshiaki from Kyoto in 1573, thus destroying the Ashikaga shogunate. He overpowered the Nagashima ikko ikki in 1574, defeated Takeda Katsuyori at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, and defeated Ishiyama Hongan-ji in the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War in 1580. However, he was betrayed by his vassal Akechi Mitsuhide, who drove him to suicide in the Honnō-ji Incident of 1582.

At the same time, the Mōri clan overthrew the Ouchi clan in the Chūgoku region, and the Shimazu and Otomo clans became major powers in Kyushu. In this way, regional unification was promoted.

=== Toyotomi (Hashiba) Hideyoshi ===

Though a peasant by birth, Toyotomi Hideyoshi had risen through the ranks of , samurai, and &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; under Nobunaga to become the most capable general of them all. When he learned that his lord Nobunaga had been effectively killed by Akechi Mitsuhide, he immediately made peace with the Mōri clan, who were in the midst of a battle, and turned his army back faster than anyone could have predicted, defeating Akechi Mitsuhide at the Battle of Yamazaki. Hideyoshi avenged his lord&#x27;s death only 11 days after Nobunaga&#x27;s death. The men who had been Nobunaga&#x27;s chief vassals discussed future policy at the Kiyosu Conference, and Hideyoshi began his path to becoming Nobunaga&#x27;s successor. In 1582, Hideyoshi defeated Shibata Katsuie and Oda Nobutaka, who had been enemies over Nobunaga&#x27;s succession, at the Battle of Shizugatake, and in 1583 he began construction of Osaka Castle. In 1584, he fought bitterly against the allied forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobuo at the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, but was able to make a truce with Nobuo by making peace with him. In 1585, he defeated Chōsokabe Motochika in an Invasion of Shikoku and pacified Shikoku. In 1586, he became and for the first time in history, although he was not a native-born aristocrat. In 1586, he also succeeded in getting Ieyasu to swear allegiance to him. In 1587, he defeated the Shimazu clan in a Kyūshū campaign and pacified Kyūshū. In 1590, he defeated the Later Hōjō clan in the Siege of Odawara and pacified the Kantō region. In the same year, he forced the clans of the Tōhoku region to swear allegiance to him and finally achieved the unification of Japan.

==== Tōhoku region (Date Masamune) ====

Date Masamune was a one-eyed warlord, a famous &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; who is often said to have had the potential to unite the country if only he had been born 20 years earlier. He became the head of the Date clan in 1584, two years after the death of Oda Nobunaga, destroyed the Nihonmatsu clan and other clans, and then in 1589, at the Battle of Suriagehara, defeated the Ashina clan to conquer the Aizu province, and continued to expand his territory to conquer most of the Tōhoku region. On the other hand, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who had only the Kantō and Tōhoku regions left to unify Japan, enacted a law called the in 1587, which prohibited &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; from waging war against each other, and Masamune&#x27;s conquest of the Tōhoku region was a serious violation of this law. After destroying the Later Hōjō clan at the Siege of Odawara, Hideyoshi wanted to destroy the Date clan and other &quot;sengoku daimyo&quot; in the Tōhoku region who were reluctant to show their deference. Hideyoshi had his subordinate Maeda Toshiie question Masamune, who had arrived late to give the order to participate in the Siege of Odawara, but after hearing Masamune&#x27;s bold attitude, he decided to meet with Masamune. Masamune showed his reverence by appearing before Hideyoshi in a pure white death robe, ready to be executed. Hideyoshi placed his staff on Masamune&#x27;s neck and said, &quot;If you had come a little later, you would have been beheaded,&quot; and Masamune pledged his reverence to Hideyoshi. He did not lose his life, only some of his territory was confiscated. He was later interrogated by Hideyoshi on suspicion of inciting a peasant uprising and participating in the rebellion of Toyotomi Hidetsugu, but he defended himself with his usual courage and dignity and was not punished.

He was on the side of Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara, and as the first lord of the Sendai domain during the Edo period, he developed Sendai and laid the foundations of the city as the center of the present-day Tōhoku region. In 1613, he sent Hasekura Tsunenaga as an ambassador to Europe, where he was granted an audience with the Pope Paul V.

=== Events ===
==&quot;Gekokujō&quot;==

The upheaval resulted in the further weakening of central authority, and throughout Japan, regional lords, called &quot;daimyōs&quot;, rose to fill the vacuum. In the course of this power shift, well-established clans such as the Takeda and the Imagawa, who had ruled under the authority of both the Kamakura and Muromachi &quot;bakufu&quot;, were able to expand their spheres of influence. There were many, however, whose positions eroded and were eventually usurped by more capable underlings. This phenomenon of social meritocracy, in which capable subordinates rejected the status quo and forcefully overthrew an emancipated aristocracy, became known as , which means &quot;low conquers high&quot;.

One of the earliest instances of this was Hōjō Sōun, who rose from relatively humble origins and eventually seized power in Izu Province in 1493. Building on the accomplishments of Sōun, the Hōjō clan remained a major power in the Kantō region until its subjugation by Toyotomi Hideyoshi late in the Sengoku period. Other notable examples include the supplanting of the Hosokawa clan by the Miyoshi, the Toki by the Saitō, and the Shiba clan by the Oda clan, which was in turn replaced by its underling, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a son of a peasant with no family name.

Well-organized religious groups also gained political power at this time by uniting farmers in resistance and rebellion against the rule of the &quot;daimyōs&quot;. The monks of the Buddhist True Pure Land sect formed numerous &quot;Ikkō-ikki&quot;, the most successful of which, in Kaga Province, remained independent for nearly 100 years.

<text>Aguadilla (, ), founded in 1775 by Luis de Córdova, is a city and municipality located in the northwestern tip of Puerto Rico, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, north of Aguada, and Moca and west of Isabela. Aguadilla is spread over 15 &quot;barrios&quot; and Aguadilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city and core of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area. This region was already inhabited and known as Aguadilla before 1770. Nevertheless, according to Dr. Agustín Stahl in his &quot;Foundation of Aguadilla&quot;, it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in 1775.

== Etymology and nicknames ==

Aguadilla is a shortening of the town&#x27;s original name &quot;San Carlos de La Aguadilla&quot;. The name &quot;Aguadilla&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;Aguada&quot;, which is the name of the town and municipality located to the south. Some of the municipality&#x27;s nicknames are: &quot;Jardín del Atlántico&quot; (&quot;Garden of the Atlantic&quot;), &quot;Pueblo de los Tiburones&quot; (&quot;Shark Town&quot;) and &quot;La Villa del Ojo de Agua&quot; (&quot;Villa of the Water Spring&quot;) after the natural water spring that was used by early settlers and Spanish soldiers as a water source which is now located in El Parterre Square in Aguadilla Pueblo.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian settlements and foundation===
According to sources, a Taíno settlement called &quot;Aymamón&quot; was located close to the Culebrinas River.

The present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of Aguada. Movement towards creating a separate municipality began as early as 1736. A resident of Aguada named Pedro de Arce wrote about the matter to the Spanish crown. In this document, widespread enthusiasm among the residents of the Aguadilla barrio in support for the idea is claimed. However, a strong opposition emerged from their neighbors in other areas of Aguada. This conflict stalled the process for decades. The first advances came in the form of a small chapel being built in 1770. Two years later, the community hosted influential Spanish politicians Luis de Córdova and Miguel de Muesas. Their host, Bernardo Sosa, and several neighbors requested them to lobby in favor of their request before peninsular authorities.

In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla was approved by Córdova, with Sosa as the town&#x27;s first mayor. Following the celebrations, a larger Church began being built. In 1776, Fray Íñigo Abbad y Lasierra in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the &quot;new Town of San Carlos de La Aguadilla.&quot;

But it was not until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official. Originally, Aguadilla was constituted by the Victoria and Higüey barrios. The population in the town of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when Santo Domingo became independent for the first time, the loyalists of Spanish descent emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly.

===19th Century, becoming a Loyal Village===
The early decades of the 19th Century brought with them several incidents that were a hindrance to the town economy, beginning with a large scale fire that destroyed most of the houses and had lasting repercussions. In 1825, hurricane Santa Ana struck Puerto Rico, destroying most of Aguadilla&#x27;s orange farms. In 1831, according to Don Pedro Tomás de Córdova, the area or &quot;party&quot; of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Montaña, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Higüey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual.

Don Pedro Tomás de Córdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the &quot;anchorage of the ships that travel from Europe to Havana and Mexico&quot;. He adds that its &quot;port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.&quot; San Antonio community was established in the mid-19th century. It was populated by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as &quot;Bajura de Vadi&quot;, the place later to become known as San Antonio. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla.

In 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a village (“villa leal”) by Queen Isabela II, with all the benefits associated with it. Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, Isabela, Lares, Moca, Rincón, and San Sebastián. A municipal cemetery was inaugurated in 1804, but its space was limited by 1873. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Higüey, and Mangual barrios are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas barrio appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new barrios are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1893, hurricane San Roque brought devastation to the village&#x27;s plantation and destroyed some houses.

===Following the Spanish-American War===

Following the change of sovereignty over the island in 1898, the territorial organization of Aguadilla remained unchanged in comparison to 1878. A series of natural disasters would impact the town. In 1899, hurricane San Ciriaco passed over Puerto Rico, causing widespread destruction everywhere, including Aguadilla. In the Census held that year, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Higüey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo barrios. Malezas barrio appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. The 1918 San Fermín earthquake, and the tsunami that followed, directly impacted Aguadilla, killing 40 and damaging or destroying several landmarks including the church and town hall. San Antonio was completely destroyed by the tsunami, due to its proximity to the shore. The residents of the community decided to re-localize to a higher area further from shore.

Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as &quot;Luz del Porvenir&quot; (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival. The clothing industry was a major source of employment. In 1925, the District Hospital was inaugurated, later becoming known as “El Distrito”. After the Pedro J. Zamora Hospital opened in 1976, this facility became a private school.
On the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the worst railroad accident in its history. Train No. 3 was traveling from San Juan to Ponce carrying passengers to their different hometowns for the island general elections to be held that same day. It stopped at the Jiménez Station in Aguadilla for a routine engineer and boilerman exchange with Train No. 4 which was heading to San Juan. The engineer assigned to Train No. 3&#x27;s ride from Jiménez Station to Ponce was José Antonio Román, an experienced freight train engineer who had never worked in passenger travel. When the train left the station at
2:00 am, it was carrying 6 passenger cars with hundreds of commuters and two freight cars.
At 2:20 a.m. the train started to descend a hill section known as &quot;Cuesta Vieja&quot; (Old Hill) in Aguadilla at, what some witnesses described as, an exaggerated speed. When the train reached the leveling-off point at the bottom of the hill it derailed. The steam locomotive crashed into a ditch where it exploded and one of the freight cars crashed into one of the passenger cars, killing many inside and injuring several. Witnesses described the scene as horrendous, with some accounts stating that parents were throwing their children out the windows to save them from the wreckage. Chief of Police Guillermo Arroyo stated that the locomotive (No. 72), the express car, and three second class passenger cars were completely destroyed. Oscar Valle, an Aguadilla correspondent to &quot;El Mundo&quot; newspaper, summarized the scene with: &quot;The locomotive suffered a terrible explosion as it derailed, and the impact was so strong that 3 passenger cars were converted into a fantastic mound of wreckage&quot;. In the end, 16 passengers lost their lives, including the engineer and the boilerman, and 50 were injured in the crash.

The territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Planning, Urbanization, and Zoning Board prepared the map of the city and its barrios, and following instructions of city authorities, Higüey and parts of Caimital Alto barrios are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla. During that decade, there had been a territorial dispute with Aguada, when that municipality claimed that the area belonging to Parque Colón was on their side of the Culebrinas river. The matter became contentious when a diversion was made of the original route in 1931, with Aguada mayor Julio César Román basing its complain on Law 60-1945, preparing a memorial with historical maps and other documents supporting its position that the old geographic divisions remained, which was presented before the board on
September 20, 1946. The municipality alleged that taxes had been paid over these terrains, which Aguadilla refuted by claiming that adequate corrections had taken place. The agency called for public hearings and a visual inspection, but emphasized that it had the sole jurisdiction to decide the outcome. A historical report was commissioned to Adolfo de Hostos, the Puerto Rico Government&#x27;s Historian. The matter was contentious enough that it attracted parties from other places, such as a physician from Rio Piedras named Carlos González, who supported Aguada&#x27;s claim. The Board ruled that Parque Colón belonged to Aguada, with mayor Alfredo González Pérez appealing the decision. Ultimately, Aguadilla prevailed and the contentious area remained in its jurisdiction.

===Militarization during the Cold War===
In September 1939, some covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as Ramey Air Force Base. San Antonio&#x27;s ambitions to become a separate town were unfruitful, and the community suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to Ramey. In the process, Roberto Román Acevedo designed a town flag and emblem for the ostensible project. Aguadilla hosted these facilities for almost five decades. During this period, Aguadilla was home to the Strategic Air Command, equipped with RB-36s and 72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy equipped with B-52s, an important strategic facility during the Cold War.

Activated in June 1952 as a Strategic Air Command very long-range reconnaissance unit at Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico, but not operational until October 1952. Redesignated as 72d Strategic Reconnaissance Wing and received 3 (60th, 73rd and 301st) squadrons of RB-36D/E/F/H Peacemaker bombers. Also, the 915th Air Rescue Squadron. Conducted global strategic reconnaissance 1953–1955, gradually shifting to a bombardment training mission beginning in 1954, being upgraded to B-36J and B-36J(III) Featherweights by 1955. Redesignated 72d Bombardment Wing in 1958.
With the phaseout of the B-36s in 1958, received B-52G Stratofortress intercontinental strategic bombers.

The town&#x27;s urban center was reformatted, with a new plaza named after Federico Degetau y González being inaugurated on September 30, 1955. In 1971, Aguadilla lost its spot as Senatorial District Head following an electoral reform that included it in the new Mayagüez-Aguadilla District. During that decade, the municipality emphasized industry, with a facility that fabricated aviation parts being established at the base&#x27;s hangars in 1979. Five years earlier, an agreement to establish a DeLorean Motor Company plant at Calero was publicly announced, but the facility was ultimately built at Northern Ireland. The municipality&#x27;s main tourist site, Hotel Montemar was reworked into Parador Montemar.

Though the military infrastructure still exists, the airport was handed over to the Government of Puerto Rico in 1973. The aerial facilities are now controlled by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and comprise the Rafael Hernández International Airport. The barracks now host the Faro Inn Suites, a 79-room hotel. The Officer&#x27;s Club now hosts the Faro Conference Center, a meeting facility. The hospital is now the Courtyard by Marriott Punta Borinquen Resort &amp; Casino, a 150-room hotel with a casino and the first Marriott in Puerto Rico outside of the San Juan Metropolitan Area.

The area which formerly housed Ramey also hosts the University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla and the Friedrich Froebel Bilingual School (K-9). The high school became Ramey Job Corps Campus and the elementary school became the Esther Feliciano Mendoza Middle School. Centro de Adiestramiento y Bellas Artes (CABA) since 1979 has been the only public school of arts in Puerto Rico (7–12). Ramey is also the site of the Ramey Skating Park and a new &quot;mariposario&quot; (butterfly farm) and the Ramey Shopping Center.

By 1980, the population of Agadilla had risen to more than 54,600 residents, most of which lived in the urban areas of the municipality. There is still an active part of the base that hosts the Coast Guard Borinquen Air Station. There are also other government agencies based at Ramey, including the United States Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs &amp; Border Protection&#x27;s Office of Air and Marine and Office of Border Patrol, the &quot;Fuerzas Unidas de Rápida Acción&quot; (United Forces for Rapid Action) of the Puerto Rico Police Department and the Puerto Rico National Guard. There is also a post office, the &quot;Centro de Servicios al Conductor&quot; (DMV), a bakery, and a Banco Popular de Puerto Rico location.

===Early 21st Century and Hurricane Maria===

Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, causing large-scale damage and destruction to infrastructure. In Aguadilla
10 inches
of rain were recorded and its more than 54,000 residents were left with no electrical power.

The four radar systems used by the Federal Aviation Administration for flights in and around Puerto Rico were damaged by Hurricane Maria, and it took nearly two weeks to fix them. One of the radar systems is located in Aguadilla.

===The 2020s===
In recent years, the town has gathered some international celebrity due to the release of a Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) footage captured by a Customs and Patrol aircraft near Rafael Hernández Airport on April 26, 2013, after the air traffic tower reported sighting a pinkish glowing orb flying near the facility. The 5-minute long thermal sequence was captured with a FLIR camera and released by the agency in September 2023, one of several acknowledged by the government as filmed by an official source since 2018, becoming colloquially known as “The Aguadilla UFO Incident”. Initially sent to Homeland Security for analysis, the film was then remitted to the Air Force before ultimately being released to civilian groups interested in the topic. The Scientific Coalition for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (SCU) has called it the &quot;most compelling&quot; footage of the anomalous aerial activity. Since then, the footage has been replayed in several shows covering fringe topics, mostly aired in network television such as the History Channel, National Geographic and Discovery Channel. Debate remains ongoing, with Chinese lanterns, drones, birds and balloons being proposed as potential explanations by skeptics.

In September 2024, the municipal government filed a lawsuit against private consortium LUMA Energy, citing collective losses related to the corporation&#x27;s mismanagement of the energy distribution system.

<doc id="84512" wikidata="Q61982" url="?curid=84512" title="Daimyo">
<text>were powerful Japanese magnates, feudal lords who, from the 10th century to the early Meiji period in the middle 19th century, ruled most of Japan from their vast hereditary land holdings. They were subordinate to the shogun and nominally to the emperor and the &quot;kuge&quot; (an aristocratic class). In the term, means &#x27;large&#x27;, and stands for , meaning &#x27;private land&#x27;.

From the &quot;shugo&quot; of the Muromachi period through the Sengoku period to the daimyo of the Edo period, the rank had a long and varied history. The backgrounds of daimyo also varied considerably; while some daimyo clans, notably the Mōri, Shimazu and Hosokawa, were cadet branches of the Imperial family or were descended from the &quot;kuge&quot;, other daimyo were promoted from the ranks of the samurai, notably during the Edo period.

Daimyo often hired samurai to guard their land, and paid them in land or food, as relatively few could afford to pay them in money. The daimyo era ended soon after the Meiji Restoration, with the adoption of the prefecture system in 1871.

==&quot;Shugo-daimyō&quot;==
The were the first group of men to hold the title &quot;daimyō&quot;. They arose from among the &quot;shugo&quot; during the Muromachi period (approximately 1336–1573). The &quot;shugo-daimyo&quot; held not only military and police powers, but also economic power within a province. They accumulated these powers throughout the first decades of the Muromachi period.

Major &quot;shugo-daimyō&quot; came from the Shiba, Hatakeyama, and Hosokawa clans, as well as the tozama clans of Yamana, Ōuchi, Takeda and Akamatsu. The greatest ruled multiple provinces.

The Ashikaga shogunate required the &quot;shugo-daimyō&quot; to reside in Kyoto, so they appointed relatives or retainers, called &quot;shugodai&quot;, to represent them in their home provinces. Eventually, some of these in turn came to reside in Kyoto, appointing deputies in the provinces.

The Ōnin War was a major uprising in which &quot;shugo-daimyō&quot; fought each other. During this and other wars of the time, &quot;kuni ikki&quot;, or provincial uprisings, took place as locally powerful warriors sought independence from the &quot;shugo-daimyo&quot;. The deputies of the &quot;shugo-daimyō&quot;, living in the provinces, seized the opportunity to strengthen their position. At the end of the fifteenth century, those &quot;shugo-daimyō&quot; who succeeded remained in power. Those who had failed to exert control over their deputies fell from power and were replaced by a new class, the &quot;sengoku-daimyō&quot;, who arose from the ranks of the &quot;shugodai&quot; and &quot;jizamurai&quot;.

==&quot;Sengoku-daimyo&quot;==

Among the were many who had been &quot;shugo-daimyō&quot;, such as the Satake, Imagawa, Takeda, Toki, Rokkaku, Ōuchi, and Shimazu. New to the ranks of the daimyo were the Asakura, Amago, Nagao, Miyoshi, Chōsokabe, Hatano, and Oda. These came from the ranks of the &quot;shugodai&quot; and their deputies.

Additional &quot;sengoku-daimyō&quot; such as the Mōri, Tamura, and Ryūzōji arose from the &quot;jizamurai&quot;. The lower officials of the shogunate and rōnin (Late Hōjō, Saitō), provincial officials (Kitabatake), and &quot;kuge&quot; (Tosa Ichijō) also gave rise to &quot;sengoku-daimyo&quot;.

==Edo period==
The Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 marked the beginning of the Edo period. &quot;Shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu reorganized roughly 200 daimyo and their territories into &quot;han,&quot; which were assessed by rice production. Those heading &quot;han&quot; assessed at 10,000 &quot;koku&quot; (50,000 bushels) or more were considered daimyo. Ieyasu also categorized the daimyo according to their relation to the ruling Tokugawa family: the &quot;shinpan&quot; were related to the Tokugawa; the &quot;fudai&quot; had been vassals of the Tokugawa or allies in battle; and the &quot;tozama&quot; had not allied with the Tokugawa before the Battle of Sekigahara (did not necessarily fight against the Tokugawa).

The &quot;shinpan&quot; were collaterals of Ieyasu, such as the Matsudaira, or descendants of Ieyasu other than in the main line of succession. Several &quot;shinpan&quot;, including the Tokugawa of Owari (Nagoya), Kii (Wakayama), and Mito, as well as the Matsudaira of Fukui and Aizu, held large &quot;han&quot;.

A few &quot;fudai daimyō&quot;, such as the Ii of Hikone, held large &quot;han,&quot; but many were small. The shogunate placed many &quot;fudai&quot; at strategic locations to guard the trade routes and the approaches to Edo. Also, many &quot;fudai daimyo&quot; took positions in the Edo shogunate, some rising to the position of &quot;rōjū.&quot; The fact that &quot;fudai daimyo&quot; could hold government positions, while &quot;tozama&quot; in general could not, was a main difference between the two.

&quot;Tozama daimyō&quot; held mostly large fiefs far away from the capital, with e.g. the Kaga &quot;han&quot; of Ishikawa Prefecture, headed by the Maeda clan, assessed at 1,000,000 &quot;koku&quot;. Other famous &quot;tozama&quot; clans included the Mori of Chōshū, the Shimazu of Satsuma, the Date of Sendai, the Uesugi of Yonezawa, and the Hachisuka of Awa. Initially, the Tokugawa regarded them as potentially rebellious, but for most of the Edo period, control policies such as &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot;, resulted in peaceful relations.

Daimyo were required to maintain residences in Edo as well as their fiefs, and to move periodically between Edo and their fiefs, typically spending alternate years in each place, in a practice called &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot;.

==After the Meiji Restoration==
In 1869, the year after the Meiji Restoration, the daimyo, together with the &quot;kuge,&quot; formed a new aristocracy, the &quot;kazoku&quot;. In 1871, the han were abolished, and prefectures were established. In this year, around 200 daimyo returned their titles to the emperor, who consolidated their han into 75 prefectures. Their military forces were also demobilized, with the daimyo and their samurai followers pensioned into retirement. The move to abolish the feudal domains effectively ended the daimyo era in Japan. This was effectively carried out through the financial collapse of the feudal-domain governments, hampering their capability for resistance.

In the wake of the changes, many daimyo remained in control of their lands, being appointed as prefectural governors; however, they were soon relieved of this duty and called en masse to Tokyo, thereby cutting off any independent base of power from which to potentially rebel.

Despite this, members of former daimyo families remained prominent in government and society, and in some cases continue to remain prominent to the present day. For example, Morihiro Hosokawa, the former Prime Minister of Japan, is a descendant of the daimyo of Kumamoto.

<doc id="84515" wikidata="Q1947367" url="?curid=84515" title="Murder in the Cathedral">
<text>Murder in the Cathedral is a verse drama by T. S. Eliot, first performed in 1935 (published the same year). The play portrays the assassination of Archbishop Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral during the reign of Henry II in 1170. Eliot drew heavily on the writing of Edward Grim, a clerk who was an eyewitness to the event.

Some material that the producer asked Eliot to remove or replace during the writing was transformed into the poem &quot;Burnt Norton&quot;.

==Plot==
The action occurs between 2 and 29 December 1170, chronicling the days leading up to the martyrdom of Thomas Becket following his absence of seven years in France. Becket&#x27;s internal struggle is a central focus of the play.

The book is divided into two parts. Part one takes place in the Archbishop Thomas Becket&#x27;s hall on 2 December 1170. The play begins with a Chorus singing, foreshadowing the coming violence. The Chorus is a key part of the drama, with its voice changing and developing during the play, offering comments about the action and providing a link between the audience and the characters and action, as in Greek drama. Three priests are present, and they reflect on the absence of Becket and the rise of temporal power. A herald announces Becket&#x27;s arrival. Becket is immediately reflective about his coming martyrdom, which he embraces, and which is understood to be a sign of his own selfishness—his fatal weakness. The tempters arrive, three of whom parallel the Temptations of Christ.

The first tempter offers the prospect of physical safety.
The second offers power, riches, and fame in serving the King.
The third tempter suggests a coalition with the barons and a chance to resist the King.
Finally, a fourth tempter urges him to seek the glory of martyrdom.
Becket responds to all of the tempters and specifically addresses the immoral suggestions of the fourth tempter at the end of the first act:

The Interlude of the play is a sermon given by Becket on Christmas morning 1170. It is about the strange contradiction that Christmas is a day both of mourning and rejoicing, which Christians also do for martyrs. He announces at the end of his sermon, &quot;it is possible that in a short time you may have yet another martyr&quot;. We see in the sermon something of Becket&#x27;s ultimate peace of mind, as he elects not to seek sainthood, but to accept his death as inevitable and part of a better whole.

Part II of the play takes place in the Archbishop&#x27;s Hall and in the cathedral, 29 December 1170. Four knights arrive with &quot;Urgent business&quot; from the king. These knights had heard the king speak of his frustration with Becket and had interpreted this as an order to kill Becket. They accuse him of betrayal, and he claims to be loyal. He tells them to accuse him in public, and they make to attack him, but priests intervene. The priests insist that he leave and protect himself, but he refuses. The knights leave and Becket again says he is ready to die. The chorus sings that they knew this conflict was coming, that it had long been in the fabric of their lives, both temporal and spiritual. The chorus again reflects on the coming devastation. Thomas is taken to the cathedral, where the knights break in and kill him. The chorus laments: &quot;Clear the air! Clean the sky!&quot;, and &quot;The land is foul, the water is foul, our beasts and ourselves defiled with blood.&quot;

At the close of the play, the knights address the audience to defend their actions. While the rest of the play is in verse, their speeches of justification are in strikingly contemporary prose. They assert that while they understand their actions will be seen as murder, it was necessary and justified, so that the power of the church should not undermine the stability of the state.

==Performances==
===First performance===
George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester, was instrumental in getting Eliot to work as writer with producer E. Martin Browne in producing the pageant play &quot;The Rock&quot; (1934). Bell then asked Eliot to write another play for the Canterbury Festival in 1935. Eliot agreed to do so if Browne once again produced (he did). The first performance of &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot; was given on 15 June 1935 in the Chapter House of Canterbury Cathedral. Robert Speaight played the part of Becket. The production then moved to the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate in London and ran there for several months. In 1947 it was performed by Pilgrim Players at the Gateway Theatre, Leith Walk in the first Edinburgh Festival Fringe. A significant performance of the play was held on 15 February 2018. Nithin Varghese, an assistant professor at St Berchmans College in Changanassery, directed the play for the first time in Kerala. This performance was part of the golden jubilee celebration of the postgraduate program in English at the college. The play was staged on the outdoor stage located in front of the Arts Block, and received positive recognition from the audience for its adherence to T. S. Eliot&#x27;s original text.

===Television and film===

The play, starring Robert Speaight, was broadcast live on British television by the BBC in 1936, during its first few months of broadcasting TV.

The play was later made into a black and white film with the same title. It was directed by the Austrian director George Hoellering with music by the Hungarian composer Laszlo Lajtha and won the Grand Prix at the Venice Film Festival in 1951. It was released in the UK in 1952. In the film the fourth tempter is not seen. His voice was that of Eliot himself. Hoellering wrote that &quot;in stage productions [the knights&#x27; final] speeches amused the audience instead of shocking them, and thereby made them miss the point—the whole point of the play.&quot; In light of this, he asked Eliot for changes; and Eliot made major reductions to the speeches and added a shorter speech.

It was filmed by the ABC in 1962.

===Opera===
The play is the basis for the opera &quot;Assassinio nella cattedrale&quot; by the Italian composer Ildebrando Pizzetti, first performed at La Scala, Milan, in 1958.

===Recordings===

Full-cast recordings of the play include the following, with the actor playing Becket.

* 1938 Reynolds Evans by &quot;Columbia Workshop&quot; (abridged for radio)
* 1953 Robert Donat by Angel Records 
* 1968 Paul Scofield by Caedmon Records
* 1976 Richard Pasco of The Royal Shakespeare Company by Argo Records
* 1988 Peter Barkworth by BBC Radio 4 broadcast

==Criticism by Eliot==

In 1951, in the first Theodore Spencer Memorial Lecture at Harvard University, Eliot criticised his own plays in the second half of the lecture, explicitly the plays &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot;, &quot;The Family Reunion&quot;, and &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot;. The lecture was published as &quot;Poetry and Drama&quot; and later included in Eliot&#x27;s 1957 collection &quot;On Poetry and Poets&quot;.

==Parodies==
In Series 3, episode 2 (1972), &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; used the play as the basis for the weight loss product informercial, Trim-Jeans Theater:

In 1982, the play was lampooned by the Canadian/US TV comedy show &quot;SCTV.&quot; In a typically surreal SCTV sketch, the play is presented by NASA and &quot;Buzz Aldrin&#x27;s Mercury III Players,&quot; with space-suited astronauts as the actors, and proceedings narrated by Walter Cronkite as if they were a NASA Moon mission. &quot;[Spacesuit transmission from astronaut] Mission control ... I think we&#x27;ve found a body.&quot; The mission is aborted when the doors of the cathedral will not open, and not even Becket&#x27;s Extra-vehicular activity can open them.

<doc id="84517" wikidata="Q1929263" url="?curid=84517" title="Ocnus">
<text>In Greek and Roman mythology, Ocnus () or Bianor () was a son of Manto and Tiberinus Silvius, king of Alba Longa. He founded modern Mantua in honor of his mother. Alternatively, he was the son or brother of Aulestes and founded Felsina (modern Bologna), Perusia or Cesena.

Because of the association of his name with the Greek verb () , Ocnus is a character or allegorical deity which personifies hesitation, frustration, delay and the wasting of time, thus symbolising the vicissitudes of human life consumed in unsuccessful efforts.

==Mythology==
He was condemned to spend eternity in Tartarus, weaving a rope of straw. As depicted in the picture by Polygnotos, standing behind him is his donkey which eats the rope as fast as it is made.

Unlike as it is the case with other inmates of Tartarus, there is no crime mentioned which would explain Ocnus&#x27;s condition. The classical philologist and epigraphist Reinhold Merkelbach suggests that this is the case because Ocnus had been &quot;tardy&quot; in seeking initiation in the Eleusinian Mysteries, but there is no direct evidence for this in the surviving literary resources. The classical philologist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff regards Ocnus&#x27;s condition as a punishment for moral weakness, lack of courage, and shyness towards what he conceives as obligation to make up his mind. According to Wilamowitz, this might have good effects if it keeps away from evil deeds, but is egoistic because the avoidance of obstacles which require a decision to act basically helps no one. The philosopher Norbert Wokart however rejects this notion, and deems Ocnus to be just a picture or mere symbol, which allegorically shows the creative and destructive, and abstractly the fragile balance between the positive and the negative, because the positive would only become positive through the contrast of the negative.

Julius Evola, an Italian esotericist, posits the story as a symbolic representation of the birth and death of man as a form of incidental immortality, circumventing the individual. Here, Evola sees Ocnus as the eternal-mother, weaving the unending rope of humanity down into the mouth of the donkey, which symbolizes death

<doc id="84519" wikidata="Q878527" url="?curid=84519" title="Tiberinus Silvius">
<text>Tiberinus (said to have reigned 922-914 BC) was the ninth king of Alba Longa, according to the traditional history of Rome handed down by Titus Livius. He was the successor (and probably son) of Capetus, the eighth king of Alba Longa. The Alban kings claimed descent from Aeneas, a Trojan prince who brought a remnant of the Trojan populace to Italy following the sack of Troy (traditionally 1184 BC), and settled in Latium. Alba was built by Ascanius, the son of Aeneas and Lavinia, and founder of the Alban royal line. The Alban kings, including Tiberinus, bore the &quot;cognomen&quot; Silvius, after the son of Ascanius, who was said to have been born in the woods.

The only tradition specifically attached to Tiberinus is that he was drowned while crossing the river then known as the &quot;Albula&quot;, but which was ever after known to the Latins as the Tiber. This ancient river formed the boundary of Latium and Etruria, and the city of Rome was later founded on a group of seven hills overlooking its banks. After his death, Tiberinus was revered as the god of the river (see Tiberinus (god)). In the earliest days of Rome, the cult of Tiberinus survived at the Volturnalia, the archaic festival of Volturnus, but no details are known.

Tiberinus was succeeded by Agrippa, the tenth king of Alba Longa, and probably his son. Amongst their descendants were Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome (traditionally 753 BC).

Many scholars believe that the name of Tiberinus was derived from the river, instead of the other way around. The same root is thought to be the origin of the Latin &quot;praenomen Tiberius&quot;, and its Etruscan cognate, &quot;Thefarie&quot;, and it may be noted that &quot;Tiberinus&quot; appears to be derived from &quot;Tiberius&quot;, which may have been the original form of the name. Philologist George Davis Chase believed that the same root might be found in the names of the city of Tibur, the Umbrian town of Tifernum, and the Samnite river Tifernus.

<text>In Greek mythology, Tethys (; ) was a Titan daughter of Uranus and Gaia, a sister and wife of the Titan Oceanus, and the mother of the river gods and the Oceanids. Although Tethys had no active role in Greek mythology and no established cults, she was depicted in mosaics decorating baths, pools, and triclinia in the Greek East, particularly in Antioch and its suburbs, either alone or with Oceanus.

==Genealogy==
Tethys was one of the Titan offspring of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth). Hesiod lists her Titan siblings as Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, and Cronus. Tethys married her brother Oceanus, an enormous river encircling the world, and was by him the mother of numerous sons (the river gods) and numerous daughters (the Oceanids).

According to Hesiod, there were three thousand (i.e. innumerable) river gods. These included Achelous, the god of the Achelous River, the largest river in Greece, who gave his daughter in marriage to Alcmaeon and was defeated by Heracles in a wrestling contest for the right to marry Deianira; Alpheus, who fell in love with the nymph Arethusa and pursued her to Syracuse, where she was transformed into a spring by Artemis; and Scamander who fought on the side of the Trojans during the Trojan War and, offended when Achilles polluted his waters with a large number of Trojan corpses, overflowed his banks nearly drowning Achilles.

According to Hesiod, there were also three thousand Oceanids. These included Metis, Zeus&#x27; first wife, whom Zeus impregnated with Athena and then swallowed; Eurynome, Zeus&#x27; third wife, and mother of the Charites; Doris, the wife of Nereus and mother of the Nereids; Callirhoe, the wife of Chrysaor and mother of Geryon; Clymene, the wife of Iapetus, and mother of Atlas, Menoetius, Prometheus, and Epimetheus; Perseis, wife of Helios and mother of Circe and Aeetes; Idyia, wife of Aeetes and mother of Medea; and Styx, goddess of the river Styx, and the wife of Pallas and mother of Zelus, Nike, Kratos, and Bia.









===Primeval mother===
Passages in book 14 of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, called the Deception of Zeus, suggest the possibility that Homer knew a tradition in which Oceanus and Tethys (rather than Uranus and Gaia, as in Hesiod) were the primeval parents of the gods. Twice Homer has Hera describe the pair as &quot;Oceanus, from whom the gods are sprung, and mother Tethys&quot;. According to M. L. West, these lines suggests a myth in which Oceanus and Tethys are the &quot;first parents of the whole race of gods.&quot; However, as Timothy Gantz points out, &quot;mother&quot; could simply refer to the fact that Tethys was Hera&#x27;s foster mother for a time, as Hera tells us in the lines immediately following, while the reference to Oceanus as the genesis of the gods &quot;might be simply a formulaic epithet indicating the numberless rivers and springs descended from Okeanos&quot; (compare with &quot;Iliad&quot; 21.195–197). But, in a later &quot;Iliad&quot; passage, Hypnos also describes Oceanus as &quot;&quot;genesis&quot; for all&quot;, which, according to Gantz, is hard to understand as meaning other than that, for Homer, Oceanus was the father of the Titans.

Plato, in his &quot;Timaeus&quot;, provides a genealogy (probably Orphic) which perhaps reflected an attempt to reconcile this apparent divergence between Homer and Hesiod, in which Uranus and Gaia are the parents of Oceanus and Tethys, and Oceanus and Tethys are the parents of Cronus and Rhea and the other Titans, as well as Phorcys. In his &quot;Cratylus&quot;, Plato quotes Orpheus as saying that Oceanus and Tethys were &quot;the first to marry&quot;, possibly also reflecting an Orphic theogony in which Oceanus and Tethys—rather than Uranus and Gaia—were the primeval parents. Plato&#x27;s apparent inclusion of Phorkys as a Titan (being the brother of Cronus and Rhea), and the mythographer Apollodorus&#x27;s inclusion of Dione, the mother of Aphrodite by Zeus, as a thirteenth Titan, suggests an Orphic tradition in which Hesiod&#x27;s twelve Titans were the offspring of Oceanus and Tethys, with Phorkys and Dione taking the place of Oceanus and Tethys.

According to Epimenides, the first two beings, Night and Aer, produced Tartarus, who in turn produced two Titans (possibly Oceanus and Tethys) from whom came the world egg.

==Mythology==
Tethys played no active part in Greek mythology. The only early story concerning Tethys is what Homer has Hera briefly relate in the &quot;Iliad&quot;’s Deception of Zeus passage. There, Hera says that when Zeus was in the process of deposing Cronus, she was given by her mother Rhea to Tethys and Oceanus for safekeeping and that they &quot;lovingly nursed and cherished me in their halls&quot;. Hera relates this while dissembling that she is on her way to visit Oceanus and Tethys in the hopes of reconciling her foster parents, who are angry with each other and are no longer having sexual relations.

Originally Oceanus&#x27; consort, at a later time Tethys came to be identified with the sea, and in Hellenistic and Roman poetry Tethys&#x27; name came to be used as a poetic term for the sea.

The only other story involving Tethys is an apparently late astral myth concerning the polar constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear), which was thought to represent the catasterism of Callisto who was transformed into a bear and placed by Zeus among the stars. The myth explains why the constellation never sets below the horizon, saying that since Callisto had been Zeus&#x27;s lover, she was forbidden by Tethys from &quot;touching Ocean&#x27;s deep&quot; out of concern for her foster-child Hera, Zeus&#x27;s jealous wife.

Claudian wrote that Tethys nursed two of her nephlings in her breast, Helios and Selene, the children of her siblings Hyperion and Theia, during their infancy, when their light was weak and had not yet grown into their older, more luminous selves.

In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Tethys turns Aesacus into a diving bird.

Tethys was sometimes confused with another sea goddess, the sea-nymph Thetis, wife of Peleus and mother of Achilles.

== Tethys as Tiamat ==
M. L. West detects in the &quot;Iliad&quot;&#x27;s Deception of Zeus passage an allusion to a possible archaic myth &quot;according to which [Tethys] was the mother of the gods, long estranged from her husband,&quot; speculating that the estrangement might refer to a separation of &quot;the upper and lower waters ... corresponding to that of heaven and earth,&quot; which parallels the story of &quot;Apsū and Tiamat in the Babylonian cosmology, the male and female waters, which were originally united (En. El. I. 1 ff.),&quot; but that, &quot;By Hesiod&#x27;s time the myth may have been almost forgotten and Tethys remembered only as the name of Oceanus&#x27; wife.&quot; This possible correspondence between Oceanus and Tethys, and Apsū and Tiamat has been noticed by several authors, with Tethys&#x27; name possibly having been derived from that of Tiamat.

==Iconography==
Representations of Tethys before the Roman period are rare.
Tethys appears, identified by inscription (ΘΕΘΥΣ), as part of an illustration of the wedding of Peleus and Thetis on the early sixth-century BC Attic black-figure &quot;Erskine&quot; dinos by Sophilos (British Museum 1971.111–1.1). Accompanied by Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, Tethys follows close behind Oceanus at the end of a procession of gods invited to the wedding. Tethys is also conjectured to be represented in a similar illustration of the wedding of Peleus and Thetis depicted on the early sixth-century BC Attic black-figure François Vase (Florence 4209). Tethys probably also appeared as one of the gods fighting the Giants in the Gigantomachy frieze of the second-century BC Pergamon Altar. Only fragments of the figure remain: a part of a chiton below Oceanus&#x27; left arm and a hand clutching a large tree branch visible behind Oceanus&#x27; head.

During the second to fourth centuries AD, Tethys—sometimes with Oceanus, sometimes alone—became a relatively frequent feature of mosaics decorating baths, pools, and triclinia in the Greek East, particularly in Antioch and its suburbs. Her identifying attributes are wings sprouting from her forehead, a rudder/oar, and a &quot;ketos&quot;, a creature from Greek mythology with the head of a dragon and the body of a snake. The earliest of these mosaics, identified as Tethys, decorated a triclinium overlooking a pool, excavated from the House of the Calendar in Antioch, dated to shortly after AD 115 (Hatay Archaeology Museum 850). Tethys, reclining on the left, with Oceanus reclining on the right, has long hair, a winged forehead, and is nude to the waist with draped legs. A &quot;ketos&quot; twines around her raised right arm. Other mosaics of Tethys with Oceanus include Hatay Archaeology Museum 1013 (from the House of Menander, Daphne), Hatay Archaeology Museum 9095, and Baltimore Museum of Art 1937.126 (from the House of the Boat of Psyches: triclinium).

In other mosaics, Tethys appears without Oceanus. One of these is a fourth-century AD mosaic from a pool (probably a public bath) found at Antioch, now installed in Boston, Massachusetts at the Harvard Business School&#x27;s Morgan Hall and formerly at Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, D.C. (Dumbarton Oaks 76.43). Besides the Sophilos dinos, this is the only other representation of Tethys identified by inscription. Here Tethys, with a winged forehead, rises from the sea bare-shouldered, with long dark hair parted in the middle. A golden rudder rests against her right shoulder. Others include Hatay Archaeology Museum 9097, Shahba Museum (&quot;in situ&quot;), Baltimore Museum of Art 1937.118 (from the House of the Boat of Psyches: Room six), and Memorial Art Gallery 42.2.

Toward the end of the period represented by these mosaics, Tethys&#x27; iconography appears to merge with that of another sea goddess Thalassa, the Greek personification of the sea (&quot;thalassa&quot; being the Greek word for the sea). Such a transformation would be consistent with the frequent use of Tethys&#x27; name as a poetic reference to the sea in Roman poetry (see above).

==Modern use of the name==
Tethys, a moon of the planet Saturn, and the prehistoric Tethys Ocean are named after this goddess.

<text>Tethys (), or Saturn III, is the fifth-largest moon of Saturn, measuring about across. It was discovered by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1684, and is named after the titan Tethys of Greek mythology.

Tethys has a low density of 0.98 g/cm3, the lowest of all the major moons in the solar system, indicating that it is made of water ice with just a small fraction of rock. This was confirmed by the spectroscopy of its surface, which identified water ice as the dominant surface material. A further, smaller amount of an unidentified dark material is present as well. The surface of Tethys is very bright, the second-brightest of the moons of Saturn after Enceladus, and neutral in color.

Tethys is heavily cratered and cut by a number of large faults and trench-like graben. The largest impact crater, Odysseus, is about 400 km in diameter, whereas the largest graben, Ithaca Chasma, is about 100 km wide and more than 2,000 km long; the two surface features may be related. A small part of the surface is covered by smooth plains that may be cryovolcanic in origin. Like the other regular moons of Saturn, Tethys formed from the Saturnian sub-nebula—a disk of gas and dust that surrounded Saturn soon after its formation.

Tethys has been approached and observed by several space probes, including &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; (1979), &quot;Voyager 1&quot; (1980) and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; (1981), with &quot;Cassini-Huygens&quot; observing the moon the most, and in greatest detail, during its extensive mission to the Saturnian system (2004-2017).

== Discovery and naming ==

Tethys was discovered by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1684 together with Dione, another moon of Saturn. He had also discovered two moons, Rhea and Iapetus earlier, in 1671–72. Cassini observed all of these moons using a large aerial telescope he set up on the grounds of the Paris Observatory.

Cassini named the four new moons as &quot;Sidera Lodoicea&quot; (&quot;the stars of Louis&quot;) to honour king Louis XIV of France. By the end of the seventeenth century, astronomers fell into the habit of referring to them and Titan as &quot;Saturn I&quot; through &quot;Saturn V&quot; (Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Iapetus). Once Mimas and Enceladus were discovered in 1789 by William Herschel, the numbering scheme was extended to &quot;Saturn VII&quot; by bumping the older five moons up two slots. The discovery of Hyperion in 1848 changed the numbers one last time, bumping Iapetus up to &quot;Saturn VIII&quot;. Henceforth, the numbering scheme would remain fixed.
The modern names of all seven satellites of Saturn come from John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of Mimas and Enceladus). In his 1847 publication &quot;Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope&quot;, he suggested the names of the Titans, sisters and brothers of Kronos (the Greek analogue of Saturn), be used. Tethys is named after the titaness Tethys. It is also designated Saturn III or S III Tethys.

The name &quot;Tethys&quot; has two customary pronunciations, with either a &#x27;long&#x27; or a &#x27;short&#x27; &quot;e&quot;: or . The conventional adjectival form of the name is &quot;Tethyan&quot;, again with either a long or a short &quot;e&quot;.

== Orbit ==
Tethys orbits Saturn at a distance of about 295,000 km (about 4.4 Saturn&#x27;s radii) from the center of the planet. Its orbital eccentricity is negligible, and its orbital inclination is about 1°. Tethys is locked in an inclination resonance with Mimas; however, due to the low gravity of the respective bodies, this interaction does not cause any noticeable orbital eccentricity or tidal heating.

The Tethyan orbit lies deep inside the magnetosphere of Saturn, so the plasma co-rotating with the planet strikes the trailing hemisphere of the moon. Tethys is also subject to constant bombardment by the energetic particles (electrons and ions) present in the magnetosphere.
=== Trojans ===
Tethys has two co-orbital moons, Telesto and Calypso, orbiting near Tethys&#x27;s Lagrange points (60° ahead) and (60° behind) respectively.

== Physical characteristics ==
Tethys is the 16th-largest moon in the Solar System, with a radius of 531 km. Its mass is about (0.000103 Earth mass), which is less than 1% of the Moon. Despite its relatively small mass, it is more massive than all known moons smaller than itself combined.

The density of Tethys is 0.98 g/cm3, indicating that it is composed almost entirely of water-ice.
It is also the fifth-largest of Saturn&#x27;s moons.
It is not known whether Tethys is differentiated into a rocky core and ice mantle. However, if it is differentiated, the radius of the core does not exceed 145 km, and its mass is below 6% of the total mass. Due to the action of tidal and rotational forces, Tethys has the shape of triaxial ellipsoid. The dimensions of this ellipsoid are consistent with it having a homogeneous interior. The existence of a subsurface ocean—a layer of liquid salt water in the interior of Tethys—is considered unlikely.

The surface of Tethys is one of the most reflective (at visual wavelengths) in the Solar System, with a visual albedo of 1.229. This very high albedo is the result of the sandblasting of particles from Saturn&#x27;s E-ring, a faint ring composed of small, water-ice particles generated by Enceladus&#x27;s south polar geysers. The radar albedo of the Tethyan surface is also very high. The leading hemisphere of Tethys is brighter by 10–15% than the trailing one.

The high albedo indicates that the surface of Tethys is composed of almost pure water ice with only a small amount of darker materials. The visible spectrum of Tethys is flat and featureless, whereas in the near-infrared strong water ice absorption bands at 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 μm wavelengths are visible. No compound other than crystalline water ice has been unambiguously identified on Tethys. (Possible constituents include organics, ammonia and carbon dioxide.) The dark material in the ice has the same spectral properties as seen on the surfaces of the dark Saturnian moons—Iapetus and Hyperion. The most probable candidate is nanophase iron or hematite. Measurements of the thermal emission as well as radar observations by the Cassini spacecraft show that the icy regolith on the surface of Tethys is structurally complex and has a large porosity exceeding 95%.


== Surface features ==
=== Color patterns ===

The surface of Tethys has a number of large-scale features distinguished by their color and sometimes brightness. The trailing hemisphere gets increasingly red and dark as the anti-apex of motion is approached. This darkening is responsible for the hemispheric albedo asymmetry mentioned above. The leading hemisphere also reddens slightly as the of the motion is approached, although without any noticeable darkening. Such a bifurcated color pattern results in the existence of a bluish band between hemispheres following a great circle that runs through the poles. This coloration and darkening of the Tethyan surface is typical for Saturnian middle-sized satellites. Its origin may be related to a deposition of bright ice particles from the E-ring onto the leading hemispheres and dark particles coming from outer satellites on the trailing hemispheres. The darkening of the trailing hemispheres can also be caused by the impact of plasma from the magnetosphere of Saturn, which co-rotates with the planet.

On the leading hemisphere of Tethys spacecraft observations have found a dark bluish band spanning 20° to the south and north from the equator. The band has an elliptical shape getting narrower as it approaches the trailing hemisphere. A comparable band exists only on Mimas. The band is almost certainly caused by the influence of energetic electrons from the Saturnian magnetosphere with energies greater than about 1 MeV. These particles drift in the direction opposite to the rotation of the planet and preferentially impact areas on the leading hemisphere close to the equator. Temperature maps of Tethys obtained by &quot;Cassini&quot; have shown this bluish region is cooler at midday than surrounding areas, giving the satellite a &quot;Pac-man&quot;-like appearance at mid-infrared wavelengths.

=== Geology ===
The surface of Tethys mostly consists of hilly cratered terrain dominated by craters more than 40 km in diameter. A smaller portion of the surface is represented by the smooth plains on the trailing hemisphere. There are also a number of tectonic features such as chasmata and troughs.

The western part of the leading hemisphere of Tethys is dominated by Odysseus, a large impact basin whose 450 km diameter is nearly 2/5 of that of Tethys itself. The crater is now quite flat – more precisely, its floor conforms to Tethys&#x27;s spherical shape. This is most likely due to the viscous relaxation of the Tethyan icy crust over geologic time. Nevertheless, the rim crest of Odysseus is elevated by approximately 5 km above the mean satellite radius. The central complex of Odysseus features a central pit 2–4 km deep surrounded by massifs elevated by 6–9 km above the crater floor, which itself is about 3 km below the average radius.

The second major feature seen on Tethys is a huge valley called Ithaca Chasma, about 100 km wide and 3 km deep. It is more than 2,000 km in length, approximately 3/4 of the way around Tethys&#x27;s circumference. Ithaca Chasma occupies about 10% of the surface of Tethys. It is approximately concentric with Odysseus—a pole of Ithaca Chasma lies only approximately 20° from the crater.

It is thought that Ithaca Chasma formed as Tethys&#x27;s internal liquid water solidified, causing the moon to expand and cracking the surface to accommodate the extra volume within. The subsurface ocean may have resulted from a 2:3 orbital resonance between Dione and Tethys early in the Solar System&#x27;s history that led to orbital eccentricity and tidal heating of Tethys&#x27;s interior. The ocean would have frozen after the moons escaped from the resonance. There is another theory about the formation of Ithaca Chasma: when the impact that caused the great crater Odysseus occurred, the shock wave traveled through Tethys and fractured the icy, brittle surface. In this case Ithaca Chasma would be the outermost ring graben of Odysseus. However, age determination based on crater counts in high-resolution Cassini images showed that Ithaca Chasma is older than Odysseus making the impact hypothesis unlikely.

The smooth plains on the trailing hemisphere are approximately antipodal to Odysseus, although they extend about 60° to the northeast from the exact antipode. The plains have a relatively sharp boundary with the surrounding cratered terrain. The location of this unit near Odysseus&#x27; antipode argues for a connection between the crater and plains. The latter can be a result of focusing the seismic waves produced by the impact in the center of the opposite hemisphere. However the smooth appearance of the plains together with their sharp boundaries (impact shaking would have produced a wide transitional zone) indicates that they formed by endogenic intrusion, possibly along the lines of weakness in the Tethyan lithosphere created by Odysseus impact.

=== Impact craters and chronology ===

The majority of Tethyan impact craters are of a simple central peak type. Those more than 150 km in diameter show more complex peak ring morphology. Only Odysseus crater has a central depression resembling a central pit. Older impact craters are somewhat shallower than young ones implying a degree of relaxation.

The density of impact craters varies across the surface of Tethys. The higher the crater density, the older the surface. This allows scientists to establish a relative chronology for Tethys. The cratered terrain is the oldest unit likely dating back to the Solar System formation 4.56 billion years ago. The youngest unit lies within Odysseus crater with an estimated age from 3.76 to 1.06 billion years, depending on the absolute chronology used. Ithaca Chasma is older than Odysseus.

== Origin and evolution ==
Tethys is thought to have formed from an accretion disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that existed around Saturn for some time after its formation. The low temperature at the position of Saturn in the Solar nebular means that water ice was the primary solid from which all moons formed. Other more volatile compounds like ammonia and carbon dioxide were likely present as well, though their abundances are not well constrained.

The extremely water-ice-rich composition of Tethys remains unexplained. The conditions in the Saturnian sub-nebula likely favored conversion of the molecular nitrogen and carbon monoxide into ammonia and methane, respectively. This can partially explain why Saturnian moons including Tethys contain more water ice than outer Solar System bodies like Pluto or Triton as the oxygen freed from carbon monoxide would react with the hydrogen forming water. One of the most interesting explanations proposed is that the rings and inner moons accreted from the tidally stripped ice-rich crust of a Titan-like moon before it was swallowed by Saturn.

The accretion process probably lasted for several thousand years before the moon was fully formed. Models suggest that impacts accompanying accretion caused heating of Tethys&#x27;s outer layer, reaching a maximum temperature of around 155 K at a depth of about 29 km. After the end of formation due to thermal conduction, the subsurface layer cooled and the interior heated up. The cooling near-surface layer contracted and the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in Tethys&#x27;s crust reaching estimates of 5.7 MPa, which likely led to cracking.

Because Tethys lacks substantial rock content, the heating by decay of radioactive elements is unlikely to have played a significant role in its further evolution. This also means that Tethys may have never experienced any significant melting unless its interior was heated by tides. They may have occurred, for instance, during the passage of Tethys through an orbital resonance with Dione or some other moon. Still, present knowledge of the evolution of Tethys is very limited.

== Exploration ==
&quot;Pioneer 11&quot; flew by Saturn in 1979, and its closest approach to Tethys was 329,197 km on 1 September 1979.

One year later, on 12 November 1980, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; flew 415,670 km from Tethys. Its twin spacecraft, &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, passed as close as 93,010 km from the moon on 26 August 1981. Although both spacecraft took images of Tethys, the resolution of &quot;Voyager 1&quot;&#x27;s images did not exceed 15 km, and only those obtained by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; had a resolution as high as 2 km. The first geological feature discovered in 1980 by &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was Ithaca Chasma. Later in 1981 &quot;Voyager 2&quot; revealed that it almost circled the moon running for 270°. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; also discovered the Odysseus crater. Tethys was the Saturnian satellite most fully imaged by the &quot;Voyagers&quot;.

The &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft entered orbit around Saturn in 2004. During its primary mission from June 2004 through June 2008 it performed one very close targeted flyby of Tethys on 24 September 2005 at the distance of 1,503 km. In addition to this flyby the spacecraft performed many non-targeted flybys during its primary and equinox missions since 2004, at distances of tens of thousands of kilometers.

Another flyby of Tethys took place on 14 August 2010 (during the solstice mission) at a distance of 38,300 km, when the fourth-largest crater on Tethys, Penelope, which is 207 km wide, was imaged. More non-targeted flybys were planned for the solstice mission in 2011–2017.

&quot;Cassini&quot;″s observations allowed high-resolution maps of Tethys to be produced with the resolution of 0.29 km. The spacecraft obtained spatially resolved near-infrared spectra of Tethys showing that its surface is made of water ice mixed with a dark material, whereas the far-infrared observations constrained the bolometric bond albedo. The radar observations at the wavelength of 2.2 cm showed that the ice regolith has a complex structure and is very porous. The observations of plasma in the vicinity of Tethys demonstrated that it is a geologically dead body producing no new plasma in the Saturnian magnetosphere.

Future missions to Tethys and the Saturn system are uncertain, but one possibility is the Titan Saturn System Mission.

== Quadrangles ==

Tethys is divided into 15 quadrangles:

# North Polar Area
# Anticleia
# Odysseus
# Alcinous
# Telemachus
# Circe
# Polycaste
# Theoclymenus
# Penelope
# Salmoneus
# Ithaca Chasma
# Hermione
# Melanthius
# Antinous
# South Polar Area

<text>The Mares of Diomedes (), also called the Mares of Thrace, were a herd of man-eating horses in Greek mythology. Magnificent, wild, and uncontrollable, they belonged to Diomedes of Thrace (not to be confused with Diomedes, son of Tydeus), king of Thrace, son of Ares and Cyrene who lived on the shores of the Black Sea. Bucephalus, Alexander the Great&#x27;s horse, was said to be descended from these mares.

== Mythology ==
As the eighth of his Twelve Labours, also categorised as the second of the Non-Peloponnesian labours, Heracles was sent by King Eurystheus to steal the Mares from Diomedes. The mares’ madness was attributed to their unnatural diet which consisted of the flesh of unsuspecting guests or strangers to the island. Some versions of the myth say that the mares also expelled fire when they breathed. The Mares, which were the terror of Thrace, were kept tethered by iron chains to a bronze manger in the now vanished city of Tirida and were named Podargos (the swift), Lampon (the shining), Xanthos (the yellow) and Deinos (or Deinus, the terrible). Although very similar, there are slight variances in the exact details regarding the mares’ capture.

In one version, Heracles brought a number of volunteers to help him capture the giant horses. After overpowering Diomedes’ men, Heracles broke the chains that tethered the horses and drove the mares down to sea. Unaware that the mares were man-eating and uncontrollable, Heracles left them in the charge of his favored companion, Abderus, while he left to fight Diomedes. Upon his return, Heracles found that the boy was eaten. As revenge, Heracles fed Diomedes to his own horses and then founded Abdera next to the boy&#x27;s tomb.

In another version, Heracles, who was visiting the island, stayed awake so that he didn&#x27;t have his throat cut by Diomedes in the night, and cut the chains binding the horses once everyone was asleep. Having scared the horses onto the high ground of a knoll, Heracles quickly dug a trench through the peninsula, filling it with water and thus flooding the low-lying plain. When Diomedes and his men turned to flee, Heracles killed them with an axe (or a club), and fed Diomedes’ body to the horses to calm them.

In yet another version, Heracles first captured Diomedes and fed him to the mares &quot;before&quot; releasing them. Only after realizing that their King was dead did his men, the Bistonians, attack Heracles. Upon seeing the mares charging at them, led in a chariot by Abderus, the Bistonians turned and fled.

All versions have eating human flesh make the horses calmer, giving Heracles the opportunity to bind their mouths shut, and easily take them back to King Eurystheus, who dedicated the horses to Hera. In some versions, they were allowed to roam freely around Argos, having become permanently calm, but in others, Eurystheus ordered the horses taken to Olympus to be sacrificed to Zeus, but Zeus refused them, and sent wolves, lions, and bears to kill them. Roger Lancelyn Green states in his &quot;Tales of the Greek Heroes&quot; that the mares’ descendants were used in the Trojan War, and survived even to the time of Alexander the Great. After the incident, Eurystheus sent Heracles to bring back Hippolyta&#x27;s Girdle.

<text>In Greek mythology, Mégês Phyleïdês (Ancient Greek: Μέγης Φυλεΐδης) was the commander of Epeans and/or Dulichians during the Trojan War.

== Family ==
Meges was the son of King Phyleus of Dulichium and his mother&#x27;s name is variously given as either Eustyoche, Ctimene, Ctesimache, Hagnete or Timandra.

Meges’ (half-)sister was Eurydameia, mother of Cleitus and Euchenor by the seer Polyidus of Corinth.

== Mythology ==
Meges was one of the suitors of Helen, and commanded the armies of the Echinadians and the Dulichians during the Trojan War, having summoned forty or sixty ships; he also led a contingent of Epeans who had once migrated to Dulichium together with his father.

Meges was credited with killing a number of opponents, including Pedaeus (a son of Antenor), Croesmus, Amphiclus, Itymoneus, Agelaus, Eurymenes, and Deiopites. Dolops attempted to strike him with a spear but the corselet Meges was wearing, a gift for his father from Euphetes of Ephyra, saved his life. Meges helped Odysseus to collect gifts for Achilles. He was one of the men to enter the Trojan Horse.

According to Dictys Cretensis, Meges fell at Troy. Pausanias mentions a painting of him wounded in the arm by a Trojan, Admetes the son of Augeas. Tzetzes relates that Meges, along with Prothous and a number of others, perished at Euboea.

<text>:&quot;The name Melanippe is the feminine counterpart of Melanippus.&quot;
In Greek mythology, the name Melanippe () referred to several different people:
* Melanippe, daughter of the Centaur Chiron. Also known as Hippe or Euippe. She bore a daughter to Aeolus, Melanippe or Arne (see below). She escaped to Mount Pelion so that her father would not find out that she was pregnant, but, being searched for, she prayed to Artemis asking for assistance, and the goddess transformed her into a mare. Other accounts state that the transformation was a punishment for her having scorned Artemis, or for having divulged the secrets of gods. She was later placed among the stars.
*Melanippe, daughter of Aeolus and the precedent Melanippe (or else daughter of Hippotes or of Desmontes).
* Melanippe, a Aetolian princess as the daughter of King Oeneus of Calydon and Althaea, daughter of King Thestius of Pleuron. As one of the Meleagrids, she was turned into a guinea fowl by Artemis after the death of her brother, Meleager.
* Melanippe, an Amazon, sister of Hippolyta, Penthesilea and Antiope, daughter of Ares. Heracles captured her and demanded Hippolyte&#x27;s girdle in exchange for her freedom. Hippolyte complied and Heracles let her go. Some say that it was Melanippe whom Theseus abducted and married. Yet others relate that she was killed by Telamon.
* Melanippe, wife of Hippotes, son of Mimas, himself son of Aeolus, and the mother of another Aeolus.
* Melanippe, a nymph who married Itonus, son of Amphictyon.
*Melanippe, possible wife of King Chalcodon of Euboea and mother of Elephenor.
*&quot;Melanippe&quot;, an emendation for &quot;Medippe&quot; (name of one of the sacrificial victims of Minotaur) in Servius&#x27; commentaries on &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

<text>:&quot;The name Melanippus is the masculine counterpart of Melanippe.&quot;

In Greek mythology, there were several people named Melanippus ():
*Melanippus, one of the sons of Agrius and possibly Dia, daughter of King Porthaon of Calydon. Along with his brothers, except Thersites, he was killed by Diomedes.
*Melanippus or Menalippus, brother of Tydeus and thus possible son of Oeneus, king of Calydon and Periboea. He was accidentally slain by Tydeus during a hunt. In some accounts, the murdered brother of Tydeus was called Olenias.
*Melanippus, son of Perigune and Theseus, the father of Ioxus who, together with Ornytus, led a colony to Caria and became the ancestor of the family Ioxides.
*Melanippus, sometimes misspelled &quot;Menalippus&quot;, son of Astacus (hence referred to by the patronymic &quot;Astacides&quot; in Ovid), defender of Thebes in Aeschylus&#x27; play &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;. In the play, he defended the Proitid gate against Tydeus. He killed two of the seven attacking champions, Mecisteus and Tydeus, but was killed by either Amphiaraus, or by Tydeus himself as he died. (In versions where Melanippus is killed by someone other than Tydeus, the slayer decapitates him and delivers his head to Tydeus). Tydeus broke Melanippus&#x27; skull open and consumed his brain, which disgusted Athena so that she gave up her intent of making Tydeus immortal. Herodotus relates how in historical times, Cleisthenes abolished the hero cult of Adrastus in Sicyon in favour of that of Melanippus.
*Melanippus, son of Hicetaon and a native of Percote. He was the brother of Thymoetes, Critolaus and possibly Antenor. Melanippus fought under Hector, wishing to avenge the death of his cousin Dolops, and was killed by Antilochus during the Trojan War.
*Melanippus, one of the 50 sons of Priam. His mother was a woman other than Hecuba. He fought in the Trojan War and was shot dead by Teucer. In some accounts, Melanippus was described to have a plume of horsehair like his brother Idaeus.
*Melanippus, yet another Trojan, who was killed by Patroclus.
*Melanippus, one of the Achaeans who fought at Troy. He was one of those who helped Odysseus carry the gifts at the point of reconciliation between Achilles and Agamemnon.
*Melanippus, son of Ares and Triteia, daughter of the sea-god Triton, founder of the city of Tritaia, which he named after his own mother.
*Melanippus, a young man of Patrae who was in love with Comaetho, but the parents on both sides were against their marriage. Melanippus and Comaetho met secretly in the temple of Artemis, where the girl served as priestess, and had sex there. The outraged goddess cursed the country with plague and famine; in order to put an end to the calamity, the inhabitants of Patrae were instructed by the oracle of Delphi to sacrifice both lovers to the goddess and, from then on, to sacrifice the handsomest young man and the most beautiful girl of the city each year, until a new strange deity is introduced in Patrae. The practice lasted until Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, on his way back from Troy, brought an image of Dionysus to Patrae.
*Melanippus, son of Helorus, leader of the Mysian contingent in the Trojan War, killed by Neoptolemus.
*Menalippus (misspelling of &quot;Melanippus&quot;? cf. #3 above), a son of Acastus. He, alongside his brother Pleisthenes and their servant Cinyras, was killed by Neoptolemus as they were hunting near the latter&#x27;s grandfather Peleus&#x27; hideout, since Acastus and his family had been hostile towards Peleus.

In ancient Sicily, Melanippus was a hero of Agrigento alongside his lover Chariton. They plotted against the cruel tyrant Phalaris, but were denounced and tortured. However, their mutual love and their refusal to betray their friends as accomplices moved the tyrant, who dismissed them with great praise.

<doc id="84531" wikidata="Q2307508" url="?curid=84531" title="Cayey, Puerto Rico">
<text>Cayey (), officially Cayey de Muesas, is a mountain town and municipality in central Puerto Rico located on the Sierra de Cayey within the Central Mountain range, north of Salinas and Guayama; south of Cidra and Caguas; east of Aibonito and Salinas; and west of San Lorenzo. Cayey is spread over 21 barrios plus Cayey Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Cayey is notable for its surrounding mountains. The city has been actively growing since the 1990s, evidenced by its designation as a Metropolitan Area by the U.S. Census Bureau. It has experienced significant growth in commerce, and many major retailers, such as Wal-Mart have opened stores in the city. Industries in Cayey include sugar, tobacco and poultry. For tobacco there is a well-known company called Consolidated Cigar Corp. A new coliseum and hospital facilities have also been built. Coca-Cola is a major corporation that has a manufacturing facility in the town. Cayey is also host to one of the campuses of the University of Puerto Rico, the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey.

==History==

Cayey was founded on August 17, 1773, by Juan Mata Vázquez, who became its first mayor. It is popularly said that Cayey derives its name from the Taíno word for &quot;a place of waters&quot;. It was named in honor of Miguel de Muesas, the then governor of Puerto Rico. The town is located in a valley nestled between Puerto Rico&#x27;s Cordillera Central mountain range and the Sierra de Cayey at roughly the midpoint of routes PR-1 and PR-52. The routes lead to a popular drive that provides panoramic views of the island from its highest points.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Cayey was 14,442.

An education base began in the early to mid-1950s when the Interamerican University opened a branch in Cayey providing teacher training through a night class scheme. In 1967 the University of Puerto Rico opened a campus in the former Henry Barracks Military Reservation, and in the early 1980s El Turabo University, subsidiary of the Ana G. Mendez conglomerate opened a campus in the old tobacco factory at the entrance of town. The Interamerican University will be opening a Graduate campus in front of the main town square (downtown), and there are conversations with a foreign educational concern to open a technology campus using the buildings left over by the Gordonshire Knitting Mills. There are three major private schools: Radians School, the long established Colegio de Nuestra Senora de la Merced and La Milagrosa School. Cayey&#x27;s health care base expanded in the mid-1960s with the Mennonite Medical Center and a Municipal
Hospital along with laboratories, and urgent care centers that cater to the poor and the elderly.

With the construction of the Interstate (PR-52), Cayey has evolved into a &quot;bedroom community&quot; with gated housing developments, located just 30 minutes from San Juan and 45 minutes away from Ponce. With pleasant weather and good private schools, Cayey has become a prime location for the affluent.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Cayey with significant amount of rain and wind. The hurricane destroyed 3,000 homes in Cayey.

===Impact of Henry Barracks Military Reservation===
Henry Barracks Military Reservation was a lifeline for the residents of Cayey from 1901 to 1966, when it was declared excess land and passed to the General Services Administration for decommission. The property consisted of (). The property was divided into three prominent encampments: the Spanish Camp or Campamento Español ( ), Camp Henry or Henry Barracks, the Home of the third Battalion of the 65th Inf. Regiment that consisted of , and the Cayey Naval Radio Station ( )). This reservation is situated in the east of the town of Cayey. The Spanish Reservation containing an area of approximately , known as Hospital Hill was set apart by Executive Order of June 30, 1903, under an Act of Congress approved on July 7, 1902. The main army post was located in the northern part of the reservation, initially housing the Puerto Rico Volunteer Infantry Regiment.

The combined posts had approximately 1,200 men who used the resources provided by the town people. Families moved into Punta Brava and Vieques neighborhoods. A laundry, show shop, and other smaller stores were located right outside the gate. By 1906 about 350 civilians had jobs in the two posts (Camp Henry and The Cayey Navy Radio Station).

The U.S. Department of the Navy submitted a proposal to raise three tall masts as part of a global radio communication linkage. In 1916 the Department of the Navy approved a budget of $40,000. At the time 300 men were hired to build the facility for a period of two-year, the project was completed in 1918

On September 11, 1928, a category five hurricane called San Felipe destroyed the temporary buildings at Henry Barracks, and the Navy Radio Station. A radio message was sent from the Cayey Navy Radio Station on September 18, 1928, to follow “All buildings Henry Barracks destroyed by hurricane September 13th”.
The Navy left Cayey and moved its station to Isla Grande and Stop 7 in Puerto de Tierra. All the land held by the Navy included Magazine Hill (known in the community as &quot;El Polvorin&quot;), which was taken over by the U. S. Army. The 65th Infantry Regiment remained in the north side of the post. The south side was converted into two shooting ranges 
The decision was made to reconstruct all building for the regiment in the north side in concrete One hundred and ninety buildings were completed, to include the north side of Henry Barracks. Over 600 men were hired for a period of three years to work in these projects. During this period three large barrack buildings were constructed. The two one company barracks each had its own mess hall and kitchen and was occupied by an infantry company each. The two companies barrack located in the center of the quad occupied the Battalion Headquarters Co. and the Machine Gun Co.

By 1953, the U.S. Department of the Army had reached the conclusion that Henry Barracks would be closed in the near future. A full complement of maintenance personnel composed of professional, technical, and daily laborers were maintained in the Reservation. The growth of three major housing developments is evidence of the economic impact of the Reservation (Reparto Montellano, El Polvorin, Urbanización Aponte)
While the all-Puerto Rican 65th Infantry regiment would never return to its home base, several other initiatives were undertaken, which had a direct impact on the economic development of the town and the region, one such initiatives was the commissioning of the Caribbean Signal Agency in 1959. Over the coming years several tenants occupied the lands comprised by the Henry Barracks Military Reservation, among them:
* In the company size building to the west of the quad, the National Guard had its Officer Training School in 1965 and 1966. It was later moved to Camp Santiago in Salinas. The golf course was used as a helicopter landing strip.
* YMCA Cuerpos de Paz, and VESPRA (1965–68) had an Administration Building, a swimming pool, a golf course and three houses, which housed the majors and their families.
* The Encampment for Citizenship held its 1966 six-week encampment in the two-company building in the middle of the quad. One hundred fifty-one young leaders from 56 countries from all over the world meet in Cayey to learn to develop self-government and to perform community development projects.
* The Foundation for Community Development moved to the housing is located in the southeastern part of the Post until 1972. Thousands of people received training in community development, and leadership during those years.

==Geography==
Cayey is located in a valley surrounded by the Sierra de Cayey, a branching mountain range of the Cordillera Central where the Carite Forest Reserve is located, and the main ranges of the Cordillera Central to the west. Because of its location, Cayey is known for its mountains, its cool weather and its misty mornings, especially in winter. During Spanish colonial rule, Spanish soldiers assigned to Puerto Rico were sent to Cayey. Its cool weather resembled the weather of Spain and soldiers could become acclimated to the tropical weather. In winter, it is not unusual for the temperature to drop into the .

The Carite Forest Reserve
*Rivers are: Río Grande de Loíza, Río Guavate, Río Jájome, Río de la Plata and Río Maton.

===Climate===
Cayey&#x27;s climate is humid, rainy and mild compared to lower-elevation areas of the island, the area of the town is nearly high, so the climate is subtropical high. In summer average high Temperatures are around to and to in winter, and low around to in summer and to in winter. The record maximum temperature is and minimum . The average annual rainfall is 100 inches (2,540 mm) and maximum rainfall record in 24 hours is 20.87 inches (530 mm) of rain.

===Flora and fauna===

The golden coquí (&quot;Eleutherodactylus jasperi&quot;; Spanish: &quot;coquí dorado&quot;) is a rare and possibly extinct leptodactylid frog species endemic to Puerto Rico. Native to the municipality of Cayey, golden coquís have only been found in areas of dense bromeliad growth in the Sierra de Cayey between 2,123 and 2,575 feet (647 and 785 meters) above sea level. They get their name from the song the male coquis sing at night. The golden coqui is the smallest of the coqui frogs in Puerto Rico. Mature adult coquis are roughly the size of a dime. Male coquis are bright yellow where females tend to be more light yellow and brown. The golden coqui is the only frog species in the New World known to give birth to live young. These frogs are known around the whole island and are considered a symbol of Puerto Rico.

===Barrios===

Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Cayey is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as , near the center of the municipality.

===Sectors===
Barrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, are further subdivided into smaller areas called (&quot;sectors&quot; in English). The types of &quot;sectores&quot; may vary, from normally &quot;sector&quot; to &quot;urbanización&quot; to &quot;reparto&quot; to &quot;barriada&quot; to &quot;residencial&quot;, among others.

===Special Communities===

 (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion. A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Cayey: Parcelas Nuevas in Beatriz, Cantera, Sector Jalda Abajo, Cedro, El Coquí, Jájome Bajo, La Placita, Saint Thomas, San Cristóbal, and La Vega.

==Economy==
Cayey&#x27;s economy was based on growing tobacco, sugarcane and general fruits. Its agricultural economy that evolved starting in the 1950s has diminished considerably. Most of its agricultural products are imported from other islands in the Caribbean or mainland United States.

During the first half of the 20th century, Cayey was basically an agricultural area of small farmers and local haciendas dedicated to the farming of crops for the local market. During the 1920s and 1930s farmers increasingly lost their land to absentee landowners, mostly American companies, that turned to the cultivation of sugarcane and, to a lesser extent, tobacco for export. In the 1950s and 1960s some manufacturing concerns established plants in Cayey taking advantage of tax incentives offered by Operation Bootstrap, Puerto Rico&#x27;s industrialization program.

An industrial base, in 1947 Cayey saw the beginning of industrial entrepreneurship. There were three factories in town, the Caribe Flower Co. in the Palo Seco neighborhood, a Baseball Factory in the Toita neighborhood, and a Uniform Factory in the back of the High School. These factories employed mostly females. By 1950 the men that worked agriculture became excess population and began migrating to the United States or join the military. In 1950 with the approval of Fomento Industrial and Operation Bootstrap there was a boom of light factories in Cayey. The Gordonshire Knitting Mill in the Guayama road had twelve large buildings and ran two shifts with more than 1,000 employees, and the Consolidated Cigar Corporation across from the road from the Reparto Montellano neighborhood operated three shifts employing over 2,500 from Cayey and surrounding towns.

There is a Coca-Cola bottling location in Cayey.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Meleagrids (Ancient Greek: ) are the sisters of the hero Meleager, and daughters of Althaea and Oeneus.

== Mythology ==
When their brother died, the Meleagrides cried incessantly until Artemis changed them into guineafowl and transferred them to the island of Leros. According to an alternate version cited in the dictionary of Suda, the Meleagrids were companions of Iocallis, a maiden of Leros who was honored as a deity. Guinea fowl were kept in the shrine of The Maiden (likely Artemis) on Leros, and the inhabitants of the island, as well as other worshippers of Artemis, abstained from eating the bird.

The Meleagrids included Melanippe and Eurymede, possibly also Mothone, Perimede and Polyxo. Two other daughters of Oeneus, Gorge and Deianeira, were not transformed, since the former was married off to Andraemon, and the latter to Heracles.

<text>Antiochus I Soter (, &quot;Antíochos Sōtér&quot;; &quot;Antiochus the Savior&quot;; 2 June 261 BC) was a Macedonian king of the Seleucid Empire. Antiochus succeeded his father Seleucus I Nicator in 281 BC and reigned during a period of instability which he mostly overcame until his death on 2 June 261 BC. He is the last known ruler to be attributed the ancient Mesopotamian title King of the Universe.

==Biography==
Antiochus&#x27;s father was Seleucus I Nicator and his mother was Apama, daughter of Spitamenes, being one of the princesses whom Alexander the Great had given as wives to his generals in 324 BC. The Seleucids fictitiously claimed that Apama was the daughter of Darius III, in order to legitimise themselves as the inheritors of both the Achaemenids and Alexander, and therefore the rightful lords of western and central Asia.

In 294 BC, prior to the death of his father Seleucus I, Antiochus married his stepmother, Stratonice, daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes. The ancient sources report that his elderly father reportedly instigated the marriage after discovering that his son was in danger of dying of lovesickness. Stratonice bore five children to Antiochus: Seleucus (later executed for rebellion), Laodice, Apama II, Stratonice II and Antiochus II Theos, who succeeded his father as king.

The &quot;Ruin of Esagila Chronicle&quot;, dated between 302 and 281 BC, mentions that a crown prince, most likely Antiochus, decided to rebuild the ruined Babylonian temple Esagila, and made a sacrifice in preparation. However, while there, he stumbled on the rubble and fell. He then ordered his troops to destroy the last of the remains.

On the assassination of his father in 281 BC, the task of holding together the empire was a formidable one. A revolt in Syria broke out almost immediately. Antiochus was soon compelled to make peace with his father&#x27;s murderer, Ptolemy Keraunos, apparently abandoning Macedonia and Thrace. In Anatolia he was unable to reduce Bithynia or the Persian dynasties that ruled in Cappadocia.

In 278 BC the Gauls broke into Anatolia, and a victory that Antiochus won over these Gauls by using Indian war elephants (275 BC) is said to have been the origin of his title of &quot;Soter&quot; (Greek for &quot;saviour&quot;).

At the end of 275 BC the question of Coele-Syria, which had been open between the houses of Seleucus and Ptolemy since the partition of 301 BC, led to hostilities (the First Syrian War). It had been continuously in Ptolemaic occupation, but the house of Seleucus maintained its claim. War did not materially change the outlines of the two kingdoms, though frontier cities like Damascus and the coast districts of Asia Minor might change hands.

In 268 BC Antiochus I laid the foundation for the Ezida Temple in Borsippa. His eldest son Seleucus had ruled in the east as viceroy from c. 275 BC until 268/267 BC; Antiochus put his son to death in the latter year on the charge of rebellion. Around 262 BC Antiochus tried to break the growing power of Pergamum by force of arms, but suffered defeat near Sardis and died soon afterwards. He was succeeded in 261 BC by his second son Antiochus II Theos.

===City of Ai-Khanoum===

Recent analysis strongly suggests that the Greek city of Ai-Khanoum, located in Takhar Province, northern Afghanistan, at the confluence of the Panj River and the Kokcha River and at the doorstep of the Indian subcontinent, was founded c. 280 BC by Antiochus I.

===Relations with India===
Antiochus I maintained friendly diplomatic relations with Bindusara, ruler of the Maurya Empire of India. Deimachos of Plateia was the ambassador of Antiochus at the court of Bindusara. The 3rd century Greek writer Athenaeus, in his &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot;, mentions an incident that he learned from Hegesander&#x27;s writings: Bindusara requested Antiochus to send him sweet wine, dried figs and a sophist. Antiochus replied that he would send the wine and the figs, but the Greek laws forbade him to sell a sophist.

Antiochus is likely the Greek king mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka, as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor Ashoka&#x27;s Buddhist proselytism:


Ashoka also claims that he encouraged the development of herbal medicine, for men and animals, in the territories of the Hellenic kings:
Alternatively, the Greek king mentioned in the Edict of Ashoka could also be Antiochus&#x27;s son and successor, Antiochus II Theos, although the proximity of Antiochus I with the East may makes him a better candidate.

==Neoclassical art==

The love between Antiochus and his stepmother Stratonice was often depicted in Neoclassical art, as in a painting by Jacques-Louis David.
