<text>Killer of Sheep is a 1978 American drama film edited, filmed, written, produced, and directed by Charles Burnett. Shot primarily in 1972 and 1973, it was originally submitted by Burnett to the UCLA School of Film in 1977 as his Master of Fine Arts thesis. It features Henry G. Sanders, Kaycee Moore, and Charles Bracy, among others, in acting roles.

The film depicts the culture of urban African-Americans in Los Angeles&#x27; Watts district in a style often likened to Italian neorealism. Critic Dana Stevens described its plot as &quot;a collection of brief vignettes which are so loosely connected that it feels at times like you&#x27;re watching a non-narrative film.&quot; There are no acts, plot arcs or character development, as conventionally defined.

&quot;Killer of Sheep&quot; premiered at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York on November 14, 1978. It did not receive a general release because Burnett had not secured rights to the music used in its production. The music rights were licensed in 2007 (and again in 2024) by Milestone Film &amp; Video for US $150,000 after the film was restored by UCLA and transferred from a 16 mm to a 35 mm print. &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot; received a 200+ city release 30 years after it was first premiered, with a DVD release in late 2007. The film was restored by the UCLA preservationist Ross Lipman, presented on DVD by Steven Soderbergh and distributed by Milestone Films. In 1990, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Stan works long hours at a slaughterhouse in Watts, Los Angeles. The monotonous nature of his work begins to affect his home life with his unnamed wife and their two children, Stan Jr. and Angela. Through a series of episodic events—such as acquaintances attempting to involve Stan in a criminal scheme, a white woman propositioning him to work at her store, and Stan and his friend Bracy trying to purchase a car engine—a mosaic of a harsh working-class life emerges. Within this life, Stan feels powerless to change the course of his circumstances.

==Cast==
*Henry G. Sanders as Stan
*Kaycee Moore as Stan&#x27;s wife
*Charles Bracy as Bracy
*Angela Burnett as Stan&#x27;s daughter
*Eugene Cherry as Eugene
*Jack Drummond as Stan&#x27;s son

==Production==
Burnett used grant money from the UCLA School of Film to help finance the film, but delayed production because his first choice of actor was in prison and he wanted to wait until he was paroled. Meanwhile, he made the short film &quot;The Horse&quot;. When the university insisted he make his thesis film with or without his first-choice actor, Burnett cast Henry Sanders.

&quot;Killer of Sheep&quot; was shot in Watts on a budget of less than US$10,000 ($38,000 in 2016 dollars) over roughly a year&#x27;s worth of weekends in 1972 and 1973, with additional shooting in 1975. In 1977, Burnett submitted the film as his Master of Fine Arts thesis at the School of Film at the University of California, Los Angeles. Burnett said he also intended to make the film a history of African-American music and filled it with music from a variety of genres and different eras. Burnett also kept a stable job while &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot; was being shot, spending his time working at an agency reading scripts and synopses.

== Roof jumping scene ==
One scene contains a low-angle shot of children leaping from rooftop to rooftop. Juliet Clark, a journalist writing for the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, said the scene shows how children in the film &quot;seem to achieve a mobility that eludes their elders&quot;.

In 2009, a still from the scene, showing one of the boys mid-jump, was reproduced in red tint and used as the cover of rapper Mos Def&#x27;s album &quot;The Ecstatic&quot;. According to &quot;Complex&quot; magazine&#x27;s Dale Eisinger, the &quot;subtle and still-moving&quot; cover has a &quot;hazy, dream-like movement, appearing as a non-narrative, loose collection of vignettes that are tangentially fascinating and incredibly powerful&quot;, while reflecting the ideas of cultural justice and global inequality present throughout Mos Def&#x27;s work.

==Critical reception==
Though the film won the Critics&#x27; Award at the Berlin International Film Festival and was acclaimed at the Toronto International Film Festival, it never saw wide release due to complications in securing the music rights for the 22 songs on the soundtrack, which included such big names as Dinah Washington, Paul Robeson, Louis Armstrong, and Earth, Wind and Fire. It remained in obscurity for nearly 30 years, garnering much critical and academic praise and earning a reputation as a lost classic. The film did not win an award until four years after it came out, after having to wait four years to be released.

&quot;Killer of Sheep&quot; holds a 97% &quot;fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: &quot;By turns funny, sad, and profound, &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot; offers a sympathetic and humane glimpse into inner-city life.&quot; Critics and scholars have likened the film to the work of Italian neorealist directors, particularly Vittorio De Sica and Roberto Rossellini, for its documentary aesthetic and use of mostly non-professional, on-location actors. Burnett has also been compared to Yasujirō Ozu for his strong sense of composition, Stanley Kubrick for his sharp ear for juxtaposing popular music with images, John Cassavetes for his knack for coaxing natural performances from amateur actors, and Robert Altman for his interest in the minutiae of human interaction. Burnett&#x27;s self-professed influences are Jean Renoir, Basil Wright, and Federico Fellini, all of whom exemplify the tender, humane and compassionate qualities for which Burnett has been praised, qualities intensely present in &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot;. Critic Andrew O&#x27;Hehir, noting the strong influences of Jean Renoir, Roberto Rossellini, and Satyajit Ray, said, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to overemphasize how strange and ambitious and completely out of context it was for a black urban filmmaker with no money and no reputation to make that kind of movie in 1977.&quot;

In 1990, the Library of Congress selected it as part of the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked the film No. 398 of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;.

The National Society of Film Critics chose &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot; as one of its 100 Essential Films.

In 2015, the BBC named the film the 26th greatest American movie ever made.

==Distribution==
Having previously only existed on 16mm prints, the film was restored and enlarged to 35mm by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, then digitized by Milestone Films. The soundtrack, which had not been licensed, was also paid for at a cost of over US$150 000, thanks in part to a donation from filmmaker Steven Soderbergh

On March 30, 2007, it opened in select theaters in the United States and Canada and on November 13, 2007, it was released on DVD as part of a deluxe box set with a director&#x27;s cut of Burnett&#x27;s sophomore feature &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Wedding&quot; and three Burnett shorts: &quot;Several Friends&quot; (a 1969 aesthetic precursor to &quot;Killer of Sheep&quot;), &quot;The Horse&quot; (an &quot;allegory of the South&quot;, in Burnett&#x27;s words), and &quot;When It Rains&quot; (praised as one of the greatest short films of all time by critic Jonathan Rosenbaum).

On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, January 21, 2008, Turner Classic Movies presented the world broadcast premiere of the film as part of a night-long marathon of Burnett&#x27;s work. Burnett was interviewed before and after the film by TCM&#x27;s primetime host Robert Osborne.

<doc id="74856" wikidata="Q1777688" url="?curid=74856" title="Knute Rockne, All American">
<text>Knute Rockne, All American is a 1940 American biographical film that tells the story of Knute Rockne, Notre Dame&#x27;s legendary football coach. It stars Pat O&#x27;Brien as Rockne and Ronald Reagan as player George Gipp, as well as Gale Page, Donald Crisp, Albert Bassermann, Owen Davis Jr., Nick Lukats, Kane Richmond, William Marshall and William Byrne. The film also includes cameos by football coaches &quot;Pop&quot; Warner, Amos Alonzo Stagg, William H. Spaulding and Howard Jones, playing themselves.

Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign revived interest in the film, and as a result, some reporters called him the Gipper.

The movie was written by Robert Buckner and directed by Lloyd Bacon, who replaced William K. Howard after filming had begun. In 1997, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==
Lars Knutson Rockne, a carriage builder, moves his family from Norway in 1892, settling in Chicago. His son, Knute, saves up his money and enrolls in college at the Notre Dame campus in South Bend, Indiana, where he plays football.

Rockne and teammate Gus Dorais star in Notre Dame&#x27;s historic 35–13 upset over Army at West Point in 1913. The game is historically significant as Notre Dame employed the seldom-used forward pass to great effect. The publicity from the Fighting Irish&#x27;s surprise win creates Notre Dame football fans around the country.

After graduation, Rockne marries his sweetheart Bonnie Skiles and stays on at Notre Dame to teach chemistry, work on synthetic rubber in the chemistry lab (under Father Julius Nieuwland) and, in his spare time, serve as an assistant coach of the Fighting Irish football team under head coach Jesse Harper.

Outstanding freshman halfback George Gipp leads the Irish to greater gridiron glory. Gipp is stricken with a fatal illness after the final game of the 1920 season, and on his death bed, he encourages Rockne to someday tell the team to &quot;win one for the Gipper.&quot;

Notre Dame continues its football success with a backfield of stars dubbed the Four Horsemen. Rockne is killed in a 1931 plane crash on a trip to California, but his legend makes him a campus immortal.

==Reception==
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;one of the best pictures for boys in years&quot; and wrote that O&#x27;Brien conveyed &quot;a valid impression of an iron-willed, dynamic and cryptic fellow who could very well be &#x27;Rock.&#x27; As a memorial to a fine and inspiring molder of character in young men, this picture ranks high. But, like the Carnegie Foundation has done on previous occasions, we are inclined to question its overemphasis of the pigskin sport.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;one of the best biographical picturizations ever turned out ... Pat O&#x27;Brien delivers a fine characterization of the immortal Rockne, catching the spirit of the role with an understanding of the human qualities of the man.&quot;

&quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote: &quot;Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s life-like Rockne is brilliantly delineated; it&#x27;s as though Rockne himself were striding across the field once more.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote: &quot;Very good! It is the first football picture produced without any &#x27;hokum&#x27;; it shows how teams are developed and what the game means to both players and coach ... The football scenes should prove thrilling to all.&quot;

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the story had been &quot;suitably handled for its public of energetic young people and South Bend alumni.&quot;

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Movie Quotes:
** Knute Rockne: &quot;Tell &#x27;em to go out there with all they got and win just one for the Gipper.&quot; – #89

==&quot;Win just one for the Gipper&quot;==
This quote ranked No. 89 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years...100 Movie Quotes&quot; list. However, for many years during which United Artists held the rights, the Gipper sequence was cut for television showings. For the film&#x27;s initial release to home video, MGM/UA restored the sequence as part of the original uncut version, and this is the version that has been used for all home video, television and theatrical reissues since.

The phrase &quot;win one for the Gipper&quot; was later used as a political slogan by Ronald Reagan, who was often referred to as the Gipper because he had played the role of George Gipp in &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot;. At the 1988 Republican National Convention, Reagan told his vice president George H. W. Bush, &quot;George, go out there and win one for the Gipper.&quot; Bob Dole used the phrase at the 1996 Republican National Convention, as did President George W. Bush at the 2004 Republican National Convention in his acceptance speech when he stated &quot;We can now truly win one for the Gipper&quot; shortly after Reagan&#x27;s death.

The line is spoken by the dying pilot Al Ross in the 1964 film &quot;Flight to Fury&quot;.

The speech is parodied in the film &quot;Airplane!&quot;, which was released when Reagan was running for the presidency in 1980.

==Historical accuracy==
Neither Notre Dame nor the NCAA recognizes Knute Rockne as a (first team) All-American.

Knute Rockne gives the famous &quot;win one for the Gipper,&quot; speech at halftime of the 1930 game during his final championship season, but the speech was actually given at halftime of the 1928 game during a season in which Notre Dame finished with a 5–4 record.

<doc id="74857" wikidata="Q140188" url="?curid=74857" title="Aristarchus of Samos">
<text>Aristarchus of Samos (; , &quot;Aristarkhos ho Samios&quot;; ) was an ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician who presented the first known heliocentric model that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, with the Earth revolving around the Sun once a year and rotating about its axis once a day. He also supported the theory of Anaxagoras according to which the Sun was just another star.

He likely moved to Alexandria, and he was a student of Strato of Lampsacus, who later became the third head of the Peripatetic School in Greece. According to Ptolemy, he observed the summer solstice of 280 BC. Along with his contributions to the heliocentric model, as reported by Vitruvius, he created two separate sundials: one that is a flat disc; and one hemispherical. 

Aristarchus was influenced by the concept presented by Philolaus of Croton (c. 470 – 385 BC) of a fire at the center of the universe, but Aristarchus identified the &quot;central fire&quot; with the Sun and he arranged the other planets in their correct order of distance around the Sun.

Like Anaxagoras before him, Aristarchus suspected that the stars were just other bodies like the Sun, albeit farther away from Earth. His astronomical ideas were often rejected in favor of the geocentric theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy. Nicolaus Copernicus knew that Aristarchus had a &#x27;moving Earth&#x27; theory, although it is unlikely that Copernicus was aware that it was a heliocentric theory.

Aristarchus estimated the sizes of the Sun and Moon as compared to Earth&#x27;s size. He also estimated the distances from the Earth to the Sun and Moon. He is considered one of the greatest astronomers of antiquity along with Hipparchus.

== Heliocentrism ==
The original text has been lost, but a reference in a book by Archimedes, entitled &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot; (&quot;Archimedis Syracusani Arenarius &amp; Dimensio Circuli&quot;), describes a work in which Aristarchus advanced the heliocentric model as an alternative hypothesis to geocentrism:


Aristarchus suspected the stars were other suns that are very far away, and that in consequence there was no observable parallax, that is, a movement of the stars relative to each other as the Earth moves around the Sun. Since stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes, his accurate speculation was unprovable at the time.

It is a common misconception that the heliocentric view was considered sacrilegious by the contemporaries of Aristarchus. Lucio Russo traces this to Gilles Ménage&#x27;s printing of a passage from Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon&quot;, in which Aristarchus jokes with Cleanthes, who is head of the Stoics, a sun worshipper, and opposed to heliocentrism. In the manuscript of Plutarch&#x27;s text, Aristarchus says Cleanthes should be charged with impiety. Ménage&#x27;s version, published shortly after the trials of Galileo and Giordano Bruno, transposes an accusative and nominative so that it is Aristarchus who is purported to be impious. The resulting misconception of an isolated and persecuted Aristarchus is still promulgated.

According to Plutarch, while Aristarchus postulated heliocentrism only as a hypothesis, Seleucus of Seleucia, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived a century after Aristarchus, maintained it as a definite opinion and gave a demonstration of it, but no full record of the demonstration has been found. In his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;, Pliny the Elder later wondered whether errors in the predictions about the heavens could be attributed to a displacement of the Earth from its central position. Pliny and Seneca referred to the retrograde motion of some planets as an apparent (unreal) phenomenon, which is an implication of heliocentrism rather than geocentrism. Still, no stellar parallax was observed, and Plato, Aristotle, and Ptolemy preferred the geocentric model that was believed throughout the Middle Ages.

The heliocentric theory was revived by Copernicus, after which Johannes Kepler described planetary motions with greater accuracy with his three laws. Isaac Newton later gave a theoretical explanation based on laws of gravitational attraction and dynamics.

After realizing that the Sun was much larger than the Earth and the other planets, Aristarchus concluded that planets revolved around the Sun.

== Distance to the Sun ==

The only known work attributed to Aristarchus, &quot;On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon&quot;, is based on a geocentric worldview. Historically, it has been read as stating that the angle subtended by the Sun&#x27;s diameter is two degrees, but Archimedes states in &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot; that Aristarchus had a value of half a degree, which is much closer to the average value of 32&#x27; or 0.53 degrees. The discrepancy may come from a misinterpretation of which unit of measure was meant by a Greek term in the text of Aristarchus.

Aristarchus claimed that at half moon (first or last quarter moon), the angle between the Sun and Moon was 87°. He may have proposed 87° as a lower bound, since gauging the lunar terminator&#x27;s deviation from linearity to one degree of accuracy is beyond the unaided human ocular limit (which is about three arcminutes of accuracy). Aristarchus is known to have studied light and vision as well.

Using correct geometry, but the insufficiently accurate 87° datum, Aristarchus concluded that the Sun was between 18 and 20 times farther away from the Earth than the Moon. (The correct value of this angle is close to 89° 50&#x27;, and the Sun&#x27;s distance is approximately 400 times that of the Moon.) The implicit inaccurate solar parallax of slightly under three degrees was used by astronomers up to and including Tycho Brahe, c. AD 1600. Aristarchus pointed out that the Moon and Sun have nearly equal apparent angular sizes, and therefore their diameters must be in proportion to their distances from Earth.

== Size of the Moon and Sun ==
In &quot;On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon&quot;, Aristarchus discusses the size of the Moon and Sun in relation to the Earth. In order to achieve these measurements and subsequent calculations, he used several key notes made while observing a lunar eclipse. The first of these consisted of the time that it took for the Earth&#x27;s shadow to fully encompass the Moon, along with how long the Moon remained within the shadow. This was used to estimate the angular radius of the shadow. From there, using the width of the cone that was created by the shadow in relation to the Moon, he determined that it was twice the diameter of the Moon at the full, non-central eclipse. In addition to this, Aristarchus estimated that the length of the shadow extended around 2.4 times the distance of the Moon from the Earth.

Using these calculations, along with his estimated distances of the Sun from the Earth and Moon from the Earth, he created a triangle. Employing geometry similar to that he had already used for the distances, he was able to determine that the diameter of the Moon is roughly one-third of the Earth&#x27;s diameter. In order to estimate the size of the Sun, Aristarchus considered the proportion of the Sun&#x27;s distance to Earth in comparison to the Moon&#x27;s distance from Earth, which was found to be roughly 18 to 20 times the length. Therefore, the size of the Sun is around 19 times wider than the Moon, making it approximately six times wider than the Earth&#x27;s diameter.

== Legacy ==
The lunar crater Aristarchus, the minor planet 3999 Aristarchus, and the telescope Aristarchos are named after him.

<text>The Lady Eve is a 1941 American screwball comedy film written and directed by Preston Sturges and starring Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. The film is based on a story by Monckton Hoffe about a mismatched couple who meet on board an ocean liner. Regarded amongst the greatest films of all time, &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1994 by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

Jean Harrington is a beautiful con artist. Along with her equally larcenous father, &quot;Colonel&quot; Harrington, and his partner Gerald, she is sailing on an ocean liner with the intention to fleece rich, naive Charles Pike, the heir to the Pike&#x27;s Pale (&quot;The Ale That Won for Yale&quot;) fortune. Charles is a woman-shy snake expert just returning from a year-long expedition up the Amazon. The young women aboard the ship compete for his attention, but Charles is more concerned with reading about snakes.

Jean meets Charles by tripping him as he passes, and he is soon smitten with her. After Jean runs off, terrified by a real snake that Charles brought on board and has gotten loose in his cabin, the two share a steamy scene in her cabin.

Charles&#x27; minder Muggsy suspects that Jean is a trickster looking to steal from Charles, but Charles refuses to believe him. Then, despite the planned con, Jean falls in love with Charles and shields him from her card sharp father. Muggsy discovers the truth and presents proof to Charlie, who dumps Jean.

Furious at being spurned, Jean soon re-enters Charles&#x27; life masquerading as the posh Lady Eve Sidwich, niece of Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith, another con man who has been swindling the rich of Connecticut. Jean takes on an English accent, determined to torment Charles mercilessly; as she puts it, &quot;I&#x27;ve got some unfinished business with him — I need him like the axe needs the turkey.&quot;

When Charles meets &quot;Lady Eve&quot;, he is so bewildered at her resemblance to Jean that he constantly trips and falls over himself. Although Muggsy tries to convince him that &quot;she&#x27;s the same dame&quot;, Charles reasons that Jean would not come close to his home without at least disguising herself more thoroughly. Then, after Sir Alfred feeds him a story that the Lady Eve is Jean&#x27;s long-lost sister, Charles accepts the resemblance. After a brief courtship, they marry, right on Jean&#x27;s schedule. And just as she had planned, on the train to their honeymoon, &quot;Eve&quot; begins to confess her past, continuously dropping names of many old boyfriends and lovers. A disgusted Charles jumps off the train.

Jean&#x27;s con team urges her to close the deal by pursuing a huge divorce settlement, but she tells Charles&#x27; father on the phone that she wants no money, but only wants Charles to tell her that their marriage is over in person. Charles refuses. Jean is then told by Charles&#x27; father that Charles is departing on another ocean voyage. She arranges passage for herself and her father, and meets Charles again by tripping him as he passes, just as they had met before. Charles is overjoyed to see Jean again. He kisses her and takes her hand, and they run to her cabin, where they mutually affirm their love for each other. As the cabin door closes, Charles confesses that he has no right to be in her cabin because he is married. Jean replies, &quot;So am I, darling, so am I.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==

&quot;The Lady Eve&quot; is loosely based on a 19-page story by Monckton Hoffe called &quot;Two Bad Hats&quot;, which was also the working title of the film. Sturges was assigned in 1938 to write a script based on Hoffe&#x27;s story, with Claudette Colbert expected to be the star. Sturges and Paramount producer Albert Lewin had some written disagreement in 1939 about the development of the script. Lewin wrote to Sturges, &quot;[T]he first two-thirds of the script, in spite of the high quality of your jokes, will require an almost one hundred percent rewrite.&quot; Sturges objected, and eventually Lewin acceded, writing, &quot;Follow your witty nose, my boy; it will lead you and me and Paramount to the Elysian pastures of popular entertainment.&quot;

The Hays Office initially rejected the script because of &quot;the definite suggestion of a sex affair between your two leads&quot; that lacked &quot;compensating moral values&quot;, and a revised script was submitted and approved.

At some point, the studio wanted Brian Aherne for the male lead, and Joel McCrea, Madeleine Carroll and Paulette Goddard were under consideration as of July 1940. But in August 1940, Fred MacMurray and Madeleine Carroll were announced as the film&#x27;s co-stars. In September, Darryl Zanuck lent Henry Fonda to co-star with Goddard, who was then replaced by Barbara Stanwyck.
Production took place from October 21 to December 5, 1940. According to Donald Spoto in &quot;Madcap: The Life of Preston Sturges&quot;, Sturges &quot;... invariably paraded on [the] set with a colorful beret or a felt cap with a feather protruding, a white cashmere scarf blowing gaily round his neck and a print shirt in loud hues ... the reason for the peculiar outfits, he told visitors, was that they facilitated crew members finding him amid the crowds of actors, technicians, and the public.&quot; Stanwyck compared Sturges&#x27; set to &quot;a carnival&quot;. In his biography of Stanwyck, author Axel Madsen wrote, &quot;The set was so ebullient that instead of going to their trailers between setups, the players relaxed in canvas chairs with their sparkling director, listening to his fascinating stories or going over their lines with him. To get into mood for Barbara&#x27;s bedroom scene, Sturges wore a bathrobe.&quot;

Location shooting for the opening jungle scene took place at Lake Baldwin of the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden in Arcadia, California. In that scene, Fonda&#x27;s character refers to Professor Marsdit, whose last name is an anagram of Raymond L. Ditmars of the American Museum of Natural History, a well-known reptile expert and popular science writer of the time.

==Release==
===Theatrical release===
The film premiered in New York City on February 25, 1941, and went into general release on March 21. It was marketed with a number of taglines, including: &quot;When you deal a fast shuffle ... love is in the cards.&quot; The film ranked among the top-grossing films of the year.

===Home video===
&quot;The Lady Eve&quot; was released on home video in the United States on July 12, 1990, and was rereleased on June 30, 1993. Despite issues with the condition of the surviving original film elements, the film was scanned in 4K and issued on Blu-ray disc by Criterion on July 14, 2020.

==Reception and themes==
After &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; premiered at the Rialto Theatre, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Bosley Crowther characterized the film as &quot;a sparkling romantic comedy&quot;. He further described the director&#x27;s work: &quot;It isn&#x27;t often that this corner has good reason to bang a gong and holler &#x27;Hurry, hurry, hurry!&#x27; As a matter of fact, it is all too rare indeed that we have even moderate provocation to mark a wonder of the cinematic world. Too many of the films on which we comment boil down to woeful mediocrity, and too many of the people who make them betray a depressing weariness.&quot;

More than 50 years later, Roger Ebert gave the film high praise: &quot;If I were asked to name the single scene in all of romantic comedy that was sexiest and funniest at the same time, I would advise beginning at six seconds past the 20-minute mark in Preston Sturges&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;.&quot;

Some have identified a theme of gender inversion, with Jean Harrington clearly in control for the majority of the film until her feelings get in the way of her original intentions. Until she realizes that she loves Charles, there is little sense of the struggle between equals that typifies most romantic comedies. The film has been lauded for a unique blend of slapstick and satire. Film scholars have observed the theme of the fall of man implied by the film&#x27;s title; in the literal sense, the fall is evidenced in Pike&#x27;s frequent pratfalls, and figuratively, he falls from innocence as he is lured into Jean&#x27;s deceptive plots.

Film critic Andrew Sarris identifies the theme of deceptiveness throughout the film, with things as small as the distinction, or lack thereof, between beer and ale, as well as the various disguises of Jean Harrington, adding depth to the plot line. Most of the characters have two names (Charles is Hopsie, Jean is Eve Sidwich); this lack of recognition sets the stage for the storyline. Sturges repeatedly suggests that the &quot;lowliest boob could rise to the top with the right degree of luck, bluff and fraud&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
At the 14th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Original Story for Monckton Hoffe, but &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; (Harry Segall) proved victorious. The National Board of Review nominated the film for Best Picture, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; named it as the best film of 1941.

In 1994, &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2008, &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; was selected by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as among the 500 greatest movies of all time, and one of the best 1,000 by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2012, the film ranked #110 on &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;&#x27;s critics&#x27; poll, and #174 on the directors&#x27; poll as selected by the British Film Institute.

&quot;The Lady Eve&quot; was listed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of its &quot;All-TIME 100 Movies&quot;. The film ranked 59th on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest films of all time. FilmSite.org, a subsidiary of American Movie Classics, placed &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; on their list of the 100 greatest films. Films101.com ranked &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; as the 92nd best of all time.

In 2006, the Writers Guild of America ranked &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; as the 52nd best written film of all time.

&quot;The Lady Eve&quot; appears on two of the American Film Institute&#x27;s lists and was nominated for several others:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies (1998) – Nominated
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs (2000) – #55
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Passions (2002) – #26
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes (2005)
** &quot;I need him like the axe needs the turkey.&quot; – Nominated
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) (2007) – Nominated
* AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 (2008) – Nominated Romantic Comedy Film

==Influences==
In 1956, the plot of &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; was recycled for the film &quot;The Birds and the Bees&quot; starring George Gobel, Mitzi Gaynor and David Niven. Preston Sturges received a co-writer credit for the film, although he did not actually participate in the project.

The plot was employed as the model for &quot;Corrupting Dr. Nice&quot;, a 1997 science fiction novel by John Kessel involving time travel.

Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s Jean Harrington was one of the key reference points that James Mangold came up with for Phoebe Waller-Bridge to employ in her performance as Helena Shaw in the 2023 film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot;, the fifth and last &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movie.

==Radio adaptation==
&quot;The Lady Eve&quot; was presented on &quot;Hollywood Star Time&quot; on September 21, 1946, with Joan Blondell and John Lund in the starring roles.

<text>Lambchops is an 8-minute American comedy Vitaphone short subject released in October 1929, which depicts a vaudeville performance by Burns and Allen of the comedy routine &quot;Lambchops&quot; written by Al Boasberg. The work&#x27;s copyright was renewed in 1957, and it entered the American public domain on January 1, 2025.

==Plot==

==Cast==
* George Burns as George the Boyfriend (as Burns)
* Gracie Allen as Gracie the Girlfriend (as Allen)

==Production==
The night that they arrived in New York after their first tour of England with their vaudeville routines, George Burns and Gracie Allen attended a party where they were approached by their agent Arthur Lyons, who asked if they would be interested in filming a short for Warner Brothers the following morning. Comedian Fred Allen was slated to film one of his comedy routines but had come down with the flu, leaving the studio in the lurch. Burns was told that the job paid $1,700, so he said yes on the spot. &quot;I&#x27;d never heard of $1,700 in my life, especially for nine minutes&#x27; work,&quot; Burns quipped.

When they arrived on the set of the Vitaphone studio in Brooklyn the next morning, Burns was shocked to see his childhood buddy Murray Roth, who was directing. Burns did not believe Roth was in showbiz, let alone a film director, so Roth shouted &quot;Lights!&quot; and the set lights come on. &quot;Off!&quot; he shouted, and the stage went black. This glimpse of the living room set that they&#x27;d be shooting on perplexed Burns due to his familiarity with theatre and street performance. His toupée was still in his luggage, which he had not had time to pick up from the loading dock following their trip. To explain why he was wearing a hat, he quickly rewrote the comedy duo&#x27;s &quot;Lambchops&quot; routine to begin with himself and Gracie coming into the room and looking for the audience.

==Reception==
According to George Burns, Warner Bros. was not impressed with the short, which he himself described as, &quot;not the greatest&quot;, so they were not asked to shoot any more for the studio. Burns, however was so enamored by the paycheck that he actively sought out more film work and was quickly embraced by Paramount Pictures, with whom Burns and Allen subsequently released a whole series of short subjects.

In 1999 &quot;Lambchops&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Lambchops&quot; was released on DVD in October 2007, on disc three of a three-disc 80th anniversary edition of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;.
* 2007: &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, Three-Disc Deluxe Edition. Burbank, California: Warner Home Video.

<doc id="74860" wikidata="Q182518" url="?curid=74860" title="A Hard Day's Night (album)">
<text>A Hard Day&#x27;s Night is the third studio album by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 10 July 1964 by Parlophone, with side one containing songs from the soundtrack to their film of the same name. The American version of the album was released two weeks earlier, on 26 June 1964 by United Artists Records, with a different track listing including some from George Martin&#x27;s film score. &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; is the band&#x27;s first album to contain all-original material, penned by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.

The album includes the song &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, with its distinctive opening chord, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, both transatlantic number-one singles for the band. Several songs feature George Harrison playing a Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar, with its sound influencing the Byrds and other groups in the emerging folk rock and jangle pop genres.

==Recording==

Shortly after the release of &quot;With the Beatles&quot; (1963), the Beatles were at EMI Pathé Marconi Studios in Paris on 29 January 1964 for their first recording session outside of London. Here, they recorded German-language versions of their two most recent singles, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot;, titled &quot;Komm, gib mir deine Hand&quot; and &quot;Sie liebt dich&quot;, respectively. According to their producer, George Martin, this was done as &quot;they couldn&#x27;t sell large quantities of records [in Germany] unless they were sung in German&quot;. Also recorded—in English—was Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, which was completed in only four takes. Shortly afterward, the band gave their first live performance in the United States on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on 9 February. They gave more US performances before returning to the United Kingdom on 22 February.

The Beatles were set to begin filming their first major feature film on 2 March 1964. According to historian Mark Lewisohn, the band were set to record songs for both the film and a tie-in LP, of which the songs from the film were completed first. On 25 February—lead guitarist George Harrison&#x27;s 21st birthday—the band were back at London&#x27;s EMI Studios, recording John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot; for release as the B-side of &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;. The band also attempted &quot;And I Love Her&quot; and &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; on this day and again the following day, with the former finalised on 27 February. Two more songs from the film, &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; and &quot;If I Fell&quot;, were recorded on this day.

On 1 March 1964, the Beatles recorded three songs in three hours: &quot;I&#x27;m Happy Just to Dance with You&quot; for the film, featuring Harrison on lead vocal; a cover of Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;; and Lennon&#x27;s &quot;I Call Your Name&quot;, which was originally given to Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas the previous year. Mono and stereo mixing was carried out over the following two weeks. The &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; / &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot; single was released on 16 March and topped charts worldwide. Taking a break for filming, drummer Ringo Starr coined the phrase &quot;a hard day&#x27;s night&quot;, providing the film with its title. Lennon and McCartney wrote a song based on the title, which was recorded at EMI on 16 April and mixed four days later.

On 1 June, with the film completed and the band returning from holidays, the Beatles returned to EMI, recording the remaining songs for the tie-in LP, with outtakes appearing on the &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; EP. Covers of Carl Perkins&#x27; &quot;Matchbox&quot;, with Starr on lead vocals, and Larry Williams&#x27; &quot;Slow Down&quot;, appeared on the EP, while Lennon&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Instead&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Back&quot; appeared on the LP. The following day on 2 June, the band completed Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Any Time at All&quot; and &quot;When I Get Home&quot;, and McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Things We Said Today&quot;. The band spent the remainder of June and July touring internationally.

==Content==
Musically, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; eschews the rock and roll cover songs of the band&#x27;s previous albums for a predominantly pop sound. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Dave Donnelly observes &quot;short, peppy&quot; pop songs characterised by layered vocals, immediate choruses, and understated instrumentation. According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Tom Ewing, the lack of rock and roll covers allows listeners to &quot;take the group&#x27;s new sound purely on its own modernist terms&quot;, with audacious &quot;chord choices&quot;, powerful harmonies, &quot;gleaming&quot; guitar, and &quot;Northern&quot; harmonica. Music journalist Robert Christgau writes that Lennon–McCartney&#x27;s songs were &quot;more sophisticated musically&quot; than before. It also features Harrison playing a Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar, a sound that was influential on the Byrds and other bands in the folk rock explosion of 1965.

Side one of the LP contains the songs from the film soundtrack. Side two contains songs written for, but not included in, the film, although a 1980s re-release of the film includes a prologue before the opening credits with &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Instead&quot; on the soundtrack. The title of the album and film was the accidental creation of Starr. According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine: &quot;I was going home in the car and [film director] Dick Lester suggested the title, &#x27;Hard Day&#x27;s Night&#x27; from something Ringo had said. I had used it in &quot;In His Own Write&quot;, but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny ... just said it. So Dick Lester said, &#x27;We are going to use that title.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; is the first Beatles album to feature entirely original compositions, and the only one where all the songs were written by Lennon–McCartney. Lennon is the primary author of nine of the thirteen tracks on the album, as well as being the lead singer on these same nine tracks (although Paul McCartney sings lead on the title track&#x27;s middle-eight). Lennon and McCartney co-wrote &quot;I&#x27;m Happy Just to Dance with You&quot;, sung by Harrison, while McCartney wrote &quot;And I Love Her&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; and &quot;Things We Said Today&quot;. It is one of three Beatles albums, along with &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, in which Starr does not sing lead vocal on any songs. (Starr sang the lead vocal on &quot;Matchbox&quot; during the sessions; it appeared instead on the &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; EP.) It is also one of three Beatles albums, along with &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;, in which Harrison does not contribute to the songwriting.

==Critical reception and legacy==

According to music critic Richie Unterberger, writing for AllMusic:
George Harrison&#x27;s resonant 12-string electric guitar leads [on &quot;A Hard&#x27;s Day&#x27;s Night&quot;] were hugely influential; the movie helped persuade the Byrds, then folksingers, to plunge all out into rock &amp; roll, and the Beatles would be hugely influential on the folk-rock explosion of 1965. The Beatles&#x27; success, too, had begun to open the US market for fellow English bands like the Rolling Stones, the Animals, and the Kinks, and inspired young American groups like the Beau Brummels, Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, and others to mount a challenge of their own with self-penned material that owed a great debt to Lennon–McCartney.

In his book &quot;Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!: The Story of Pop Music from Bill Haley to Beyoncé&quot;, Bob Stanley identifies &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; as the album that best captures the band&#x27;s early-career appeal. He writes:
If you had to explain the Beatles&#x27; impact to a stranger, you&#x27;d play them the soundtrack to &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. The songs, conceived in a hotel room in a spare couple of weeks between up-ending the British class system and conquering America, were full of bite and speed. There was adventure, knowingness, love, and abundant charm.

&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was included in the list of &quot;100 Essential Rock Albums&quot; compiled by musicologists Charlie Gillett and Simon Frith for &quot;ZigZag&quot; magazine in 1975, and is one of the &quot;Treasure Island albums&quot; featured in Greil Marcus&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;Stranded&quot;. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; at number 5 on its list &quot;The 100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. That same year, it appeared at number 22 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Reissues==
On 26 February 1987, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was officially released on compact disc in mono, along with &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, &quot;With the Beatles&quot;, and &quot;Beatles for Sale.&quot; Having been available only as an import in the US in the past, the 13 track UK version of the album was also issued in the US on LP and cassette on 21 July 1987. Stereo mixes of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, and &quot;And I Love Her&quot; had been made available on the first compact disc issue of &quot;1962–1966&quot; in 1993. Most of the rest of the tracks appeared in stereo on compact disc for the first time with the release of the box set &quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 1&quot; in 2004.

On 9 September 2009, a remastered version of this album was released and was the first time the album appeared in stereo on compact disc in its entirety. This album is also included in &quot;The Beatles: Stereo Box Set&quot;. A remastered mono version of the original UK album was part of &quot;The Beatles in Mono&quot; box set. A 60th anniversary reissue of the album was released on 19 October 2024 to celebrate National Album Day.

==North American release==
The American version of the album was released on 26 June 1964 by United Artists Records in both mono and stereo, the fourth Beatles album in the United States. The album went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, spending 14 weeks there, the longest run of any album that year. United Artists rushed the album into stores over a month before the film&#x27;s US premiere; as a result, the Beatles had both the number-one album and number-one single in the country when &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; opened on 11 August 1964.

All seven songs from the film, the first side of the UK album, were featured along with &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Instead&quot;, which, although written for the film, was cut at the last minute. The American version also included four orchestral instrumental versions of Lennon and McCartney songs arranged by George Martin conducting an orchestra of studio musicians: &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;, &quot;And I Love Her&quot;, &quot;Ringo&#x27;s Theme&quot; (featuring Vic Flick on lead guitar), and &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. After EMI acquired United Artists Records, this album was reissued in August 1980 on the Capitol label, catalogue SW-11921.

While the stereo version of the album included the instrumental tracks in true stereo, the Beatles&#x27; own recordings appeared as electronically rechannelled stereo recordings made from the mono releases. The 1980 Capitol Records reissue used the same master tape as the original United Artists LP release in fake stereo, despite the availability of several tracks with official true stereo remixes. True stereo versions of most of the songs had been issued on the Capitol album &quot;Something New&quot;, released in July 1964. &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; and &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; finally appeared in stereo on the 1970 Apple Records compilation &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. The song &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; did not appear in true stereo in the US until the 1982 Capitol compilation album &quot;Reel Music&quot;. In 2014, the American version of the &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; album was released on CD individually and in a boxed set of all the other US Beatles albums to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Beatles first US visit. This CD reissue features all of the songs in both true stereo and mono mixes. In 2024, the mono variant of the album was reissued on Vinyl as part of the box set The 1964 U.S. Albums in Mono, using the original masters. 

In 2000, the 1964 North American release of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; by The Beatles on the United Artists label was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<doc id="74861" wikidata="Q2697766" url="?curid=74861" title="The Land Beyond the Sunset">
<text>The Land Beyond the Sunset is a 1912 short, silent drama film which tells the story of a young boy, oppressed by his grandmother, who goes on an outing in the country with a social welfare group. It stars Martin Fuller, Mrs. William Bechtel, Walter Edwin, and Bigelow Cooper. Produced by Edison Studios in collaboration with the Fresh Air Fund, the screenplay was written by Dorothy G. Shore and directed by Harold M. Shaw.

In 2000, &quot;The Land Beyond the Sunset&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is included on the DVD &quot;Treasures from American Film Archives&quot; (2000).

==Plot==

Joe is an impoverished New York newsboy who lives with his abusive grandmother. While selling papers, he is given a ticket for a children&#x27;s excursion sponsored by the Fresh Air Fund. The next morning, Joe sneaks out of his tenement home to join the excursion, where he sees the countryside and the ocean for the first time. After a picnic, an adult volunteer reads to the children a fanciful tale from storybook, a tale about a young prince who is beaten by an old witch. A group of fairies rescues the boy, take him to a boat, and sail off for &quot;the Land Beyond the Sunset, where he lived happily ever after.&quot; Joe imagines himself as the boy in the story. When the other children and adults begin their return to the city, Joe manages to get the book, linger, and then hide, afraid that his grandmother will be mad at him and dreading the prospect of returning to his wretched life in the city&#x27;s slums. Next he wanders to the beach, where he finds a rowboat and decides to embark alone on a voyage to the wonderful, far-off land. He pushes the oarless boat into the water and climbs aboard. The film ends with a distant view of Joe, holding the storybook against his chest, slowly drifting out to sea toward the horizon and most likely to his death.

<text>Lassie Come Home is a 1943 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Technicolor feature film starring Roddy McDowall and canine actor Pal, in a story about the profound bond between Yorkshire boy Joe Carraclough and his rough collie, Lassie. The film was directed by Fred M. Wilcox from a screenplay by Hugo Butler based upon the 1940 novel &quot;Lassie Come-Home&quot; by Eric Knight. The film was the first in a series of seven MGM films starring &quot;Lassie.&quot;

In 1993, &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and recommended for preservation.

The original film saw a sequel, &quot;Son of Lassie&quot; in 1945 with five other films following at intervals through the 1940s. A British remake of the 1943 movie was released in 2005 as &quot;Lassie&quot; to moderate success. The film has been released to VHS and DVD.

== Plot ==
Set in Depression-era Yorkshire, England, Mr and Mrs Carraclough are hit by hard times and forced to sell their collie, Lassie, to the rich Duke of Rudling, who has always admired her. Young Joe Carraclough grows despondent at the loss of his companion.

Lassie will have nothing to do with the Duke, however, and finds ways to escape her kennels and return to Joe. The Duke finally carries Lassie to his home hundreds of miles distant in Scotland. There, his granddaughter Priscilla senses the dog&#x27;s unhappiness and arranges her escape.

Lassie then sets off for a long trek to her Yorkshire home. She faces many perils along the way, dog catchers and a violent storm, but also meets kind people who offer her aid and comfort. At the end, when Joe has given up hope of ever seeing his dog again, the weary Lassie returns to her favorite resting place in the schoolyard at home. There, Lassie is joyfully reunited with the boy she loves.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

The film was shot in Washington state and Monterey, California, while the rapids scene was shot on the San Joaquin River. It also features scenes from the former Janss Conejo Ranch in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California. Additional photography occurred in Big Bear Lake.
During the film&#x27;s production, MGM executives previewing the dailies were said to be so moved that they ordered more scenes to be added to &quot;this wonderful motion picture.&quot;

Some sources say that, initially, a female collie was selected for the title role, but was replaced when the dog began to shed excessively during shooting of the film in the summer. The trainer, Rudd Weatherwax, then substituted the male collie, Pal, in the role of &quot;Lassie&quot;. Pal had been hired to perform the rapids stunt and, being male, looked more impressive in the part. Still other accounts, such as a 1943 &quot;New York Times&quot; article written while the film was in production, say that Pal was cast by director Fred Wilcox after first being rejected, because no other dog performed satisfactorily with the &quot;near human attributes&quot; he sought for the canine title role. Weatherwax would later receive all rights to the Lassie name and trademark in lieu of back pay owed him by MGM.

== Music ==
In 2010, Film Score Monthly released the complete scores of the seven Lassie feature films released by MGM between 1943 and 1955 as well as Elmer Bernstein’s score for &quot;It&#x27;s a Dog&#x27;s Life&quot; (1955) in the CD collection &quot;Lassie Come Home: The Canine Cinema Collection&quot;, limited to 1000 copies. 
Due to the era when these scores were recorded, nearly half of the music masters have been lost so the scores had to be reconstructed and restored from the best available sources, mainly the Music and Effects tracks as well as monaural ¼″ tapes.

The score for &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; was composed by Daniele Amfitheatrof.

The movie was a big hit. According to MGM records it earned $2,613,000 in the US and Canada and $1,904,000 overseas, resulting in a profit of $2,249,000.

The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography, Color and later the character of Lassie received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6368 Hollywood Blvd. In 1993, &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Bosley Crowther in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of October 8, 1943 uniformly praised the performers and production, noting that the film &quot;tells the story of a boy and a dog, tells it with such poignance and simple beauty that only the hardest heart can fail to be moved.&quot;

Almost 50 years after the film&#x27;s release, &quot;Parade&quot; discussed its lasting cultural impact, quoting the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; which said the film launched Pal on &quot;the most spectacular canine career in film history&quot;. &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; was also cited as a cultural icon in Jane and Michael Stern&#x27;s 1992 book, &quot;Encyclopedia of Pop Culture&quot;.

<doc id="74864" wikidata="Q444242" url="?curid=74864" title="The Last of the Mohicans (1920 American film)">
<text>The Last of the Mohicans is a 1920 American silent adventure drama film written by Robert A. Dillon, adapted from James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s 1826 novel of the same name. Clarence Brown and Maurice Tourneur co-directed the film. (Brown took over the direction of the film after Tourneur injured himself in a fall.) It is a story of two English sisters meeting danger on the frontier of the American colonies, in and around the fort commanded by their father. The adventure film stars Wallace Beery, Barbara Bedford, Lillian Hall, Alan Roscoe and Boris Karloff in one of his earliest silent film roles (playing an Indian brave). Barbara Bedford later married her co-star in the film, Alan Roscoe in real life. The production was shot near Big Bear Lake and in Yosemite Valley.

The film was well received at the time of its release. Film historian William K. Everson considers &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; to be a masterpiece. In 1995, the film was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

==Plot==

In 1757, in the midst of the French and Indian War, three French divisions and their Huron Indian allies are advancing on Fort William Henry, a British stronghold south of Lake George in the colony of New York. Chingachgook sends his son Uncas, the last living warrior of the Mohican tribe, to warn the fort&#x27;s commander, Colonel Munro, of the imminent danger. Uncas is admired by Munro&#x27;s daughter Cora, much to the displeasure of her suitor, Captain Randolph.

Upon receiving Munro&#x27;s plea for assistance, General Webb dispatches a relief force of 3000 men to Fort William Henry with the Munro sisters, but with the aid of an Indian runner named Magua, the sisters and Major Heyward take a shortcut through the wilderness. Magua, who is a Huron sympathizer, then pretends to lose his way. In the forest they encounter Uncas, Chingachgook and the hunter and scout Hawkeye, accompanied by an eccentric preacher named David Gamut. When Heyward asks for directions to Fort Edward, the men become suspicious of Magua who, like all Indians in the area, should have an intimate knowledge of the terrain. Their fears of treachery are confirmed when they discover that Magua has disappeared.

Uncas and Hawkeye conceal Heyward and the women in a cave, but Magua and his men find the hiding place, and after a fierce firefight the women are captured. Magua offers to spare &quot;Golden Hair&quot; (Alice) if Cora will become his squaw; but Uncas, Chingachgook and Hawkeye counterattack and rescue the hostages. Although they leave Magua for dead, he is actually uninjured.

The hostages and their rescuers arrive at Fort William Henry at the same time as the column of troops, but the situation is still dire. The only thing keeping the besiegers at bay is a formidable gun emplacement on the left rampart. The cowardly Captain Randolph informs Montcalm, the French commander, that the rampart guns are nonfunctional, leaving Munro no choice but to surrender the fort. Though promised safe passage for the women and children, the Hurons, under the influence of French-supplied whiskey, slaughter the civilians and torch the fort.

Magua kidnaps the Munro sisters for a second time and flees. Uncas and Hawkeye pursue him, but Magua reaches a neutral Delaware village. The dispute is taken before a Delaware council of three; their judgment is that Cora be released to Uncas, and that Alice remain with Magua. To save her sister, Cora offers to take her place. Uncas vows that Magua will not leave with his true love, but by Delaware law, Magua is protected until sundown.

That night, Cora escapes and is pursued by Magua to the edge of a precipice. She threatens to jump if he approaches, so Magua waits patiently for her to fall asleep. When she does, he grabs her arm. She flings herself off the cliff, but Magua still has hold of her arms. When Uncas appears, the situation is reversed: Cora tries to save herself, but Magua uses his knife to pry her fingers loose, and she falls to her death. In the ensuing fight, Magua stabs Uncas, whose body rolls down the embankment to rest near Cora&#x27;s. Before dying, Uncas reaches forth and takes Cora&#x27;s hand in his. Magua flees when Chingachgook and Hawkeye arrive, but Hawkeye shoots him dead.

At Cora and Uncas&#x27;s burial ceremony, Munro laments the passing of his daughter and Chingachgook mourns for his son, the last of the Mohicans.

==Critical assessment==

The Maurice Tourneur and Clarence Brown adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s 1826 historical novel retains its high stature among film historians and &quot;still considered to be the best film adaption of Cooper’s novel.”

Film historian and biographer Charles Higham offered high praise for the directorial “sophistication” and “daring” in the development of the Cora Munro (Barbara Bedford) character:

Acknowledging the “strengths and weaknesses” evident in every cinematic treatment of the famous novel—adaptations of the novel appeared as early as 1911— including the George B. Seitz version in 1936 and the 1992 production by Michael Mann—film critic David Sterritt reports “that for pure visual storytelling and a memorably filmed climax, the silent movie by Tourneur and Brown has proven hard to beat.”

<text>The Last Picture Show is a 1971 American coming-of-age drama film directed by Peter Bogdanovich and co-written by Bogdanovich and Larry McMurtry, adapted from the 1966 semi-autobiographical novel by McMurtry. The film&#x27;s ensemble cast includes Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Ellen Burstyn, Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman, and Cybill Shepherd. Set in a small town in northern Texas from November 1951 to October 1952, it is a story of two high school seniors and long-time friends, Sonny Crawford (Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Bridges).

&quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; was theatrically released on October 22, 1971, by Columbia Pictures. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $29 million on a $1.3 million budget, and was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Johnson and Bridges, and Best Supporting Actress for Burstyn and Leachman, with Johnson and Leachman winning.

Bogdanovich directed a 1990 sequel, &quot;Texasville&quot;, based on McMurtry&#x27;s 1987 novel of the same name and featuring much of the original film&#x27;s cast reprising their roles; &quot;Texasville&quot; failed to match the critical or commercial success of its predecessor. In 1998, the Library of Congress selected &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1951, Sonny Crawford and Duane Jackson are high school seniors and best friends the small oil town of Anarene, Texas. Duane is dating Jacy Farrow, the prettiest girl in town, with the richest parents. Sonny breaks up with his girlfriend due to his secret crush on Jacy.

At a Christmas dance, Jacy is invited by Lester Marlow to a skinny-dipping pool party at Bobby Sheen&#x27;s, a wealthy young man and seemingly better prospect than Duane. At the dance, Sonny kisses Ruth Popper, the depressed middle-aged wife of his high school coach.

Duane, Sonny and others take their young, mentally disabled friend, Billy, to a prostitute to lose his virginity. Returning him home, local businessman Sam &quot;The Lion&quot; is angered by their treatment of Billy, who habitually sweeps Anarene&#x27;s main street. He forbids the group from entering any of his businesses, the only entertainment in town: the pool hall, movie theater, and café. Later, when Sam catches Sonny visiting Billy and Genevieve the waitress at the café, Sonny apologizes and Sam lifts the ban on him.

Bobby makes an advance on Jacy, but refuses to have sex with her because she is a virgin. On New Year&#x27;s Eve weekend, Duane and Sonny impulsively drive to Mexico. Before leaving, the nostalgic Sam gives them some extra money to enjoy themselves. When the boys return hungover and tired on Monday morning, they learn that Sam died suddenly of a stroke the day before. Sam leaves Sonny the pool hall in his will.

Jacy invites Duane to a motel room for sex, as she wants to be accepted into Bobby&#x27;s libertine circle. He is unable to get an erection, so she scolds him. Later, they try again and Duane performs briefly, just enough for Jacy to lose her virginity. She breaks up with him by phone, hoping to become involved with Bobby.

However, Jacy learns that Bobby has already married another girl. Out of boredom and feeling rejected, she has sex with Abilene, her father Gene&#x27;s roughneck foreman and her mother&#x27;s lover. When he drops Jacy off he is brutally cold. Upon entering the house, Jacy&#x27;s mother Lois catches her and Jacy begins to cry. They both complain about men’s brutality.

Upset over the breakup, Duane enlists in the Army and is scheduled to serve in the Korean War after basic training. In his absence, Jacy goes for Sonny, who abruptly drops Ruth and dreams of marrying her. Duane returns home on leave, driving a new Mercury. He fights with Sonny over Jacy, smashing a beer bottle into Sonny&#x27;s eye, sending him to the hospital. During his recovery, he refuses to see Ruth when she visits.

Jacy and Sonny elope to Oklahoma. While driving to their honeymoon, Jacy reveals she left a letter to her parents, telling them of their entire plan. Jacy and Sonny are stopped by a state trooper who takes them to the Farrows’. Gene angrily berates Sonny and drives Jacy home. Sonny rides back with Lois, who reveals Sam was her first true love. She suggests Sonny would be much better off with Ruth than with Jacy. The marriage is annulled and a short time passes.

On Duane&#x27;s last night of leave, Sonny makes amends with him and reveals that Jacy has left for college in Dallas. They go to the theater on its final night. The last picture show is &quot;Red River&quot;.

The next morning, when Sonny sees Duane off, Duane asks Sonny to take care of his Mercury after Sonny admits that he and Jacy &quot;never made it to the motel.&quot; As Sonny opens the pool hall, he hears brakes squealing outside. Billy was struck and killed by a truck when he was sweeping the road. The local townsmen surround Billy&#x27;s body and coldly blame the dead boy for being stupid and careless. Grief-stricken, Sonny yells at them for their behavior and carefully carries Billy&#x27;s body away, covering his face with his letterman jacket.

Angry and depressed with his life, Sonny drives to the city limits. He slowly changes his mind and returns, parking near Ruth&#x27;s. He shyly asks to come in for a cup of coffee. Depressed, she has shuttered herself inside.

Ruth lets him in, then explodes in hurt and anger. She notices that Sonny is completely devastated. Demanding he look at her, he does and gently touches her hand. Ruth&#x27;s anger melts away and she comforts him. Her last words are “Never you mind, honey. Never you mind” as the film ends.

==Cast==
==Production==
Going into &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; Peter Bogdanovich was a 31-year-old stage actor, film essayist, and critic. Bogdanovich had directed one film, &quot;Targets&quot; (also known as &quot;Before I Die&quot;), working with his wife and collaborator, Polly Platt. As Bogdanovich later explained to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, while waiting in a cashier&#x27;s line in a drugstore, he happened to look at the rack of paperbacks and his eye fell on an interesting title, &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;. The back of the book said it was about &quot;kids growing up in Texas&quot; and Bogdanovich decided that it did not interest him and put it back. A few weeks later, actor Sal Mineo handed Platt a copy of the book. &quot;I always wanted to be in this&quot;, he said, &quot;but I&#x27;m a little too old now&quot;, said Mineo, who recommended that Platt and Bogdanovich make it into a film. According to Bogdanovich, Platt said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how you make it into a picture, but it&#x27;s a good book.&quot; Bogdanovich, McMurtry, and Platt adapted the novel into the film of the same name.

Stephen Friedman was a lawyer with Columbia Pictures but keen to break into film production as he had bought the film rights to the book, so Bogdanovich hired him as producer.

After discussing the proposed film with Orson Welles, his houseguest at the time, Bogdanovich agreed with him that shooting the film in black and white would work aesthetically, which by then was an unusual choice.

The film was shot in Larry McMurtry&#x27;s small hometown of Archer City located in north-central Texas near the Oklahoma state line. McMurtry had renamed the town &quot;Thalia&quot; in his book; Bogdanovich dubbed it Anarene (for a ghost town south of Archer City). The similarity to famed cowtown Abilene, Kansas, in Howard Hawks&#x27; &quot;Red River&quot; (1948) was intentional. &quot;Red River&quot; again is tied in as &quot;the last picture show&quot;, which Sonny and Duane watch at the end of the film.

After shooting wrapped, Bogdanovich went back to Los Angeles to edit the film footage on a Moviola. Bogdanovich has said that he edited the entire film himself, but refused to credit himself as editor, reasoning that director and co-writer were enough. When informed that the Motion Picture Editors Guild required an editor credit, he suggested Donn Cambern, who had been editing another film, &quot;Drive, He Said&quot; (1971), in the next office and had helped Bogdanovich with some purchasing paperwork concerning the film&#x27;s opticals. Cambern disputes this, stating that Bogdanovich did do an edit of the film, which he screened for a selection of guests, including Jack Nicholson, Bob Rafelson and himself. The consensus was the film was going to be great, but needed further editing to achieve its full potential. Cambern claims Bogdanovich invited him to do so, during which he made significant contributions to the film&#x27;s final form.

Bogdanovich obtained a rare waiver from the Directors Guild of America to have his name appear only at the end of the film, after the actors&#x27; credits, as he felt it was more meaningful for the audience to see their names after their performances.

===Music===
The film features entirely diegetic music, including many songs of Hank Williams Sr. and other country and western and 1950s popular music recording artists. In interviews, Bogdanovich emphasized that a lot of attention was paid to the music being accurate and contemporary to the narrated time span between November 1951 to October 1952, and that no songs were used that in reality were released later than that.

==Reception and legacy==
===Box office===
The film earned $13.1 million in domestic rentals in North America.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars in his original review and named it the best film of 1971. He later added it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list, writing that &quot;the film is above all an evocation of mood. It is about a town with no reason to exist, and people with no reason to live there. The only hope is in transgression.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;lovely film&quot; that &quot;rediscovers a time, a place, a film form—and a small but important part of the American experience.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film four stars out of four and wrote: &quot;Like few films in recent years, Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; ends with us wanting to see more of the people who occupy the small town world that is Anarene, Tex. in 1951. This emotion is not easily achieved. It is a result of a &quot;Peyton Place&quot; investigation into Anarene&#x27;s bedrooms, parked cars, football games, movie theater, restaurant, and pool hall.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;the most considered, craftsmanlike and elaborate tribute we have yet had to what the movies were and how they figured in our lives.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;an exceedingly well-made and involving narrative film with decent aims, encouraging us to understand and care about its characters, though not to emulate them.&quot;

, review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes displays an approval rating of 98% based on 114 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Making excellent use of its period and setting, Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s small town coming-of-age story is a sad but moving classic filled with impressive performances.&quot; According to Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 93 out of 100 based on 15 critics, the film received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The film and its poster are refenced in the title of the 1975 album &quot;The Last Record Album&quot; by American rock band Little Feat and in the cover illustration by Neon Park.

===Awards and nominations===
It ranked No. 19 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of the 50 Best High School Movies. In 2007, the film was ranked No. 95 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 10th Anniversary Edition of the 100 greatest American films of all time.

In April 2011, &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; was re-released in UK and Irish cinemas, distributed by Park Circus. &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine gave the film a five-star review, stating: &quot;Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s desolate Texan drama is still as stunning now as it was in 1971.&quot;

===Home media===
The film was released by The Criterion Collection in November 2010 as part of its box set &quot;America Lost and Found: The BBS Story&quot;. It included a high-definition digital transfer of Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut, two audio commentaries, one from 1991, featuring Bogdanovich and actors Cybill Shepherd, Randy Quaid, Cloris Leachman, and Frank Marshall; the other from 2009, featuring Bogdanovich &quot;&quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;: A Look Back&quot;, (1999) and &quot;Picture This&quot; (1990), documentaries about the making of the film, &quot;A Discussion with Filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich&quot;, a 2009 Q&amp;A, screen tests and location footage, and excerpts from a 1972 television interview with director François Truffaut about the New Hollywood.

==Director&#x27;s cut==
Bogdanovich re-edited the film in 1992 to create a &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot;. This version restores seven minutes of footage that Bogdanovich trimmed from the 1971 release because Columbia had imposed a firm 119-minute limit. With this requirement removed in the 1990s, Bogdanovich used the 127-minute cut on LaserDisc, VHS and DVD releases. The original 1971 cut was never released on DVD or Blu-ray for years, though it was released on VHS and LaserDisc through Columbia Tristar Home Video. However, the theatrical cut, along with the more known director&#x27;s cut, was included as a part of Sony&#x27;s Columbia Classics Volume 3 4K Blu-ray box set.

There are two substantial scenes restored in the director&#x27;s cut. The first is a sex scene between Jacy and Abilene that plays in the poolhall after it has closed for the night; it precedes the exterior scene where he drops her off home and she says &quot;What a night. I never thought &quot;this&quot; would happen.&quot; The other major insertion is a scene that plays in Sam&#x27;s café, where Genevieve watches while an amiable Sonny and a revved-up Duane decide to take their road trip to Mexico; it precedes the exterior scene outside the pool hall when they tell Sam of their plans, the last time they will ever see him.

Several shorter scenes were also restored. One comes between basketball practice in the gym and the exterior at The Rig-Wam drive-in; it has Jacy, Duane and Sonny riding along in her convertible (and being chased by an enthusiastic little dog), singing an uptempo rendition of the more solemn school song sung later at the football game. Another finds Sonny cruising the town streets in the pick-up, gazing longingly into Sam&#x27;s poolhall, café and theater, from which he has been banished. Finally, there is an exterior scene of the auto caravan on its way to the Senior Picnic; as it passes the fishing tank where he had fished with Sam and Billy, Sonny sheds a tear for his departed friend and his lost youth.

Two scenes got slightly longer treatments: Ruth&#x27;s and Sonny&#x27;s return from the doctor, and the boys&#x27; returning Billy to Sam after his encounter with Jemmie Sue—both had added dialogue. Also, a number of individual shots were put back in, most notably a Gregg Toland-style deep focus shot in front of the Royal Theatre as everyone gets in their cars.

==Sequel==
&quot;Texasville&quot;, the 1990 sequel to &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, based on McMurtry&#x27;s 1987 novel of the same name, was also directed by Bogdanovich, from his own screenplay, without McMurtry this time. The film reunites actors Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd, Timothy Bottoms, Cloris Leachman, Eileen Brennan, Randy Quaid, Sharon Ullrick (née Taggart) and Barc Doyle.

<text>Laura is a 1944 American film noir produced and directed by Otto Preminger. It stars Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, along with Clifton Webb, Vincent Price, and Judith Anderson. The screenplay by Jay Dratler, Samuel Hoffenstein, and Betty Reinhardt is based on the 1943 novel &quot;Laura&quot; by Vera Caspary. &quot;Laura&quot; received five nominations for the Academy Awards, including for Best Director, winning for Best Black and White Cinematography. In 1999, &quot;Laura&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The American Film Institute named it one of the 10 best mystery films of all time, and it also appears on Roger Ebert&#x27;s &quot;Great Movies&quot; series.

==Plot==
New York City Police Department Detective Mark McPherson is investigating the murder of a young, beautiful, highly successful advertising executive, Laura Hunt, killed by a shotgun blast to the face just inside the doorway of her apartment. He first interviews charismatic newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, an imperious, effete older man who relates how he met Laura and became her mentor. She had become his platonic friend and steady companion, and, wishing more, he used his considerable fame, influence, and connections to advance her career.

Mark also questions Laura&#x27;s parasitic playboy fiancé, Shelby Carpenter, a &quot;kept man&quot; tethered to her wealthy socialite aunt, Ann Treadwell. Ann tolerates Shelby&#x27;s infatuation with Laura, apparently out of her practical acceptance of Shelby&#x27;s need for the affection of a woman closer to his age. Bessie Clary, Laura&#x27;s loyal and highly distraught housekeeper, is also questioned by Mark. Through the testimony of Laura&#x27;s friends and reading her letters and diary, Mark becomes obsessed with her − so much so that Waldo finally accuses him of falling in love with the dead woman. He also learns that Waldo was jealous of Laura&#x27;s suitors, using his newspaper column and influence to keep them at bay.

One night, the detective falls asleep in Laura&#x27;s apartment in front of her portrait. He is awakened by a woman entering with her own key and is shocked to discover that it is Laura. She finds a dress in her closet that belonged to one of her models, Diane Redfern. Mark concludes that the body assumed to have been Laura was Diane, drawn there for a liaison by Shelby while Laura was away at her country residence. With Laura still alive, unmasking the killer becomes even more urgent. By tapping Laura&#x27;s phone, Mark follows her to a meeting with Shelby after which Shelby drives to her country residence to retrieve a shotgun. When confronted, Shelby insists that he did not come forward with the information that Laura was alive simply because he was panic-stricken. He explains the shotgun by saying he planned to give it to Laura for protection. Mark tests it against the ballistics from Diane&#x27;s body and finds that it is not a match.

At a party celebrating Laura&#x27;s return, Mark arrests Laura for the murder of Diane. Upon questioning her, he becomes convinced that she is innocent and that she does not love Shelby. He searches Waldo&#x27;s apartment, where he becomes suspicious of a clock identical to the one in Laura&#x27;s apartment. On closer examination, he finds it has a secret compartment. Mark returns to Laura&#x27;s apartment. Waldo is there and notices a growing bond between Laura and the detective. Waldo insults Mark and is sent away by Laura but pauses on the stairwell outside. Mark examines Laura&#x27;s clock and finds the shotgun that killed Diane but leaves it there. Laura is confronted with the truth that Waldo is the murderer.

Mark and Laura kiss, and then he locks her into her apartment, warning her to admit no one. After he leaves, Waldo, who had slipped in by the kitchen entrance, retrieves the shotgun and attempts to kill Laura, saying that if he cannot have her, no one can. She deflects his shot and flees just as Mark arrives. Mark&#x27;s sergeant shoots down Waldo. As he dies, Waldo whispers, &quot;Goodbye, Laura. Goodbye, my love.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
Otto Preminger was looking for a theatrical project to direct and first became aware of Vera Caspary&#x27;s story when her agent offered him the first draft of a play called &quot;Ring Twice for Laura.&quot; Preminger liked the high-society setting and the unusual plot twist, but he felt the work needed a major revision and offered to rewrite it with its author. Caspary and he disagreed about the direction they should take it, and she opted to collaborate with writer George Sklar, instead. Marlene Dietrich expressed interest in portraying the title character, but without the attachment of Dietrich or another major star, Caspary was unable to find a producer willing to finance a national tour or a Broadway run and abandoned the project.

Caspary eventually adapted the play for both a novel with the same title and a sequel, which she titled simply &quot;Laura&quot;. They were both purchased by 20th Century Fox for $30,000. Fox announced George Sanders and Laird Cregar as the leads.

Interim studio head William Goetz, serving in that capacity while Darryl F. Zanuck was fulfilling his military duty, assigned Preminger the task of developing the books for the screen. Preminger began working with Jay Dratler, Samuel Hoffenstein, and Betty Reinhardt. Recalling the differences of opinion Caspary and he had, Preminger opted not to involve her until the first draft was completed. He sensed the more interesting character was not Laura, but Waldo Lydecker, and expanded his role accordingly. Caspary was unhappy with the plot changes, though.

Zanuck, with whom Preminger previously had clashed, returned to the studio and was angered to discover Goetz had rehired his nemesis. In retaliation, he announced that Preminger could produce &quot;Laura&quot; but not direct it and assigned him to helm &quot;In the Meantime, Darling&quot; instead. Several directors, including Lewis Milestone, were offered and rejected &quot;Laura&quot; until Rouben Mamoulian finally agreed to direct.

Mamoulian immediately ignored all of Preminger&#x27;s directives as producer and began to rewrite the script. To Preminger&#x27;s dismay, he cast Laird Cregar, known for his portrayal of Jack the Ripper in &quot;The Lodger&quot;, in the key role of Lydecker. The producer felt casting an actor with a reputation for playing sinister roles would lead the audience to become suspicious of Lydecker earlier than necessary. He favored Clifton Webb, a noted Broadway actor, who had not appeared before the cameras since 1930, and who at that time was performing in the Noël Coward play &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; in Los Angeles.

Fox casting director Rufus LeMaire and Zanuck both objected to Webb because of his effeminate mannerisms, which were exactly what Preminger felt suited the character. Preminger filmed the actor delivering a monologue from the Coward play, and Zanuck agreed that Webb was perfect for the role. Zanuck was similarly campaigning for actor Reginald Gardiner to play the role of Shelby, though Fox contractee Vincent Price finally got the role.

Filming began on April 27, 1944, and from the start, Mamoulian had problems with his cast. He offered relative newcomers Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews little support, allowed theatrically trained Judith Anderson to play to the balcony instead of reining in her performance, and virtually ignored Webb, who had learned that the director was unhappy with his casting.

After viewing the early rushes, Zanuck called a meeting with Mamoulian and Preminger, each of whom blamed the other for the problems on the set. Preminger finally convinced Zanuck that the material needed a more subtle approach than Mamoulian was willing to give it, and the defeated studio head, in frustration, reluctantly allowed Preminger to dismiss Mamoulian and direct the film himself. Preminger immediately hired a new cinematographer and scenic designer and replaced the portrait of Laura – a crucial element of the film; Mamoulian&#x27;s wife Azadia had painted the original portrait, but Preminger replaced that with an enlarged photograph (taken by Fox photographer Frank Polony) of Tierney, lightly dabbed with oils to give it the ethereal effect he wanted.

Preminger initially experienced resistance from his cast, who had been led to believe Preminger was unhappy with their work by the departing Mamoulian. &quot;Once we got used to Otto, we had a pretty easy time&quot;, Vincent Price recalled in a July 1989 interview. Filming was completed on June 29, slightly over budget, but within the projected timetable.

Zanuck was unhappy with Preminger&#x27;s first cut of the film and insisted it be given a new ending, in which it was revealed Lydecker had imagined the entire story, but following a screening of the Zanuck version, columnist Walter Winchell approached the studio head and told him, &quot;I didn&#x27;t get [the ending]. You&#x27;ve got to change it.&quot; Having lost again, Zanuck relented and allowed Preminger to reinstate his original finale, telling him, &quot;This is your success. I concede.&quot;

===Music===
Once the principal photography had been completed, Preminger hired David Raksin to score the film. The director wanted to use &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot; by Duke Ellington for the main theme, but Raksin objected to the choice. Alfred Newman, music director for Fox, convinced Preminger to give Raksin a weekend to compose an original tune. Furious, Preminger gave Raksin that weekend, but threatened him with dismissal in case he failed.

Inspired by a &quot;Dear John&quot; letter he received from his wife over the course of that weekend, Raksin composed the haunting theme, also titled &quot;Laura&quot;, for which Johnny Mercer later wrote lyrics. It eventually became a jazz standard recorded by more than 400 artists, including Stan Kenton, Dick Haymes, Woody Herman, Nat King Cole, The Four Freshmen, Charlie Parker, Billy Eckstine, and Frank Sinatra. Spike Jones did a parody version of the song. Preminger was so pleased with Raksin&#x27;s score that he not only did not dismiss Raksin, but also collaborated with him on four additional films.

===Soundtrack===
In 1993, Fox Records released a 27-minute suite of Raksin&#x27;s score on an album paired with Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score for &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; In 2013, Kritzerland released the complete Raksin score, along with test demos and the suite from the original album as bonus tracks.

== Home media==
Magnetic Video released the film on home video however, by 1992, the film had not been available on home video for almost a decade although was available on LaserDisc.

20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on Region 1 DVD on March 15, 2005. It is in fullscreen format with audio tracks and subtitles in English and Spanish. Bonus tracks include commentaries by film historian Jeanine Basinger, composer David Raksin, and author Rudy Behlmer; a deleted scene; the original theatrical trailer; and &quot;Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait&quot; and &quot;Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain&quot;, two episodes from &quot;A&amp;E Biography&quot;. In a deleted scene (1:06) with benefactor Webb, &quot;... the beautiful Tierney was placed in a more feminine role model, and in the end it was decided to delete her for the cinema release of the film&quot;. The scene was restored on January 14, 2019, and presented as an &quot;extended version&quot; on DVD releases. The film became available on Blu-ray on February 5, 2012. Eureka Entertainment released the movie on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on January 14, 2019. Four of the five radio adaptations were included as extras on the disc (with the 1950 episode of The Screen Guild Theater omitted).

==Adaptations==

===Radio===
&quot;Laura&quot; was adapted as a radio play for two different episodes of &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;, the first starring Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews, and Vincent Price (February 5, 1945), and the second starring Gene Tierney and Victor Mature (February 1, 1954). It was also adapted for the May 30, 1948, broadcast of &quot;Ford Theatre&quot; with Virginia Gilmore and John Larkin. In addition, &quot;Laura&quot; was presented twice on &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; (August 20, 1945, and February 23, 1950), both episodes starring Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews, and Clifton Webb.

===Television===
In 1955, the movie was remade as a presentation of the drama anthology series &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot;, starring Dana Wynter in the title role. Robert Stack played McPherson and George Sanders played Lydecker. The director was John Brahm and the script was written by Mel Dinelli.

&quot;Laura&quot; was also adapted for a television production produced by David Susskind, aired on January 24, 1968, starring Lee Radziwiłł in Gene Tierney&#x27;s part. Sanders returned in Clifton Webb&#x27;s role, and Stack in Dana Andrews&#x27;s. The show was taped in London and the teleplay was written by Truman Capote. It met with unanimous negative reactions, which was attributed to Radziwiłł&#x27;s poor acting.

David Lynch&#x27;s mystery series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; borrows general plot elements and character names from &quot;Laura&quot;. Laura Palmer is a murder victim being investigated by a detective who reads her diary and develops feelings for her.

An episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; titled &quot;Aquiel&quot; was likewise inspired by &quot;Laura&quot;. In one early draft of the murder mystery episode, the writers struggled with the fact that their initial solution for the mystery seemed too close to the plot of &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;. Producer Michael Piller suggested they instead look to &quot;Laura&quot; as a blueprint. The script was adjusted accordingly, featuring a character in a detective role falling in love with a supposed murder victim through her personal logs, only to discover that she was, in fact, alive.

<text>The Learning Tree is a 1969 American coming-of-age film written, produced and directed by Gordon Parks, who also scored the film. It depicts the life of Newt Winger, a teenager growing up in Cherokee Flats, Kansas, in the 1920s and chronicles his journey into manhood marked with tragic events. Based on Parks&#x27; 1963 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, &quot;The Learning Tree&quot; was the first film directed by a black filmmaker for a major American film studio, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts.

In 1989, &quot;The Learning Tree&quot; was among the first group of 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1920s Kansas, a group of African-American boys, Newt Winger, Marcus Savage, and friends steal apples from Jake Kiner&#x27;s orchard, and when Jake (who is white) confronts the boys, he is beaten and left for dead by Marcus, who later is sent to jail for his actions. While chasing after Marcus and the boys, the racist white sheriff shoots dead an innocent black boy crossing a river, and the sheriff is not punished.

Newt, despite escapades like ending up in a barn during a tornado with a large local girl who takes off her clothes, does well in school and aims to go to college; a white teacher tries to dissuade him, but the white principal opposes the racism of the town and encourages his ambitions.

While Marcus is in jail, Newt begins to work for Jake to make up for his actions and those of his friends and begins a relationship with Arcella Jefferson, a new girl in town, but his relationship with her is destroyed when Chauncey Cavanaugh, a white boy and son of the local judge, impregnates Arcella (implied to be through rape), who ultimately moves away out of shame. (The judge later apologizes to Newt and his family and says things will be taken care of) After Marcus leaves jail, he works as a janitor at a brothel. Another scene depicts Newt&#x27;s winning a boxing match at the county fair, in which he beats Marcus.

One day when Newt had just woken up from a nap in the loft of Jake&#x27;s barn, he witnesses the brutal attack and murder of Jake by Booker Savage, Marcus&#x27; father, who was stealing liquor. Newt initially keeps quiet about what he has seen, but is bothered that Silas Newhall, a white man and disgruntled employee of Jake, who was at the scene of the crime for another reason, is being accused of a murder he did not commit. Encouraged by his mother Sarah (who dies from the stress of all the goings-on), Newt reveals to Judge Cavanaugh that Booker committed the murder, and he testifies in court. Newt&#x27;s testimony leads to the suicide of Booker, who seized a gun at the courthouse. Later, Newt is nearly killed by Marcus, who is then shot in the back by the sheriff while running away, and dies in the same river that Newt&#x27;s and Marcus&#x27; friend was shot in. Newt refuses a lift home from the sheriff, and he walks away to an uncertain future.

==Background==
The film &quot;The Learning Tree&quot; is based on Gordon Parks&#x27;s 1963 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. Parks also wrote the screenplay, and as a result, the script for the film did not deviate much from the book, except for featuring fewer characters for the sake of running time. In addition to being the screenwriter, he was the director, producer, and music composer. Burnett Guffey served as cinematographer, and Parks was assisted by Jack Aldworth and Fred Giles. Parks tried to include as many black technicians as possible on the film.

Parks personally chose Kyle Johnson to play the character of Newt after a brief meeting with him in a Beverly Hills hotel. However, during the meeting, he gave no indication that he wanted to cast Johnson. Johnson kept getting called for screen tests, and after the fourth test, he learned that he had been hired and that the tests were meant to gauge the abilities of the other actors, not him. Johnson characterized the audition process as &quot;not normal&quot;.

According to Turner Classic Movies, the original name of the film was &quot;Learn, Baby, Learn&quot;, then it was changed to its current name. The current title appears to be taken from a line in the film, one that Sarah Winger tells her son Newt: &quot;Let Cherokee Flats be your learning tree.&quot;

== Film production ==
&quot;The Learning Tree&quot; was bought by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in 1969 and became the first film directed by a black person for a major American film studio. Parks later said:

&quot;The Learning Tree&quot; was shot on location in Fort Scott, Kansas, in the fall of 1968, and the production process was scheduled to take three months. Fort Scott had been where Parks grew up, and it was also the basis for the fictional town of Cherokee Flats.
Kyle Johnson remembers that when production began there was a circus in town. As a result, the circus scene in the film features an actual circus rather than a staged one. Moreover, the circus scene included citizens of Fort Scott, who were there for the circus in town anyway.

Additionally, Johnson recalls that his “most enjoyable work as an actor” was done under Gordon Parks. Specifically, Johnson says “I really enjoyed &quot;The Learning Tree;&quot; for me it was like being part of a tight-run ship, a well-oiled machine. You do your part, and you recognize its importance and relationship to all the other parts, cast, crew, director and so forth.”

Parks is said to have followed his instincts while filming and encouraged the actors to follow their own instincts while acting. This ease while filming arguably contributed to the fact that scenes were shot in very few takes.

During the film production, executives from Warner Bros. often visited the set. Warner sent representatives over to check on Parks and make sure that production was running smoothly, allegedly because Parks was an African-American director.

The US Information Agency produced a film called &quot;My Father: Gordon Parks&quot; (1969) that film presents a behind-the-scenes look at the production of a feature film based on &quot;The Learning Tree,&quot; produced by Allegro Films and directed by Meyer Odze.

== Exodusters ==
In 1879, many African Americans migrated to Kansas, and they became known as the &quot;Exodusters&quot;. Among those who traveled were the ancestors of Gordon Parks. His father, Andrew Jackson Parks, was a tenant farmer in Kansas. Given that Gordon Parks was born in Fort Scott, Kansas, in 1912, he was the &quot;issue of the second generation of exodusters&quot;. His ancestral background played a role in choosing Fort Scott as the filming location for &quot;The Learning Tree&quot;.

The Exodusters earned their name after nearly 6,000 black Americans migrated to Kansas after the Emancipation. Their exodus was prompted by the 1879 Windom Resolution that encouraged African Americans to leave the southern states where they were still met with much hatred, even though the American Civil War had ended a little more than a decade earlier. Kansas promised a fresh start for the Exodusters, who wanted to begin a new life, in a new land, away from the southerners who had once enslaved them.

== Depictions of black manhood ==
&quot;The Learning Tree&quot; juxtaposes the lives of Newt Winger and Marcus Savage, two former friends that are trying to find themselves in a white-dominated Midwestern society. Although these two young men have different personalities and different goals in life, both characters represent two examples of black manhood.

Newt is a young man who tries to adhere to morals, but he is upset by the racial injustice of the day. When adversity occurs, he tries to act with dignity: when he and his friends steal from Jake Kiner, he attempts to make amends by working for him pro bono; when Chauncey Cavanaugh takes a liking to Newt&#x27;s girlfriend Arcella, he does his best to protect her and ultimately he comes to term with his loss without showing aggression; he tells the truth in the Kiner murder trial despite that it exposes Booker Savage as the killer and shows some African Americans in an unfavorable light. Newt&#x27;s determination to act ethically is a reflection of his moral character.

In contrast, Marcus is a young man who also is upset by the racial injustice of the day, but retaliates with violence. His rocky relationship with his father does not help his psyche and predisposes him to violence. In the case of Marcus, he begins to embody violence, specifically when he beats Kiner and attempts to murder Newt for sending both him and his father to jail.

== Soundtrack ==
Gordon Parks composed and wrote the following score for &quot;The Learning Tree&quot;:
# &quot;The Learning Tree – Main Title&quot;, sung by O.C. Smith 
# &quot;The Storm To Calm&quot;
# &quot;Bluebird&quot;
# &quot;The Swimming Hole&quot;
# &quot;Concerto&quot; (Arcella&#x27;s Theme)
# &quot;Birthday Present&quot;
# &quot;Chorale&quot; (The Learning Tree)
# &quot;Poor Tuck&quot;
# &quot;Questions &amp; Answers&quot;
# &quot;My Baby&#x27;s Gone&quot; (feat. Jimmy Rushing)
# &quot;The Fight&quot;
# &quot;Confrontation&quot; (feat. Kyle Johnson &amp; Joel Fluellen)
# &quot;Hymn – End Title&quot;
&quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Roger Greenspun praised the film&#x27;s score in his review, saying that the music &quot;telegraphs and then drains each crisis&quot;.

== Reception ==
When &quot;The Learning Tree&quot; premiered at the Trans-Lux East and West in New York City on August 6, 1969, it was well received by critics. Roger Greenspun wrote in his review that the scenes in the film took on a &quot;kind of ceremonial vitality and lifelikeness&quot;. Parks&#x27; and Guffey&#x27;s strong attention to detail helped to make this film beloved and well-remembered to the American public.

It grossed $33,000 in its opening week and reached number one at the US box office in its seventh week of release.

&quot;The Learning Tree&quot; was among the first group of 25 films to be listed on National Film Registry when the registry was created in 1989.

<doc id="74877" wikidata="Q10559776" url="?curid=74877" title="Let's All Go to the Lobby">
<text>Let&#x27;s All Go to the Lobby (officially known as Technicolor Refreshment Trailer No. 1) is an American animated musical advertisement that was produced in the mid-1950s for Filmack Studios. It was played in theaters before the beginning of the main film or before intermission, and features animated food items urging the audience to buy snacks sold in the theater lobby. It was directed by Dave Fleischer with lyrics by Jack Tillar.

Filmack has continued selling copies of &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go to the Lobby&quot; in the decades since its production and estimates that 80% of independent domestic theaters have screened the advertisement. The film historian Daniel Eagan wrote that it is likely the most-viewed snipe and that it was ubiquitous to the American theater-going experience of the 1960s. The well-known scene of the animated concessions has frequently been parodied in popular culture. In 2000, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go to the Lobby&quot; was selected for preservation in the US National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Content ==
&quot;Let&#x27;s All Go to the Lobby&quot; consists of six shots. The most recognizable of these depicts four animated food items (from left to right: a candy bar, popcorn, candy, and a soft drink) singing and walking leftwards. In the foreground before these characters are silhouettes of audience members, creating an illusion of depth, a standard technique of the medium. In a later shot, a group of four consumers are depicted enjoying their purchased food items.

The eponymous song of the film is set to the same tune as &quot;We Won&#x27;t Be Home Until Morning&quot;, &quot;The Bear Went Over the Mountain&quot;, &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot;, and &quot;Marlbrough s&#x27;en va-t-en guerre&quot; (). While the origins of the melody are lost, it was already well-enough known in the early 19th century to be used for a passage in &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot; (1813) by Ludwig van Beethoven.

The film historian Daniel Eagan wrote that &quot;[w]ith its simple, repetitive lyrics and streamlined animation, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go to the Lobby&quot; has a hypnotic pull that is as compelling today as it was fifty years ago.&quot; He also wrote that by choosing not to simply photograph the offered items, the creators of the advertisement avoided using brand names of the products for sale.

==Background and production==
The Chicago-based Filmack Studios, originally known as Filmack Trailer Company, was founded in 1919 by Irving Mack. The company specialized in the production of snipes, an industry term for filmed newsreels, promotional material, advertisements, previews of coming attractions, courtesy requests for the audience, and notices concerning the concession stand of the movie theater. In 1951, the sales of concession stands represented approximately 20% of movie theaters&#x27; revenue. Filmack commissioned a series of Technicolor trailers aimed at informing audiences about a theater&#x27;s newly installed concession stand. &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go to the Lobby&quot; was one of these films.

The lyrics of the song featured in &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go to the Lobby&quot; were written by Jack Tillar. Dave Fleischer is identified as the creator of the advertisement in a catalog of Filmack&#x27;s releases, which reported that &quot;trailers were produced exclusively for Filmack by Dave Fleischer&quot;. Specific details of Fleischer&#x27;s involvement are lacking, and the original production records are considered lost; other production crew are unknown. Production may have started by 1953, but Robbie Mack (a later owner of Filmack) estimates that it was completed . The release date is typically estimated to be 1957. Filmack still owns the rights to the advertisement and licenses its use by various theater owners.

==Legacy==
Filmack has continued selling copies of &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go to the Lobby&quot; in the decades since its production. The company estimates that 80% of independent theaters in the United States have screened the film, and Eagan has said that it is likely the most-viewed snipe. In 2000, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go to the Lobby&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the US Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The animation historian Thad Komorowski has stated that while the animation was &quot;downright primitive&quot; by the standards of the 1950s, it &quot;outlast[ed] any other trailer of its kind&quot;. John Owens of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;one of the most iconic movies in American cinema history&quot;. Eagan, who wrote a comprehensive guide to National Film Registry titles, called it &quot;a cultural touchstone&quot; and an inherent part of the American theater experience of the 1950s and 1960s.

=== In popular culture ===

&quot;Let&#x27;s All Go to the Lobby&quot;″s scene of singing concessions has been frequently parodied in advertisements of the 2000s. These include a 2006 spot for Chipotle Mexican Grill where a burrito attempts to join the characters, a 2011 spot for the Tribeca Film Festival where the characters are mobsters voiced by the cast of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, and a 2013 GEICO commercial where the characters are chided for speaking on their cell phones. It has also been spoofed in popular entertainment including the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot;, and &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot;, and appears in fictional depictions of theaters. Lionsgate produced a quarantine-themed version of the snipe to accompany special presentations of films streamed online during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>The Northeast Caucasian languages, also called East Caucasian, Nakh-Daghestani or Vainakh-Daghestani, or sometimes Caspian languages (from the Caspian Sea, in contrast to &quot;Pontic languages&quot; for the Northwest Caucasian languages), is a family of languages spoken in the Russian republics of Dagestan, Chechnya and Ingushetia and in Northern Azerbaijan as well as in Georgia and diaspora populations in Western Europe and the Middle East. According to Glottolog, there are currently 36 Nakh-Dagestanian languages.

==Name of the family==
Several names have been in use for this family. The most common term, &quot;Northeast Caucasian&quot;, contrasts the three established families of the Caucasian languages: &quot;Northeast Caucasian&quot;, &quot;Northwest Caucasian&quot; (Abkhaz–Adyghean) and &quot;South Caucasian&quot; (Kartvelian). This may be shortened to &quot;East Caucasian&quot;. The term &quot;Nakh(o)-Dagestanian&quot; can be taken to reflect a primary division of the family into Nakh and Dagestanian branches, a view which is no longer widely accepted, or &quot;Dagestanian&quot; can subsume the entire family. The rare term &quot;North Caspian&quot; (as in bordering the Caspian Sea) is only used in opposition to the use of &quot;North Pontic&quot; (as in bordering the Black Sea) for the Northwest Caucasian languages.

==Linguistic features==
===Phonology===
Historically, Northeast Caucasian phonemic inventories were thought to be smaller than those of the neighboring Northwest Caucasian family. However, more recent research has revealed that many Northeast Caucasian languages are much more phoneme-rich than previously believed, with some languages containing as many as 70 consonants.

In addition to numerous front obstruents, many Northeast Caucasian languages also possess a number of back consonants, including uvulars, pharyngeals, and glottal stops and fricatives. Northeast Caucasian phonology is also notable for its use of numerous secondary articulations as contrastive features. Whereas English consonant classes are divided into voiced and voiceless phonemes, Northeast Caucasian languages are known to contrast voiced, voiceless, ejective and tense phones, which contributes to their large phonemic inventories. Some languages also include palatalization and labialization as contrastive features. Most languages in this family contrast tense and weak consonants. Tense consonants are characterized by the intensiveness of articulation, which naturally leads to a lengthening of these consonants.

In contrast to the generally large consonant inventories of Northeast Caucasian languages, most languages in the family have relatively few vowels, although more on average than the Northwest Caucasian languages. However, there are some exceptions to this trend, such as Chechen, which has at least twenty-eight vowels, diphthongs and triphthongs.

===Morphology===
These languages can be characterized by strong suffixal agglutination. Weak tendencies towards inflection may be noted as well. Nouns display covert nominal classification, but partially overt cases of secondary origin can be observed too. The number of noun classes in individual languages range from two to eight. Regarding grammatical number, there may be a distinction between singular and plural, plurality itself may impact the class to which a noun belongs. In some cases, a grammatical collective is seen. Many languages distinguish &quot;local&quot; versus &quot;functional&quot; cases, and to some degree also &quot;casus rectus&quot; versus &quot;casus obliquus&quot;.

The inflectional paradigms are often based on partially classifying productive stem extensions (absolutive and oblique, ergative and genitive inflection.) Localization is mostly conveyed by postpositions, but it can be also partly based on preverbs. Noun phrases exhibit incomplete class agreement, group inflection (on the noun) with partial attributive oblique marking, which may, in turn, carry a partially determining function.

Verbs do not agree with person, with a few exceptions like Lak, in which first and second persons are marked with the same suffix and verbs agree with the P argument, and Hunzib in which verbs agree with A argument. Evidentiality is prominent, with reported, sensory and epistemic moods all appearing as a way of conveying the evidence. Epistemic modality is often tied to the tense.

====Ergativity====

Most Northeast Caucasian languages exhibit an ergative–absolutive morphology. This means that objects of transitive sentences and subjects of intransitive sentences both fall into a single grammatical case known as the absolutive. Subjects of transitive sentences, however, carry a different marking to indicate that they belong to a separate case, known as the ergative. This distinction can be seen in the following two Archi sentences. Objects and subjects of intransitive sentences carry no suffix, which is represented by the null suffix, -. Meanwhile, agents of transitive sentences take the ergative suffix, -mu.

====Noun classes====
Northeast Caucasian languages have between two and eight noun classes. In these languages, nouns are grouped into grammatical categories depending on certain semantic qualities, such as animacy and gender. Each noun class has a corresponding agreement prefix, which can attach to verbs or adjectives of that noun. Prefixes may also have plural forms, used in agreement with a plural noun. The following table shows the noun–adjective agreement paradigm in the Tsez language.

In many Northeast Caucasian languages, as well as appearing on adjectives and verbs, agreement can also be found on parts of speech which are not usually able to agree in other language families – for example on adverbs, postpositions, particles, and even case-marked nouns and pronouns. In the example from Archi below, doːʕzub ‘big’ and abu ‘made’, but also the adverb ditːabu ‘quickly’ and the personal pronouns nenabu ‘we’ and belabu ‘to us’, all agree in number and gender with the argument in the absolutive case, χʕon ‘cow’.

This kind of clausal agreement has been labelled ‘external agreement’. The same term is also used for the (cross-linguistically even rarer) phenomenon where a converb agrees with an argument which lies outside the converb&#x27;s own clause. This is seen in the following example from Northern Akhvakh, where mīʟō ‘not having gone’ has a masculine adverbial suffix (-ō), agreeing with hugu ek’wa ‘the man’.

==Language classification==
A long-time classification divided the family into Nakh and Dagestanian branches, whence the term Nakho-Dagestanian. However, attempts at reconstructing the protolanguage suggest that the Nakh languages are no more divergent from Dagestanian than the various branches of Dagestanian are from each other, although this is still not universally accepted. The following outline, based on the work of linguist Bernard Comrie and others, has been adopted by &quot;Ethnologue&quot;. An Avar–Andi–Dido branch was abandoned, but has been resurrected as the &quot;New Type&quot; languages in Schulze (2009, 2013) and Lak–Dargwa has likewise returned.

One factor complicating internal classification within the family is that the diachronic development of its respective branches is marked both by an extreme degree of diffusion and divergence followed by secondary &quot;convergence&quot;, which complicates the comparative method.

Population data is from &quot;Ethnologue&quot; 16th ed.

===Avar–Andic family===
Spoken in the Northwest Dagestan highlands and western Dagestan. Avar is the lingua franca for these and the Tsezic languages and is the only literary language.

===Khinalug (Xinalug) isolate===

Spoken in Quba region of Azerbaijan.
* Khinalug (Xinalug) (1,000 speakers)

===Lak isolate===

Spoken in the Central Dagestan highlands. Lak is a literary language.
* Lak (152,000 speakers)
Lak is spoken in two rayons of Dagestan: Kumux and Kuli (Vači).

===Lezgic family===

Spoken in the Southeast Dagestan highlands and in Northern Azerbaijan. The Lezgian language or, as the Lezgian people themselves call it, Лезги чlал (&quot;lezgi ch&#x27;al&quot;), is the biggest in terms of the number of native speakers of all the languages of the Lezgic group (other languages from this group include Tabasaran, Udi, Tsakhur and Rutul). They are spoken in the following rayons of Dagestan: Agul, Akhty, Derbent (Kvevar), Kasumxur, Kurakh, Magaramkent, Rutul, Tabasaran, Usukhchay, Khiv and Quba and Zaqatala in Azerbaijan.

Tabasaran was once thought to be the language with the largest number of grammatical cases at 54, which could, depending on the analysis, instead be the Tsez language with 64.

Lezgian and Tabasaran are literary languages.
* Lezgic family
** Peripheral: Archi (970 speakers)
** Samur (or &quot;Nuclear Lezgian&quot;)
*** Eastern Samur
**** Tabasaran (128,900)

** Vainakh languages
*** Chechen (1,350,000)
*** Ingush (322,900)
===Tsezic (Didoic) family===

Spoken mostly in Southwest Dagestan. None are literary languages. Formerly classified geographically as East Tsezic (Hinukh, Bezta) and West Tsezic (Tsez, Khwarshi, Hunzib), these languages may actually form different subgroupings according to the latest research by Schulze (2009):
* Tsezic family
** Tsez–Hinukh
*** Tsez (Dido) (12,500)
*** Hinukh (Hinux, Ginukh) (5 as of 2010)
** Bezhta–Hunzib–Khwarshi
*** Bezhta (Kapucha) (6,800)
*** Hunzib (Gunzib) (1,420)
*** Khwarshi (Khvarshi) (8,500)
All figures except for Khwarshi were retrieved from Ethnologue. These languages are spoken in the Tsunta and Bezhta areas of Dagestan.

==Disputed connections to other families==
===North Caucasian family===

Some linguists such as Sergei Starostin think that the Northeast and Northwest Caucasian languages are part of a wider North Caucasian family, citing shared vocabulary and typological features as evidence. This proposed family does not include the neighboring Kartvelian languages. This hypothesis is questioned by some linguists.

===Connections to Hurrian and Urartian===

Some linguists—notably Igor M. Diakonoff and Starostin—see evidence of a genealogical connection between the Northeast Caucasian family and the extinct languages Hurrian and Urartian. Hurrian was spoken in various parts of the Fertile Crescent in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. Urartian was the language of Urartu, a powerful state that existed between 1000 BC or earlier and 585 BC in the area centered on Lake Van in current Turkey. The two languages are classified together as the Hurro-Urartian family. Diakonoff proposed the name &quot;Alarodian&quot; for the union of Hurro-Urartian and Northeast Caucasian.

Some scholars, however, doubt that the language families are related or believe that, while a connection is possible, the evidence is far from conclusive.

==Proto-language==

Below are selected Proto-Northeast Caucasian reconstructions of basic vocabulary items by Johanna Nichols, which she refers to as &quot;Proto-Nakh-Daghestanian&quot;.

===Possible connections to the origin of agriculture===
The Proto-Northeast Caucasian language had many terms for agriculture and Johanna Nichols has suggested that its speakers may have been involved in the development of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent and only later moved north to the Caucasus. Proto-NEC is reconstructed with words for concepts such as &quot;yoke&quot; (*...ƛ / *...ƛƛ’), as well as fruit trees such as &quot;apple&quot; (*hʕam(V)c / *hʕam(V)č) and &quot;pear&quot; (*qur / *qar; *qʕur ?), that suggest agriculture was well developed before the proto-language broke up.

<text>Letter from an Unknown Woman (, sometimes appearing without the definite article &quot;der&quot;) is a novella by Austrian writer Stefan Zweig. The work first appeared in the 1 January 1922 issue of the Viennese &quot;Neuen Freien Presse&quot;, before being published in book form as part of the collection &quot;Amok: Novellen einer Leidenschaft&quot; (Insel Verlag, 1922). The novella tells the story of an author who, while reading a letter written by a woman he does not remember, gets glimpses into her life story. It is generally considered to be Zweig&#x27;s most famous work of fiction.

==Plot==
A rich and well-known writer (R.), returning home to Vienna from one of many holidays, finds a long letter from an unknown woman (Fräulein). As a teenager the woman had lived with her poor widowed mother in the same building and had fallen totally in love with both the opulent cultured lifestyle of her neighbour and the handsome charming man himself. Her passion for the writer was not lessened by the flow of attractive women spending the night with him, nor when she had to leave Vienna and moved to Innsbruck when her mother remarried. At age 18 she returned to Vienna, took a job and tried to meet the writer again. He did not recognise her and, without revealing her name, she succeeded in spending three nights with him before he disappeared on a long holiday. Pregnant, she lost her job and had to give birth in a refuge for the indigent. Resolved that their child should have a good life, she spent nights with or became mistress of various rich men but would never marry because her heart belonged always to the writer. Out one night with a current lover, she saw the writer in a night club and went home with him instead. To him, she was just an agreeable companion for that night, as he again did not recognise her. In the 1918 flu pandemic, the child died and she, ill herself, wrote the letter to be posted after her death.

==English translations==
&quot;Brief einer Unbekannten&quot; has been translated into English three times: by Eden and Cedar Paul, as part of a collection entitled &quot;Passion and Pain&quot;, for Chapman and Hall in 1924; by Jill Sutcliffe, as part of a collection entitled &quot;The Royal Game and Other Stories&quot;, for Harmony Books in 1981; and by Anthea Bell for Pushkin Press. 

==Adaptations==
===Film===
&quot;Narkose&quot; (1929), the first adaptation, is a German expressionist silent film that was directed by Alfred Abel and written by Béla Balázs. Here the story of the female protagonist is told through a dream sequence while she is under anesthesia in a maternity ward. The film survives only in fragmentary form.

&quot;Only Yesterday&quot;, a 1933 American movie directed by John M. Stahl, was heavily inspired by Zweig&#x27;s story, while not giving it the credits.

Another unofficial adaptation came out in 1943, the Finnish &quot;Valkoiset ruusut&quot; (&quot;White Roses&quot;), starring Helena Kara and Tauno Palo and directed by Hannu Leminen.

In 1948, the first official film version was produced, with a screenplay adaptation by Howard Koch. Starring Joan Fontaine, Louis Jourdan, Mady Christians and Marcel Journet, it was directed by Max Ophüls. In 1992, &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 1957, a Mexican version called &quot;Feliz Año, Amor Mío&quot;, starring Marga López and Arturo de Córdova, was released.

In 1962, an Egyptian adaptation, &quot;Ressalah min emraa maghoula,&quot; was released. It was directed by Salah Abu Seif and starred Farid al-Atrash and Lobna Abdel Aziz.

In 2001, the TV film &quot;Lettre d&#x27;une inconnue&quot; by French director Jacques Deray became the last production of this artist.

In 2004, a Chinese adaptation of the novella was made. It was directed by Xu Jinglei.

In 2011, Mongolian film director Naranbaatar made a film adaptation of the novella.

===Opera===

In 1975, the mono-opera Письмо незнакомки (&quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot;) was composed by Antonio Spadavecchia (Антонио Спадавеккиа), and staged in the Soviet Union (and later in Russia) in Russian.
===Theatre===

In June 2024 a new English language play, adapted by Christopher Hampton and entitled &quot;Visit From An Unknown Woman,&quot; premiered at the Hampstead Theatre, London.

===Music===
In December 2017, Canadian/Russian composer Airat Ichmouratov composed Octet in G minor, Op. 56, which was inspired by Stefan Zweig&#x27;s novella &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot;. It was commissioned and premiered by Saguenay and Lafayette String Quartets on 13 January 2018 at Fanny Bay Hall, Fanny Bay, British Columbia, Canada. In November 2018, the composer made an arrangement of the Octet for String Orchestra; this was recorded by the Belarusian State Chamber Orchestra, with Evgeny Bushkov as conductor, and was released by Chandos Records.

<doc id="74894" wikidata="Q2512149" url="?curid=74894" title="The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter">
<text>The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter is a 1980 documentary film and the first movie made by Connie Field, about the American women who went to work during World War II to do &quot;men&#x27;s jobs.&quot; In 1996, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Summary==
The film&#x27;s title refers to &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot;, the cultural icon that represented women who worked the manufacturing plants which produced munitions and material during World War II.

==Production==
Connie Field got the idea for the film from a California Rosie the Riveter reunion, and, with grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and other charitable sources, conducted interviews with many hundreds of women who had gone into war work. Out of these she chose five representatives—three black, two white—all marvelously lively, intelligent, and articulate women who recall their experiences with a mixture of pleasant nostalgia and detached bitterness.

The reminiscences are intercut with the realities of the period—old news, films, recruiting trailers, March of Time clips, and pop songs such as &quot;Rosie the Riveter.&quot; These often serve to highlight the disparities between how women were portrayed in wartime media and the actual experiences of these five women.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter&quot; premiered at the New York Film Festival in 1980, which at that time was one of the most important film festivals in America, and went on to be screened at over 50 film festivals around the world. The film was released in movie theaters in the United States, England and Australia to rave reviews. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;warm, engaging and poignant&quot; and went on to say &quot;the film has that Studs Terkel-like ability to discover the extraordinary in seemingly ordinary people. Terrific.&quot; Of the Rosies themselves &quot;The London Times&quot; said &quot;the resilience, spirit and humour of Connie Field&#x27;s indomitable heroines sends you out elated and loving them.&quot;

The film earned fifteen international awards for Best Documentary, was named &quot;One of the Ten Best Films of the Year&quot; by a number of publications, including the Village Voice and Film Comment, and was voted &quot;Best Independent Feature of the Year&quot; in American Film Magazine. It was originally broadcast on PBS&#x27;s American Experience and numerous international TV stations such as Channel 4 in England and the South African Broadcasting Corporation. The film has been in active distribution for over 30 years.

<doc id="74902" wikidata="Q1199204" url="?curid=74902" title="Little Fugitive (1953 film)">
<text>Little Fugitive is a 1953 American independent drama film co-written and co-directed by Raymond Abrashkin (credited as Ray Ashley), Morris Engel, and Ruth Orkin, which tells the story of a child alone on Coney Island. It stars Richie Andrusco as the title character, and Richard Brewster as his older brother. The film was screened at 14th Venice International Film Festival, where it was awarded the Silver Lion, and nominated for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story, at the 26th Academy Awards.

An acknowledged influence on the French New Wave, the film is considered by modern-day critics to be a landmark film because of its naturalistic style and groundbreaking use of nonprofessional actors in lead roles. In 1997, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The film is the first and best known of Engel&#x27;s three feature films. It was followed by &quot;Lovers and Lollipops&quot; in 1956 and &quot;Weddings and Babies&quot;, which was filmed in 1957 and released in 1960. All three films were stylistically similar and were filmed with hand-held 35 mm cameras. The cameras used for &quot;Little Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Lovers and Lollipops&quot; did not record sound, so the dialogue and sound effects had to be dubbed subsequent to filming, but &quot;Weddings and Babies&quot; holds the distinction of being the first fictional feature filmed with a portable camera that allowed for synchronized sound.

==Plot==

Seven-year-old Joey Norton lives in an apartment in a lower-middle-class neighborhood of Brooklyn. During the summer, his older brother Lennie has to watch him when their widowed mother is at work, which Lennie resents somewhat. Joey loves horses and likes playing with Lennie and his friends, though they often pick on him.

On Lennie&#x27;s twelfth birthday, he gets a harmonica and some money to spend at Coney Island, where he is excited to go the next day with his friends Harry and Charlie. When he and Joey get home for lunch, however, they learn their grandmother has fallen ill and their mother is leaving for a day to care for her, which means Lennie will have to postpone his trip to Coney Island so he can stay home and babysit Joey. Frustrated, Lennie finds his friends and tells them the news, and they imagine various outlandish and macabre ways of dispatching Joey before deciding to play a prank.

Harry steals his father&#x27;s rifle, and Lennie brings Joey to an empty lot to see it. The older boys only pantomime firing, but when it is Joey&#x27;s turn, Harry puts a bullet in the chamber. Joey closes his eyes when he fires, and Lennie puts ketchup on his shirt and acts as though he has been shot. Charley and Harry tell Joey to run and hide, saying they will give him an hour&#x27;s head start before notifying the police. Joey takes the six dollars his mother left for Lennie to buy groceries and heads out.

Spooked by police officers in the street, Joey winds up on a train to Coney Island. He goes on rides, has his picture taken, plays carnival games, and buys a lot of food. By the time he happens upon the pony ride, he does not have enough money left to pay for it, leaving him crestfallen.

After making his way down to the crowded beach, Joey sees a boy collecting empty glass bottles. Although he is not sure what the boy is doing, Joey begins to help, and the boy explains that the five-cent deposit for each bottle can be redeemed at a stand under the boardwalk. The boy&#x27;s older brother does not let the boy share the money from the modest initial haul with Joey, so Joey sets out on his own to earn money for the pony ride. He alternates between collecting bottles and riding ponies until Jay, the nice man who works at the pony ride, asks who is watching Joey, which causes him to get frightened and run away.

Joey wanders aimlessly around Coney Island for the rest of the evening and, after sleeping under the boardwalk, the next morning, as well. He is at the pony ride when Jay arrives for work, and this time Jay is able to get Joey&#x27;s address under the guise of offering Joey a job. Jay looks up Joey&#x27;s phone number and lets Lennie know where Joey is, but Joey sees Jay greeting a police officer on the way back from the phone and runs off again.

When Lennie gets to the pony ride and learns Joey is gone, he begins to search for his little brother. At one point, he sees Joey from the parachute ride, only to lose him in the crowd on the beach. Eventually, a rainstorm clears the beach, and Lennie sees the lone figure of Joey collecting bottles.

The brothers head home, arriving minutes before their mother returns. Thinking they have just been sitting inside watching television since she left, she says that, the following weekend, she is going to take them to get some fresh air at Coney Island.

===Cast notes===
The lead character of Joey was played by Richie Andrusco, a nonprofessional actor who never appeared in another film, and most of the other parts were also portrayed by nonprofessionals. Director/writer/editor Ruth Orkin has a small role as the woman with a baby on the beach. Actor Jay Williams later co-wrote the &quot;Danny Dunn&quot; series of juvenile science fiction novels with director/writer/producer Raymond Abrashkin. The Coney Island photographer was played by Will Lee, who went on to play Mr. Hooper on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

==Production notes==
The film was filmed on location at Coney Island and in Brooklyn using a unique concealed strap-on camera, which made it possible for Engel to work without a tripod or a large crew and allowed him to have thousands of beach-going New Yorkers as extras without their knowing it. This innovation proved to be &quot;the heart and soul of why &quot;Little Fugitive&quot; was possible.&quot; The camera could be seen as a prototype for the Steadicam and was designed by Engel and his friend the inventor Charlie Woodruff, a fellow World War II combat photographer who Engel called a &quot;mechanical and engineering genius.&quot; Over the years, filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick and Jean-Luc Godard reportedly were eager to borrow this unique camera.

===Engel&#x27;s unique camera===
Engel was an experienced photo-journalist when he was asked in 1939 by his friend Paul Strand to shoot some motion picture film for his film &quot;Native Land&quot; using the compact 35mm Bell and Howell Eyemo holding 100 foot rolls that could film about one minute of film. But he was disappointed that Strand put this camera designed for hand-holding on a heavy metal baseplate attached to a heavy wooden tripod.

During World War II he was a still photographer but he probably was familiar with a handheld 35 mm battery-operated camera developed during the war for combat photography, the Cunningham Combat Camera. The large square camera was mounted a rifle stock, held tightly to the cameraman&#x27;s chest by handles mounted on each side, and aimed in the general direction of the action, sighted by a top-mounted viewfinder. With a two hundred foot magazine, it could run for two minutes. The other primary motion picture camera used by the military was the Bell and Howell Eyemo, a spring-run camera held to the eye with a 20-second running time.

After the war, Engel and an engineer he met in the service, Charles Woodruff, reconfigured the Cunningham camera into a much smaller camera for civilian purposes. Engel explained, &quot;Designed for me, it was a compact 35mm, hand held, shoulder cradled, [with] double registration pins and twin lens finder and optical system.&quot; It used the Cunningham 35mm 200 foot interchangeable magazines which met the camera at the film gate with the lens, motor, shutter, and viewfinder comprising the camera body. Twin lens geared together enabled the viewfinder lens and the camera to be focused together, as on Engel&#x27;s preferred still camera, the Rolleiflex. Like the Rolleiflex, the viewfinder was viewed from above. Held against the waist, rather than in front of the face, the camera was both steadier and less conspicuous than the Eyemo. &quot;With a simple shoulder belt support,&quot; Engel said, &quot;I was armed with a camera which became the heart of the esthetic and mobile approach to the film the &quot;Little Fugitive&quot;. This camera was about the same size as the Eyemo, but looked like a giant Ocarina with the camera in the wide part at the top and the smaller curved part below.

Film teacher Joel Schlemowitz says, &quot;The film’s storyline, about a young boy gone on the lam among the boardwalk, beach, and amusements of Coney Island, provided the opportunity to film in situations well matched to this unobtrusive camera&#x27;s virtues. The Rolleiflex-inspired chest-level configuration also assisted in giving the film its sense of visual rapport with the film&#x27;s child actor, placing the camera at eye level with the youngster&#x27;s view of the world.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film was greeted by critical acclaim at the time of its initial release. François Truffaut was inspired by its spontaneous production style when making &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (1959), and he said years later that &quot;Our New Wave would never have come into being if it hadn&#x27;t been for the young American Morris Engel, who showed us the way to independent production with [this] fine movie.&quot;

Modern critics have also praised the film. Dennis Schwartz called it &quot;A remarkable indy classic, made on a shoestring budget by a group of still photographers. It&#x27;s an affecting lyrical comedy-drama that fully captures the flavor of urban childhood innocence of the 1950s. [...] The dialogue was sparse, the story was unambitious, the film lacked drama, the children were very ordinary and their problem was only a minor one, nevertheless this beautifully realized film caught the world through the innocent eyes of a curious and scared child and left an impression that was hard to shake. It was uplifting to watch because the effort was so genuine.&quot;

When the film was screened in New York after Engel&#x27;s death in 2005, film critic Joshua Land wrote: &quot;&quot;Little Fugitive&quot; shines as a beautifully shot document of a bygone Brooklyn—any drama here resides in the grainy black-and-white cinematography, with its careful attention to the changes in light brought on by the inexorably advancing sun [...] Filled with &#x27;Aw, fellas!&#x27; period ambience and the mythic imagery of cowboys and horses, comics and baseball, it&#x27;s a key proto-vérité slice of urban America.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 45 reviews, with an average score of 8.4/10; the site&#x27;s &quot;critics consensus&quot; reads: &quot;A simple story well told, &quot;The Little Fugitive&quot; presents a kid&#x27;s-eye view of the city that feels refreshingly authentic.&quot;

<text>Horseshoe Falls is the largest of the three waterfalls that collectively form Niagara Falls on the Niagara River along the Canada–United States border. Approximately 90% of the Niagara River, after diversions for hydropower generation, flows over Horseshoe Falls. The remaining 10% flows over American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls. It is located between Terrapin Point on Goat Island in the US state of New York, and Table Rock in the Canadian province of Ontario. These falls are also referred to as the Canadian Falls.

==International border==
When the boundary line between the United States and Canada was determined in 1819, based on the Treaty of Ghent, the northeastern end of the Horseshoe Falls was in New York, United States, flowing around the Terrapin Rocks, which were once connected to Goat Island by a series of bridges. In 1955, the area between the rocks and Goat Island was filled in, creating Terrapin Point. In the early 1980s the United States Army Corps of Engineers filled in more land and built diversion dams and retaining walls to force the water away from Terrapin Point. Altogether, of the Horseshoe Falls was eliminated. Due to erosion, the Falls will continue to move in relation to the boundary line in the future, possibly altering territorial boundaries between the two countries.

The official national maps for both Canada and the United States indicate that a smaller portion of the Horseshoe Falls currently is located within the United States.

<doc id="74904" wikidata="Q2371841" url="?curid=74904" title="Little Miss Marker (1934 film)">
<text>Little Miss Marker (also known as The Girl in Pawn) is an American pre-Code 1934 comedy-drama film directed by Alexander Hall. It was written by William R. Lipman, Sam Hellman, and Gladys Lehman after a 1932 short story of the same name by Damon Runyon. It stars Shirley Temple, Adolphe Menjou and Dorothy Dell in a story about a young girl held as collateral by gangsters. It was Temple&#x27;s first starring role in a major motion picture and was crucial to establishing her as a major film star. It was inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1998 and has been remade several times.

==Plot==
A young girl named &quot;Marky&quot; is given by her father to a gangster-run gambling operation as a &quot;marker&quot; (collateral) for a bet. When he loses his bet and commits suicide, the gangsters are left with her on their hands. They decide to keep her temporarily and use her to help pull off one of their fixed races, naming her as the owner of the horse to be used in the race.

Marky is sent to live with bookie Sorrowful Jones. Initially upset about being forced to look after her, he eventually begins to develop a father–daughter relationship with her. His fellow gangsters become fond of her and begin to fill the roles of her extended family. Bangles, girlfriend of gang kingpin Big Steve, who has gone to Chicago to place bets on the horse, also begins to care for Marky and to fall in love with Sorrowful, whose own concern for Marky shows he has a warm heart beneath his hard-nosed persona. Encouraged by Bangles and Marky, Sorrowful gets a bigger apartment, buys Marky new clothes and himself a better cut of suit, reads her bedtime stories, and shows her how to pray.

However, being around the gang has a somewhat bad influence on Marky, and she begins to develop a cynical nature and a wide vocabulary of gambling terminology and slang. Worried that her acquired bad-girl attitude means she will not get adopted by a &quot;good family&quot;, Bangles and Sorrowful put on a party with gangsters dressed up as knights of the Round Table, to rekindle her former sweetness. She is unimpressed until they bring in the horse and parade her around on its back. Returning to New York, Big Steve frightens the horse, which throws her, and she is taken to the hospital. Big Steve goes there to pay back Sorrowful for trying to steal Bangles but is roped into giving Marky the direct blood transfusion she needs for her life-saving operation. Praying for her survival, Sorrowful destroys the drug which, administered to the horse, would have helped it win the race but killed it soon after. Informed that he has &quot;good blood&quot; and pleased to have given life for a change, Big Steve forgives Bangles and Sorrowful. They plan to marry and adopt Marky.

==Cast==
* Shirley Temple as Marthy &quot;Marky&quot; Jane
* Adolphe Menjou as Sorrowful Jones
* Dorothy Dell as Bangles Carson
* Charles Bickford as Big Steve Halloway
* Lynne Overman as Regret. The character is meant to be Mafia accountant Otto Berman, best friend of writer Damon Runyon.
* Warren Hymer as Sore Toe
* Sam Hardy as Benny the Gouge
* John Kelly as Canvas Back
* Willie Best as Dizzy Memphis
* Frank McGlynn Sr. as Doc Chesley
* John Sheehan as Sun Rise
* Frank Conroy as Dr. Ingalls

==Production==
Temple, who had previously auditioned for the role of Marky prior to entering her Fox contract and failed to win the part, was loaned out to Paramount by Fox Film thanks in large part to maneuvering by her mother Gertrude. Her mother, recognizing the potential of the role, arranged for a secret meeting and second audition with the director Alexander Hall. This second audition was successful and Shirley Temple was loaned out to Paramount for $1,000 a week. Temple and Dell struck up a close friendship while filming the movie. The scene in which Temple is refusing her food and using rude language (&quot;I don&#x27;t want no mush&quot; and &quot;I used to be a sissy&quot;) had to be redone as Dell could not contain her laughter in the first take. This would be Dell&#x27;s last completed film of her short career. Temple took Dell&#x27;s death very hard.

==Reception==
The film was considered a success at the box office. As a result, Paramount offered Fox $50,000 for Temple&#x27;s contract, but the offer was declined.

==Recognition==
In 1998, &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Remakes==
The film was remade as &quot;Sorrowful Jones&quot; (1949) with Bob Hope and Lucille Ball and again as &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot; (1980) with Walter Matthau, Julie Andrews, Tony Curtis, Bob Newhart, Brian Dennehy and Lee Grant. Another remake was &quot;40 Pounds of Trouble&quot; (1962), starring Tony Curtis as a casino manager who is left with an eight-year-old girl.

== Stage musical ==
Scott Ellis and David Thompson are working on a musical adaptation of the film to feature songs by Harold Arlen as its score.[1]

== Other references ==
The plot and title of the film are referenced by the book &quot;Little Myth Marker&quot;, part of Robert Asprin&#x27;s MythAdventures series.

<doc id="74907" wikidata="Q748924" url="?curid=74907" title="The Living Desert">
<text>The Living Desert is a 1953 American nature documentary film that shows the everyday lives of the animals of the desert of the Southwestern United States. The film was written by James Algar, Winston Hibler, Jack Moffitt (uncredited) and Ted Sears. It was directed by Algar, with Hibler as the narrator and was filmed in Tucson, Arizona. The film won the 1953 Oscar for Best Documentary.

It is featured in the 2006 DVD &quot;Walt Disney Legacy Collection Volume 2: Lands of Exploration&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;The Living Desert&quot; was the first feature-length film in Disney&#x27;s &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot; series of documentaries focusing on zoological studies; the previous films in the series, including the Oscar-winning &quot;Seal Island&quot;, were short subjects.

The documentary was filmed in Tucson, Arizona. Most of the wildlife shown in the film was donated to what would soon become the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum.

The film was inspired by 10 minutes of footage shot by N. Paul Kenworthy, a doctoral student at the University of California at Los Angeles. Kenworthy&#x27;s footage of a battle between a tarantula and a wasp intrigued Disney, who funded a feature-length production following the lives of diverse desert species. Disney was highly supportive of Kenworthy&#x27;s work and its impact on nonfiction filmmaking: &quot;This is where we can tell a real, sustained story for the first time in these nature pictures&quot;.

==Release==
Prior to the production of &quot;The Living Desert&quot;, Disney was releasing his films through RKO Radio Pictures, but due to a long-frayed relation with the studio, which had little enthusiasm for the producer&#x27;s documentary releases, Disney opted to sever his relation with RKO and create his own distribution subsidiary – Buena Vista Distribution, which he named after the street where his office was located. Some pre-existing contracts between RKO and Disney continued until the animated short &quot;In the Bag&quot; (1956).

The film had its world premiere on November 9, 1953 at the Sutton theatre in New York City. It was packaged with two shorts; the animated short &quot;Ben and Me&quot; and the live action short &quot;Stormy, the Thoroughbred&quot;.

&quot;The Living Desert&quot; received some criticism for bringing unsubtle humor to its scenes of desert life – Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Disney to task for adding jokey musical effects to several of the film&#x27;s scenes, including hoedown music for a sequence involving a scorpion mating dance. Nonetheless, the film was a commercial success: the $300,000 production earned $4,000,000 at the box office.

The film was very popular in Japan surpassing &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; as the highest-grossing film of all time with a gross of over $800,000.

==Honors==
The Academy Award that Disney earned for &quot;The Living Desert&quot; helped the producer make history as the individual with the most Oscar wins in a single year. At the 26th Academy Awards, in addition to winning the Best Documentary Feature Oscar, Disney also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for &quot;Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom&quot;, the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) for &quot;The Alaskan Eskimo&quot; and the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) for &quot;Bear Country&quot;.

In addition to its Oscar, the film also won the International Prize at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival, an award at the Berlin Film Festival and a special achievement award from the Golden Globe Awards. In 2000, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Louisiana Story is a 1948 American black-and-white drama film directed and produced by Robert J. Flaherty. Its script was written by Frances H. Flaherty and Robert J. Flaherty. Although it has historically been represented as a documentary film, the events and characters depicted are fictional. There is not enough factual or educational material in the film to warrant classifying it as docufiction. The film was commissioned by the Standard Oil Company to promote its drilling ventures in the Louisiana bayous.

==Plot==
The film deals with the adventures of a young Cajun boy and his pet raccoon, who live a somewhat idyllic existence playing in the bayous of Louisiana. A sub-plot involves his elderly father allowing an oil company to drill for oil in the inlet that runs behind their house. An inland barge is towed into the inlet from interconnecting waterways. Most, if not all, of South Louisiana swamps and inland waters without land access were and are explored using dredged channels and barge rigs. The film presents the rig crew tripping pipe (an oilfield operations term), changing a bit, and closing valves on the blow out preventers. The rig crew are not actors, they are actual roughnecks. Even though there is a moment of probable manufactured crisis when the rig drills into a trouble zone, the crew&#x27;s actions are not choreographed per se. The timeframe is pre-OSHA, however, there are serious doubts that drillers at that time allowed shoeless kids to hang out on the rig floor - ever. As the story progresses, the rig completes its operation and friendly drillers depart, leaving behind a phenomenally clean environment and a wealthy Cajun family.

Conflict and action for the plot is provided by the presence of a giant alligator in the area, which is believed to have eaten the pet raccoon and which is hunted in revenge. There is no individual or organized resistance to the incursion of the oil seekers, even after the (brief, offscreen) disaster, who are unequivocally portrayed as friendly, progressive humanitarians.

The boy, named in the film as Alexander Napoleon Ulysses Le Tour, but in the credits just identified as &quot;the boy&quot;, was played by Joseph Boudreaux. The film was photographed by Richard Leacock and edited by Helen van Dongen, who were also the associate producers. Its original release was through independent film distributor Lopert Films.

==Cast==
* Joseph Boudreaux as The Boy
* Lionel Le Blanc as His Father
* E. Bienvenu as His Mother (as Mrs. E. Bienvenu)
* Frank Hardy as The Driller
* C.P. Guedry as The Boilerman

==Production==
The film was shot on location in the Louisiana bayou country, using local residents for actors. However, none of the members of the Cajun family (boy, father and mother) were related, and the film does not deal with Cajun culture, the reality of the hard lives of the Cajun people, or with the mechanics of drilling for oil. The story is completely fictional.

In 1952, it was reissued by an exploitation film outfit with a new title, &quot;Cajun&quot;, on the bottom half of a double-bill with another film titled &quot;Watusi&quot;.

==Reception and awards==
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story in 1948. In 1949, Virgil Thomson won the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his score to the film (which is based on a famous field tape of authentic Cajun musicians and was performed by the Philadelphia Symphony). Through 2021, this has remained the only Pulitzer Prize awarded for a film score. In 1994, &quot;Louisiana Story&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The movie was also in the top 10 of the first British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; poll in 1952.

The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in this list:

<doc id="74909" wikidata="Q2207959" url="?curid=74909" title="Masque">
<text>The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music, dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Masquers who did not speak or sing were often courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully.

==Development==
The masque tradition developed from the elaborate pageants and courtly shows of ducal Burgundy in the late Middle Ages. Masques were typically a complimentary offering to the prince among his guests and might combine pastoral settings, mythological fables, and the dramatic elements of ethical debate. There would invariably be some political and social application of the allegory. Such pageants often celebrated a birth, marriage, change of ruler or a royal entry and invariably ended with a tableau of bliss and concord.

Masque imagery tended to be drawn from Classical rather than Christian sources, and the artifice was part of the Grand dance. Masque thus lent itself to Mannerist treatment in the hands of master designers like Giulio Romano or Inigo Jones.

The New Historians, in works like the essays of Bevington and Holbrook&#x27;s &quot;The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque&quot; (1998), have pointed out the political subtext of masques. At times, the political subtext was not far to seek: &quot;The Triumph of Peace&quot;, put on with a large amount of parliament-raised money by Charles I, caused great offence to the Puritans. Catherine de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s court festivals, often even more overtly political, were among the most spectacular entertainments of her day, although the &quot;intermezzi&quot; of the Medici court in Florence could rival them.

===Dumbshow===
In English theatre tradition, a dumbshow is a masque-like interlude of silent mime usually with allegorical content that refers to the occasion of a play or its theme, the most famous being the dumbshow played out in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (III.ii). Dumbshows might be a moving spectacle, like a procession, as in Thomas Kyd&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; (1580s), or they might form a pictorial tableau, as one in the Shakespeare collaboration, &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; (III.i)—a tableau that is immediately explicated at some length by the poet-narrator, Gower.

Dumbshows were a medieval element that continued to be popular in early Elizabethan drama, but by the time &quot;Pericles&quot; (c. 1607–08) or &quot;Hamlet&quot; (c. 1600–02) were staged, they were perhaps quaintly old-fashioned: &quot;What means this, my lord?&quot; is Ophelia&#x27;s reaction. In English masques, purely musical interludes might be accompanied by a dumbshow.

==Origins==
The masque has its origins in a folk tradition where masked players would unexpectedly call on a nobleman in his hall, dancing and bringing gifts on certain nights of the year, or celebrating dynastic occasions. The rustic presentation of &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot; as a wedding entertainment in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; offers a familiar example. Spectators were invited to join in the dancing. At the end, the players would take off their masks to reveal their identities.

===Court masques in England and Scotland===
In England, Tudor court masques developed from earlier &quot;guisings&quot;, where a masked allegorical figure would appear and address the assembled company—providing a theme for the occasion—with musical accompaniment. Costumes were designed by professionals, including Niccolo da Modena. Hall&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; explained the new fashion of Italian-style masque at the English court in 1512. The essential feature was the entry of disguised dancers and musicians to a banquet. They would appear in character and perform, and then dance with the guests, and then leave the venue.

According to George Cavendish, in January 1527 Henry VIII came to Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s Hampton Court, by boat &quot;in a masque with a dozen of other maskers all in garments like shepherds made of fine cloth of gold and fine crimson satin paned, and caps of the same with visors&quot;, wearing false beards, accompanied with torch bearers and drummers. Their arrival at the palace water gate was announced by cannon fire. The King&#x27;s part of the entertainment was organised by William Sandys and Henry Guildford. The masquers played a dice game called mumchance before dancing. Edward Hall described similar masques involving the king&#x27;s disguised appearance. In the play &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, by Fletcher and Shakespeare, the masque was recalled when Henry in shepherd&#x27;s disguise meets Anne Boleyn.

Masques at Elizabeth I&#x27;s court emphasized the concord and unity between Queen and Kingdom. A descriptive narrative of a processional masque is the masque of the Seven Deadly Sins in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (Book i, Canto IV). A particularly elaborate masque, performed over the course of two weeks for Queen Elizabeth, is described in the 1821 novel &quot;Kenilworth&quot;, by Sir Walter Scott. Queen Elizabeth was entertained at country houses during her progresses with performances like the Harefield Entertainment.

In Scotland, masques were performed at court, particularly at wedding celebrations, and the royal wardrobe provided costumes. Performers at a masque at Castle Campbell dressed as shepherds. Mary, Queen of Scots, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and David Rizzio took part in a masque in February 1566. Mary attended the wedding of her servant Bastian Pagez, and it was said she wore male costume for the masque, &quot;which apparel she loved often times to be in, in dancings secretly with the King her husband, and going in masks by night through the streets&quot;. James VI and Anne of Denmark wore masque costumes to dance at weddings at Alloa Tower and Tullibardine Castle.

After James and Anne became king and queen of England too, narrative elements of the masque at their court became more significant. Plots were often on classical or allegorical themes, glorifying the royal or noble sponsor. At the end, the audience would join with the actors in a final dance. Ben Jonson wrote a number of masques with stage design by Inigo Jones. Their works are usually thought of as the most significant in the form. Samuel Daniel and Sir Philip Sidney also wrote masques.

William Shakespeare included a masque-like interlude in &quot;The Tempest,&quot; understood by modern scholars to have been heavily influenced by the masques of Ben Jonson and the stagecraft of Inigo Jones. There is also a masque sequence in his &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Henry VIII&quot;. John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Comus&quot; (with music by Henry Lawes) is described as a masque, though it is generally reckoned a pastoral play.

There is a detailed, humorous, and malicious (and possibly completely fictitious) account by Sir John Harington in 1606 of a masque of Solomon and Sheba at Theobalds. Harington was not so much concerned with the masque itself as with the notoriously heavy drinking at the Court of King James I; &quot;the entertainment went forward, and most of the presenters went backward, or fell down, wine did so occupy their upper chambers&quot;. As far as we can ascertain the details of the masque, the Queen of Sheba was to bring gifts to the King, representing Solomon, and was to be followed by the spirits of Faith, Hope, Charity, Victory and Peace. Unfortunately, as Harington reported, the actress playing the Queen tripped over the steps of the throne, sending her gifts flying; Hope and Faith were too drunk to speak a word, while Peace, annoyed at finding her way to the throne blocked, made good use of her symbolic olive branches to slap anyone who was in her way.

Francis Bacon paid for &quot;The Masque of Flowers&quot; to celebrate the marriage of Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset and Frances Howard, Countess of Somerset. James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, was a performer and sponsor of court masques. He wrote about the tight-fitting costumes, that it was the fashion &quot;to appear very small in the waist, I remember was drawn up from the ground by both hands whilst the tailor with all his strength buttoned on my doublet&quot;.

Reconstructions of Stuart masques have been few and far between. Part of the problem is that only texts survive complete; there is no complete music, only fragments, so no authoritative performance can be made without interpretive invention. By the time of the English Restoration in 1660, the masque was passé, but the English semi-opera which developed in the latter part of the 17th century, a form in which John Dryden and Henry Purcell collaborated, borrows some elements from the masque and further elements from the contemporary courtly French opera of Jean-Baptiste Lully.

In the 18th century, masques were even less frequently staged. &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; started out as part of &quot;Alfred&quot;, a masque about Alfred the Great co-written by James Thomson and David Mallet with music by Thomas Arne which was first performed at Cliveden, country house of Frederick, Prince of Wales. Performed to celebrate the third birthday of Frederick&#x27;s daughter Augusta, it remains among the best-known British patriotic songs up to the present, while the masque of which it was originally part is remembered by only specialist historians.

==Legacy==
The most outstanding humanists, poets and artists of the day, in the full intensity of their creative powers, devoted themselves to producing masques; and until the Puritans closed the English theatres in 1642, the masque was the highest art form in England. But because of its ephemeral nature, not a lot of documentation related to masques remains, and much of what is said about the production and enjoyment of masques is still part speculation.

==17th- and 18th-century masques==
While the masque was no longer as popular as it was at its height in the 17th century, there are many later examples of the masque. During the late 17th century, English semi-operas by composers such as Henry Purcell had masque scenes inset between the acts of the play proper. In the 18th century, William Boyce and Thomas Arne, continued to utilize the masque genre mostly as an occasional piece, and the genre became increasingly associated with patriotic topics. Acis and Galatea (Handel) is another successful example. There are isolated examples throughout the first half of the 19th century.

==Later masques==
With the renaissance of English musical composition during the late 19th and early 20th century (the so-called English Musical Renaissance), English composers turned to the masque as a way of connecting to a genuinely English musical-dramatic form in their attempts to build a historically informed national musical style for England. Examples include those by Arthur Sullivan, George Macfarren, and even Edward Elgar, whose imperialistic &quot;The Crown of India&quot; was the central feature at the London Coliseum in 2005. Masques also became common as scenes in operettas and musical theatre works set during the Elizabethan period.

In the 20th century, Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote several masques, including his masterpiece in the genre, &quot;Job, a masque for dancing&quot; which premiered in 1930, although the work is closer to a ballet than a masque as it was originally understood. His designating it a masque was to indicate that the modern choreography typical when he wrote the piece would not be suitable. Vaughan Williams&#x27; protégé Elizabeth Maconchy composed a masque, &quot;The Birds&quot; (1967–68), an &quot;extravaganza&quot; after Aristophanes.

Constant Lambert also wrote a piece he called a masque, &quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Will and Testament&quot;, for orchestra, chorus and baritone. His title he took from Thomas Nash, whose masque was probably first presented before the Archbishop of Canterbury, perhaps at his London seat, Lambeth Palace, in 1592.

<text>A masquerade ball (or bal masqué) is a special kind of formal ball which many participants attend in costume wearing masks. (Compare the word &quot;masque&quot;—a formal written and sung court pageant.) Less formal &quot;costume parties&quot; may be a descendant of this tradition. A masquerade ball usually encompasses music and dancing. These nighttime events are used for entertainment and celebrations. 

== History ==

Masquerade balls were a feature of the Carnival season in the 15th century, and involved increasingly elaborate allegorical Royal Entries, pageants, and triumphal processions celebrating marriages and other dynastic events of late medieval court life. The &quot;Bal des Ardents&quot; (&quot;Burning Men&#x27;s Ball&quot;) was held by Charles VI of France, and intended as a &quot;Bal des sauvages&quot; (&quot;Wild Men&#x27;s Ball&quot;), a form of costumed ball (&quot;morisco&quot;). It took place in celebration of the marriage of a lady-in-waiting of Charles VI of France&#x27;s queen in Paris on January 28, 1393. The King and five courtiers dressed as wildmen of the woods (woodwoses), with costumes of flax and pitch. If they came too close to a torch, the dancers would catch fire. (This episode may have influenced Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;Hop-Frog&quot;.) Such costumed dances were a special luxury of the Ducal Court of Burgundy.

Masquerade balls were extended into costumed public festivities in Italy during the 16th century Renaissance (Italian ). They were generally elaborate dances held for members of the upper classes, and were particularly popular in Venice. They have been associated with the tradition of the Venetian Carnival. With the fall of the Venetian Republic at the end of the 18th century, the use and tradition of masks gradually began to decline, until they disappeared altogether.
They became popular throughout mainland Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, sometimes with fatal results. In 1792 Gustav III of Sweden was assassinated at a masquerade ball by the disgruntled nobleman Jacob Johan Anckarström, an event which Eugène Scribe and Daniel Auber turned into the opera &quot;Gustave III&quot;. The same event was the basis of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;A Masked Ball&quot;, although the censors in the original production forced him to portray it as a fictional story set in Boston. Most masks came from countries like Switzerland and Italy.

A Swiss count who arrived in Italy in 1708, is credited with introducing to London the Venetian fashion of a semi-public masquerade ball, to which one might subscribe, with the first being held at Haymarket Opera House. London&#x27;s public gardens, like Vauxhall Gardens, refurbished in 1732, and Ranelagh Gardens, provided optimal outdoor settings, where characters masked and in fancy dress mingled with the crowds. The reputation for unseemly behavior, unescorted women and assignations motivated a change of name, to the Venetian , but as &quot;The Man of Taste&quot; observed in 1733:

A standard item of masquerade dress was a &quot;Vandyke&quot;, improvised on the costumes worn in the portraits of Van Dyck: Gainsborough&#x27;s &quot;Blue Boy&quot; is the most familiar example, and a reminder of the later 18th-century popularity in England for portraits in fancy dress.

Throughout the century, it is thought that masquerade dances became popular in Colonial America, however, portraits featured the subjects dressed as if they were attendees, but evidence is scant, according to Jennifer Van Horne, that colonials in North Americans actually had the events. Its prominence in England did not go unchallenged; a significant anti-masquerade movement grew alongside the balls themselves. The anti-masquerade writers (among them such notables as Samuel Richardson) held that the events encouraged immorality and &quot;foreign influence&quot;. While they were sometimes able to persuade authorities to their views, particularly after the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, enforcement of measures designed to end masquerades was at best desultory, and the masquerades went on as semi-private &quot;subscriptions&quot;. In the 1770s, fashionable Londoners went to the masquerades organized by Teresa Cornelys at Carlisle House in Soho Square, and later to the Pantheon.

Masquerade balls were sometimes set as a game among the guests. The masked guests were supposedly dressed so as to be unidentifiable. This would create a type of game to see if a guest could determine each other&#x27;s identities. This added a humorous effect to many masquerades and enabled a more enjoyable version of typical balls.

One of the most noted masquerade balls of the 20th century was that held at Palazzo Labia in Venice on 3 September 1951, hosted by Carlos de Beistegui. It was dubbed &quot;the party of the century&quot;.

Another famous ball was The Black and White Ball. It held on November 28, 1966, at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Hosted by author Truman Capote, the ball was in honor of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; publisher Katharine Graham.

== Masks ==
Masquerade masks were worn delicately by the prosperous class at balls. Masquerade masks had many uses including hiding one&#x27;s identity, and using different colour to express one&#x27;s freedom of speech and voice one&#x27;s emotions and opinions without judgement. There were two types of base masquerade masks; black masks and white masks. Designs and patterns were created over the base that was chosen. The main types of masks included masks with a stick (which one could hold to keep the mask in front of their face), the head mask, the full-face mask, and the half face mask. Masquerade masks have been used in classics such as &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Lone Ranger&quot;, and &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;. They are still used in many types of media today.

== Contemporary era ==
=== In French Guiana ===
In French Guiana, throughout the Carnival period, masked balls (known as paré-masked balls) take place every weekend. These are called Touloulous balls, where the Touloulous (women) are completely disguised and unrecognizable. Recently the Tololos (men) have also taken to wearing disguises.

=== In North America ===
A new resurgence of masquerade balls began in the late 1990s in North America. More recently, the party atmosphere is emphasized and the formal dancing usually less prominent. In present times, masquerade masks are used for costumes during Halloween. Masquerade masks are sold in a wide range of stores in different designs, and colors.

== Cultural references ==
The picturesque quality of the masquerade ball has made it a favorite topic or setting in literature.

*Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; is based at a masquerade ball in which a central figure turns out to be his costume.
*A ball in Zürich is featured in the novel &quot;Steppenwolf&quot; by Hermann Hesse.
*A masquerade ball is central to the plot of Mikhail Lermontov&#x27;s 1835 play &quot;Masquerade&quot;. The play was censored and never staged during Lermontov&#x27;s lifetime, partly because of the implied criticism of the masquerade balls staged by the aristocratic Engelhardt family.
*The book, musical and most film adaptations of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; have a scene at a masked ball. The Phantom&#x27;s (Erik&#x27;s) costume is that of the Red Death from the aforementioned Edgar Allan Poe story &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot;.
*In the play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; by William Shakespeare, Romeo meets Juliet at a masquerade ball.
*The video game &quot;Dishonored&quot; has a mission called Lady Boyle&#x27;s Last Party, taking place at a masquerade where the primary objective is discerning the identity of Lady Boyle, a masked party-goer.
*The video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot; has a series of missions called Carnevale set during Venetian Carnival where the primary objective is to gain access to one of the more prestigious masquerade balls, ending in the mission which primarily takes place in the masquerade ball.
*The video game &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot; features a mission set at a masquerade ball, on the Vegelbud estate, where the primary objective is to find the owner&#x27;s son who is wearing a panther mask.

<doc id="74912" wikidata="Q2733456" url="?curid=74912" title="Love Finds Andy Hardy">
<text>Love Finds Andy Hardy is a 1938 American romantic comedy film that tells the story of a teenage boy who becomes entangled with three different girls all at the same time. It stars Mickey Rooney, Lewis Stone, Fay Holden, Cecilia Parker, Judy Garland, Lana Turner, Ann Rutherford, Mary Howard and Gene Reynolds.

The screenplay was written by William Ludwig, from stories by Vivien R. Bretherton, and based upon characters created by Aurania Rouverol. It was directed by George B. Seitz. In 2000, &quot;Love Finds Andy Hardy&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

This was the first film in which Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer recorded at least part of the soundtrack in stereophonic sound, a practice which was used for a number of MGM musical comedies beginning the late 1930s. The film was presented in standard monaural sound.

==Plot==
It is December 1938 in the town of Carvel. Andy Hardy (Mickey Rooney) is putting a down payment on a used car, desperate to take his girlfriend Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford) to the Christmas Eve dance in his own car. When Polly tells Andy she will be visiting her grandmother for the next three weeks and will not be able to attend the Christmas Eve dance with him, Andy vows to attend the dance alone. Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone), Andy&#x27;s father, later encounters his son, who broaches the subject of car ownership, but Judge Hardy tells Andy that he cannot have his own car.

Returning home for the evening, Judge Hardy runs into 12-year-old Betsy Booth (Judy Garland), who is staying with her grandparents for the Christmas holiday. Betsy&#x27;s grandmother has been effusive about Andy Hardy and Betsy is thrilled to learn he will be her next door neighbor during her stay. Judge Hardy&#x27;s wife, Emily (Fay Holden), receives a telegram that evening informing her that her mother has had a stroke. Emily and her sister leave immediately for rural Canada to care for their mother. Andy meets Betsy while delivering some of his mother&#x27;s freshly canned preserves. Betsy is obviously taken with Andy but he does not reciprocate her admiration; he leaves as quickly as possible.

Breakston), Andy&#x27;s friend, asks Andy to date Cynthia (Lana Turner), Beezy&#x27;s girlfriend, while Beezy is out of town over the Christmas holiday period, so that she will avoid other men. Beezy promises to pay Andy $8 plus 50 cents a week for expenses for his efforts. Andy needs the money to purchase his car, so he agrees. Andy starts going out with Cynthia, but she is bored by sports activities, and they find they only get along when they are busy kissing; after walking Cynthia home Andy stops in to visit Betsy Booth—only he&#x27;s covered in Cynthia&#x27;s lipstick. Betsy gives Andy a handsome new radiator cap for his anticipated car, and, after he leaves, she sadly sings “In-Between.”

One morning, Andy receives a telegram from Polly saying she will be home for the Christmas Eve dance after all. Andy telephones her saying he can&#x27;t take her to the dance because of a previous engagement. He thereafter opens a letter from Beezy. Beezy wrote saying he found a new girlfriend so he will not pay Andy for dating Cynthia. Betsy, from a moneyed family, offers to help Andy pay for his car, but he refuses her aid. That evening, he tells his father about the mess he made. Judge Hardy explains his point of view about spending money on a car versus putting it aside as savings—and then discloses his deep concern for Andy&#x27;s mother. Judge Hardy would like to convey a message to his wife, but there is no telephone at her mother&#x27;s home and Emily finds telegrams unnerving.

Andy suggests a message be sent to their mother via ham radio in lieu of sending her a telegram. Andy brings Judge Hardy to the home of twelve-year-old ham radio operator James McMann Jr. (Gene Reynolds) and he sends a message to Mrs. Hardy in Brigham, Quebec. Judge Hardy is so impressed with James&#x27;s help and his son&#x27;s ingenuity that he pays the last $8 for Andy&#x27;s car.

Betsy deceives Cynthia into thinking that Andy&#x27;s car is an absolute wreck; Cynthia haughtily refuses to go to the Christmas Eve dance with Andy. Andy feels relieved to be able to date Polly again. Andy tries to clear things up with Polly but, having learned of his fling with Cynthia, she angrily tells Andy that she won&#x27;t go to the dance with him because she has a date with a college boy. Christmas Eve finds Andy wholly dejected at the prospect of not having a date for the dance—but when Betsy comes over in her evening gown he decides to take her to the dance.

At the dance, Polly&#x27;s date recognizes Betsy as an accomplished singer and asks her to perform; Andy is scared that she will embarrass him, but she proves to be a fantastic singer and quickly wins over the crowd with “It Never Rains But it Pours” and encores with “Meet the Beat of My Heart.” Betsy and Andy lead the dance in a grand march after Polly leaves in tears. Late that evening at home after the dance, Betsy Booth and the Hardy family are gathered together around the Christmas tree when Mrs. Hardy unexpectedly returns home—her mother is getting better.

On Christmas Day, Betsy explains everything to Polly. Polly and her date from the dance come over to the Hardy home, and Polly&#x27;s date turns out to be her cousin. Polly&#x27;s cousin then meets Andy&#x27;s sister, and they leave together. Betsy expresses her gratitude to Andy for a wonderful evening and leaves. Polly and Andy make up.

<text>Love Me Tonight is a 1932 American pre-Code musical comedy film produced and directed by Rouben Mamoulian, with music by Rodgers and Hart. It stars Maurice Chevalier as a tailor who poses as a nobleman and Jeanette MacDonald as a princess with whom he falls in love. It also stars Charles Ruggles as a penniless nobleman, along with Charles Butterworth and Myrna Loy as members of his family.

The film is an adaptation by Samuel Hoffenstein, George Marion Jr. and Waldemar Young of the play &quot;Le Tailleur au château&quot; (&quot;The tailor at the castle&quot;) by Paul Armont and Léopold Marchand.

==Plot==
The story describes an encounter between a Parisian tailor named Maurice Courtelin (Chevalier) and a family of local aristocrats. These include Vicomte Gilbert de Varèze (Ruggles), who owes Maurice a large amount of money for tailoring work; Gilbert&#x27;s uncle the Duc d&#x27;Artelines (C. Aubrey Smith), the family patriarch; d&#x27;Artelines&#x27; man-hungry niece Valentine (Loy); and his other 22-year-old niece, Princesse Jeanette (MacDonald), who has been a widow for three years. D&#x27;Artelines has been unable to find Jeanette a new husband of suitable age and rank. The household also includes three aunts and an ineffectual suitor the Comte de Savignac (Butterworth).

Maurice custom-tailors clothing for de Varèze on credit, but the Vicomte&#x27;s unpaid tailoring bills become intolerable, so Maurice travels to d&#x27;Artelines’ castle to collect the money owed to him. On the way, he has a confrontation with Princesse Jeanette. He immediately professes his love for her, but she haughtily rejects him.
When Maurice arrives at the castle, Gilbert introduces him as &quot;Baron Courtelin&quot; in order to hide the truth from the Duc. Maurice is fearful of this scheme at first, but changes his mind when he sees Jeanette. While staying at the castle, he arouses Valentine&#x27;s desire, charms the rest of the family except for Jeanette, saves a deer&#x27;s life during a hunt, and continues to woo Jeanette. The Comte de Savignac discovers that Maurice is a fake, but the Vicomte then claims that Maurice is a royal who is traveling incognito for security reasons. Finally, Jeanette succumbs to Maurice&#x27;s charms, telling him &quot;Whoever you are, whatever you are, wherever you are, I love you.&quot;

When Maurice criticizes Jeanette&#x27;s tailor, the family confronts him for his rudeness, only to catch him and Jeanette alone with Jeanette partially undressed. Maurice explains that he is redesigning Jeanette&#x27;s riding outfit, and he proves this by successfully altering it, but in the process he is forced to reveal his true identity. Despite her earlier promise, Jeanette recoils from him and runs to her room on hearing that he is a commoner. The entire household is outraged, and Maurice leaves. However, as a train carries him back to Paris, Jeanette struggles with her fears, finally realizes her mistake, and catches up to the train on horseback. When the engineer refuses to stop the train, she rides ahead and stands on the track. The train stops, Maurice jumps out, and the two lovers embrace as steam from the train envelops them.

==Production==
This was Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s second motion picture. In 1930, dealing with losses from the stock market collapse in 1929, they accepted a lucrative three-picture contract from Jack Warner and went to Hollywood. Unfortunately the film they were assigned had one star who couldn&#x27;t sing and another with a very limited range, so they were limited in what they could write. When the film flopped in 1931, Warner quickly bought out their contract.

Later the same year, Paramount Publix, now Paramount Pictures, hired then to work on this film with singing stars Maurice Chevalier and Jeannette McDonald and innovative director Rouben Mamoulian, a recent immigrant from Armenia who had directed the play &quot;Porgy&quot; on Broadway three years earlier.

Working together the director and songwriters &quot;devised a singular method of staging a musical film using a previously underutilized tool: the camera itself,&quot; biographer Todd S. Purdum writes. Rodgers explained, &quot;What we had in mind was not only moving the camera and the performers, but having the entire scene move. There was no reason why a musical sequence could not be used like dialogue and be performed uninterrupted while the action took the story to whatever locations the director wanted.&quot;

Mamoulian opened the film, as he had &quot;Porgy&quot;, with &quot;a steadily growing symphony of everyday sounds as Paris awakens,&quot; what Chevalier&#x27;s character calls &quot;The Song of Paris.&quot; Barrios describes the opening in detail: &quot;As a bell tolls on the soundtrack, a series of shots show Paris in the early morning, each edit hitting with a chime. The camera focuses on a sleepy district where a laborer strikes the pavement with his pickax. Cut to a bum snoring in an alley, then a chairwoman sweeping a front step. Thump, snore, swish, and as more people begin their day the sounds grow in number and rhythm, the editing faster and more percussive. Clearly there’s a master in charge and his name is Mamoulian.&quot;

Purdum describes the next highlight: A few minutes later, as a brief scene of tailor Chevalier and a customer ends, &quot;he launches into one of Rodgers and Hart’s all-time great ballads, &quot;Isn’t It Romantic?&quot; Seamlessly, without a break, the scene shifts (as does the song) from the tailor, to the customer, to a passing taxi driver and his fare, to soldiers on a troop train, to a gypsy boy who overhears them, to a campfire where the music swells to the strains of gypsy violins, to the bedchamber of Princess Jeanette (played by Jeanette MacDonald) ... The lyrics—really snatches of rhyming sung dialogue—are so perfectly suited to the action that Hart had to write a more generic alternative for the published sheet music.&quot; Mamoulian&#x27;s pathbreaking technique was so successful that it has been used in complicated song and dance sequences ever since.

In addition to &quot;Isn’t It Romantic&quot;, the film features the classic Rodgers and Hart songs &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot;, &quot;Mimi&quot;, and &quot;Lover&quot;. &quot;Lover&quot; is sung not romantically, as it often is in nightclubs, but comically, as MacDonald&#x27;s character tries to control an unruly horse.

In his book &quot;Hollywood in the Thirties&quot;, John Baxter wrote, “If there is a better musical of the Thirties, one wonders what it can be.” In 1990, &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Post-1934 censorship==
For the post-Production Code (Breen Office) re-release (after 1934), &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot; was trimmed to 96 minutes. The missing eight minutes of footage have never been restored and are presumed lost. Known deletions include Myrna Loy&#x27;s portion of the &quot;Mimi&quot; reprise, as under the strictures of the Production Code, her negligee was deemed too revealing.

==Retrospective appraisal==
The film has been “dismissed” by a number of critics as an inferior facsimile of Paramount directors Ernst Lubitsch and Malcolm St. Clair. Film historian Tom Milne argues that, on the contrary, Mamoulian “left his masters far behind” inventing “a delicious parody” while Lubitsch’s handling of similar narratives “is merely romantic pastiche.” Milne considers it Mamoulian’s “first flawless masterpiece.”

Film critic Richard Barrios calls &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot; &quot;magical, rapturous, unique, charming, audacious, unforgettable, and, to beat a warhorse, masterpiece.&quot; He adds, &quot;It remains less well-known than it warrants even as vastly inferior works are enshrined. . . . It is, after all, quite a provable truth: &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot; is a great film, and along with &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; and a very few others it resides at the very pinnacle of movie musicals, and at the apex of art.&quot; In 1990, &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Biographer Marc Spergel notes a number of the devices Mamoulian brings to bear: “fast-and-slow motion, striking facial close-ups, and shadow-play.” Additionally, the exhibit shows the “montage style” of Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein in a number of sequences, notably the final chase scene between equestrian and locomotive.
Momoulian crafted the Love Me Tonight as a stylistic and thematic parody of those critically acclaimed films directed by Ernst Lubitsch in which Chevalier and MacDonald had recently appeared: The Love Parade (1929) and Monte Carlo (1930). whereas Lubitsch’s work is distinguished by its restraint and intimacy, a no less impressive achievement. Mamoulian’s directing delivers a cinematically “bravura” treatment of the material.

<doc id="74914" wikidata="Q207336" url="?curid=74914" title="Beatles for Sale">
<text>Beatles for Sale is the fourth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 4 December 1964 in the United Kingdom on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label. The album marked a departure from the upbeat tone that had characterised the Beatles&#x27; previous work, partly due to the band&#x27;s exhaustion after a series of tours that had established them as a worldwide phenomenon in 1964. &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was not widely available in the US until 1987, when the Beatles&#x27; catalogue was standardised for release on CD. Instead, eight of the album&#x27;s fourteen tracks appeared on Capitol Records&#x27; concurrent release, &quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot;, issued in North America only.

The sessions for &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; also produced a non-album single, &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; backed by &quot;She&#x27;s a Woman&quot; as the B-side. During the sessions, the band ventured into studio experimentation, such as employing a fade-in and incorporating guitar feedback, and supplemented the basic recordings with percussion instruments such as timpani, African hand drums, and chocalho. The album reflects the twin influences of country music and Bob Dylan, whom the Beatles met in New York in August 1964. Partly as a result of the group&#x27;s hectic schedule, only eight of the tracks are original compositions, with cover versions of songs by artists such as Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly and Little Richard being used to complete the album. The original songs introduced darker musical moods and more introspective lyrics, with John Lennon adopting an autobiographical perspective in &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot; and &quot;No Reply&quot;. Furthermore, the majority of the songs did not feature themes of love, with only three out of the fourteen tracks mentioning love in a positive light.

&quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; received favourable reviews in the UK musical press, where it held the number one spot for 11 of the 46 weeks that it spent in the top 20. The album was similarly successful in Australia, where the band&#x27;s cover of Berry&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; also topped the singles chart. One of the songs omitted from the US version of the album, &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;, became the Beatles&#x27; seventh number one in the US when issued as a single there in February 1965. In 2000, the album was voted number 204 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.
==Background==
When &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was being recorded, Beatlemania was at its peak. In early 1964, the Beatles had made waves with their television appearances in the US, sparking unprecedented demand for their records there. Over June and July, the band played concerts in Denmark, the Netherlands and Hong Kong, toured Australia and New Zealand, and then returned to Britain for a series of radio and television engagements and to promote their first feature film, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. After performing further concerts in Sweden, they began recording the new album in London in mid August, only to then depart for a month-long tour of North America. While in New York, the Beatles met American folk singer Bob Dylan, who introduced the band members to cannabis. Through Dylan&#x27;s example, the Beatles, particularly John Lennon, were encouraged to write more introspective lyrics than before. For his part, Dylan said he recognised that the Beatles &quot;were pointing the direction that music had to go&quot;, and he soon began writing songs that embraced youth culture and recording with a rock backing.

&quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was the Beatles&#x27; fourth album release in the space of 21 months. Neil Aspinall, the band&#x27;s road manager, later reflected: &quot;No band today would come off a long US tour at the end of September, go into the studio and start a new album, still writing songs, and then go on a UK tour, finish the album in five weeks, still touring, and have the album out in time for Christmas. But that&#x27;s what the Beatles did at the end of 1964. A lot of it was down to naiveté, thinking that this was the way things were done. If the record company needs another album, you go and make one.&quot; Noting the subdued and melancholy tone of much of the album, producer George Martin recalled: &quot;They were rather war weary during &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;. One must remember that they&#x27;d been battered like mad throughout 1964, and much of 1963. Success is a wonderful thing but it is very, very tiring.&quot;

==Songwriting and musical styles==
Although prolific, the songwriting partnership of Lennon and Paul McCartney was unable to keep up with the demand for new material. To make up for the shortfall in output, the Beatles resorted to including several cover versions on the album. This had been their approach for their first two albums – &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;With the Beatles&quot; – but had been abandoned for &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. McCartney said of the combination on &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;: &quot;Basically it was our stage show, with some new [original] songs.&quot;

The album features eight Lennon–McCartney compositions. In addition, the pair wrote both sides of the non-album single, &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; backed with &quot;She&#x27;s a Woman&quot;, which accompanied the LP&#x27;s release. At this stage in their partnership, Lennon and McCartney rarely wrote together as before, but each would often contribute key parts to songs for which the other was the primary author. Nevertheless, Lennon&#x27;s level of contribution to &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; outweighed McCartney&#x27;s, a situation that, as on &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, author Ian MacDonald attributes to McCartney&#x27;s commitment being temporarily sidetracked by his relationship with English actress Jane Asher.

At the time, Lennon said of the album: &quot;You could call our new one a Beatles country and western LP.&quot; Music critic Tim Riley views the album as a &quot;country excursion&quot;, while MacDonald describes it as being &quot;dominated by the [country-and-western] idiom&quot;. The impetus for this new direction came partly from the band&#x27;s exposure to US country radio stations while on tour;&lt;ref name=&quot;Quantick/BBC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, it was a genre that Ringo Starr had long championed. Lennon&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot; was the first Beatles song to directly reflect Dylan&#x27;s influence. Author Jonathan Gould highlights the influence of blues and country-derived rockabilly on the album&#x27;s original compositions and in the inclusion of songs by Carl Perkins and Buddy Holly. He also comments that Dylan&#x27;s acoustic folk sound was a style that the Beatles tended to identify as country music.

McCartney later said that &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; inaugurated a more mature phase for the band, whereby: &quot;We got more and more free to get into ourselves. Our student selves rather than &#x27;we must please the girls and make money&#x27; …&quot; According to author Peter Doggett, this period coincided with Lennon and McCartney being feted by London society, from which the pair found inspiration among a network of non-mainstream writers, poets, comedians, film-makers and other arts-related individuals. Doggett says that their social milieu in 1964 represented &quot;new territory for pop&quot; and a challenge to British class delineation as the Beatles introduced an &quot;arty middle-class&quot; sensibility to pop music.

==Recording==
The sessions for &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; began at EMI Studios on 11 August, one month after the release of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. The majority of the recording sessions took place during a three-week period beginning on 29 September, following the band&#x27;s return from the US tour. Much of the production was done on &quot;days off&quot; from performances in the UK, and much of the songwriting was completed in the studio.

George Harrison recalled that the band had become more sophisticated about recording techniques: &quot;Our records were progressing. We&#x27;d started out like anyone spending their first time in a studio – nervous and naive and looking for success. By this time we&#x27;d had loads of hits and were becoming more relaxed with ourselves, and more comfortable in the studio …&quot; The band continued to develop their sound through the use of four-track recording, which EMI had introduced in 1963. They were also allowed greater freedom to experiment by the record company and by George Martin, who was gradually relinquishing his position of authority over the Beatles, as their label boss, throughout 1964, and was increasingly open to their non-standard musical ideas. The sessions resulted in the first use of a fade-in on a pop song, at the start of &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;, and the first time that guitar feedback had been incorporated in a pop recording, on &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;.

The band introduced new instrumentation into their basic sound, as a way to illustrate the more nuanced style adopted by Lennon in his lyric writing. This was especially evident in the range of percussion instruments, which, mainly played by Starr, included the band&#x27;s first use of timpani, African hand drums and chocalho. According to MacDonald, the Beatles adopted a &quot;less-is-more&quot; approach in their arrangements; he cites &quot;No Reply&quot; as an example of the group beginning to &quot;master the studio&quot;, whereby doubling basic parts and the use of reverb lent the performance &quot;depth and space&quot;. As he had done since &quot;With the Beatles&quot;, Harrison continued to vary his guitar sounds, favouring a Gretsch Tennessean guitar for the first time, in addition to using his twelve-string Rickenbacker 360/12. Author André Millard describes this period as one in which the recording studio changed its identity from the Beatles&#x27; perspective, from a formal workplace into a &quot;workshop&quot; and &quot;laboratory&quot;.

Recording was completed on 26 October, partway through the band&#x27;s four-week tour of the UK. On 18 October, the Beatles had rushed back to London from Hull, to record the A-side of their forthcoming single, &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, and three of the album&#x27;s cover tunes (in a total of five takes). In an interview published the day before this session, Lennon admitted that the need for new original songs was &quot;becoming a hell of a problem&quot;. The band participated in several mixing and editing sessions before completing the project on 4 November.

==Songs==
===Original compositions===

====&quot;No Reply&quot;====
&quot;No Reply&quot; is about a young man who is unable to contact his apparently unfaithful girlfriend, although he knows she is home. Beatles music publisher Dick James was pleased with the song, saying Lennon had provided &quot;a complete story&quot;. Reviewer David Rowley said that its lyrics &quot;read like a picture story from a girl&#x27;s comic&quot; and evoked a picture &quot;of walking down a street and seeing a girl silhouetted in a window, not answering the telephone&quot;. Sequenced as the first track on &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;, the song served as an uncharacteristic album opener, given its dramatic and resentful mood.

MacDonald attributes effectiveness to the acoustic guitar backing and the treatment given to Martin&#x27;s piano part, which is rendered as &quot;a darkly reverbed presence&quot; rather than a distinct instrument. The vocals on the song are &quot;massively haloed in echo&quot;, contributing to a mid-section providing &quot;among the most exciting thirty seconds&quot; of all the Beatles&#x27; recordings.

====&quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot;====
Music critic Richie Unterberger singles out &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot; as &quot;one of the very first Beatles compositions with lyrics addressing more serious points than young love&quot;. Rowley considered it to be an &quot;obvious copy of Bob Dylan&quot;, as when Lennon refers to the listener as a &quot;friend&quot;, Dylan does the same on &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;. He also said its intention was to &quot;openly subvert the simple true love themes of their earlier work&quot;. In Riley&#x27;s view, &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot; inaugurates a theme in Lennon&#x27;s writing, in which his songs serve as &quot;personal responses to fame&quot;.

====&quot;Baby&#x27;s in Black&quot;====
As the third track on the album, &quot;Baby&#x27;s in Black&quot; conveys the same sad and resentful outlook of the two preceding songs. Unterberger views it as &quot;a love lament for a grieving girl that was perhaps more morose than any previous Beatles song&quot;. It was the first song recorded for the album and features a two-part harmony sung by Lennon and McCartney. McCartney recalled: &quot;&#x27;Baby&#x27;s in Black&#x27; we did because we liked waltz-time ... And I think also John and I wanted to do something bluesy, a bit darker, more grown-up, rather than just straight pop.&quot; Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn cites the band&#x27;s dedication to achieving a discordant twanging sound for Harrison&#x27;s lead guitar part, and Martin&#x27;s objection to the song opening with this sound, as an example of the Beatles breaking free of their producer&#x27;s control for the first time. To achieve the desired swelling effect, Lennon knelt on the studio floor and altered the volume control on Harrison&#x27;s Gretsch as he played.

====&quot;I&#x27;ll Follow the Sun&quot;====
&quot;I&#x27;ll Follow the Sun&quot; was a reworking of an old song. McCartney recalled in a 1988 interview: &quot;I wrote that in my front parlour in Forthlin Road. I was about 16 ... We had this R&amp;B image in Liverpool, a rock and roll/R&amp;B/hardish image with the leather. So I think songs like &#x27;I&#x27;ll Follow the Sun&#x27;, ballads like that, got pushed back to later.&quot; Author Mark Hertsgaard cites its inclusion as a reflection of the shortage of original material available to the band, since McCartney acknowledged that the song &quot;wouldn&#x27;t have been considered good enough&quot; for their previous releases. Martin nevertheless later named it as his favourite song on &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;.

====&quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;====
&quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; marked the first time the Beatles brought a partly formed song into the studio and completed the writing process as they recorded it. Two recording sessions, totalling nearly seven hours, on 6 October were devoted to the song, during which Lennon and McCartney experimented with various techniques before settling on a final structure and arrangement. Each of the first six takes featured a strikingly different approach to the beginning and end sections of the song; the eventual chiming guitar-based introduction was recorded during a different session and edited in later. The song&#x27;s opening fade-in served as a counterpoint to pop songs that close with a fade out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unterberger/EightDays&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hertsgaard writes that the surprise provided by the fade-in was heightened for LP listeners due to the track being sequenced at the start of side two. Lennon was later highly dismissive of &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;, referring to it in a 1980 interview as &quot;lousy&quot;.

====&quot;Every Little Thing&quot;====
The dark theme of the album was balanced by &quot;Every Little Thing&quot;, which Unterberger describes as a &quot;celebration of what a wonderful girl the guy has&quot;. McCartney said of the song: &quot;&#x27;Every Little Thing&#x27;, like most of the stuff I did, was my attempt at the next single ... but it became an album filler rather than the great almighty single. It didn&#x27;t have quite what was required.&quot; Musicologist Walter Everett says the chorus&#x27;s incorporation of &quot;leaden&quot; parallel fifth harmonies, supported by Starr&#x27;s timpani, was the inspiration for a proto-heavy metal version of the song recorded by the English progressive rock band Yes in 1969.

====&quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Spoil the Party&quot;====
Lennon&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Spoil the Party&quot; returns to the sombre mood established by the opening three tracks. MacDonald considers the performance to be the album&#x27;s &quot;most overt exercise in country-and-western&quot;, aided by the tight snare sound, Harrison&#x27;s rockabilly-style guitar solo, and the despondent minor-third harmony part. MacDonald likens the effect to &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot;, in that Lennon&#x27;s confessional tone is again couched in &quot;a protective shell of pastiche&quot;.

====&quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot;====
The lyrics of &quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot; concern McCartney&#x27;s relationship with Jane Asher and demonstrate an aggrieved tone that was uncharacteristic of his writing. Author Simon Philo identifies the song&#x27;s combination of musical arrangement, &quot;sonic texture&quot; and lyrics as an early example of the influence of cannabis on McCartney, who said the drug made him start &quot;really thinking for the first time&quot;. The recording features a syncopated drum pattern and a jangly Rickenbacker guitar riff, as well as an instrumental coda that McCartney introduces by playing high up on the neck of his Höfner bass. A satisfactory arrangement proved elusive until the band remade the track on the final day of the &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; sessions. While highlighting the studio techniques used to achieve the completed recording, MacDonald considers &quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot; to be a possible rival to &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; as the Beatles&#x27; &quot;first sound experiment&quot;.

===Cover versions===
Several of the album&#x27;s cover versions had been staples of the Beatles&#x27; live shows in Hamburg and at The Cavern Club in Liverpool during the early 1960s. These songs included Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;, sung by Lennon, Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Words of Love&quot;, sung by Lennon and McCartney with Harrison, and two by Carl Perkins: &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Trying to Be My Baby&quot;, sung by Harrison, and &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t&quot;, sung by Starr. &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot;, which was originally recorded by Dr. Feelgood and the Interns, was Lennon&#x27;s &quot;beloved obscurity&quot;, according to Erlewine, and the subject of a remake towards the end of the &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; sessions. A cover of Little Willie John&#x27;s &quot;Leave My Kitten Alone&quot; was taped on 14 August, during the same session as the discarded version of &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot;, but was omitted from the album.

A medley of &quot;Kansas City&quot; and &quot;Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey&quot; was sequenced as the final song on side one of the LP. In McCartney&#x27;s description, his performance on the track required &quot;a great deal of nerve to just jump up and scream like an idiot&quot;; his efforts were egged on by Lennon, who &quot;would go, &#x27;Come on! You can sing it better than that, man! Come on, come on! Really throw it!&#x27;&quot; The medley was inspired by Little Richard, who similarly combined Leiber and Stoller&#x27;s &quot;Kansas City&quot; with his own composition, &quot;Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!&quot; Riley considers that, although McCartney&#x27;s presence on &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; appears relatively slight next to Lennon&#x27;s, his performance of &quot;Kansas City&quot; goes some way to readdressing the balance. Hertsgaard says that the irony evident in Harrison&#x27;s delivery of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Trying to Be My Baby&quot; &quot;allows the Beatles to close the album with a not-so-veiled comment on the oddities of living inside Beatlemania&quot;.

==Artwork==
The downbeat mood of &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was reflected in the album cover, which shows the unsmiling, weary-looking Beatles in an autumn scene in London&#x27;s Hyde Park. The cover photograph was taken by Robert Freeman, who recalled that the concept was briefly discussed with Brian Epstein and the Beatles beforehand, namely that he produce a colour image of the group shot at &quot;an outside location towards sunset&quot;. Music journalist Lois Wilson describes the result as &quot;the very antithesis of the early-&#x27;60s pop star&quot;. The cover carried no band logo or artist credit, and the album title was rendered in minuscule type compared with standard LP artwork of the time.

&quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was presented in a gatefold sleeve – a rare design feature for a contemporary pop LP and the first of the Beatles&#x27; UK releases to be packaged in this way. Part of the inner gatefold spread showed the band members in front of a photo montage of celebrities, including film stars Victor Mature, Jayne Mansfield and Ian Carmichael, all of whom the Beatles had met during 1964. This inner gatefold image anticipated Peter Blake&#x27;s revolutionary cover design for the Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

According to music journalist Neil Spencer, the album&#x27;s title was an apt comment on the band&#x27;s unprecedented commercial value as entertainers, given the wealth of Beatles-related merchandise introduced over the previous year. The sleeve notes for &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; were written by Derek Taylor, who, until a recent falling out with Epstein, had been the band&#x27;s press officer throughout their rise to international stardom. In his text, Taylor focused on what the Beatles phenomenon would mean to people of the future:

==Release==

&quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label on 4 December 1964. On 14 November, four days after completing their UK tour, the Beatles filmed mimed performances of &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;, along with both sides of the &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; single, for broadcast on a special edition of the TV show &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;. The band also promoted the two records with a BBC Light Programme session, for which they recorded live versions of &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot;, &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Trying to Be My Baby&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Follow the Sun&quot;, and an appearance on &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, where &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was represented by mimed performances of &quot;Baby&#x27;s in Black&quot; and &quot;Kansas City / Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey&quot;. The group included &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Trying to Be My Baby&quot;, &quot;Baby&#x27;s in Black&quot;, &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; in the set list for their &quot;Another Beatles&#x27; Christmas Show&quot; presentation, held at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon from 24 December until 16 January 1965.

The album began its 46-week run on the UK charts on 12 December, and a week later displaced &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; from the top position. After seven weeks at number 1, &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was displaced by the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;The Rolling Stones No. 2&quot; but it returned to the top on 27 February 1965 for a week. After being again displaced by &quot;The Rolling Stones No. 2&quot;, &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; overtook it for a second time on 1 May, remaining there for another three weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCC/Albums&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was then displaced by &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;, which was superseded a week later by &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, Dylan&#x27;s first &quot;electric&quot; album. From the start of 1965 until mid-May, &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; remained in the top three chart positions. Eight of the album&#x27;s tracks were later issued on two four-song EPs: &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; and &quot;Beatles for Sale No. 2&quot;, released in April and June 1965, respectively. In the UK, &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was the top-selling album of 1964 and the second-highest seller of 1965.

The concurrent Beatles release in the United States, &quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot;, included eight songs from &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;, omitting the tracks &quot;Kansas City / Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!&quot;, &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; (a number one hit single in the US in early 1965), &quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot;, &quot;Words of Love&quot;, &quot;Every Little Thing&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Spoil the Party&quot;. It instead included &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Back&quot;, which was one of the songs cut from the US version of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, and &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s a Woman&quot;. The six omitted tracks received an LP release in America on &quot;Beatles VI&quot; in 1965. &quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot; was released eleven days after &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; and became the fastest-selling album of the year in the United States.

The cover of the Australian release of the LP featured individual photographs of the Beatles taken at one of the group&#x27;s Sydney concerts in June 1964. Issued as a single in Australia, &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; was a number 1 hit there for four weeks. The song also topped singles charts in Norway and Sweden.

===CD release===
On 26 February 1987, &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was officially released on compact disc (catalogue number CDP 7 46438 2), as were the band&#x27;s first three albums. The following month, &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; re-entered the UK albums charts, peaking at number 45. Having been available previously only as an import in the US, the album was also issued on LP and cassette there on 21 July 1987.

Even though &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was recorded on four-track tape, the first CD version was available only in mono. The album was digitally remastered and issued on CD in stereo for the first time on 9 September 2009.

==Critical reception and legacy==

The album received favourable reviews in the UK musical press. Writing in the &quot;NME&quot;, Derek Johnson said that it was &quot;worth every penny asked&quot;, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s rip-roaring, infectious stuff, with the accent on beat throughout.&quot; Chris Welch of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; found the music &quot;honest&quot; and inventive, and predicted: &quot;&quot;Beatles For Sale&quot; is going to sell, sell, sell. It is easily up to standard and will knock out pop fans, rock fans, R&amp;B and Beatles fans …&quot;

In a more recent assessment, &quot;Q&quot; found the album title to hold a &quot;hint of cynicism&quot; in depicting the Beatles as a &quot;product&quot; to be sold. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that &quot;the weariness of &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; comes as something of a shock&quot; after &quot;the joyous &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;&quot;. He also cited it as &quot;the group&#x27;s most uneven album&quot; yet added that its best moments find them &quot;moving from Merseybeat to the sophisticated pop/rock they developed in mid-career&quot;.

Tom Ewing of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; said, &quot;Lennon&#x27;s anger and the band&#x27;s rediscovery of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll mean &quot;For Sale&quot;&#x27;s reputation as the group&#x27;s meanest album is deserved&quot;. Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commented that &quot;if this is a low point, they still sound fantastic&quot;, adding that &quot;the Beatlemania pop songs are of a high standard, even if they are becoming slightly generic.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Rob Sheffield said that the album contains some poor cover versions yet &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot; and &quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot; indicate that the band were continuing to progress. He added: &quot;The harmonies of &#x27;Baby&#x27;s in Black,&#x27; the hair-raising &#x27;I still loooove her&#x27; climax of &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Want to Spoil the Party,&#x27; the eager hand claps in &#x27;Eight Days a Week&#x27; – it all makes &#x27;Mr. Moonlight&#x27; easy to forgive.&quot; In his review for BBC Music, David Quantick highlights Lennon&#x27;s &quot;brilliant, throat-ripping version&quot; of &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; and describes the album as &quot;joyous, inventive and exciting&quot;, despite the Beatles&#x27; fatigue, and a &quot;transitional&quot; work that showed the group developing their studio craft.

&quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot; served as a precursor to the 1965 folk-rock explosion, which was led by the Byrds and defined by a combination of Dylanesque lyrics and Beatles-style harmonies. According to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Spoil the Party&quot; can be seen &quot;with hindsight&quot; as an early example of country rock, anticipating the Byrds&#x27; work in that style, particularly their 1968 album &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;. In a February 1970 interview following a recording session with Starr and Harrison, Stephen Stills, then part of the supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, said he first began listening to the Beatles around the time of &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;, adding: &quot;that&#x27;s still where I&#x27;m at, incidentally, and so is everybody else – and maybe at that time they were at their biggest and most isolated, and thus at their closest.&quot;

&quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was ranked the 71st-best album in the 1987 edition of Paul Gambaccini&#x27;s book &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice&quot;, based on submissions from an international panel of 81 critics and broadcasters. In 2000, it was voted number 204 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

<text>Magical Maestro is a 1952 American animated short comedy film directed by Tex Avery and produced by Fred Quimby for MGM Cartoons. Distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the short was released on February 9, 1952. It features the Great Poochini (played by Butch Dog), a canine opera singer who spurns a magician. The magician is able to replace Poochini&#x27;s normal conductor prior to the show through disguise. In 1993, &quot;Magical Maestro&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, making it the only Tex Avery cartoon so far to be inducted.

==Plot==
Attention-craving Mysto the Magician rudely interrupts a world-famous opera singer, the great Poochini (a pun on opera composer Giacomo Puccini), in the midst of his rehearsal to let him perform an opening act at the show that night. Mysto&#x27;s tricks primarily come from his magic wand, which can summon flowers and rabbits. After Mysto performs a poorly executed dance and asks him if he gets the job, an annoyed and unimpressed Poochini emphatically says &quot;NO!&quot; as he kicks Mysto out the door into the alley.

While on the ground, the self-pitying Mysto plays with his magic wand, but soon realizes he can pass it off as a conductor&#x27;s baton; being further inspired by seeing himself in place of the conductor in a promotional poster outside the door and plans to get revenge on Poochini. Later, as the performance is starting he freezes the conductor, steals his tuxedo, nose and hair; then takes his place in front of the orchestra to conduct the Poochini, who is unaware of the imposter in front of him.

During the performance, in which Poochini (performed by the Colombian baritone Carlos Julio Ramírez) sings &quot;Largo al factotum&quot; from Gioacchino Rossini&#x27;s 1816 opera &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, Mysto unleashes a variety of tricks with his wand. He begins tamely by summoning rabbits and flowers, then turning Poochini into a ballet dancer, an Indian, a tennis player, a prisoner rock-breaker, and a football player. Mysto&#x27;s revenge gets more brutal as he throws a cymbal on Poochini&#x27;s head, turning him Chinese and making him sing the Oriental riff; and next transforming him into a country singer and sings &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot;. After levitating Poochini to the ceiling and slamming him down to the stage, Mysto turns him into a square dance caller. Poochini actually continues his performance for a good 20 seconds after this without interruption, except for the &quot;hair gag&quot; where he removes a hair from the film gate and tosses it away.

Poochini is then transformed into a Shirley Temple-esque child (who sings &quot;A-Tisket, A-Tasket&quot; before the balloon blows up and pops), then a Carmen Miranda-type singer, singing &quot;Mamãe Eu Quero&quot; (with two rabbits accompanying him on guitar) after an irritated audience member hurls an armload of fruit onto Poochini&#x27;s head where it piles up like Miranda&#x27;s headdress. The same man later sprays black ink on Poochini from a fountain pen, turning him into Bill Kenny from the Ink Spots, then drops an anvil on top of him, crushing him into a shorter height and deepening his voice to that of the Ink Spots&#x27; bass, &quot;Hoppy&quot; Jones (parodying the Ink Spots&#x27; famous &quot;Top &amp; Bottom&quot; format). After a rabbit washes the ink off Poochini&#x27;s face with a fire hose and another rabbit works his arm like an automobile jack to get him back up to full height, the fun continues as he is transformed into a Hawaiian singer with two rabbits for harmony.

Reaching the end of the number, Mysto&#x27;s plan is finally revealed to Poochini as his wig falls off. Mysto quickly puts the wig back on, but it&#x27;s too late. Now set for revenge of his own, Poochini furiously grabs the hairpiece and puts it on while a now defeated and exposed Mysto cowardly tries to flee; but Poochini, having also grabbed the magic wand, stops the magician by using the wand on him as placing Mysto to the stage and unleashes the same gimmicks on the hapless magician at high speed. A red curtain with the words &quot;The End&quot; then falls on the magician and the rabbits (at the end of the Hawaiian singer shtick) thus ending the cartoon.

==Voice cast==
*Daws Butler as Mysto the Magician
*Carlos Ramirez as The Great Poochini (main singing voice)
**The Mary Kaye Trio as some of Pocchini&#x27;s comic voices
***Mary Kaye as Carmen Miranda Poochini
***Frank Ross as Chinese, Cowboy, Square-Dancer and Little Boy Poochini
***Frank Ross and Norman Kaye as Hawaiian singers
**Paul Frees as blackface singer Poochini
**Danny Webb as low-pitched blackface singer Poochini
**Tex Avery as Poochini&#x27;s speaking voice for a single line: &quot;NO!&quot;

==History==
The concept of cartoons with insinuating situations is hardly new—Tex Avery especially featured a few quick jokes of this nature in his cartoons. &quot;Magical Maestro&quot;, for example, shows Poochini with a male and female rabbit on each arm. He lowers his arms behind his back and when he raises them again, he now has an additional dozen baby rabbits on them, six on each arm.

This cartoon features a gimmick only seen in Tex Avery films, the &quot;hair gag&quot;. Because cartoons were shown originally in movie theatres, the film strip, if loaded incorrectly, would rub against the gate mechanism, shaving off tiny &quot;hairs&quot; of celluloid. These hairs would get caught in the &quot;gate&quot; of the projector. Sometimes it would skitter across the projection light, resulting in a gigantic hair appearing on the movie screen. In this cartoon, the opera singer pauses mid-song to pluck the offending hair from the film and tosses it aside, one of Avery&#x27;s many ways of his characters breaking the fourth wall. It wasn&#x27;t the first time Avery used this gag: it was also used in &quot;Aviation Vacation&quot; (1941).

The role of Poochini is portrayed by Butch the Irish dog, a frequent star of Avery&#x27;s cartoons of that era (often alongside Droopy).

==Influence==
The &quot;hair gag&quot; would later be used by English comedian Benny Hill in the closing chase sequence of his April 25, 1984 show. As he is being chased by medical staff and an ambulance in and around a hospital area, he notices a hair moving around the bottom right corner of the screen, and at a certain point stops his pursuers long enough for him to pluck the hair out before the chase resumes.

The &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales&quot; episode &quot;Way-Off Broadway&quot; features a gag similar to Poochini&#x27;s transformations, in that Tom is forced to adapt to various pieces music when Jerry changes them on a radio.

<text>The Apostolic Faith Church of Portland, Oregon, also known as the Apostolic Faith Mission of Portland, Oregon, is an international Holiness Pentecostal denomination of Christianity, with nationwide reach and headquartered in Portland, Oregon, United States. It was founded in 1907 by Florence L. Crawford, who was affiliated with William J. Seymour and the Azusa Street Revival of Los Angeles, California. By 1908 Crawford had independently founded what would become the Apostolic Faith Church. The Superintendent General of the Apostolic Faith Church is Olusola Adesope.

The Apostolic Faith Church has a presence in the United States, Canada and across Africa, Asia, Europe, Central and South America, and Australia. In 2023, the AFC had 2,396 churches served by 3,551 clergy across the globe. There are thirteen churches in Canada, fifty-nine in the United States, over one thousand in Africa, thirty throughout the Philippines, Korea, and Japan, fifty-four across Europe, and over one hundred in the Caribbean. Church-affiliated groups also regularly assemble in other parts of the world and recently include India. In some locations, member churches carry the name Trinity Apostolic Faith Church in order to differentiate themselves from non-affiliated churches in the same area.

==History==
The founder of the Apostolic Faith Church was Florence L. Crawford. Crawford was a participant in the Azusa Street Revival. This revival began in 1906 at the Apostolic Faith Mission in Los Angeles. The Azusa Street Mission, as it was called, quickly became the center of the Holiness Pentecostal movement mainly through the publication of &quot;The Apostolic Faith&quot; newspaper. Seymour appointed Crawford as the state director of the Pacific Coast Apostolic Faith movement where she would help other missions and churches join the movement. Crawford&#x27;s break with Seymour was complete by 1911. She began an independent work in Portland, Oregon, with the same name as Seymour&#x27;s mission and most of the churches under her supervision followed her.

This considerably weakened Seymour&#x27;s undisputed leadership of the burgeoning Pentecostal movement as most of the churches which had fed the movement chose alignment with Crawford. According to Crawford, the separation was necessitated by rumors that Seymour had abandoned the Wesleyan position that entire sanctification was a second work of grace after conversion. Crawford&#x27;s mission gained further influence when Clara Lum, editor of &quot;The Apostolic Faith&quot;, transferred the paper, under controversial circumstances, to the Portland mission in mid-1908. &quot;The Apostolic Faith&quot; title changed to the &quot;Light of Hope&quot; and then &quot;The Higher Way&quot; before reverting back to &quot;The Apostolic Faith&quot; in 2017, and it is still published today.

As part of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company received between $150,000 and $350,000 in federally backed small business loans from Columbia State Bank as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The company stated it would allow them to retain an unstated number of jobs.

==Doctrine==
Through the years, the Apostolic Faith Church&#x27;s leaders have maintained the doctrines outlined in Seymour&#x27;s editions of the &quot;Apostolic Faith&quot; papers printed in 1906 through 1908. As a Trinitarian and fundamental church, their doctrinal position centers on a born-again experience, supports the Wesleyan teaching of holiness (Christian perfection), and stresses the need of sanctified believers to receive the Pentecostal experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit; the Apostolic Faith Church teaches conditional security with respect to salvation. The Apostolic Faith Church affirms the doctrine of outward holiness, in which modesty in speech and dress is emphasized (including the non-use of jewelry), along with abstinence from alcohol and tobacco. Their teachings are in direct conflict with Calvinistic beliefs regarding sin, predestination, and eternal security.

The doctrinal statement of the Apostolic Faith Church can be found on the headquarters&#x27; website. The text of the page is reprinted below:
* &quot;The Divine Trinity&quot; consists of three Persons: God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Ghost, perfectly united as one. Matthew 3:16-17; 1 John 5:7.
* &quot;Repentance&quot; is a godly sorrow for sin with a renunciation of sin. Isaiah 55:7; Matthew 4:17.
* &quot;Salvation&quot; is the act of God&#x27;s grace whereby we receive forgiveness for sins and stand before God as though we had never sinned. Romans 5:1; 2 Corinthians 5:17.
* &quot;Entire Sanctification&quot; or Holiness, the act of God&#x27;s grace whereby we are made holy, is the second definite work and is subsequent to justification. John 17:15-21; Hebrews 13:12.
* &quot;The Baptism of the Holy Ghost&quot; is the enduement of power from on high upon the clean, sanctified life, and is evidenced by speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance. Luke 24:49; Acts 1:5-8; 2:1-4.
* &quot;Divine Healing&quot; of sickness is provided through the atonement. James 5:14-16; 1 Peter 2:24.
* &quot;The Second Coming of Jesus&quot; will be just as literal and visible as His going away. Acts 1:9-11. There will be two appearances under one coming: First, to catch away His waiting Bride. Matthew 24:40-44; 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17; second, to execute judgment upon the ungodly. 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10; Jude 14-15.
* &quot;The Great Tribulation&quot; will occur between Christ&#x27;s coming for His Bride and His return in judgment. Isaiah 26:20-21; Revelation 9 and 16.
* &quot;Christ&#x27;s Millennial Reign&quot; is the literal 1000 years of peaceful reign by Jesus on earth. Isaiah 11 and 35.
* &quot;The Great White Throne Judgment&quot; is the final judgment when all the wicked dead will stand before God. Revelation 20:11-15.
* &quot;The New Heaven and The New Earth&quot; will replace the present heaven and earth, which will be destroyed after the Great White Throne Judgment. 2 Peter 3:12-13; Revelation 21:1-3.
* &quot;Eternal Heaven and Eternal Hell&quot; are literal places of final destiny, each as eternal as the other. Matthew 25:41-46; Luke 16:22-28.
* &quot;Marriage is for Life&quot;, a holy institution that is binding before God, giving neither partner liberty to marry again as long as the first companion lives. Mark 10:6-12; Romans 7:1-3.
* &quot;Restitution&quot; is subsequent to salvation, wherein wrongs against our fellowmen are made right in order to have a clear conscience before God and man. Ezekiel 33:15; Matthew 5:23-24.
* &quot;Water Baptism&quot; is by one immersion &quot;in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,&quot; as Jesus commanded. Matthew 3:16; 28:19.
* &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot; is an institution ordained by Jesus so that we might remember His death until He returns. Matthew 26:26-29; 1 Corinthians 11:23,26.
* &quot;Washing the Disciples&#x27; Feet&quot; is practiced according to the example and commandment Jesus gave. John 13:14-15.

The denomination teaches that speaking in tongues is only acceptable in a human language, but one which the person speaking has never learned. They do not take a collection during services but have containers where donations can be deposited. Membership is not by formally joining the church but when one is &quot;saved&quot; one is considered a member. They are one of the early groups that had bus ministries, ministries to ships, nursing homes, street meetings, and jail meetings.

Literature is printed in many languages and is free. All literature is prayed over for the recipients to receive healing and answers to prayers from God. Services include instrumental and vocal music, congregational singing of hymns, a time for individuals to share personal testimonies, Scripture reading, and an inspired message based on the Bible. Many of the churches have a choir and orchestra. A prayer meeting is held before every service, and all meetings end with an altar call, with the altar being benches at the front of the sanctuary where everyone is invited to come pray together. Ministers are not formally trained but are chosen by elders who laid hands on the person after it was believed they were called.

<text>Manhatta (1921) is a short documentary film directed by painter Charles Sheeler and photographer Paul Strand.

==Production background==
&quot;Manhatta&quot; documents the early 20th-century look of Manhattan. With the city as subject, the film consists of 65 shots sequenced in a loose non-narrative structure, beginning with the Staten Island ferry approaching Manhattan and concludes with a sunset view from a skyscraper. Often considered by some to be the first American avant-garde film, its primary objective is to explore the relationship between photography and film. Camera movement is kept to a minimum, as is incidental motion within each shot. Each frame provides a view of the city that has been carefully arranged into abstract compositions.

&quot;Manhatta&quot; was a collaboration between painter/photographer Charles Sheeler and photographer Paul Strand. The film features intertitles that include excerpts from the writings of Walt Whitman.

==Preservation status==
In 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Restoration proved difficult, as the negative was lost, and only a single, heavily damaged 35mm print remained in existence. It was restored for the DVD set &quot;Unseen Cinema&quot; in October 2005. The film was completely restored in January 2009 by archivist Bruce Posner, in collaboration with film restoration company Lowry Digital. Posner spent close to four years returning the film to its original glory. The Museum of Modern Art and Anthology Film Archives also commissioned a new score from New York composer Donald Sosin.

<text>Manhattan is a 1979 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Woody Allen and produced by Charles H. Joffe from a screenplay written by Allen and Marshall Brickman. Allen co-stars as a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer who dates a 17-year-old girl (Mariel Hemingway) but falls in love with his best friend&#x27;s (Michael Murphy) mistress (Diane Keaton). Meryl Streep and Anne Byrne also star.

&quot;Manhattan&quot; was Allen&#x27;s first film in black-and-white, and was shot in 2.35:1 widescreen. It features music by George Gershwin, including &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, which inspired the film. Allen described the film as a combination of &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Interiors&quot;.

Upon its release in April 1979 by United Artists, &quot;Manhattan&quot; received critical acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Hemingway and Best Original Screenplay for Allen and Brickman. Its North American box-office receipts of $39.9 million made it Allen&#x27;s second biggest box-office success (adjusted for inflation). It ranks 46th on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs list and number 63 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==
The film opens with a montage of images of Manhattan and other parts of New York City accompanied by George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, with Isaac Davis narrating drafts of an introduction to a book about a man who loves the city. Isaac is a twice-divorced, 42-year-old television comedy writer who quits his boring job. He is dating Tracy, a 17-year-old girl attending the Dalton School. His best friend, college professor Yale Pollack, married to Emily, is having an affair with Mary Wilkie. Mary&#x27;s ex-husband and former teacher, Jeremiah, also appears, and Isaac&#x27;s ex-wife Jill is writing a confessional book about their marriage. Jill, who before their marriage told Isaac that she was bisexual, has since come out and lives with her lesbian partner, Connie.

When Isaac meets Mary, her cultural snobbery offends him. Isaac runs into her again at an Equal Rights Amendment fund-raising event at the Museum of Modern Art hosted by Bella Abzug and escorts her home. They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in a shot of the Queensboro Bridge. In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy but emphasizes that theirs cannot be a serious relationship and encourages her to go to London to study acting.

After Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests that Isaac ask her out. Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him. Isaac breaks up with Tracy, much to her distress, and before long, Mary has virtually moved into his apartment. Emily is curious about Isaac&#x27;s new girlfriend. The two couples enjoy a day out and upon walking down a street Isaac spots Jill&#x27;s new book, &quot;Marriage, Divorce, and Selfhood&quot;. Emily proceeds to read parts of the book aloud, including passages about a ménage à trois Isaac had with Jill and another woman, and an incident where Isaac attempted to run Connie over, much to Mary and Yale&#x27;s amusement. Publicly humiliated, Isaac confronts Jill, who responds nonchalantly and mentions a film rights deal she has acquired. Upon returning home, Isaac learns from Mary that she is returning to Yale and wants to break up. A furious Isaac confronts Yale at the college where he teaches, and Yale argues that he found Mary first. Isaac discusses Yale&#x27;s extramarital affairs with Emily and learns that Yale told her Isaac introduced Mary to him.

In the dénouement, Isaac lies on his sofa, musing into a tape recorder about the things that make &quot;life worth living&quot;. When he finds himself saying &quot;Tracy&#x27;s face&quot;, he sets down the microphone. Unable to reach her by phone, he sets out for Tracy&#x27;s on foot. He arrives at her family&#x27;s apartment building just as she is leaving for London. He asks her not to go and says he does not want &quot;that thing about [her] that [he] like[s]&quot; to change. She replies that the plans have already been made and reassures him that &quot;not everybody gets corrupted&quot; before saying &quot;you have to have a little faith in people&quot;. He gives her a slight smile, with a final look to the camera then segueing into final shots of the skyline with some bars of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; playing again. An instrumental version of &quot;Embraceable You&quot; plays over the credits.

==Production==

===Development===
According to Allen, the idea for &quot;Manhattan&quot; originated from his love of Gershwin&#x27;s music. He was listening to one of the composer&#x27;s albums of overtures and thought, &quot;this would be a beautiful thing to make ... a movie in black and white ... a romantic movie.&quot; Allen has said that &quot;Manhattan&quot; was &quot;like a mixture of what I was trying to do with &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Interiors&quot;&quot; and that it deals with the problem of people trying to live a decent existence in an essentially junk-obsessed contemporary culture without selling out, admitting that he himself could conceive of giving away all of his &quot;possessions to charity and living in much more modest circumstances,&quot; adding that he has &quot;rationalized [his] way out of it so far, but [he] could conceive of doing it.&quot;

In his autobiography &quot;Apropos Of Nothing&quot; (2020), Allen writes that Tracy is based on Stacey Nelkin, his real-life girlfriend in the second half of the 1970&#x27;s. When Allen and Marshall Brickman wrote the movie, &quot;we called the character Mariel Hemingway played &#x27;Tracy&#x27; instead of &#x27;Stacey&#x27; in a burst of creative inspiration. I know the picture did her justice, as we have remained friends still.&quot;

Forty years later, Christina &quot;Babi&quot; Engelhardt claimed that the film was partially based on her unconfirmed relationship with Allen, which allegedly began when she was 17 after they met at a restaurant in New York in 1976. But Nelkin, who dated Allen when she was 17 to 19, has confirmed that Tracy is based on her. Engelhardt later said she presumes that Tracy is &quot;a composite&quot; of Nelkin and &quot;any number&quot; of other &quot;presumed&quot; girls Allen was dating at the time, calling herself &quot;a fragment&quot;.

===Filming===
Allen talked to cinematographer Gordon Willis about how fun it would be to shoot the film in black and white, Panavision aspect ratio (2.35:1) because it would give &quot;a great look at New York City, which is sort of one of the characters in the film&quot;. Allen decided to shoot his film in black and white because that was how he remembered it from when he was small. &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s a reminiscence from old photographs, films, books and all that. But that&#x27;s how I remember New York.&quot; The film was shot on location with the exception of some of the scenes in the planetarium, which were filmed on a set.
The famous Queensboro Bridge shot was done at five in the morning. The production had to bring their own bench as there were no park benches at the location. The bridge had two sets of necklace lights on a timer controlled by the city. When the sun came up, the bridge lights went off. Willis made arrangements with the city to leave the lights on and that he would let them know when they got the shot. Afterward, they could be turned off. As they started to shoot the scene, one string of bridge lights went out, and Allen was forced to use that take.

After finishing the film, Allen was very unhappy with it and asked United Artists not to release it. He offered to make a film for no fee instead. He later said: &quot;I just thought to myself, &#x27;At this point in my life, if this is the best I can do, they shouldn&#x27;t give me money to make movies.&#x27;&quot;

===Music===

All titles of the soundtrack were compositions by George Gershwin. They were performed by the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta and the Buffalo Philharmonic under Michael Tilson Thomas.

==Release==
&quot;Manhattan&quot; premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on April 18, 1979. It opened in 27 theaters in New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto on April 25, then expanded to an additional 256 theaters nationwide on May 4, before adding a further 117 screens a week later. The film was shown out of competition at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival in May.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film grossed $485,734 ($16,749 per screen) in its opening weekend and after expanding nationwide, it had grossed $3.5 million after 13 days. It grossed $39.9 million in its entire run in the United States and Canada, making the film the 17th highest-grossing picture of the year. Adjusted for ticket price inflation (as of 2017), &quot;Manhattan&quot; grossed $141,484,800, making it Allen&#x27;s second biggest box-office hit, following 1977&#x27;s &quot;Annie Hall&quot;.

===Critical response===
The film received largely positive reviews and holds a rating of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 71 critics, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;One of Woody Allen&#x27;s early classics, &quot;Manhattan&quot; combines modern, bittersweet humor and timeless romanticism with unerring grace.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 83% based on 10 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Gary Arnold, in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote: &quot;&quot;Manhattan&quot; has comic integrity in part because Allen is now making jokes at the expense of his own parochialism. There&#x27;s no opportunity to heap condescending abuse on the phonies and sell-outs decorating the Hollywood landscape. The result appears to be a more authentic and magnanimous comic perception of human vanity and foolhardiness.&quot;

In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Jack Kroll wrote: &quot;Allen&#x27;s growth in every department is lovely to behold. He gets excellent performances from his cast. The increasing visual beauty of his films is part of their grace and sweetness, their balance between Allen&#x27;s yearning romanticism and his tough eye for the fatuous and sentimental – a balance also expressed in his best screen play [&quot;sic&quot;] yet.&quot;

In his contemporary review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert, who gave the film three and a half out of four stars at the time but gave it a full four in a 2001 retrospective review, wrote: &quot;Diane Keaton gives us a fresh and nicely edged New York intellectual. And Mariel Hemingway deserves some kind of special award for what&#x27;s in some ways the most difficult role in the film.&quot; Ebert included the film in his list of &quot;The Great Movies&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded it four out of four stars, calling it &quot;a remarkable motion picture. &quot;Manhattan&quot; may turn out to be the year&#x27;s best comedy &quot;and&quot; drama.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;extraordinarily fine and funny&quot; with &quot;superb&quot; performances from Keaton and Hemingway. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;harder, harsher, crueler, deeper-going, more assertive but in the end no less life-affirming than &quot;Annie Hall&quot;&quot;, and declared &quot;Manhattan&quot; &quot;even better&quot; than that film.

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Manhattan&quot; is a faulty film, but it&#x27;s moderately amusing&quot;. Alexander Walker of the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; wrote: &quot;So precisely nuanced is the speech, so subtle the behaviour of a group of friends, lovers, mistresses and cuckolds who keep splitting up and pairing off like unstable molecules&quot;.

====Retrospective reviews and lists====

In 2007, J. Hoberman wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;: &quot;The New York City that Woody so tediously defended in &quot;Annie Hall&quot; was in crisis. And so he imagined an improved version. More than that, he cast this shining city in the form of those movies that he might have seen as a child in Coney Island—freeing the visions that he sensed to be locked up in the silver screen.&quot;

In October 2013, readers of &quot;The Guardian&quot; voted it the best film directed by Woody Allen.

===Accolades===
New York Film Critics Circle named Allen best director for &quot;Manhattan&quot;. The National Society of Film Critics also named Allen best director along with Robert Benton, who directed &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;. The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress (Mariel Hemingway) and Best Original Screenplay (Allen and Marshall Brickman). It also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and the César Award for Best Foreign Film.

In &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2008 poll of the 500 greatest movies ever made, &quot;Manhattan&quot; was ranked number 76. &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list. The film was number 63 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed it &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. It is also ranked No. 4 on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; 25 Best Romantic Comedies.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #46
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – #66

==Home media==
Allen wanted to preserve Willis&#x27;s compositions and insisted that the aspect ratio be preserved when the film was released on video (an unusual request in a time when widescreen films were normally panned and scanned for TV and video release). As a result, all copies of the film on video (and most television broadcasts) were letterboxed, originally with a gray border.

&quot;Manhattan&quot; was first released on Blu-ray on January 24, 2012, alongside Allen&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;Annie Hall&quot;. Both releases included the films&#x27; original theatrical trailer.

==Legacy==
&quot;Manhattan&quot;″s screenplay was performed in front of a live audience at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 15, 2012, as part of Jason Reitman&#x27;s Live Read series. Actors read the script, narrowed to six speaking parts, and still photographs from the movie were projected behind them. The cast included Stephen Merchant as Isaac Davis, Olivia Munn as Mary Wilkie, Shailene Woodley as Tracy, Michael Murphy reprising his role as Yale Pollack, Mae Whitman as Emily Pollack, Erika Christensen as Jill Davis, and Jason Mantzoukas as Dennis. In keeping with the project&#x27;s focus on impermanence and spontaneity, there were no rehearsals, shows were announced only days prior, and the names of some cast members were withheld entirely; performances were not recorded.

&quot;Manhattan&quot;″s portrayal of a middle-aged man dating a teenager, which drew little criticism at the time of its release, attracted more scrutiny in the late 2010s as Allen&#x27;s reputation came into question in the wake of renewed sexual abuse allegations by his daughter Dylan Farrow.

<text>Help! is the fifth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles and the soundtrack to their film of the same name. It was released on 6 August 1965 by Parlophone. Seven of the fourteen songs, including the singles &quot;Help!&quot; and &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, appeared in the film and take up the first side of the vinyl album. The second side includes &quot;Yesterday&quot;, the most-covered song ever written. The album was met with favourable critical reviews and topped the Australian, German, British and American charts.

During the recording sessions for the album, the Beatles continued to explore the studio&#x27;s multitracking capabilities to layer their sound. &quot;Yesterday&quot; features a string quartet, the band&#x27;s first use of Baroque sensibilities, and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; includes a flute section. The North American release is a true soundtrack album, combining the first seven songs with instrumental music from the film. The omitted tracks are instead spread across the Capitol Records LPs &quot;Beatles VI&quot;, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;.

In the US, &quot;Help!&quot; marked the start of artistic recognition for the Beatles from mainstream critics, including comparisons to the European art music tradition. It was nominated in the category of Album of the Year at the 1966 Grammys Awards, marking the first time that a rock band had been recognised in this category. In 2000, it was voted 119th in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2020, it was ranked 266th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In September 2013, after the British Phonographic Industry changed its sales award rules, &quot;Help!&quot; was certified platinum for recorded sales since 1994.

== Background ==
In 1964, the Beatles appeared in their first feature film, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. Despite initial scepticism, reviews were near universal in their acclaim, elevating the Beatles&#x27; prestige as artists. With the aim of making one film a year, work began on a second Beatles picture for 1965 release. It would once again be directed by Richard Lester and produced by Walter Shenson, but written by Marc Behm and Charles Wood instead of Alun Owen. It was given the working title &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot;, one of Ringo Starr&#x27;s &quot;Ringoisms&quot;; the name stuck until early April, long enough to even appear on the US &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; single, but John Lennon and Paul McCartney presumed it would be too difficult to write a compelling song with that title, so &quot;Help!&quot; was chosen instead.

According to McCartney, most of the songwriting for &quot;Help!&quot; was done at Kenwood, Lennon&#x27;s house in Weybridge. McCartney also wrote some songs, e.g. &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Just Seen a Face&quot;, at his girlfriend Jane Asher&#x27;s family home, 57 Wimpole Street in London. At this time, the Beatles were heavily influenced by Bob Dylan, especially Lennon, who later referred to it as his &quot;Dylan period&quot;. Mark Hertsgaard writes that while Dylan&#x27;s influence was &quot;evident&quot; on &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;, &quot;Help!&quot; is where it became &quot;fully realized&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Help!&quot; is the first Beatles album on which drugs made a significant impact. Dylan in 1964 had introduced them to cannabis, which they smoked habitually while filming &quot;Help!&quot;, and they first encountered LSD in spring 1965. According to Alexis Petridis, drugs motivated the Beatles on &quot;Help!&quot; to take their songwriting to &quot;new emotional depths&quot;, such as on &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; and &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;.

== Recording and production ==

=== Recording history ===
Following their Christmas 1964 shows, the Beatles took a month&#x27;s break before beginning work on &quot;Help!&quot; All of the recording sessions took place in Studio Two of EMI Recording Studios (now Abbey Road Studios). The first set of sessions began on 15 February with &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and continued through the 20th, after which the group flew to the Bahamas to begin filming. They took with them a tape of the 11 songs recorded so that Lester and Shenson could decide which ones to use in the film.

Several songs recorded during these initial sessions were not included on the &quot;Help!&quot; album. Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Yes It Is&quot; was relegated to the B-side of the &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; single and a cover of Larry Williams&#x27; &quot;Bad Boy&quot; was put on the North American album &quot;Beatles VI&quot;. Two Lennon–McCartney compositions were rejected for release altogether. The first was &quot;If You&#x27;ve Got Trouble&quot;, originally written for Ringo Starr as his obligatory lead vocal for the album. One take was attempted on 18 February before it was abandoned. The other was &quot;That Means a Lot&quot;, a song Ian MacDonald views as &quot;an attempt by McCartney to rewrite Lennon&#x27;s &#x27;Ticket to Ride. Two versions were attempted, one on 20 February and a &quot;re-make&quot; on 30 March, but it was ultimately given to a friend of the band, singer P. J. Proby, to record. Proby&#x27;s version was released as a single and reached number 30 on the UK chart. Both &quot;If You&#x27;ve Got Trouble&quot; and take 1 of &quot;That Means a Lot&quot; were eventually released on &quot;Anthology 2&quot; in 1996, along with other outtakes from the &quot;Help!&quot; sessions. Additionally, the last song recorded in this time was &quot;Wait&quot;, which would not be released until the Beatles&#x27; next album, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.

According to Mark Lewisohn, 14 June 1965 saw &quot;[a] remarkable day&#x27;s work&quot; and showcased McCartney&#x27;s musical abilities in varying styles; the Beatles recorded his songs &quot;I&#x27;ve Just Seen a Face&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;, and &quot;Yesterday&quot;. &quot;Yesterday&quot; began with just McCartney singing and playing acoustic guitar, but he and producer George Martin decided to add a string quartet. Martin later described it as when, &quot;I started to leave my hallmark on [the Beatles&#x27;] music, when a style started to emerge which was partly of my making.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot; was released as the B-side of &quot;Help!&quot; but not included on the album.

=== Innovations and techniques ===

Lewisohn writes that 1965 introduced the part of the Beatles&#x27; career where they put less focus on live performances and took &quot;a more serious application in the recording studio.&quot; He identifies multiple new recording practices used on &quot;Help!&quot;, one being &quot;to rehearse songs with a tape machine running, spooling back to record properly over the rehearsed material.&quot; Another involved adding numerous overdubs to rhythm tracks without considering them as comprising new takes; because of this, many songs on &quot;Help!&quot; are documented as having needed only a small number of takes, yet they still required hours of work. Martin also began placing the guitar parts on different tracks than the bass and drums, accomplishing &quot;a more satisfying stereo image&quot; according to Walter Everett.

According to Hertsgaard, &quot;Help!&quot; showed &quot;a major acceleration in the Beatles&#x27; ongoing search for fresh sounds.&quot; He points out that half of the songs feature instruments the Beatles had never used before, including electric piano, flutes, a volume/tone pedal, and most famously &quot;Yesterdays strings. &quot;Help!&quot; is also the first Beatles album to feature the Epiphone Casino, first purchased by McCartney around December 1964 before quickly becoming a staple of the group&#x27;s instrumentation. Before the recording of &quot;Yesterday&quot;, the flutes on &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; were played by John Scott, only the second outside musician to appear on a Beatles track (after Andy White).

== Songs ==

=== Side one ===
The song &quot;Help!&quot; was written primarily by Lennon. He originally conceived it at a slower tempo and regretted speeding it up to make it more commercial. Although it was only written out of need for a titular song, Lennon remained extremely proud of &quot;Help!&quot; from the Beatles&#x27; break-up to his death, even once calling it his favorite Beatles song he wrote. He felt it was one of his &quot;real&quot; songs, explaining in an interview: &quot;The whole Beatle thing was just beyond comprehension. I was eating and drinking like a pig and I was fat as a pig, dissatisfied with myself ... later, I knew I was really crying out for help. So it was my fat Elvis period.&quot;

McCartney&#x27;s &quot;The Night Before&quot; is the first Beatles song to feature electric piano, played by Lennon. McCartney and George Harrison played the guitar solo together, doubling each other in octaves.

Lennon specified &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; as exemplifying his &quot;Dylan period&quot;. A connection has been suggested between the lyric and Beatles manager Brian Epstein&#x27;s homosexuality, which he kept private due to British law at the time.

&quot;I Need You&quot; was George Harrison&#x27;s first songwriting contribution since &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot; in 1963. He wrote it for his girlfriend Pattie Boyd, whom he met while filming &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. Its unusual guitar sound was achieved using a volume/tone pedal – the first time a guitar pedal was used on a Beatles song. A year after Harrison&#x27;s death in 2001, Tom Petty sang it at the Concert for George.

McCartney wrote &quot;Another Girl&quot; while holidaying at a villa in Hammamet, Tunisia. He played lead guitar on the track as Harrison was struggling with it.

&quot;You&#x27;re Going to Lose That Girl&quot; was written by Lennon and McCartney together, though McCartney credited it 60–40 to Lennon. Some have interpreted it as a continuation of &quot;She Loves You&quot; due to it revisiting the theme of a love triangle.

&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; was another song Lennon and McCartney wrote together, but they later disagreed on how much each of them contributed. Lennon said in 1980, &quot;Paul&#x27;s contribution was the way Ringo played the drums.&quot; In &quot;Many Years From Now&quot;, McCartney responded: &quot;John just didn&#x27;t take the time to explain that we sat down together and worked on that song for a three-hour songwriting session, and at the end of it we had all the words, we had the harmonies, and we had all the little bits. ... We wrote the melody together ... Because John sang it, you might have to give him 60 per cent of it.&quot;

The meaning of the phrase &quot;ticket to ride&quot; has been debated. As was rumored at the time, it was partially inspired by the town Ryde in the Isle of Wight, where McCartney&#x27;s cousin owned a pub that he and Lennon had performed at in the early 1960s. Another story goes that Lennon used &quot;ticket to ride&quot; to refer to cards given to prostitutes in Hamburg by health authorities. Lennon touted the song as &quot;one of the earliest heavy metal records made.&quot;

=== Side two ===
&quot;Act Naturally&quot;, written by Johnny Russell and first recorded by Buck Owens in 1963, was chosen by Ringo Starr to be his vocal contribution to the album. Recorded at the end of the &quot;Help!&quot; sessions, it was the last-recorded cover song the Beatles would officially release until &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; in 1970. In 1989, Owens and Starr recorded another version together.

&quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot; was originally written by Lennon under the title &quot;That&#x27;s a Nice Hat (Cap)&quot;. Five guitar layers were used on the track, including Harrison&#x27;s which was run through a Leslie speaker. Lennon was highly critical of the song in later years: &quot;That&#x27;s the one song I really hate of mine. Terrible lyric.&quot;

&quot;You Like Me Too Much&quot; began the precedent of Harrison providing two or more songs to each Beatles album. It once again features Lennon on electric piano, but also George Martin and McCartney on a Steinway grand piano.

For &quot;Tell Me What You See&quot;, McCartney drew inspiration for his lyrics from a religious verse that hung on a wall in Lennon&#x27;s childhood home. McCartney later described it as a filler song, &quot;Not awfully memorable.&quot;

McCartney wrote &quot;I&#x27;ve Just Seen a Face&quot; at the home of his girlfriend Jane Asher&#x27;s family, at 57 Wimpole Street in London. It would become one of McCartney&#x27;s favorite Beatles songs and among the only ones he would perform with his later band Wings.

The album&#x27;s penultimate track, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, came partially to McCartney in his sleep. He spent about a month playing it to people to make sure he had not plagiarised it. He then wrote working lyrics for it under the title &quot;Scrambled Eggs&quot;. &quot;Yesterday&quot; was later recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the most-covered pop song in history.

The album ends with a cover of Larry Williams&#x27; &quot;Dizzy Miss Lizzy&quot;. Lennon in particular was a fan of Williams and, along with &quot;Bad Boy&quot;, the Beatles also recorded his song &quot;Slow Down&quot;.

==Album cover==

The album cover shows the Beatles with their arms positioned to spell out a word in flag semaphore. According to cover photographer Robert Freeman, &quot;I had the idea of semaphore spelling out the letters &#x27;HELP&#x27;. But when we came to do the shot, the arrangement of the arms with those letters didn&#x27;t look good. So we decided to improvise and ended up with the best graphic positioning of the arms.&quot;

On the UK Parlophone release, the letters formed by the Beatles appear to be &quot;NUJV&quot;, whilst the slightly re-arranged US release on Capitol Records appeared to indicate the letters &quot;NVUJ&quot;, with McCartney&#x27;s left hand pointing to the Capitol logo. The Capitol LP was issued in a &quot;deluxe&quot; gatefold sleeve with several photos from the film and was priced $1 more than standard Capitol releases at the time.

==Compact disc release==
There have been four CD releases of &quot;Help!&quot;. The first was on 30 April 1987, using the 14-song UK track line-up. Having been available only as an import in the US in the past, the original 14-track UK version replaced the original US version with its release on LP and cassette as well on 21 July 1987. As with the CD release of the 1965 &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; album, the &quot;Help!&quot; CD featured a contemporary stereo digital remix of the album prepared by Martin in 1986. Martin had expressed concern to EMI over the original 1965 stereo mix, claiming it sounded &quot;very woolly, and not at all what I thought should be a good issue&quot;. Martin went back to the original four-track tapes and remixed them for stereo. One of the most notable changes is the echo added to &quot;Dizzy Miss Lizzy&quot;, something that was not evident on the original mix of the LP.

When the album was originally released on CD in Canada, pressings were imported from other countries, and used the 1987 remix. However, when the Disque Améric and Cinram plants in Canada started pressing the album, the original 1965 stereo mix was used by mistake. This was the only source for the 1965 stereo mix in its entirety until the release of the mono box set in 2009.

The 2009 remastered stereo CD was released on 9 September. It was &quot;created from the original stereo digital master tapes from Martin&#x27;s CD mixes made in 1986&quot;. The original 1965 stereo mix was included as a bonus on the mono CD contained in &quot;The Beatles in Mono&quot; boxed set.

The 1965 stereo mix was reissued again on the &quot;Help!&quot; CD contained in the Beatles collection &quot;The Japan Box&quot; released in 2014.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary reviews===
&quot;Help!&quot; was another worldwide critical success for the Beatles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halpin/LTW&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Derek Johnson of the &quot;NME&quot; said that the LP &quot;maintains the Beatles&#x27; usual high standards&quot; and was a &quot;gay, infectious romp which doesn&#x27;t let up in pace or sparkle from start to finish – with the exception of one slow track&quot;. Despite the band&#x27;s introduction of new instrumentation into their sound, particularly a string quartet on &quot;Yesterday&quot;, the reviewer also wrote of the album: &quot;It&#x27;s typical Beatles material, and offers very few surprises. But then, who wants surprises from the Beatles?&quot; While typical of the light and snappy pop music reviews at the time, according to music journalist Michael Halpin, these comments angered McCartney, who, like his bandmates, believed that artists should constantly develop through their work.

In the United States, where the mainstream press had long focused on the Beatlemania phenomenon and had derided the group&#x27;s music, as well as rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll generally, the summer of 1965 coincided with the first examples of artistic recognition for the Beatles from the country&#x27;s cultural mainstream. Among these endorsements, Richard Freed of &quot;The New York Times&quot; likened the band&#x27;s songs to works from the European art music tradition. Adding to what he described as the Beatles&#x27; impact on &quot;serious music&quot;, Freed cited musicologists and composers such as Leonard Bernstein and Abram Chasins as admirers of the group&#x27;s work. Along with several nominations for &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Help!&quot; was nominated in the category of Album of the Year at the 1966 Grammys Awards. The nomination marked the first time that a rock band had been recognised in this category.

===Retrospective assessments===

In his review of the Beatles&#x27; 1987 CD releases, for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Steve Pond remarked on the &quot;unstoppable momentum&quot; evident in the band&#x27;s pre-&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; albums and recommended &quot;Help!&quot; &quot;for the relatively quiet and understated way in which they consolidated their strengths&quot;. Writing in 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Rob Sheffield says that the US version of &quot;Help!&quot; was &quot;utterly ruined&quot; through the replacement of the Beatles songs with the soundtrack music, and that, as a result, the album remained relatively overlooked. He describes the full album as &quot;a big step forward&quot; and &quot;the first chapter in the astounding creative takeoff the Beatles were just beginning&quot;.

Mark Kemp of &quot;Paste&quot; considers it to be the equal of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and cites &quot;Help!&quot;, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and &quot;Act Naturally&quot; as highlights, along with Harrison&#x27;s return as a songwriter. Kemp identifies &quot;Yesterday&quot; as &quot;the album&#x27;s masterpiece&quot; and a song that &quot;set the stage for one of the most groundbreaking and innovative periods in The Beatles&#x27; career, not to mention pop music in general&quot;. Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; says that the album evokes &quot;a band in transition, shifting slightly uncomfortably from the pop thrills of Beatlemania to something more mature&quot;, with Lennon&#x27;s writing increasingly autobiographical and the group&#x27;s sound growing more sophisticated. McCormick concludes: &quot;&quot;Help!&quot; may not be their greatest album, but it contains some of their greatest early songs.&quot;

In 2000, &quot;Help!&quot; was voted 119th in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2006, it was recognised as one of the &quot;Most Significant Rock Albums&quot; in the &quot;Greenwood Encyclopedia of Rock History&quot;. Two years before then, Tor Milde, music critic for the Norwegian newspaper &quot;Verdens Gang&quot;, ranked it at number 20 on his list of &quot;The 100 Best Pop and Rock Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Help!&quot; number 332 on their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, raising the ranking to number 331 in the 2012 update and then number 266 in the 2020 list.

==Track listing==

== North American Capitol release==
The North American version, the band&#x27;s eighth Capitol Records album and tenth overall, includes the songs in the film plus selections from the film&#x27;s orchestral score composed and conducted by Ken Thorne, which contains one of the first uses of the Indian sitar on a rock/pop album, and its very first use on a Beatles record. &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; is the only song on the American release in Duophonic stereo (also known as &quot;fake stereo&quot;) reprocessed from the mono mix. Likewise, the mono version of the album uses a folded-down stereo mix of &quot;Help!&quot; instead of the true mono version used on the single, which features a different vocal track. &quot;Help!&quot; is available on CD as part of &quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 2&quot; box set. This CD contains both the stereo and mono fold-down versions as heard on the American LP release. A second CD release of this album, which contains the seven songs in true mono mixes, was issued in 2014 individually and as part of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot; box set.

All of the non-film tracks from side two of the Parlophone album were spread out through three American albums. Three were already issued on the previously released &quot;Beatles VI&quot;: &quot;You Like Me Too Much&quot;, &quot;Tell Me What You See&quot; and &quot;Dizzy Miss Lizzy&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve Just Seen A Face&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot; were placed on the Capitol &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, with its follow-up album &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; receiving the remaining two tracks: &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Act Naturally&quot;.

The American version of &quot;Help!&quot; reached the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart for nine weeks starting on 11 September 1965.

<doc id="74940" wikidata="Q231923" url="?curid=74940" title="Marian Anderson">
<text>Marian Anderson (February 27, 1897April 8, 1993) was an American contralto. She performed a wide range of music, from opera to spirituals. Anderson performed with renowned orchestras in major concert and recital venues throughout the United States and Europe between 1925 and 1965.

Anderson was an important figure in the struggle for African American artists to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, during the period of racial segregation, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) refused to allow Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. The incident placed Anderson in the spotlight of the international community on a level unusual for a classical musician. With the aid of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and her husband, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939, on the Lincoln Memorial steps in the capital. The event was featured in a documentary film, &quot;Marian Anderson: The Lincoln Memorial Concert&quot;. She sang before an integrated crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions.

On January 7, 1955, Anderson became the first African American singer to perform at the Metropolitan Opera. In addition, she worked as a delegate to the United Nations Human Rights Committee and as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United States Department of State, giving concerts all over the world. She participated in the civil rights movement in the 1960s, singing at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. The recipient of numerous awards and honors, Anderson was awarded the first Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, the Congressional Gold Medal in 1977, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1978, the National Medal of Arts in 1986, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1991.

==Early life and education==
Marian Anderson was born in Philadelphia on February 27, 1897, to John Berkley Anderson and Annie Delilah Rucker. Her father sold ice and coal at the Reading Terminal in downtown Philadelphia and eventually also sold liquor. Before her marriage, Anderson&#x27;s mother was briefly a student at the Virginia Seminary and College in Lynchburg, and worked as a schoolteacher in Virginia. As she did not obtain a degree, Annie Anderson was unable to teach in Philadelphia under a law that was applied only to black teachers and not white ones. She therefore earned an income caring for small children. Marian was the eldest of the three Anderson children. Her two sisters, Alyse (1899–1965) and Ethel (1902–90), also became singers. Ethel married James DePreist and their son James Anderson DePreist was a noted conductor.

Anderson&#x27;s parents were both devout Christians and the whole family was active in the Union Baptist Church, which, during her youth, stood in a building constructed by the congregation in 1889 at 709 S. 12th Street in South Philadelphia. Marian&#x27;s aunt Mary, her father&#x27;s sister, was particularly active in the church&#x27;s musical life and convinced her niece to join the junior church choir at the age of six. In that role, she got to perform solos and duets, often with her aunt. Aunt Mary took Marian to concerts at local churches, the YMCA, benefit concerts, and other community music events throughout the city. Anderson credited her aunt&#x27;s influence as the reason she pursued her singing career. Beginning as young as six, her aunt arranged for Marian to sing for local functions where she was often paid 25 or 50 cents for singing a few songs. As she got into her early teens, Marian began to make as much as four or five dollars for singing, a considerable sum for the early 20th century. At the age of 10, Marian joined the People&#x27;s Chorus of Philadelphia under the direction of singer Emma Azalia Hackley, where she was often a soloist.

When Anderson was 12, her father received a head injury while working at the Reading Terminal before Christmas 1909. Soon afterwards, her father died following heart failure. He was 37 years old. Marian and her family moved into the home of her father&#x27;s parents, Benjamin and Isabella Anderson. Her grandfather had been born a slave and was emancipated in the 1860s. He relocated to South Philadelphia, the first person in his family to do so. When Anderson moved into his home, the two became very close, but he died just a year after the family moved there.

Anderson attended Stanton Grammar School, graduating in 1912. Although her family could not pay for any music lessons or high school, Anderson continued to perform wherever she could and learn from anyone willing to teach her. Throughout her teenage years, she remained active in her church&#x27;s musical activities and was now involved heavily in the adult choir. She became a member of the Baptists&#x27; Young People&#x27;s Union and the Camp Fire Girls, which provided her with some, though limited, musical opportunities. Eventually, the People&#x27;s Chorus of Philadelphia and the pastor of her church, Reverend Wesley Parks, along with other leaders of the black community, raised the money she needed to get singing lessons with Mary Saunders Patterson and to attend South Philadelphia High School, from which she graduated in 1921.

Undaunted, Anderson pursued studies privately in her native city through the continued support of the Philadelphia black community, first with Agnes Reifsnyder, then Giuseppe Boghetti. She met Boghetti through the principal of her high school. Anderson auditioned for him by singing &quot;Deep River&quot;; he was immediately brought to tears. Boghetti scheduled a recital of English, Russian, Italian and German music at The Town Hall in New York City in April 1924; it took place in an almost empty hall and received poor reviews.

In 1923 she made two recordings, &quot;Deep River&quot; and &quot;My Way&#x27;s Cloudy&quot; for the Victor company.

==Early career==
In 1925, Anderson got her first big break at a singing competition sponsored by the New York Philharmonic. As the winner, she got to perform in concert with the orchestra on August 26, 1925, a performance that scored immediate success with both the audience and music critics. Anderson continued her studies with Frank La Forge in New York. During this time, Arthur Judson became her manager. They met through the New York Philharmonic. Over the next several years, she made a number of concert appearances in the United States, but racial prejudice prevented her career from gaining momentum. Her first performance at Carnegie Hall was in 1928.

===Rosenwald Fund===
During her fall 1929 concert schedule, Anderson sang at Orchestra Hall in Chicago, for which she received measured praise. Critic Herman Devries from the &quot;Chicago Evening American&quot; wrote, &quot;[Anderson] reached near perfection in every requirement of vocal art—the tone was of superb timbre, the phrasing of utmost refinement, the style pure, discreet, musicianly. But after this there was a letdown, and we took away the impression of a talent still unripe, but certainly a talent of potential growth.&quot; In the audience were two representatives from Julius Rosenwald&#x27;s philanthropic organization, the Rosenwald Fund. The organization&#x27;s representatives, Ray Field and George Arthur, encouraged Anderson to apply for a Rosenwald Fellowship, from which she received $1500 to study in Berlin.

===European tours===
Anderson went to Europe, where she spent a number of months studying with Sara Charles-Cahier and Geni Sadero before launching a highly successful European singing tour. In the summer of 1930, she went to Scandinavia, where she met the Finnish pianist Kosti Vehanen, who became her regular accompanist and her vocal coach for many years. She also met Jean Sibelius through Vehanen after he had heard her in a concert in Helsinki. Moved by her performance, Sibelius invited them to his home and asked his wife to bring champagne in place of the traditional coffee. Sibelius complimented Anderson on her performance; he felt that she had been able to penetrate the Nordic soul. The two struck up an immediate friendship, which further blossomed into a professional partnership, and for many years Sibelius altered and composed songs for Anderson. He created a new arrangement of the song &quot;Solitude&quot; and dedicated it to Anderson in 1939. Originally &quot;The Jewish Girl&#x27;s Song&quot; from his 1906 incidental music to &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, it later became the &quot;Solitude&quot; section of the orchestral suite derived from the incidental music.

In 1933, Anderson made her European debut in a concert at Wigmore Hall in London, where she was received enthusiastically. In the first years of the 1930s, she toured Europe, where she did not encounter the prejudices she had experienced in America. Anderson, accompanied by Vehanen, continued to tour throughout Europe during the mid-1930s. Before going back to Scandinavia, where fans had &quot;Marian fever&quot;, she performed in Russia and the major cities of Eastern Europe. She became a favorite of many conductors and composers of major European orchestras quickly. During a 1935 tour in Salzburg, the conductor Arturo Toscanini told her she had a voice &quot;heard once in a hundred years.&quot;

=== American tours ===
In 1934, impresario Sol Hurok offered Anderson a better contract than she had with Arthur Judson previously. He became her manager and persuaded her to return to America to perform. In 1935, Anderson made her second recital appearance at The Town Hall, New York City, which received highly favorable reviews from music critics. She spent the next four years touring throughout the United States and Europe. She was offered opera roles by several European houses, but Anderson declined all of them due to her lack of acting experience. She did, however, record a number of arias in the studio, which became bestsellers.

Anderson&#x27;s accomplishments as a singer did not make her immune to the Jim Crow laws in the 1930s. Although she gave approximately seventy recitals a year in the United States, Anderson was still turned away by some American hotels and restaurants. In the midst of this discrimination, Albert Einstein, a champion of racial tolerance, hosted Anderson on many occasions, the first being in 1937 when she was denied a hotel room while performing at Princeton University. Einstein&#x27;s first hosting of Anderson became the subject of a play, &quot;My Lord, What a Night&quot;, in 2021. She last stayed with him months before he died in 1955.

===1939 Lincoln Memorial concert===
In 1939, Sarah Corbin Robert, head of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) denied permission to Anderson for a concert on April 9 at DAR Constitution Hall under a white performers-only policy in effect at the time. In addition to the policy on performers, Washington, DC, was a segregated city, and Black patrons were upset that they would have to sit at the back of Constitution Hall. Furthermore, Constitution Hall did not have the segregated public bathrooms then required by DC law for such events. Other DC venues were not an option: for example, the District of Columbia Board of Education declined a request for the use of the auditorium of Central High School, a white public high school.

The next day, Charles Edward Russell, a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and chair of the DC citywide Inter-Racial Committee, held a meeting of the Marian Anderson Citizens Committee (MACC). This included the National Negro Congress, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the American Federation of Labor, and the Washington Industrial Council-CIO, church leaders and activists in the city, and numerous other organizations. MACC elected Charles Hamilton Houston as its chairman and on February 20, the group picketed the Board of Education, collected signatures on petitions, and planned a mass protest at the next board meeting.

In the ensuing furor, thousands of DAR members, including First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, resigned from the organization. Roosevelt wrote to the DAR: &quot;I am in complete disagreement with the attitude taken in refusing Constitution Hall to a great artist... You had an opportunity to lead in an enlightened way and it seems to me that your organization has failed.&quot;

African American novelist Zora Neale Hurston, however, criticized Roosevelt&#x27;s failure to condemn the simultaneous decision of the Board of Education of the District of Columbia, now the District of Columbia State Board of Education, to exclude Anderson from singing at the segregated white Central High School. Hurston declared &quot;to jump the people responsible for racial bias would be to accuse and expose the accusers themselves. The District of Columbia has no home rule; it is controlled by congressional committees, and Congress at the time was overwhelmingly Democratic. It was controlled by the very people who were screaming so loudly against the DAR. To my way of thinking, both places should have been denounced, or neither.&quot;

As the controversy grew, the American press overwhelmingly supported Anderson&#x27;s right to sing. The &quot;Philadelphia Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;A group of tottering old ladies, who don&#x27;t know the difference between patriotism and putridism, have compelled the gracious First Lady to apologize for their national rudeness.&quot; The &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; wrote, &quot;In these days of racial intolerance so crudely expressed in the Third Reich, an action such as the D.A.R.&#x27;s ban... seems all the more deplorable.&quot; With the support of Eleanor Roosevelt, President Roosevelt and Walter White, then-executive secretary of the NAACP, and Anderson&#x27;s manager, Sol Hurok, persuaded Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes to arrange an open-air concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The concert was performed on Easter Sunday, April 9. Anderson was accompanied, as usual, by Vehanen. They began the performance with a dignified and stirring rendition of &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot;. The event attracted a crowd of more than 75,000 in addition to a national radio audience of millions.

Two months later, in conjunction with the 30th NAACP conference in Richmond, Virginia, Eleanor Roosevelt gave a speech on national radio (NBC and CBS) and presented Anderson with the 1939 Spingarn Medal for distinguished achievement. In 2001, a documentary film of the concert was chosen for the National Film Registry, and in 2008, NBC radio coverage of the event was selected for the National Recording Registry.

==Mid-career==


During World War II and the Korean War, Anderson entertained troops in hospitals and at bases. In 1943, she sang at the Constitution Hall, having been invited by the DAR to perform before an integrated audience as part of a benefit for the American Red Cross. She said of the event, &quot;When I finally walked onto the stage of Constitution Hall, I felt no different than I had in other halls. There was no sense of triumph. I felt that it was a beautiful concert hall and I was very happy to sing there.&quot; In contrast, the District of Columbia Board of Education continued to bar her from using the high school auditorium in the District of Columbia.

=== Ford 50th Anniversary Show ===
On June 15, 1953, Anderson headlined &quot;The Ford 50th Anniversary Show&quot;, which was broadcast live from New York City on both NBC and CBS. Midway through the program, she sang &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot;. She returned to close the program with her rendition of the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. The program attracted an audience of 60 million viewers. Forty years after the broadcast, television critic Tom Shales recalled the broadcast as both &quot;a landmark in television&quot; and &quot;a milestone in the cultural life of the &#x27;50s&quot;.

=== The Metropolitan Opera ===
On January 7, 1955, Anderson became the first African American to sing with the Metropolitan Opera in New York. At the invitation of director Rudolf Bing, she sang the part of Ulrica in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (opposite Zinka Milanov, then Herva Nelli, as Amelia). Anderson later said about the evening, &quot;The curtain rose on the second scene and I was there on stage, mixing the witch&#x27;s brew. I trembled, and when the audience applauded and applauded before I could sing a note, I felt myself tightening into a knot.&quot; Although she never appeared with the company again, Anderson was named a permanent member of the Metropolitan Opera company. The following year, her autobiography, &quot;My Lord, What a Morning&quot;, was published, and became a bestseller.

=== Presidential inaugurations and goodwill ambassador tours ===
In 1957, she sang for President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s inauguration, and toured India and the Far East as a goodwill ambassador through the U.S. State Department and the American National Theater and Academy. She traveled in 12 weeks, giving 24 concerts. After that, President Eisenhower appointed her a delegate to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. The same year, she was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1958, she was officially designated a delegate to the United Nations, a formalization of her role as &quot;goodwill ambassadress&quot; of the U.S.

On January 20, 1961, she sang for President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inauguration, and in 1962 she performed for President Kennedy and other dignitaries in the East Room of the White House and toured Australia. She was active in supporting the civil rights movement during the 1960s. She performed benefit concerts in aid of the America-Israel Cultural Foundation, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Congress of Racial Equality. In 1963, she sang at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. That same year, she received one of the newly reinstituted Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is awarded for &quot;especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interest of the United States, World Peace or cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.&quot; She also released an album, &quot;Snoopycat: The Adventures of Marian Anderson&#x27;s Cat Snoopy&quot;, which included short stories and songs about her beloved black cat. That same year, Anderson concluded her farewell tour, after which she retired from public performance. The international tour began at Constitution Hall on Saturday October 24, 1964, and ended on April 18, 1965, at Carnegie Hall. In 1965, she christened the nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarine .

==Later life==
Although Anderson retired from singing in 1965, she continued to appear publicly. She often narrated Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot;, with her nephew James DePriest conducting. In 1976, Copland conducted a performance with the Philadelphia Orchestra at Saratoga. Her achievements were recognized with many honors, including the University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit in 1973; the United Nations Peace Prize, New York City&#x27;s Handel Medallion, and the Congressional Gold Medal, all in 1977; Kennedy Center Honors in 1978; the George Peabody Medal in 1981; the National Medal of Arts in 1986; and a Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1991. A half-ounce gold commemorative medal was embossed with her portrait by the United States Treasury Department in 1980. Four years later, she was the first person to be honored with the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award of the City of New York. She was awarded 24 honorary doctoral degrees, by Howard University, Temple University, Smith College, Saint Mary&#x27;s College and many other colleges and universities.

==Personal life==
On July 17, 1943, Anderson became the second wife of architect Orpheus H. &quot;King&quot; Fisher in Bethel, Connecticut. Fisher had asked her to marry him when they were teenagers, but she declined at that time because she feared it would have forestalled her music career. The wedding was a private ceremony performed by United Methodist pastor Rev. Jack Grenfell and was the subject of a short story titled &quot;The &#x27;Inside&#x27; Story&quot;, written by Rev. Grenfell&#x27;s wife, Dr. Clarine Coffin Grenfell, in her book &quot;Women My Husband Married, including Marian Anderson&quot;. According to Dr. Grenfell, the wedding was originally supposed to take place in the parsonage, but because of a bake sale on the lawn of the Bethel United Methodist Church, the ceremony was moved at the last minute to the Elmwood Chapel, on the site of the Elmwood Cemetery in Bethel, in order to keep the event private.

By this marriage she gained a stepson, James Fisher, from her husband&#x27;s previous marriage to Ida Gould, a white woman.

In 1940, seeking a retreat away from the public eye, Anderson and Fisher purchased a three-story Victorian farmhouse on a farm in Danbury, Connecticut, after an exhaustive search throughout New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Through the years, he built many structures on the property, including an acoustic rehearsal studio he designed for his wife. The property remained Anderson&#x27;s home for almost 50 years.

From 1943, she resided at the farm that Orpheus had named Marianna Farm. The farm was on Joe&#x27;s Hill Road, in the Mill Plain section of western Danbury. She constructed a three-bedroom ranch house as a residence, and she used a separate one-room structure as her studio. In 1996, the farm was named one of 60 sites on the Connecticut Freedom Trail. The studio was moved to downtown Danbury as the Marian Anderson studio.

As a town resident, Anderson wished to live as normally as possible, declining offers to be treated in restaurants and stores as a celebrity. She was known to visit the Danbury State Fair and sang at the city hall on the occasion of the lighting of Christmas ornaments. She gave a concert at the Danbury High School, served on the board of the Danbury Music Center, and supported the Charles Ives Center for the Arts and the Danbury Chapter of the NAACP.

In 1986, Orpheus Fisher died after 43 years of marriage. Anderson remained in residence at Marianna Farm until 1992, one year before her death. Although the property was sold to developers, various preservationists as well as the City of Danbury fought to protect Anderson&#x27;s studio. Their efforts proved successful, and the Danbury Museum and Historical Society received a grant from the state of Connecticut, relocated and restored the structure, and opened it to the public in 2004. In addition to seeing the studio, visitors can see photographs and memorabilia from milestones in Anderson&#x27;s career.

In 1992, Anderson relocated to the home of her nephew, conductor James DePreist, in Portland, Oregon. She died there on April 8, 1993, of congestive heart failure, at the age of 96. She is interred at Eden Cemetery, in Collingdale, Pennsylvania.

==Marian Anderson Award==
Anderson established the Marian Anderson Award in 1943 after she was awarded The Philadelphia Award in 1940, which included $25,000 in prize money (). Anderson used the money to establish a singing competition to help support young singers. The prize fund was exhausted in due course and disbanded in 1976. In 1990, the award was re-established and issued annually up to 2019, when the last award was granted to Kool &amp; the Gang.

In 1998, the Marian Anderson Award prize money was restructured to be given to an established artist, not necessarily a singer, who exhibits leadership in a humanitarian area.

In 2020 and 2021, ceremonies were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, the Award moved from a private operation to a program administered by Play On Philly, a classical music education organization aimed at local youth. Instead of an annual award ceremony, the funds were used to create the &quot;Marian Anderson Young Artist Program&quot;, a tuition-free program with a mission to &quot;serve those individuals whose communities have historically been excluded from the highest levels of musical excellence due to structural barriers in our country.&quot;

<text>A body cavity is any space or compartment, or potential space, in an animal body. Cavities accommodate organs and other structures; cavities as potential spaces contain fluid.

The two largest human body cavities are the ventral body cavity, and the dorsal body cavity. In the dorsal body cavity the brain and spinal cord are located.

The membranes that surround the central nervous system organs (the brain and the spinal cord, in the cranial and spinal cavities) are the three meninges. The differently lined spaces contain different types of fluid. In the meninges for example the fluid is cerebrospinal fluid; in the abdominal cavity the fluid contained in the peritoneum is a serous fluid.

In amniotes and some invertebrates the peritoneum lines their largest body cavity called the coelom.

==Mammals==
Mammalian embryos develop two body cavities: the intraembryonic coelom and the extraembryonic coelom (or chorionic cavity). The intraembryonic coelom is lined by somatic and splanchnic lateral plate mesoderm, while the extraembryonic coelom is lined by extraembryonic mesoderm. The intraembryonic coelom is the only cavity that persists in the mammal at term, which is why its name is often contracted to simply &quot;coelomic cavity&quot;. Subdividing the coelomic cavity into compartments, for example, the pericardial cavity / pericardium, where the heart develops, simplifies discussion of the anatomies of complex animals.

Cavitation in the early embryo is the process of forming the blastocoel, the fluid-filled cavity defining the blastula stage in non-mammals, or the blastocyst in mammals.

==Human body cavities==
The dorsal (posterior) cavity and the ventral (anterior) cavity are the largest body compartments.

The dorsal body cavity includes the cranial cavity, enclosed by the skull and contains the brain, and the spinal cavity, enclosed by the spine, and contains the spinal cord. 

The ventral body cavity includes the thoracic cavity, enclosed by the ribcage and contains the lungs and heart; and the abdominopelvic cavity. The abdominopelvic cavity can be divided into the abdominal cavity, enclosed by the ribcage and pelvis and contains the kidneys, ureters, stomach, intestines, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas; and the pelvic cavity, enclosed by the pelvis and contains bladder, anus and reproductive system.

=== Ventral body cavity ===
The ventral cavity has two main subdivisions: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity. The thoracic cavity is the more superior subdivision of the ventral cavity, and is enclosed by the rib cage. The thoracic cavity contains the lungs surrounded by the pleural cavity, and the heart surrounded by the pericardial cavity, located in the mediastinum. The diaphragm forms the floor of the thoracic cavity and separates it from the more inferior abdominopelvic cavity. 

The abdominopelvic cavity is the largest cavity in the body occupying the entire lower half of the trunk. Although no membrane physically divides the abdominopelvic cavity, it can be useful to distinguish between the abdominal cavity, and the pelvic cavity. The abdominal cavity occupies the entire lower half of the trunk, anterior to the spine, and houses the organs of digestion. Just under the abdominal cavity, anterior to the buttocks, is the pelvic cavity. The pelvic cavity is funnel shaped, and is located inferior and anterior to the abdominal cavity, and houses the organs of reproduction.

=== Dorsal body cavity ===

The dorsal body cavity contains the cranial cavity, and the spinal cavity.
The cranial cavity is a large, bean-shaped cavity filling most of the upper skull where the brain is located. The spinal cavity is the very narrow, thread-like cavity running from the cranial cavity down the entire length of the spinal cord.

In the dorsal cavity, the cranial cavity houses the brain, and the spinal cavity encloses the spinal cord. Just as the brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities that house them are also continuous. The brain and spinal cord are protected by the bones of the skull and vertebral column and by cerebrospinal fluid, a colorless fluid produced by the brain, which cushions the brain and spinal cord within the dorsal body cavity.

==Development==
At the end of the third week of gestation, the neural tube, which is a fold of one of the layers of the trilaminar germ disc, called the ectoderm, appears. This layer elevates and closes dorsally, while the gut tube rolls up and closes ventrally to create a &quot;tube on top of a tube&quot;. The mesoderm, which is another layer of the trilaminar germ disc, holds the tubes together and the lateral plate mesoderm, the middle layer of the germ disc, splits to form a visceral layer associated with the gut and a parietal layer, which along with the overlying ectoderm, forms the lateral body wall. The space between the visceral and parietal layers of lateral plate mesoderm is the primitive body cavity. When the lateral body wall folds, it moves ventrally and fuses at the midline. The body cavity closes, except in the region of the connecting stalk. Here, the gut tube maintains an attachment to the yolk sac. The yolk sac is a membranous sac attached to the embryo, which provides nutrients and functions as the circulatory system of the very early embryo.

The lateral body wall folds, pulling the amnion in with it so that the amnion surrounds the embryo and extends over the connecting stalk, which becomes the umbilical cord, which connects the fetus with the placenta. If the ventral body wall fails to close, ventral body wall defects can result, such as ectopia cordis, a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located outside the thorax. Another defect is gastroschisis, a congenital defect in the anterior abdominal wall through which the abdominal contents freely protrude. Another possibility is bladder exstrophy, in which part of the urinary bladder is present outside the body. In normal circumstances, the parietal mesoderm will form the parietal layer of serous membranes lining the outside (walls) of the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities. The visceral layer will form the visceral layer of the serous membranes covering the lungs, heart, and abdominal organs. These layers are continuous at the root of each organ as the organs lie in their respective cavities. The peritoneum, a serum membrane that forms the lining of the abdominal cavity, forms in the gut layers and in places mesenteries extend from the gut as double layers of peritoneum. Mesenteries provide a pathway for vessels, nerves, and lymphatics to the organs. Initially, the gut tube from the caudal end of the foregut to the end of the hindgut is suspended from the dorsal body wall by dorsal mesentery. Ventral mesentery, derived from the septum transversum, exists only in the region of the terminal part of the esophagus, the stomach, and the upper portion of the duodenum.

== Function ==
These cavities contain and protect delicate internal organs, and the ventral cavity allows for significant changes in the size and shape of the organs as they perform their functions.

Anatomical structures are often described in terms of the cavity in which they reside. The body maintains its internal organization by means of membranes, sheaths, and other structures that separate compartments.

The lungs, heart, stomach, and intestines, for example, can expand and contract without distorting other tissues or disrupting the activity of nearby organs. The ventral cavity includes the thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities and their subdivisions. The dorsal cavity includes the cranial and spinal cavities.

==Other animals==
Organisms can be also classified according to the type of body cavity they possess, such as pseudocoelomates and protostome  coelomates.

=== Coelom ===

In amniotes and some invertebrates, the coelom is the large cavity lined by mesothelium, an epithelium derived from mesoderm. Organs formed inside the coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid in the peritoneum cushions and protects them from shocks.

Arthropods and most molluscs have a reduced (but still true) coelom, the hemocoel (of an open circulatory system) and the smaller gonocoel (a cavity that contains the gonads). Their hemocoel is often derived from the blastocoel.

<doc id="74942" wikidata="Q1066873" url="?curid=74942" title="Meet Me in St. Louis">
<text>Meet Me in St. Louis is a 1944 American Christmas musical film made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Divided into a series of seasonal vignettes, starting with Summer 1903, it relates the story of a year in the life of the Smith family in St. Louis leading up to the opening of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (most commonly referred to as the World&#x27;s Fair) in the spring of 1904. The film stars Judy Garland, Margaret O&#x27;Brien, Mary Astor, Lucille Bremer, Tom Drake, Leon Ames, Marjorie Main, June Lockhart and Joan Carroll. The film was adapted by Irving Brecher and Fred F. Finklehoffe from a series of short stories by Sally Benson originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine called &quot;The Kensington Stories&quot; and later in novel form as &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;. The film was directed by Vincente Minnelli, who met Garland on the set and later married her. Tony Award-winning designer Lemuel Ayers served as the film&#x27;s art director.

Upon its release, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; was both a critical and a commercial success. It became the second-highest-grossing film of 1944, behind only &quot;Going My Way&quot;, and was also MGM&#x27;s most successful musical of the 1940s. In 1994, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

Garland debuted the standards &quot;The Trolley Song&quot;, &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot; and &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, all written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane for the film, and all of which became hits after the film was released. The film&#x27;s producer Arthur Freed also wrote and performed one of the songs.

==Plot==
The backdrop for the film is St. Louis, Missouri, in the year preceding the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition World&#x27;s Fair.

In the summer of 1903, the Smith family leads a comfortable upper-middle class life. Alonzo Smith and his wife Anna have a son, Lon Jr., and four daughters: Rose, Esther, Agnes, and Tootie. Esther, the second-oldest daughter, is in love with the boy next door, John Truett, although he does not notice her at first. Tootie rides with iceman Mr. Neely and debates whether St. Louis is the nation&#x27;s top city. Rose, the eldest daughter, hopes in vain to receive a marriage proposal from Warren Sheffield.

Esther finally meets John properly when he is a guest at the Smiths&#x27; party and hopes to meet him again on a trolley ride to the construction site of the World&#x27;s Fair.

On Halloween, Tootie and Agnes attend a bonfire. Later, after Tootie appears with a split lip and lost tooth, she claims that John tried to kill her. Esther confronts John, physically attacking and scolding him. After Esther returns, Tootie and Agnes confess the truth: John was trying to protect them from the police after a dangerous prank went wrong. Upon learning the truth, Esther apologizes to John and he kisses her.

Mr. Smith announces that he is to be sent to New York City on business and they will all move there after Christmas. The family is devastated by the news, especially Rose and Esther, whose romances, friendships and educational plans are threatened. Esther is also aghast because they will miss the World&#x27;s Fair. Although Mrs. Smith is also upset, she reconciles with her husband and they sing a tender duet at the piano.
An elegant ball takes place on Christmas Eve. John cannot take Esther because he was too late to pick up his tuxedo. Esther is relieved when her grandfather offers to take her to the ball instead. At the ball, Esther and Rose plot to ruin the evening of Warren&#x27;s date Lucille Ballard by filling her dance card with losers. They are surprised to find that Lucille is warm, friendly, and not a snob. She suggests that Warren should be with Rose, allowing her to be with Lon. Esther switches her dance card with Lucille&#x27;s and takes on the clumsy and awkward partners. After being rescued by Grandpa, Esther is overjoyed when John appears in a tuxedo and they dance for the rest of the evening. Later, John proposes to Esther and she accepts, but their future is uncertain because she must still move to New York.

Esther returns home to find Tootie waiting impatiently for Santa Claus and worrying about whether she can bring all her toys with her to New York. After Esther sings Tootie a poignant rendition of &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, an inconsolable Tootie destroys the snowmen that they must leave behind. Esther reassures Tootie that they will be together no matter where they go. Mr. Smith, who has witnessed the girls outside, begins to have second thoughts. After thinking in the living room, he summons the family downstairs and announces that they will not move to New York, much to everyone&#x27;s surprise and joy. Warren rushes into the Smith home, declares his love for Rose, and announces that they will marry at the first possible opportunity. Realizing that it is now Christmas, the Smiths celebrate.

The next spring, at the World&#x27;s Fair, the family gathers overlooking the Grand Lagoon just as thousands of lights around the grand pavilion are illuminated.

==Production==
The film is based on &quot;The Kensington Stories&quot;, a series of sentimental family stories by Sally Benson that appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1942 and later in novel form as &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;. Shortly after the publication of the stories, Arthur Freed, who had enjoyed previous success with Judy Garland in MGM musicals, convinced studio head Louis B. Mayer to purchase the film rights for $25,000, and Benson was also hired to work on the screen adaptation. The idea for the film was also inspired by &quot;Life with Father&quot;, a nostalgic family play that had been running on Broadway to great success and acclaim since 1939.

While Freed and his writers developed the script, director Vincente Minnelli, whose background was in set and costume design, prepared the film&#x27;s design. Minnelli worked with designer Lemuel Ayers on set design and with art director E. Preston Ames to capture the evocative quality of paintings by Thomas Eakins, a popular artist and illustrator at the time in which the story takes place.

A staff of six writers worked with Benson to capture the essence of her stories, including Doris Gilbert, who had worked with Benson previously. Freed hired the husband-and-wife team of Victor Heerman and Sarah Mason in mid-1942 to add an element of intrigue to the script. They introduced a blackmail plot involving Esther Smith, which Freed found inappropriate, so he tasked staff writer William Ludwig, a specialist in adolescent romance, to excise the blackmail plot and weave courtship stories into the screenplay. By February 1943, Freed was satisfied with Ludwig&#x27;s script and distributed copies around MGM and to the principal cast members. However, Garland was dissatisfied with the script, feeling its plot to be weak and her character too juvenile. Mayer agreed, and Freed brought in a pair of writers to revise Ludwig&#x27;s script who added the storyline of the family&#x27;s looming move to New York. Freed liked the changes but Garland remained unhappy with the script.

Freed&#x27;s conflict with producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Garland&#x27;s lover who was developing what would become &quot;The Pirate&quot; with Garland in mind for the lead role, nearly caused &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; to be indefinitely postponed. The situation was resolved when Mankiewicz left MGM for Fox, and Freed&#x27;s project was given the green light with a preliminary budget of $1,395,000 and plans to begin production in early October 1943. However, production was delayed because of studio problems and Technicolor Inc.&#x27;s heavy schedule, and the project finally entered production on December 7, 1943, with shooting scheduled for 58 days and a budget that had increased to $1,500,000. Nearly half of the film&#x27;s budget was devoted to sets ($497,000) and music ($234,000). Story and continuity costs exceeded $132,000 because of the numerous rewrites. Garland was paid $2,500 per week, Margaret O&#x27;Brien $250 per week and Minnelli $1,000 per week while producing the film.

Garland, unhappy with the script and unsure of herself as a leading lady, also suffered severe emotional problems, an acute addiction to amphetamines and numerous physical ailments such as recurring migraine headaches. Production reports show that she disrupted the schedule with fits of hysteria, habitual lateness and occasional absences, missing an entire week of shooting because of what she claimed to be an ear infection. Garland also balked at Minnelli&#x27;s heavy schedule of rehearsals and prerecording sessions in the months preceding filming, but Minnelli won her confidence and the two became lovers, cohabiting by the time of the film&#x27;s post-production and marrying soon after its release. Earlier in the production, Garland had a brief affair with her costar Tom Drake.

Production delays were also caused by illnesses suffered by O&#x27;Brien, Mary Astor (pneumonia) and Joan Carroll (appendicitis), but Minnelli used the delays to prepare O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s most demanding and important scenes. Severe rains and flooding in the Los Angeles region caused further delays in the production of exterior scenes. Filming began on December 1, 1943, and was completed on April 7, 1944, behind schedule and with a final budget near $1.8 million. The first rough cut exceeded two hours in length, so the writers suggested edits that brought the film down to 113 minutes for its preview screenings in the summer of 1944. MGM, encouraged by overwhelmingly positive audience previews, held the film&#x27;s release for the Christmas season.

Minnelli&#x27;s idea to introduce each season segment with a greeting-card illustration dissolving into live action was most likely influenced by a similar technique used in Orson Welles&#x27; 1942 film &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;.

Freed&#x27;s process for &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; established a pattern for Minnelli&#x27;s future musicals: budgets in excess of $1 million, preproduction schedules sometimes exceeding a full year, shooting schedules of three to six months and postproduction phases of six months or longer.

==Music==

The musical score for the film was adapted by Roger Edens, who also served as an uncredited associate producer. Georgie Stoll conducted the orchestrations of Conrad Salinger. Some of the songs in the film are from around the time of the St. Louis Exposition, and others were written for the film.
* &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis,&quot; Kerry Mills and Andrew B. Sterling, 1904.
* &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot;, Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane, 1944, performed by Judy Garland.
* &quot;Skip to My Lou&quot;, traditional, with section sung to the tunes of &quot;Kingdom Coming&quot;, &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; and &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; arranged by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane, 1944
* &quot;I Was Drunk Last Night,&quot; performed by Margaret O&#x27;Brien.
* &quot;Under the Bamboo Tree,&quot; words and music by Robert Cole and the Johnson Bros., 1902, performed by Judy Garland and Margaret O&#x27;Brien.
* &quot;Over the Banister,&quot; 19th-century melody adapted by Conrad Salinger, lyrics from the 1888 poem &quot;Over the Banisters&quot; by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, adapted by Roger Edens (1944), performed by Judy Garland.
* &quot;The Trolley Song&quot;, Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane, 1944, performed by Chorus and Judy Garland.
* &quot;You and I,&quot; Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, sung by Freed, the film&#x27;s producer, and Denny Markas (the young woman in blue on the trolley, as seen in one of the pictures below), voices dubbed for Leon Ames and Mary Astor.
* &quot;Goodbye, My Lady Love&quot;, instrumental, Joseph E. Howard, 1904.
* &quot;Little Brown Jug&quot;, instrumental, Joseph Winner, 1869.
* &quot;Down at the Old Bull and Bush,&quot; instrumental, Harry von Tilzer, 1903.
* &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot;, instrumental, Henry Bishop, 1823/1852.
* &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;, instrumental
* &quot;The First Noel&quot;, instrumental
* &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,&quot; Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane, 1944, performed by Judy Garland. The song&#x27;s lyrics were originally different. Lyricist Hugh Martin&#x27;s opening lyrics were deemed too depressing by Judy Garland, Tom Drake, and Vincente Minnelli, and Martin changed them. The lyrics originally were: &quot;Have yourself a merry little Christmas / It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past.&quot; Years after the film&#x27;s release, additional lyric changes were made for Frank Sinatra, who objected to the song&#x27;s generally downbeat tone.

===Deleted song===
Garland&#x27;s prerecording of &quot;Boys and Girls Like You and Me&quot; survives, but the cut film footage has been lost. This song was originally composed by Rodgers and Hammerstein for their Broadway musical &quot;Cinderella&quot;, but was cut prior to its opening.

==Release==
===Original theatrical run===
The premiere was held in St. Louis on November 22, 1944, and at New York&#x27;s Astor Theatre one week later. MGM held its general release for the Christmas season due to overwhelmingly positive audience previews. It became MGM&#x27;s second most profitable film after &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and solidified the studio&#x27;s reputation for high-quality musicals.

===Television===
The film aired on the &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; in December 1946, with Judy Garland and Margaret O&#x27;Brien reprising their roles. In 1959, CBS aired a television version featuring a new cast, including Jane Powell and Tab Hunter. A pilot for a TV series adaptation was filmed in 1966 but was not picked up for further production.

===Home media===
&quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; has had several home media releases over the decades, reflecting its enduring legacy in popular culture. The film was first released on VHS and LaserDisc by MGM/UA Home Video in 1989, offering improved audio and video quality of the LaserDisc release compared to VHS.

In 2004, Warner Home Video issued a two-disc DVD set to celebrate the film&#x27;s 60th anniversary. This edition featured a restored version of the film along with audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes footage, and other supplementary materials. A Blu-ray edition was released in 2011 by Warner Home Video. This release included many bonus features from the 2004 DVD. In 2023, the Warner Archive Collection introduced an updated Blu-ray version, further enhancing the picture and sound quality to modern standards.

==Reception==

Upon its 1944 release, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; was a gigantic critical and commercial success. During its initial theatrical release, it earned a then-massive $5,016,000 in the US and Canada and $1,550,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $2,359,000.

In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther called the film &quot;warm and beguiling&quot; and wrote: &quot;Let those who would savor their enjoyment of innocent family merriment with the fragrance of dried-rose petals and who would revel in girlish rhapsodies make a bee-line right down to the Astor. For there&#x27;s honey to be had inside. ... In the words of one of the gentlemen, it is a ginger-peachy show.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; called &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; &quot;one of the year&#x27;s prettiest pictures&quot; and noted: &quot;Technicolor has seldom been more affectionately used than in its registrations of the sober mahoganies and tender muslins and benign gaslights of the period. Now &amp; then, too, the film gets well beyond the charm of mere tableau for short flights in the empyrean of genuine domestic poetry. These triumphs are creditable mainly to the intensity and grace of Margaret O&#x27;Brien and to the ability of director Minnelli &amp; Co. to get the best out of her.&quot; O&#x27;Brien drew further praise from &quot;Time:&quot; &quot;[Her] song and her cakewalk done in a nightgown at a grown-up party, are entrancing acts. Her self-terrified Halloween adventures richly set against firelight, dark streets, and the rusty confabulations of fallen leaves, bring this section of the film very near the first-rate.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Wolcott Gibbs praised the film as &quot;extremely attractive&quot; and called the dialogue &quot;funny in a sense rather rare in the movies,&quot; although he felt that the film was too long.

In 2005, Richard Schickel included the film in Time.com&#x27;s list of the 100 best films, saying: &quot;It had wonderful songs [and] a sweetly unneurotic performance by Judy Garland...Despite its nostalgic charm, Minnelli infused the piece with a dreamy, occasionally surreal, darkness and it remains, for some of us, the greatest of American movie musicals.&quot; Film historian Karina Longworth also noted its fantastical and surreal elements, calling it &quot;a gothic art film in disguise as a standard Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical&quot;.

Producer Arthur Freed remarked: &quot;&quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; is my personal favorite. I got along wonderfully with Judy, but the only time we were ever on the outs was when we did this film. She didn&#x27;t want to do the picture. Even her mother came to me about it. We bumped into some trouble with some opinions – Eddie Mannix, the studio manager, thought the Halloween sequence was wrong, but it was left in. There was a song that Rodgers and Hammerstein had written, called &quot;Boys and Girls Like You and Me&quot;, that Judy did wonderfully, but it slowed up the picture and it was cut out. After the preview of the completed film, Judy came over to me and said, &#x27;Arthur, remind me not to tell you what kind of pictures to make.&#x27; [It] was the biggest grosser Metro had up to that time, except for &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;.&quot;

The film holds a 99% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 81 reviews with an average score of 8.70/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus for the film reads: &quot;A disarmingly sweet musical led by outstanding performances from Judy Garland and Margaret O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; offers a holiday treat for all ages.&quot;

==Accolades==

* In 1994, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.
* The American Film Institute ranked the film 10th on its AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals list. Two songs from the film were included in the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs list (&quot;The Trolley Song&quot; at #26 and &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; at #76).

==Adaptations==
* &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; was remade in 1959 for television, starring Tab Hunter, Jane Powell, Jeanne Crain, Patty Duke, Walter Pidgeon, Ed Wynn and Myrna Loy. It was directed by George Schaefer from the original Brecher and Finklehoffe screenplay.
* &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; was remade again for television in 1966. This was a non-musical version starring Shelley Fabares, Celeste Holm, Larry Merrill, Judy Land, Reta Shaw, Tammy Locke and Morgan Brittany. It was directed by Alan D. Courtney from a script written by Sally Benson and was intended as a pilot for a television series that failed to materialize. It was later included as a special feature on the two-disc DVD set released in 2004.
* A Broadway musical based on the film was produced in 1989, with additional songs.

==Later history==
* The late-19th century vintage carousel in the film was located at the Boblo Island Amusement Park in Amherstburg, Ontario until the park closed in September 1993. It was dismantled and sold to private collectors.
* Gerald Kaufman wrote a study of the film, with the same title, which was published by the British Film Institute in 1994.
* The Smith family&#x27;s former house at 5135 Kensington Avenue in St. Louis no longer exists. After being sold, it fell into disrepair, eventually became uninhabitable, and was demolished in 1994. The backlot house used as the exterior of the Smiths&#x27; family home later was used in the film &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; as the Gilbreths&#x27; family home.
==Source material==
The plot points for the film originate from the following of Sally Benson&#x27;s stories published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;:
* &quot;5135 Kensington: January, 1904&quot; January 31, 1942 – Tootie and Grandpa visit the fairgrounds
* &quot;5135 Kensington: February, 1904&quot; February 28, 1942 – Mr. and Mrs. Smith go out and the girls have a gay time at home
* &quot;5135 Kensington: March, 1904&quot; March 28, 1942 – The family visits the World&#x27;s Fair
* &quot;5135 Kensington: April, 1904&quot; April 11, 1942 – Not moving to New York
* &quot;5135 Kensington: May, 1904&quot; May 23, 1942 – A last look at the fair

==In popular culture==
&quot;The Trolley Song&quot; is performed regularly by performers on Main Street, U.S.A. at the Disney Parks and Resorts.

The movie is featured in the 2005 film The Family Stone. The &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Christmas&quot; scene plays on a television as the character Susannah watches and talks about how it is her favorite scene.

The film&#x27;s snowmen scene was parodied in the December 16, 2023 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, with comedians Chloe Troast and Kate McKinnon playing the characters of Esther Smith and Tootie Smith, respectively.

In the 2023 film &quot;A Haunting in Venice&quot;, characters Nicholas and Desdemona recount their days traveling with soldiers watching the first half of this film every night.

<text>Meshes of the Afternoon is a 1943 American experimental silent short film directed by and starring wife-and-husband team, Maya Deren and Alexandr Hackenschmied.

The film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1990 due to its cultural and historical significance.

The film is in the public domain in the United States because it was published in the United States between 1928 and 1977 and without a copyright notice.

==Plot==
A woman (Maya Deren) notices someone on the street as she walks back to her home. She enters her room and falls asleep in a chair. As soon as she drifts off, she experiences a dream in which she repeatedly tries to chase a mysterious hooded figure with a mirror for a face but is unable to catch it. With each failed attempt, she re-enters her house and encounters numerous household objects, including a key, a bread knife, a flower, a telephone, and a phonograph. The woman follows the hooded figure to her bedroom, where she sees the figure hide the knife under a pillow. Throughout the film, she witnesses multiple versions of herself, each representing fragments of the dream she has already experienced.

In one instance, the woman attempts to kill her sleeping body with the knife but is abruptly awakened by a man (Alexandr Hackenschmied). The man leads her to the bedroom, and she realizes that everything she saw in the dream was actually happening. She notices that the man’s posture resembles that of the hooded figure when it hid the knife under the pillow. She tries to injure him but fails.

Towards the end of the film, the man walks into the house and sees a broken mirror being dropped onto wet ground. He then finds the woman in the chair, who was previously asleep but is now dead.

The film’s narrative is circular, repeating several motifs: a flower on a long driveway, a falling key, an unlocked door, a knife in a loaf of bread, a mysterious Grim Reaper–like cloaked figure with a mirror for a face, a phone off the hook, and an ocean. Through creative editing, distinct camera angles, and slow motion, the surrealist film portrays a world in which it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish reality from illusion.

==Background and production==
The film was the product of Deren&#x27;s and Hammid&#x27;s desire to create an avant-garde personal film that dealt with complex psychology, like the surrealist films &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; (1929) and &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; (1930) by Salvador Dalí and Luis Buñuel.

Deren and Hackenschmied, who changed his name to Alexander Hammid in 1942, wrote, directed, and performed in the film. Although Deren is usually credited as its principal artistic creator, filmmaker Stan Brakhage, who knew the couple, has claimed in his book &quot;Film at Wit&#x27;s End&quot; that &quot;Meshes&quot; was in fact largely Hammid&#x27;s creation and that their marriage began to suffer when Deren received more credit. Other sources claim that Hammid&#x27;s role in the creation of &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; is mainly as cameraperson. Deren made extensive storyboards for all of her films, including camera movements and camera effects. She wrote about these techniques in professional filmmaking magazines. The ideas and execution of the film are mostly attributable to Deren. Hammid also acknowledged Deren as the sole creator of &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot;.

The original print had no score. However, a musical score influenced by classical Japanese music was added in 1959 by Deren&#x27;s third husband, Teiji Ito.

In 1990, &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, going into the registry in the second year of voting. In 2015 the BBC named the film the 40th greatest American movie ever made. In 2022, it was voted the 16th greatest film of all time in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll.

==Analysis==
In the early 1970s, J. Hoberman claimed that &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; was &quot;less related to European surrealism&quot; and more related to &quot;Hollywood wartime &quot;film noir&quot;&quot;.

Deren explained that &quot;Meshes&quot; &quot;...is concerned with the interior experiences of an individual. It does not record an event which could be witnessed by other persons. Rather, it reproduces the way in which the subconscious of an individual will develop, interpret and elaborate an apparently simple and casual incident into a critical emotional experience.&quot;

===Lewis Jacobs&#x27;s discussion===


Writing about &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot;, Lewis Jacobs credits Maya Deren with being the first film maker since the end of World War II to &quot;inject a fresh note into experimental film production&quot;.

Further in his discussion of experimental cinema in postwar America, Jacobs says the film &quot;attempted to show the way in which an apparently simple and casual occurrence develops subconsciously into a critical and emotional experience. A girl comes home one afternoon and falls asleep. In a dream she sees herself returning home, tortured by loneliness and frustration and impulsively committing suicide. The story has a double climax, in which it appears that the imagined, the dream, has become real.”

Deren uses specific cinematic devices in this film to convey deeper meaning. In a particular scene, Deren is walking up a normal set of stairs, and each time she pushes against the wall, it triggers the camera to move in that direction, almost as if the camera is part of her body. As she pulls herself up the last stair, the top of the stairs leads her to a window in her bedroom, which breaks the expectations of the viewer. In doing so, Deren destroys the normal sense of time and space. There is no longer a sense of what space she is in, nor for how long it was there. Deren constantly asks the viewer to pay attention and remember certain things by repeating the same actions over and over with only very subtle changes.

A recognizable trait of Deren&#x27;s work is her use of the subjective and objective camera. For instance, shots in &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; cut from Deren looking at an object, to Deren&#x27;s point of view, looking at herself perform the same actions that she has been making throughout the film. This conveys the meaning of Deren&#x27;s dual personality or ambivalent feelings towards the possibility of suicide. It is Lewis Jacobs&#x27;s opinion that &quot;the film is not completely successful, it skips from objectivity to subjectivity without transitions or preparation and is often confusing.&quot; An example of Jacobs&#x27;s comment would be when Deren cuts to her point of view, which normally is an objective shot, but in this POV shot she is watching herself, which is subjective. The viewer cannot expect Deren&#x27;s POV shot to contain herself.

===Joseph Brinton&#x27;s discussion===
In Joseph Brinton&#x27;s 1947 essay &quot;Subjective Camera or Subjective Audience&quot;, he states that &quot;the symbolic picturization of man’s subconscious in Maya Deren’s experimental films suggests that the subjective camera can explore subtleties hitherto unimaginable as film content. As the new technique can clearly express almost any facet of everyday human experience, its development should presage a new type of psychological film in which the camera will reveal the human mind, not superficially, but honestly in terms of image and sound.&quot;

Jacobs&#x27; critique that &quot;the film is not completely successful, it skips from objectivity to subjectivity without transitions or preparation and is often confusing&quot;, represents one point of view. However, others take the film&#x27;s approach to be a direct representation on the character&#x27;s thought patterns in a time of crisis: &quot;Such a film should indeed endow the cinema with a wholly new dimension of subjective experience, permitting the audience to see a human being both as others see him and as he sees himself.&quot;

===Museum of Modern Art===
In the Museum of Modern Art retrospective (2010), it was suggested that the pieces of the mirror falling into the ocean waves set up &quot;At Land&quot; (1944) as a direct sequel, while Deren&#x27;s last scene in the latter film (running with her hands up with a chess piece in one of them) is then echoed by a scene in &quot;Ritual in Transfigured Time&quot; (1946) with that character still running.

== Possible influences ==
=== Jean Cocteau ===
&quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; resembles Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1930 film &quot;Blood of a Poet&quot; in its representation of a subjective point of view. &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; and Cocteau&#x27;s film also share the same imagery in many instances; however, Deren repeatedly claimed to have never seen the film and denied any influence by Cocteau.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anthology Film Archives/Film Culture&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1945, Deren wrote to Victor Animatograph Corp. that she had now seen Cocteau&#x27;s film multiple times and expressed interest in publishing a commentary on it. The proposed article was never written.

=== Salvador Dali and Luis Buñuel ===
The work of Salvador Dalí and Luis Buñuel has been suggested by some critics as a possible influence. Deren reportedly detested this comparison because of the surrealist movement&#x27;s interest in the entertainment value of its subject more than its meaning.

=== Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung ===
Viewers have attempted to decode the symbolism in the film from a Freudian or Jungian point of view to uncover possible messages about identity and sexuality. Deren adamantly objected to those who saw her film as symbolic; for her, the objects in the film were just that, objects &quot;whose value and meaning is defined and confirmed by their actual function in the context of the film as a whole&quot;. Deren wanted her audiences to appreciate the art for its conscious value and spent much of her later career delivering lectures and writing essays on her film theory.

==Accolade==
&quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; won the Grand Prix International for avant-garde film at the 1947 Cannes Film Festival.

==Legacy==
A cloaked, mirror-faced figure appears in John Coney&#x27;s 1974 Sun Ra vehicle &quot;Space Is the Place.

The dreamlike (or nightmarish) atmosphere of &quot;Meshes&quot; has influenced many subsequent films, notably David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997). Wendy Haslem of the University of Melbourne&#x27;s Cinema Studies department wrote about the parallels between the two:

Maya Deren was a key figure in the development of the New American Cinema. Her influence extends to contemporary filmmakers like David Lynch, whose film &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997) pays homage to &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; in his experimentation with narration. Lynch adopts a similar spiraling narrative pattern, sets his film within an analogous location and establishes a mood of dread and paranoia, the result of constant surveillance. Both films focus on the nightmare as it is expressed in the elusive doubling of characters and in the incorporation of the “psychogenic fugue,” the evacuation and replacement of identities, something that was also central to the voodoo ritual.

Jim Emerson, the editor of RogerEbert.com, has also noted the influence of &quot;Meshes&quot; within David Lynch&#x27;s film &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2006).

In 2010, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) opened an exhibition that dealt with Deren&#x27;s influence on three experimental filmmakers, Barbara Hammer, Su Friedrich and Carolee Schneemann, as part of a year-long retrospective there on representation of women. Su Friedrich conceived her short film &quot;Cool Hands, Warm Heart&quot; (1979) in direct homage to &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot;, and used the flower and knife motifs similarly in that film.

Kristin Hersh&#x27;s song &quot;Your Ghost&quot; is inspired by the film, and the song&#x27;s music video uses several motifs from the film, including a spinning record, a telephone, and a key on a woman&#x27;s tongue. Likewise, Milla Jovovich&#x27;s video for &quot;Gentleman Who Fell&quot; reproduces other motifs such as the mirror-faced figure, the reappearing key, the knife, and the shifting staircase effect.

Industrial metal pioneers Godflesh used a still from the film for the cover of their 1994 EP &quot;Merciless&quot;, as did alternative rock band Primal Scream for their 1986 single &quot;Crystal Crescent&quot;.

Experimental electronic artist Sd Laika used samples from the film&#x27;s soundtrack for the track &quot;Meshes&quot; on his debut album.

Independent italian movie director Ener Colombo directed a remake of &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; in 2024.

<doc id="74953" wikidata="Q2276742" url="?curid=74953" title="Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>William &quot;Spike&quot; Pratt, played by James Marsters, is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt for the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;. Spike is a vampire and played various roles on the shows, including villain, anti-hero, trickster and romantic interest. For Marsters, the role as Spike began a career in science fiction television, becoming &quot;the obvious go-to guy for US cult [television].&quot; For creator Whedon, Spike is the &quot;most fully developed&quot; of his characters. The character was intended to be a brief villain, with Whedon originally adamant to not have another major &quot;romantic vampire&quot; character like Angel. Marsters says &quot;Spike was supposed to be dirty and evil, punk rock, and then dead.&quot; However, the character ended up staying through the second season, and then returning in the fourth to replace Cordelia as &quot;the character who told Buffy she was stupid and about to die.&quot;

Within the series&#x27; narrative, William was an unsuccessful aspiring poet in the Victorian era who was mocked and called &quot;William the Bloody&quot; because of his &quot;bloody awful&quot; poetry. Sired by the vampire Drusilla (Juliet Landau), William became an unusually passionate and romantic vampire, being very violent and ready to battle, but not as cruel as his companions. Alongside Drusilla, Darla (Julie Benz) and Angelus (David Boreanaz), Giles thinks William acquired the nickname Spike for his preferred method of torturing people with railroad spikes, but it is revealed it is because his poetry was &quot;so bad you could stick a railroad spike through your head.&quot; He was noted for killing two vampire Slayers; one in China in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion, the other was Nicki Wood in 1977 New York, where Spike acquired his trademark leather duster. During the second season of the series, Spike comes to Sunnydale hoping to kill a third Slayer, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), with whom he later forges an uneasy alliance. Over the course of &quot;Buffy&quot;, Spike falls in love with the Slayer, reacquires his soul to prove himself to Buffy and dies a hero in the show&#x27;s series finale. He is subsequently resurrected in the first episode of the fifth season of the spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot;.

Considered a &quot;breakout character&quot;, Spike proved immensely popular with fans of &quot;Buffy&quot;. The character appears substantially in Expanded Universe materials such as comic books and tie-in novels. Following the cancellation of &quot;Angel&quot; in 2004, Whedon considered creating a &quot;Spike&quot; film spin-off. Canonically, the character appears in issues of the comic books &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; (2007–11), &quot;&quot; (2007–09), &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine&quot;, &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; (both 2011–2013) and several &quot;Spike&quot; limited series, spinning off from both &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;. Currently the character is in the canonical comic &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eleven &quot; (2016–2017) and in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve&quot; (2018).

==Appearances==

===Television===

====Early history====
Spike&#x27;s story before he appears in Sunnydale unfolds in flashbacks scattered, out of sequence, among numerous episodes of both &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;. The first flashback occurs in &quot;Buffy&quot; season 5&#x27;s &quot;Fool for Love&quot;, and reveals William as in fact a meek, young man of aristocratic background (and an aspiring poet) who lived in London with his mother, Anne. Anne would often sing the folksong &quot;Early One Morning&quot; to her son, right up until the time he was turned into a vampire. William&#x27;s surname is given as &quot;Pratt&quot; in the non-canon comic &quot;&quot; and is written on the label of his jar of blood in the comic &quot;&quot; #002. This surname became official with the publication of the canon comic &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 11&quot; #7, in which Buffy calls him by it. The name William Pratt may allude to horror actor Boris Karloff, whose birth name was William Henry Pratt, and can also be understood as the British slang term &quot;prat&quot;, describing a person of arrogant stupidity.

Spike is one of the youngest recurring vampires on the show, though the evidence of his age is contradictory, as the concept of the character evolved over time. When he was introduced in &quot;School Hard&quot; (season 2), Giles read that he was &quot;barely 200,&quot; implying that he was either born or sired in 1797 or slightly earlier. In &quot;The Initiative&quot; (season 4) he said he was 126, thus born or sired in 1874. Flashbacks in &quot;Fool for Love&quot; (season 5) show that Spike was sired as an adult in 1880. Assuming he was in his early to mid-20s when he was sired, Spike would be in his 140s during the series. In the comic &quot;&quot; #002, Spike&#x27;s jar of blood has a label giving his assumed human birth date in 1853, about 27 years before he was sired.
In 1880, William was a struggling poet, often mocked by his peers who called him &quot;William the Bloody&quot; behind his back because his poetry was so &quot;bloody awful.&quot; The true origins of this nickname were not revealed until three years after it was first mentioned in season 2, when it was believed to have purely violent connotations. William showed a strong capacity for loyalty and devoted love, which remained after his siring. After his romantic overtures were rejected by the aristocratic Cecily, William wandered the streets despondently and bumped into Drusilla. She consoled him, drained him of blood and made him drink of her blood, thus transforming him into a vampire – &quot;siring&quot; him, in the jargon of the series. Spike&#x27;s grand-sire, Angelus, became his mentor (leading Spike occasionally to describe him loosely as his sire): &quot;Drusilla sired me, but you, you made me a monster.&quot; Whereas new vampires in the Buffyverse often delight in killing their families once they become evil, William was a notable exception. Having always been very close to his mother, he turned her into a vampire to save her from tuberculosis. But his mother, as a vampire, taunted William and insinuated he had always had a sexual fascination with her. William chose to stake her because he found he could not bear to see his mother behaving like the soulless vampire he had made of her. She, like most vampires, lacked his unusual capacity for some of the softer human emotions, like love and compassion.

After staking his mother, William began a new life with Drusilla, to whom he was utterly devoted. Euphoric with his newfound vampiric abilities, he adopted the poses and trappings of a cultural rebel, affecting a working class East London accent and embracing impulsiveness and extreme violence. He adopted the nom de guerre &quot;Spike&quot; based on his habit of torturing people with railroad spikes – possibly prompted by criticism of his poetry: &quot;I&#x27;d rather have a railroad spike through my head than listen to that awful stuff.&quot; In &quot;The Weight of the World&quot;, Spike mentions having spent &quot;the better part of a century&quot; in delinquency, suggesting criminal activities other than killing for blood. In the company of Drusilla, Angelus, and Darla, Spike terrorized Europe and Asia for almost two decades. He had a strained relationship with Drusilla&#x27;s sire Angelus, who continued a sexual relationship with her despite Spike&#x27;s strong disapproval. Although Angelus did enjoy the company of another male vampire in their travels, he found Spike&#x27;s recklessness and lust for battle to be unnecessary risks. Angelus regarded killing as an art, not a sport, and killed for the sheer act of evil; Spike did it for amusement and the rush.

In 1894, Spike and Angelus developed a rivalry with the enigmatic Immortal, who later had Spike sent to prison for tax evasion. In 1900, Spike killed Xin Rong, a Chinese Slayer while in China during the Boxer Rebellion. In 1943, he was captured by Nazis for experimentation and taken aboard a submarine, where he was briefly reunited with Angel. By the 1950s, Spike had reunited with Drusilla, and they traveled to Italy. At some point, Spike also became a rival of the famous vampire Dracula. The enmity between Spike and Dracula was explored in the comic series &quot;Spike vs. Dracula&quot;, in which their mutual hatred is caused when Spike, along with Darla and Drusilla, slaughtered the Romani (gypsy) tribe who had cursed their patriarch Angelus with a soul, although it is unclear if either Spike or Drusilla knew precisely why Darla was so angry with the tribe. That clan (unknown to Spike) was favored by Dracula, and he sought revenge for their deaths. Spike later mentions in a conversation with Riley Finn, &quot;Dracula? bugger owes me £11, for one thing,&quot; because Dracula tossed Spike&#x27;s signed copy of Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; in a fire in 1898. Spike also notes that Dracula&#x27;s fame has done more damage to vampires than any Slayer, since it made their weaknesses more widely known. Spike attended Woodstock in 1969, whereupon he accidentally became high after ingesting the blood of a hippie. He claims to have spent the six hours following the incident &quot;watching my hand move&quot;. In 1977, he fought and killed a second Slayer, Nikki Wood, aboard a subway train in New York City, taking from her a black leather duster which he wears throughout his appearances on &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; until it is destroyed in an explosion in season 5 of &quot;Angel&quot;, whereupon he gets a new one that looks exactly like the old one (&quot;The Girl in Question&quot;). At some point post-1977, Billy Idol allegedly &quot;stole&quot; Spike&#x27;s look and made it famous as his own (as revealed in season 7’s &quot;Sleeper&quot;; see &quot;Appearance&quot; below); Spike&#x27;s thoughts on this are unrecorded. Inasmuch as Buffy knew of the &quot;theft&quot; as of &quot;Sleeper,&quot; Spike presumably shared the detail with her in an undepicted moment.

Spike&#x27;s flashback appearances, in chronological order, include:

*Lies My Parents Told Me 2nd flashback: In 1880 England, William, pre-Spike, tends to his ailing mother Anne.
*Fool for Love 1st flashback / Darla 3rd flashback: In 1880, William is rejected by Cecily and sired by Drusilla, with whom he immediately falls in love.
*Lies My Parents Told Me 3rd and 4th flashbacks: In 1880, William sires his mother Anne who, as a vampire, turns against him, forcing him to destroy her.
*Destiny series of flashbacks: In 1880, Drusilla introduces William to her sire Angelus. Although the two become fast friends, they later clash when William discovers Angelus having sex with Drusilla. Angelus, informing William that when one is a vampire &quot;you can take what you want, have what you want, but nothing is yours,&quot; fights William for the first time.
* &quot;Fool for Love&quot; 2nd flashback: Months after being sired, William, now called Spike, has through acts of public mayhem forced Angelus&#x27; vampire group (himself, Spike, Drusilla, and Angelus&#x27; sire/paramour Darla) to flee London. Spike first learns of the existence of the Vampire Slayer.
*The Girl in Question 1st flashback: In 1894, Spike and Angelus are imprisoned by the mysterious Immortal, who seduces Drusilla and Darla in their absence.
*Darla 4th flashback: In 1898 Romania Spike and Drusilla, on Darla&#x27;s orders, attack the Kalderash tribe who ensouled Angelus, later called Angel. Following this incident, Angel parts company with the group and the other three vampires resume their travels without him.
* &quot;Fool for Love&quot; 3rd flashback / Darla 5th flashback: In 1900 China, Spike kills the Chinese Vampire Slayer. Angel, still ensouled, briefly reunites with the group; when Spike and Drusilla, neither of whom seem aware that Angel is ensouled, boast of Spike&#x27;s deed, Angel pretends to be impressed but is actually disgusted. Darla ultimately rejects Angel because he can no longer bring himself to kill innocents, and Angel again leaves the group. Precisely what Spike and Drusilla make of these developments between their &quot;elders&quot; is unrevealed. At some point over the next few decades, Spike and Drusilla part company with Darla, and Spike&#x27;s reputation for bloodshed and chaos eventually rivals even that of Angelus.
*Why We Fight series of flashbacks: In 1943, Spike, temporarily adventuring without Drusilla, and two other vampires are abducted by Nazi agents onto a Nazi U-Boat. Angel, working for the US government, helps Spike seize control of the sub. The two escape and then part ways. As far as is known, this is Spike and Angel&#x27;s last meeting prior to the events of &quot;School Hard&quot; in 1998. Even a century after the fact, Spike, genuinely pleased to be reunited with Angel, is initially unaware of Angel&#x27;s re-ensouled status, as he clearly invited Angel to join him in his mayhem. 
*The Girl in Question 2nd flashback: Spike and Drusilla visit Italy.
*Lies My Parents Told Me 1st flashback: In 1977 New York, Spike fights Vampire Slayer Nikki Wood while her young son Robin watches from a hiding place.
* &quot;Fool for Love&quot; 4th flashback: In 1977 New York, Spike again fights Nikki Wood, killing her. These are Spike&#x27;s last depicted activities preceding his arrival in Sunnydale, California.

====Sunnydale====

Spike first arrives in Sunnydale in season 2 of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, in the episode &quot;School Hard&quot;, accompanied by Drusilla. Spike and Dru were modeled on Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen; punk, &quot;badass&quot; vampires to contrast sharply with the more ceremonial tradition of the Master and the Order of Aurelius from season 1. Spike is in fact a fan of Sid Vicious&#x27; band The Sex Pistols and punk band The Ramones. In the final scene of the episode &quot;Lovers Walk&quot;, he can be seen singing to a cover of &quot;My Way&quot; by Gary Oldman, who portrayed Vicious in the film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;. Spike&#x27;s first act in Sunnydale is to attack Buffy and a large group of people at her school, making his first appearance the deadliest of any of &quot;Buffy&quot;″s &quot;Big Bads&quot;.He very nearly kills Buffy, but Buffy&#x27;s mother distracts Spike long enough for Buffy to recover. Throughout season 2, Spike and Dru are the canon&#x27;s most prominent example of affection between vampires, displaying the humanity and intricacies of vampire relationships. Spike was initially conceived as a disposable villain to be killed off, but proved so popular with fans that Joss Whedon decided to merely injure him instead, in the episode &quot;What&#x27;s My Line, Part Two&quot;. Spike is crushed by a collapsing pipe organ and left paralyzed. (Later, it is revealed that Spike&#x27;s injuries have healed and that he has been deceiving everyone by remaining in his wheelchair, feigning injury.)

Spike and Drusilla are major enemies of Buffy for much of the second season. They arrive shortly after Drusilla is seriously weakened by an angry mob in Prague, as recounted in the canon comic book &quot;The Problem with Vampires&quot;. Spike is a devoted caretaker to Drusilla in her weakened condition and initially hopes the Hellmouth&#x27;s energy can help restore her strength. He reunites with Angel and seems genuinely pleased to see him, but is disgusted to find that Angel has a soul (whether or not Spike in fact knew that Angel&#x27;s acquisition of a soul is why he left the group nearly a century before has never been made clear) and is in love with the current Slayer, Buffy Summers. When Angel loses his soul and rejoins Spike and Dru, Spike&#x27;s initial celebration soon turns to resentment when Angelus pursues Drusilla as a lover and taunts him. Spike decides to ally himself with Buffy against Angelus; as he explains to Buffy, in addition to wanting Drusilla back, he also wants to &quot;save the world&quot;:

Spike reappears in the season 3 episode &quot;Lovers Walk&quot;, in a drunken depression after Drusilla, offended by his alliance with Buffy, dumps him for a Chaos Demon. He kidnaps Willow and Xander, and forces Willow to conduct a love spell for him to make Drusilla love him again, even coercing Buffy and Angel to help him in exchange for the safe return of their friends. The excitement of a brawl with the Mayor&#x27;s vampires helps him see that Drusilla left him because he had begun to go soft; he resolves to win her back by torturing her until she likes him again, and tells Buffy where to find Willow and Xander. He also tells Buffy and Angel that they can never be &#x27;just friends&#x27; because of their love for one another. This insight foreshadows Spike&#x27;s later role as the &quot;truth-seer&quot; of the group.

Spike returns to Sunnydale alone in season 4, in the episode &quot;The Harsh Light of Day&quot;, briefly living with Harmony Kendall, a shallow former classmate of Buffy, now a vampire. He is in Sunnydale to look for the Gem of Amarra, a ring which makes a vampire effectively invulnerable. He finds it and attacks Buffy in daylight, but she wrests the ring from his finger and sends it to Angel. Spike goes to Los Angeles, and hires a vampire named Marcus to torture Angel in order to get the ring, but Marcus takes the ring himself and Angel finally destroys it.

After being captured by the Initiative and implanted with a cerebral microchip which punishes him with debilitating pain whenever he harms or attempts to harm any non-demon life forms (he initially assumes it works the same with anything living), Spike turns to the Scooby Gang for protection, bartering his knowledge of the Initiative. (Though he still spars with Buffy, provided he has no real intent on harming her) His inability to bite is comically compared to impotence, much to Spike&#x27;s constant humiliation; in &quot;Doomed&quot;, he attempts to commit suicide by staking himself at Xander&#x27;s house, but is stopped by Willow and Xander. Eventually, he inadvertently discovers that he can harm demons and enthusiastically joins a fight with this knowledge, showing that he&#x27;s less concerned about what side he&#x27;s fighting on than fighting for the thrill of it. Occasionally helping the Scooby Gang by providing them with information and/or combat assistance in exchange for cash or for the joy of fighting, but having no qualms about betraying them to such enemies as Faith and Adam. In season 4, Spike was introduced to fill the antagonistic role that Cordelia had in seasons 1 to 3; as Joss Whedon explains on the DVD featurette, &quot;All of our characters got to the point where they were loving and hugging, and it was sort of like, where&#x27;s Cordelia?&quot; Spike appeared in every episode thereafter with the exception of &quot;The Body&quot;.

In season 5, after some erotic dreams, Spike becomes aware to his horror that he has fallen in love with Buffy. He becomes a more active participant in the Scooby Gang, jumping into several of Buffy&#x27;s fights to provide assistance, whether she wants it or not. When Buffy rejects his advances, Spike attempts to prove his love by kidnapping her so that she can witness him killing Drusilla for her, to little avail; in her disgust, Buffy un-invites him from her house (something she had not bothered to do in almost three years since their alliance against Angelus) and alienates him from the group.

Spike then has Warren Mears make a robot in Buffy&#x27;s likeness, programmed to love and obey him. Though Buffy is disgusted by this, her hostility towards him fades considerably when she learns that Spike refused, even under intense torture, to reveal the identity of the Key to Glory, nearly laying down his life to protect Buffy&#x27;s sister Dawn. Buffy is moved by this unexpected loyalty and kisses him, saying she will not forget what he has done. In the days and hours leading up to the final showdown with Glory, Spike fights by Buffy&#x27;s side, earning her trust and a re-invitation to her house. Spike displays unabashed grief after Buffy dies in the showdown with Glory. He honors her memory by remaining loyal to the Scoobies, fighting at their side and serving the role of babysitter / older brother / protector to Dawn, helping Willow and Tara to raise her in Buffy&#x27;s absence.

After Buffy is resurrected at the beginning of season 6, she is despondent and detached from her friends. During this time, her relationship to Spike deepens and she is able to talk to him about things she feels she cannot share with the Scooby Gang. She gets drunk with Spike, and calls him &quot;a neutered vampire who cheats at kitten poker.&quot; After a demon&#x27;s spell makes them express their emotions in song, and Buffy sings &quot;I want the fire back&quot;, Buffy and Spike begin a physical relationship, consummated two episodes later. The relationship is frequently violent, with Buffy most often initiating both the violence and the sex between them; the violence is made all the easier when Spike finds that (as a side effect of Willow&#x27;s resurrection spell) his chip now does not stop him from harming Buffy. Buffy threatens to kill Spike if he ever tells anyone about their relationship. Both are unsatisfied; Buffy is ashamed of her dark desires, while Spike obsessively craves the love, trust, and affection that she is unwilling to give. In &quot;As You Were&quot;, Buffy tells Spike she is using him and ends their relationship. Believing he still has a chance with Buffy after seeing her reactions of jealousy and hurt when he has a drunk sexual encounter with Anya, Spike corners her and makes aggressive sexual advances. When she refuses him, he grows desperate and attacks her, nearly raping her in the process—though Buffy manages to kick him off long enough for him to realize what he was about to do and stop himself. Simultaneously horrified by his actions and angry with his status as somewhere between man and monster, Spike leaves Sunnydale soon after. He makes his way to a remote area of Africa, where he seeks out a legendary demon shaman and undergoes the Demon Trials, a series of gruelling physical challenges, in return for a wish. Having proven his worthiness by surviving the trials, Spike is granted his wish, which is then revealed to be to have his soul restored.

In season 7, a re-ensouled Spike must cope with the guilt of his past actions and try to win back Buffy&#x27;s trust. But under influence of the First Evil&#x27;s hypnotic trigger, Spike unknowingly starts killing again. Upon discovering what he has done, he begs Buffy to stake him, but she refuses and takes him into her house, telling him she has seen him change. Buffy guards and cares for Spike throughout his recovery, telling Spike she believes in him, a statement which later sustains him throughout his imprisonment and torture at the hands of the First. When Spike&#x27;s chip begins to malfunction, causing him intense pain and threatening to kill him, Buffy trusts him enough to order the Initiative operatives to remove it from his head. When Nikki Wood&#x27;s son Robin tries to kill Spike, he unwittingly frees Spike from his hypnotic trigger: the song &quot;Early One Morning&quot;, a favorite of his mother, which evokes Spike&#x27;s traumatic memories of his mother&#x27;s abusive behavior toward him after she turned; after Spike is able to address these issues, he realizes his mother had always loved him, knowledge which frees him from the First&#x27;s control.

Later in the season, Spike and Buffy achieve an emotional closeness; he alone stays loyal to her when the Scoobies and Potentials mutiny against her, and his words and encouragement give a depressed Buffy the strength to continue fighting. They spend three nights together, one of which Spike describes as the best night of his life, just holding her. It is unclear whether they resume their sexual intimacy during the third night; creator Joss Whedon says on the DVD commentary for &quot;Chosen&quot; that he intentionally left it to the viewers to decide how they felt the relationship progressed. In the final battle inside the Hellmouth, Spike, wearing a mystical amulet, sacrifices himself to destroy the Turok-Han and close the Hellmouth. He is slowly incinerated in the process, but not before Buffy tells him &quot;I love you.&quot; He replies, &quot;No, you don&#x27;t; but thanks for saying it.&quot; Even as he burns and crumbles to dust, Spike laughs and revels in the destruction around him and the burning presence of his soul, glad to be able to see the fight to its end. In dying to save the world, he becomes a Champion.

====Los Angeles====
Spike had previously appeared in the season 1 episode of &quot;Angel&quot; &quot;In the Dark&quot;, Spike goes to Los Angeles at the same time as Oz arrives to give Angel the Gem of Amarra, Spike&#x27;s objective was to get the ring and kill Angel. Oz gives Angel the ring who then hides it in the sewer, just as he is about to leave for another case, he is ambushed by Spike who hits him with a wooden plank, Angel defeats Spike but Spike warns him that he will get the ring one way or another. Angel takes precaution and goes on a manhunt for Spike, Angel finally finds him, chases him through the alley, and corners him only to fall into Spike&#x27;s trap. Spike captures Angel and hires a vampire named Marcus to torture Angel until he tells him where the ring is. After a while Spike gets bored with waiting so he goes to Angel&#x27;s apartment to find the ring and leaving Marcus to torture Angel, he gets to the apartment only to find Cordelia and Doyle aiming at him with weapons and demanding to know where Angel is. Spike reveals Angel&#x27;s location and tells them that the only way he will release Angel is if they find him the ring. Cordelia and Doyle find the ring in the sewer and head straight to Spike. When they arrive at the location they find out that Spike had lied about releasing Angel. Taking precautions however, they then throw the ring away and just as Spike was about to retrieve it, Oz bursts through the wall in his van and rescues Angel. Spike looks for the ring but finds out that Marcus took it. Spike begins smashing Marcus&#x27;s things and shouting about how he is going to work alone from now on until a hole that was in the ceiling lets sunlight in and sets the back of his hair on fire.

Despite his apparent death at the end of &quot;Buffy&quot; final season, Spike returns in the fifth and final season of the spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot;. Resurrected by the amulet in the Los Angeles branch of supernatural law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart, he spends seven episodes as an incorporeal being akin to a ghost; he starts to understand being one when he battles &quot;the Reaper&quot; Matthias Pavayne. During this time he realizes he is being slowly pulled into hell. Later he becomes corporeal, due to a mysterious gift that arrives at the office of Wolfram and Hart. After this, Spike takes on Angel to prove which one of them is the Champion spoken of in the Shanshu Prophecy. Spike defeats Angel, but the prophecy remains ambiguous (the Cup of Torment is revealed as a fake containing Mountain Dew). Manipulated by Lindsey McDonald into &quot;helping the helpless&quot;, Spike becomes a sort of rival to Angel; resembling the heroic Champion Angel was in earlier seasons before becoming disillusioned and corrupted by the bureaucracy of Wolfram &amp; Hart. Soon afterward he is kidnapped by the psychotic Slayer Dana, who believes he was responsible for kidnapping and torturing her as a child. Cordelia comments on this strange turn of events after coming out of her coma in &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome&quot;, exclaiming to Angel, &quot;Okay, Spike&#x27;s a hero, and you&#x27;re CEO of Hell, Incorporated. What freaking bizarro world did I wake up in?&quot;

When Fred is killed by Illyria, Spike mourns her death and decides to join Team Angel in her honor. Upon learning that Buffy is now dating The Immortal, Spike and Angel travel to Rome on the pretext of business but spend most of the time there trying to find Buffy. In the end, they fail to catch up with her. (The blonde glimpsed in Rome is later revealed to be a decoy Buffy, set up by Andrew Wells, who had researched the history between Angel, Spike and The Immortal, and thought the idea would be &quot;hilarious&quot;.) During the final episodes of &quot;Angel&quot;, Spike is the first to vote for Angel&#x27;s plan to wound the Senior Partners by massacring the Circle of the Black Thorn. He then spends what might be his last hours on Earth returning to his mortal roots as a frustrated poet, triumphantly knocking them dead (figuratively) in an open mic poetry slam at a bar. After single-handedly (literally, he held the baby in one hand and a sword in the other) rescuing an infant and destroying the Fell Brethren, Spike joins Angel, Illyria, and a badly wounded Charles Gunn in the alley behind the Hyperion as the series draws to an end, preparing to incur the apocalyptic wrath of the Senior Partners, as a way of going out in a blaze of glory that will probably cost their lives.

===Literature===
Spike appears significantly in a number of canonical Expanded Universe literature concurrent with and subsequent to the television series, including both &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; comic books. Many of these novels and comic books concern Spike&#x27;s backstory in the periods between the events shown in flashbacks in the television series. From 2007, both Dark Horse Comics and IDW Publishing began telling canonical continuations of &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, respectively. Marsters himself wrote for the miniseries &quot;Spike &amp; Dru&quot; in 2000. The collection also featured the Christopher Golden stories &quot;The Queen of Hearts&quot;, &quot;All&#x27;s Fair&quot;, &quot;Paint the Town Red&quot; and &quot;Who Made Who?&quot;, set in or around episodes of &quot;Buffy&quot; in seasons 2 and 4; &quot;Who Made Who&quot; is set during the &quot;Buffy&quot; episode &quot;Lovers Walk&quot; and depicts the disintegration of his relationship with Drusilla when they were together in Brazil. After &quot;Buffy&quot; finished in 2003, Spike appeared in a comic story from the canonical &quot;Tales of the Vampires&quot; series. Written by series writer Drew Goddard, &quot;The Problem with Vampires&quot; establishes his adventures in Prague prior to his introduction &quot;Buffy&quot; episode &quot;School Hard&quot;. Christopher Golden&#x27;s 2000 novel &quot;Spike and Dru: Pretty Maids All in a Row&quot; depicts Spike killing a Slayer named Sophie in the 1940s, contradicting the two Slayers whom Spike is later established to have killed; the second Slayer Spike killed was established as New Yorker Nikki Wood. The short story &quot;Voodoo Lounge&quot; from the collection &quot;Tales of the Slayer&quot; is a sequel to this novel. Golden&#x27;s 2006 novel, &quot;Blackout&quot;, is truer to the series&#x27; chronology by depicting Spike&#x27;s fatal encounter with Slayer Nikki Wood in 1977. Diana G. Gallagher&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;Spark and Burn&quot; depicts the struggling early-season 7 Spike remembering an account of his life, amounting to a chronological character history of Spike&#x27;s life from the 19th century to the time of the framing device.

 Most Spike-centric stories, however, have been published subsequent to &quot;Angel&quot;″s finale episode. The 2005 IDW comic book &quot;&quot;, by Peter David, depicts Spike&#x27;s encounter with the vengeance demon Halfrek, explaining his recognition of her in &quot;Buffy&quot; episode &quot;Older and Far Away&quot;, and clarifying that she was in fact his beloved Cecily. Mutant Enemy approved the story, even though IDW did not have rights to a &quot;Buffy&quot;-only character like Halfrek, because of her importance to Spike&#x27;s backstory, on the condition that the story&#x27;s timing was deliberately ambiguous. Following &quot;Angel&quot;″s cancellation, Spike immediately appeared in the &quot;Angel&quot; miniseries &quot;Spike vs. Dracula&quot; by Peter David, a sequel to the &quot;Buffy&quot; episode &quot;Buffy vs. Dracula&quot; and expanding on the characters&#x27; century-old rivalry established in that episode. Scott Tipton&#x27;s 2006 comic &quot;&quot; is detective fiction set during season 5, and also features allusions to Spike&#x27;s activities in the late 1940s. Tipton&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in 2006 is a season 5 story that acts as a sequel to the 1999 &quot;Buffy&quot;/&quot;Angel&quot; crossover episodes &quot;The Harsh Light of Day&quot; and &quot;In the Dark&quot;, featuring the immortality-bestowing Gem of Amarra in 2005 Los Angeles. Lastly, writer Brian Lynch teamed up with Franco Urru to produce the story arc &quot;&quot; (2006–07), depicting Spike&#x27;s stay in a supernatural medical facility. Although originally of the same ambiguous relationship to canon, the characters it introduced would reappear in the canonical &quot;Angel&quot; comic books to come later. Whedon appreciated Lynch&#x27;s writing of Spike in &quot;Asylum&quot; so much that he commissioned him to co-write the canonical continuation of the series, &quot;&quot;, in 2007. Lynch and Urru also penned &quot;&quot;, featuring Spike and Lorne doing battle with the muppet demons of Angel episode &quot;Smile Time&quot; in Japan. In the explicitly canonical Whedon stories of 2007, Spike and Angel first appear in a joint cameo in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; (Dark Horse) as part of Buffy&#x27;s sexual fantasies. In the Dark Horse Presents #24 &quot;Season Eight&quot; tie-in, &quot;Always Darkest&quot;, Spike and Angel appear (again in a dream sequence) at Buffy&#x27;s side when she is fighting Caleb, but to her dismay the two start flirting with and kissing one another. Spike appears in &quot;Season Eight&quot; properly at the conclusion of the &quot;Twilight&quot; story arc. Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Spike&quot; series features some collaboration with Whedon to connect the IDW and Dark Horse series&#x27; continuities. IDW had planned to launch the series as a &quot;bona fide&quot; ongoing series, and as such it establishes a support cast for Spike suited to his position headlining the title. The transfer of &quot;Angel&quot; rights from IDW to Dark Horse necessitated that it end instead as an 8-issue miniseries.

In IDW&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Spike does not appear until the second issue, written by Brian Lynch with art by Franco Urru (the creative team of &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;) with plotting and &quot;executive production&quot; by Whedon himself. In &quot;Angel: After the Fall&quot;, Spike has adjusted to Los Angeles&#x27; new status as a literal hell on Earth; he and Illyria both serve together as the Demon Lords of Beverly Hills, living in the Playboy Mansion after the death of Hugh Hefner and served by a harem of human and demon females known collectively as the &quot;Spikettes.&quot; How Spike and Illyria got to be Lords of Los Angeles is detailed in the &quot;Spike: After the Fall&quot; (2008) miniseries, which also introduces a human friend for Spike in Jeremy Johns. In their new capacity, Spike and Illyria secretly rescue humans and benevolent demons, evacuating them into the care of Connor, Nina Ash, and Gwen Raiden. Spike rallies alongside Angel against the other demon Lords. When vampire Gunn causes Illyria to revert to her monster form, memories of Fred from Spike and Wesley are transplanted into her to restore her humanity. After the Senior Partners revert time to before the Fall, Spike begins a loosely affiliated relationship with the reformed Angel Investigations company, collaborating with Angel and his associates while maintaining independence. Spike continues to appear in the ongoing &quot;Angel&quot; spin-off series by IDW, under the pens of Kelley Armstrong, Bill Willingham and others. As part of its &quot;After the Fall&quot; franchise, IDW also published Bill Williams&#x27; miniseries, &quot;Spike: The Devil You Know&quot; (2010), which follows Spike&#x27;s journey from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, where he acquires a spaceship and a crew of alien bugs after learning from Wolfram &amp; Hart of a prophecy concerning the impending apocalypse (featured in &quot;Buffy&quot;) which has driven them to abandon this dimension.

Spike&#x27;s IDW series feeds into the &quot;Twilight&quot; and &quot;Last Gleaming&quot; arcs of &quot;Buffy Season Eight&quot;, concluding that series in 2011. In &quot;Season Eight&quot;, Spike and his crew come to Buffy&#x27;s aid to help prevent the end of the universe. Due to his own research into the prophecies concerning this apocalypse, Spike is able to lead Buffy and friends to the site of the final showdown with Twilight. When Buffy&#x27;s decision sees the world lose its magic, Spike is the only one to be emphatically supportive of the decision she had to make. In the follow-up series &quot;Season Nine&quot; (2011–2013), Spike bases his ship in San Francisco to be near Buffy, but eventually leaves due to the complicatedness of their relationship, setting up the miniseries &quot;Spike: A Dark Place&quot; (2012), which follows Spike and his insectoid crew aboard his spaceship. Dark Horse also gives the &quot;Spike&quot; title a new stylised logo, distinct from the &quot;Angel&quot;-typeface logo used prior. The arc serves to divest Spike of the ship and crew, and sets up his 2013 crossover stint in &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; ahead of an eventual return to the main &quot;Buffy&quot; series. In issues of &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot;, Spike helps Angel defeat a demon in possession of Giles&#x27; soul, but leaves London where they are based without hesitation when he learns that Dawn is gravely unwell back in San Francisco. He returns to San Francisco to provide comfort to Dawn who is rapidly fading away without magic in the world to sustain her form. However, his memories of her start to quickly fade and recordings he makes of himself talking about her turn to static. Spike appears unconcerned he missed the chance to talk to Buffy who, along with Willow and Xander, has gone to find magic to save Dawn at the Deeper Well in England. When nobody can remember the name of Buffy&#x27;s sister, he phones her boyfriend Xander, and also warns him that the rogue Slayer Simone Doffler has been seeking a way to become the ultimate vampire. When the others return and Dawn is restored Buffy thanks him for staying with her sister, Spike says all that matters to him is that Dawn is safe again. Spike continues to appear in &quot;Season 10&quot;, in which he and Buffy finally resume their romantic relationship while juggling the responsibility of rewriting the new rules of magic with the rest of the Scoobies. In &quot;Season 11&quot;, he alongside Willow and Buffy, enter a demon internment camp where they uncover a government plot to drain the world&#x27;s magic. In the final fight against White House Press Secretary Johanna Wise, who spearheaded the conspiracy, he and Buffy sustain serious magical burns–though both are nearly fully recovered soon after due to augmented supernatural healing abilities. In the final issue, they tell each other they love each other and kiss.

==Characterization==

===Personality===

As a human, William&#x27;s core personality traits were passion and loyalty, though both were heavily sublimated by the conventions of Victorian England. As a product of his time, he channelled these attributes in conventional pursuits, such as nurturing an unrequited romance, an active scholarly life, and care for his ill mother. Highly creative and imaginative, William devoted considerable time to study, reflection, and literary arts, particularly romantic poetry. While his most fervent aspiration was to achieve recognition and acceptance by his peers, romantic interests, and literary community, his pervasive fear of rejection held him back from taking risks; as such, most of his contemporaries regarded him as a timid object of ridicule.

Upon becoming a vampire, his newfound romance with Drusilla, acceptance into a new peer group with Angel and Darla, mixed with the radical changes to his physiology (particularly physical strength), completely dissolved his fears in an experience he considered to be &quot;profound.&quot; The sudden erosion of his societal and emotional barriers created dramatic shifts in his attitude and behaviors, allowing him to craft an entirely new persona that was enthusiastic to the point of recklessness, fearless in confrontation, and which reveled in having the power to flout laws and traditional morality. William so embraced this lifestyle that he no longer felt his name was appropriate, instead adopting the name, &quot;Spike&quot;, as his infamy grew for torturing victims with railroad spikes; in his words, he &quot;had to die before [he] really felt alive&quot;. Spike is also rare among vampires because he does not fear Slayers; he seeks them out and has killed two by the time he arrives in Sunnydale.

Spike is a highly perceptive and emotionally intelligent vampire, which starkly contrasts his raucous &quot;devil-may-care&quot; attitude. As a soulless vampire, his core personality remained intact but less inhibited, exhibiting the capacity for passion and deep affection, loyalty, and aesthetic appreciation. Later, after securing the return of his soul, his conscience returned without his old inhibitions, leaving his love of &quot;a good brawl&quot; unapologetically intact. Similarly, Spike&#x27;s intense zest for life (a passion for art, love of life, devotion to specific people) remains consistent.

Quick wit is one of the character&#x27;s hallmarks, as Spike enjoys verbal sparring as much as physical fighting; in all his appearances, he has a habit of pithy remarks and glib insults, even toward the few he does not view as antagonists. Among his favorite targets are Angel, Xander, Giles, and (to a lesser extent) Buffy – in season 5&#x27;s episode The Gift as he and Giles are leaving to fight Glory, he wryly paraphrases Giles&#x27; quotation of Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry V &#x27;we band of brothers&#x27; speech to &#x27;we band of buggered&#x27;. Joss Whedon credits this antipathy as what convinced him in the episode &quot;Lovers Walk&quot; to bring Spike back as a cast regular. As James Marsters put it, &quot;I was supposed to be the one who stood at the side and said, &#x27;Buffy, you&#x27;re stupid, and we&#x27;re all gonna die&#x27;.&quot;

Spike often nicknames people, both as insults and as terms of endearment; for example, he calls Dawn &quot;Little Bit&quot; or &quot;the Niblet&quot;. Spike&#x27;s classical romanticism also manifests in his frequent references to poetry, songs, and literature; on occasion he even waxes poetic on the nature of love, life, and unlife as being driven by blood, reasoning that blood is more powerful than any supernatural force because it is what separates the living from the dead.

Frequently, the power of Spike&#x27;s passions override his physical limitations. His pain tolerance, in particular, is exceptionally high due to his willingness to disregard physical discomfort in favor of his goals, interpersonal attachments, and general defiance of any limitation. Notably, when Glory tortures him to reveal the identity of the Key, he defies and insults her at every opportunity; privately, he later reveals in confidence that he would rather die than see Buffy hurt. In terms of his defiant nature, he often treats his vulnerability to the sun as simply an annoying inconvenience. He drives in broad daylight in vehicles with blacked-out windows (often listening to Punk Rock while he does so), and on several occasions travels outside during the day using only a blanket for cover.

Since becoming a vampire, Spike&#x27;s core personality trait of loyalty has occasionally been at odds with his resentment of being controlled. While he prefers to see himself as a rebel against any kind of authority, he recognizes that his devotion has allowed others to manipulate him and, at times, for him to put self-imposed limits on himself for the sake of others. In an extreme example, Angel was able to manipulate Spike&#x27;s allegiance based on his attachment to Drusilla; in a less extreme example, he often modifies his crass tendencies around Dawn to keep from disappointing Buffy, though he ceases when she is not around.

Like many characters in the series, Spike has battled depression at times; however, this was less a tendency towards self-pity or a psychological character trait than a reaction to new limitations. After being &#x27;chipped&#x27; by the Initiative, Spike&#x27;s inability to act out violence put him at odds with his desire to resist control and authority, and he became sullen when the pain inflicted by the chip was simply too powerful to resist. Upon realizing that he could still battle (and kill) demons and other supernatural creatures, his confidence immediately returned. Later, Spike&#x27;s greatest internal conflict arose due to simultaneously wanting to kill the Slayer (Buffy) due to her authority and position as the &quot;one thing&quot; that vampires fear, until discovering that he was sexually and romantically attracted to Buffy as a person. Recognizing that his affection for her gave her power over him caused him a great deal of self-doubt; seeing no other means to reconcile the dissonance, he chose instead to &#x27;rebel&#x27; against his vampire nature itself, and eventually seek to be re-ensouled and purify his passions.

===Appearance===
Spike has a punk look which strongly resembles English rock musician Billy Idol; humorously, Buffy claims that Billy Idol in fact &quot;stole&quot; his look from Spike. His hair is peroxide blond for the duration of his time on &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, although in flashbacks it can be seen in its natural medium brown state as well as dyed black. His nails are often painted black.

A Y-shaped scar on Marsters&#x27;s left eyebrow, received during a mugging, was worked into the show; make-up artist Todd McIntosh decided to shave out his eyebrow in order to make it more prominent. He also included the scar on Spike&#x27;s &quot;vamp face&quot; prosthesis, albeit slightly altered as though the skin has stretched. In Spike&#x27;s first appearances the wound still looks fresh, but it gradually fades until, in &quot;Angel&quot; season 5, it is barely visible. A flashback in &quot;Fool for Love&quot; reveals that Spike received the scar from the sword of the first Slayer he killed in 1900.

Spike usually wears long black leather coats, including one that he took from a Nazi officer and another that he took as a trophy from Nikki Wood, the second Slayer he killed. He wore the Slayer&#x27;s black duster for over twenty-five years. When the coat was destroyed by a bomb from the Immortal in Italy, Spike heartbrokenly declared it to be irreplaceable; but the Italian branch of Wolfram &amp; Hart quickly supplied him with a whole wardrobe of new ones, nearly identical, which he happily began wearing. His trademark look includes the leather duster, a black T-shirt or v-neck shirt and black denim pants, usually with heavy boots or Doc Martens. He also wore a red long-sleeved shirt fairly often, particularly during the earlier seasons of &quot;Buffy&quot;, and a bright blue shirt early in Season 6 &amp; 7. He explained that the shirt was supposed to show Buffy that he had changed and give him confidence (because the First was messing with his head and he did not want Buffy to think he was still evil or crazy). But later, he returned to his trademark look, commenting that he was back.

==Powers and abilities==
In addition to possessing the common powers and weaknesses of vampires, Spike&#x27;s age and experience makes him a highly effective, skilled, and versatile fighter in both armed and unarmed combat. For example, he is able to briefly overcome Illyria during a testing of her abilities prior to her powers being greatly reduced by Wesley. Illyria criticizes his (and others&#x27;) ability to adapt, calling it &quot;compromise.&quot; He is able to withstand excessive amounts of pain for extended periods of time, particularly when properly motivated, as seen in the episodes &quot;Intervention&quot; and &quot;Showtime&quot;. While not as skilled or as sadistic as Angelus, Spike also proves himself to be effective at torture, noting he had gained &quot;screams, various fluids, and a name&quot; from Doctor Sparrow. Much like Angel, he is highly proficient in various forms of martial arts, and his typical fighting style blends karate, kung fu, and others.

Spike often displays insight and skills in perception and observation, especially with regard to relationships and personalities, so long as the relationship in question does not concern him personally. This ability allows him to wield powerful psychological weapons as easily and effectively as physical ones. For example, when he wants to create disharmony among the Scoobies, Spike divides-and-conquers with &quot;The Yoko Factor&quot;, exploiting tensions that exist under the surface to alienate Buffy and her friends against each other. Spike&#x27;s skills of analysis allowed him to realize Willow was barely holding it together after Oz&#x27;s departure even though Giles and Buffy thought she was doing better, to be the first to see through Tara&#x27;s abusive and controlling family, forced Buffy and Angel to admit that they were more than &quot;just friends&quot; and identify when and why some relationships, such as between Buffy and Riley, are not meant to last, masterfully feeding Riley&#x27;s insecurities in an effort to sabotage his relationship with Buffy, so Spike can pursue her. He also predicted that Willow would go fighting against Glory after what she did to Tara even though Buffy believed that she had talked Willow out of the suicidal attempt because he would do so if Glory hurt the people he loved.

His analytical skills and intuitive insight also help him in battle from time to time, helping him to defeat, or hold his own against, very formidable adversaries. For example, he explains to Buffy he was able to defeat two Slayers because he sensed and exploited their secret desires to be free of their burden. In &quot;Time Bomb&quot;, he identifies Illyria&#x27;s fighting style as a Tae Kwon Do/Brazilian Capoeira / Ninjitsu hybrid.

While many vampires cling to the mannerisms and speech patterns prevalent at the time they were sired, Spike has been shown to easily adjust to changing fashions and styles over the decades and displays an impressive knowledge of both British and American popular culture, demonstrating another aspect of his potential for analysis and adaptability.

Although capable of developing sound battle strategies, Spike (particularly in the days before receiving his chip and being re-ensouled) often loses patience with anything more complicated than outright attack.
He is also impatient to fight the Slayer upon his initial arrival in Sunnydale; the attack is supposed to coincide with the Night of St. Vigeous (when a vampire&#x27;s natural abilities are enhanced), but he &quot;couldn&#x27;t wait&quot; to go after the Slayer and recklessly leads a mass assault against Buffy at Sunnydale High, which fails and results in the deaths of many Aurelian vampires. However, Spike did exercise patience throughout the latter half of season 2 of &quot;Buffy&quot;, when he used a wheelchair for several months after a brutal battle with the Scoobies in the episode &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; left him paraplegic. Feigning weakness, he endured torturous weeks watching Angelus sexually pursue Dru as he waited for the right time to strike against his enemy.

Spike&#x27;s &quot;vampire constitution&quot; provides him with an extremely high tolerance for alcohol (which he regularly consumes in copious quantities). His experience in crime gives him skill at picking locks, hotwiring cars and picking pockets. He is also capable of easily operating various vehicles, such as various cars, a Honda CB400T motorcycle (&quot;Bargaining part 2&quot;), and a Winnebago (&quot;Spiral&quot;). He has also been shown using video game systems and a computer, treating injuries, and playing poker and pool. Spike is also seen speaking/understanding Latin, Luganda (a language of Uganda, where he meets the demon shaman), and the language of Fyarl demons, two of whom he once employed as muscle during his pre-Sunnydale days. He is also shown to be capable of recognizing literature; in the last episode of season 5, he paraphrases a line from the St. Crispin&#x27;s Day Speech while in conversation with Giles after Buffy tells them her plan of attack on Glory.

When Spike was transformed into a ghost-like intangible state following the destruction of Sunnydale and the Hellmouth and his subsequent materialization at Wolfram &amp; Hart, he was capable of walking through solid objects. He was initially unable to make contact with objects around him until he learned how to focus his abilities through desire, allowing him to make brief contact with people and things if he concentrated enough. This ability was relatively useless in a fight; he was unable to pick up a wooden bar to hit the demon Tezcatcatl in &quot;The Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinco&quot;, and required a few moments to properly punch a cyborg strangling Gunn in &quot;Lineage&quot;. Naturally, he lost these capabilities when he was recorporealized by Lindsey.

==Unproduced spin-off movie==
In 2004, Joss Whedon set plans for a &quot;Spike&quot; movie. The film, if ever greenlit, would star James Marsters, Alyson Hannigan and Amy Acker. At a 2006 convention, Acker stated the film was not going ahead due to money issues.

==Reception==
In 1999, Spike won a TV Guide Award for &quot;Scariest Villain.&quot;

For his role of Spike, James Marsters won Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor in a TV Series in 2000 and 2003, and was nominated for the award in 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2004.

Spike is also featured in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Most Powerful Vampires&quot; list along with Angel.

Spike was ranked #2 out of 177 on &quot;BuzzFeed&quot;″s list of &quot;117 Buffyverse Characters, Ranked From Worst To Best.

Spike was placed first in &quot;SFX&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Vampires&quot; on television and movies list. The same list featured rival Angel in the third place. Spike was described as an &quot;antihero in the true sense of the word, Spike is morally ambiguous and ready to fight pretty much anyone, for fun. But underneath it all, he loves deeply and earnestly in a way that remains achingly human. Although, ironically, his personality remains pretty much the same, whether he has a soul or not — in stark (and more entertaining) contrast to Angel.&quot; Other Buffyverse vampires to appear on the list included Drusilla (at 10th place), Darla (at 25th place), Vampire Willow (at 32nd place), Harmony Kendall (at 31st place), and the Master (at 39th place).

In 2017, Spike made the list of &quot;25 Villains We Love to Hate from the last 25 years&quot; for the 25th anniversary of Syfy.

TVLine ranked Spike as 6th on their Best TV Vampires of All Time list in 2020. He shares the list with fellow Buffyverse characters Drusilla (at 19th place), Darla (at 18th place), and Angel (at 1st place).

In 2021, when discussing accusations of workplace harassment by Whedon, Marsters said that Whedon intended for Spike to be killed off from &quot;Buffy&quot; because &quot;in Joss&#x27;s world evil is not cool&quot; and the show already had &quot;a sexy vampire&quot; in Angel. Because of the positive audience reaction, the network insisted that Spike survive. Marsters said, &quot;I was basically ruining [Joss&#x27;s] show,&quot; changing it from parables about teenage adolescence to one in which &quot;those problems are kind of sexy.&quot;

Marsters recalled that the &quot;Buffy&quot; audience loved Spike and demanded more of the character. That annoyed Whedon so much that he pushed Marsters against a wall and told him, &quot;I don&#x27;t care how popular you are, okay? You are dead, you are dead, you are dead, you got me?&quot; Marsters believed that Whedon was not joking about killing off his character and said that he would not disagree with the veracity of his &quot;Buffy&quot; castmates&#x27; harassment allegations. He cited another incident in which Marsters told Whedon, &quot;It must be wonderful to wind up this universe and watch it play out.&quot; Whedon responded, &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s great, James, except I have to keep winding!&quot; Marsters described both conversations as examples of Whedon&#x27;s intensity toward the cast, caused by the great pressure the show creator put on himself.

In 2022, &quot;British GQ&quot; placed Spike in 11th place on their &quot;Pop culture&#x27;s best vampires&quot; list. He is the only vampire from the Buffyverse to be featured. That same year, &quot;Syfy&quot; placed Spike on their list of their &quot;fanged favorites from television and film.&quot;

In a 2023 interview, James Marsters said he would&#x27;ve killed off his character in &quot;a heartbeat&quot; if he was in charge of the series after he noticed that Spike was changing the fan perspective toward the vampires on the show. The original idea for &quot;Buffy&quot; was that vampires were just metaphors for the challenges of high school or the challenges of life,&quot; he explained. &quot;They were designed to be overcome; they were designed to die. &quot;Buffy&quot; is not an Anne Rice kind of thing, where you&#x27;re supposed to feel for the vampires. It&#x27;s why we&#x27;re hideously ugly when we bite someone. They did not want that to be a sensual kind of thing. It was supposed to be horrific.&quot; Because of this, Marsters said, the decision to keep weaving Spike into the show&#x27;s longterm arc was &quot;a weird fit.&quot; He admitted that he thought &quot;they never really knew what to do&quot; with his character, who quickly became a fan favorite, or how he should be part of the larger storyline.&quot; Every season, the writers would come to him and admit not knowing what to do with the character, but were eventually &quot;able to figure something out&quot; for Spike to do each episode.

&quot;MovieWeb&quot; placed Spike in 1st place on their 25 All-Time Best Vampires in Movie and TV History list in 2023.

In the summer of 2024, &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; listed Spike as 10th place on their 25 Strongest Vampires list. Angel is also featured on the list at 15th place.

<doc id="74956" wikidata="Q2589831" url="?curid=74956" title="The Miracle of Morgan's Creek">
<text>The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek is a 1944 American screwball comedy film written and directed by Preston Sturges, starring Eddie Bracken and Betty Hutton, and featuring Diana Lynn, William Demarest and Porter Hall. Brian Donlevy and Akim Tamiroff reprise their roles from Sturges&#x27; 1940 film &quot;The Great McGinty&quot;. Set against the backdrop of World War II-era America, its plot follows a wayward young woman who, after attending a party with soldiers in her small town, awakens to find herself married and pregnant, with no memory of her new suitor&#x27;s identity.

Sturges began developing the idea for the film in the late 1930s, and wrote both Hutton&#x27;s and Demarest&#x27;s roles with the actors in mind. Principal photography took place between late 1942 and early 1943. Early into production, the film was met by considerable objections from the Hays Office for its candid depiction of an unwed pregnant mother, as well as for its representation of American soldiers, which the United States War Department felt may be potentially unflattering.

The film&#x27;s narrative structure is shaped around the titular &quot;miracle&quot;—the lead character&#x27;s birth of sextuplets—being revealed at the end of the film, and Paramount Pictures promoted it with the suggestion that audiences and the press avoid revealing its surprise ending.

Released in January 1944, &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; was met by critical praise at the time of its release, and continues to receive generally positive reception in modern reviews. It was nominated for a 1945 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 2001, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; The film ranks #54 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs list of the top 100 funniest films in history.

==Plot==
Trudy Kockenlocker is the daughter of the town constable of Morgan&#x27;s Creek. Against her father&#x27;s orders, she attends a wild farewell party for a group of soldiers at which she hits her head on a chandelier while dancing. The next morning, Trudy is in a daze and slowly begins to recall the previous night&#x27;s events. She had married a soldier but cannot remember his name, except that &quot;it had a &quot;z&quot; in it. Like Ratzkywatzky...or was it Zitzkywitzky?&quot; She believes that she and the groom had used fake names, so she doesn&#x27;t know how to get in touch with him and cannot remember what he looks like. She also does not have the marriage license.

Trudy learns that she became pregnant that night as well. Norval Jones, a local 4-F boy who has been in love with Trudy for years, steps in to help out, but Trudy&#x27;s overprotective father becomes involved and complicates matters. Norval and Trudy devise a plan: they will get married secretly under false names, which will provide her a marriage certificate with the fake name of Ratzkywatzky and help her avoid a scandal. Later, Trudy will get a divorce, and she and Norval will get married legitimately.

At the rushed wedding ceremony, in which Norval wears an antique WW1 “doughboy” uniform, a frazzled Norval mistakenly signs his real name and the minister calls the police. Norval is brought to the Kockenlocker house where military, state and federal officers fight with Constable Kockenlocker over jurisdiction. Norval is accused of abducting Trudy, impersonating a soldier, impairing the morals of a minor, resisting arrest and perjury. Trudy&#x27;s father arrests Norval and locks him in the town jail after the justice of the peace rips up the fake marriage certificate. Trudy then tells her father the truth about the marriage, her pregnancy and Norval&#x27;s attempt to pose as her groom. Her father agrees to let Norval escape so that he can find Trudy&#x27;s real husband.

Needing money to begin his quest but with the bank where he works closed for the night, Norval sneaks into the bank with the constable&#x27;s assistance to take $900 while leaving his bonds there that are worth the same amount. Trying to open a safe, Norval trips the burglar alarm, so Trudy and her sister Emmy tie up their father at the police station to make it look as if he had been incapacitated by a burglar. After months in hiding, Norval appears at his attorney&#x27;s office, where he learns that the constable was fired after his ruse was not believed and that the Kockenlockers have moved out of town. Norval&#x27;s attorney urges him to disappear, but Norval is determined to find Trudy. However, he is spotted in town by the bank manager, who alerts the police.

Near the end of her pregnancy at Christmastime, the constable approaches the city council to tell them that Trudy wants to tell the real story and exonerate Norval. But before she can do so, Trudy goes into labor and is rushed to the hospital, where she gives birth to sextuplets, all boys. After receiving the news, Governor McGinty and The Boss demand that Norval be set free, with the charges dropped. Trudy&#x27;s first marriage is annulled and Trudy and Norval are declared to be married after all. The governor even gives Norval a retroactive commission in the state guard, entitling him to legally wear a uniform, and Trudy&#x27;s father is named police chief.

When Norval discovers that Trudy has given birth to six boys, he is overwhelmed, and the film ends with this epilogue on a title card:

==Cast==
==Analysis==
Sturges biographer Diane Jacobs identifies unconventional family life as the core theme of &quot;The Miracle at Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot;, citing that the families portrayed in the film parallel Sturges&#x27;s own family.

==Production==
===Screenplay===
Sturges developed the idea for &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; in the late-1930s: The original story revolved around his heroine, Trudy Kockenlocker, a woman who becomes pregnant by a wealthy banker&#x27;s son who refuses to marry her, leading her to being cared for by a hermit before she gives birth to sextuplets. The story eventually was reshaped into something &quot;far less sentimental&quot;, featuring the character of Trudy becoming pregnant by a soldier, with the character of Norval, her friend, pursuing her.

Describing the screenplay, Sturges biographer Diane Jacobs notes that the film features small-town characters who &quot;are as diverse and scrappy as city folk. And though perpetually thrown together, they certainly do not blend. Nor do they easily inhabit their landscape.&quot; Unlike Sturges&#x27;s previous screenplays, &quot;Easy Living&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; (1941), which blend elements of farce and comedy, Jacobs notes that &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; instead combines farce and melodrama, &quot;maximizing the pain and violence inherent in both forms.&quot;

===Casting===
While Sturges was completing &quot;The Great Moment&quot; (1944), he pitched the idea for the film intending to cast Betty Hutton and Harry Carey in the lead roles as Trudy and Norval. Hutton was cast in the lead role of Trudy, while Eddie Bracken was cast as Norval. The role of Papa Kockenlocker was written with William Demarest in mind, while Sturges chose to cast pianist Diana Lynn as Trudy&#x27;s sister.

===Filming===
Principal photography took place between October 21 to December 23, 1942, with additional scenes shot on February 25, 1943. Outdoor scenes were shot at the Paramount Ranch in Agoura, California. Sturges was reported to have been &quot;moody&quot; on the set, partly attributed to the pressure he had received from the production code over the film&#x27;s controversial content. Bracken stated that he and Sturges &quot;never had any real problems&quot; on set, but did note that the director was often harshly critical of the actors, which Bracken felt was a method Sturges employed to help &quot;deepen the performances.&quot;

Despite Paramount&#x27;s wishes to maintain a tight shooting schedule, Sturges was liberal with his use of film stock, sometimes shooting sequences up to fifty times, inflating the production budget against the studio&#x27;s wishes. Executive Buddy DeSylva expressed anger over Sturges&#x27; shooting methods, stating in a letter to Sturges:

===Censorship===
Problems arose with Hays Office censors early into the film&#x27;s production because of its subject matter, particularly its candid representation of an unwed pregnant woman. In October 1942, after a story conference, the office sent Paramount a seven-page letter outlining their concerns, including those about lines spoken by the 14-year-old character Emmy and the Trudy character having been drunk and then pregnant. The office wanted the filmmakers to be &quot;extremely careful in handling a subject of this kind because of the delicate nature of the high point of the story,&quot; and to refrain from reiterating the basic facts of the story after they have been presented. In December 1942, they also warned about making any metaphorical comparisons between Trudy&#x27;s situation and the virgin birth of Jesus.

Additional concerns were raised about the portrayal of American soldiers&#x27; as rowdy and lacking &quot;proper conduct.&quot; In a February 1943 letter by the United States War Department, they urged the filmmakers to ensure that the scene in which the soldiers depart for their deployment &quot;should result in giving the audience the feeling that these boys are normal, thoroughly fit American soldiers who have had an evening of clean fun.&quot;

There were so many objections raised from the censors that Sturges began production with only 10 approved script pages.

Sturges&#x27; intent was to &quot;show what happens to young girls who disregard their parents&#x27; advice and who confuse patriotism with promiscuity,&quot; and had included in his script a sermon for the pastor to deliver, expressing Sturges&#x27; opinions, but the scene was cut by the studio because the pastor was depicted in too comic a manner.

==Music==
In addition to the music score by Charles Bradshaw and Leo Shuken, two songs appear in the film:

*&quot;The Bell in the Bay&quot; – music and lyrics by Preston Sturges
*&quot;Sleepy Summer Days&quot; – music by Ted Snyder, lyrics by Sturges

==Release==
Although shot in 1942 and early 1943, &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; was withheld from distribution until early 1944, because Paramount had a backlog of unreleased films, including Sturges&#x27; &quot;The Great Moment&quot;. In September 1942, Paramount sold a number of films, such as &quot;I Married a Witch&quot;, to United Artists, which needed to keep its distribution pipeline filled, but Paramount held on to &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; because it was directed by Sturges, waiting for an opportunity to release it.

===Box office===
The film premiered at New York&#x27;s Paramount Theatre on January 19, 1944. To promote the film, Paramount aired a 20-minute preview on the some 400 television sets then in use in New York City on March 21, 1944, with stills from the film, narration by Eddie Bracken and an interview with Diana Lynn. Paramount asked reviewers not to reveal the ending to avoid spoiling it for those who had not yet seen the film. It is believed that Sturges also withheld the ending from the Hays Office.

Although the Hays Office received many letters of protest because of its subject matter, the film was Paramount&#x27;s highest-grossing film of 1944, taking in $9 million in box-office receipts while playing to standing-room-only audiences in some theaters.

&quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; is one of the few Paramount sound films produced before 1950 that still belong to Paramount Pictures and not EMKA, Ltd./NBCUniversal, along with &quot;Bride of Vengeance&quot;, &quot;My Friend Irma&quot;, &quot;Rope of Sand&quot;, &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot;, and &quot;The Buccaneer&quot;.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; received overwhelmingly favorable reviews from critics upon release. Bosley Crowther wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;a more audacious picture—a more delightfully irreverent one—than this new lot of nonsense at the Paramount has never come slithering madly down the path. Mr. Sturges ... has hauled off this time and tossed a satire which is more cheeky than all the rest...It&#x27;s hard to imagine how he ever got away with such a thing, how he ever persuaded the Hays boys that he wasn&#x27;t trying to undermine all morals...Maybe the humor is forced a little, and it may be slightly difficult at times to understand precisely what in heck is going on. But that doesn&#x27;t make any difference. At those times, you can catch your breath.&quot;

Writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, reviewer Edwin Schallert wrote: &quot;It is a feature that is intensely, even stridently, a departure from the normal Hollywood output...you can have all the fun you wish out of this picture if you won&#x27;t try to take it too seriously at any time. It belongs essentially to the screwball comedy school, and goes to most outlandish lengths in its climax, which has the misfortune to show up the whole thing.&quot;

Critic James Agee noted that &quot;the Hays office has either been hypnotized into a liberality for which it should be thanked, or has been raped in its sleep&quot; to allow the film to be released. In a second review, Agee described the film as &quot;a little like taking a nun on a roller coaster.&quot;

U.S. Military General Dwight D. Eisenhower was an outspoken fan of the film.

====Contemporary====
Reviews from review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes indicate an 87% approval rate with an average of 8.2/10 based on 30 reviews. Its critics&#x27; consensus says: &quot;&quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; finds director Preston Sturges at his most zanily subversive -- not to mention hilarious.&quot; Metacritic assigned a weighted average of 86 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot; and labelling it a &quot;must see&quot;.

In a positive review of nine out of ten stars by Mike Massie, writing for &quot;Gone With The Twins&quot;, states the film is &quot;handled with a spectacular hilarity and cleverness; when the hole is dug this deep, the only way out is through further outrageousness.&quot; Jeffrey M. Anderson of &quot;Combustible Celluloid&quot; gave a rating of three-and-a-half stars out of four, noting the zany tone of the film, and positively questioning how Sturges got away with such a film, especially during the era of the Hays Code.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD and VHS on September 6, 2005.

==Accolades==
* The &quot;New York Times&quot; named it as one of the 10 Best Films of 1942–1944.

==Legacy==
In 2001, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; In 2006, it was voted by &quot;Premiere&quot; one of &quot;The 50 Greatest Comedies of All Time.&quot;

The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:
* 1998: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies – Nominated
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #54

The 1958 film &quot;Rock-A-Bye Baby&quot;, starring Jerry Lewis, was loosely based on &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Sturges received a credit for that film, but did not actually participate in the project.

<text>Miss Lulu Bett is a 1920 novel by American writer Zona Gale, later adapted for the stage. It was a bestseller at the time of its initial publication, but gradually fell out of favor through changing tastes and social conditions. It was the first play by a woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for Drama,

== Plot summary==
The story concerns a woman, Lulu, who lives with her sister&#x27;s family, essentially acting as a servant. She does not complain about her position but is not happy. When her brother-in-law&#x27;s brother, Ninian, comes to visit, there is a certain attraction between them. While joking around one evening they find themselves accidentally married, due to the laws of the state requiring little more than wedding vows to be recited while a magistrate is in the room for a marriage to count as legal. On learning this, Ninian and Lulu decide they like the idea of being married and choose to remain together. However, within a month, Lulu is back home, having discovered that Ninian was already legally married: 18 years prior he had wed a girl who left him after 2 years, but he had forgotten about it. Lulu considers this a reasonable story, but her brother-in-law, Dwight, insists that it would be a humiliation to the family to reveal such a thing, and insists that she tell everyone instead that Ninian grew bored with her and left her. Lulu is unable to see why this should be a less humiliating story, and begins to complain about her circumstances for the first time. She also notices that her teenage niece, Di, is unhappy, and also seems to be trying to use marriage as a way to escape her circumstance. Lulu eventually has to prevent Di from eloping, and is finally inspired to move out of her sister&#x27;s home and live independently.

==Adaptations==

Gale first adapted the novel for a play that opened on Broadway on December 27, 1920, starring Carroll McComas.

Two endings were written for the play, the original as seen in December 1920 (and the ending that won Gale the Pulitzer Prize from Drama; the first woman ever to do so) has Lulu starting a life on her own and undertaking adventures of her own as we hear in her final lines, &quot;Good-by. Good-by, all of you. I&#x27;m going I don&#x27;t know where-to work at I don&#x27;t know what. But I&#x27;m going from choice!&quot;

The revised ending is more typical and would have been a bit more commercially acceptable and far less challenging to the audiences of the day. In this ending, Ninian appears just as Lulu decides to go off on her own life to work and live elsewhere. He asks her forgiveness and she agrees saying &quot;I forgave you in Savannah, Georgia.&quot;

In 1921 the work was adapted for a silent film of the same name by Clara Beranger, directed by William C. deMille, starring Lois Wilson, Milton Sills, Theodore Roberts, Helen Ferguson, Mabel Van Buren, Ethel Wales and May Giraci.

<doc id="74961" wikidata="Q190640" url="?curid=74961" title="Rubber Soul">
<text>Rubber Soul is the sixth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 3 December 1965 in the United Kingdom on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label, accompanied by the non-album double A-side single &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; / &quot;Day Tripper&quot;. The original North American release, issued by Capitol Records, contains ten of the fourteen songs and two tracks withheld from the band&#x27;s &quot;Help!&quot; (1965) album. &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was described as an important artistic achievement by the band, meeting a highly favourable critical response and topping sales charts in Britain and the United States for several weeks.

The recording sessions took place in London over a four-week period beginning in October 1965. For the first time in their career, the Beatles were able to record an album free of concert, radio or film commitments. Often referred to as a folk rock album, particularly in its Capitol configuration, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; incorporates a mix of pop, soul and folk musical styles. The title derives from the colloquialism &quot;plastic soul&quot; and was the Beatles&#x27; way of acknowledging their lack of authenticity compared to the African-American soul artists they admired. After &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964), it was the second Beatles LP to contain only original material.

The songs demonstrate the Beatles&#x27; increasing maturity as lyricists, and in their incorporation of brighter guitar tones and new instrumentation such as sitar, harmonium and fuzz bass, the group striving for more expressive sounds and arrangements for their music. The project marked a progression in the band&#x27;s treatment of the album format as an artistic platform, an approach they continued to develop with &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966) and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967). The four songs omitted by Capitol, including the February 1966 single &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, later appeared on the North American release &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; (1966).

&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was highly influential on the Beatles&#x27; peers, leading to a widespread focus away from singles and onto creating albums of consistently high-quality songs. It has been recognised by music critics as an album that opened up the possibilities of pop music in terms of lyrical and musical scope, and as a key work in the creation of styles such as psychedelia and progressive rock. Among its many appearances on critics&#x27; best-album lists, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it fifth on the magazine&#x27;s 2012 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2000, it was voted at number 34 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. The album was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1997, indicating shipments of at least six million copies in the US. In 2013, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for UK sales since 1994.
==Background==

Most of the songs on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; were composed soon after the Beatles&#x27; return to London following their August 1965 North American tour. The album reflects the influence of their month in America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewisohn/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;Lewisohn, Mark. &quot;High Times&quot;. In: .&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from setting a new attendance record when they played to over 55,000 at Shea Stadium on 15 August, the tour allowed the band to meet with Bob Dylan in New York and their longtime hero Elvis Presley in Los Angeles. Although the Beatles had released their album &quot;Help!&quot; that same month, the requirement for a new album in time for Christmas was in keeping with the schedule established with EMI in 1963 by Brian Epstein, the group&#x27;s manager, and George Martin, their record producer.

In their new songs, the Beatles drew inspiration from soul music acts signed to the Motown and Stax record labels, particularly the singles they heard on US radio that summer, and from the contemporary folk rock of Dylan and the Byrds. Author Robert Rodriguez highlights the Byrds as having achieved &quot;special notice as an American act that had taken something from the Brits, added to it, then sent it back&quot;. In doing so, Rodriguez continues, the Byrds had joined the Beatles and Dylan in &quot;a common pool of influence exchange, where each act gave and took from the other in equal measure&quot;. According to music critic Tim Riley, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; served as a &quot;step toward a greater synthesis&quot; of all the elements that throughout 1965 represented a &quot;major &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; explosion&quot;, rather than just the emergence of folk rock. Citing Dylan and the Rolling Stones as the Beatles&#x27; artistic peers during this period, he says that on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; these two acts &quot;inspire rather than influence their sound&quot;.

Two years after the start of Beatlemania, the band were open to exploring new themes in their music through a combination of their tiring of playing to audiences full of screaming fans, their commercial power, a shared curiosity gained through literature and experimentation with hallucinogenic drugs, and their interest in the potential of the recording studio. According to Ringo Starr, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was the Beatles&#x27; &quot;departure record&quot;, written and recorded during a period when, largely through the influence of marijuana, &quot;We were expanding in all areas of our lives, opening up to a lot of different attitudes.&quot; The album was especially reflective of John Lennon&#x27;s maturation as a songwriter, as he was encouraged to address wider-ranging issues than before through Dylan&#x27;s example. George Harrison&#x27;s outlook had been transformed by his and Lennon&#x27;s experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD; he said the drug had revealed to him the futility of the band&#x27;s widespread fame by &quot;open[ing] up this whole other consciousness&quot;.

Author Mark Prendergast recognises &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as &quot;the first Beatles record which was noticeably drug-influenced&quot;. Lennon called it &quot;the pot album&quot;. Marijuana appealed to the band&#x27;s bohemian ideal. Paul McCartney, who was the only Beatle still living in central London, said it was typical of a move away from alcohol and into &quot;more of a beatnik scene, like jazz&quot;.
==Production==
===Recording history===

Recording for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; began on 12 October 1965 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London; final production and mix down took place on 15 November. During the sessions, the Beatles typically focused on fine-tuning the musical arrangement for each song, an approach that reflected the growing division between the band as a live act and their ambitions as recording artists. The album was one of the first projects that Martin undertook after leaving EMI&#x27;s staff and co-founding Associated Independent Recording (AIR). Martin later described &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as &quot;the first album to present a new, growing Beatles to the world&quot;, adding: &quot;For the first time we began to think of albums as art on their own, as complete entities.&quot; It was the final Beatles album that recording engineer Norman Smith worked on before being promoted by EMI to record producer. The sessions were held over thirteen days and totalled 113 hours, with a further seventeen hours (spread over six days) allowed for mixing.
The band were forced to work to a tight deadline to ensure the album was completed in time for a pre-Christmas release. They were nevertheless in the unfamiliar position of being able to dedicate themselves solely to a recording project, free of touring, filming and radio engagements. The Beatles ceded to two interruptions during this time. They received their MBEs at Buckingham Palace on 26 October, from Queen Elizabeth II, and on 1–2 November, the band filmed their segments for &quot;The Music of Lennon &amp; McCartney&quot;, a Granada Television tribute to the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership. According to author Christopher Bray, this intensive recording made &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; not just unusual in the Beatles&#x27; career but &quot;emphatically unlike those LPs made by other bands&quot;. From 4 November – by which point only around half the required number of songs were near completion – the Beatles&#x27; sessions were routinely booked to finish at 3 am each day.

After &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; in 1964, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was the second Beatles album to contain only original material. As the band&#x27;s main writers, Lennon and McCartney struggled to complete enough songs for the project. After a session on 27 October was cancelled due to a lack of new material, Martin told a reporter that he and the group &quot;hope to resume next week&quot; but would not consider recording songs by any other composers. The Beatles completed &quot;Wait&quot; for the album, having taped its rhythm track during the sessions for &quot;Help!&quot; in June 1965. They also recorded the instrumental &quot;12-Bar Original&quot;, a twelve-bar blues in the style of Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s. Credited to Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr, it remained unreleased until 1996.

The group recorded &quot;Day Tripper&quot; and &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; during the &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; sessions for release as a single accompanying the album. To avoid having to promote the single with numerous television appearances, the Beatles chose to produce film clips for the two songs, the first time they had done so for a single. Directed by Joe McGrath, the clips were filmed at Twickenham Film Studios in south-west London on 23 November.

===Studio aesthetic and sounds===

Lennon recalled that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was the first album over which the Beatles took control in the studio and made demands rather than accept standard recording practices. According to Riley, the album reflects &quot;a new affection for recording&quot; over live performance. Author Philip Norman similarly writes that, with the Beatles increasingly drawn towards EMI&#x27;s large cache of &quot;exotic&quot; musical instruments, combined with their readiness to incorporate &quot;every possible resource of the studio itself&quot; and Martin&#x27;s skills as a classical arranger, &quot;Implicitly, from the very start, this [music] was not stuff intended to be played live on stage.&quot;

According to Barry Miles, a leading figure in the UK underground whom Lennon and McCartney befriended at this time, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and its 1966 follow-up, &quot;Revolver&quot;, were &quot;when [the Beatles] got away from George Martin, and became a creative entity unto themselves&quot;. In 1995, Harrison said that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was his favourite Beatles album, adding: &quot;we certainly knew we were making a good album. We did spend more time on it and tried new things. But the most important thing about it was that we were suddenly hearing sounds that we weren&#x27;t able to hear before.&quot;

During the sessions, McCartney played a solid-body Rickenbacker 4001 bass guitar, which produced a fuller sound than his hollow-body Hofner. The Rickenbacker&#x27;s design allowed for greater melodic precision, a characteristic that led McCartney to contribute more intricate bass lines. For the rest of his Beatles career, the Rickenbacker would become McCartney&#x27;s primary bass for studio work. Harrison used a Fender Stratocaster for the first time, most notably in his lead guitar part on &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;. The variety in guitar tones throughout the album was also aided by Harrison and Lennon&#x27;s use of capos, such as in the high-register parts on &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; and &quot;Girl&quot;.
On &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, the Beatles departed from standard rock and roll instrumentation, particularly in Harrison&#x27;s use of the Indian sitar on &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;. Having been introduced to the string instrument on the set of the 1965 film &quot;Help!&quot;, Harrison&#x27;s interest was fuelled by fellow Indian music fans Roger McGuinn and David Crosby of the Byrds, partway through the Beatles&#x27; US tour. Music journalist Paul Du Noyer describes the sitar part as &quot;simply a sign of the whole band&#x27;s hunger for new musical colours&quot;, but also &quot;the pivotal moment of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;&quot;. The Beatles also made use of harmonium during the sessions, marking that instrument&#x27;s introduction into rock music.

The band&#x27;s willingness to experiment with sound was further demonstrated in McCartney playing fuzz bass on &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; over his standard bass part, and their employing a piano made to sound like a baroque harpsichord on &quot;In My Life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Easlea/BBC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The latter effect came about when, in response to Lennon suggesting he play something &quot;like Bach&quot;, Martin recorded the piano solo with the tape running at half-speed; when played back at normal speed, the sped-up sound gave the illusion of a harpsichord. In this way, the Beatles used the recording studio as a musical instrument, an approach that they and Martin developed further with &quot;Revolver&quot;. In Prendergast&#x27;s description, &quot;bright ethnic percussion&quot; was among the other &quot;great sounds&quot; that filled the album.

Lennon, McCartney and Harrison&#x27;s three-part harmony singing was another musical detail that came to typify the &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; sound. According to musicologist Walter Everett, some of the vocal arrangements feature the same &quot;pantonal planing of three-part root-position triads&quot; adopted by the Byrds, who had initially based their harmonies on the style used by the Beatles and other British Invasion bands. Riley says that the Beatles softened their music on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, yet by reverting to slower tempos they &quot;draw attention to how much rhythm can do&quot;. Wide separation in the stereo image ensured that subtleties in the musical arrangements were heard; in Riley&#x27;s description, this quality emphasised the &quot;richly textured&quot; arrangements over &quot;everything being stirred together into one high-velocity mass&quot;.

McCartney said that as part of their increased involvement in the album&#x27;s production, the band members attended the mixing sessions rather than let Martin work in their absence. Until late in their career, the &quot;primary&quot; version of the Beatles&#x27; albums was always the monophonic mix. According to Beatles historian Bruce Spizer, Martin and the EMI engineers devoted most of their time and attention to the mono mixdowns, and generally regarded stereo as a gimmick. The band were not usually present for the stereo mixing sessions.

===Band dynamics===
While Martin recalled the sessions as having been &quot;a very joyful time&quot;, Smith felt &quot;something had happened between &quot;Help!&quot; and &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;&quot;, and the family atmosphere that had once characterised the relationship between the Beatles and their production team was absent. He said the project revealed the first signs of artistic conflict between Lennon and McCartney, and friction within the band as more effort was spent on perfecting each song. This also manifested in a struggle over which song should be the A-side of their next single, with Lennon insisting on &quot;Day Tripper&quot; (of which he was the primary writer) and publicly contradicting EMI&#x27;s announcement about the upcoming release.

In addition, a rift was growing between McCartney and his bandmates as he continued to abstain from taking LSD. The revelations provided by the drug had drawn Lennon and Harrison closer, and were then shared by Starr when, during the band&#x27;s stay in Los Angeles that August, he agreed to try LSD for the first time.

==Songs==
===Overview===
Pop historian Andrew Grant Jackson describes &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as a &quot;synthesis of folk, rock, soul, baroque, proto-psychedelia, and the sitar&quot;. According to author Joe Harrington, the album contained the Beatles&#x27; first &quot;psychedelic experiments&quot;, heralding the transformational effect of LSD on many of the original British Invasion acts. Author Bernard Gendron dismisses the commonly held view that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is a folk rock album; he cites its incorporation of baroque and Eastern sounds as examples of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;nascent experimentalism and eclectic power of appropriation&quot;, aspects that he says suggest an artistic approach that transcends the genre. According to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot;, building on the Beatles&#x27; 1964 track &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Spoil the Party&quot;, the album can be seen in retrospect as an early example of country rock, anticipating the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; album.

Further to Lennon&#x27;s more introspective outlook in 1964, particularly on &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;, the lyrics on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; represent a pronounced development in sophistication, thoughtfulness and ambiguity. According to music critic Greil Marcus, &quot;the Beatles were still writing about love, but this was a new kind of love: contingent, scary and vital&quot;, and so, while the music was &quot;seduction, not assault&quot;, the &quot;emotional touch&quot; was tougher than before. Author James Decker considers it significant that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; &quot;took its narrative cues more from folk crossovers such as Bob Dylan and the Byrds than from the Beatles&#x27; pop cohorts&quot;. In particular, the relationships between the sexes moved from simpler boy-girl love songs to more nuanced and negative portrayals. In this way, Lennon and McCartney offered candid insights into their personal lives.

===Side one===
====&quot;Drive My Car&quot;====

The album opens with a pair of lead guitar parts that are soon rendered off-metre by the arrival of McCartney&#x27;s bass. &quot;Drive My Car&quot; is a McCartney composition with substantial contribution from Lennon with the lyrics. Harrison, as the Beatles&#x27; most knowledgeable soul-music enthusiast, contributed heavily to the recording by suggesting they arrange the song with a dual guitar–bass riff in the style of Otis Redding&#x27;s contemporary single &quot;Respect&quot;. In their joint lead vocals, McCartney and Lennon sing dissonant harmonies, a quality that is furthered by Harrison&#x27;s entrance and signifies what Everett terms a &quot;new jazzy sophistication … in the vocal arrangement&quot;.

The lyrics convey an actress&#x27;s desire to become a film star and her promise to the narrator that he can be her chauffeur. According to Riley, the song satirises the &quot;ethics of materialism&quot; and serves as a &quot;parody of the Beatles&#x27; celebrity status and the status-seekers they meet&quot;. Author and critic Kenneth Womack describes the lyrics as being &quot;loaded with sexual innuendo&quot;, and he says that the female protagonist challenged the gendered expectations of a mid-1960s pop audience, as an &quot;everywoman&quot; with ego and a clear agenda.

====&quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot;====

Lennon said he wrote &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; about an extramarital affair and that he worded the narrative to hide the truth from his wife, Cynthia. The lyrics sketch a failed meeting between the singer and a mysterious girl, where she goes to bed and he sleeps in the bath;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unterberger/NW&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in retaliation at the girl&#x27;s aloofness, the singer decides to burn down her pine-panelled home. Arranged in 12/8 time, and in the English folk style, the song has a Mixolydian melody that results in a drone effect in the acoustic guitars, complementing the sitar part, though switches to parallel scale of E Dorian during its middle eight. The narrative draws heavily on Dylan&#x27;s style through its use of ambiguity. In author Jonathan Gould&#x27;s description, the song is an &quot;emotional black comedy&quot;, while Decker recognises it as a continuation of the &quot;interrogation of sexual ambiguities&quot; and &quot;muddled sense of power&quot; displayed in &quot;Drive My Car&quot;.
====&quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot;====
Written by McCartney, &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; reflects the difficulties he was experiencing in his relationship with actress Jane Asher due to her refusal to put her acting career second to his needs. Gould identifies the song as the third consecutive track in which the narrative conveys miscommunication. McCartney described its music as &quot;very Motown-flavored&quot;, with a &quot;feel&quot; inspired by Motown bassist James Jamerson. The verses use the same chord sequence as the Four Tops&#x27; hit &quot;It&#x27;s the Same Old Song&quot;, which was titled by its writers, the Holland–Dozier–Holland team, in acknowledgement that they had already used the same pattern in their composition &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help Myself&quot;.

====&quot;Nowhere Man&quot;====

Lennon recalled that &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; came to him fully formed one night at his home in Surrey, after he had struggled to write anything for several hours. The song reflects the existential concerns raised by his experiences with LSD, and, like &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;, his self-loathing during a time he later called his &quot;fat Elvis period&quot;. It was the first Beatles song to completely avoid boy–girl relationships, and through Lennon conveying his feelings of inadequacy in the third person, the first example of a literary character in the Beatles&#x27; work. Riley views the message as a precursor to the &quot;I&#x27;d love to turn you on&quot; theme of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; and, aided by the band&#x27;s performance, optimistic in tone as Lennon &quot;sings for the unsung, the people who have shut themselves off from life&quot;.

Heavy equalisation was applied to the electric guitar parts through a series of faders, giving them a treble-rich texture that, as with the harmony vocals, recalls the Byrds&#x27; sound. In Prendergast&#x27;s description, the track &quot;burst[s] forth with all the gusto of newly discovered psychedelia&quot;, as Lennon&#x27;s lead vocal &quot;luxuriates in an opiated haze of production and Harrison&#x27;s Fender Stratocaster solo fuzzes with all the right hallucinatory sparkle&quot;.

====&quot;Think for Yourself&quot;====
Harrison&#x27;s lyrics to &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; suggest the influence of Dylan&#x27;s September 1965 single &quot;Positively 4th Street&quot;, as Harrison appears to rebuke a friend or lover. The song&#x27;s accusatory message was unprecedented in the Beatles&#x27; work; Jackson identifies it as the band&#x27;s contribution to a &quot;subgenre&quot; of protest songs that emerged in 1965, in which artists railed against &quot;oppressive conformity itself&quot; rather than political issues. Everett describes the composition as &quot;a tour de force of altered scale degrees&quot;. He adds that, such is the ambiguity throughout, &quot;its tonal quality forms the perfect conspirator with the text&#x27;s and the rhythm&#x27;s hesitations and unexpected turns.&quot; Gould writes that, in its dialogue with Harrison&#x27;s vocal, McCartney&#x27;s fuzz bass suggests &quot;the snarls of an enraged schnauzer, snapping and striking at its lead&quot;.

====&quot;The Word&quot;====

In his book &quot;1965: The Year Modern Britain Was Born&quot;, Bray recognises &quot;The Word&quot; as marking the start of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;high psychedelic period&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s exhortation that &quot;The word is love&quot; anticipates the ethos behind the counterculture&#x27;s 1967 Summer of Love. The lyrics focus on the concept of universal love as a path to spiritual enlightenment, with what Decker terms &quot;proselytizing zeal&quot; on the narrator&#x27;s part. Author Ian MacDonald recognises the &quot;distant influence&quot; of Wilson Pickett&#x27;s &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; and James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot; on the song&#x27;s rhythm, and highlights Starr&#x27;s drumming (for its &quot;feast of eccentric &#x27;backwards fills) and McCartney&#x27;s dextrous bass playing. The arrangement also includes seven vocal parts and Martin playing suspended chords on harmonium.

====&quot;Michelle&quot;====
&quot;Michelle&quot; was conceived by McCartney in the late 1950s. During a writing session for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, Lennon added a new middle eight, part of which was taken from Nina Simone&#x27;s recent cover of &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halpin/Louder&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald identifies the song as another example of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;comedy song&quot; approach, which, in a contemporary interview, McCartney had suggested was a possible new direction for the group. In Womack&#x27;s view, the French phrases in the lyrics accentuate the premise whereby a language barrier separates two lovers, and the narrative conveys an acceptance that their relationship is doomed to fail, such that the singer is already looking back nostalgically at what could have been. Gould describes the performance as &quot;sentimental … French cabaret&quot; which, following McCartney&#x27;s declaration of &quot;I love you&quot;, leads into a guitar solo by Harrison that represents &quot;one of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s existential café workers&quot;.

===Side two===
====&quot;What Goes On&quot;====
The Beatles had attempted to record an early version of Lennon&#x27;s &quot;What Goes On&quot; in 1963. With little time to complete &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, the song was reworked by Lennon and McCartney as a vocal spot for Starr, who also received his first songwriting credit, as co-composer. The song is in the country style favoured by Starr, and in its lyrics the singer laments his lover&#x27;s deceit. In Everett&#x27;s description, the arrangement includes Harrison&#x27;s rockabilly-inflected lead guitar, played on his Gretsch Tennessean, contrasting with Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Steve Cropper-styled Memphis &#x27;chick&#x27; rhythm part&quot;.

====&quot;Girl&quot;====
Lennon said he wrote &quot;Girl&quot; about an archetypal woman he had been searching for and would finally find in Yoko Ono, the Japanese artist he met in November 1966. In the lyrics, he also expresses his disdain for Christian moral values. The song was the final track recorded for the album. The composition incorporates aspects of Greek folk music, while the arrangement includes an instrumental passage set as a German two-step and an acoustic guitar part played to sound like a Greek bouzouki. High equalisation was applied to Lennon&#x27;s vocal over the choruses to capture the hissing sound as he drew breath – an effect that also suggested he was inhaling on a marijuana joint. McCartney recalled that he and Harrison sang &quot;Tit-tit-tit&quot; on the middle eights to capture the &quot;innocence&quot; of the Beach Boys singing &quot;La-la-la&quot; on one of their recent songs. Riley likens the musical arrangement to a &quot;scene from the old world&quot; and he concludes of the song: &quot;The old-fashioned atmosphere conveys desire and deception, and Lennon sings it as much to console himself as to make sense of its bewildering proportions (&#x27;And she promises the earth to me and I believe her/After all this time I don&#x27;t know why&#x27;). It&#x27;s the sympathetic side of the anger in &#x27;Norwegian Wood.

====&quot;I&#x27;m Looking Through You&quot;====
Like &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; and &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Looking Through You&quot; focuses on McCartney&#x27;s troubled relationship with Asher. Gould describes it as the &quot;disillusioned sequel&quot; to McCartney&#x27;s other 1965 songs centring on &quot;a face-to-face (if not necessarily eye-to-eye) encounter between two lovers&quot;. Decker likens the lyrics to a less philosophical version of &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; in which &quot;the narrator has grown, yet the woman has failed to keep up.&quot; The composition contrasts acoustic-based verses with harsher, R&amp;B-style instrumental sections, suggesting a combination of the folk rock and soul styles. The Beatles had taped two versions of the song before achieving the final version, which they recorded during the last, frantic day of the &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; sessions. In its final form, the song gained a middle eight where previously there had been a twelve-bar blues jam.

====&quot;In My Life&quot;====

Lennon credited a remark made by BBC journalist Kenneth Allsop, who had asked why his songs appeared to lack the wordplay and childhood focus evident in his 1964 book &quot;In His Own Write&quot;, as the catalyst for &quot;In My Life&quot;. Lennon considered the song to be his &quot;first real major piece of work&quot;. The lyrics evoke his youth in Liverpool and reflect his nostalgia for a time before the onset of international fame. McCartney recalled writing the melody on his own and said that the song&#x27;s musical inspiration came from Smokey Robinson and the Miracles; according to Lennon, McCartney merely assisted in writing what he called &quot;the middle-eight melody&quot;. In Gould&#x27;s description, &quot;In My Life&quot; &quot;owed a conscious debt&quot; to the Miracles&#x27; contemporary hit &quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot; and thereby served as &quot;the most recent installment in the lively cultural exchange between Motown&#x27;s Hitsville Studios and EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road&quot;.

Martin&#x27;s Bach-inspired piano solo was overdubbed in the Beatles&#x27; absence, over a section that they had left empty. Womack says that the baroque aspect of this contribution furthers the song&#x27;s nostalgic qualities, a point also made by Gould, who adds that, by revisiting the past and presenting emotional themes that are resolved in the narrative, &quot;In My Life&quot; serves as the album&#x27;s only song that &quot;sounds the Beatles&#x27; original ground theme of happiness-in-relationship&quot;.

====&quot;Wait&quot;====
&quot;Wait&quot; was a Lennon composition to which McCartney contributed a middle eight. Gould includes the song among a category of Beatles coming home&#x27; songs&quot;, while Riley pairs it with &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Long&quot; but adds that, relative to that 1963 song, in &quot;Wait&quot; &quot;the lovers&#x27; reunion has more anxiety than euphoria goading the beat.&quot; The band completed the track on the final day of recording for the album, overdubbing tone-pedal lead guitar, percussion and a new vocal by McCartney onto the June 1965 rhythm track. MacDonald writes that, although Lennon and McCartney would most likely have viewed the subject matter as dated even in June, the group&#x27;s performance gives the song the required &quot;drive and character&quot; for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, particularly Starr&#x27;s approach to the rhythm changes between its contrasting sections.

====&quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;====
Harrison wrote &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; as a love song to Pattie Boyd, the English model to whom he became engaged in December 1965 and married the following month. In the song&#x27;s Rickenbacker 12-string guitar riff, the Beatles returned the compliment paid to them earlier in 1965 by the Byrds, whose jangly guitar-based sound McGuinn had sourced from Harrison&#x27;s playing the previous year. In MacDonald&#x27;s view, the song is influenced &quot;far more&quot; by Indian classical music than by the Byrds, through Harrison&#x27;s partly Mixolydian melody and the presence of drone. The latter aspect is furthered by McCartney&#x27;s arpeggiated bass line in A major continuing over the chord change to a VII triad.

The detached, dispassionate tone in the lyrics has invited alternative interpretations. Gould refers to it as &quot;a rueful rain check of a love song&quot; directed to the &quot;right person at the wrong time&quot;; according to Jackson, &quot;the lyrics address all the women of the world, saying that had he met them earlier [before committing to Boyd], it might have worked out, but now he was too much in love (but give me your number just in case)&quot;.

====&quot;Run for Your Life&quot;====
Lennon wrote &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; based on &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Play House&quot;, which was one of Presley&#x27;s early singles on the Sun record label. Lennon retained a line from the Presley track – &quot;I&#x27;d rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man&quot;. The lyrical theme is jealousy, betraying an overtly misogynistic quality that Decker finds at odds with the Beatles&#x27; approach to making the album. Performed in the country style, it was the first track recorded for the album and features a descending guitar riff played by Harrison and slide guitar parts.

=== North American format===
Adhering to the company&#x27;s policy for the Beatles&#x27; albums in the United States, Capitol Records altered the content of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; for its release there. They removed &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;What Goes On&quot; and &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;, all of which were instead issued on the Beatles&#x27; next North American album, &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;, in June 1966. The four songs were replaced with &quot;I&#x27;ve Just Seen a Face&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot;, which had been cut from &quot;Help!&quot; as part of Capitol&#x27;s reconfiguring of that LP to serve as a true soundtrack album, consisting of Beatles songs and orchestral music from the film.

Through the mix of predominantly acoustic-based songs, according to Womack, the North American release &quot;takes on a decidedly folk-ish orientation&quot;. Capitol sequenced &quot;I&#x27;ve Just Seen a Face&quot; as the opening track, reflecting the company&#x27;s attempt to present &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as a folk-rock album, and &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot; opened side two. Gould writes that the omission of songs such as &quot;Drive My Car&quot; provided a &quot;misleading idea&quot; of the Beatles&#x27; musical direction and &quot;turned the album title into an even more obscure joke&quot;, since the result was the band&#x27;s least soul- or R&amp;B-influenced album up to this point. The stereo mixes used by Capitol contained two false starts at the beginning of &quot;I&#x27;m Looking Through You&quot;, while &quot;The Word&quot; also differed from the UK version due to the double-tracking of Lennon&#x27;s lead vocal, the addition of an extra falsetto harmony and the panning treatment given to one of the percussion parts.

==Title and artwork==
The album title was intended as a pun combining the falseness intrinsic to pop music and rubber-soled shoes. Lennon said the title was McCartney&#x27;s idea and referred to &quot;English soul&quot;. In a 1966 press conference, Starr said they called the album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; to acknowledge that, in comparison to American soul artists, &quot;we are white and haven&#x27;t got what they&#x27;ve got&quot;, and he added that this was true of all the British acts who attempted to play soul music. McCartney recalled that he conceived the title after overhearing an American musician describing Mick Jagger&#x27;s singing style as &quot;plastic soul&quot;. In Phillip Norman&#x27;s view, the title served as &quot;a sly dig at their archrivals (and private best mates) the Rolling Stones&quot;, with the added implication that the Beatles&#x27; &quot;variety&quot; of soul music &quot;at least was stamped out by a good strong northern [English] Wellington boot&quot;.

&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was the group&#x27;s first album not to feature their name on the cover, an omission that reflected the level of control they had over their releases and the extent of their international fame. The cover photo of the Beatles was taken by photographer Robert Freeman in the garden at Lennon&#x27;s house. The idea for the &quot;stretched&quot; effect of the image came about by accident when Freeman was projecting the photo onto an LP-size piece of cardboard for the Beatles&#x27; benefit, and the board fell slightly backwards, elongating the projected image. Harrison said the effect was appropriate since it allowed the group to lose &quot;the &#x27;little innocents&#x27; tag, the naivety&quot; and it was in keeping with their emergence as &quot;fully fledged potheads&quot;. Author Peter Doggett highlights the cover as an example of the Beatles, like Dylan and the Stones, &quot;continu[ing] to test the limits of the portrait&quot; in their LP designs.

The distinctive lettering was created by illustrator Charles Front, who recalled that his inspiration was the album&#x27;s title: &quot;If you tap into a rubber tree then you get a sort of globule, so I started thinking of creating a shape that represented that, starting narrow and filling out.&quot; The rounded letters used on the sleeve established a style that became ubiquitous in psychedelic designs and, according to journalist Lisa Bachelor, &quot;a staple of poster art for the flower power generation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bachelor/Guardian&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label issued &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; on 3 December 1965. The &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; / &quot;Day Tripper&quot; single was also released that day and was the first example of a double A-side single in Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;White/OCC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; EMI announced that it had pressed 750,000 copies of the LP to cater to local demand. Its advance orders of 500,000 almost equalled the total sales for the new single and were described by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;″s show business reporter as marking a new record for pre-release orders for an LP.

On the day of the album&#x27;s release, the Beatles performed at the Odeon Cinema in Glasgow, marking the start of what would be their final UK tour. Weary of Beatlemania, the group had conceded to do a short tour, although they refused to reprise their Christmas Show from the 1963–64 and 1964–65 holiday seasons. They performed both sides of the single throughout the tour, but only &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; from the new album. In the United States, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was their tenth album and their first to consist entirely of original songs. The release took place there on 6 December.
In an interview following the album&#x27;s release, McCartney said that although people had &quot;always wanted us to stay the same&quot;, he saw no reason for the Beatles to pander to such limitations, adding, &quot;&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; for me is the beginning of my adult life.&quot; Lennon commented, &quot;You don&#x27;t know us if you don&#x27;t know &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.&quot;

According to Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner, Freeman&#x27;s cover photo was viewed as &quot;daringly surreal&quot; and led some fans to write to the band&#x27;s official fanzine, &quot;Beatles Monthly&quot;, alarmed that the image &quot;made their heroes look like corpses&quot;. In her study of the Beatles&#x27; contemporary audience, sociologist Candy Leonard writes that some young listeners were challenged by the band&#x27;s new musical direction, but &quot;With &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, the Beatles came to occupy a role in fans&#x27; lives and a place in their psyches that was different from any previous fan–performer relationship.&quot; Singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, who was an eleven-year-old fan at the time, later recalled thinking that the band had &quot;lost their minds&quot;. He added: &quot;I didn&#x27;t understand a word, I didn&#x27;t think it was any good, and then six weeks later you couldn&#x27;t live without the record. And that&#x27;s good – that&#x27;s when you trust the people who make music to take you somewhere you haven&#x27;t been before.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; began its 42-week run on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; LPs chart (subsequently adopted as the UK Albums Chart) on 12 December 1965. The following week it replaced the &quot;Sound of Music&quot; soundtrack at the top of the chart, where it remained for eight weeks in total. On the national chart compiled by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; entered at number 1 and held the position for thirteen weeks; it remained in the top ten until mid July 1966. In the United States, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart on 8 January 1966, having sold 1.2 million copies there within nine days of release. These initial sales were unprecedented for an LP and were cited by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine as evidence of a new market trend in the US in which pop albums started to match the numbers of singles sold. The album was number 1 for six weeks in total; it remained in the top twenty until the start of July, before leaving the chart in mid December. As the more popular of the joint A-sides, &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; became the Beatles&#x27; sixth consecutive number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, all of which were achieved over a twelve-month period from January 1965.

While British albums typically avoided including previously released songs, the lack of a hit single on the North American version of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; added to the album&#x27;s identity there as a self-contained artistic statement. Everett writes that in the US the album&#x27;s &quot;hit&quot; was &quot;Michelle&quot;, through its popularity on radio playlists. After their inclusion on the EMI-format LP, &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; and &quot;Michelle&quot; were each issued as singles in various markets outside Britain and America, with &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; topping the Australian chart in May 1966. &quot;Nowhere Mans first release in North America was as a single A-side, backed by &quot;What Goes On&quot;, in February, before both tracks appeared on &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;. &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; topped &quot;Record World&quot;″s singles chart in the US and Canada&#x27;s &quot;RPM&quot; 100 chart, but peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In July, Parlophone released an EP titled &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, which contained &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;Michelle&quot; and two other songs from &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.

The album was also the source of hit songs for several other contemporary artists. &quot;Michelle&quot; became one of the most widely recorded of all the Beatles&#x27; songs. Cover versions of &quot;Girl&quot;, &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; similarly placed on UK or US singles charts in 1966.

In the UK, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was the third highest-selling album of 1965, behind &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mawer/1965&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the third highest-selling album of 1966, behind &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mawer/1966&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of its commercial success there surprised the music industry, which had sought to re-establish the LP market as the domain of adult record-buyers. From early 1966, record companies in the UK ceased their policy of promoting adult-oriented entertainers over rock acts, and embraced budget albums for their lower-selling artists to cater to the increased demand for LPs. In the US, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was the fourth highest-selling album of 1966, as reported in &quot;Billboard&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB/TopOf66&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to figures published in 2009 by former Capitol executive David Kronemyer, further to estimates he gave in &quot;MuseWire&quot; magazine, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; sold 1,800,376 copies in America by the end of 1965 and 2,766,862 by the close of the decade. As of 1997, it had shipped over 6 million copies there. In 2013, after the British Phonographic Industry altered its sales award protocol, the album was certified Platinum based on UK sales since 1994.
==Critical reception==
===Contemporary reviews===
Critical response to &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was highly favourable. Allen Evans of the &quot;NME&quot; wrote that the band were &quot;still finding different ways to make us enjoy listening to them&quot; and described the LP as &quot;a fine piece of recording artistry and adventure in group sound&quot;. While outlining to American readers the differences in the UK-format release, &quot;KRLA Beat&quot; said &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was an &quot;unbelievably sensational&quot; work on which the Beatles were &quot;once again ... setting trends in this world of pop&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; lauded the Beatles as &quot;the Bards of Pop&quot;, saying that the album&#x27;s combination of &quot;gospel, country, baroque counterpoint and even French popular ballads&quot; lent the band a unique style in which their songs were &quot;as brilliantly original as any written today&quot;. Like &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; had belittled the group when they first performed in America in February 1964, but following the release of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, entertainment critic Jack Gould wrote an effusive tribute in the newspaper&#x27;s Sunday magazine. In &quot;HiFi/Stereo Review&quot;, Morgan Ames wrote that, like other supportive professional musicians, he recognised the devices the band employed as &quot;they tromp on the art of music&quot;, and while he viewed their formal musicality as limited, he expressed joy at its effectiveness. Having opened the review by saying, &quot;The Beatles sound more and more like music&quot;, he concluded of the album: &quot;Their blend is excellent, their performance smooth, and their charm, wit and excitement run high.&quot;

The writers of &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s initial review found the LP lacking some of the variety of the group&#x27;s previous releases but also said: &quot;one marvels and wonders at the constant stream of melodic ingenuity stemming from the boys, both as performers and composers. Keeping up their pace of creativeness is quite fantastic.&quot; By contrast, Richard Green wrote in the same magazine that most of the album &quot;if recorded by anyone the Beatles, would not be worthy of release&quot;, with many of the tracks devoid of &quot;the old Beatles excitement and compulsiveness&quot;. Green acknowledged that his was an unpopular opinion, before stating: &quot;Judging LPs strictly on their merits, recent albums from Manfred Mann, the Beach Boys and Jerry Lee Lewis rank high above &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.&quot;

In another review that Richard Williams later cited as an example of the British pop press not being &quot;quite ready&quot; for the album, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; found the Beatles&#x27; new sound &quot;a little subdued&quot; and said that tracks such as &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; &quot;almost get monotonous – an un-Beatle-like feature if ever there was one&quot;. Author Steve Turner also highlights the comments made by the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Record Mirror&quot; reviewers, who were typically aged over 30, as indicative of how UK pop journalists lacked &quot;the critical vocabulary&quot; and &quot;the broad musical perspective&quot; to recognise or engage with progressive music. Turner adds that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; &quot;may have perplexed the old guard of entertainment correspondents, but it was a beacon for fledgling rock critics (as they would soon be called)&quot;. Among the few newspaper columnists seriously reviewing rock music was Ralph J. Gleason, jazz critic for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, who credited &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; with &quot;experimenting far past the style of outright imitations of Negro rhythm and blues artists&quot; which had often characterised the Beatles&#x27; earlier work. In a February1966 article, he contended it was &quot;one of the most universally appealing albums ever issued&quot;, extending the band&#x27;s reach beyond teenagers to &quot;[a]ll ages, all colors, all sexes, [and] all social and economic levels&quot;.

In a September 1966 review of &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;KRLA Beat&quot; said that the title of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; had &quot;become a standard phrase used to describe a creation of exceptional excellence in the field of music&quot;, such that several highly regarded releases had since earned the description &quot;a ″&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; in its field. Writing in &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1967, Robert Christgau called it &quot;an album that for innovation, tightness, and lyrical intelligence was about twice as good as anything they or anyone else (except maybe the Stones) had done previously&quot;.

===Retrospective assessment===

According to Decker, notwithstanding the band&#x27;s advances in 1964, music critics generally view &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as the Beatles&#x27; transitional&#x27; album ... from successful pop act to unparalleled masters of the studio&quot;. It is frequently cited by commentators as the first of their &quot;classic&quot; albums. Greil Marcus described it as the best of all the band&#x27;s LPs. In his 1979 essay on the Beatles in &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, Marcus wrote: &quot;&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was an album &quot;made&quot; as an album; with the exception of &#x27;Michelle&#x27; (which, to be fair, paid the bills for years to come), every cut was an inspiration, something new and remarkable in and of itself.&quot;

Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote in 2009: &quot;this is where things start to get very interesting ... &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is the result of their first extended period in the studio. The production is open and spacious, adorned but not yet overcrowded with new instruments and ideas. The songs themselves are like little Pop Art vignettes, where the lyrics are starting to match the quality of the melodies and arrangements.&quot; Scott Plagenhoef of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; describes the album as &quot;the most important artistic leap in the Beatles&#x27; career – the signpost that signaled a shift away from Beatlemania and the heavy demands of teen pop, toward more introspective, adult subject matter&quot;. Paul Du Noyer wrote in his review for &quot;Blender&quot; in 2004: &quot;Their talent was already a source of wonder, but now the songs themselves were turning mysterious. Under the influence of Bob Dylan – and, it might be said, marijuana – the Fab Four laced their tunefulness with new introspection, wordplay and social comment. University professors and newspaper columnists started taking note.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Paste&quot;, Mark Kemp says that the influence of Dylan and the Byrds seems overt at times but the album marks the start of the Beatles&#x27; peak in creativity and, in the context of 1965, offered &quot;an unprecedented synthesis of elements from folk-rock and beyond&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kemp/Paste&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richie Unterberger of AllMusic, the album&#x27;s lyrics represented &quot;a quantum leap in terms of thoughtfulness, maturity, and complex ambiguities&quot;, while the music was similarly progressive in its use of sounds beyond &quot;the conventional instrumental parameters of the rock group&quot;. He adds that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is &quot;full of great tunes&quot; from Lennon and McCartney notwithstanding their divergence from a common style, and demonstrates that Harrison &quot;was also developing into a fine songwriter&quot;. Writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, Colin Larkin describes it as &quot;not a collection of would-be hits or favourite cover versions … but a startlingly diverse collection, ranging from the pointed satire of &#x27;Nowhere Man&#x27; to the intensely reflective &#x27;In My Life&#x27;.&quot; In the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Rob Sheffield recognises &quot;Help!&quot; as &quot;the first chapter in the [Beatles&#x27;] astounding creative takeoff&quot;, after which the band &quot;grew up with an album of bittersweet romance, singing adult love ballads that feel worldly but not jaded&quot;.

In an article coinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Bob Stanley lamented that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was often overlooked in appraisals of the Beatles&#x27; recording career, whereas &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;The Beatles&quot; had each gained in stature to surpass &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Stanley highlighted &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as having been &quot;a good 18 months ahead of its time&quot; and &quot;the first album of the rock era that &quot;sounded&quot; like an album&quot;. Also writing in December 2015, in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Sheffield especially admired the singing and the modern qualities of the female characters depicted in the lyrics. He said that the album was &quot;way ahead of what anyone had done before&quot; and, given the short period in which they had to record, he called it the Beatles&#x27; &quot;accidental masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheffield/RS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Jon Friedman of &quot;Esquire&quot; finds the work vastly overrated, with only the Lennon-dominated songs &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;In My Life&quot; and &quot;Girl&quot; worthy of praise, and he dismisses it as &quot;dull&quot; and &quot;the Beatles&#x27; most inconsequential album&quot;. Although he considers that McCartney &quot;comes off third-string&quot; to Lennon and Harrison, Plagenhoef defends the album&#x27;s subtle mood; highlighting the influence of cannabis on the Beatles throughout 1965, he writes: &quot;With its patient pace and languid tones, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is an altogether much more mellow record than anything the Beatles had done before, or would do again. It&#x27;s a fitting product from a quartet just beginning to explore their inner selves on record.&quot; In his review for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham highlights the musical arrangements, three-part harmonies and judicious use of new sounds, in addition to the band&#x27;s improved musicianship and songwriting. He says that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; usually trails the Beatles&#x27; next four albums in critics&#x27; assessments of their work, yet &quot;it&#x27;s undoubtedly their pre-acid, pre-antagonism masterpiece: beat music as high art&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==
===Rivals&#x27; response===

Music historian Bill Martin says that the release of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was a &quot;turning point&quot; for pop music, in that for the first time &quot;the &quot;album&quot; rather than the song became the basic unit of artistic production.&quot; In author David Howard&#x27;s description, &quot;pop&#x27;s stakes had been raised into the stratosphere&quot; by &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, resulting in a shift in focus from singles to creating albums without the usual filler tracks. The release marked the start of a period when other artists, in an attempt to emulate the Beatles&#x27; achievement, sought to create albums as works of artistic merit and with increasingly novel sounds. According to Steve Turner, by galvanising the Beatles&#x27; most ambitious rivals in Britain and America, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; launched &quot;the pop equivalent of an arms race&quot;.

Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys described &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as &quot;the first album I listened to where every song was a gas&quot; and planned his band&#x27;s next project, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, as an attempt to surpass it. &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; similarly inspired Pete Townshend of the Who and the Kinks&#x27; Ray Davies, as well as Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, who issued their first album of all-original material, &quot;Aftermath&quot;, in April 1966. The album was also an influence on Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder and the Byrds. John Cale recalled that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was an inspiration as he and Lou Reed developed their band the Velvet Underground. He said it was the first time &quot;you were forced to deal with them as something other than a flash in the pan&quot; and especially admired Harrison&#x27;s introduction of Indian sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander/Mojo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In his chapter on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; in the Cambridge Companion to Music&#x27;s volume on the Beatles, James Decker credits the album with effecting the &quot;transformation&quot; of 1960s pop. In addition to citing it as the precedent for early experimental works by bands including the Kinks, Love and Jefferson Airplane, Decker writes that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; presented &quot;a variety of techniques hitherto unexplored in popular music&quot; while encouraging listeners &quot;to be cognizant of more flexible dimensions of pop music and to &quot;desire&quot; and &quot;expect&quot; them as well&quot;. Music historian Simon Philo also sees it as heralding the experimentation that characterised late-1960s rock. He describes it as an album-length confirmation of the &quot;transformation of pop&#x27;s range and reach&quot; that the Beatles had first achieved when &quot;Yesterday&quot;, McCartney&#x27;s introspective and classically orchestrated ballad, topped US singles charts in late 1965. In a 1968 article on the Beach Boys, Gene Sculatti of &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; recognised &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as the model for &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Aftermath&quot;, as well as &quot;the necessary prototype that no major rock group has been able to ignore&quot;.
===Cultural legitimisation of pop music===
&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is widely viewed as the first pop album to make an artistic statement through the quality of its songs, a point that was reinforced by its artsy cover photo. The belated acceptance of the Beatles by the editors of &quot;Newsweek&quot; was indicative of the magazine&#x27;s recognition of the band&#x27;s popularity among American intellectuals and the cultural elite. This in turn was reflected in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s appointment of Richard Goldstein, a recent graduate and New Journalism writer, to the new position of rock critic, in June 1966, and the Beatles&#x27; central role in achieving cultural legitimisation for pop music over 1966–67. Referring to the praise afforded the band, particularly the Lennon–McCartney partnership, by &quot;Newsweek&quot; in early 1966, Michael Frontani writes: &quot;The Beatles had a foothold in the world of art; in the months that followed, their efforts would lead to the full acceptance and legitimization of rock and roll as an art form.&quot;

Paul Williams launched &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; in February 1966 with the aim of reflecting the sophistication brought to the genre by &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; – the two albums that, in music journalist Barney Hoskyns&#x27; description, &quot;arguably gave birth to &#x27;rock&#x27; as a more solid concept than &#x27;pop. According to Sculatti, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was &quot;the definitive &#x27;rock as art&#x27; album, revolutionary in that it was a completely successful creative endeavor integrating with precision all aspects of the creative (rock) process – composition of individual tracks done with extreme care, each track arranged appropriately to fit beside each other track, the symmetrical rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll album&quot;. Christopher Bray describes it as &quot;the album that proved that rock and roll could be suitable for adult audiences&quot;, &quot;the first long-playing pop record to really merit the term &#x27;album and the LP that &quot;turned pop music into high art&quot;. Historian Marc Myers similarly credits it with &quot;mark[ing] rock&#x27;s shift from formulaic pop to studio experimentation and high art&quot;.

According to Du Noyer, through &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; blurring of the traditionally distinct dividing line between pop and high culture, and the perceived inferiority of singles, &quot;a rift occurred [in the UK] between pop and rock&quot;. He quotes writer Nik Cohn&#x27;s complaints that the &quot;danger signs&quot; for pop music&#x27;s loss of innocence were apparent on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, and poet Philip Larkin&#x27;s comment that &quot;[The Beatles&#x27;] fans stayed with them, and the nuttier intelligentsia, but they lost the typists in the Cavern.&quot; Du Noyer says the album started a process that grew to become a &quot;gulf between albums and singles, between rock or pop&quot; that &quot;shape[d] British music for decades&quot;.

===Development of subgenres===

The album coincided with rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&#x27;s development into a variety of new styles, a process in which the Beatles&#x27; influence ensured them a pre-eminent role. Andrew Loog Oldham, the Rolling Stones&#x27; manager and producer at the time, has described &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as &quot;the album that changed the musical world we lived in then to the one we still live in today&quot;. &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; launched what Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar called &quot;the great sitar explosion&quot;, as the Indian string instrument became a popular feature in raga rock and for many pop artists seeking to add an exotic quality to their music. The harpsichord-like solo on &quot;In My Life&quot; led to a wave of baroque rock recordings. &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was also the release that encouraged many folk-music aficionados to embrace pop. Folk singer Roy Harper recalled: &quot;They&#x27;d come onto my turf, got there before me, and they were kings of it, overnight. We&#x27;d all been outflanked...&quot;

Author George Case, writing in his book &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot;, identifies &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as &quot;the authentic beginning of the psychedelic era&quot;. Music journalist Mark Ellen similarly credits the album with having &quot;sow[ed] the seeds of psychedelia&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kubernik/RBP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while Christgau says that &quot;psychedelia starts here.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in July 1966, Lillian Roxon reported on the new trend for psychedelia-themed clubs and events in the US and said that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was &quot;the classic psychedelic album now played at all the psychedelic discotheques&quot;. She attributed pop&#x27;s recent embrace of psychedelia and &quot;many of the strange new sounds now in records&quot; to the LP&#x27;s influence.

In Myers&#x27; view, the Capitol release &quot;changed the direction of American rock&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mochari/Inc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the ongoing process of reciprocal influence between the band and US folk rock acts, the Beatles went on to inspire the San Francisco music scene. Recalling the album&#x27;s popularity in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, where Jefferson Airplane were based, journalist Charles Perry said: &quot;You could party hop all night and hear nothing but &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.&quot; Perry also wrote that &quot;More than ever the Beatles were the soundtrack of the Haight-Ashbury, Berkeley and the whole circuit&quot;, where pre-hippie students suspected that the album was inspired by drugs.

Citing a quantitative study of tempos in music from the 1960s, Walter Everett identifies &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as a work that was &quot;made more to be thought about than danced to&quot;, and an album that &quot;began a far-reaching trend&quot; in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music. While music historians typically credit &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as the birth of progressive rock, Everett and Bill Martin recognise &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as the inspiration for many of the bands working in that genre from the early 1970s.

===Appearances on best-album lists and further recognition===
&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was voted fifth in Paul Gambaccini&#x27;s 1978 book &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice: Top 200 Albums&quot;, based on submissions from a panel of 47 critics and broadcasters including Richard Williams, Christgau and Marcus. In the first edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, in 1994, it was ranked at number 10, and in 1998 it was voted the 39th greatest album of all time in the first &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll, conducted by HMV and Channel 4. It was listed at number 34 in the third edition of Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, published in 2000.

Since 2001, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; has appeared in critics&#x27; best-albums-of-all-time lists compiled by VH1 (at number 6), &quot;Mojo&quot; (number 27) and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (number 5). It was among &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s selection of the &quot;All-Time 100 Albums&quot; in 2006 and was favoured over &quot;Revolver&quot; in Chris Smith&#x27;s book &quot;101 Albums That Changed Popular Music&quot; three years later. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; again placed it at number 5 on the magazine&#x27;s revised list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In September 2020, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was ranked at number 35 on the same publication&#x27;s new list.

&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; appeared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2014 list of the &quot;40 Most Groundbreaking Albums of All Time&quot;, where the editors concluded: &quot;You can say this represents &#x27;maturity,&#x27; call it &#x27;art&#x27; or credit it for moving rock away from singles to album-length statements – but regardless &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; accelerated popular music&#x27;s creative arms race, driving competitors like the Stones, the Beach Boys and Dylan to dismantle expectations and create new ones.&quot; Three years later, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it at number 46 on the website&#x27;s &quot;200 Best Albums of the 1960s&quot;. In his commentary with the entry, Ian Cohen wrote: &quot;Every Beatles album fundamentally shaped how pop music is understood, so &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is one of the most important records ever made, by default... Even in 2017, whenever a pop singer makes a serious turn, or an anointed serious band says they&#x27;ve learned to embrace pop, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; can&#x27;t help but enter the conversation.&quot;

In 2000, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, an award bestowed by the American Recording Academy &quot;to honor recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old&quot;. The album has been the subject of multi-artist tribute albums such as &quot;This Bird Has Flown&quot; and &quot;Rubber Folk&quot;. Writing in December 2015, Ilan Mochari of &quot;Inc.&quot; magazine commented on the unusual aspect of a pop album&#x27;s 50th anniversary being celebrated, and added: &quot;Over the next several years, you can bet you&#x27;ll read about the 50th anniversary of many other albums – thematic volumes composed by bands or songwriters in the tradition &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; established. All of which is to say: &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; sixth studio album, was the record that launched a thousand ships.&quot;

==Compact disc reissues==
&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was first released on compact disc on 30 April 1987, with the fourteen-song UK track line-up now the international standard. As with &quot;Help!&quot;, the album features a contemporary stereo digital remix prepared by George Martin. Martin had expressed concern to EMI over the original 1965 stereo mix, claiming it sounded &quot;very woolly, and not at all what I thought should be a good issue&quot;. He went back to the original four-track tapes and remixed them for stereo.

A newly remastered version of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, again using the 1987 Martin remix, was released worldwide as part of the reissue of the entire Beatles catalogue on 9 September 2009. The album is available both as an individual CD release and as part of the &quot;Beatles (The Original Studio Recordings)&quot; box set. The accompanying &quot;Beatles in Mono&quot; box set contains two versions of the album: the original mono mix and the 1965 stereo mix.

The Capitol version was re-released in 2006, first as part of the &quot;Capitol Albums, Volume 2&quot; box set, using original mixes of the Capitol album, and then in 2014, individually and in the box set &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot;.

==Track listing==
===In all markets except North America===

===Original North American release===

Compared to the UK/worldwide release, the original North American release of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; drops four tracks (&quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;What Goes On&quot; and &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;) and adds two others (&quot;I&#x27;ve Just Seen A Face&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot;). In addition, the mixes (supervised by Dave Dexter Jr.) are in some cases slightly different from the UK/worldwide versions. Notably, the North American stereo version of &quot;I&#x27;m Looking Through You&quot; contains two false guitar starts not heard elsewhere, while &quot;The Word&quot; also differs from the UK version, with several different and additional vocal parts, and the panning treatment given to one of the percussion parts.

<text>Modern Times is a 1936 American part-talkie comedy film produced, written and directed by Charlie Chaplin. In Chaplin&#x27;s last performance as the iconic Little Tramp, his character struggles to survive in the modern, industrialized world. The film also stars Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman, Tiny Sandford and Chester Conklin.

&quot;Modern Times&quot; has won many awards and honors, and is widely considered one of the greatest films ever. It was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
The Tramp works on an assembly line, where he suffers greatly due to the stress and pace of the repetitive work. He eventually suffers a nervous breakdown and runs amok, getting stuck within a machine and throwing the factory into chaos; he is then sent to the hospital. Following his recovery, the now-unemployed Tramp is mistakenly arrested in a Communist demonstration. In jail, he accidentally ingests smuggled cocaine, and in his subsequent delirium, he avoids being put back in his cell. When he returns, he stumbles upon a jailbreak and knocks the convicts unconscious for which he is hailed as a hero and given special treatment. When he is informed that he will soon be released due to his heroic actions, he argues unsuccessfully that he prefers life in jail.

Upon release, he applies for a new job with a shipbuilder but leaves after causing an accident. Soon after, he runs into an orphaned girl, Ellen, who is fleeing the police after stealing a loaf of bread. Determined to go back to jail and to save her from arrest, the Tramp tells the police that he is the thief and asks to be arrested, but a witness reveals his deception and he is freed. He then eats an enormous amount of food at a cafeteria without paying to get arrested, and once again encounters Ellen in a paddy wagon after he is put in it. It soon crashes, however, and she convinces him to escape with her. The Tramp then gets a job as a night watchman at a department store, and encounters three burglars led by &quot;Big Bill,&quot; a fellow worker from the factory, who explains that they are hungry and desperate. After sharing drinks with them, he wakes up the next morning during opening hours and is arrested once again for failing to call the police on the burglars and for sleeping in the store&#x27;s clothes on a desk, shocking a customer and the storekeeper.

Days later, Ellen takes him to a run-down shack to live in. The next morning, he reads about an old factory&#x27;s re-opening and lands a job as a mechanic&#x27;s assistant. The other workers then suddenly decide to go on strike, and tell the Tramp to leave with them. Outside the factory, he accidentally launches a brick at a policeman and is arrested again.

He is released two weeks later, and learns that Ellen is now a café dancer. She gets him a job as a singer and waiter, but he goes about his duties clumsily. During his floor show, he loses his cuffs, which bear the lyrics to his song, but he rescues the act by improvising the lyrics using gibberish and by pantomiming. When police arrive to arrest Ellen for her earlier escape, the two are forced to flee again, and Ellen despairs that their struggles are all pointless, but the Tramp reassures her. At a bright dawn, they walk down the road towards an uncertain but hopeful future.

==Cast==
==Production==
During a European tour promoting &quot;City Lights&quot;, Chaplin got the inspiration for &quot;Modern Times&quot; from both the lamentable conditions of the continent through the Great Depression, along with a conversation with Mahatma Gandhi in which they discussed modern technology. Chaplin did not understand why Gandhi generally opposed it, though he granted that &quot;machinery with only consideration of profit&quot; had put people out of work and ruined lives.

Chaplin began preparing the film in 1934 as his first &quot;talkie&quot;, and went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with some sound scenes. However, he soon abandoned these attempts and reverted to a silent format with synchronized sound effects and sparse dialogue. The dialogue experiments confirmed his long-standing conviction that the universal appeal of his &quot;Little Tramp&quot; character would be lost if the character ever spoke on screen. Most of the film was shot at &quot;silent speed&quot;, 18 frames per second, which when projected at &quot;sound speed&quot;, 24 frames per second, made the slapstick action appear even more frenetic. The duration of filming was long for the time, beginning on October 11, 1934, and ending on August 30, 1935.

Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance has noted: “Chaplin recognized that &quot;Modern Times&quot; was the valedictory for the Tramp and deliberately included many gags and sequences as a loving farewell to the character and an homage to the visual comedy tradition.&quot;

This film also famously uses matte painting in the harrowing skating scene where Charlie skates blindfolded, not realizing he is constantly near the edge and very likely could fall down. The illusory drop has been matte-painted, and Chaplin was never in actual danger while filming this scene in reality, he skated on a plain floor, with a ledge for him to discern when to stop. This can be observed in the fact that, at one moment, Chaplin&#x27;s back wheel briefly disappeared behind the painting. This most likely escaped the eyes of Chaplin, which could be the reason he left it in.

The reference to drugs seen in the prison sequence is somewhat daring for the time (since the production code, established in 1930 and enforced since 1934, forbade the depiction of illegal drug use in films); Chaplin had made drug references before in one of his most famous short films, &quot;Easy Street&quot;, released in 1917.

==Music==
According to the official documents, the music score was composed by Chaplin himself, and arranged with the assistance of Alfred Newman, who had collaborated with Chaplin on the music score of his previous film &quot;City Lights&quot;. Newman and Chaplin had a falling out near the end of the &quot;Modern Times&quot; soundtrack recording sessions, leading to Newman&#x27;s angry departure.

The romance theme was later given lyrics, and became the pop standard &quot;Smile&quot;, first recorded by Nat King Cole. A cover of this song by Jimmy Durante was also used in the trailer for the 2019 film &quot;Joker&quot;, in which the lead character also watches scenes from a showing of &quot;Modern Times&quot; after sneaking into a movie theatre.

&quot;Modern Times&quot; was the first film where Chaplin&#x27;s voice is heard as he performs Léo Daniderff&#x27;s comical song &quot;Je cherche après Titine&quot;. Chaplin&#x27;s version is also known as &quot;The Nonsense Song&quot;, as his character sings it in gibberish. The lyrics are nonsensical but appear to contain words from French and Italian; the use of deliberately half-intelligible wording for comic effect points the way towards Adenoid Hynkel&#x27;s speeches in &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;.

According to film composer David Raksin, Chaplin wrote the music as a young man wanting to make a name for himself. He would sit, often in the washroom, humming tunes and telling Raksin to &quot;take this down&quot;. Raksin&#x27;s job was to turn the humming into a score and create timings and synchronization that fit the situations. Chaplin was a violinist and had some musical knowledge, but he was not an orchestrator and was unfamiliar with synchronization. Along with Edward B. Powell, Raksin did receive screen credit for the music arrangements. Raksin later created scores for films including &quot;Laura&quot; and &quot;The Day After&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Modern Times&quot; is often hailed as one of Chaplin&#x27;s greatest achievements, and it remains one of his most popular films. It holds an approval rating of 98% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 108 reviews, with a weighted average of 9.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A slapstick skewering of industrialized America, &quot;Modern Times&quot; is as politically incisive as it is laugh-out-loud hilarious.&quot; Metacritic reports an aggregated score of 96/100 based on 4 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Naming it the Best Film of the 30s Decade, &quot;Flickside&quot; writes: &quot;Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Modern Times&quot; is a thoughtful critique on the anxieties of modernization dealt with pathos and humour.&quot; Contemporary reviews were very positive. Frank Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;&#x27;Modern Times&#x27; has still the same old Charlie, the lovable little fellow whose hands and feet and prankish eyebrows can beat an irresistible tattoo upon an audience&#x27;s funnybone or hold it still, taut beneath the spell of human tragedy ... Time has not changed his genius.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;grand fun and sound entertainment&quot;. &quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote: &quot;Charlie Chaplin has scored one of his greatest triumphs.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Chaplin &quot;manufactures some superb laughs ... In all, it&#x27;s a rambling sketch, a little at loose ends at times, sometimes rather slight in effect, and now and then secure in its rich, old-fashioned funniness.&quot; Burns Mantle called the film &quot;another hilariously rowdy success&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1936, Graham Greene strongly praised the film, noting that, although there had always been a bit of a dated feel to his previous works, Chaplin &quot;has at last definitely entered the contemporary scene&quot;. Greene noted that, whereas prior Chaplin films had featured &quot;fair and featureless&quot; heroines, the casting of Paulette Goddard suggested that his female characters might be presented with more personality than previously. He also voiced concern that the film would be considered to be a Communist film when in reality Chaplin&#x27;s message was predominantly apolitical: &quot;[Chaplin] presents, he doesn&#x27;t offer political solutions.&quot;

French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty named their journal, &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot;, after it.

&quot;Modern Times&quot; earned $1.8 million in North American theatrical rentals during its release, becoming one of the top-grossing films of 1936. It was the most popular film at the British box office in 1935–36.

The iconic depiction of Chaplin working frantically to keep up with an assembly line inspired later comedy routines including Disney&#x27;s &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; (Donald Duck alternately assembling artillery shells and saluting portraits of Adolf Hitler) and an episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; titled &quot;Job Switching&quot; (Lucy and Ethel trying to keep up with an ever-increasing volume of chocolate candies, eventually stuffing them in their mouths, hats, and blouses). The opening of a fantasy sequence in the film, in which the unemployed factory worker trips over a footstool upon entering the living room of his &quot;dream home&quot; with the Gamin, inspired a similar opening to &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;.

This was Chaplin&#x27;s first overtly political-themed film, and its unflattering portrayal of industrial society generated controversy in some quarters upon its initial release. Writing in &quot;The Liberal News&quot;, the official magazine of the British Liberal Party, in October 1936, Willoughby Dewar observed that &quot;Modern Times&quot; &quot;should be seen by every Young Liberal. It is, among other things, a piece of first-class Liberal propaganda.&quot; In Nazi Germany, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels banned the film from being shown because of its alleged advocacy of communism.

The film exhibits slight similarities to a lesser known 1931 French film directed by René Clair entitled &quot;À nous la liberté&quot; (&quot;Liberty for Us&quot;) – the assembly line sequence is an instance in that both films depict it, but in different ways. The German film company Tobis Film, hungry for cash, sued Chaplin following the film&#x27;s release but to no avail. They sued again after World War II (considered revenge for Chaplin&#x27;s anti-Nazi statements in &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;). This time, they settled with Chaplin out of court. Clair, a friend and huge admirer of Chaplin who was flattered that the film icon would depict a similar subject, was deeply embarrassed that Tobis Film would sue Chaplin, and was never part of the case.

The film did attract criticism for being almost completely silent. Chaplin feared that the mystery and romanticism of the Tramp character would be ruined if he spoke, and also that it would alienate his fans in non-English speaking territories. His future films, however, would be fully fledged &quot;talkies&quot; – although without the character of the Little Tramp.

Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance has written of the reception and legacy of this classic comedy: &quot;Modern Times&quot; is perhaps more meaningful now than at any time since its first release. The twentieth-century theme of the film, farsighted for its timethe struggle to eschew alienation and preserve humanity in a modern, mechanized worldprofoundly reflects issues facing the twenty-first century. The Tramp&#x27;s travails in &quot;Modern Times&quot; and the comedic mayhem that ensues should provide strength and comfort to all who feel like helpless cogs in a world beyond control. Through its universal themes and comic inventiveness, Modern Times remains one of Chaplin&#x27;s greatest and most enduring works. Perhaps more important, it is the Tramp&#x27;s finale, a tribute to Chaplin&#x27;s most beloved character and the silent-film era he commanded for a generation.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 1998: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Movies – #81
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Laughs – #33
* 2007: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – #78

The film was voted at No. 12 on the list of &quot;The 100 greatest comedies of all time&quot; by a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017. In 2021 the film ranked 49th on Time Out magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 best movies of all time&quot;.

The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of &quot;Art&quot;.

==Restoration==
A digitally restored version of the film was released in 2003. The French company MK2 searched the world for good copies of the original footage, cut them together and processed each of the 126,000 frames, removing scratches and dust, and ensuring optimal image stability and balanced black and white tone levels. The restored version was first shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003.
In 2013 Cineteca di Bologna and the Criterion Collection effected further digital improvements of the 2003 version, as noted in a preface ahead of the title.

<doc id="74964" wikidata="Q173356" url="?curid=74964" title="Gauss's law">
<text>In physics (specifically electromagnetism), Gauss&#x27;s law, also known as Gauss&#x27;s flux theorem (or sometimes Gauss&#x27;s theorem), is one of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. It is an application of the divergence theorem, and it relates the distribution of electric charge to the resulting electric field.

== Definition ==
In its integral form, it states that the flux of the electric field out of an arbitrary closed surface is proportional to the electric charge enclosed by the surface, irrespective of how that charge is distributed. Even though the law alone is insufficient to determine the electric field across a surface enclosing any charge distribution, this may be possible in cases where symmetry mandates uniformity of the field. Where no such symmetry exists, Gauss&#x27;s law can be used in its differential form, which states that the divergence of the electric field is proportional to the local density of charge.

The law was first formulated by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1773, followed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1835, both in the context of the attraction of ellipsoids. It is one of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, which forms the basis of classical electrodynamics. Gauss&#x27;s law can be used to derive Coulomb&#x27;s law, and vice versa.
==Qualitative description==

In words, Gauss&#x27;s law states:
:The net electric flux through any hypothetical closed surface is equal to times the net electric charge enclosed within that closed surface. The closed surface is also referred to as Gaussian surface.

Gauss&#x27;s law has a close mathematical similarity with a number of laws in other areas of physics, such as Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism and Gauss&#x27;s law for gravity. In fact, any inverse-square law can be formulated in a way similar to Gauss&#x27;s law: for example, Gauss&#x27;s law itself is essentially equivalent to Coulomb&#x27;s law, and Gauss&#x27;s law for gravity is essentially equivalent to Newton&#x27;s law of gravity, both of which are inverse-square laws.

The law can be expressed mathematically using vector calculus in integral form and differential form; both are equivalent since they are related by the divergence theorem, also called Gauss&#x27;s theorem. Each of these forms in turn can also be expressed two ways: In terms of a relation between the electric field and the total electric charge, or in terms of the electric displacement field and the &quot;free&quot; electric charge.

==Equation involving the field==

Gauss&#x27;s law can be stated using either the electric field or the electric displacement field . This section shows some of the forms with ; the form with is below, as are other forms with .

===Integral form===
Gauss&#x27;s law may be expressed as:

formula_1

where is the electric flux through a closed surface enclosing any volume , is the total charge enclosed within , and is the electric constant. The electric flux is defined as a surface integral of the electric field:

where is the electric field, is a vector representing an infinitesimal element of area of the surface, and represents the dot product of two vectors.

In a curved spacetime, the flux of an electromagnetic field through a closed surface is expressed as

where formula_2 is the speed of light; formula_3 denotes the time components of the electromagnetic tensor; formula_4 is the determinant of metric tensor; formula_5 is an orthonormal element of the two-dimensional surface surrounding the charge formula_6; indices formula_7 and do not match each other.

Since the flux is defined as an &quot;integral&quot; of the electric field, this expression of Gauss&#x27;s law is called the &quot;integral form&quot;.

In problems involving conductors set at known potentials, the potential away from them is obtained by solving Laplace&#x27;s equation, either analytically or numerically. The electric field is then calculated as the potential&#x27;s negative gradient. Gauss&#x27;s law makes it possible to find the distribution of electric charge: The charge in any given region of the conductor can be deduced by integrating the electric field to find the flux through a small box whose sides are perpendicular to the conductor&#x27;s surface and by noting that the electric field is perpendicular to the surface, and zero inside the conductor.

The reverse problem, when the electric charge distribution is known and the electric field must be computed, is much more difficult. The total flux through a given surface gives little information about the electric field, and can go in and out of the surface in arbitrarily complicated patterns.

An exception is if there is some symmetry in the problem, which mandates that the electric field passes through the surface in a uniform way. Then, if the total flux is known, the field itself can be deduced at every point. Common examples of symmetries which lend themselves to Gauss&#x27;s law include: cylindrical symmetry, planar symmetry, and spherical symmetry. See the article Gaussian surface for examples where these symmetries are exploited to compute electric fields.

===Differential form===

By the divergence theorem, Gauss&#x27;s law can alternatively be written in the &quot;differential form&quot;:
formula_8

where is the divergence of the electric field, is the vacuum permittivity and is the total volume charge density (charge per unit volume).

===Equivalence of integral and differential forms===
The integral and differential forms are mathematically equivalent, by the divergence theorem. Here is the argument more specifically.

==Equation involving the field==
===Free, bound, and total charge===
The electric charge that arises in the simplest textbook situations would be classified as &quot;free charge&quot;—for example, the charge which is transferred in static electricity, or the charge on a capacitor plate. In contrast, &quot;bound charge&quot; arises only in the context of dielectric (polarizable) materials. (All materials are polarizable to some extent.) When such materials are placed in an external electric field, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms, but shift a microscopic distance in response to the field, so that they&#x27;re more on one side of the atom than the other. All these microscopic displacements add up to give a macroscopic net charge distribution, and this constitutes the &quot;bound charge&quot;.

Although microscopically all charge is fundamentally the same, there are often practical reasons for wanting to treat bound charge differently from free charge. The result is that the more fundamental Gauss&#x27;s law, in terms of (above), is sometimes put into the equivalent form below, which is in terms of and the free charge only.

===Integral form===

This formulation of Gauss&#x27;s law states the total charge form:

formula_9

where is the -field flux through a surface which encloses a volume , and is the free charge contained in . The flux is defined analogously to the flux of the electric field through :

===Differential form===

The differential form of Gauss&#x27;s law, involving free charge only, states:
formula_10

where is the divergence of the electric displacement field, and is the free electric charge density.

==Equivalence of total and free charge statements==

==Equation for linear materials==

In homogeneous, isotropic, nondispersive, linear materials, there is a simple relationship between and :

formula_11

where is the permittivity of the material. For the case of vacuum (aka free space), . Under these circumstances, Gauss&#x27;s law modifies to

formula_12

for the integral form, and

formula_13

for the differential form.

==Relation to Coulomb&#x27;s law==

===Deriving Gauss&#x27;s law from Coulomb&#x27;s law===

Strictly speaking, Gauss&#x27;s law cannot be derived from Coulomb&#x27;s law alone, since Coulomb&#x27;s law gives the electric field due to an individual, electrostatic point charge only. However, Gauss&#x27;s law &quot;can&quot; be proven from Coulomb&#x27;s law if it is assumed, in addition, that the electric field obeys the superposition principle. The superposition principle states that the resulting field is the vector sum of fields generated by each particle (or the integral, if the charges are distributed smoothly in space).

{|\mathbf{r}|^3}\right) = 4\pi \delta(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;
where is the Dirac delta function, the result is
formula_14

Using the &quot;sifting property&quot; of the Dirac delta function, we arrive at
formula_15
which is the differential form of Gauss&#x27;s law, as desired.

Since Coulomb&#x27;s law only applies to stationary charges, there is no reason to expect Gauss&#x27;s law to hold for moving charges based on this derivation alone. In fact, Gauss&#x27;s law does hold for moving charges, and, in this respect, Gauss&#x27;s law is more general than Coulomb&#x27;s law.

===Deriving Coulomb&#x27;s law from Gauss&#x27;s law===

Strictly speaking, Coulomb&#x27;s law cannot be derived from Gauss&#x27;s law alone, since Gauss&#x27;s law does not give any information regarding the curl of (see Helmholtz decomposition and Faraday&#x27;s law). However, Coulomb&#x27;s law &quot;can&quot; be proven from Gauss&#x27;s law if it is assumed, in addition, that the electric field from a point charge is spherically symmetric (this assumption, like Coulomb&#x27;s law itself, is exactly true if the charge is stationary, and approximately true if the charge is in motion).

\cdot\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;
where is a unit vector pointing radially away from the charge. Again by spherical symmetry, points in the radial direction, and so we get
formula_16
which is essentially equivalent to Coulomb&#x27;s law. Thus the inverse-square law dependence of the electric field in Coulomb&#x27;s law follows from Gauss&#x27;s law.

<text>Morocco is a 1930 American pre-Code romantic drama film directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich, and Adolphe Menjou. Based on the 1927 novel &quot;Amy Jolly&quot; (the on-screen credits state: from the play &#x27;Amy Jolly&#x27;) by Benno Vigny and adapted by Jules Furthman, the film is about a cabaret singer and a Legionnaire who fall in love during the Rif War, and whose relationship is complicated by his womanizing and the appearance of a rich man who is also in love with her. The film is famous for a scene in which Dietrich performs a song dressed in a man&#x27;s tailcoat and kisses another woman (to the embarrassment of the latter), both of which were considered scandalous for the period.

Dietrich was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, von Sternberg for Best Director, Hans Dreier for Best Art Direction, and Lee Garmes for Best Cinematography. In 1992, &quot;Morocco&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In Mogador, Morocco in the late 1920s, a unit of the French Foreign Legion returns from a campaign. Among the legionnaires is Private Tom Brown. Meanwhile, on a ship bound for Mogador is the disillusioned nightclub singer Amy Jolly. Wealthy La Bessière tries to make her acquaintance, but she rebuffs him.

Amy becomes the headliner at a nightclub. After a performance, she sells apples to audience members, including La Bessière and Brown. When Amy gives the latter his &quot;change&quot;, she slips him her key.

On the way to Amy&#x27;s house, Tom encounters Adjudant Caesar&#x27;s wife. She clearly has a clandestine relationship with him, which she desires to maintain, but Tom rejects her. He enters Amy&#x27;s house and the two become acquainted. Amy is embittered with life and men after repeated betrayals, and asks if Tom can restore her faith in men. He answers that he is the wrong man for that. Unwilling to risk heartbreak yet again, she asks him to leave before anything serious happens.

Back in the street, Tom encounters Caesar&#x27;s wife again, while her husband watches undetected from the shadows. Meanwhile, Amy changes her mind and comes after Tom, who heads back with her to her house. Madame Caesar hires two ruffians to attack Tom, but he manages to seriously wound both.

The next day, Tom is brought before Caesar, who is Tom&#x27;s commanding officer, for injuring the two natives. Amy helps Tom&#x27;s case by testifying that he was attacked, but Caesar makes Tom aware that he knows about Tom&#x27;s involvement with his wife. La Bessière, whose affections for Amy continue unabated, knows of her feelings for Tom and offers to use his influence to lighten Tom&#x27;s punishment. Instead of a court-martial, Tom is reassigned to a detachment commanded by Caesar that is leaving soon for Amalfa Pass. Suspecting that Caesar intends to rid himself of his romantic rival while they are gone, Tom decides to desert and run away with Amy.

Tom goes to Amy&#x27;s nightclub dressing room. He overhears La Bessière offer to marry Amy, and her politely reject the proposal, before knocking on the door. La Bessière leaves Amy alone with Tom, who tells her that, if she will join him, he will desert and board a freighter to Europe. She agrees to go along and asks Tom to wait while she performs. Once he is alone, he notices a lavish bracelet that La Bessière has given to Amy. Though he has fallen in love with her, Tom decides Amy would be better off with a rich man than with a poor Legionnaire. He writes on the mirror, &quot;I changed my mind. Good luck!&quot; and leaves.

In the morning, Amy, after a drunken, miserable night, arrives in the town square with La Bessière so she can bid Tom farewell. She asks La Bessière about some women following the company, remarking that the women must be mad. He responds, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. You see, they love their men.&quot;

On the way to Amalfa Pass, Tom&#x27;s detachment runs into a machine-gun nest. Caesar orders Tom to deal with it, and Tom suspects it is a suicide mission. To his surprise, Caesar decides to accompany him. After drawing his pistol (apparently to kill Tom), Caesar is shot and killed by the enemy.

Back in Mogador, Amy accepts La Bessière&#x27;s marriage proposal and tries to make herself love him, but she still pines for Tom. At an engagement party, she hears the return of the remains of Tom&#x27;s detachment. She leaves the party and is told Tom was wounded and left behind to recuperate in a hospital. She informs La Bessière that she must go to Tom, and, wanting only her happiness, he drives her to the hospital. It turns out Tom had been faking an injury to avoid combat and, when this was discovered, he was assigned to a new unit in the Legion. Amy goes to a bar where Tom was, briefly talks with him, and when he leaves, finds he carved into the table the name &quot;Amy&quot;, showing he still loves her, which surprises her.

Next morning, Amy and La Bessière watch Tom&#x27;s new unit readying for their march. Tom and Amy briefly speak. The two wave goodbye. When Amy sees a handful of women following the legionnaires, she impulsively leaves La Bessière, kicks off her high-heeled shoes, joins them, following Tom into the desert.

==Background==
Even before Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; was released to international acclaim in 1930, Paramount Pictures took a keen interest in its new star, Marlene Dietrich. When the Berlin production was completed in January, Sternberg departed Germany before its premiere on April 1, confident his work would be a success. Legend has it that Dietrich included a copy of author Benno Vigny&#x27;s story &quot;Amy Jolly&quot; in a going-away gift package to Sternberg when he sailed for America. He and screenwriter Jules Furthman would write a script for &quot;Morocco&quot; based on the Vigny story.

On the basis of test footage Sternberg provided from the yet unreleased &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;, producer B. P. Schulberg agreed to bring Dietrich to Hollywood in February 1930 under a two-picture contract. When she arrived in the United States, Sternberg welcomed her with gifts, including a green Rolls-Royce Phantom II, which featured in some scenes of &quot;Morocco&quot;.

Dietrich &quot;was subjected to the full power of Paramount&#x27;s public relations machine&quot;, launching her into &quot;international stardom&quot; &quot;before&quot; American moviegoers had seen her as Lola Lola in &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;, which appeared in U.S. theaters in 1931.

==Production==
The character of Amy was toned down considerably from the novel. As in the book, in the film the name &quot;aimee jolie&quot; (French for &quot;beloved and pretty&quot;) is meant ironically as Amy is portrayed as a fallen star past her prime, a desperately lonely woman lost in despair who has gone to Morocco to die. However, in the book, the character of Amy was a prostitute and a drug addict, both of which were unacceptable even under the looser censorship in 1930 Hollywood and these aspects of Amy&#x27;s character were removed from the film during the script-writing. Likewise, the ending was changed from the book to the film. In the book, Amy abandons Tom and at the conclusion of the novel, boards a ship to Buenos Aires. Sternberg disliked the ending in the book, and gave the film the more romantic ending where Amy chooses to be with Brown by going with him into the Sahara.

Sternberg&#x27;s depiction of &quot;picturesque&quot; Morocco elicited a favorable response from the Moroccan government, which ran announcements in &quot;The New York Times&quot; inviting American tourists to enjoy the country &quot;just as Gary Cooper [was seduced by the] unforgettable landscapes and engaging people.&quot; However, the film was filmed entirely in southern California, and Sternberg felt compelled to personally reassure the Pasha of Marrakesh that &quot;Morocco&quot; had not been shot in his domain.

Cinematographer Lee Garmes and Sternberg (himself a skilled camera technician) developed the distinctive lighting methods that served to enhance Dietrich&#x27;s best facial features, while obscuring her slightly bulbous nose.

According to Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies, Cooper and Sternberg did not get along. Sternberg filmed so as to make Cooper look up at Dietrich, emphasizing her at his expense. Cooper complained to his studio bosses and got it stopped. Cooper greatly disliked Sternberg, complaining that he received little in the way of direction from him about how to play Brown. It was open knowledge on the set that Sternberg and Dietrich were lovers, and Cooper felt that he was very much a secondary figure in the film as Sternberg devoted all of his attention to Dietrich. As a way of compensation, Cooper brought his mistress, the Mexican actress Lupe Vélez onto the set and went out of his way to demonstratively show his affections by having her sit on his lap between takes and passionately kissing her as often as possible.

Shooting for &quot;Morocco&quot; was completed in August 1930.

The final scene of &quot;Morocco&quot; is recreated in the 1946 Mexican film &quot;Enamorada&quot;, directed by Emilio Fernández.

==Radio Adaptation==
&quot;Morocco&quot; was adapted as a one-hour radio broadcast by the &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on June 1, 1936 (under the title &quot;The Legionnaire and the Lady&quot;), with Marlene Dietrich reprising her film role, and with Clark Gable assuming the role of the Legionnaire. This was &quot;Lux Radio&#x27;s&quot; debut broadcast from Hollywood, following its move from New York City.

== Home media ==
Morocco was released by Universal Studios in DVD on April 25, 2011, under label Universal Vault Series.

==Reception==
Premiering in New York City on December 6, 1930, &quot;Morocco&quot;″s success at the box office was &quot;immediate and impressive&quot;.

Accolades for the film were issued by Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein, screenwriter Robert E. Sherwood, and filmmaker Charles Chaplin, who said of the film, &quot;yes, [Sternberg] is an artist ... it is his best film [to date].&quot;

In a contemporary review, the French critic Michel Vauclaire wrote: &quot;Every year in the US, half a dozen novels are published about the Legion, in general very severe and quite fantastic. It&#x27;s obviously on this sort of fiction that Sternberg has based his research. Perhaps the film reflects the American public&#x27;s idea of the Legionaries. In France, despite its dramatic pretensions, it will raise a laugh&quot;.

The film garnered Academy Award nominations for Best Director (Sternberg), Best Actress (Dietrich), Best Art Direction (Hans Dreier), and Best Cinematography (Lee Garmes), though it did not win any awards.

Titled &quot;The Legionnaire and the Lady&quot;, Marlene Dietrich and Clark Gable performed the story on radio as the first Lux Radio Theatre broadcast on June 1, 1936.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this movie as one of his 100 favorite films.

==Box Office==
Director von Sternberg reported in his 1965 autobiography that producer Adolph Zukor informed him that Paramount “had been saved from bankruptcy” by the box office success of &quot;Morocco&quot;.

==Retrospective appraisal==
Charles Silver, curator at the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s Department of Film, offers this assessment of &quot;Morocco&quot;:

==Theme==

With &quot;Morocco&quot;, Sternberg examines the &quot;interchange of masculine and feminine characteristics&quot; in a &quot;genuine interplay between male and female.&quot;

===Tom Brown===
The character of Tom Brown was portrayed as an example of a lost soul, a tough, jaded American serving in the French Foreign Legion with a name that was so bland that it was clearly a pseudonym. In the film, it is strongly implied that Brown was attempting to escape a painful past by enlisting in the French Foreign Legion, which famously &quot;asks no questions&quot; about an applicant&#x27;s background. Likewise, Brown seems to have no future beyond fighting for a cause that he does not believe in Morocco and seemingly sleeping with every women in sight. It is only when he meets Amy that he finds someone that he actually cares about and a reason to be hopeful about the future. Most notably, Brown who was portrayed as an entirely cynical, selfish character prior to meeting Amy displays an altruistic side as he encourages Amy to marry the rich man La Bessière who is more capable of supporting her financially than he is under his private&#x27;s salary. Despite his efforts to push Amy out of his life, when he is alone, he carves the &quot;Amy Jolly&quot; onto the table along with a heart.

===&quot;When Love Dies&quot;: Dietrich&#x27;s male impersonation===
Dietrich&#x27;s &quot;butch performance&quot; dressed in &quot;top hat, white tie and tails&quot; includes a &quot;mock seduction&quot; of a pretty female cabaret patron, whom Dietrich &quot;outrages with a kiss.&quot; Dietrich&#x27;s costume simultaneously mocks the pretensions of one lover (Menjou&#x27;s La Bessière) and serves as an invitation to a handsome soldier-of-fortune (Cooper&#x27;s Tom Brown), the two men being presented by Sternberg as contrasting conceptions of masculinity.&quot;

This famous sequence provides an insight into Dietrich&#x27;s character, Amy Jolly, as well as the director himself: &quot;Dietrich&#x27;s impersonation is an adventure, an act of bravado that subtly alters her conception of herself as a woman, and what begins as self-expression ends in self-sacrifice, perhaps the path also of Sternberg as an artist.&quot;

=== La Bessière&#x27;s humiliation===
Dietrich&#x27;s devoted suitor, Menjou&#x27;s La Bessière, &quot;part stoic, part , part satanist&quot;, is destined to lose the object of his desire. Menjou&#x27;s response to Dietrich&#x27;s desertion reveals the nature of the man and presents a key thematic element of the film:

In Menjou&#x27;s pained politeness of expression is engraved the age-old tension between Apollonian and Dionysian demands of art, between pride in restraint and passion in excess ... when Dietrich kisses him goodbye, Menjou clutches her wrist in one last spasmodic reflex of passion, but the other hand retains its poise at his side, the gestures of form and feeling thus conflicting to the very end of the drama.

The La Bessière character has autobiographical overtones for Sternberg, as Menjou has looks and mannerisms that resemble the director. Critic Andrew Sarris observed: &quot;Sternberg has never been as close to any character as he is to this elegant expatriate.&quot;

===Dietrich&#x27;s high-heeled march into the dunes===
&quot;(There has been the criticism that an effect of a trek across the desert in high heels is unrealistic and while not noted would reach a definition of camp. The observation is technically correct. Dietrich&#x27;s character &quot;does&quot; set out in her society shoes but within yards breaks her stride and removes them.)&quot;&lt;br&gt;

The &quot;absurdity&quot; of the closing sequence, in which Dietrich, &quot;sets out into the desert sands on spike heels in search of Gary Cooper&quot;, was noted by critics at the time of the film&#x27;s release. The image, however odd, is part of the &quot;dream décor&quot; that abandoned &quot;documentary certification&quot; to create &quot;a world of illusions.&quot; As Sarris points out, &quot;The complaint that a woman in high heels would not walk off into the desert is nonetheless meaningless. A dream does not require endurance, only the will to act.&quot;

Film historian Charles Silver considers the final scene as one that &quot;no artist today would dare attempt&quot;:

==Accolades==
The film was ranked 83rd on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2002 list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions.

<text>Motion Painting No. 1 (1947) is an independent short animated film in which film artist Oskar Fischinger put images in motion to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concerto no. 3, BWV 1048&quot;.

==Production==
The film was created by applying oil paint on Plexiglas. Fischinger filmed each brushstroke over the course of 9 months.

<text>A Movie (styled as A MOVIE) is a 1958 experimental collage film by American artist Bruce Conner. It combines pieces of found footage taken from various sources such as newsreels, soft-core pornography, and B movies, all set to a score featuring Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;.

The film is recognized as a landmark work in American experimental cinema, particularly as an early example of found footage. &quot;A Movie&quot; was inducted into the National Film Registry in 1994.

==Content==

&quot;A Movie&quot; opens with its longest shot, an extended production credit with Bruce Conner&#x27;s name. After the opening credits, the countdown leader is interrupted by a shot of an undressed woman removing her stockings. Once the countdown completes, an intertitle falsely announces &quot;The End&quot; of the film. The film moves into a montage of cavalry, tanks, race cars, and a charging elephant.

Another false ending precedes footage of zeppelins and tightrope walkers. In one well-known sequence, a man in a submarine looks through a periscope to see a woman posing in a bikini, leading to the launch of a torpedo and a mushroom cloud. This leads to water sporting accidents and racing mishaps. As the musical score swells, a succession of violent scenes ensues, including aerial bombings, the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster, and firing squads. The film closes with a scuba diver exploring a shipwreck.

==Background==
Bruce Conner developed the concept for &quot;A Movie&quot; many years before he began working on it. He was inspired early on by a battle scene in the Marx Brothers&#x27; &quot;Duck Soup&quot; that builds a montage from stock footage. He envisioned a film combining images and sounds from many different movies and, when watching movies, often imagined possible sequences that could be created from them.

Conner and Larry Jordan began the Camera Obscura Film Society during the late 1950s. Conner was interested in the film leader used by projectionists that went unseen by the audience. He had a filmstrip given to him by writer Lee Streiff which showed a nude woman, and he thought about inserting the strip in the countdown leader at a Camera Obscura screening of &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. When Jordan found out about the plan, he threatened to quit the society. Conner decided that the only way for him to carry out this vision would be to insert such a sequence in a film of his own.

==Production==
Jordan showed Conner how to edit film and offered him the use of a Griswold film splicer. Describing cinema as &quot;a rich man&#x27;s art form&quot;, Conner looked to store-bought footage as an economical alternative to shooting original material. He purchased a condensed Hopalong Cassidy western, a short novelty film called &quot;Thrills and Spills&quot;, a Castle home movie containing German propaganda, and a newsreel compilation titled &quot;Headlines of 1953&quot;.

Conner primarily worked in assemblage at the time, and he originally planned to use the film as part of an installation piece. The installation would fill a cube into which people could walk. The film would have no soundtrack; instead, the installation would play the film as a loop with sound coming from tape players, radio, and television. However, Conner was not able to fulfill his original vision. The cost of a rear projection machine for the installation was prohibitively expensive.
He decided to make the film a stand-alone work and edited the segments together using a radio to time them. During one editing session, Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; came on the radio and synced well with the ending. &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; had been used ten years earlier by Kenneth Anger for his avant-garde short film &quot;Fireworks&quot;. Conner made a recording from the first, second, and fourth movements and added the music to the completed image track. He was unsure how to clear the rights to the music and used the recording without authorization. He completed the film on a budget of $350 ().

==Release==
&quot;A Movie&quot; premiered June 10, 1958, at the East and West Gallery in San Francisco. It was part of a reception for Conner&#x27;s first solo art show. Shortly after, the film was acquired for distribution by Cinema 16 in New York. When local distributor Canyon Cinema emerged in the early 1960s, &quot;A Movie&quot; was one of its more well-known offerings.

==Legacy==
At its 1960 Creative Film Awards Presentation, the Creative Film Foundation gave &quot;A Movie&quot; an Award of Distinction, with Michael McClure describing its comedy &quot;not [as] a free laugh but the reconstruction of human depth, achievement and emotion&quot;. It has gone on to be recognized as a landmark piece of avant-garde cinema. In 1994, &quot;A Movie&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Filmmaker Peter Hutton has cited &quot;A Movie&quot; as an influence on his work. Artist Christian Marclay first saw the film as a student, and it influenced his own practice of appropriating materials and establishing new connections between them. Alan Berliner&#x27;s 1985 film &quot;Everywhere at Once&quot; uses &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; for its soundtrack in an homage to &quot;A Movie&quot;. Jennifer Proctor remade it in 2010 as &quot;A Movie by Jen Proctor&quot;. Her digital remake follows the original nearly shot for shot, using footage downloaded from YouTube and LiveLeak.

<text>Multiple SIDosis is a 1970 short film in which a single performer creates an entire multi-part performance of the song &quot;Nola&quot;. It is an example of a kind of one-man-band musical performance.

==Summary==
&quot;Multiple SIDosis&quot;, written by, directed by and starred Sid Laverents, features as many as twelve split-screen &quot;copies&quot; of Laverents playing various conventional and improvised instruments simultaneously. The separately-recorded performances of the various parts were overdubbed and visually composited to create the final piece.

==Technique==
The overdubbing technique has been used before and since in professional recording studios, to allow a single performer to create an entire multi-instrument song. Digital technology has made the technique much easier for amateurs to employ today, but no such labour-saving devices were available to Laverents.

==Legacy==
In 2000, &quot;Multiple SIDosis&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>The Music Box is a Laurel and Hardy short film comedy released in 1932. It was directed by James Parrott, produced by Hal Roach and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film, which depicts the pair attempting to move a piano up a long flight of steps, won the first Academy Award for Best Live Action Short (Comedy) in 1932. In 1997, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film is widely seen as the most iconic Laurel and Hardy short, with the featured stairs becoming a popular tourist attraction.

==Plot==
In a music store, a woman arranges for the purchase and delivery of a player piano as a birthday surprise for her husband. Upon disclosing her address at 1127 Walnut Avenue to the store manager, the Laurel and Hardy Transfer Company is enlisted to transport the instrument using their horse-drawn freight wagon.

Encountering a formidable challenge in the form of a lengthy stairway leading to the residence, the duo attempts to navigate the piano up the steps. Amidst their arduous efforts, they inadvertently cause the instrument to descend the stairs multiple times, resulting in a series of mishaps and encounters with various individuals, including a nursemaid, a cop, and the imposing Professor Theodore von Schwartzenhoffen. Remaining persistent, Laurel and Hardy eventually succeed in reaching the top, only to face further misfortune as the piano rolls back down, dragging Ollie along. After realizing a simpler route was available, they use it to deliver the piano to the address. Despite finding no one there, they get the instrument into the house, making a mess of the living room in the process.

Their struggles culminate in a confrontation with the irate Professor, who resides at the address. Infuriated by the mess and the piano, an instrument he detests, he destroys it with an axe just as his wife returns. Upon learning he was the piano&#x27;s intended recipient, the professor regrets his actions and agrees to sign for the delivery. A final mishap involving an ink-spraying pen causes him to lose his temper once more, prompting Laurel and Hardy to hastily depart.

==Location==
The steps, 133 with multiple landings, which are the focal point of &quot;The Music Box,&quot; still exist in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles, near the Laurel and Hardy Park. The steps are a public staircase that connects Vendome Street (at the base of the hill) with Descanso Drive (at the top of the hill), and are located at 923-925 North Vendome Street near the intersection of Del Monte Drive. A plaque commemorating the film was set into one of the lower steps.

The steps can also be seen in the Charley Chase silent comedy &quot;Isn&#x27;t Life Terrible?&quot; (1925), during a scene in which Chase is trying to sell fountain pens to Fay Wray. The steps are also used, for a gag similar to &quot;Hats Off&quot; and &quot;The Music Box&quot;, in &quot;Ice Cold Cocos&quot; (1926), a Billy Bevan comedy short directed by Del Lord. The steps are also referenced in &quot;The Laurel and Hardy Love Affair&quot;, a short story by Ray Bradbury, as the meeting place of the couple in the story, who call each other Ollie and Stan in homage to the comedic duo.

Although similar in appearance, the staircase is not the same one used by The Three Stooges in their 1941 film &quot;An Ache in Every Stake&quot;. Those stairs (147 steps in length) are approximately two miles northeast, located at 2212 Edendale Place in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles.

==Reception== 
The short was popular with audiences in 1932 and generally well received by critics. After previewing &quot;The Music Box&quot; in late February that year, the New York trade paper &quot;The Film Daily&quot; assured theater owners that the comedy &quot;is up to the Laurel-Hardy standard, and should score easily.&quot; &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot;, after previewing the film in March, described it as &quot;great fun&quot; and noted, &quot;Unusually long for a comedy [short], it is well worth the extra length.&quot; The Chicago-based movie magazine &quot;Motion Picture&quot; is even more enthusiastic about the comedy in its June 1932 issue:
Not all contemporary reviews, however, were positive. &quot;Variety&quot;, the entertainment industry&#x27;s leading paper in 1932, did not publish its review of &quot;The Music Box&quot; until November 22, over seven months after MGM officially released the short to theaters.

*The film is a partial remake of their lost silent short &quot;Hats Off!&quot; (1927), directed by Hal Yates, which utilized a washing machine instead of a piano, and was filmed at the same location and is today considered a lost film. &quot;Hats Off&quot; was itself remade by Edgar Kennedy in 1945 as &quot;It&#x27;s Your Move&quot; (again directed by Yates), but utilizing a different staircase although located in the same vicinity where the &quot;Music Box Steps&quot; are in Silver Lake (known as the Descanso Stairs, they are situated at the intersection of Descanso and Larissa drives, specifically between the residences of 3217 Descanso Drive and 3200-3206 Larissa Drive, and one block from Sunset Boulevard, which can be seen in the background in several long shots).
*Hal Roach Studios colorized &quot;The Music Box&quot; in 1986 with a remastered stereo soundtrack featuring the Hal Roach Studios incidental stock music score conducted by Ronnie Hazelhurst. The film was later released on VHS along with a colorized version of &quot;Helpmates&quot;. 
*&quot;The Music Box&quot; was also dubbed in Spanish, with the lengthy title &quot;No cualquiera aguanta un piano, mucho menos una pianola&quot; (the English translation being &quot;Not anyone can load a piano, let alone a pianola&quot;).
*With some aspects of the original script omitted, actor Jorge Arvizu and other actors have produced additional Spanish versions of &quot;The Music Box&quot;, as well as other remakes of Laurel and Hardy shorts and features.
*At least two other short comedy films used the &quot;Music Box Steps&quot; prior to Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s film &quot;Hats Off!&quot;: &quot;Isn&#x27;t Life Terrible?&quot;, made in 1925 by Charley Chase. And &quot;Ice Cold Cocos&quot; starring Billy Bevan and Andy Clyde, made a year later in 1926.
