<text>Eleusinion (), also called the City Eleusinion () was a sanctuary on the lower part of the north slope of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, dedicated to Demeter and Kore (Persephone). It was the central hub of Eleusinian Mysteries within Athens and the starting point for the annual procession to Eleusis, in the northwest of Attica. Religious activity is attested in the area from the 7th century BC and construction took place throughout late Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods. The sanctuary was enclosed within the new city walls built after the Herulian sack of Athens in AD 267 and it remained in use until the late fourth century AD.

Only the western part of the sanctuary has been excavated, which consists of an upper area and three terraces, centring on a small temple for the hero Triptolemus, an outer &quot;propylon&quot; (gateway) and a South Stoa. A circular building in the southernmost part of the sanctuary might be a banqueting hall dedicated to Plouton and a precinct at the northernmost edge of the area might have belonged to Hecate. Sculptural fragments have been discovered from an inner propylon which led to the actual Temple of Demeter and Kore in the unexcavated area to the east and literary sources mention further structures. Many inscriptions, sculptures, pottery vessels, and other offerings from the sanctuary have been recovered.

==Location==

The sanctuary is located on the lower part of the northern slope of the Acropolis, just to the south of the Athenian Agora. The western boundary was the Panathenaic Way, along which the Post-Herulian Wall was built in the late third century AD. The southern limit is the perimeter road running around the upper slopes of the Acropolis. The northern boundary was the northern branch of the Street of the Tripods. The distance from north to south is about 200 metres. The eastern border is unknown, but may have been up to 200 metres from the western edge.

The general location of the sanctuary was known from references in Xenophon, Philostratus, scholia to Aristophanes, and especially Pausanias, who places it above the Enneakrounos (nine jets) fountain, which he locates in the south central Agora. The site was excavated as part of the American excavations of the Athenian Agora, in 1936-1939 and 1959–1960. Only a strip from the western edge of the sanctuary has been excavated, varying in width from 18 to 40 metres. Many structures known from literary sources have not been found and are presumed to be located further east, under modern housing.

Inscriptions, sculpture, and votive vessels relating to the Eleusinian cult are found throughout the Agora, but they cluster mainly in the area of the Eleusinion. Three inscriptions found in the area specifically state that they were to be set up in the Eleusinion. These factors confirm the identification of the site as the Eleusinion.

==Description==
===Literary sources===
Pausanias describes the sanctuary in the 2nd century AD, as containing two temples, one for Demeter and Kore (Persephone) and the other for Triptolemus. There was a bronze statue of a bull in front of the latter. Pausanias says that he was forbidden from discussing the contents of the sanctuary in detail by a dream and says nothing about the temple of Demeter and Kore, but does describe the temple of Triptolemus. This seems to indicate that the sanctuary consisted of an inner, holier section containing the former temple and an outer, less holy section containing Triptolemus&#x27; temple.

Other sources refer to an altar, a source of purifying water, a shrine called the Tomb of Immaradus, and a Ploutonion.

===Overview of archaeological remains===
The sanctuary consists of an upper area and three terraces, descending down the slope from south to north. The original sanctuary consisted of only section II and the upper terrace, but it was later expanded to incorporate the middle terrace. It is unclear whether the lower terrace was actually part of the sanctuary.
;Section II 
The upper (southernmost) area is &quot;Section II&quot;, a steep slope, located outside the peribolos wall, but apparently part of the original sanctuary area, since archaeological evidence reveals votive deposits. There is also a circular building of Hellenistic date. A vaulted branch of the aqueduct of Hadrian, built in the mid-2nd century AD, runs along the north side of the section, ultimately feeding into the nymphaeum in the southeast of the Agora. To the south of that was a narrow Roman road, which led to a gate in the Post-Herulian wall. 
;Upper terrace
The upper terrace, formed by a flat section of bedrock was the original core of the sanctuary. It contains a &quot;rocky outcrop&quot; at the western edge, which is 2 metres wide, 3 metres long and rises above the surrounding area. Such outcrops were often important in cults of Demeter throughout the Greek world. The area is enclosed by a polygonal limestone wall (&quot;the Archaic peribolos&quot;), built around 575-550 BC. It varied between 0.9 and 1.15 metres in thickness at the base; the whole 22 metre-long stretch is preserved on the western side; the foundation trench and shorter stretches are preserved on the northern and southern sides for 26 and 28 metres respectively. The eastern wall has not been uncovered. The original entrance to the precinct was on the south side, 3 metres from the western end, opening onto &quot;Section II&quot;. A second entrance was built on the same wall, 20 metres to the east, in the period 350-325 BC, possibly part of the construction work of 329/8 BC. In the Hellenistic period, the south peribolos wall was demolished and the South Stoa was built over the top of it, separating the upper terrace from &quot;Section II&quot; and sealing both entrances.A propylon (gateway) was built into the peribolos wall on the west side, near the southern end, at the same time as the South Stoa was built, and served as the main entrance to the Eleusinion thereafter. The north edge was of the upper terrace was formed by a retaining wall 6.8 metres north of the Stoa, which was demolished in the 4th century AD. 
;Middle terrace
The middle terrace was added to the sanctuary at the end of the 6th century, doubling the size of the sanctuary. The temple of Triptolemus stood here, with its entrance facing onto the edge of the upper stoa. The area was surrounded by the &quot;early 5th-century peribolos wall,&quot; which is preserved in small stretches on the west and north. It is made of limestone and was 1.10 metres wide. The northern wall has been revealed for a length of 28 metres. The western wall was 21 metres long and continues the archaic peribolos. The northern and western parts of the peribolos were covered over by a massive retaining wall in the 4th century BC. It may have supported a platform for viewing the Panathenaic procession. There were steps on the outer west face of this retaining wall for inscribed stelae. A 0.8 metre-wide dividing wall runs north–south to the east of the temple, diving the it off from the inner sanctuary. 
;Lower terrace
The lower terrace, originally a marsh, was created at the end of the 6th century BC with the rubble from clearing the middle terrace of houses. It was outside the peribolos wall of the Eleusinion and it is unclear whether it was part of the sanctuary. A 6-meter-long east–west wall at the western end of this terrace, just north of the retaining wall, was built in the fourth century BC, it may have been the peribolos for a small adjunct shrine, of which no trace now remains. In the 1st century AD, the area was flattened and a complex was built on the western edge of the terrace, consisting of four rooms, three bases for monuments or altars, and an offering table. This complex may have been a workshop, a separate sanctuary, or - most likely - a set of storerooms for the Eleusinion&#x27;s grain supply. The northern edge of the lower terrace was bound by an east–west street from the 6th century BC until the Ottoman period. Abutting this street and the Panathenaic Way, in the northwest corner of the sanctuary, was a small precinct, probably for Hecate.

===Temple of Triptolemus===

The temple faces north–south and is 17.813 m long and 11.065 metres wide. The entrance was at the south end (i.e. opening onto the upper terrace). Traces of the foundation and roof have been found; nothing from the superstructure survives, but it was probably made of marble, like the roof. Margaret Miles proposes that the dimensions and materials indicate that it was an Ionic tetrastyle amphiprostyle temple, i.e. with four Ionic columns at the north and south ends. This is the same design used for the later Temple of Athena Nike on the Acropolis. The columns would have been about 1.10 m in diameter at the base. Construction began on the temple between 500 and 490 BC, as shown by pottery evidence from the foundations. The remnants of the roof seem to date to 475-450 BC. This date coincides with the proliferation of images of Triptolemus in Athenian art. The chief of works may have been Coroebus, who also oversaw the construction of the 5th century Telesterion at Eleusis.

The foundations are made of gray kara limestone, but yellow poros and limestone from the Acropolis were also used in the walls. Because of the steepness of the slope, the south end of the temple sits directly on the bedrock, while the north end required ten courses of masonry. The cuttings in the bedrock for the temple&#x27;s foundations are still visible on the western side. The foundations were built of high-quality polygonal masonry, without clamps or dowels. The foundation blocks survive for the whole north side and parts of the western and eastern sides. The foundations of the cross-wall that separated the pronaos from the cella are partially preserved. An extension was added to the east side of the temple during construction, which measures 2.20-2.355 m wide and is composed of red crystalline blocks originally cut for use in some other context. The addition may have been made so that the width:length ratio of the temple would be closer to the golden ratio, which became popular in temple construction at this time.

The remains of the roof consist of 88 fragments from marble tiles (30 cover tiles, 58 pan tiles, 1 end ridge tile) and 4 marble antefixes. The workmanship is of a very high standard. The palmettes of the antefixes resemble the archaic Telesterion at Eleusis (510-500 BC), and especially those from the roofs of the treasuries in the sanctuary of Apollo at Delos (478-450 BC). 

The archaeological remains are identified as the temple of Triptolemus mentioned by Pausanias because his account indicates that it was in the outer part of the sanctuary and archaeology shows that the entrance to the Eleusinion in his time was through the propylon next to this temple. In mythology, Triptolemus was the first human to receive the gifts of farming and initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries from Demeter. He then rode around the world in a winged chariot, informing all people of these gifts.

Pausanias states that there was a statue of Triptolemus inside the temple. This has not been discovered archaeologically, but is probably one of the symbols depicted on fourth-century BC Panathenaic amphorae. There are examples from 364/3 onwards showing the statue standing in a winged chariot holding a branch, with a snake next to the chariots wheels. Pausanias also mentions statues of the semi-legendary seer Epimenides and of a bull in front of this temple. The latter probably depicted the bull with gilded horns which was the standard sacrificial offering for Triptolemus according to the late fifth-century First-Fruits decree. To the east of the temple, there are the limestone foundations of altar (1.10 x 2.70 metres), probably built in ca. 500 BC. East of this is a 2.20 metre long monument base of yellow poros, running east–west, which was built in the period 450-425 BC; it seems to have been intended to support a set of inscribed stelae (no longer present).

===Outer propylon===
A propylon (gateway) was built into the peribolos wall on the west side, near the southern end, in the 2nd century BC, opening onto the Panathenaic Way. It served as the main entrance to the Eleusinion thereafter. It was a porch, with an H-shaped ground plan, i.e. two walls perpendicular to the peribolos wall which supported a roof, and a cross-wall between them, containing the actual doors.

The foundations are consist of poros, conglomerate, and marble blocks - many of them reused - set directly into the bedrock. In the centre, the foundations were covered over by Hymettan marble pavers, some of which survive. The date of construction is indicated by pottery sherds found in the packing of the foundations and by parallels with other Athenian structures of similar date. It precedes cuttings made into the bedrock to the west in order to lower and pave the Panathenaic Way in the first and second centuries AD.

The propylon was incorporated into the Post-Herulian Wall in the late third century AD.

===South Stoa===
The South Stoa was added on the south side of the upper terrace in the second century BC, replacing the archaic peribolos. This stoa provided a sheltered area facing the temple of Triptolemus, which was used for dedications and for visitors to the sanctuary. It measures 8.90 metres from north–south. The excavated portion is 25.40 metres long, but the stoa continued further east into the unexcavated area. Fragments from the superstructure indicate that the steps were made of Hymettan marble, while the columns and entablature were Pentelic marble. The columns were roughly three metres apart and were probably Doric. It was probably only one story high, but this is not certain. A set of diamond and oval lattice window frames might come from a second-story balustrade or from the western and eastern walls. At the east end, the back wall is preserved to a height of 2.75 metres. The interior floor was a layer of beaten earth, which slowly wore away until visitors were walking directly on the bedrock.

Three phases of construction are attested in the back (south) wall. In the first, preserved for the western 18.5 metres, the foundation was built from regular yellow poros orthostates (0.65 metres high, 1.15 metres long, 0.42 metres thick), connected together with wooden clamps, and topped by dressed masonry. A second-century BC date for this initial phase is indicated by pottery in the fill of the foundations and by the absence of mortar. In the second stage, in the late Roman period, the orthostates were patched using irregular limestone blocks topped brick and mortar (preserved in the eastern portion). Finally, in Byzantine times, the wall was patched again with brick and stone, serving as a wall for later structures. At the north side of the stoa, a 1.5 metre wide cutting runs the whole length of the stoa. Conglomerate blocks sat in this cutting supported the front steps and columns. The short western exterior wall had bases for mounting inscriptions, which could be read by passers-by on the Panathenaic Way.

Destruct debris shows that the stoa went out of use in the late fourth century. By the 6th century, parts of its structure had been incorporated into new buildings and a ramp had been built through the back wall to allow access to the east–west road behind it.

===Circular building===
A circular building was constructed 17.2 metres south of the South Stoa in Section II. It is known from a circular cutting in the bedrock and part of a poros wall, preserved to a height of 0.52 metres. The bedrock around the structure was smoothed down to create a flat area. The cutting indicates that it had a diameter of 7.75-8.00 metres, but the blocks of the wall come from an Archaic or Classical structure which was also circular, but larger, with a diameter of about 19 metres. This earlier structure must have been located somewhere else.

The floor was packed clay and at the exact centre of the room, a 1.35 metre wide millstone was set in the floor. There are no internal supports for a roof, so it may have been a simple flat structure of timber.

Remains of at least five altars were found nearby, confirming that the building served a religious function. Margaret Miles suggests that it was used for ritual dining. This is supported by the discovery of large amounts of cooking ware in the area. A well on the east side of the building may have been connected with this function. In particular, the circular building may have been linked with meals held in honour of Plouton, who is known to have had a shrine in the City Eleusinion. It may also have been connected with the Thesmophoria.

The structure was built in the 2nd century BC, as shown by pottery from the fill of the foundations. Fills from the northwestern and eastern sections show it was dismantled and rebuilt with the same plan but a new floor around AD 100, probably in connection with a new drainage system, which closed the eastern well. A final set of fills show that it was partially dismantled in the late 2nd or 3rd centuries AD.

===Inner propylon===

The inner propylon, built in the mid-second century AD, was a monumental gateway leading from the outer sanctuary (the excavated area, centring on the Temple of Triptolemus) to the inner sanctuary centring on the Temple of Demeter and Kore, which was closed to non-initiates. The foundations of this structure have not been excavated, but fragments of the masonry and sculpture have been found in the excavations and reused in the Little Metropolis.

The fragments closely parallel those from the inner propylon of the sanctuary at Eleusis, which provides the basis for a reconstruction. The main sculptural fragments are two caryatids, which would have stood on the inner side of the gate, supporting a porch. A Doric frieze on the outside of the gate consisted of metopes and triglyphs with Eleusinian symbols (poppies, myrtle, plemochoae, phialae, bucrania). Parallels between structures at Eleusis and in the city of Athens are typical of those constructed under Hadrian, part of &quot;an imperial Athenianisation of Eleusis.&quot;

==History==
The site was occupied in the Neolithic period and in the Middle Bronze Age, because of the nearby Klepsydra spring. The middle terrace contained housing from ca. 850 BC, while the terracotta figurines found in the upper terrace indicate that it was a religious sanctuary for a female deity at this time. The absence of signs of habitation in the area may indicate that it was already a sacred site before this. The upper terrace was enclosed by the Archaic peribolos wall ca. 575-550 BC. This may have been the work of the tyrant Peisistratus, but this is not certain; it may pre-date him. No literary sources refer to a connection between him and the Eleusinian cult.

At the end of the sixth century or the beginning of the fifth century, the middle terrace was cleared of housing and added to the sanctuary, more than doubling its size. The first evidence specifically identifying the site as the Eleusinion are a pair of altars associated with the new temple, which are inscribed with the regulations of the Eleusinian Mysteries and date to ca. 510-500 BC. Construction of the temple of Triptolemus began around 500, was interrupted by the Persian Wars, and was completed between 475 and 450 BC. Three deposits indicate that the sanctuary was damaged during the Persian sack of Athens in 479 BC. It is likely that a new temple of Demeter and Kore was built at this time as well, although there is no archaeological evidence for this, since it has not been excavated.

The sanctuary was one of the few sites in Athens not to be occupied by refugees from the countryside at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, according to Thucydides, because its walls and gates allowed it to be locked. In 414 BC, following the conviction of Alcibiades and others for the profanation of the mysteries and mutilation of the Herms, their property was seized and auctioned off. A set of ten inscriptions known as the &quot;Attic Stelae&quot;, which listed all the property, sales prices, and purchasers, were erected in the Eleusinion, where most of the 77 known fragments have been found. All the Eleusinian officials uttered curses against the convicts, except for the priestess of Demeter and Kore, Theano, who declared that she was &quot;a praying priestess not a cursing priestess.&quot; A series of inscribed accounts describe the contents of the sanctuary in 408/7 BC, including many gold votives, as well as construction materials.

A financial account from 329/8 BC describes extensive repairs to the Eleusinion in that year, as part of the wider revitalisation of Athens and its cults spearheaded by Lycurgus. This was also the period when most votive relief plaques were dedicated.

In the second century BC, a major renovation to the sanctuary took place, involving the construction of the South Stoa, the Hellenistic Propylon, and the circular building. Two inscriptions honour individuals for undertaking construction in the sanctuary at this time. One is fragmentary; the other honours Satyra priestess of the Thesmophori for repairing all the temples, the sanctuary of Plouton, and paying for annual sacrifices. The period from the 3rd century to the early 1st century BC is also the time when most of the honorific decrees were erected in the sanctuary - seventeen are known, mostly honouring &quot;epimeletai&quot; (organisers) of the Eleusinian Mysteries.

The Panhellenion, established by Emperor Hadrian in 131/2 AD, seems to have had a role in the administration of the Eleusinion and the Eleusinian cult. They had a letter from an Imperial official inscribed on a stele on the outer west side of the sanctuary.
The section of the Panatheniac Way running along the west side of the sanctuary was lowered and paved in two stages in the first and second centuries AD. A branch from the aqueduct of Hadrian was built behind the sanctuary in the mid-second century AD. In the same period, the inner propylon seems to have been built and the circular building was renovated.

=== Late Antiquity and after ===

The sanctuary&#x27;s continued importance is shown by the fact that, after the Herulian Sack in 267 AD, it was placed inside the Post-Herulian wall (much of the city, including most of the Agora was left outside this new circuit wall). That the sanctuary continued in use is shown by the fact that, unlike many other structures, it was not spoliated to provide building material for the wall. The Eleusinian cult remained active until at least 375 AD, but is unlikely to have survived the Anti-pagan legislation of Theodosius I. The South Stoa and perhaps the Temple of Triptolemus were demolished at the end of the fourth century, probably as a result of Alaric the Goth&#x27;s sack of Athens in AD 396.

The area was then covered over with houses and a laundry complex was built on the western end of the south stoa in the 7th century AD, taking advantage of the water supply still provided by the aqueduct of Hadrian. There was a large fire in the area in the reign of Constans II (641-668), which destroyed the laundry and would have seriously damaged any Classical structures that were still standing. Spoliation of masonry and sculpture from the area took place throughout the Byzantine and Ottoman periods, but especially in the 9th-10th centuries, when there was a quarry on the lower terrace. The churches of Hypapanti and of Christ were built at the south and north ends of the area respectively, in the 17th century, incorporating the gates of the Post-Herulian wall and parts of the sanctuary into their foundations. The Church of Christ had fallen into ruin by the 1850s, but its northern wall is still in situ and its wall paintings are faintly visible. The Church of Hypapanti was deconsecrated and demolished in 1936 to allow the excavations to take place. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the area had a reputation as a good source of marble for use as building material. Marbles from the Eleusinion have been found in old buildings throughout the old centre of Athens, notably in the Little Metropolis. It remained a residential area until excavated in the twentieth century.

==Function and activities==

The Eleusinion was the Athenian base of the cult of Demeter and Kore at Eleusis in western Attica. It was one of several sanctuaries in the city of Athens that linked the city to a cult in an outlying area of Attica, alongside the sanctuary of Artemis of Brauron atop the Acropolis and that of Dionysius of Eleutherae on the south slopes of the Acropolis.

At the start of the Eleusinian Mysteries, sacred objects were brought from Eleusis to the Eleusinion by the ephebes. They were stored there for the first five days of the festival. During this time people who wished to be initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries gathered in the Eluesinion to undergo the &quot;pre-initiation&quot; (&quot;myesis&quot;) under the guidance of members of the two Eleusinian clans, the Eumolpidae and the Kerykes. Aside from this, non-initiates were not allowed to enter the inner part of the sanctuary, which was demarcated by the inner propylon. On the sixth day of the festival, a great procession took them back to Eleusis, where they were revealed to the initiates at the culmination of the mysteries. After the mysteries, the Council of Five Hundred met in the Eleusinion in order to review the conduct of the festival.

The Eleusinion was probably also one of the sites where women celebrated the Thesmophoria festival.

Two inscriptions from the late fourth century BC and one from the first century BC honour wealthy Athenian men for preparing ritual meals in honour of Plouton. From the late Hellenistic period, these meals may have been held in the circular building in section II.

During the games at the Great Panathenaea festival, several cavalry races were held on the Panathenaic Way, with their end point at the Eleusinion. In the second century BC, these included a chariot race and the apobates.

===Votive deposits===
Seventh century BC votive deposits consist of terracotta figurines, miniature vessels, pottery, spindles, loomweights, and disks. The figurines are called &quot;columnar females&quot; because the body is formed from a long column that flares out at the bottom to represent a skirt. There are two outstretched arms and a ball for the head that was pinched to make the nose. Sometimes breasts were added. They differ from the figurines found in contemporary deposits elesewhere in the Agora, which are mostly horses and shields. 
A pottery vessel called a &quot;plemochoe&quot; () is a common votive find in the sanctuary from the beginning of the 4th century BC until the end of the 2nd century BC. They consist of a high foot supporting a wide bowl, ranging in diameter from 0,024 metres to 0.26 metres, with a handle on either side. Originally they had peaked lids with holes in them. They are rarely decorated and are made of soft or coarse clay, suggesting that they were only intended to be used once. They are depicted on the relief from the inner propylon and a similar relief from Eleusis. A large marble plemochoe (0.62 metres high) was found in Section II of the Eleusinion, suggesting an association specifically with the shrine of Plouton. In processions, women carried them on top of their heads. According to Athenaeus, on the last day of the Eleusinian Mysteries two plemochoae were filled with liquid and then tipped over, one to the west and one to the east, while a magic formula was recited. Their close connection with the Eleusinian cult is shown by the fact that they are rarely found in any context aside from the Eleusinion and the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Eleusis. In many cases they were buried in holes specifically cut for them in the bedrock, a chthonian setting, which corroborates the association with Plouton.

From the fifth century BC through the 4th century AD, various individuals dedicated monuments in the sanctuary, mostly statues. Twenty-six inscribed bases from these statues are known, of which the earliest is a dedication of two crowns by the priestess Lysistrate around 450 BC. Of the rest, eleven were dedicated in the 4th century BC, one in the 3rd century BC, five in the 2nd century BC, four in the 1st century BC (including a herm of Phaedrus the Epicurean), and one each in the first four centuries AD. Nineteen pieces of sculpture have been recovered, including thirteen votive reliefs. Most of these depict Demeter and Kore and belong to the 4th century BC. Three depict Triptolemus; others show the Eleusinian heroes Iacchus, Eubouleus, and Ploutus; and two show Hecate. There are also fragments from two marble torches. By the second century BC, the priestesses of Demeter and Kore had the right to erect a painted portrait of themselves in the temple of Demeter and Kore.

===Administration===
The administration of the Eleusinion was regulated by the Athenian state and the clans of the Eumolpidae and Kerykes. The highest-ranking officials were the priestess of Demeter and Kore and the hierophant, both of whom came from the Eumolpid clan and held office for life.

Andocides says that regulations for the Eleusinion were included in the mid-sixth century BC laws of Solon. Literary sources and inscriptions make regular references to regulations and ritual norms. These regulations tend to treat the City Eleusinion, a smaller Eleusinion at Phalerum, and the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Eleusis as a single unit. The surviving inscribed regulations from the City Eleusinion are:
* &quot;IG&quot; I3 231–232, ca. 510-500 BC, apparently consolidating earlier regulations;
* &quot;IG&quot; I3 6, ca. 475-450 BC, regulating many aspects of the cult;
* &quot;I Eleusis&quot; 30 (&quot;the Koroibos decree&quot;), ca. 450 BC, on cult finances;
* &quot;Agora&quot; XVI 56, ca. 350 BC, detailed regulations of all aspects of the cult;
* &quot;I Eleusis&quot; 250, ca. 100 BC, regulating the Eleusinian procession;
* &quot;IG&quot; II2 1078, ca. AD 220, regulating the ephebes&#x27; participation in the Eleusinian procession

Numerous decrees whose topics touched in Eleusinian matters were also erected in the sanctuary. Thirty such decrees have been found, of which between 17 and 21 are honorific. Most of these belong to the Hellenistic period and honour the organisers of the Eleusinian Mysteries.

In the late fifth and fourth centuries BC, inscribed inventories listing all the cult&#x27;s assets were erected annually by a board of &quot;epistatai&quot;, who were responsible for the finances of the Eleusinian cult.

==Excavation history==

Following the chance discovery of some masonry blocks on 22 June 1848, Kyriakos Pittakis pushed for excavations, eventually undertaking exploratory excavations from 11 to 15 April 1851, which led to larger-scale excavations from 1851 to 1852. Houses were removed and part of the Post-Herulian wall was uncovered (which was largely constructed of classical sculpture, masonry, and inscriptions), as well as the retaining wall above the temple of Triptolemus. Pittakis believed the site was part of the grounds of the Bouleuterion (town council). A minor excavation was undertaken by in 1910.

The Eleusinion fell within the area purchased by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens for their Agora excavations in the 1930s. Excavations of the area were begun in 1936 and continued until 1939, when they were brought to a close due to the Outbreak of World War II. The leaders of the excavation were Arthur W. Parsons, Margaret Crosby, and Rodney Young. The excavations uncovered the archaic temple, the western propylon, the south stoa in the area of the 19th century excavations and extended further south up the slope and further west across the Panathenaic Way. Discoveries of votive figurines, coins associated with the Eleusinian cult, inscriptions connected with the Eleusinian cult, and especially votive pits full of &quot;kernoi&quot; led to the identification of the site with the Eleusinion in 1938. The excavations of Section II were particularly disrupted by the war; most of the finds were left unlabelled and unsorted. Near three-quarters of pottery finds proved unsalvagable.

A final set of excavations were undertaken in 1959-1960 by Eugene Vanderpool. Four houses were demolished to extend the excavated area to the east. William Bell Dinsmoor and Margaret Miles carried out surveys in 1980-1981 and Miles restudied the pottery finds, which enable the dating of the site&#x27;s phases, between 1988 and 1992.

<text>Iambe (Ancient Greek: Ἰάμβη means &#x27;banter&#x27;), in Greek mythology, was a Thracian woman, daughter of Pan and Echo, granddaughter of Hermes, and a servant of Metaneira, the wife of Hippothoon. Others call her a slave of Celeus, king of Eleusis.

== Mythology ==
The extravagant hilarity displayed at the festivals of Demeter in Attica was traced to her, for it is said that when Demeter, in her wanderings in search of her daughter, arrived in Attica, Iambe cheered the mournful goddess with her jokes.Till Iambe, who was knowing and careful, placed for her&lt;br&gt;A fixed seat, and draped a bright-shining fleece over it.&lt;br&gt;There she sat down, and held a veil in front of her.&lt;br&gt;For a long time she sat on the couch without speaking, sorrowing,&lt;br&gt;Nor did she embrace anyone in word or deed,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But without laughing and not tasting food or drink&lt;br&gt;She sat wasting away in longing for her deep-girdled daughter,&lt;br&gt;Till Iambe, who was knowing and careful, with jests&lt;br&gt;Made many jokes and turned the mood of the divine lady,&lt;br&gt;By smiling and laughing, and keeping her heart gracious:&lt;br&gt;So she pleased the goddess afterwards with her kindly temperament.Iambe was believed to have given the name to iambic poetry, for some said that she hanged herself in consequence of the cutting speeches in which she had indulged, and others that she had cheered Demeter by a dance in the Iambic metre.

<doc id="80618" wikidata="Q690603" url="?curid=80618" title="Iacchus">
<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Iacchus (also Iacchos, Iakchos) () was a minor deity, of some cultic importance, particularly at Athens and Eleusis in connection with the Eleusinian mysteries, but without any significant mythology. He perhaps originated as the personification of the ritual exclamation &quot;Iacche!&quot; cried out during the Eleusinian procession from Athens to Eleusis. He was often identified with Dionysus, perhaps because of the resemblance of the names &quot;Iacchus&quot; and &quot;Bacchus&quot;, another name for Dionysus. By various accounts he was a son of Demeter (or apparently her husband), or a son of Persephone, identical with Dionysus Zagreus, or a son of Dionysus.

During the Greco-Persian Wars, when the Attic countryside, deserted by the Greeks, was being laid waste by the Persians, a ghostly procession was supposed to have been seen advancing from Eleusis, crying out “Iacchus”. This miraculous event was interpreted as a sign of the eventual Greek victory at the Battle of Salamis (480 BC). Iacchus was also possibly involved in an Eleusinian myth in which the old woman Baubo, by exposing her genitals, cheered up the mourning Demeter.

==Cult==
Iacchus was one of the deities, along with Demeter and Kore (Persephone), worshipped as part of the Eleusinian Mysteries. The late 1st-century BC geographer Strabo called him the &quot;ἀρχηγέτην&quot; (&quot;leader-in-chief&quot; or &quot;founder&quot;) &quot;of the mysteries&quot;.

===Statue, temple, and feast day===

There was a statue of Iacchus kept in a temple at Athens. According to the 2nd-century AD geographer Pausanias, the statue held a torch and was by the Athenian sculptor Praxiteles. A passage from Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;The Frogs&quot; (405 BC) suggests it wore a crown of myrtle. According to Pausanias, the statue was kept in a temple of Demeter located near the Dipylon gate, the main entrance to ancient Athens. The temple was perhaps the one that Plutarch referred to as the &quot;so called Iaccheion&quot;. Nearby was the Pompeion, the building which was the assembly point for the procession celebrating the Eleusinian Mysteries. According to the 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia the &quot;Suda&quot;, Iacchus was also the name of his &quot;feast&quot; day, presumably the day that Iacchus was carried to Eleusis as part of the Eleusinian procession.

===Eleusinian procession===
Iacchus and his statue played an important part in the Eleusinian procession. Plutarch referred to the procession as &quot;ἐξαγόντων Ἴακχον&quot; (“leading out Iacchus”). On 19 Boedromion (probably), the statue of Iacchus was taken from its temple and carried as part of the procession of the participants in the Mysteries who walked from Athens to Eleusis, arriving on 20 Boedromion (corresponding to the 28th or 29 September). Along the way, the participants in the procession would cry out the cultic exclamation, &quot;Iacche!&quot;

There was a special official associated with Iacchus and his statue called the &quot;Ἰακχαγωγός&quot; (&#x27;leader/bearer of Iacchus&#x27;), whose function presumably was to carry or accompany the statue of Iacchus during the procession. The &quot;Ἰακχαγωγός&quot; is listed as one of the Eleusinian officials receiving an endowment (c. 160–170 AD), appears in a list of Eleusinian priests given by the 2nd-century AD Julius Pollux, and had a reserved seat in the &quot;prohedria&quot; (&quot;seats in front&quot;) of the Theater of Dionysus at Athens. An incumbent of the office (126/7 AD) is mentioned on four dedications.

A parody of the Eleusinian procession appears in Aristophanes&#x27; comedy &quot;The Frogs&quot;, set in Hades (the underworld). There a chorus of dead mystics, singing and dancing in procession, chant their &quot;hymn to Iacchus&quot;: &quot;O Iacchus, Iacchus O!&quot;, and sing,
:Iacchus, here abiding in temples most reverend,
:Iacchus, O Iacchus,
:come to dance in this meadow;
:to your holy mystic bands
:Shake the leafy crown
:around your head, brimming
:with myrtle,
:Boldly stomp your feet in time
:to the wild fun-loving rite,
:with full share of the Graces, the holy dance, sacred
:to your mystics.

and,

:Awake, for it has come tossing torches in hand,
:Iacchos, Oh Iacchos,
:the light-bringing star of our nocturnal rite.
:Now the meadow brightly burns
:Old men&#x27;s knees start to sway.
:They shake away their pains
:and the long cycles of ancient years
:Through your holy rite.
:Beaming with your torch,
:lead forth to the flowering stretch of marsh
:the youth that makes your choruses, o blessed one!

and,

:Now then
:Summon the god of the hour with your songs
:the partner of this dance of ours.
:Iacchus, honored by all, deviser of our festal song
:most sweet, follow us here
:to the goddess and show us how
:you travel a long road with ease.
:Iacchus, lover of the dance, lead me onward,

===The Lenaea===
Iacchus also played a role in the Lenaia, the winter Athenian festival of Dionysus. According to the scholiast on the &quot;Frogs&quot; of Aristophanes, participants at the Lenaia responded to the command to &quot;Invoke the god&quot; with the invocation, &quot;Hail, Iacchos, son of Semele, thou giver of wealth.&quot; According to the scholiast, the command to call on the god was proclaimed by the Daduchos, a high Eleusinian official 

===At Delphi?===
The name Iacchus—identified with Dionysus—was also possibly associated with cultic ritual at Delphi. Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot;, referring to nocturnal rites occurring on Mount Parnassus above Delphi, contains the invocation: O Leader of the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire, overseer of the chants in the night, son begotten of Zeus, appear, my king, with your attendant Thyiads, who in night-long frenzy dance and sing you as Iacchus the Giver!

==Name and origin==
Iacchus seems to have originated as the personification of the cultic exclamation, &quot;Iacche&quot;, cried out by participants during the Eleusinian procession, with the exclamation itself, having apparently derived from &quot;ιαχή&quot; (&quot;cry&quot;), &quot;ιάχω&quot; (&quot;to cry&quot;). It has been suggested that the cry &quot;iacche’’ over time came to be interpreted as the vocative form of a name &quot;Iacchus&quot;. 
In addition to being the cultic cry, &quot;iacchus&quot; was also a term for a kind of song or hymn of worship, possibly unassociated with the god.

==Identification with Dionysus==
Iacchus is associated with Dionysus at least as early as the 5th century BC. The association may have arisen because of the homophony of the names Iacchus and Bacchus, one of the names of Dionysus. Two black-figure lekythoi (c. 500 BC) may represent the earliest evidence for such an association. The nearly-identical vases, one in Berlin and the other in Rome, depict Dionysus along with the inscription &quot;IAKXNE&quot;, a possible miswriting of &quot;IAKXE&quot;.

More certain early evidence can be found in the works of the 5th-century BC Athenian tragedians Sophocles and Euripides. In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot; (c. 441 BC), an ode to Dionysus begins by addressing Dionysus as the &quot;God of many names&quot; (&quot;πολυώνυμε&quot;), who rules over the glens of Demeter&#x27;s Eleusis, and ends by identifying him with &quot;Iacchus the Giver&quot;, who leads &quot;the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire&quot; and whose &quot;attendant Thyiads&quot; dance in &quot;night-long frenzy&quot;. And in a fragment from a lost play, Sophocles describes Nysa, Dionysus&#x27; traditional place of nurture: &quot;From here I caught sight of Nysa, haunt of Bacchus, famed among mortals, which Iacchus of the bull&#x27;s horns counts as his beloved nurse&quot;. In Euripides&#x27; &quot;Bacchae&quot; (c. 405 BC), a messenger, describing the Bacchic revelries on mount Cithaeron, associates Iacchus with Bromius, another of the names of Dionysus, saying, they &quot;began to wave the thyrsos ... calling on Iacchus, the son of Zeus, Bromius, with united voice.&quot;

An inscription found on a stone stele (c. 340 BC), found at Delphi, contains a paean to Dionysus, which describes the travels of Dionysus to various locations in Greece where he was honored. From Thebes, where he was born, he first went to Delphi where he displayed his &quot;starry body&quot;, and with &quot;Delphian girls&quot; took his &quot;place on the folds of Parnassus&quot;, then next to Eleusis, where he is called &quot;Iacchus&quot;:

:And in your hand brandishing your night-
:lighting flame, with god-possessed frenzy
:you went to the vales of Eleusis
:where the whole people of Hellas&#x27;
:land, alongside your own native witnesses
:of the holy mysteries, calls upon you
:as Iacchus: for mortals from their pains
:you have opened a haven without toils.

Strabo says that Greeks &quot;give the name &#x27;Iacchus&#x27; not only to Dionysus but also to the leader-in-chief of the mysteries&quot;. For the identification of Iacchus with Dionysus in an Orphic context see &quot;Orphic Hymn&quot; 42.4, 49.3.

===Dionysus Zagreus===
In particular Iacchus was identified with Dionysus Zagreus, who was a son of Zeus and Persephone. This Orphic Dionysus was, as an infant, attacked and dismembered by the Titans, but later reborn as Dionysus, the wine-god son of Zeus and Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, the first king of Thebes. As noted above, Sophocles mentions &quot;Iacchus of the bull&#x27;s horns&quot;, and according to the 1st-century BC historian Diodorus Siculus, it was this older Dionysus who was represented in painting and sculpture with horns, because he “excelled in sagacity and was the first to attempt the yoking of oxen and by their aid to effect the sowing of the seed”. Arrian, the 2nd-century Greek historian, wrote that it was to this Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone, &quot;not the Theban Dionysus, that the mystic chant ‘Iacchus’ is sung&quot;. And the 2nd-century poet Lucian refers to the &quot;dismemberment of Iacchus&quot;.

===Nonnus===
The 4th- or 5th-century poet Nonnus, associates the name Iacchus with a &quot;third&quot; Dionysus. He describes the Athenian celebrations given to the first Dionysus Zagreus son of Persephone, the second Dionysus Bromios son of Semele, and the third Dionysus Iacchus:
:They [the Athenians] honoured him as a god next after the son of Persephoneia, and after Semele&#x27;s son; they established sacrifices for Dionysos late born and Dionysos first born, and third they chanted a new hymn for Iacchos. In these three celebrations Athens held high revel; in the dance lately made, the Athenians beat the step in honour of Zagreus and Bromios and Iacchos all together.

==Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Iacchus&quot;==
Possibly the oldest testimony related to Iacchus, is given by the 5th-century Greek historian Herodotus. According to Herodotus, Dicaeus an Athenian exile told the story that, he and the former Spartan king Demaratus, who had become an advisor to the Persian king Xerxes I, witnessed a miraculous event which Dicaeus interpreted as predicting the defeat of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis (480 BC), during the Greco-Persian Wars:

:Dicaeus son of Theocydes, an Athenian exile who had become important among the Medes, said that at the time when the land of Attica was being laid waste by Xerxes&#x27; army and there were no Athenians in the country, he was with Demaratus the Lacedaemonian on the Thriasian plain and saw advancing from Eleusis a cloud of dust as if raised by the feet of about thirty thousand men. They marvelled at what men might be raising such a cloud of dust and immediately heard a cry. The cry seemed to be the “Iacchus” of the mysteries, and when Demaratus, ignorant of the rites of Eleusis, asked him what was making this sound, Dicaeus said, “Demaratus, there is no way that some great disaster will not befall the king&#x27;s army. Since Attica is deserted, it is obvious that this voice is divine and comes from Eleusis to help the Athenians and their allies. If it descends upon the Peloponnese, the king himself and his army on the mainland will be endangered. If, however, it turns towards the ships at Salamis, the king will be in danger of losing his fleet. Every year the Athenians observe this festival for the Mother and the Maiden, and any Athenian or other Hellene who wishes is initiated. The voice which you hear is the ‘Iacchus’ they cry at this festival.” To this Demaratus replied, “Keep silent and tell this to no one else. If these words of yours are reported to the king, you will lose your head, and neither I nor any other man will be able to save you, so be silent. The gods will see to the army.” Thus he advised, and after the dust and the cry came a cloud, which rose aloft and floated away towards Salamis to the camp of the Hellenes. In this way they understood that Xerxes&#x27; fleet was going to be destroyed. Dicaeus son of Theocydes used to say this, appealing to Demaratus and others as witnesses.

However, while the &quot;cloud of dust&quot; and the ritual cry &quot;Iacchus&quot; are apparent references to the Eleusinian procession, no explicit reference is made by Herodotus to Iacchus&#x27; statue, nor in fact to the god himself— either here or elsewhere. Some scholars have taken this passage as evidence that, for Herodotus, Iacchus was not yet a god. This story, associating Iacchus with such an important Greek victory, presumably led to an increase in his fame, popularity and importance throughout Greece, and so conceivably, helped to establish Iacchus as a god.

==Genealogy==
Iacchus, when identified with Dionysus, as he was at the Lenaia in Athens (see above), was considered to be the son of Zeus and Semele, and when identified with Dionysus Zagreus, was considered to be the son Zeus and Persephone. However, several sources associate Iacchus (or Dionysus/Iacchus) with Demeter, either explicitly or implicitly, as her son. The earliest such source, a 4th-century BC vase fragment at Oxford, shows Demeter holding the child Dionysus on her lap. Diodorus Siculus tells us about a &quot;second Dionysus&quot; (i.e. Dionysus Zagreus) who &quot;the writers of myths relate, was born to Zeus by Persephonê, though some say it was Demeter&quot;. By the 1st-century BC, Demeter suckling Iacchus had become such a commonplace, that the Latin poet Lucretius could use it as an apparently recognizable example of a lover&#x27;s euphemism. A scholiast on the 2nd-century AD Aristides, explicitly names Demeter as Iacchus&#x27; mother.

By other accounts apparently, Iacchus was the husband of Demeter. And according to Nonnus, Iacchus was the son of Dionysus and the nymph Aura, who was the daughter of the Titan Lelantos and the Oceanid Periboia (or Cybele?).

==The &quot;anasyrma&quot; of Baubo==
Iacchus was possibly involved in an Eleusinian myth concerning Demeter. Following the abduction by Hades of her daughter Persephone, Demeter visits Eleusis. Because she is in mourning for her lost daughter, Demeter refuses the offered hospitality of her Eleusinian hosts. Nevertheless, she is somehow made to laugh, and breaking her fast, finally accepts the offered food and drink. There are two versions of the story. In the earliest version, given in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot;, an old servant woman Iambe makes Demeter laugh by telling her obscene jokes. In an apparent later Orphic version of the story, the old woman Baubo makes Demeter laugh by lifting her skirts (an &quot;anasyrma&quot;) thereby exposing her genitals. One account of this second version, suggests the possible involvement of Iacchus. The 2nd-century Christian apologist Clement of Alexandria, in giving an account of this story, attributes the following lines of verse to Orpheus:
:This said, she drew aside her robes, and showed
:A sight of shame; child Iacchus was there,
:And laughing, plunged his hand below her breasts.
:Then smiled the goddess, in her heart she smiled,
:And drank the draught from out the glancing cup.

<text>Kykeon (, ; from , ; &quot;to stir, to mix&quot;) was an Ancient Greek drink of various descriptions. Some were made mainly of water, barley and naturally occurring substances. Others were made with wine and grated cheese. It is widely believed that kykeon usually refers to a psychoactive compounded brew, as in the case of the Eleusinian Mysteries. A kykeon was used at the climax of the Eleusinian Mysteries to break a sacred fast, but it is also mentioned as a favourite drink of Greek peasants.

==Ancient sources and description==
Kykeon is mentioned in Homeric texts: the Iliad describes it as consisting of Pramnian wine, barley, and grated goat&#x27;s cheese. In the Odyssey, Circe adds some honey and pours her magic potion into it. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, the goddess refuses red wine but accepts kykeon made from water, barley, and pennyroyal.

It was supposed to have digestive properties: In Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Peace&quot; Hermes recommends it to the hero who ate too much dry fruit and nuts.

Aristocrats shunned it as a peasant drink: Theophrastus&#x27; &quot;Characters&quot; depicts a peasant who goes to the Ecclesia drunk with kykeon.

==Eleusinian Mysteries==

In an attempt to solve the mystery of how so many people over the span of two millennia could have consistently experienced revelatory states during the culminating ceremony of the Eleusinian Mysteries, it has been posited that the barley used in the Eleusinian kykeon was parasitized by ergot, and that the psychoactive properties of that fungus triggered the intense experiences alluded to by the participants at Eleusis.

Discovery of fragments of ergot (fungi containing LSD-like psychedelic alkaloids) in a temple dedicated to the two Eleusinian goddesses excavated at the Mas Castellar site (Girona, Spain) provided some possible support for this theory. Ergot fragments were found inside a vase and within the dental calculus of a 25-year-old man, providing evidence of ergot being consumed. This finding seems to support the hypothesis of ergot as an ingredient of the Eleusinian kykeon.

<text>The Telesterion (&quot;Initiation Hall&quot; from Gr. τελείω, &quot;to complete, to fulfill, to consecrate, to initiate&quot;) was a great hall and sanctuary in Eleusis, one of the primary centers of the Eleusinian Mysteries. The hall had a fifty-five yard square roof that could cover three-thousand people, but no one revealed what happened during these events beyond there being &quot;something done, something said, and something shown&quot;. This building was built in the 7th century BCE and was an important site until it was destroyed in the 4th century CE. Devoted to Demeter and Persephone, these initiation ceremonies were the most sacred and ancient of all the religious rites celebrated in Greece.

== History ==
It is disputed when the site of the Telesterion is believed to have been originally built. There is evidence to suggest that the temple was created in the 7th century BCE, but historians know that it was created at least by the time of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (650–550 BCE). The construction of Telesterion took place in ten different phases.

It was destroyed by the Persians after the Battle of Thermopylae, when the Athenians withdrew to Salamis in 480 BCE and all of Boeotia and Attica fell to the Persian army, who captured and burnt Athens. After the defeat of the Persians, the Telesterion was intended to be reconstructed by Kimon, but it was instead rebuilt some time later due to Pericles&#x27; influence.

At some point in the 5th century BCE, Iktinos, the great architect of the Parthenon, built the Telesterion big enough to hold thousands of people. In about 318 BCE, Philon added a portico with twelve Doric columns.

The Telesterion continued to see use throughout the Roman period. In 170 CE, during the rule of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, an ancient tribe called the Costoboci launched an invasion of Roman territory south of the Danube, entering Thracia and ravaging the provinces of Macedonia and Achaea (Greece). The Costoboci reached as far south as Eleusis, where they destroyed the Telesterion. The emperor responded by dispatching general Vehilius Gratus Iulianus to Greece with emergency reinforcements, who eventually defeated the Costoboci. Marcus Aurelius then had the Telesterion rebuilt bigger than it had been before. Then only a few hundred years later in 396 CE, the forces of Alaric the Visigoth invaded the Eastern Roman Empire and ravaged Attica, destroying the Telesterion, which was never to be rebuilt.
===Religious use===
The Athenians used several calendars, each for different purposes. The festival of Eleusinia was celebrated each year in Eleusis and Athens for nine days from the 15th to the 23rd of the month of Boedromion (in September or October of the Gregorian calendar); because the festival calendar had 12 lunar months, the celebrations were not strictly calibrated to a year of 365 days. During the festival, Athens was crowded with visitors.

At the climax of the ceremonies at Eleusis, the initiates entered the Telesterion where they were shown the sacred relics of Demeter and the priestesses revealed their visions of the holy night (probably a fire that represented the possibility of life after death). This was the most secretive part of the Mysteries and those who had been initiated were forbidden to ever speak of the events that took place in the Telesterion.The origin of the ritual of the Eleusinia is from the myth of Persephone being taken to Hades in the underworld, while her mother Demeter frantically seeks her in the mortal world. After she learns that Zeus allowed the kidnapping to happen, she turns herself into an old women and wanders around the world until she reaches Eleusis, where she is taken in by the King&#x27;s daughters. She is overcome by grief, but she is given the Queen Metanira&#x27;s latest born child, Demophoon to nurse. He grows more than any other child, but his mother is afraid when he is put over a flame before he can be made fully immortal. Demeter gets angry, and tells her that since she robbed her son of immortality and angered her, the people of Eleusis must create a temple to her where they would do things to gain back her favor. Even after Demeter got her daughter back from Hades for part of the year, the Eleusinian Mysteries continued. It was said in myth that Herakles partook in the Eleusian Mysteries as part of his twelfth labor in which he captured Cerberus, and during them, he saw visions of both Persephone and Demeter.

Some temple use ceased during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, when all non-Christian sanctuaries were ordered closed by law initiated by the Christian emperors. However, it was not until the anti-pagan decree of Theodosius in around 390 CE that there was an end to all religious use of the temple.

<text>The Eumolpidae (, &quot;Eumolpidai&quot;) were a family of priests at Eleusis who maintained the Eleusinian Mysteries during the Hellenic era. As hierophants, they popularized the cult and allowed many more to be initiated into the secrets of Demeter and Persephone.

The legendary genealogy of the Eumolpidae cast them as descendants of Eumolpus, one of the first priests of Demeter at Eleusis, through his second son, Herald-Keryx. Eumolpus, &quot;untainted by blame&quot; is named among the archaic leaders of Eleusis in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot; 149–156. Through Eumolpus, they were supposedly related to either Poseidon or Hermes. The last legitimate hierophant at Eleusis, just before the extinguishing of the mysteries at the time of Alaric&#x27;s invasion in 396 CE, traced his descent from Eumolpos. The other family with a hereditary Eleusinian priesthood were the Kerykes.

<text>The kerykes or ceryces (, pl. of , &quot;Keryx&quot;) of Bronze Age Pylos 1200 BC, home to the aged Homeric hero Nestor and the Neleides, are listed in the Linear B tablets as &quot;ka-ru-ke&quot; serving the &quot;ra-wa-ko-ri&quot;, the commander of armed forces. In Athens, this office became ceremonial, functioning from the Leokoreion, a building site at the Dipylon Gate. Linear B tablets that refer to the &quot;keryx&quot; mention the office in context with &quot;e-ma-a2&quot; (&quot;e-ma-ha&quot;) &quot;a-re-ja&quot;, &quot;Hermes Areias&quot;, meaning either the Warrior, or the Curser (&quot;aras&quot;).

==Overview==
In &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Homeric epic, heralds serve heroic nobility in humble tasks, as cooks, fire-kindlers, wine-pourers, and waiters during feasts and symposia, as scavengers of corpses on the battlefield for cremation or as umpires during funeral games, as messengers between enemies, allies, and warriors during battle, as announcers of public assembly and as language translators (&quot;hermeneus&quot;), and in other odd jobs that earned them the rank of &quot;demiourgoi&quot;, public workers. Their ubiquitous yet invisible presence behind the scenes requires concentration, for to understand what they did demands a shift in focus, like watching the black and white striped referees in a football game, rather than the players competing and scoring. Accordingly, &quot;demiourgoi&quot; alone demonstrate declining status, hence the heraldic office itself declined in sanctity and authority, even though its exalted status survived in archaic Athens. Two of the most prominent kerykes were the Spartan herald Talthybios, and the Trojan herald Idaios, both being spear-carriers; they were known by the epithet &quot;pepnumenō&quot;.

By the archaic period 700-650 BC, Hesiod identifies Hermes with the herald of the Olympian gods that has special control over the daimonic winged Keres in-flight into and out of Demeter Pandora, personified wine-storage jars blamed for all of the ills of humans, where only Hope lingered at the rim. She was Demeter &quot;Anesidora&quot;, one aspect of the grain-goddess at Athens who preceded the revenge-filled Demeter Erinys &#x27;at Eleusis.The Homeric Hymn to Demeter (147) names her Maia, also the mother of Hermes Kêryx. The burial spot of herald Anthemokritos helps identify the larger grave-mound of the Athenian Kerykes with the massive Tomb 9 along the Eridanos River outside the Dipylon Gate.

By the classical period, the Kerykes, sons of Hermes, were one of the sacred Eleusinian families of priests that ran the Eleusinian Mysteries. They popularized the cult and allowed many more to be initiated into the great secrets of Demeter and Persephone, including the concoction &quot;kukeion,&quot; or &quot;kykeon&quot;. Starting about 300 BC, the state took over control of the Mysteries, specifically controlled by two families: the Eumolpidae and the Kerykes. This led to a vast increase in the number of initiates. The only requirements for membership were a lack of &quot;blood guilt&quot; (meaning having never committed murder) and not a barbarian (i.e. Greek and able to speak Greek). Men, women and even slaves were allowed to be initiated.

Kerykes (which means &quot;heralds&quot; in Greek), were also part of the ritual and competitors at the Olympic Games (see Herald and Trumpet contest).

<doc id="80627" wikidata="Q7715897" url="?curid=80627" title="Aaron Pryor vs. Alexis Argüello">
<text>[[Aaron Pryor]] vs. [[Alexis Argüello]], billed as The Battle of the Champions, was a boxing fight for the WBA world Junior Welterweight title. The contest&#x27;s nickname was coined by promoter Bob Arum, regarding the light welterweight boxing super match on November 12, 1982.

==Background==
Arguello had previously won three boxing titles (at Featherweight, Junior Lightweight and Lightweight) and hoped to become the first boxer ever to win world titles in four divisions by adding the Jr. Welterweight title. The broadcaster, HBO, had televised two of Arguello&#x27;s previous fights. Pryor had no previous telecasts on that network, despite a record of 31 wins and no losses, with 29 knockouts.

Both fighters had radically opposing public images. Arguello was suave, sophisticated, and extremely humble about his impressive accomplishments, which garnered him great admiration from both the boxing community and the media . Pryor, on the other hand, was fearsome, intimidating and, despite possessing great talent and having been a peer of greats Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns, was the recipient of limited media coverage.

==The fight==
The fight was beset with a number of controversies and odd happenings, the first coming before the bout started, when a man with a weapon tried to gain access to Arguello&#x27;s dressing room. He was stopped by members of the public, and Arguello was rushed by his handlers into a shower and shielded. The man later was arrested.

The fight began without further incident. A pattern quickly emerged, as right from the opening bell Pryor charged recklessly at Arguello with combinations, while Arguello stood still in the middle of the ring, parrying or blocking Pryor&#x27;s punches while counterattacking with his trademark precise, hard, straight punches. Both fighters were hurt in the first round, and each took the opportunity to punish each other.

The tone was set for the fight. Pryor tried to increase the tempo, moving more, punching more, hitting Arguello with slashing combinations while Arguello stayed true to his strategy, summarized before the fight as &quot;I don&#x27;t have to hit him many times in each round, but I do have to make sure that every time I hit him it hurts&quot;, waited for counterpunching opportunities and used both his own strength and Pryor&#x27;s momentum from coming forward to try to make every blow as explosive and painful as possible. In every round each fighter would have their high points, and every round became difficult to score.

For a time Pryor looked to be gaining control of the fight and winning a string of rounds in the middle of the fight, but Arguello came back in rounds 9 through 11, particularly in round 11 where he battered Pryor with a number very hard shots, seemingly shifting the momentum of the fight in favor of Arguello. However, controversy would now raise its head for a second time that evening.

Between rounds it was noticed that a second, thus far unused water bottle was put into use in Pryor&#x27;s corner. Pryor took control in the 12th round, but Arguello attempted to match him blow for blow. In the 13th round Arguello hit Pryor with a tremendous punch, easily the hardest blow of the fight, but Pryor danced away and out of trouble. Once again between rounds Pryor&#x27;s cornerman, Panama Lewis, could be heard requesting the second bottle, and telling an aide &quot;No, not that one, the one I mixed&quot;, when the aide offered the water bottle that had been used throughout the rest of the fight. That happened between the 13th and the 14th rounds, but Panama Lewis gave the mixed drink to Pryor as early as the 2nd round. Pryor battered Arguello around the ring for the first minute of the round, until a hard combination drove a staggering Arguello to the ropes, where Pryor proceeded to land a brutal series of almost twenty unanswered punches that nearly sent Arguello out of the ring. The proud Arguello refused to go down, until referee Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa stepped in to stop the fight, at which point Arguello collapsed to the canvas. His cornermen rushed to his side, afraid that Arguello had been seriously hurt.

==Aftermath==
The fight became known as the &quot;fight of the decade&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot;.

Both the oddities surrounding the water bottles and Pryor&#x27;s response to its use were noticed after the bout. It was also reported that Pryor did not undertake a drug test following the bout, his team responded that no-one had approached them for a urine sample. A rematch was ordered, which took place 10 months after the first bout. Both had different trainers for the rematch, with Arguello having fired Eddie Futch, blaming Futch for his loss. He later apologised to Futch, calling it &quot;the biggest mistake of my life&quot;. Pryor&#x27;s trainer Panama Lewis had lost his license for removing padding from Luis Resto&#x27;s gloves before his fight with Billy Collins Jr. As a result, Pryor hired Richie Giachetti to train him for the rematch, but they had disagreements and Pryor replaced him with Emanuel Steward.

In the rematch, Pryor won by a 10th-round knockout of another exciting contest where Pryor sent Arguello to the canvas three times but Arguello staggered Pryor briefly in the second round, and both fighters retired following the bout. Driven by financial problems and cocaine addictions, both would later come out of retirement. During his comeback, Arguello knocked out former champion Billy Costello in four rounds. Pryor was also largely successful in his comebacks, although he would suffer the only loss of his career in one of them. Eventually, it was discovered during a medical test that Pryor had significantly lost vision in one of his eyes, and after that he was denied a boxing license.

Arguello entered politics later in his native Nicaragua, while Aaron Pryor became a Christian minister. Both Arguello and Pryor are members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, and the two formed a deep friendship since their bout. Most notably, Pryor traveled to Nicaragua to support Arguello&#x27;s political career, and the two met several times a year until Arguello&#x27;s death, apparently by a self-inflicted gunshot, in 2009. Pryor died on October 9, 2016.

Arguello was the flag carrier for Nicaragua in the 2008 Summer Olympics.

In a 2009 documentary, former Lewis-trained boxer Luis Resto revealed that Panama Lewis would break apart antihistamine pills and pour the medicine into his water, giving him greater lung capacity in the later rounds of a fight. This revelation fueled further speculation as to whether Lewis had added an unsanctioned substance to Pryor&#x27;s water in his bout with Arguello.

<text>Elefsina () or Eleusis ( ; ) is a suburban city and municipality in Athens metropolitan area. It belongs to West Attica regional unit of Greece. It is located in the Thriasio Plain, at the northernmost end of the Saronic Gulf. North of Elefsina are Mandra and Magoula, while Aspropyrgos is to the northeast.

It is the site of the Eleusinian Mysteries and the birthplace of Aeschylus. Today, Elefsina is a major industrial centre, with the largest oil refinery in Greece as well as the home of the Aeschylia Festival, the longest-lived arts event in the Attica Region. On 11 November 2016, Elefsina was named the European Capital of Culture for 2021, which became effective in 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic postponement.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Eleusis&quot; first appears in the &quot;Orphic Hymn to Eleusinian Demeter&quot;: «Δήμητρος Ελευσινίας, θυμίαμα στύρακα». Also Hesychius of Alexandria reports that the older name for Eleusis was Saesara (Σαισάρια).

== History ==


=== Ancient ===

Eleusis was a deme of ancient Attica, belonging to the phyle Hippothoöntis. It owed its celebrity to its being the chief seat of the worship of Demeter and Persephone, and to the mysteries celebrated in honour of these goddesses, which were called the &quot;Eleusinia&quot;, and continued to be regarded as the most sacred of all the Grecian mysteries down to the fall of paganism.

Eleusis stood upon a height at a short distance from the sea, and opposite the island of Salamis. Its situation possessed three natural advantages. It was on the road from Athens to the Isthmus of Corinth; it was in a very fertile plain; and it was at the head of an extensive bay, formed on three sides by the coast of Attica, and shut in on the south by the island of Salamis. The town itself dates from the most ancient times.

The caves on the coast of Eleusis are home to a mythological place for the Greek world. There is a cave said to be the very spot where Persephone was abducted by Hades himself and the cave was considered a gateway to Tartarus. At the spot of this abduction was a sanctuary (Ploutonion) dedicated to Hades and Persephone.

The Rharian plain is also mentioned in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Artemis&quot;; it appears to have been in the neighbourhood of the city; but its site cannot be determined.

==== Mythology and Proto-history ====

It appears to have derived its name from the supposed advent (ἔλευσις) of Demeter, though some traced its name from an eponymous hero Eleusis. It was one of the 12 independent states into which Attica was said to have been originally divided.

&quot;When Athens had only just become Athens, it went to war with another city built thirteen miles away: Eleusis,&quot; Roberto Calasso wrote of the ancient provenance of the relationship between temple-city and the Attic seat of power. &quot;It was a war usually described as mythical, since it has no date. And it was a theological war, since Athens belonged to Athena and Eleusis to Poseidon. Eumolpus and Erechtheus, the founding kings of the two cities, both died in it.&quot;

It is related that in the reign of Eumolpus, king of Eleusis, and Erechtheus, king of Athens, there was a war between the two states, in which the Eleusinians were defeated, whereupon they agreed to acknowledge the supremacy of Athens in everything except the celebration of the mysteries, of which they were to continue to have the management. Eleusis afterwards became an Attic deme, but in consequence of its sacred character it was allowed to retain the title of &quot;polis&quot; (πόλις) and to coin its own money, a privilege possessed by no other town in Attica, except Athens. The history of Eleusis is part of the history of Athens. Once a year the great Eleusinian procession travelled from Athens to Eleusis, along the Sacred Way.

==== Eleusinian Mysteries ====




Eleusis was the site of the Eleusinian Mysteries, or the Mysteries of Demeter and Kore, which became popular in the Greek-speaking world as early as 600 BC, and attracted initiates during Roman Empire before declining mid-late 4th century AD. These Mysteries revolved around a belief that there was a hope for life after death for those who were initiated. Such a belief was cultivated from the introduction ceremony in which the hopeful initiates were shown a number of things including the seed of life in a stalk of grain. The central myth of the Mysteries was Demeter&#x27;s quest for her lost daughter (Kore the Maiden, or Persephone) who had been abducted by Hades. It was here that Demeter, disguised as an old lady who was abducted by pirates in Crete, came to an old well where the four daughters of the local king Keleos and his queen Metaneira (Kallidike, Kleisidike, Demo and Kallithoe) found her and took her to their palace to nurse the son of Keleos and Metaneira, Demophoon. Demeter raised Demophoon, anointing him with nectar and ambrosia and placing him at night in the fire in order to endow him with immortality, until Metaneira found out and insulted her. Demeter arose insulted, and casting off her disguise, and, in all her glory, instructed Meteneira to build a temple to her. Keleos, informed the next morning by Metaneira, ordered the citizens to build a rich shrine to Demeter, where she sat in her temple until the lot of the world prayed to Zeus to make the world provide food again.

The Great Eleusian relief which was famous in antiquity and was copied in the Roman period, is the largest and most important votive relief found and dates to 440-430 BC. It represents the Eleusinian deities in a scene depicting a mysterious ritual. On the left Demeter, clad in a peplos and holding a sceptre in her left hand, offers ears of wheat to Triptolemos, son of Eleusinian king Keleos, to bestow on mankind. On the right Persephone, clad in chiton and mantle and holding a torch, blesses Triptolemos with her right hand. The original marble relief was found at the sanctuary of Demeter, the site of the Eleusinian mysteries. A number of Roman copies also survive.

==== Greek and Roman History ====

During the Greco-Persian Wars, the ancient temple of Demeter was burnt down by the Persians in 484 BC; and it was not until the administration of Pericles that an attempt was made to rebuild it. When the power of the Thirty Tyrants was overthrown after the Peloponnesian War, they retired to Eleusis, which they had secured beforehand, but where they maintained themselves for only a short time.

The town of Eleusis and its immediate neighbourhood were exposed to inundations from the river Cephissus, which, though almost dry during the greater part of the year, is sometimes swollen to such an extent as to spread itself over a large part of the plain. Demosthenes (384 – 322 BC) alludes to inundations at Eleusis;

Pausanias () has left us only a very brief description of Eleusis;
Under the Romans Eleusis enjoyed great prosperity, as initiation into its mysteries became fashionable among the Roman nobles.

Hadrian was initiated into the Mysteries in about 125 and raised embankments in the plain of the river in consequence of a flood which occurred while he was spending the winter at Athens.

To the same emperor most likely Eleusis was indebted for a supply of good water by means of the aqueduct, completed in about 160 AD. Apart from satisfying the need for drinking water, it also enabled the construction of public fountains and baths. It was fed by springs in Mount Parnitha and used mainly underground tunnels. It crossed the Thriasian Plain and turned abruptly towards the south at the outskirts of Eleusis. The best visible remains are on the east side of Dimitros Street.

It was destroyed by Alaric I in 396 AD, and from that time disappears from history.

===Monuments===

The Telesterion, or temple of Demeter, was the largest in all Greece, and is described by Strabo as capable of containing as many persons as a theatre. The building was initially designed by Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon at Athens; but it was many years before it was completed, and the names of several architects are preserved who were employed in building it. 

During its long history, the temple underwent subsequent building phases. Much of that visible today is of the Classical era (5th century BC). Its portico of 12 columns was added in the time of Demetrius Phalereus, about 318 BC, by the architect Philo. When finished, it was considered one of the four finest examples of Grecian architecture in marble.

Modifications were also carried out in Roman times (2nd c. AD).

The Roman bridge that carried the ancient Sacred Way over the Kephissus river is visible about 1 km from the Sanctuary of Demeter. The bridge is in very good condition and is an outstanding example of ancient bridge building. It consists of a central 30 m-long main bridge with 4 arches and 10 m-long sloping access on either side.

The Sacred Way was the main road from Athens and led to Demeter&#x27;s sanctuary, and was also the road used by the procession every year of the celebration of the Great Mysteries escorting the sacred objects back to Eleusis. Its course is visible in some places and has been accurately traced by rescue excavations and ran parallel to its namesake in the modern city only a few metres to the south. Roadside cemeteries from different periods throughout antiquity are found next to it and prehistoric graves witness its existence by 1600 BC. During the Hellenistic and mainly Roman eras the road was used for the exhibition of wealth and social power, with costly burial monuments being erected all along it. The road was in use until at least the 6th century AD.

=== Medieval and early Modern era ===

It is indicative that writers of the Byzantine era refer to it as a &quot;small village&quot;, and shortly before the Ottoman domination the area was deserted by wars, raids and captives. During this period was settled by Arvanites. European travelers during the Ottoman domination described Eleusis as having few inhabitants and many ancient ruins.

=== Modern Elefsina ===

In 1829, after the Greek War of Independence, Elefsina was a small settlement of about 250 inhabitants. By the late 19th century Elefsina changed drastically as new buildings were erected by the new merchant settlers. Also during that period Eleusis became one of the main industrial centers of the Modern Greek state with concrete factory TITAN, Charilaou Soap Factory as well as the distilleries of Botrys and Kronos being established in the area.

Arvanitika is still spoken in the village, with the locals qualifying their dialect more &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;refined&quot; than those of rural Arvanites. 
Many Greek families of Asia Minor settled in Elefsina after the 1922 Asia Minor Catastrophe and created the settlement of Upper Elefsina, doubling its total population and enriching the region culturally and economically.

During the Axis occupation of Greece (1941–1945), strong resistance developed within the city, the factories and the military airport, which once stationed Squadron 80, the squadron that Roald Dahl was assigned to in the RAF. After World War II, workers from all parts of Greece moved to Elefsina to work in the industries in the region. Industrial activity, however, developed anarchically on the antiquities and next to the residential area.

Environmental pollution has taken on large dimensions. During the 20th century, at the time of sustainable development, archaeological discoveries and industrial formation shaped the image of contemporary Eleusis.

In 1962, a large house of priests from the Roman era was discovered. Pollution thanks to citizens&#x27; struggles gradually has fallen.

Today, the city has become a suburb of Athens, to which it is linked by the A6 motorway and Greek National Road 8. Eleusis is nowadays a major industrial area, and the place where the majority of crude oil in Greece is imported and refined. The largest refinery is located on the west side of town, right beside where the annual Aeschylia Festival is held in honor of the great tragic poet Aeschylus.

Elefsis Shipyards is located here.

There is a military airport a few kilometers east of Elefsina. Elefsina Airfield played a crucial role in the final British evacuation during the 1941 Battle of Greece, as recounted by Roald Dahl in his autobiography &quot;Going Solo&quot;.

Elefsina is home to the football club Panelefsiniakos F.C., and the basketball club Panelefsiniakos B.C.

== Aeschylia Festival ==
Established in 1975, the Aeschylia Festival in Eleusis in Western Attica is the currently the longest standing cultural event organized by an Attica Municipality. It is held annually at Palaio Elaiourgeio, a former soap factory by the seafront that functions as an open theatre. The festival usually begins at the end of August and runs through September. The event is organized in honor of the ancient Greek tragedian Aeschylus, who was born in Eleusis, and derives its name from him. It includes stage productions, art exhibitions and installations, concerts, and dance events.

== Climate ==
Elefsina has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;), bordering on a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) for the 1958-2010 period, according to the meteorological station operated by the Hellenic National Meteorological Service. Elefsina is particularly hot during the summer, with an average July maximum of . According to Kassomenos and Katsoulis (2006), based on 12 years of data (1990–2001), the industrialization of west Attica, where at least 40% of the industrial activity of the country is concentrated, could be the cause of the warm climate of the zone. On 4 June 2024 the WMO station in the port of Elefsina broke the record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Greece for the first 10 days of June from the National Observatory of Athens network. 

=== European temperature record ===
Until 2021, Elefsina was one of the areas in the Athens Metropolitan Area (the other one was Tatoi) which held the record of the highest ever officially recorded temperature in Europe for 44 years with a reading of on 10 July 1977.

== Hospitals and medical centres ==

Elefsina has a general hospital the Thriassio General Hospital, located 3.9 km north of the city centre. Administratively, it belongs to the municipal unit of Magoula. In addition, Elefsina has a health center which is located in the centre of the town.

<doc id="80630" wikidata="Q912105" url="?curid=80630" title="Wubi method">
<text>The Wubizixing input method (), often abbreviated to simply Wubi or Wubi Xing, is a Chinese character input method primarily for inputting simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese text on a computer. Wubi should not be confused with the Wubihua (五笔画) method, which is a different input method that shares the categorization into five types of strokes.

The method is also known as Wang Ma (), named after the inventor Wang Yongmin (王永民). There are four Wubi versions that are considered to be standard: Wubi 86, Wubi 98, Wubi 18030 and Wubi New-century (the 3rd-generation Version). The latter three can also be used to input traditional Chinese text, albeit in a more limited way. Wubi 86 is the most widely known and used shape-based input method for full letter keyboards in Mainland China. If it is frequently needed to input traditional Chinese characters as well, other input methods like Cangjie or Zhengma may be better suited to the task, and it is also much more likely to find them on the computer one needs to use.

The Wubi method is based on the structure of characters rather than their pronunciation, making it possible to input characters even when the user does not know the pronunciation, as well as not being too closely linked to any particular spoken variety of Chinese. It is also extremely efficient: nearly every character can be written with at most 4 keystrokes. In practice, most characters can be written with fewer. There are reports of experienced typists reaching 160 characters per minute with Wubi. What this means in the context of Chinese is not entirely the same as it is for English, but it is true that Wubi is extremely fast when used by an experienced typist. The main reason for this is that, unlike with traditional phonetic input methods, one does not have to spend time selecting the desired character from a list of homophonic possibilities: virtually all characters have a unique representation.

As its name suggests, the keyboard is divided into five regions. The Chinese character (bǐ), when used in the context of writing Chinese characters, refers to the brush strokes used in Chinese calligraphy. Each region is assigned a certain type of stroke.

* Region 1: horizontal (一)
* Region 2: vertical (丨)
* Region 3: downward right-to-left (丿)
* Region 4: dot strokes or downward left-to-right strokes (丶)
* Region 5: hook (乙)

As a more complex system, Wubi takes longer to acquire as a skill. Memorization and practice are key factors for proficient usage.

To use Wubi, there are multiple input methods available, including Google Input Tools (used by Google Translate) and keyboard options on Mac devices. Wubi sequences can be looked up for specific characters by using online dictionaries. 

In this article, the following convention will be used: &quot;character&quot; will always mean Chinese character, whereas &quot;letter&quot;, &quot;key&quot; and &quot;keystroke&quot; will always refer to the keys on keyboard.

== How it works ==

Essentially, a character is broken down into components, which are usually (but not always) the same as radicals. These are typed in the order in which they would be written by hand. In order to ensure that extremely complex characters do not require an inordinate number of keystrokes, any character containing more than 4 components is entered by typing the first 3 components written, followed by the last. In this way, each character&#x27;s data can be entered with no more than 4 keystrokes.

Wubi distributes its characters very evenly and as such the vast majority of characters are uniquely defined by the 4 keystrokes discussed above. One then types a space to move the character from the input buffer onto the screen. In the event that the 4 letter representation of the character is &quot;not&quot; unique, one would type a digit to select the relevant character (for example, if two characters have the same representation, typing 1 would select the first, and 2 the second). In most implementations, a space can always be typed and simply means 1 in an ambiguous setting. Intelligent software will try to make sure that the character in the default position is the one desired.

Many characters have more than one representation. This sometimes is for ease of use, in case there is more than one obvious way to break down a character. More often though, it is because certain characters have a short representation that is less than 4 letters, as well as a &quot;full&quot; representation.

For characters with fewer than 4 components that do not have a short form representation, one types each component and then &quot;fills up&quot; the representation (that is, types enough extra keystrokes to make the representation 4 keystrokes) by manually typing the strokes of the last component, in the order they would be written. If there are too many strokes, one should write as many as possible, but put the last stroke last (this mirrors the component rule for characters with more than 4 components outlined above).

Once the algorithm is understood, one can type almost any character with a little practice, even if one has not typed it before. Muscle memory ensures that frequent typists using this method do not have to think about how the characters are actually constructed, just as the vast majority of English typists do not think very much about the spelling of words when they write.

== Implementation of specific details ==

Many implementations employ further, multiple-word optimizations. Usually, a commonly used digraph (two character word) in which both characters have short form two-keystroke representations can be combined into a single, four keystroke representation which generates two characters rather than one. There are also a few 3-character shortcuts, and even one rather longer, politically motivated one. Some examples of these are provided in the examples section below.

Another common feature is the use of the &#x27;z&#x27; key as a wildcard. The Wubi method was actually designed with this feature in mind; this is why no components are assigned to the z key. Basically, one can type a z when unsure what the component should be, and the input method will help complete it. If one knew, for example, that the character ought to start with &quot;kt&quot;, but was unsure what the next component should be, typing &quot;ktz&quot; would produce a list of all characters starting with &quot;kt&quot;. In practice though, many input method engines use a tabular lookup method for all table based input systems, including for Wubi. This means that they simply have a large table in memory, associating different characters to their respective representations. The input method then simply becomes a table lookup. In such an implementation, the z key breaks the paradigm and as such is not found in much generalized software (although the Wubi input method commonly found in Chinese Windows implements the feature). For this same reason, the multiple character optimization described in the previous paragraph is also relatively rare.

Some input methods, such as xcin (found on many UNIX-like systems), provide a generic wildcard functionality which can be used in all the table based input systems, including pinyin and virtually anything else. Xcin uses &#x27;*&#x27; for auto-complete and &#x27;?&#x27; for just one letter, following the conventions pioneered in UNIX file globbing. Other implementations have their own conventions.

== Subdivision of the keyboard ==

The Wubi keyboard assumes a QWERTY-like layout, so users of keyboards implementing a nationalized or alternative layout (such as Dvorak or the French AZERTY) will probably have to do some remapping to make the system sane. Wubi does not position its components arbitrarily: there are far too many of them, and it is only with the introduction of a logical methodology that the system becomes easy to learn.

Basically, the keyboard is divided into 5 zones, each representing a stroke. Those five strokes are falling left, falling right, horizontal, vertical, and hook, and the zones that represent them are QWERT, YUIOP, ASDFG, HJKLM, and
XCVBN, respectively. These zones are all laid out horizontally, with the exception of M, which is not in line with the rest of the letters in its zone.

In a general way, the keyboard can be thought of as divided down the center, between T and Y, G and H, and N and M. The keys in each zone are numbered moving away from this dividing line: so we should actually say that in zone QWERT, T is the first letter, R is the second, and E the third; in zone YUIOP, Y is the first, U is the second, I the third, etc. For XCVBN, N is the first, and so on. In HJKLM, consider M to be the last in the series, even though it does not lie on the line.

This is important because components in the first position will have one repetition of the stroke in question (the stroke assigned to the zone in which they belong), those in the second, two, those in the third, three. Those components which are not easily classifiable using this paradigm will be placed on the last letter.

Therefore, one would expect 一 to be located on G, and 二 on F, and 三 on D, and indeed, this is the case. Similarly, one would expect 丨 to be located on H, 刂 to be on J, and 川 to be on K. This pattern holds for all the zones. Furthermore, it extends to most radicals that look as though they are made up of three such strokes, even if in fact they might not be at all. An example of this is 中 on K: while it does not have three downward strokes (two only), it appears to have three. Furthermore, it is written by hand by first writing a mouth radical, 口, and then bisecting it with a vertical downward stroke. The mouth radical lies on &#x27;K&#x27;, so this makes the assignment doubly logical. And the pinyin romanization of 口, kou3, begins with k, another memory aid encoded into the Wubi keyboard.

Furthermore, each letter of each zone has one component associated with it, its &quot;main component&quot;. These are usually a complete character (with the exception of X) in their own right. One can always type this main component by typing the letter it is situated on four times. So, for example, the main component of H is 目, and so one would type it by typing &quot;hhhh&quot;.

Each letter also has a shortcut character associated with it. In some cases, this character is the same as the component associated with the key in question, and sometimes not. This shortcut character is the character produced when one types just the letter and nothing else; these are all extremely common characters used when typing Chinese.

&quot;It is entirely possible that there are a number of components not listed below, either because of oversight, because they are rarely used, or because no simple Unicode representation for the component exists.&quot;

=== QWERT zone (falling left) ===

The Q key&#x27;s main component is 金 and its shortcut character is 我. It is associated with the following components: 金, 钅, 勹, 儿, 夕, as well as the hook at the top of 饣 and 角, the radical 犭 &quot;without the lower left-falling stroke&quot; (so characters with that radical start with &quot;qt&quot;, not just &quot;q&quot;), the criss-cross (such as in the center of 区), the top of 鱼 (i.e., without the horizontal stroke at the bottom), and the three (nearly vertical) &quot;feet&quot; in the bottom right corner of 流.

The W key&#x27;s main component and shortcut character are both 人. It is associated with the following components: 人, 亻, 八, and the top of 癸. While 人 means person, it is often used by Wubi to construct a roof radical, such as in 会, &quot;wfc&quot;. 入 is not governed by W, despite looking similar, and while 餐 has a top that looks vaguely like the top of 癸, the two are not the same (indeed, to type 餐, one must physically type out each component on the top).

The E key&#x27;s main component is 月, and its shortcut character is 有. It is associated with the following components: 月, 用, 彡, 乃, the bottom of 衣 (i.e., without 亠), the top of 孚 (i.e., without 子), 豕 (hog), the bottom of 良 (i.e., without the 白), and the bottom of 舟 (i.e., without the little dot on the top). In this case, E&#x27;s shortcut character does not even begin with a left-falling stroke, but merely prominently figures a component belonging to E. 彡 is featured on this character, as it is the third character in the zone (counting from T, see above). A particular distortion that comes up often is the use of E in 且 and in characters containing it: Wubi thinks of this component as 月 + 一.

The R key&#x27;s main component is 白, and its shortcut character is 的. It is associated with the following components: 白, 手, 扌, 斤 (both with and without the T), 牛 (&quot;without&quot; the vertical downward stroke), and of course the two left-falling strokes 𰀪 that one would expect from the second key in the zone (see above for an explanation). Watch out for varieties of 手 where the central downward hook is replaced by a left-falling stroke, such as in
看.

The T key&#x27;s main component is 禾, and its shortcut character is 和. It is associated with the following components: 禾, 竹, 夂, 攵, 彳, and the top of 乞 (i.e., without the 乙). 竹 may also be found in its smaller form (⺮). 丿 is also found on this key, because T is the first key in the zone (see above). This means that if one is typing a component or character stroke by stroke, they would (generally) use T to represent a left-falling stroke. See the section on disambiguation strokes for more information on exceptions to this rule.

=== YUIOP zone (falling right) ===

This zone might also be called the dot zone, because its pattern of Y: 讠 U: 冫 I: 氵 and O: 灬 is not actually necessarily built up of right falling strokes. In fact, one could argue that the first stroke in 灬 actually falls &quot;left&quot;. It is called the falling right zone because the keys in this zone, when used to construct a character by stroke (rather than component), all represent right falling strokes for some character configuration (see the section on disambiguation strokes for more information).

The Y key&#x27;s main component is 言, and its shortcut character is 主. It is associated with the following components: 言, 讠, 亠, 亠 with a 口 beneath it, 广, 文, 方, and 丶. These components all start with a right-falling stroke. Generally, dots in Chinese characters are actually &quot;left&quot; falling strokes, and so most of the time, the use of T is more appropriate than Y. Of course, if one can write Chinese characters by hand, they should be able to tell which to choose by recalling how it is written.

The U key&#x27;s main component is 立, and its shortcut character is 产. It is associated with the following components: 立, 六, 辛, 门, 疒, 丬, 冫, the &quot;antennae&quot; on the top of 单 (just two strokes: 丷), and the antennae plus a horizontal stroke, as found on the top of 兹. Most of these all feature two short diagonal strokes (门 being the obvious exception). This is consistent with U&#x27;s place as the second letter in the zone (see above for an explanation).

The I key&#x27;s main component is 水, and its shortcut character is 不. It is associated with the following components: 水, 氵, 小, the three strokes on the top of 学, and the three strokes on the top of 当. Additionally, a component which might be described as two 冫, back to back, is associated with this character.

The O key&#x27;s main component is 火, and its shortcut character is 为. It is associated with the following components: 火, 米, 灬, and 业 &quot;without&quot; the bottom horizontal stroke — this allows construction of characters such as 严. This is the 4th key in the falling right zone: hence the inclusion of 灬.

The P key&#x27;s main component is 之, and its shortcut character is 这. It is associated with the following components: 之, 辶, 廴, 冖, 宀, and 礻. As Wubi components are typed in the order that they would need to be written were one writing by hand, the 辶 and 廴 components are typically typed &quot;last&quot;.

=== ASDFG zone (horizontal) ===
* The A key&#x27;s shortcut character is 工.
* The S key&#x27;s main component is 木, and its shortcut character is 要.
* The D key&#x27;s main component is 大, and its shortcut character is 在.
* The F key&#x27;s main component is 土, and its shortcut character is 地. The main component&#x27;s name (earth) correlates to the shortcut character which means earth.
* The G key&#x27;s main component is 王, and its shortcut character is 一.

=== HJKLM zone (vertical) ===
* The H key&#x27;s main component is 目, and its shortcut character is 上.
* The J key&#x27;s main component is 日, and its shortcut character is 是.
* The K key&#x27;s main component is 口, and its shortcut character is 中.
* The L key&#x27;s main component is 田, and its shortcut character is 国.
* The M key&#x27;s main component is 山, and its shortcut character is 同.

=== XCVBN zone (hook) ===
* The X key&#x27;s main component is 纟, and its shortcut character is 经.
* The C key&#x27;s main component is 又, and its shortcut character is 以.
* The V key&#x27;s main component is 女, and its shortcut character is 发.
* The B key&#x27;s main component is 子, and its shortcut character is 了.
* The N key&#x27;s main component is 已, and its shortcut character is 民.

== Disambiguation strokes ==

Strokes of keyboard is divided into 5 zones &lt;br&gt;
== Examples ==

=== Characters with 4 components or fewer (but no need for strokes) ===
Example 1: 请
Consists of three components: y (讠, radical #10), g (王*, radical 89), e (月, radical 118) → 请

=== Characters with more than four components ===
Example 2: 遗

Consists of five components: k (口), h (丨), g (一), m (贝), p (辶) → khgp → 遗 (it is not necessary to type m)

=== Characters with fewer than 4 components (needing strokes) ===
Example 3a: 文: First you type the key with the symbol on it, which happens to be &#x27;Y&#x27;. Then you type the first component, which is also &#x27;Y&#x27; for the 点 stroke, then a &#x27;G&#x27; for the 横 stroke，and since you now already have three strokes, you type the last stroke, which also happens to be a 捺, arriving at the keycode &#x27;YYGY&#x27; for the complete character.

Example 3b: 一: The code for this character is &#x27;GGLL&#x27;. As before, you type the key for the character first, which is &#x27;G&#x27;, then the first stroke of that character, which is also a &#x27;G&#x27;. Because this is all necessary information, the L is used as a filler until you reach 4 letters. Note that the &#x27;一&#x27; is also the shortcut character for &#x27;G&#x27; (making it one stroke only in practice).

Example 3c: 广: The code for this character is &#x27;YYGT&#x27;. At first, you type the key where this character is located, which is a &#x27;Y&#x27;. Then, you type a 点 stroke, which is also on &#x27;Y&#x27;. The next will be the 横 stroke on &#x27;G&#x27;, and the last will be the 捺, on &#x27;T&#x27;.

=== Characters requiring disambiguation strokes ===
Example 4: 等

Consists of three components: t (竹), f (土), f (寸),

Disambiguation strokes: The last stroke is 丶 and the character is with top-bottom structure (42,u) → 等

So the character code for 等 is &#x27;TFFU&#x27;

== Poem ==
A poem was made as a mnemonic for the Wubi keyboard, associating few characters with each key. The first character is the corresponding key main component, while the next ones are components or associated characters.

=== 1986 version ===
=== 1998 version ===
===New-century (3rd-generation) version===
== In media ==
In 2020, the history of Wubi was featured in a &quot;Radiolab&quot; episode titled &quot;The Wubi Effect&quot;.

<doc id="80646" wikidata="Q210428" url="?curid=80646" title="Elliott Smith">
<text>Steven Paul Smith (August 6, 1969 – October 21, 2003), known as Elliott Smith, was an American musician and singer-songwriter. He was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and lived much of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he gained popularity. Smith&#x27;s primary instrument was the guitar, though he also played piano, clarinet, bass guitar, drums, and harmonica. He had a distinctive vocal style in his solo career after Heatmiser, characterized by his &quot;whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery&quot;, and often used multi-tracking to create vocal layers, textures, and harmonies that were usually finger picked and recorded with tape.

After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994, with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars (KRS). In 1997, he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded his final two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song &quot;Miss Misery&quot;—included in the soundtrack for the film &quot;Good Will Hunting &quot;(1997)—was nominated for the 1998 Academy Award for Best Original Song.

A heavy drinker and drug user, Smith was also diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. His struggle with drugs and mental illness affected his life and work, and often informed his lyrics. He died at his Los Angeles home from two stab wounds to the chest at age 34 in 2003. The autopsy evidence did not determine whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his album &quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot;, posthumously produced and released in 2004.

== Early life ==
Steven Paul Smith was born on August 6, 1969, at the Methodist Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, the only child of Gary Smith, a student at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Bunny Kay Berryman, an elementary school music teacher. His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to Duncanville, Texas. He had half-siblings through his mother, Darren Welch and Ashley Welch, and a half-sister Rachel Smith through his father. Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t get it because I like Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won&#x27;t forget about it, although I&#x27;m tempted to because I don&#x27;t like it there.&quot;

Smith endured a difficult childhood and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie Welch. Smith stated he may have been sexually abused by Welch at a young age—an allegation denied by Welch. He wrote about this part of his life in &quot;Some Song&quot;. The name &quot;Charlie&quot; also appears in songs &quot;Flowers for Charlie&quot; and &quot;No Confidence Man&quot;. In a 2004 interview, Jennifer Chiba, Smith&#x27;s partner at the time of his death, said that Smith&#x27;s difficult childhood was partly why he needed to sedate himself with drugs as an adult: &quot;He was remembering traumatic things from his childhood – parts of things. It&#x27;s not my place to say what.&quot;

For much of his childhood, Smith&#x27;s family was a part of the Community of Christ but began attending services at a local Methodist church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him &quot;really scared of Hell&quot;. In 2001, he said: &quot;I don&#x27;t necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it.&quot;

Smith began playing piano at age nine, and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father. At this age he composed an original piano piece, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, which won him a prize at an arts festival. Many of the people on his mother&#x27;s side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer, and his grandmother sang in a glee club.

At fourteen, Smith left his mother&#x27;s home in Texas and moved to Portland, Oregon, to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith began using drugs, including alcohol, with friends. He also began experimenting with recording for the first time after borrowing a four-track recorder. At high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and played guitar and piano; he also sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction and A Murder of Crows, billed as either Steven Smith or &quot;Johnny Panic&quot;. His bandmates included Jason Hornick. He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar.

After graduation, Smith began calling himself &quot;Elliott&quot;, saying that he thought &quot;Steve&quot; sounded too much like a &quot;jock&quot; name, and that &quot;Steven&quot; sounded &quot;too bookish&quot;. According to friends, he had also used the pseudonym &quot;Elliott Stillwater-Rotter&quot; during his time in the band A Murder of Crows. Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that the name was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates Smith changed his name so as not to be confused with Steve Smith, the drummer of Journey.

== Career ==

=== 1991–1996: Heatmiser ===
In 1991 Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts with a degree in philosophy and political science. &quot;Went straight through in four years&quot;, he explained to &quot;Under the Radar&quot; in 2003. &quot;I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn&#x27;t want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, &#x27;This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.&#x27; Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day.&quot; After he graduated, he &quot;worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy and legal theory&quot;.

While at Hampshire College, Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After Smith graduated from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums &quot;Dead Air&quot; (1993) and &quot;Cop and Speeder&quot; (1994), as well as the &quot;Yellow No. 5&quot; EP (1994) on Frontier Records. They were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album &quot;Mic City Sons&quot; (1996).

Around this time, Smith and Gust worked a number of odd jobs around Portland, including installing drywall, spreading gravel, transplanting bamboo trees, and painting the roof of a warehouse with heat reflective paint. The pair were also on unemployment benefits for some time, which they considered an &quot;artist grant&quot;.

Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to the release of &quot;Mic City Sons&quot;, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm Caroline Records. A clause in Heatmiser&#x27;s record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought out by DreamWorks prior to the recording of his album &quot;XO&quot;.

=== 1994: &quot;Roman Candle&quot; ===
In the early 1990s, Smith&#x27;s girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of songs he had recently recorded on a borrowed four-track to Cavity Search Records. Cavity owner Christopher Cooper asked to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was expecting only a deal for a seven-inch record. The album became Smith&#x27;s release &quot;Roman Candle&quot; (1994).

Smith said: &quot;I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular ... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed [Heatmiser], unfortunately.&quot; Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: &quot;The idea of playing [my music] for people didn&#x27;t occur to me ... because at the time it was the Northwest—Mudhoney and Nirvana—and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.&quot;

One of Smith&#x27;s first solo performances was in Portland at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from &quot;Roman Candle&quot; were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set being B-sides, Heatmiser tunes and unreleased tracks. The same year, Smith released a split 7-inch record with Pete Krebs via Slo-Mo Records, contributing the track &quot;No Confidence Man&quot;.

=== 1995–1997: &quot;Elliott Smith&quot; and &quot;Either/Or&quot; ===
In 1995, Smith&#x27;s self-titled album was released on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a style of recording similar to &quot;Roman Candle&quot;, but with hints of growth and experimentation. Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and The Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on &quot;St. Ides Heaven&quot;, and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on &quot;Single File&quot;. Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album&#x27;s pervasive mood gave him &quot;a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person&quot; and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.

In 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film &quot;Lucky Three: An Elliott Smith Portrait&quot;. Two of these songs would appear on his next album &quot;Either/Or&quot;, which was another Kill Rock Stars release. &quot;Either/Or&quot; came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass guitar, drums, keyboards, and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, whose works generally deal with themes such as existential despair, angst, death, and God.

By this time, Smith&#x27;s already-heavy drinking was being compounded with use of antidepressants. At the end of the &quot;Either/Or&quot; tour, some of his close friends staged an intervention in Chicago, but it proved ineffective. Shortly after, Smith relocated from Portland to Jersey City, New Jersey, and later Brooklyn, New York.

=== 1997–1998: &quot;Miss Misery&quot; and Academy Award nomination ===
In 1997, Smith was selected by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant to be a part of the soundtrack to his film &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. Smith recorded an orchestral version of &quot;Between the Bars&quot; with composer Danny Elfman for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, and three previously released tracks (&quot;No Name #3&quot;, from &quot;Roman Candle&quot;, and &quot;Angeles&quot; and &quot;Say Yes&quot;, from &quot;Either/Or&quot;). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Miss Misery&quot;. Not eager to step into the limelight, he agreed to perform the song at the ceremony only after the producers informed him that if he was unwilling to perform, they would choose someone else to play it.

On March 5, 1998, Smith made an appearance on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; performing &quot;Miss Misery&quot; solo on acoustic guitar. A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Academy Awards ceremony, accompanied by the house orchestra. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning. He described the experience as surreal, and said: &quot;The Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn&#x27;t come to hear me play. I wouldn&#x27;t want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day.&quot;

=== 1998–2000: &quot;XO&quot; and &quot;Figure 8&quot; ===
In 1998, after the success of &quot;Either/Or&quot; and &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, Smith signed to a bigger record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, speaking openly of considering suicide, and on at least one occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall. When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer &quot;Yeah, I jumped off a cliff, but let&#x27;s talk about something else.&quot;

Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released &quot;Roman Candle&quot;), said about this time in Smith&#x27;s life, &quot;I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland, Oregon. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him.&quot; Pete Krebs also agreed: &quot;In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott&#x27;s initial depression ... Lots of people have stories of their own experiences of staying up with Elliott &#x27;til five in the morning, holding his hand, telling him not to kill himself.&quot;

Smith&#x27;s first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled &quot;XO&quot;, it was conceived and developed while Smith wrote it out over the winter of 1997/1998, night after night seated at the bar in Luna Lounge. It was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. &quot;XO&quot; also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion. It contained a more full-sounding, baroque pop sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, Chamberlins, elaborate string arrangements, and even a drum loop on the song &quot;Independence Day&quot;. His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style were still apparent while his somewhat personal lyrical style survived. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 123 on the UK Album Charts, while selling 400,000 copies (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career. Smith&#x27;s backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group Quasi, consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes&#x27;s ex-wife Janet Weiss on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass guitar, guitar, or backing vocals. On October 17, 1998, Smith appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and performed &quot;Waltz No. 2 (XO)&quot;. His backing band for this appearance was John Moen, Jon Brion, Rob Schnapf, and Sam Coomes.

In response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said, &quot;I think despite the fact that sometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they&#x27;re actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there&#x27;s a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music.&quot; Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting. It was during this period that Smith appeared on Dutch television in 1998 and provided a candid interview in which he spoke of his assessment of his music career until that point:

Yeah, I don&#x27;t know. I mean, I mostly only know things are different because people ask me different questions, but I don&#x27;t feel like things are very changed. I mean, I still, I do the same things that I did before … I think about the same things, so … I&#x27;m the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.

As part of the Dutch television special, Smith played live versions of &quot;Waltz No. 2 (XO)&quot;, &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, and &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Understand&quot;—the latter two songs were performed solely on piano, while the first song was cut short by Smith, as he explained: &quot;I had to stop it because it&#x27;s… you know, what&#x27;s the point of playing a song badly? It&#x27;d be better to play it and mean it, than to just walk through it.&quot;

Smith relocated from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1999, taking up residence at a cabin in the Silver Lake section of town, where he would regularly play intimate, acoustic shows at local venues like Silverlake Lounge. He also performed in Toronto in April that year. In the fall, his cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Because&quot; was featured in the end credits of DreamWorks&#x27; Oscar-winning drama &quot;American Beauty&quot;, and appeared on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album.

&quot;Figure 8&quot;, the final album Smith completed, was released on April 18, 2000. It featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England, with an obvious Beatles influence in the songwriting and production. The album garnered favorable reviews, and peaked at number 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 37 on the UK Album Charts. The album received praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a &quot;sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures&quot;. However, some reviewers felt that Smith&#x27;s trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the lyrics to &quot;the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary&quot;.

Album art and promotional pictures from the period showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, book-ended by television appearances on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. However, Smith&#x27;s condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the &quot;Figure 8&quot; tour.

=== 2001–2002: Addiction and scrapped recordings ===
Around the time he began recording his final album, Smith began to display signs of paranoia, often believing that a white van followed him wherever he went. He would have friends drop him off for recording sessions almost a mile away from the studio, and to reach the location, he would trudge through hundreds of yards of brush and cliffs. He started telling people that DreamWorks was out to get him: &quot;Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have wound up in the hands of certain people who work at a certain label. I&#x27;ve also been followed around for months at a time. I wouldn&#x27;t even want to necessarily say it&#x27;s the people from that label who are following me around, but it was probably them who broke into my house.&quot; During this period, Smith hardly ate, subsisting primarily on ice cream. He would go without sleeping for several days and then sleep for an entire day.

A follow-up to Smith&#x27;s 2000 album was originally planned to happen with Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the &quot;Roman Candle&quot; days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album when Brion stopped the sessions because of Smith&#x27;s struggle with substance use disorder. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work until that point. He later said &quot;There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn&#x27;t want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs.&quot;

When Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. Smith complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the &quot;Figure 8&quot; album. The talks proved fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told &quot;Spin&quot; that, during this time, Smith smoked over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, often talked about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.

Smith&#x27;s song &quot;Needle in the Hay&quot; was included in Wes Anderson&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; during a suicide attempt scene. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot; for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use The Mutato Muzika Orchestra&#x27;s version of the track instead. Anderson would later say that Smith &quot;was in a bad state&quot; at the time.

Smith&#x27;s live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the Pacific Northwest or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001, show at Portland&#x27;s Crystal Ballroom expressed concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long, his face was bearded and gaunt, and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of &quot;memory-loss and butterfingers&quot;. At another performance in San Francisco that month, the audience began shouting out lyrics when Smith could not remember them.

In the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University&#x27;s A&amp;O Ball with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. He was onstage for nearly an hour but failed to complete half of the songs. He claimed that his poor performance was due to his left hand having fallen asleep and told the audience it felt &quot;like having stuff on your hand and you can&#x27;t get it off&quot;. Smith&#x27;s performance was reviewed as &quot;undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician&quot; and an &quot;excruciating […] nightmare&quot;. A reporter for the online magazine &quot;Glorious Noise&quot; wrote, &quot;It would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year.&quot;

On November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a concert where The Flaming Lips and Beck were performing. The officers allegedly beat and arrested him and girlfriend Jennifer Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith&#x27;s back was injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith&#x27;s, stated concern over Smith&#x27;s appearance and actions, saying that he &quot;saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn&#x27;t want in a person. It&#x27;s not like when you think of Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner.&quot;

=== 2003: Reemergence and &quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot; ===

Smith had attempted to go to rehab several times, but found that he was unable to relate to the popular treatments for people with substance use disorder who used a twelve-step program basis for treatment. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t do the first step ... I couldn&#x27;t say what you were supposed to say and mean it.&quot; In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for substance use disorder. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center: &quot;What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you&#x27;re on a drip bag, but the only thing that&#x27;s in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I&#x27;m not psychotic.&quot;

Two sold-out solo acoustic concerts at Hollywood&#x27;s Henry Fonda Theater, on January 31 and February 1, 2003, saw Smith attempting to reestablish his credibility as a live performer. Before the show, Smith scrawled &quot;Kali – the Destroyer&quot; (the Hindu goddess associated with time and change) in large block letters with permanent ink on his left arm, which was visible to the crowd during the performance. On several songs, he was backed by a stripped-down drum kit played by Robin Peringer (of the band 764-HERO), and members of opening band Rilo Kiley contributed backing vocals to one song. Near the end of the first show, the musician responded for several minutes after a heckler yelled &quot;Get a backbone&quot;. Smith played two more Los Angeles concerts that year: The Derby in May 2003, and the &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; Music Awards in June 2003.

After his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith&#x27;s troubles and apparent recovery: &quot;I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth ... he went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making &quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot; and I was shocked that he was actually making music.&quot;

With things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with noise music and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba&#x27;s iMac with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar. Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording &quot;The California Frown&quot; (a play on the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;California Sound&quot;). He said &quot;They&#x27;re kind of more noisy with the pitch all distorted. Some are more acoustic, but there aren&#x27;t too many like that. Lately I&#x27;ve just been making up a lot of noise.&quot;

He was also in the process of recording songs for the &quot;Thumbsucker&quot; soundtrack, including Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Thirteen&quot; and Cat Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Trouble&quot;. In August 2003, Suicide Squeeze Records put out a limited-edition vinyl single for &quot;Pretty (Ugly Before)&quot;, a song that Smith had been playing since the &quot;Figure 8&quot; tour. Smith&#x27;s final show was at Redfest at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City on September 19, 2003. The final song he played live was &quot;Long, Long, Long&quot; by the Beatles.

=== 2004–present: Posthumous releases ===

&quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot;, almost four years in production, was released on October 19, 2004, by ANTI- Records (a part of Epitaph Records). With Smith&#x27;s family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in Rob Schnapf and Smith&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through the recordings and mix the album. Although Smith had voiced his desire for it to be a double album or a regular album with a bonus disc, it was not clear whether it would have been possible for him to release it that way had he completed it. As completed by Schnapf and Bolme, it was released as a 15-track single album. Many songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as &quot;True Love&quot;, &quot;Everything&#x27;s OK&quot;, &quot;Stickman&quot;, and &quot;Suicide Machine&quot; (a reworking of the &quot;Figure 8&quot;-era unreleased instrumental &quot;Tiny Time Machine&quot;). There has been unconfirmed speculation that Smith&#x27;s family made the decision not to include some songs on the record due to their lyrical content, although songs such as &quot;King&#x27;s Crossing&quot; that deal with darker subjects did make the album.

&quot;Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing&quot;, a biography by Benjamin Nugent, was rushed to publication shortly after &quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot;, shortly after the first anniversary of his death. Smith&#x27;s family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes, and Janet Weiss, all declined to be interviewed. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and Pete Krebs. The book received mixed reviews, with &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; remarking that while &quot;Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith&#x27;s life, he can offer little meaningful insight&quot;.

In 2005, a tribute album, &quot;A Tribute to Elliott Smith&quot;, was released. It featured various bands performing tributes to Smith. On May 8, 2007, a posthumous compilation album &quot;New Moon,&quot; was released by Kill Rock Stars. It contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label, songs that were not included on albums, as well as a few early versions and previously released B-sides. In the United States, the album debuted at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic&#x27;s 15th best-reviewed album of 2007. A portion of the proceeds from album sales were to go to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.

On October 25, 2007, a book titled &quot;Elliott Smith&quot; was released by Autumn de Wilde, which consists of photographs, handwritten lyrics, and &quot;revealing talks with Smith&#x27;s inner circle&quot;. De Wilde was responsible for the &quot;Figure 8&quot; sleeve art, making a landmark and de facto Smith memorial of the Solutions Audio mural. A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at Largo in Los Angeles was included in the release.

Following Smith&#x27;s death, his estate licensed his songs for use in film and television projects such as &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot;, &quot;Georgia Rule&quot;, and &quot;Paranoid Park&quot;. In a March 2009 interview, Larry Crane said that Smith&#x27;s estate was defunct and all rights previously held by Smith are now in the control of his parents. Crane went on to say that his parents own the rights to Smith&#x27;s high school recordings, some of the Heatmiser material, all solo songs recorded until his 1998 record deal with DreamWorks Records, and &quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot;. DreamWorks Records was acquired by Universal Music Group in 2003, and Interscope Records currently &quot;owns all studio and live recording from Jan 1998 to his passing, except for the songs on &quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot;.&quot;

In December 2009, Kill Rock Stars announced that it had obtained the rights to re-release &quot;Roman Candle&quot; and &quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot;, originally released by Cavity Search and ANTI-, respectively. &quot;Roman Candle&quot; would be remastered by Larry Crane. Along with the press release, Kill Rock Stars posted a previously unreleased track of Smith&#x27;s, titled &quot;Cecilia/Amanda&quot;, as a free download. &quot;Roman Candle&quot; and &quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot; were re-released on April 6, 2010, in the US.

A greatest hits compilation titled &quot;An Introduction to... Elliott Smith&quot; was released in November 2010 by Domino Records (UK) and Kill Rock Stars (US).

In August 2013, there was a memorial concert in Portland, Oregon, and three other cities. Attending the Portland show were several musicians Smith had performed with, friends, and an appearance by film director Gus Van Sant.

In 2014, the director Paul Thomas Anderson posted a video of the pilot episode for a show called &quot;The Jon Brion Show&quot;, featuring an acoustic set by Smith including accompaniment by Brion and pianist Brad Mehldau.

On July 17, 2015, a documentary about Smith&#x27;s life titled &quot;Heaven Adores You&quot; saw a limited theatrical release. The documentary enlisted a number of close friends and family members, as well as hours of audio interviews throughout Smith&#x27;s short career. The film was directed by Nickolas Rossi and released through Eagle Rock Entertainment. &quot;Heaven Adores You&quot; received positive reviews from Consequence of Sound, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

On August 6, 2019 (what would have been Smith&#x27;s 50th birthday), UMe released digital deluxe editions of the two albums &quot;XO&quot; and &quot;Figure 8.&quot; The new edition of &quot;XO&quot; has nine added tracks, including Smith&#x27;s Oscar-nominated &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; song &quot;Miss Misery.&quot; Seven tracks have been added to &quot;Figure 8&quot;. The digital deluxe edition includes &quot;Figure 8&quot;—Smith&#x27;s cover of the &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; song—which was originally released only on the Japanese edition of the album. The final track on the new &quot;Figure 8&quot; edition is Smith&#x27;s cover of the Beatles’ &quot;Because&quot;, originally featured on the 1999 &quot;American Beauty&quot; soundtrack. In May 2021, Smith&#x27;s life and work were the subject of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Great Lives&quot;.

== Death ==
Smith died on October 21, 2003, at the age of 34 from two stab wounds to the chest. At the time of the stabbing, he was at his Lemoyne Street home in Echo Park, California, where he lived with his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. According to Chiba, the two were arguing, and she locked herself in the bathroom to take a shower. Chiba heard him scream and upon opening the door saw Smith standing with a knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called 9-1-1 at 12:18 pm. Smith died in the hospital, with the time of death listed as 1:36 p.m. A possible suicide note, written on a sticky note, read: &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry—love, Elliott. God forgive me.&quot; The coroner misspelled Smith&#x27;s first name in the autopsy report, omitting the second &#x27;t&#x27;. While Smith&#x27;s death was reported as a suicide, the official autopsy report released in December 2003 left open the question of homicide.

Smith&#x27;s remains were cremated, and his ashes were divided between his mother, father, and half-sister Ashley. A small memorial service for family and friends was held at his father&#x27;s home in Portland, although Smith&#x27;s &quot;ashes weren&#x27;t on hand because the coroner wouldn&#x27;t release them.&quot; The status or location of Smith&#x27;s ashes has not been made public.

According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, record producer Larry Crane reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote, &quot;I hadn&#x27;t talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [last week] and asked if I&#x27;d like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [Smith&#x27;s album]. I said &#x27;yes, of course&#x27;, and chatted with Elliott for the first time in ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t understand, he was so healthy. The coroner reported that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol were found in Smith&#x27;s system at the time of his death but did find prescribed levels of antidepressant, anxiolytic, and ADHD medications, including clonazepam, mirtazapine, atomoxetine, and amphetamine. There were no hesitation wounds. Due to the inconclusive autopsy ruling, the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s investigation remains open. 

Smith received a letter from his step-father, Charlie Welch, on the day he died, but did not get the chance to read it. In the letter, Welch denies having urges to sexually abuse anyone after Smith&#x27;s allegations of repeated childhood sexual abuse from him but apologised for general mistreatment of him and his &quot;deficiencies as a father.&quot;

=== Reaction ===
Shortly after Smith&#x27;s death, a fan memorial was initiated outside Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site at which the cover of the &quot;Figure 8&quot; album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, and flowers, photos, candles, and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith&#x27;s songs were left. Since then, the wall has been a regular target for graffiti but is regularly restored by fans.

Memorial concerts were held in several cities in the United States and the United Kingdom. A petition was soon put forth with intent to make part of the Silver Lake area a memorial park in Smith&#x27;s honor. It received over 10,000 signatures, but no plans to establish the park have been announced. A memorial plaque located inside Smith&#x27;s former high school, Lincoln High, was hung in July 2006. The plaque reads: &quot;I&#x27;m never going to know you now, but I&#x27;m going to love you anyhow&quot; referencing Smith&#x27;s song &quot;Waltz No. 2 (XO)&quot;.
Since Smith&#x27;s death, many musical acts have paid him tribute. Songs in tribute to, or about, Smith have been released by Pearl Jam (&quot;Can&#x27;t Keep&quot; on the &quot;Live at Benaroya Hall&quot; concert album); Sparta (&quot;Bombs and Us&quot;); Third Eye Blind (&quot;There&#x27;s No Hurry to Eternity&quot;, originally titled &quot;Elliott Smith&quot;, on the &quot;Live from Nowhere Near You, Volume Two: Pacific Northwest&quot; compilation); 9 Horses (“listening to the Elliott Smith discography in reverse order”, on the album &quot;Perfectest Herald&quot;); Ben Folds (&quot;Late&quot; on &quot;Songs for Silverman&quot;); Brad Mehldau (&quot;Sky Turning Grey (for Elliott Smith)&quot; on &quot;Highway Rider&quot;); Rilo Kiley (&quot;It Just Is&quot;, and &quot;Ripchord&quot; from the album &quot;More Adventurous&quot;); Lil B&#x27;s &#x27;The Worlds Ending&#x27;; Rhett Miller (&quot;The Believer&quot; on &quot;The Believer&quot;); Earlimart (&quot;Heaven Adores You&quot; on &quot;Treble and Tremble&quot;); Joan As Police Woman (&quot;We Don&#x27;t Own It&quot; on &quot;Real Life&quot;); Phoebe Bridgers (&quot;Punisher&quot; on &quot;Punisher&quot;); and Pete Yorn (&quot;Bandstand in the Sky&quot; on &quot;Nightcrawler&quot;, a song jointly dedicated to Jeff Buckley). Several tribute albums have been released since his death, including Christopher O&#x27;Riley&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Home to Oblivion: An Elliott Smith Tribute&quot;, with 18 instrumental covers, The Portland Cello Project&#x27;s 2014 &quot;to e.s.&quot;, covering six of his songs, Seth Avett and Jessica Lea Mayfield&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Seth Avett and Jessica Lea Mayfield Sing Elliott Smith,&quot; with 12 covers incorporating Smith&#x27;s musical style and their own, and &quot;To Elliott, from Portland&quot; containing covers by a number of Portland bands. Singer Madonna covered his 1997 song &quot;Between the Bars&quot; in 2017.

On July 30, 2004, Chiba filed a lawsuit against the Smith family for 15% of his earnings (over $1 million), claiming that she and Smith lived as &quot;husband and wife&quot;, that Smith had pledged to take care of her financially for the rest of her life, and that she worked as his manager and agent from around 2000 until his death. A state labor commissioner ruled her claim as manager to be invalid, as she had worked as an &quot;unlicensed talent agent&quot; under California&#x27;s Talent Agencies Act. The case made it to the California appellate court in October 2007, but the decision was affirmed 2–1.

In an October 2013 &quot;Spin&quot; magazine article—a reflection at the 10-year anniversary of Smith&#x27;s death—drummer McPherson stated that Smith was &quot;a sick man without his medicine&quot; during the last 31 days of his life, when he was not only sober, but had also given up red meat and sugar. In the same article, Chiba recalls thinking, &quot;Okay, you&#x27;re asking a lot of yourself. You&#x27;re giving up a lot at once.&quot; Chiba further explained that &quot;anyone who understands drug abuse knows that you use drugs to hide from your past or sedate yourself from strong, overwhelming feelings. So when you&#x27;re newly clean and coming off the medications that have been masking all those feelings, that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re the most vulnerable.&quot; Writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, Liam Gowing also encountered a local musician who claimed Smith had said to him: &quot;The people who try to intervene, they&#x27;re good people who genuinely care about you. But they don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re going through. Do what you need to do.&quot; According to the musician, Smith had adamantly dissuaded him from suicide.

== Musical style and influences ==
Smith respected and was inspired by many artists and styles, including the Beatles, Big Star, the Clash, the Who, Led Zeppelin, the Kinks, Pink Floyd, Rush, Bauhaus, Elvis Costello, Oasis, Television, Motown and flamenco records, AC/DC, Hank Williams, and Scorpions, Smith claimed to listen exclusively to selected albums (such as &quot;The Marble Index&quot; by Nico) for months. Sean Croghan, a former roommate of Smith&#x27;s, said that Smith &quot;listened almost exclusively to slow jams&quot; in his senior year at college. Smith also took inspiration from novels, religion, and philosophy. He liked classic literature, especially Samuel Beckett, T.S. Eliot, and Russian novelists such as Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

Smith mentioned his admiration for Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early influence. He once commented: &quot;My father taught me how to play &#x27;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s All Right&#x27;. I love Dylan&#x27;s words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words.&quot; Smith covered Dylan&#x27;s &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot; several times in concert. Smith has also been compared to folk singer Nick Drake, due to his fingerpicking style and vocals. Darryl Cater of AllMusic called references to &quot;the definitive folk loner&quot; Drake &quot;inevitable&quot;, and Smith&#x27;s lyrics have been compared to those in Drake&#x27;s minimalist and haunting final album.

Smith was a dedicated fan of the Beatles (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about &quot;four years old&quot; and also claimed that hearing &quot;The White Album&quot; was his original inspiration to become a musician. In 1998, Smith contributed a cover of the Beatles song &quot;Because&quot; to the closing credits and soundtrack of the film &quot;American Beauty&quot;. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded many others, (&quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Back&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m So Tired&quot;) and played many songs by both the band and the members&#x27; solo projects at live concerts.

Smith said that his chord progressions were his favorite part of songs and that he preferred to write broader, more impressionistic music closer to pop rather than folk music. Smith compared his songs to stories or dreams, not purely confessional pieces that people could relate to. When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said he felt it was merely a product of his writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. Larry Crane, Smith&#x27;s posthumous archivist, has said that he was surprised at the amount of &quot;recycling of musical ideas&quot; he encountered while cataloging Smith&#x27;s private tapes: &quot;I found songs recorded in high school reworked 15 years on. Lyrics became more important to him as he became older, and more time was spent working on them.&quot;

Smith&#x27;s early albums were acoustic solo albums where he recorded all of the instruments by himself (with less than ideal equipment), which music journalists have said created a &quot;homemade atmosphere&quot; that augmented his &quot;existential lyrics&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Since his death, Smith has been regarded as one of the most influential artists in indie music. Many artists have mentioned Smith as their influence, such as Frank Ocean, Beck, Julien Baker, Adrianne Lenker, CIAO MALZ, Alex G, Beabadoobee, and Haim&#x27;s lead vocalist Danielle Haim.

<text>In the Eleusinian Mysteries, the bakchoi were the branches of initiates that carried out the procession along the Sacred Way, the twenty-one kilometer hike from Athens to Eleusis. The term is sometimes distinguished from &quot;mystai&quot; (initiate), specifically the Eleusinian initiate, only for the purpose of emphasis since the two words are considered synonymous. The bacchoi was considered a transformed state after performing initiations and this was described by Euripides in the case of his Cretans, who proclaimed they were made holy – &quot;mystai&quot; and &quot;bacchoi&quot; – after cleansing themselves through initiation.

Bacchoi is sometimes attached to other terms. For instance, there is &quot;Iacchoi-Bacchoi&quot;, where &quot;Iacchos&quot; served as a synonym for Bacchus.

<doc id="80656" wikidata="Q2062042" url="?curid=80656" title="Unity Church">
<text>Unity is a spiritual organization founded by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore in 1889. It grew out of Transcendentalism and became part of the New Thought movement. Unity may be best known for its &quot;Daily Word&quot; devotional publication begun in 1924. Originally based in Christianity with emphasis on the Bible, Unity has said it is a &quot;Christian movement that emphasizes affirmative prayer and education as a path to spirituality,&quot; and says about itself, &quot;We honor all spiritual practices and the diversity of paths leading to enlightenment.&quot;

==Overview==

Unity describes itself as a global, inclusive, spiritual community, offering practical tools and uplifting resources to help people of all faiths apply positive spiritual principles in their daily lives. Unity welcomes all people regardless of race, color, gender, age, creed, religion, national origin, ethnicity, physical disability, or sexual orientation.

Unity describes itself as having no particular creed, set dogma, or required ritual. It maintains that there is good in every approach to God and holds that one should focus on the potential good in allthat the essence of every human is divine regardless of current behavior.

Unity emphasizes healing by spiritual means, but it does not reject or resist medical treatments.

Unity is the largest group connected with the New Thought movement, and the only one to maintain a significant Christian identity.

==History==
The &quot;Unity School of Christianity&quot; was founded in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1889 by Charles Fillmore (1854–1948) and Myrtle Fillmore (1845–1931) after Mrs. Fillmore had been cured of her tuberculosis, she believed, by spiritual healing. To learn more about spiritual principles, the Fillmores studied the teachings of world religions and the links between science and religion. They were influenced by Dr. E. B. Weeks, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Emma Curtis Hopkins and Mary Baker Eddy (the founder of Christian Science).

Although the Unity School of Christianity was not incorporated until 1914, the Fillmores began publishing their first magazine, &quot;Modern Thought&quot;, in April 1889. Later magazines included &quot;Wee Wisdom&quot; (for children) and &quot;Daily Word&quot;. In 1891, the Fillmores named the movement Unity and began publishing in 1903 with &quot;Lessons in Truth&quot; by H. Emilie Cady. In 1906, Mr. and Mrs. Fillmore accepted ordination and ordained seven other ministers.

After World War I, Unity Village, which became a 1,200-acre incorporated town, was developed 15 miles southeast of Kansas City, beginning with the purchase of a farm. Originally a weekend getaway for the Fillmores&#x27; downtown employees, Unity Village is now the headquarters for the prayer and publishing work of the Unity spiritual movement.

After Charles Fillmore&#x27;s death, the Fillmores’ sons and grandchildren initially led the movement. Great-granddaughter Connie Fillmore stepped down as president in 2001. Governance was then converted to a CEO and board composed of Unity ministers and outside business people.

The mission of Unity World Headquarters is to help and serve through prayer, publishing, and community. Unity World Headquarters offers resources to people of all faiths, including magazines, booklets, videos, books, meditations, retreats, and events.

The Unity Prayer Ministry, also known as Silent Unity, has continuously prayed with people of all faiths worldwide for more than a century. Prayer associates respond to over 1 million prayer requests yearly by letter, phone, email, and social media.

==Organization==
Individual Unity churches are autonomous, each governed by its own board and minister. Minister training, ministerial placement, and educational resources are supported by Unity Worldwide Ministries, a separate nonprofit organization that leases office space at Unity Village from Unity World Headquarters.

In 2010, there were 594 Unity churches in the United States. Unity Worldwide Ministries counts 650 churches and 1,700 licensed and ordained leaders worldwide.

==Basic teachings==
The five basic ideas of Unity teachings reflect the universal spiritual principles taught in most of the world&#x27;s religions.
#God is everywhere and always present in every circumstance. This divine energy underlies and animates all of existence.
#Human beings are innately good because they are connected to and an expression of Spirit. 
#Our thoughts have creative power to influence events and determine our experiences.
#Prayer and meditation connect and align us to our own spiritual nature and to God.
#It is not enough to understand spiritual teachings. We must apply our learning in all areas of life, incorporating them into our thoughts, words, and actions.

Unity teaches that each person is a unique expression of God and is sacred and worthy. It emphasizes the creative power of thought and encourages choosing life-affirming thoughts, words, and actions in order to experience a more fulfilling and abundant life.

===God===

Unity views God as spiritual energy that is present everywhere and is available to all people. According to Unity co-founder Charles Fillmore: “God is not a person who has set creation in motion and gone away and left it to run down like a clock. God is Spirit, infinite Mind, the immanent force and intelligence everywhere manifest in nature. God is the silent voice that speaks into visibility all the life there is.”

===Jesus===

Unity teaches the divinity of Jesus and of all human beings. They consider him an “elder brother” or “wayshower” whose life demonstrated what is possible when we live from our innate spiritual nature or divine consciousness.

===Nature of humanity===

Unity teaches that all people are individual, eternal expressions of God, and their essential nature is divine and therefore inherently good. Followers believe their purpose in life is to express their divine potential as demonstrated by Jesus, and that the more they awaken to their divine nature, the more they can do this.

===Bible===

Unity founders Charles and Myrtle Fillmore interpreted the Bible as a metaphysical representation of each soul’s evolutionary journey toward spiritual awakening. Unity considers the Bible its primary spiritual resource, a complex collection of writings compiled over many centuries and a reflection of the comprehension and inspiration of the writers and their times.

===Affirmative prayer===

Affirmative prayer is understood in Unity as the highest form of creative thought. It includes the release of negative thoughts and holding in mind statements of spiritual truth. Unity teaches the use of meditation and prayer as a way to experience the presence of God, heighten the awareness of truth, and thereby transform a person&#x27;s life. Prayer is believed valuable not because it alters the circumstances and conditions of a person&#x27;s life but because it alters the person.

==Relationship to Christianity==

Unlike other New Thought groups, Unity emphasizes its agreements, not differences, with traditional Christians and stresses its concurrence with the teachings of Jesus, the influence of the Holy Spirit, and the Bible. According to Unity co-founder Charles Fillmore:
It has been generally accepted that Jesus&#x27; great works were miracles and that the power to do miracles was delegated to His immediate followers only. In recent years many of Jesus&#x27; followers have inquired into His healing methods, and they have found that healing is based on universal mental and spiritual laws which anyone can utilize who will comply with the conditions involved in these laws.
Unity considers itself a non-sectarian educational institution, although Unity ministers are ordained following their prescribed courses and training.

==Notable members==

There are well-known people affiliated with Unity such as Della Reese, Betty White, Eleanor Powell, Lucie Arnaz, David Friedman, Wally Amos, actress Michael Learned, Licensed Unity Teacher Ruth Warrick, Barbara Billingsley, Theodore Schneider, Erykah Badu, Matt Hoverman, author Victoria Moran, Patricia Neal, Johnnie Colemon, and Maya Angelou.

<text>Terrence Frederick Malick (; born November 30, 1943) is an American filmmaker. Malick began his career as part of the New Hollywood generation of filmmakers and received awards at the Cannes Film Festival, Berlin International Film Festival, and Venice International Film Festival, and nominations for three Academy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, a Cesar Award, and a Directors Guild of America Award.

Malick made his feature film debut with the crime drama &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973), followed by the romantic period drama &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; (1978), which earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director. He then directed the World War II epic &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1998), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director, the historical romantic drama &quot;The New World&quot; (2005), and the experimental coming-of-age drama &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; (2011), for which he was again nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and won the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Palme d&#x27;Or.

Malick&#x27;s directorial output became more consistent and experimental with &quot;To the Wonder&quot; (2013), &quot;Knight of Cups&quot; (2015), &quot;Song to Song&quot; (2017), and &quot;A Hidden Life&quot; (2019). During this time he also directed the documentary film &quot;Voyage of Time&quot; (2016) about the birth and death of the universe. Malick has frequently collaborated with Emmanuel Lubezki, who served as the director of photography on seven of his films. 

Malick&#x27;s films explore themes such as transcendence and conflicts between reason and instinct as well as nature versus nurture. They typically have broad philosophical and spiritual overtones and employ meditative voice-overs by their characters. Malick&#x27;s style has polarized scholars and audiences; many praise his films for their lavish cinematography and aesthetics, but others fault them for lacking plot and character development. His work has nonetheless ranked highly in retrospective decade-end and all-time polls.

==Early life and education==

Malick was born in Ottawa, Illinois. He is the son of Irene (née Thompson; 1912–2011) and Emil A. Malick (1917–2013), a geologist. His paternal grandparents were of Lebanese and Assyrian descent from Urmia, while his mother was an Irish Catholic. Malick attended St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal School in Austin, Texas, while his family lived in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. 

Malick had two younger brothers, Chris and Larry. Larry Malick was a guitarist who went to study in Spain with Andrés Segovia in the late 1960s. In 1968, Larry intentionally broke his own hands due to pressure over his musical studies. Their father Emil went to Spain to help Larry, but his son died shortly after, possibly by suicide. The early death of Malick&#x27;s younger brother has been explored and referenced in his films &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; (2011) and &quot;Knight of Cups&quot; (2015).

Malick graduated from Harvard College in 1965 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He received a Rhodes Scholarship, which he used to study philosophy at Oxford University&#x27;s Magdalen College. After a disagreement with his advisor, Gilbert Ryle, over Malick&#x27;s thesis on the concept of world in Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein, Malick left Oxford without a degree. In 1969, Northwestern University Press published Malick&#x27;s translation of Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Vom Wesen des Grundes&quot; as &quot;The Essence of Reasons&quot;.

After returning to the United States, Malick taught philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while freelancing as a journalist. He wrote articles for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and &quot;Life&quot;.

==Film career==
=== 1969–1978: Film debut and acclaim ===

Malick started his film career after earning an MFA from the brand-new AFI Conservatory in 1969, directing the short film &quot;Lanton Mills&quot;. At the AFI, he established contacts with people such as actor Jack Nicholson, longtime collaborator Jack Fisk, and agent Mike Medavoy, who procured for Malick freelance work revising scripts. He wrote early uncredited drafts of &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; (1971) and &quot;Drive, He Said&quot; (1971), and is credited with the screenplay for &quot;Pocket Money&quot; (1972). Malick also co-wrote &quot;The Gravy Train&quot; (1974) under the pseudonym David Whitney.

Malick&#x27;s first feature-length work as a director was &quot;Badlands&quot;, an independent film starring Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek as a young couple on a crime spree in the 1950s Midwest. It was influenced by the crimes of convicted teenage spree killer Charles Starkweather. Malick raised half the budget by approaching people outside of the industry, including doctors and dentists, and by contributing $25,000 from his personal savings. The rest was raised by executive producer Edward R. Pressman. After a troubled production that included many crew members leaving halfway through, &quot;Badlands&quot; drew raves upon its premiere at the New York Film Festival. As a result, Warner Bros. bought distribution rights for three times its budget.
Malick&#x27;s second film was the Paramount-produced &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;, about a love triangle that develops in the farm country of the Texas Panhandle in the early 20th century. Production began in the fall of 1976 in Alberta, Canada. The film was mostly shot during the golden hour, with primarily natural light. Much like Malick&#x27;s first feature, &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; had a lengthy and troubled production, with several members of the production crew quitting before shooting was finished, mainly due to disagreements with Malick&#x27;s idiosyncratic directorial style. The film likewise had a troubled post-production phase. Billy Weber and Malick spent two years editing it, during which they experimented with unconventional editing and voice-over techniques once they realized the picture they had set out to make would not fully work.

&quot;Days of Heaven&quot; was finally released in 1978 to mostly positive responses from critics. Its cinematography was widely praised, although some found its story lackluster. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Harold C. Schonberg wrote that it &quot;is full of elegant and striking photography; and it is an intolerably artsy, artificial film.&quot; It won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and the prize for Best Director at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival. Its reputation has since improved, having been voted one of the 50 greatest American films ever made in a 2015 critics&#x27; poll published by the BBC.

Following the release of &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;, Malick began developing a project for Paramount, titled &quot;Q&quot;, that explored the origins of life on earth. During pre-production, he suddenly moved to Paris and disappeared from public view for years. During this time, he wrote a number of screenplays, including &quot;The English Speaker&quot;, about Josef Breuer&#x27;s analysis of Anna O.; adaptations of Walker Percy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; and Larry McMurtry&#x27;s &quot;The Desert Rose&quot;; a script about Jerry Lee Lewis; and a stage adaptation of the Japanese film &quot;Sansho the Bailiff&quot; that was to be directed by Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda, in addition to continuing work on the &quot;Q&quot; script. Although &quot;Q&quot; has never been made, Malick&#x27;s work on the project provided material for his film &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; and eventually became the basis for &quot;Voyage of Time&quot;. Jack Fisk, a longtime production designer on Malick&#x27;s films, has said Malick was shooting film during this time as well.

=== 1997–2011: Return to cinema ===
Malick returned to directing in 1997 with &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, released two decades after his previous film. A loose adaptation of James Jones&#x27;s World War II novel of the same name, it features a large ensemble cast, including Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Ben Chaplin, Elias Koteas, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney, and John Travolta. Filming took place predominantly in the Daintree Rainforest in Queensland, Australia and in the Solomon Islands.

The film received critical acclaim, was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and won the Golden Bear at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival. &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; has since been ranked among the best films of the 1990s in &quot;Complex&quot;, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, &quot;Slant&quot;, &quot;Paste&quot;, and &quot;Film Comment&quot;.

After learning of Malick&#x27;s work on an article about Che Guevara during the 1960s, Steven Soderbergh offered Malick the chance to write and direct a film about Guevara he had been developing with Benicio del Toro. Malick accepted and produced a screenplay focused on Guevara&#x27;s failed revolution in Bolivia. After a year and a half, the financing had not come together entirely, and Malick was given the opportunity to direct &quot;The New World&quot;, a script he had begun developing in the 1970s. He left the Guevara project in March 2004, and Soderbergh took over as director, leading to the film &quot;Che&quot; (2008). &quot;The New World&quot;, based on the story of John Smith and Pocahontas in the Virginia Colony, was released in 2005. Over one million feet of film were shot, and three different cuts of varying length were released.

While the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, critical reception was divided throughout its theatrical run; many praised its visuals and acting while finding its narrative unfocused. Five critics later named &quot;The New World&quot; one of the best films of its decade, and it ranked 39th in a 2016 BBC poll of the greatest films since 2000.
Malick&#x27;s fifth feature, &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, was filmed in Smithville, Texas, and elsewhere during 2008. Starring Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, and Sean Penn, it is a family drama spanning multiple time periods; it focuses on an individual&#x27;s struggle to reconcile love, mercy and beauty with the existence of illness, suffering and death. It premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d&#x27;Or. It later won the FIPRESCI Award for the Best Film of the Year. At the 84th Academy Awards, it was nominated for three awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director for Malick, and Best Cinematography for Emmanuel Lubezki. A limited theatrical release in the United States began on May 27, 2011.

Malick scholars Christopher B. Barnett and Clark J. Elliston wrote that it became &quot;arguably [Malick&#x27;s] most acclaimed work&quot;. It was voted the 79th greatest American film of all time in a 2015 BBC Culture poll of 62 international film critics. The work was also ranked the seventh-greatest film since 2000 in a worldwide critics&#x27; poll by BBC.

=== 2012–2017: Career fluctuations === 
Malick&#x27;s sixth feature, &quot;To the Wonder&quot;, was shot predominantly in Bartlesville, Oklahoma; a few scenes were filmed in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, and at the Tulsa Port of Catoosa. The film stars Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams, Olga Kurylenko, and Javier Bardem. &quot;To the Wonder&quot; had its world premiere at the 69th Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2012, and opened theatrically in the U.S. on April 12, 2013. Critical response to the film was markedly divided, and it has been called &quot;arguably [Malick&#x27;s] most derided&quot;.

On November 1, 2011, Filmnation Entertainment announced international sales for Malick&#x27;s next two projects: &quot;Lawless&quot; (later released as &quot;Song to Song&quot;) and &quot;Knight of Cups&quot;. Both films have large ensemble casts, with many actors appearing in both. The films were shot back-to-back in 2012, &quot;Song to Song&quot; primarily in Austin, Texas, and &quot;Knight of Cups&quot; in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. During the weekend of September 16, 2011, Malick and a small crew were seen filming Christian Bale and Haley Bennett at the Austin City Limits Music Festival as part of preliminary shooting for &quot;Song to Song&quot;. Malick was also seen directing Ryan Gosling and Rooney Mara at the Fun Fun Fun Fest on November 4, 2011. &quot;Knight of Cups&quot; had its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2015, and was met with mixed reactions. It was released in the U.S. on March 4, 2016, by Broad Green Pictures.

&quot;Song to Song&quot; had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2017, before being released theatrically in the U.S. on March 17 by Broad Green Pictures, and was met with mixed reactions. Concurrent with these two features, Malick continued work on an Imax documentary, &quot;Voyage of Time&quot;, that examines the birth and death of the known universe. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it &quot;a celebration of the Earth, displaying the whole of time, from the birth of the universe to its final collapse.&quot; The film is the culmination of a project Malick had been working on for over 40 years, and has been described by Malick as &quot;one of my greatest dreams&quot;. It features footage Malick and collaborators shot over the years, and expands on the footage that special effects luminaries Douglas Trumbull (&quot;2001&quot;) and Dan Glass (&quot;The Matrix&quot;) created for &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;. It was released in two versions: a 40-minute IMAX version (&quot;Voyage of Time: The IMAX Experience&quot;) with narration by Brad Pitt, and a 90-minute feature-length version (&quot;Voyage of Time: Life&#x27;s Journey&quot;) with narration by Cate Blanchett. The feature-length version had its world premiere on September 7, 2016, at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival. The IMAX version was released on October 7, 2016, by IMAX Corporation and Broad Green Pictures.

=== 2019–present ===
Malick&#x27;s next film, &quot;A Hidden Life&quot;, depicts the life of Austria&#x27;s Franz Jägerstätter, a conscientious objector during World War II who was put to death at age 36 for undermining military actions and was later declared a martyr and beatified by the Catholic Church. August Diehl stars as Jägerstätter, with Valerie Pachner as his wife, Franziska. The film was shot in Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam, Germany, in the summer of 2016, and in parts of northern Italy, such as Brixen, South Tyrol, and the small mountain village of Sappada. It was released in 2019. Malick has said that, compared to his more recent films, with &quot;A Hidden Life&quot; he had &quot;repented and gone back to working with a much tighter script&quot;.

In August and/or September 2016, Malick directed a commercial, &quot;Notes of a Woman&quot;, released on February 26, 2017, for Mon Guerlain perfume. Starring Angelina Jolie, it was shot at her and Brad Pitt&#x27;s Château Miraval estate in Correns and photographed by Austrian cinematographer Christian Berger.

==== Upcoming projects ====
On June 7, 2019, Malick reportedly started shooting his next film, code-named &quot;The Last Planet&quot;, near Rome, Italy. The film will tell the story of Jesus&#x27;s life through a series of parables. On September 8, the cast was revealed to include Géza Röhrig as Jesus, Matthias Schoenaerts as Saint Peter, and Mark Rylance as four versions of Satan. On November 20, 2020, it was announced that the film&#x27;s name would be &quot;The Way of the Wind.&quot;

==Themes and style==
Critics have noted the philosophical themes of Malick&#x27;s films. According to film scholar Lloyd Michaels, Malick&#x27;s main themes include &quot;the isolated individual&#x27;s desire for transcendence amidst established social institutions, the grandeur and untouched beauty of nature, the competing claims of instinct and reason, and the lure of the open road&quot;. He named &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; as one in a group of acclaimed films from the 1970s that were intended to revolutionize the American film epic. Like &quot;The Godfather&quot; films (1972, 1974), &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), and &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978), Michaels argued that the movie delves into &quot;certain national myths&quot; as an idiosyncratic type of Western, &quot;particularly the migration westward, the dream of personal success, and the clash of agrarian and industrial economies&quot;. Roger Ebert considered Malick&#x27;s body of work to have a unifying common theme: &quot;Human lives diminish beneath the overarching majesty of the world.&quot; In Ebert&#x27;s opinion, Malick was among the few remaining directors who yearned &quot;to make no less than a masterpiece&quot;. While reviewing &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic A. O. Scott compared Malick to innovative &quot;homegrown romantics&quot; such as the writers Walt Whitman, Hart Crane, James Agee, and Herman Melville, in the sense that their &quot;definitive writings&quot; also &quot;did not sit comfortably or find universal favor in their own time&quot; but nonetheless &quot;leaned perpetually into the future, pushing their readers forward toward a new horizon of understanding&quot;.

Malick&#x27;s body of work has inspired polarized opinions. According to Michaels, &quot;few American directors have inspired such adulation and rejection with each successive film&quot; as Malick. Michaels said that in all of American cinema, Malick is the filmmaker most frequently &quot;granted genius status after creating such a discontinuous and limited body of work&quot;. Malick makes use of broad philosophical and spiritual overtones, such as in the form of meditative voice-overs from individual characters. Some critics feel these elements made the films engaging and unique, while others find them pretentious and gratuitous, particularly in his post-hiatus work. Michaels believed the opinions &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; continues to elicit among scholars and film enthusiasts exemplify this: &quot;The debate continues to revolve around what to make of &#x27;its extremities of beauty&#x27;, whether the exquisite lighting, painterly compositions, dreamy dissolves, and fluid camera movements, combined with the epic grandeur and elegiac tone, sufficiently compensate for the thinness of the tale, the two-dimensionality of the characters, and the resulting emotional detachment of the audience.&quot; &quot;Reverse Shot&quot; journalist Chris Wisniewski regarded both &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; and &quot;The New World&quot; not as &quot;literary nor theatrical&quot; but &quot;principally cinematic&quot; in their aesthetic, intimating narrative, emotional, and conceptual themes through the use of &quot;image and sound&quot; instead of &quot;foregrounding dialogue, events or characters&quot;. He highlighted Malick&#x27;s use of &quot;rambling philosophical voiceovers; the placid images of nature, offering quiet contrast to the evil deeds of men; the stunning cinematography, often achieved with natural light; the striking use of music&quot;.

While the perception of Malick as a recluse is inaccurate, he is nevertheless famously protective of his private life. His contracts stipulate that his likeness may not be used for promotional purposes, and he routinely declines requests for interviews.

From 1970 to 1976, Malick was married to Jill Jakes. His companion in the late 1970s was director and screenwriter Michie Gleason. In 1985 in France, he married Michèle Marie Morette, whom he met in Paris in 1980; in 1996, Malick asked for a divorce, which was granted. Afterward he married Alexandra &quot;Ecky&quot; Wallace, his high-school sweetheart.

Malick&#x27;s semi-autobiographical film &quot;To the Wonder&quot; was inspired by his relationships with Morette and Wallace.

, Malick has lived in Austin, Texas.

<doc id="80664" wikidata="Q313639" url="?curid=80664" title="Michael Nyman">
<text>Michael Laurence Nyman, CBE (born 23 March 1944) is an English composer, pianist, librettist, musicologist, and filmmaker. He is known for numerous film scores (many written during his lengthy collaboration with the filmmaker Peter Greenaway), and his multi-platinum soundtrack album to Jane Campion&#x27;s &quot;The Piano&quot;. He has written a number of operas, including &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot;; &quot;Letters, Riddles and Writs&quot;; &quot;Noises, Sounds &amp; Sweet Airs&quot;; &quot;Facing Goya&quot;; &quot;Man and Boy: Dada&quot;; &quot;Love Counts&quot;; and &quot;Sparkie: Cage and Beyond&quot;. He has written six concerti, five string quartets, and many other chamber works, many for his Michael Nyman Band. He is also a performing pianist. Nyman prefers to write opera over other forms of music.

== Early life and education ==
Nyman was born in Stratford, London, to a family of secular Jewish furriers who immigrated from Poland.

Nyman was educated at the Sir George Monoux Grammar School, Walthamstow. He studied from 1961 until 1967 at King&#x27;s College London, and at the Royal Academy of Music until 1967 with Alan Bush and Thurston Dart, focusing on piano and seventeenth-century baroque music. He won the Howard Carr Memorial Prize for composition in July 1964. In 1965–66 Nyman secured a residency in Romania to study folk-song, supported by a British Council bursary.

== Career ==
=== Work as music critic, 1968–1976===
Nyman says he discovered his aesthetic by playing the aria &quot;Madamina, il catalogo è questo&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; on his piano in the style of Jerry Lee Lewis, which &quot;dictated the dynamic, articulation and texture of everything I&#x27;ve subsequently done.&quot; It subsequently became the base for his 1977 piece &quot;In Re Don Giovanni.&quot;

In 1969, Nyman provided the libretto of Harrison Birtwistle&#x27;s opera &quot;Down by the Greenwood Side&quot; and directed the short film &quot;Love Love Love&quot; (based on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;). He then settled into music criticism, where he is generally acknowledged to have been the first to apply the term &quot;minimalism&quot; to music, in a 1968 article in &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine about the English composer Cornelius Cardew. He wrote introductions for George Frideric Handel&#x27;s Concerti grossi, Op. 6, and interviewed George Brecht in 1976. His 1976 album &quot;Decay Music&quot; was produced by Brian Eno. In 1974 Nyman published an influential book called &quot;Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond&quot;, which explored the influence of John Cage on classical composers.

===Founding of Campiello Band and collaboration with Peter Greenaway, 1976–1990 ===
In the 1970s, Nyman was a member of the Portsmouth Sinfonia – the self-described World&#x27;s Worst Orchestra. He was the featured pianist on the orchestra&#x27;s recording of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; on the 1979 Martin Lewis-produced &quot;20 Classic Rock Classics&quot; album, on which the Sinfonia gave their unique interpretations of the pop and rock repertoire of the 1950s–1970s. 

In 1976, he formed the Campiello Band, which became the Michael Nyman Band, for a production of Carlo Goldoni&#x27;s &quot;Il Campiello&quot;. Originally made up of old instruments such as rebecs and shawms alongside more modern instruments like the saxophone to produce as loud a sound as possible without amplification, the band later switched to a fully amplified line-up of string quartet, three saxophones, trumpet, horn, bass trombone, bass guitar and piano. Many of Nyman&#x27;s works are written for his ensemble, with the lineup variously altered and augmented.

One of his earliest film scores was the 1976 British sex comedy &quot;Keep It Up Downstairs&quot;, followed by numerous films, many of them European art films, including eleven directed by Peter Greenaway. Nyman drew frequently on early music sources in his scores for Greenaway&#x27;s films: Henry Purcell in &quot;The Draughtsman&#x27;s Contract&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot; (1989) (which included Memorial and Miserere Paraphrase), Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber in &quot;A Zed &amp; Two Noughts&quot; (1985), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot; (1988), and John Dowland in &quot;Prospero&#x27;s Books&quot; (1991), largely at the request of the director. He wrote settings to various texts by Mozart for &quot;Letters, Riddles and Writs&quot;, part of &quot;Not Mozart&quot;. 

In 1987 Nyman composed the opera &quot;Noises, Sounds &amp; Sweet Airs&quot;, for soprano, alto, tenor and instrumental ensemble (based on Nyman&#x27;s score for the ballet &quot;La Princesse de Milan&quot;); the opera &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot; (1986), based on a case-study by Oliver Sacks; and five string quartets. He also recorded pop music with the Flying Lizards; a version of his &quot;Bird List&quot; from the soundtrack to Peter Greenaway&#x27;s &quot;The Falls&quot; (1980) appears on their album &quot;Fourth Wall&quot; as &quot;Hands 2 Take&quot;.

===1990s=== 
In 1990 he composed &quot;Ariel Songs&quot; for soprano and band; in 1993 MGV (Musique à Grande Vitesse) for band and orchestra; concertos for saxophone, piano (based on the score for &quot;The Piano&quot;), violin, harpsichord, trombone, and saxophone &amp; cello recorded by John Harle and Julian Lloyd Webber;

In 1991 Nyman composed &quot;The Michael Nyman Songbook&quot; based on poetry by Paul Celan, Arthur Rimbaud, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and William Shakespeare. His &quot;Six Celan Songs&quot; off this collection were composed for Ute Lemper, with whom he recorded the album. Ute Lemper also performed in the 1992 concert film of the same name, directed by Volker Schlöndorff.

In 1993, Nyman&#x27;s popularity increased after he wrote the score to Jane Campion&#x27;s award-winning 1993 film &quot;The Piano&quot;. The album became a classical music best-seller, selling over three million copies. His soundtrack won an Ivor Novello Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA and an American Film Institute award, and nominated for a British Academy Award and a Golden Globe. 
He produced a soundtrack for the silent film &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;, which largely reworked material he wrote for the soundtrack of the 1996 video game &quot;Enemy Zero&quot;. 
His forays into Hollywood were &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), &quot;Ravenous&quot; (1999) (with musician Damon Albarn), and &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; (1999). &quot;Gattaca&quot; was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music.

In 1999, Nyman created a group called Foster&#x27;s Social Orchestra, which specialised in the work of Stephen Foster. One of their pieces appeared in the film &quot;Ravenous&quot; and an additional work, not used in the film, appeared on the soundtrack album.

===21st century===
In 2000, he produced an opera on the subject of cloning on a libretto by Victoria Hardie titled &quot;Facing Goya&quot;, an expansion of their one-act opera &quot;Vital Statistics&quot;. The lead, a widowed art banker, is written for contralto and the role was created by Hilary Summers. His newest operas are &quot;Man and Boy: Dada&quot; (2003) and &quot;Love Counts&quot; (2005), both on libretti by Michael Hastings.

From 2002 to 2005 he was a composer-in-residence at the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe, Germany.

He composed the music for the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Titch&quot; which is based on the books written and illustrated by Pat Hutchins.

On 7 July 2007, Nyman performed at Live Earth in Japan. Nyman began a long-term artistic collaboration with the filmmaker Max Pugh which resulted in many short art films, three experimental feature documentaries and a number of video installations. In 2008 Nyman realised, in collaboration with the cultural association Volumina, &quot;Sublime&quot;, an artist&#x27;s book that unified his music with his passion for photography.

In October 2009, Nyman released &quot;The Glare&quot;, a collaborative collection of songs with David McAlmont. The album – recorded with the Michael Nyman Band – finds McAlmont putting lyrics based on contemporary news stories to 11 pieces of Nyman music drawn from different phases of his career. 

In 2012, he made a soundtrack for film, &quot;Everyday&quot;. Keith H. Yoo in 2012 commissioned Nyman to write a 26-minute piano quintet in four movements titled &quot;Through the Only Window&quot;. It premiered at the gala dinner for his father Yoo Byung-eun&#x27;s photographic exhibition &quot;Through My Window&quot; in the Tuileries Garden of The Louvre in Paris on 25 June 2012. The work has been recorded by Nyman Quintet in the Abbey Road Studios, and has been released on Nyman&#x27;s record label. In 2013 Nyman was again commissioned to compose a piece for Yoo Byung-eun&#x27;s exhibition in the Orangerie Hall of the Palace of Versailles, and wrote the 32-minute-long symphony in four movements, Symphony No. 6&quot;AHAE&quot;, representing the four seasons in nature as depicted by Ahae, a pseudonym for Yoo Byung-eun. The London Symphony Orchestra premiered both pieces at L&#x27;Opéra of the Palace of Versailles in Paris on 8 September 2013 under the baton of the composer. They were also recorded. In 2015 he performed in Dziga Vertov&#x27;s &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; at the Potemkin Stairs. The show was part of the 6th Odesa International Film Festival and gathered approximately 15,000 spectators.

== Personal life ==
He was married to Aet Nyman (née Toome), with whom he has two daughters, Molly and Martha. His first string quartet quotes &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; in homage to Aet, who appears in Greenaway&#x27;s &quot;The Falls&quot;, for which he also composed music. Molly is also a composer and in collaboration with Harry Escott has written several film scores, including for &quot;The Road to Guantanamo&quot; by her father&#x27;s frequent collaborator Michael Winterbottom. Martha is a development researcher for the BBC.

In 2005, Nyman reported that he had been a supporter of Queens Park Rangers F.C. for 33 years.

== Honours ==
Nyman was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

Nyman was awarded an honorary doctorate (DLitt) from the University of Warwick on 30 January 2007. At the degree ceremony, the University of Warwick Brass Society and Chamber Choir, conducted by Paul McGrath, premiered a specially composed procession and recession fanfare by Nyman.

In 2015, he was awarded the Golden Duke for Lifetime Achievement, the special award of the 6th Odesa International Film Festival.

<text>The Upanishads (; , , ) are late Vedic and post-Vedic Sanskrit texts that &quot;document the transition from the archaic ritualism of the Veda into new religious ideas and institutions&quot; and the emergence of the central religious concepts of Hinduism. They are the most recent addition to the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, and deal with meditation, philosophy, consciousness, and ontological knowledge. Earlier parts of the Vedas dealt with mantras, benedictions, rituals, ceremonies, and sacrifices.

While among the most important literature in the history of Indian religions and culture, the Upanishads document a wide variety of &quot;rites, incantations, and esoteric knowledge&quot; departing from Vedic ritualism and interpreted in various ways in the later commentarial traditions. The Upanishads are widely known, and their diverse ideas, interpreted in various ways, informed later traditions of Hinduism. The central concern of all Upanishads is to discover the relations between ritual, cosmic realities (including gods), and the human body/person, postulating Ātman and Brahman as the &quot;summit of the hierarchically arranged and interconnected universe&quot;, but various ideas about the relation between Atman and Brahman can be found.

108 Upanishads are known, of which the first dozen or so are the oldest and most important and are referred to as the principal or main (&quot;mukhya&quot;) Upanishads. The &quot;mukhya&quot; Upanishads are found mostly in the concluding part of the &quot;Brahmanas&quot; and &quot;Aranyakas&quot; and were, for centuries, memorized by each generation and passed down orally. The &quot;mukhya&quot; Upanishads predate the Common Era, but there is no scholarly consensus on their date, or even on which ones are pre- or post-Buddhist. The &quot;Brhadaranyaka&quot; is seen as particularly ancient by modern scholars. Of the remainder, 95 Upanishads are part of the Muktikā canon, composed from about the last centuries of 1st-millennium BCE through about 15th-century CE. New Upanishads, beyond the 108 in the Muktika canon, continued to be composed through the early modern and modern era, though often dealing with subjects that are unconnected to the Vedas. The &quot;mukhya&quot; Upanishads, along with the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and the Brahmasutra (known collectively as the &quot;Prasthanatrayi&quot;), are interpreted in divergent ways in the several later schools of Vedanta.

Translations of the Upanishads in the early 19th century started to attract attention from a Western audience. German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer was deeply impressed by the Upanishads and called them &quot;the most profitable and elevating reading which ... is possible in the world.&quot; Modern era Indologists have discussed the similarities between the fundamental concepts in the Upanishads and the works of major Western philosophers.

==Etymology==
The Sanskrit term &quot;&quot; originally meant “connection” or “equivalence&quot;, but came to be understood as &quot;sitting near a teacher,&quot; from &quot;upa&quot; &quot;by&quot; and &quot;ni-ṣad&quot; &quot;sit down&quot;, &quot;sitting down near&quot;, referring to the student sitting down near the teacher while receiving spiritual knowledge (Gurumukh). Other dictionary meanings include &quot;esoteric doctrine&quot; and &quot;secret doctrine&quot;. Monier-Williams&#x27; &quot;Sanskrit Dictionary&quot; notes – &quot;According to native authorities, Upanishad means setting to rest ignorance by revealing the knowledge of the supreme spirit.&quot;

Adi Shankaracharya explains in his commentary on the  and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad that the word means &quot;Ātmavidyā&quot;, that is, &quot;knowledge of the self&quot;, or &quot;Brahmavidyā&quot; &quot;knowledge of Brahman&quot;. The word appears in the verses of many Upanishads, such as the fourth verse of the 13th volume in the first chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad. Max Müller as well as Paul Deussen translate the word &quot;Upanishad&quot; in these verses as &quot;secret doctrine&quot;, Robert Hume translates it as &quot;mystic meaning&quot;, while Patrick Olivelle translates it as &quot;hidden connections&quot;.

==Development==

===Authorship===
The authorship of most Upanishads is unknown. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan states, &quot;almost all the early literature of India was anonymous, we do not know the names of the authors of the Upanishads&quot;. The ancient Upanishads are embedded in the Vedas, the oldest of Hinduism&#x27;s religious scriptures, which some traditionally consider to be &quot;apauruṣeya&quot;, which means &quot;not of a man, superhuman&quot; and &quot;impersonal, authorless&quot;. The Vedic texts assert that they were skillfully created by &quot;Rishis&quot; (sages), after inspired creativity, just as a carpenter builds a chariot.

The various philosophical theories in the early Upanishads have been attributed to famous sages such as Yajnavalkya, Uddalaka Aruni, Shvetaketu, Shandilya, Aitareya, Balaki, Pippalada, and Sanatkumara. Women, such as Maitreyi and Gargi, participate in the dialogues and are also credited in the early Upanishads. There are some exceptions to the anonymous tradition of the Upanishads. The Shvetashvatara Upanishad, for example, includes closing credits to sage &quot;Shvetashvatara&quot;, and he is considered the author of the Upanishad.

Many scholars believe that early Upanishads were interpolated and expanded over time. There are differences within manuscripts of the same Upanishad discovered in different parts of South Asia, differences in non-Sanskrit version of the texts that have survived, and differences within each text in terms of meter, style, grammar and structure. The existing texts are believed to be the work of many authors.

===Chronology===
Scholars are uncertain about when the Upanishads were composed. The chronology of the early Upanishads is difficult to resolve, states philosopher and Sanskritist Stephen Phillips, because all opinions rest on scanty evidence and analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, and are driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies. Indologist Patrick Olivelle says that &quot;in spite of claims made by some, in reality, any dating of these documents [early Upanishads] that attempts a precision closer than a few centuries is as stable as a house of cards&quot;.

Some scholars have tried to analyse similarities between Hindu Upanishads and Buddhist literature to establish chronology for the Upanishads. Precise dates are impossible, and most scholars give only broad ranges encompassing various centuries. Gavin Flood states that &quot;the Upanisads are not a homogeneous group of texts. Even the older texts were composed over a wide expanse of time from about 600 to 300 BCE.&quot; Stephen Phillips places the early or &quot;principal&quot; Upanishads in the 800 to 300 BCE range.

Patrick Olivelle, a Sanskrit Philologist and Indologist, gives the following chronology for the early Upanishads, also called the Principal Upanishads:
* The &quot;Brhadaranyaka&quot; and the &quot;Chandogya&quot; are the two earliest Upanishads. They are edited texts, some of whose sources are much older than others. The two texts are pre-Buddhist; they may be placed in the 7th to 6th centuries BCE, give or take a century or so.
* The three other early prose Upanishads—&quot;Taittiriya, Aitareya&quot;, and &quot;Kausitaki&quot; come next; all are probably pre-Buddhist and can be assigned to the 6th to 5th centuries BCE.
* The Kena is the oldest of the verse Upanishads followed by probably the Katha, Isa, Svetasvatara, and Mundaka. All these Upanishads were composed probably in the last few centuries BCE. According to Olivelle, &quot;All exhibit strong theistic tendencies and are probably the earliest literary products of the theistic tradition, whose later literature includes the Bhagavad Gita and the Puranas.&quot; 
* The two late prose Upanishads, the Prasna and the Mandukya, cannot be much older than the beginning of the common era.
Meanwhile, the Indologist Johannes Bronkhorst argues for a later date for the Upanishads than has generally been accepted. Bronkhorst places even the oldest of the Upanishads, such as the &quot;Brhadaranyaka&quot; as possibly still being composed at &quot;a date close to Katyayana and Patañjali [the grammarian]&quot; (i.e., 2nd century BCE).

The later Upanishads, numbering about 95, also called minor Upanishads, are dated from the late 1st-millennium BCE to mid 2nd-millennium CE. Gavin Flood dates many of the twenty Yoga Upanishads to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period. Patrick Olivelle and other scholars date seven of the twenty Sannyasa Upanishads to likely have been complete sometime between the last centuries of the 1st-millennium BCE to 300 CE. About half of the Sannyasa Upanishads were likely composed in 14th- to 15th-century CE.

===Geography===

The general area of the composition of the early Upanishads is considered as northern India. The region is bounded on the west by the upper Indus valley, on the east by lower Ganges region, on the north by the Himalayan foothills, and on the south by the Vindhya mountain range. Scholars are reasonably sure that the early Upanishads were produced at the geographical center of ancient Brahmanism, Kuru-Panchala, and Kosala-Videha, a &quot;frontier region&quot; of Brahmanism, together with the areas immediately to the south and west of these. This region covers modern Bihar, Nepal, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, eastern Rajasthan, and northern Madhya Pradesh.

While significant attempts have been made recently to identify the exact locations of the individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad. The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more western than eastern location in the Indian subcontinent, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.

Compared to the Principal Upanishads, the new Upanishads recorded in the belong to an entirely different region, probably southern India, and are considerably relatively recent. In the fourth chapter of the Kaushitaki Upanishad, a location named Kashi (modern Varanasi) is mentioned.

==Classification ==

===Muktika canon: major and minor Upanishads===
There are more than 200 known &quot;Upanishads&quot;, one of which, the &quot;&quot; Upanishad, predates 1656 CE and contains a list of 108 canonical Upanishads, including itself as the last. These are further divided into Upanishads associated with Shaktism (goddess Shakti), Sannyasa (renunciation, monastic life), Shaivism (god Shiva), Vaishnavism (god Vishnu), Yoga, and &quot;Sāmānya&quot; (general, sometimes referred to as Samanya-Vedanta).

Some of the Upanishads are categorized as &quot;sectarian&quot; since they present their ideas through a particular god or goddess of a specific Hindu tradition such as Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti, or a combination of these such as the Skanda Upanishad. These traditions sought to link their texts as Vedic, by asserting their texts to be an Upanishad, thereby a &quot;Śruti&quot;. Most of these sectarian Upanishads, for example the Rudrahridaya Upanishad and the Mahanarayana Upanishad, assert that all the Hindu gods and goddesses are the same, all an aspect and manifestation of Brahman, the Vedic concept for metaphysical ultimate reality before and after the creation of the Universe.

===Principal Upanishads===

The Principal Upanishads, also known as the &quot;Mukhya Upanishads&quot;, can be grouped into periods. Of the early periods are the &quot;Brihadaranyaka&quot; and the &quot;Chandogya&quot;, the oldest.
The Aitareya, Kauṣītaki and Taittirīya Upanishads may date to as early as the mid-1st millennium BCE, while the remnant date from between roughly the 4th to 1st centuries BCE, roughly contemporary with the earliest portions of the Sanskrit epics. One chronology assumes that the &quot;Aitareya, Taittiriya, Kausitaki, Mundaka, Prasna&quot;, and &quot;Katha Upanishads&quot; has Buddha&#x27;s influence, and is consequently placed after the 5th century BCE, while another proposal questions this assumption and dates it independent of Buddha&#x27;s date of birth. The &quot;Kena&quot;, &quot;Mandukya,&quot; and &quot;Isa Upanishads&quot; are typically placed after these Principal Upanishads, but other scholars date these differently. Not much is known about the authors except for those, like Yajnavalkayva and Uddalaka, mentioned in the texts. A few women discussants, such as Gargi and Maitreyi, the wife of Yajnavalkayva, also feature occasionally.

Each of the principal &quot;Upanishads&quot; can be associated with one of the schools of exegesis of the four Vedas (&quot;shakhas&quot;). Many Shakhas are said to have existed, of which only a few remain. The new &quot;Upanishads&quot; often have little relation to the Vedic corpus and have not been cited or commented upon by any great Vedanta philosopher: their language differs from that of the classic &quot;Upanishads&quot;, being less subtle and more formalized. As a result, they are not difficult to comprehend for the modern reader.

===New Upanishads===
There is no fixed list of the &quot;Upanishads&quot; as newer ones, beyond the Muktika anthology of 108 Upanishads, have continued to be discovered and composed. In 1908, for example, four previously unknown Upanishads were discovered in newly found manuscripts, and these were named &quot;Bashkala&quot;, &quot;Chhagaleya&quot;, &quot;Arsheya&quot;, and &quot;Saunaka&quot;, by Friedrich Schrader, who attributed them to the first prose period of the Upanishads. The text of three of them, namely the &quot;Chhagaleya&quot;, &quot;Arsheya&quot;, and &quot;Saunaka&quot;, were incomplete and inconsistent, likely poorly maintained or corrupted.

Ancient Upanishads have long enjoyed a revered position in Hindu traditions, and authors of numerous sectarian texts have tried to benefit from this reputation by naming their texts as Upanishads. These &quot;new Upanishads&quot; number in the hundreds, cover diverse range of topics from physiology to renunciation to sectarian theories. They were composed between the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE through the early modern era (~1600 CE). While over two dozen of the minor Upanishads are dated to pre-3rd century CE, many of these new texts under the title of &quot;Upanishads&quot; originated in the first half of the 2nd millennium CE, they are not Vedic texts, and some do not deal with themes found in the Vedic Upanishads.

The main Shakta Upanishads, for example, mostly discuss doctrinal and interpretative differences between the two principal sects of a major Tantric form of Shaktism called Shri Vidya upasana. The many extant lists of authentic &quot;Shakta Upaniṣads&quot; vary, reflecting the sect of their compilers, so that they yield no evidence of their &quot;location&quot; in Tantric tradition, impeding correct interpretation. The Tantra content of these texts also weaken its identity as an Upaniṣad for non-Tantrikas. Sectarian texts such as these do not enjoy status as shruti and thus the authority of the new Upanishads as scripture is not accepted in Hinduism.

===Association with Vedas===
All Upanishads are associated with one of the four Vedas—Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda (there are two primary versions or &quot;Samhitas&quot; of the Yajurveda: Shukla Yajurveda, Krishna Yajurveda), and Atharvaveda. During the modern era, the ancient Upanishads that were embedded texts in the Vedas, were detached from the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of Vedic text, compiled into separate texts and these were then gathered into anthologies of the Upanishads. These lists associated each Upanishad with one of the four Vedas. Many such lists exist but they are inconsistent across India in terms of which Upanishads are included and how the newer Upanishads are assigned to the ancient Vedas. In south India, the collected list based on Muktika Upanishad, and published in Telugu language, became the most common by the 19th-century and this is a list of 108 Upanishads. In north India, a list of 52 Upanishads has been most common.

The Upanishad&#x27;s list of 108 Upanishads groups the first 13 as &quot;mukhya&quot;, 21 as Sāmānya Vedānta, 18 as Sannyāsa, 14 as Vaishnava, 14 as Shaiva, 8 as Shakta, and 20 as Yoga. The 108 Upanishads as recorded in the are shown in the table below. The mukhya Upanishads are the most important and highlighted.

==Philosophy==

The central concern of all Upanishads is to discover the relations between ritual, cosmic realities (including gods), and the human body/person, postulating Ātman and Brahman as the &quot;summit of the hierarchically arranged and interconnected universe,&quot; but various ideas about the relation between Atman and Brahman can be found.

The Upanishads reflect a pluralism of worldviews. While some Upanishads have been deemed &#x27;monistic&#x27;, others, including the Katha Upanishad, are dualistic. The Maitri is one of the Upanishads that inclines more toward dualism, thus grounding classical Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism, in contrast to the non-dualistic Upanishads at the foundation of its Vedanta school. They contain a plurality of ideas.

The Upanishads include sections on philosophical theories that have been at the foundation of Indian traditions. For example, the Chandogya Upanishad includes one of the earliest known declarations of Ahimsa (non-violence) as an ethical precept. Discussion of other ethical premises such as Damah (temperance, self-restraint), Satya (truthfulness), Dāna (charity), Ārjava (non-hypocrisy), Daya (compassion), and others are found in the oldest Upanishads and many later Upanishads. Similarly, the Karma doctrine is presented in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, which is the oldest Upanishad.

===Development of thought===
While the hymns of the Vedas emphasize rituals and the Brahmanas serve as a liturgical manual for those Vedic rituals, the spirit of the Upanishads is inherently opposed to ritual. The older Upanishads launch attacks of increasing intensity on the ritual. Anyone who worships a divinity other than the self is called a domestic animal of the gods in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. The Upanishad parodies those who indulge in the acts of sacrifice by comparing them with a procession of dogs chanting &quot;Om! Let&#x27;s eat. Om! Let&#x27;s drink&quot;.

The Kaushitaki Upanishad asserts that &quot;external rituals such as Agnihotram offered in the morning and in the evening, must be replaced with inner Agnihotram, the ritual of introspection&quot;, and that &quot;not rituals, but knowledge should be one&#x27;s pursuit&quot;. The Mundaka Upanishad declares how man has been called upon, promised benefits for, scared unto and misled into performing sacrifices, oblations and pious works. Mundaka thereafter asserts this is foolish and frail, by those who encourage it and those who follow it, because it makes no difference to man&#x27;s current life and after-life, it is like blind men leading the blind, it is a mark of conceit and vain knowledge, ignorant inertia like that of children, a futile useless practice. The Maitri Upanishad states,

The opposition to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend the task of the Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or &quot;ashvamedha&quot; allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then goes on to say that spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of a horse.

In similar fashion, Vedic gods such as the &quot;Agni&quot;, &quot;Aditya&quot;, &quot;Indra&quot;, &quot;Rudra&quot;, &quot;Visnu&quot;, &quot;Brahma&quot;, and others become equated in the Upanishads to the supreme, immortal, and incorporeal Brahman-Atman of the Upanishads, god becomes synonymous with self, and is declared to be everywhere, inmost being of each human being and within every living creature. The one reality or &quot;ekam sat&quot; of the Vedas becomes the &quot;ekam eva advitiyam&quot; or &quot;the one and only and sans a second&quot; in the Upanishads. Brahman-Atman and self-realization develops, in the Upanishad, as the means to moksha (liberation; freedom in this life or after-life).

According to Jayatilleke, the thinkers of Upanishadic texts can be grouped into two categories. One group, which includes early Upanishads along with some middle and late Upanishads, were composed by metaphysicians who used rational arguments and empirical experience to formulate their speculations and philosophical premises. The second group includes many middle and later Upanishads, where their authors professed theories based on yoga and personal experiences. Yoga philosophy and practice, adds Jayatilleke, is &quot;not entirely absent in the Early Upanishads&quot;.

The development of thought in these Upanishadic theories contrasted with Buddhism, since the Upanishadic inquiry fails to find an empirical correlate of the assumed Atman, but nevertheless assumes its existence, &quot;[reifying] consciousness as an eternal self.&quot; The Buddhist inquiry &quot;is satisfied with the empirical investigation which shows that no such Atman exists because there is no evidence,&quot; states Jayatilleke.

===Atman and Brahman ===
The Upanishads postulate Ātman and Brahman as the &quot;summit of the hierarchically arranged and interconnected universe.&quot; Both have multiple meanings, and various ideas about the relation between Atman and Brahman can be found.

Atman has &quot;a wide range of lexical meanings, including ‘breath’, ‘spirit’, and ‘body’.&quot; In the Upanishads it refers to the body, but also to the essence of the concrete physical human body, &quot;an essence, a life-force, consciousness, or ultimate reality.&quot; The Chāndogya Upaniṣhad (6.1-16) &quot;offers an organic understanding of ātman, characterizing the self in terms of the life force that animates all living beings,&quot; while the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣhad &quot;characterizes ātman more in terms of consciousness than as a life-giving essence.&quot;

Brahman may refer to a &quot;formulation of truth,&quot; but also to &quot;the ultimate and basic essence of the cosmos,&quot; standing at the &quot;summit of the hierarchical scheme, or at the bottom as the ultimate foundation of all things.&quot; Brahman is &quot;beyond the reach of human perception and thought.&quot; Atman likewise has multiple meanings, one of them being &#x27;self&#x27;, the inner essence of a human body/person.

Various ideas about the relation between Atman and Brahman can be found. Two distinct, somewhat divergent themes stand out. Older upanishads state that &quot;Atman&quot; is part of Brahman but not identical, while younger Upanishads state that Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Principle, Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is identical with &quot;Atman&quot;. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana ( 100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories. According to Nakamura, the Brahmasutras see Atman and Brahman as both different and not-different, a point of view which came to be called &quot;bhedabheda&quot; in later times. According to Koller, the Brahmasutras state that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and in the state of self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different. This ancient debate flowered into various dual, non-dual theories in Hinduism.

===Reality and Maya===

Two different types of the non-dual Brahman-Atman are presented in the Upanishads, according to Mahadevan. The one in which the non-dual Brahman-Atman is the all-inclusive ground of the universe and another in which empirical, changing reality is an appearance (Maya).

The Upanishads describe the universe, and the human experience, as an interplay of Purusha (the eternal, unchanging principles, consciousness) and Prakṛti (the temporary, changing material world, nature). The former manifests itself as Ātman (soul, self), and the latter as Māyā. The Upanishads refer to the knowledge of &quot;Atman&quot; as &quot;true knowledge&quot; (&quot;Vidya&quot;), and the knowledge of &quot;Maya&quot; as &quot;not true knowledge&quot; (&quot;Avidya&quot;, Nescience, lack of awareness, lack of true knowledge).

Hendrick Vroom explains, &quot;the term &quot;Maya&quot; [in the Upanishads] has been translated as &#x27;illusion,&#x27; but then it does not concern normal illusion. Here &#x27;illusion&#x27; does not mean that the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. &quot;Maya&quot; means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned.&quot; According to Wendy Doniger, &quot;to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge.&quot;

In the Upanishads, Māyā is the perceived changing reality and it co-exists with Brahman which is the hidden true reality. &quot;Maya&quot;, or &quot;illusion&quot;, is an important idea in the Upanishads, because the texts assert that in the human pursuit of blissful and liberating self-knowledge, it is &quot;Maya&quot; which obscures, confuses and distracts an individual.

==Schools of Vedanta==

The Upanishads form one of the three main sources for all schools of Vedanta, together with the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahmasutras. Due to the wide variety of philosophical teachings contained in the Upanishads, various interpretations could be grounded on the Upanishads. The schools of Vedānta seek to answer questions about the relation between atman and Brahman, and the relation between Brahman and the world. The schools of Vedanta are named after the relation they see between atman and Brahman:
* According to Advaita Vedanta, there is no difference.
* According to Vishishtadvaita the jīvātman is a part of Brahman, and hence is similar, but not identical.
* According to Dvaita, all individual souls (jīvātmans) and matter as eternal and mutually separate entities.

Other schools of Vedanta include Nimbarkacharya&#x27;s &quot;Svabhavika Bhedabheda&quot;, Vallabha&#x27;s &quot;Suddhadvaita&quot;, and Chaitanya&#x27;s &quot;Acintya Bhedabheda&quot;. The philosopher Adi Shankara has provided commentaries on 11 mukhya Upanishads.

===Advaita Vedanta===
Advaita literally means non-duality, and it is a monistic system of thought. It deals with the non-dual nature of Brahman and Atman. Advaita is considered the most influential sub-school of the &quot;Vedanta&quot; school of Hindu philosophy. Gaudapada was the first person to expound the basic principles of the Advaita philosophy in a commentary on the conflicting statements of the Upanishads. Gaudapada&#x27;s Advaita ideas were further developed by Shankara (8th century CE). King states that Gaudapada&#x27;s main work, Māṇḍukya Kārikā, is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism, and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies. King also suggests that there are clear differences between Shankara&#x27;s writings and the &quot;Brahmasutra&quot;, and many ideas of Shankara are at odds with those in the Upanishads. Radhakrishnan, on the other hand, suggests that Shankara&#x27;s views of Advaita were straightforward developments of the Upanishads and the &quot;Brahmasutra&quot;, and many ideas of Shankara derive from the Upanishads.

Shankara in his discussions of the Advaita Vedanta philosophy referred to the early Upanishads to explain the key difference between Hinduism and Buddhism, stating that Hinduism asserts that Atman (soul, self) exists, whereas Buddhism asserts that there is no soul, no self.

Shankara used four sentences from the Upanishads, called the Mahāvākyas (Great Sayings), to establish the identity of Atman and Brahman as scriptural truth:
* &quot;Prajñānam brahma&quot; - &quot;Consciousness is Brahman&quot; (Aitareya Upanishad)
* &quot;Aham brahmāsmi&quot; - &quot;I am Brahman&quot; (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad)
* &quot;Tat tvam asi&quot; - &quot;That Thou art&quot; (Chandogya Upanishad)
* &quot;Ayamātmā brahma&quot; - &quot;This Atman is Brahman&quot; (Mandukya Upanishad)

=== Bhedabheda ===
Vijñānabhikṣu countered Advaita emphasis on non-difference of the self and Brahman by pointing to statements from the Upanishads that support difference.

===Vishishtadvaita===
Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE), the main proponent of the Vishishtadvaita philosophy, disagreed with Adi Shankara and the Advaita school. Visistadvaita is a synthetic philosophy bridging the monistic Advaita and theistic Dvaita systems of Vedanta. Ramanuja frequently cited the Upanishads, and stated that Vishishtadvaita is grounded in the Upanishads.

Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita interpretation of the Upanishads is that of qualified monism. Ramanuja interprets the Upanishadic literature to be teaching a body-soul theory, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, where the Brahman is the dweller in all things, yet also distinct and beyond all things, as the soul, the inner controller, the immortal. The Upanishads, according to the Vishishtadvaita school, teach individual souls to be of the same quality as the Brahman, but quantitatively distinct.

In the Vishishtadvaita school, the Upanishads are interpreted to be teaching about Ishvara (Vishnu), who is the seat of all auspicious qualities, with all of the empirically perceived world as the body of God who dwells in everything. The school recommends a devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of a personal god. This ultimately leads one to the oneness with abstract Brahman. The Brahman in the Upanishads is a living reality, states Fowler, and &quot;the Atman of all things and all beings&quot; in Ramanuja&#x27;s interpretation.

===Dvaita===
The Dvaita school was founded by Madhvacharya (1199–1278 CE). It is regarded as a strongly theistic philosophic exposition of the Upanishads. Madhvacharya, much like Adi Shankara claims for Advaita, and Ramanuja claims for Vishishtadvaita, states that his theistic Dvaita Vedanta is grounded in the Upanishads.

According to the Dvaita school, states Fowler, the &quot;Upanishads that speak of the soul as Brahman, speak of resemblance and not identity&quot;. Madhvacharya interprets the Upanishadic teachings of the self becoming one with Brahman, as &quot;entering into Brahman&quot;, just like a drop enters an ocean. This to the Dvaita school implies duality and dependence, where Brahman and Atman are different realities. Brahman is a separate, independent and supreme reality in the Upanishads, Atman only resembles the Brahman in limited, inferior, dependent manner according to Madhvacharya.

Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita school and Shankara&#x27;s Advaita school are both nondualism Vedanta schools, both are premised on the assumption that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned.

==Similarities with Platonic thought==
Several scholars have recognised parallels between the philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato and that of the Upanishads, including their ideas on sources of knowledge, concept of justice and path to salvation, and Plato&#x27;s allegory of the cave. Platonic psychology with its divisions of reason, spirit and appetite, also bears resemblance to the three &quot;Guṇas&quot; in the Indian philosophy of Samkhya.

Various mechanisms for such a transmission of knowledge have been conjectured including Pythagoras traveling as far as India; Indian philosophers visiting Athens and meeting Socrates; Plato encountering the ideas when in exile in Syracuse; or, intermediated through Persia.

However, other scholars, such as Arthur Berriedale Keith, J. Burnet and A. R. Wadia, believe that the two systems developed independently. They note that there is no historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out significant differences in the stage of development, orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato&#x27;s metaphysics were rooted in &quot;this&quot; life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual&#x27;s moksha (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).

==Translations==
The Upanishads have been translated into various languages including Persian, Italian, Urdu, French, Latin, German, English, Dutch, Polish, Japanese, Spanish and Russian. The Mughal Emperor Akbar&#x27;s reign (1556–1586) saw the first translations of the Upanishads into Persian. His great-grandson, Dara Shukoh, produced a collection called &quot;Sirr-i-Akbar&quot; in 1656, wherein 50 Upanishads were translated from Sanskrit into Persian.

Anquetil-Duperron, a French Orientalist, received a manuscript of the &quot;Oupanekhat&quot; and translated the Persian version into French and Latin, publishing the Latin translation in two volumes in 1801–1802 as &quot;Oupneck&#x27;hat&quot;. The French translation was never published. More recently, several translations in French of some Upanishads or the whole of 108 have been published : by indianists Louis Renou, &quot;Kausitaki, Svetasvatra, Prasna, Taittiriya Upanisads&quot;, 1948; Jean Varenne, &quot;Mahâ-Nârâyana Upanisad&quot;, 1960, and &quot;Sept Upanishads&quot;, 1981; Alyette Degrâces-Fadh, &quot;Samnyâsa-Upanisad (Upanisad du renoncement)&quot;, 1989; Martine Buttex, &quot;Les 108 Upanishads&quot; (full translation), 2012.
The Latin version was the initial introduction of the Upanishadic thought to Western scholars. However, according to Deussen, the Persian translators took great liberties in translating the text and at times changed the meaning.

The first Sanskrit-to-English translation of the Aitareya Upanishad was made by Colebrooke in 1805, and the first English translation of the Kena Upanishad was made by Rammohun Roy in 1816.

The first German translation appeared in 1832 and Roer&#x27;s English version appeared in 1853. However, Max Mueller&#x27;s 1879 and 1884 editions were the first systematic English treatment to include the 12 Principal Upanishads. Other major translations of the Upanishads have been by Robert Ernest Hume (13 Principal Upanishads), Paul Deussen (60 Upanishads), Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (18 Upanishads), Patrick Olivelle (32 Upanishads in two books) and Bhānu Swami (13 Upanishads with commentaries of Vaiṣṇava ācāryas). Olivelle&#x27;s translation won the 1998 A.K. Ramanujan Book Prize for Translation.

Throughout the 1930s, Irish poet W. B. Yeats worked with the Indian-born mendicant-teacher Shri Purohit Swami on their own translation of the Upanishads, eventually titled &quot;The Ten Principal Upanishads&quot; and published in 1938. This translation was the final piece of work published by Yeats before his death less than a year later.

==Reception in the West==
The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer read the Latin translation and praised the Upanishads in his main work, &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; (1819), as well as in his &quot;Parerga and Paralipomena&quot; (1851). He found his own philosophy in accord with the Upanishads, which taught that the individual is a manifestation of the one basis of reality. For Schopenhauer, that fundamentally real underlying unity is what we know in ourselves as &quot;will&quot;. Schopenhauer used to keep a copy of the Latin &quot;Oupnekhet&quot; by his side and commented,
Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy influenced many famous people and introduced them to the Upanishads. One of them was the Austrian Physicist Erwin Schrödinger, who once wrote:

Another German philosopher, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, praised the ideas in the Upanishads, as did others. In the United States, the group known as the Transcendentalists were influenced by the German idealists. Americans, such as Emerson and Thoreau embraced Schelling&#x27;s interpretation of Kant&#x27;s Transcendental idealism, as well as his celebration of the romantic, exotic, mystical aspect of the Upanishads. As a result of the influence of these writers, the Upanishads gained renown in Western countries.

The poet T. S. Eliot, inspired by his reading of the Upanishads, based the final portion of his famous poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922) upon one of its verses. According to Eknath Easwaran, the Upanishads are snapshots of towering peaks of consciousness.

Juan Mascaró, a professor at the University of Barcelona and a translator of the Upanishads, states that the Upanishads represents for the Hindu approximately what the New Testament represents for the Christian, and that the message of the Upanishads can be summarized in the words, &quot;the kingdom of God is within you&quot;.

Paul Deussen in his review of the Upanishads, states that the texts emphasize Brahman-Atman as something that can be experienced, but not defined. This view of the soul and self are similar, states Deussen, to those found in the dialogues of Plato and elsewhere. The Upanishads insisted on oneness of soul, excluded all plurality, and therefore, all proximity in space, all succession in time, all interdependence as cause and effect, and all opposition as subject and object. Max Müller, in his review of the Upanishads, summarizes the lack of systematic philosophy and the central theme in the Upanishads as follows,

<text>Mira Nair (born 15 October 1957) is an Indian-American filmmaker based in New York City. Her production company is Mirabai Films. Among her films are &quot;Mississippi Masala&quot;, &quot;The Namesake&quot;, the Golden Lion–winning &quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot;, and &quot;Salaam Bombay!&quot;, which received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.

==Early life and education==
Nair was born in Rourkela, Orissa, India, and grew up with her two older brothers and parents in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. Her father, Amrit Lal Nair, was an officer of the Indian Administrative Service, and her mother, Parveen Nayyar, was a social worker.

She lived in Bhubaneswar until age 18, and attended a convent, following which she left to attend Loreto Convent, Tara Hall, Shimla, an Irish-Catholic missionary school, where she developed an infatuation with English literature. Nair then went on to study at Miranda House at Delhi University, where she majored in sociology. Nair applied for transfer to Western schools and, at 19, she attended Harvard University on a scholarship.

==Career==
Before she became a filmmaker, Nair was originally interested in acting, and at one point she performed plays written by Badal Sarkar, a Bengali performer. While she studied at Harvard University, Nair became involved in the theater program and won a Boylston Prize for her performance of Jocasta&#x27;s speech from Seneca&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus&quot;.

Nair commented on film-making in a 2004 interview with FF2 Media&#x27;s Jan Huttner:It’s all in how I do it. Keeping the buns on the seats is very important to me. It requires that ineffable thing called rhythm and balance in movie-making. Foils have to be created, counter-weights. From the intimacy, let’s say, of a love scene to the visceral, jugular quality of war. That shift is something in the editing, how one cuts from the intimate to the epic that keeps you there waiting. The energy propels you.Nair said to &quot;Image Journal&quot; in 2017 that she chose directing over any other art form because it was collaborative. &quot;That’s why I am neither a photographer nor writer,&quot; she said. &quot;I like to work with people, and my strength, if any, is that. Working with life.&quot;

===Documentaries===
At the start of her film-making career, Nair primarily made documentaries in which she explored Indian cultural tradition. For her film thesis at Harvard between 1978 and 1979, Nair produced a black-and-white film titled &quot;Jama Masjid Street Journal&quot;. In the 18-minute film, Nair explored the streets of Old Delhi and had casual conversations with Indian locals.

In 1982, she made her second documentary titled &quot;So Far from India&quot;, which is a 52-minute film that followed an Indian newspaper dealer living in the subways of New York, while his pregnant wife waited for him to return home. This film was recognized as a Best Documentary winner at the American Film Festival and New York&#x27;s Global Village Film Festival.

Her third documentary, &quot;India Cabaret&quot;, released in 1984, revealed the exploitation of female strippers in Bombay, and followed a customer who regularly visited a local strip club while his wife stayed at home. Nair raised roughly $130,000 for the project. The 59-minute film was shot over a span of two months. It was criticized by Nair&#x27;s family. Her fourth and last documentary, made for Canadian television, explored how amniocentesis was being used to determine the sex of fetuses.

In 2001, with The Laughing Club of India, she explored laughter based on yoga. Founder Dr. Madan Kararia spoke of the club&#x27;s history and the growth of laughing clubs across the country, and subsequently the world. The documentary included testimonials from members of the laughter clubs who described how the practice had improved or changed their lives. Its featured segments included a group of workers in an electrical products factory in Mumbai who took time off to laugh during their coffee break.

In 1983 with her friend Sooni Taraporevala, Nair co-wrote &quot;Salaam Bombay!&quot;. Nair sought out real &quot;street children&quot; to more authentically portray the lives of children who survived in the streets and were deprived of a true childhood. Though the film did not do well at the box office, it won 23 international awards, including the Camera D’or and Prix du Public at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. It was nominated at the 1989 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.

Nair and Taraporevala next worked together on the 1991 film &quot;Mississippi Masala,&quot; which told the story of Ugandan-born Indians displaced in Mississippi. The film centers on a carpet-cleaner business owner (Denzel Washington) who falls in love with the daughter (Sarita Choudhury) of one of his Indian clients. The film revealed the prejudice in African-American and Indian communities. It was well received by critics, earned a standing ovation at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival, and won three awards at the Venice Film Festival.

Nair went on to direct four more films before she produced &quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot;. Released in 2001, the film told the story of a Punjabi Indian wedding, written by Sabrina Dhawan. Employing a small crew and casting some of Nair&#x27;s acquaintances and relatives, the film grossed over $30 million worldwide. The film was awarded the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival, making Nair the first female recipient of the award. Nair then directed the Golden Globe-winning &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot; (2002), followed by making William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s epic &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (2004).

In 2007, Nair was asked to direct &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, but turned it down to work on &quot;The Namesake&quot;. Based on the book by Pulitzer Prize-winner Jhumpa Lahiri, Sooni Taraporevala&#x27;s screenplay follows the son of Indian immigrants who wants to fit in with New York City society, but struggles to get away from his family&#x27;s traditional ways. The film was presented with the Dartmouth Film Award and was also honored with the Pride of India award at the Bollywood Movie Awards. 

This was followed by the Amelia Earhart biopic &quot;Amelia&quot; (2009), starring Hilary Swank and Richard Gere. The film received predominantly negative reviews. It was also a box-office bomb, grossing $19.6 million against a budget of $40 million.

In 2012, Nair directed &quot;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&quot;, a thriller based on the best-selling novel by Mohsin Hamid. It received mixed reviews from critics, and was a box office bomb, earning only $2.1 million worldwide on a $15 million budget. It opened the 2012 Venice Film Festival to critical acclaim and was released worldwide in early 2013. &quot;The Journal of Commonwealth Literature&quot; questioned &quot;how the ambivalence and provocativeness of the &#x27;source&#x27; text translates into the film adaptation, and the extent to which the film format makes the narrative more palatable and appealing to wider audiences as compared to the novel’s target readership.&quot; 

Nair&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;Queen of Katwe&quot;, a Walt Disney Pictures production, starred Lupita Nyong&#x27;o and David Oyelowo and was based on the story of Ugandan chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi. It had a budget of $15 million, and grossed $10.4 million.

===Short films===
Nair&#x27;s short films include &quot;A Fork, a Spoon and a Knight,&quot; inspired by the Nelson Mandela quote, ″Difficulties break some men but make others.″ She contributed to &quot;11&#x27;09&quot;01 September 11&quot; (2002) in which 11 filmmakers reacted to the events of 11 September 2001. Other titles include &quot;How Can It Be?&quot; (2008), &quot;Migration&quot; (2008), &quot;New York, I Love You&quot; (2009) and her collaboration with, among others, Emir Kusturica and Guillermo Arriaga on the compilation feature &quot;Words with Gods&quot;.

===Other work===
A longtime activist, Nair set up an annual film-makers&#x27; laboratory, Maisha Film Lab in Kampala, Uganda. Since 2005, young directors in East Africa have been trained at this non-profit facility with the belief that &quot;If we don&#x27;t tell our stories, no one else will&quot;. Maisha as of 2018 was building a school with Architect Raul Pantaleo, winner of Aga Khan Award for Architecture, and his company Studio Tamassociati.

In 1998, she used the profits from &quot;Salaam Bombay!&quot; to create the Salaam Baalak Trust which works with street children in India.

A musical adaptation of &quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot;, directed by Nair, premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre, running from 5 May to 16 July 2017.

As of 2015, she lived in New York City, where she was an adjunct professor in the Film Division of the School of Arts for Columbia University. The university had a collaboration with Nair&#x27;s Maisha Film Lab, and offered opportunities for international students to work together and share their interests in film-making.

In July 2020, journalist Ellen Barry announced that her Pulitzer Prize-nominated story &quot;The Jungle Prince of Delhi&quot; about the &quot;royal family of Oudh&quot;, published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, would be adapted into a web series for Amazon Studios by Nair.

In March 2021 it was announced Nair would direct a ten episode TV series for Disney+ reimagining the &quot;National Treasure&quot; series with a new cast.

==Personal life==
In 1977, Nair met her first husband, photographer Mitch Epstein, when taking photography classes at Harvard University. They divorced by 1987. 

In 1988 Nair met her second husband, Indo-Ugandan political scientist Mahmood Mamdani, while in Uganda doing research for the film &quot;Mississippi Masala&quot;. Like his wife, Mamdani teaches at Columbia University. Their son, Zohran Mamdani, was born in Uganda in 1991. In 2020, Zohran won a seat representing Astoria, Queens, in the New York State Assembly after defeating incumbent Assembly member Aravella Simotas in the Democratic primary election earlier in the year. He is running for the office of mayor of New York City in 2025.

Nair has been an enthusiastic yoga practitioner for decades; when making a film, she has the cast and crew start the day with a yoga session.

==Political views==
In July 2013, Nair declined an invitation to the Haifa International Film Festival as a &quot;guest of honor&quot; to protest Israel&#x27;s policies toward Palestine. In postings on her Twitter account, Nair stated &quot;I will go to Israel when the walls come down. I will go to Israel when occupation is gone...I will go to Israel when the state does not privilege one religion over another. I will go to Israel when Apartheid is over. I will go to Israel, soon. I stand w/ Palestine for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) &amp; the larger Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) Mov’t.&quot; Nair was subsequently praised by PACBI, which stated that her decision to boycott Israel &quot;helps to highlight the struggle against colonialism and apartheid.&quot; She subsequently tweeted &quot;I will go to Israel, soon.&quot;

<text>In Greek mythology, Harmonia (; /harmoˈnia/, &quot;harmony&quot;, &quot;agreement&quot;) is the goddess of harmony and concord. Her Roman counterpart is Concordia. Her Greek opposite is Eris, whose Roman counterpart is Discordia.

==Family==

According to one account, she is the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite. By another account, Harmonia was from Samothrace and was the daughter of Zeus and Electra, her brothers were Dardanus and Iasion being the founder of the mystic rites celebrated on the island.

Almost always, Harmonia is married to Cadmus. With Cadmus, she was the mother of Ino, Polydorus, Autonoë, Agave, and Semele. Their youngest son was Illyrius.

== Mythology ==
Those who described Harmonia as a Samothracian related that Cadmus, on his voyage to Samothrace, after being initiated in the mysteries, perceived Harmonia and carried her off with the assistance of Athena. When Cadmus was obliged to quit Thebes, Harmonia accompanied him. When they came to the Enchelii, they assisted them in their war against the Illyrians, and conquered the enemy. Cadmus then became king of the Illyrians, but afterwards he was turned into a serpent. Harmonia, in her grief stripped herself, then begged Cadmus to come to her. As she was embraced by the serpent Cadmus in a pool of wine, the gods then turned her into a serpent, unable to stand watching her in her dazed state.

===The cursed necklace===

Harmonia is renowned in ancient story chiefly on account of the fatal necklace she received on her wedding day. When the government of Thebes was bestowed upon Cadmus by Athena, Zeus gave him Harmonia. All the gods honored the wedding with their presence. Cadmus presented the bride with a robe and necklace, which he had received either from Hephaestus or from Europa. This necklace, commonly referred to as the necklace of Harmonia, brought misfortune to all who possessed it. Other traditions stated that Harmonia received this necklace (ὅρμος) from some of the gods, either from Aphrodite or Athena.

Polynices, who inherited the necklace, gave it to Eriphyle, that she might persuade her husband, Amphiaraus, to undertake the expedition against Thebes. Through Alcmaeon, the son of Eriphyle, the necklace came into the hands of Arsinoe (named Alphesiboea in some versions), next into those of the sons of Phegeus, Pronous and Agenor, and lastly into those of the sons of Alcmaeon, Amphoterus and Acarnan, who dedicated it in the temple of Athena Pronoea at Delphi. The necklace had wrought mischief to all who had been in possession of it, and it continued to do so even after it was dedicated at Delphi. Phayllus, the tyrant, stole it from the temple to gratify his mistress, who is married to Ariston. She wore it for a time, but at last her youngest son was seized with madness, and set fire to the house, in which she perished with all her treasures.

Hyginus gives another version. According to him, the thing which brought ill fate to the descendants of Harmonia is not a necklace, but a robe &quot;dipped in crime&quot;, given to Harmonia by Hephestus and Hera. The necklace gave peace and held Harmonia&#x27;s powers in it, which is what made it cursed.

Harmonia is also rationalized as closely allied to Aphrodite Pandemos, the love that unites all people, the personification of order and civic unity, corresponding to the Roman goddess Concordia.

==History==
=== Indigenous ===
The indigenous peoples that resided in what is now San Bernardino County were primarily the Taaqtam (Serrano) and ʔívil̃uqaletem (Cahuilla) peoples who lived in the San Bernardino Valley and the San Bernardino Mountains; the Chemehuevi and the Kawaiisu peoples who lived in the Mojave Desert region; and the &#x27;Aha Makhav (Mohave) and the Piipaash (Maricopa) peoples who lived along the Colorado River. These groups established various villages and settlements throughout the region that were interconnected by a series of extensive trails.

Wa&#x27;aachnga was a major Tongva village site, also occupied by the Serrano and Cahuilla, located near what is now the city of San Bernardino. The village was part of an extensive trade network along the Mohave Trail that connected villages in San Bernardino County from the Colorado River to the Los Angeles Basin. Wá&#x27;peat was a Desert Serrano village located near what is now the city of Hesperia. It was part of a series of villages located along the Mojave River. By the late 1700s, villages in the area were being increasingly encroached upon by Spanish soldiers and missionaries, who were coming into the region from Mission San Gabriel.

=== Colonial period ===
Spanish Missionaries from Mission San Gabriel Arcángel established a church at the village of Wa&#x27;aachnga, which would be renamed Politania in 1810. Father Francisco Dumetz named the church San Bernardino on May 20, 1810, after the feast day of St. Bernardino of Siena. The Franciscans also gave the name San Bernardino to the snowcapped peak in Southern California, in honor of the saint and it is from him that the county derives its name. In 1819, they established the San Bernardino de Sena Estancia, a mission farm in what is now Redlands.

Following Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, Mexican citizens were granted land grants to establish ranchos in the area of the county. Rancho Jurupa in 1838, Rancho Cucamonga and El Rincon in 1839, Rancho Santa Ana del Chino in 1841, Rancho San Bernardino in 1842 and Rancho Muscupiabe in 1844.

Agua Mansa was the first town in what became San Bernardino County, settled by immigrants from New Mexico on land donated from the Rancho Jurupa in 1841.

=== Establishment ===
Following the purchase of Rancho San Bernardino, and the establishment of the town of San Bernardino in 1851 by Mormon colonists, San Bernardino County was formed in 1853 from parts of Los Angeles County. Some of the southern parts of the county&#x27;s territory were given to Riverside County in 1893.
==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water. It is the largest county by area in California and the largest in the United States (excluding boroughs in Alaska). It is slightly larger than the states of New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island combined, and is also slightly larger than Switzerland. It borders both Nevada and Arizona.

The bulk of the population, nearly two million, live in the roughly 480 square miles south of the San Bernardino Mountains adjacent to Riverside and in the San Bernardino Valley in the southwestern portion of the county. About 390,000 residents live just north of the San Bernardino Mountains, in and around the roughly 280 square-mile area that includes the Victor Valley. Roughly another 100,000 people live scattered across the rest of the sprawling county.

The Mojave National Preserve covers some of the eastern desert, especially between Interstate 15 and Interstate 40. The desert portion also includes the cities of Needles next to the Colorado River and Barstow at the junction of Interstate 15 and Interstate 40. Trona is at the northwestern part of the county, west of Death Valley. This national park, mostly within Inyo County, also has a small portion of land within San Bernardino County. The largest metropolitan area in the Mojave Desert part of the county is the Victor Valley, with the incorporated localities of Adelanto, Apple Valley, Hesperia, and Victorville. Further south, a portion of Joshua Tree National Park overlaps the county near the High Desert area, in the vicinity of Twentynine Palms. The remaining towns make up the remainder of the High Desert: Pioneertown, Yucca Valley, Joshua Tree, Landers, and Morongo Valley.

The mountains are home to the San Bernardino National Forest, and include the communities of Crestline, Lake Arrowhead, Running Springs, Big Bear City, Forest Falls, and Big Bear Lake.

The San Bernardino Valley is at the eastern end of the San Gabriel Valley. The San Bernardino Valley includes the cities of Ontario, Chino, Chino Hills, Upland, Fontana, Rialto, Colton, Grand Terrace, Montclair, Rancho Cucamonga, San Bernardino, Loma Linda, Highland, Redlands, and Yucaipa.

==Politics==

San Bernardino County is a county in which candidates from both major political parties have won in recent elections. Republican Donald Trump carried the county in 2024, flipping it for the first time in a presidential race since 2004. In past presidential elections, Democrat Joe Biden carried the county by a majority and by double digits as well as Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Democratic Party also carried the county in 2008 and 2012, when Barack Obama won majorities of the county&#x27;s votes, and in 1992 and 1996, when Bill Clinton won pluralities. Republican George W. Bush took the county in 2000 by a plurality and in 2004 by a majority. The county is split between heavily Latino, middle-class, and Democratic areas and wealthier conservative areas. The heavily Latino cities of Ontario and San Bernardino went for John Kerry in 2004 but with a relatively low voter turnout. In 2006, San Bernardino&#x27;s population exceeded 201,000, and in 2004, only 42,520 votes were cast in the city; that same year, strongly Republican Rancho Cucamonga had over 145,000 residents, of whom 53,054 voted.

In the 1980s, Northern San Bernardino County proposed to create Mojave County due to the abysmal service levels the county provided. Ultimately, the vote for county secession failed. The proposed county was from the Cajon Pass to the city of Needles.

In 1998, County administrator James Hlawek resigned after being subject to an FBI investigation for bribery, but only after Harry Mays, county Treasurer-Tax Collector Thomas O&#x27;Donnell, County Investment Officer Sol Levin and three businessmen had agreed to plead guilty to federal bribery charges.

In 2004, County Supervisor Geral Eaves Pleaded guilty to bribery for accepting gifts from businesses for allowing billboards on county land.

On November 4, 2008, San Bernardino County voted 67% for Proposition 8, which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriages.

From 2004 to 2016, the county was embroiled in a corruption scandal over the Colonies housing development in Upland with real estate developer Jeff Burum. The scandal resulted in $102 million being paid to Burum&#x27;s real estate company. Supervisor Bill Postmus pleaded guilty to 10 felonies in regard to his previous post as county assessor. In 2020, Burum sued the county again and the county reached for a $69 million settlement. 2022, the county&#x27;s insurance company, Ironside, balked at paying the settlement, claiming that the county willfully &quot;retaliate[d] against the Colonies II Plaintiffs as part of a decades-long dispute over land and water rights in Upland, California, culminating in a malicious prosecution of Burum.&quot;

In 2020, voters approved Measure K, which limited county supervisors to one term instead of three, while reducing pay from 250 thousand dollars to 60 thousand dollars. County Supervisors appealed the decision, only to lose in the state&#x27;s appeals court. By 2022, term limits were restored and pay was restored to 80% of the annual base compensation for San Bernardino Superior Court judges under a supervisor lead ballot measure.

In 2022, The Board of supervisors were pushed by a major supervisor campaign contributor Jeff Burum to vote for secession from the State of California to form the state of Empire. A referendum in 2022 requesting the county board seek a &quot;fair share&quot; of government funding, by means including secession, narrowly passed.

In 2023, San Bernardino County Chief Executive Officer Leonard X. Hernandez resigned, claiming urgent family health issues, after being accused of having an affair with a county employee. After the accustation came out, the county placed Hernandez on Leave. After Hernandez resigned, Hernandez still got paid for one year after his departure.

==Environmental quality==

California Attorney General Jerry Brown sued the county in April 2007 under the state&#x27;s environmental quality act for failing to account for the impact of global warming in the county&#x27;s 25-year growth plan, approved in March. The Center for Biological Diversity, the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society also sued in a separate case. According to Brendan Cummings, a senior attorney for the plaintiffs: &quot;San Bernardino has never seen a project it didn&#x27;t like. They rubber-stamp development. It&#x27;s very much of a frontier mentality.&quot; The plaintiffs want the county to rewrite its growth plan&#x27;s environmental impact statement to include methods to measure greenhouse gases and take steps to reduce them.

According to county spokesman David Wert, only 15% of the county is controlled by the county; the rest is cities and federal and state land. However, the county says it will make sure employment centers and housing are near transportation corridors to reduce traffic and do more to promote compact development and mass transit. The county budgeted $325,000 to fight the lawsuit.

The state and the county reached a settlement in August 2007. The county agreed to amend its general plan to include a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan, including an emission inventory and reduction targets. According to the LA Times in 2015, San Bernardino County had the highest levels of ozone in the United States, averaging 102 parts per billion.

<text>Anarcho-punk (also known as anarchist punk or peace punk) is an ideological subgenre of punk rock that promotes anarchism. Some use the term broadly to refer to any punk music with anarchist lyrical content, which may figure in crust punk, hardcore punk, folk punk, and other styles.

== History ==
=== Before 1977 ===
Some members of the 1960s protopunk bands such as the MC5, The Fugs, Hawkwind, and the Edgar Broughton Band had new left or anarchist ideology. These bands set a precedent for mixing radical politics with rock music and established the idea of rock as an agent of social and political change in the public consciousness. Other precursors to anarcho-punk include avant-garde art and political movements such as Fluxus, Dada, the Beat generation, England&#x27;s angry young men (such as Joe Orton), the surrealism-inspired Situationist International, the May 1968 uprising in Paris, and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys has cited the Yippies as an influence on his activism and thinking.

=== Post 1977 ===
A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred during the 1970s in the United Kingdom following the birth of punk rock, in particular the Situationist-influenced graphics of Sex Pistols artist Jamie Reid, as well as that band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;. Crass and the Poison Girls funded the rented Wapping Autonomy Centre with a benefit single and this then inspired other squatted self-managed social centres in London such as the Ambulance Station on Old Kent Road, Centro Iberico, Molly&#x27;s Café on Upper Street and the Bingo Hall opposite Highbury &amp; Islington station (now the Garage). The concept (and aesthetics) of anarcho-punk was quickly picked up on by bands like Flux of Pink Indians, Subhumans and Conflict.

The early 1980s saw the emergence of the Leeds anarcho-punk scene with groups like Abrasive Wheels, The Expelled and Icon A.D. From this scene came Chumbawamba, whose emphasis on confrontational political activism soon overtook their connection to the scene. Despite their anti-corporate views, the group signed to EMI, leading to their 1997 single &quot;Tubthumping&quot; reaching number 2 on the UK Singles Chart.

Pioneering crust punk bands Antisect, Anti System, Sacrilege and Amebix all began in the anarcho-punk scene, before incorporating their anarchist lyrical themes with elements of early heavy metal. Early British grindcore bands like Carcass, Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror were primarily a part of the 1980s anarcho-punk scene, however began embracing elements of extreme metal and American thrashcore.

==== United States ====
Anarcho-punk spread to the United States in the late 1970s with groups like Austin&#x27;s MDC and San Francisco&#x27;s Dead Kennedys. Los Angeles&#x27; Black Flag also embraced anarchists politics between 1982 and 1986, when Henry Rollins was their vocalist. United States anarcho-punk generally supported revolutions in Latin America and anti-Apartheid movements and criticised the Presidency of Ronald Reagan.

In the 1980s, New York City cultivated a thriving anarcho-punk scene. Beginning as a part of the larger New York hardcore scene, bands like Reagan Youth, False Prophets and Heart Attack made use of a similar musical style and mentality to their British counterparts. This scene split from New York hardcore as the decade progressed. Nausea were a key figure in the scene during this period, helping to cultivate a new scene in the city based around politics and squatting.

In the 2000s, American anarcho-punk groups like Anti-Flag and Against Me gained significant mainstream success for the genre.

== Ideology ==

Anarcho-punk bands often disassociated themselves from established anarchist currents like collectivist anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism or anarcho-communism. Because of this, as well as their emphasis on pacifism, the scene was generally independent of the wider anarchist movement at the time. Bands generally supported animal rights, anti-corporatism, labour rights and the anti-war movement.

Anarcho-punks have criticised the flaws of the punk movement and the wider youth culture. Bands like Crass and Dead Kennedys have written songs that attack corporate co-option of the punk subculture, people who are deemed to have sold out, and the violence between punks, skinheads, B-boys, other youth subcultures, and within punk itself. Some anarcho-punks are straight edge, claiming that alcohol, tobacco, drugs and promiscuity are instruments of oppression and are self-destructive because they cloud the mind and wear down a person&#x27;s resistance to other types of oppression. Some also condemn the waste of land, water and resources necessary to grow crops to make alcohol, tobacco and drugs, forfeiting the potential to grow and manufacture food. Some may be straight edge for religious reasons, such as in the case of Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist anarcho-punks (see Anarchism and religion for more background).

Although Crass initially espoused pacifism, this is not necessarily the case for all anarcho-punks. Despite the broader punk subculture&#x27;s antagonism towards hippies, the ideals of the hippie counterculture were an influence on anarcho-punk. Crass were explicit regarding their associations with the hippie counterculture, and this influence has also carried over to crust punk.

=== Direct action ===
Anarcho-punks universally believe in direct action, although the way in which this manifests itself varies greatly. Despite their differences in strategy, anarcho-punks often co-operate with each other. Many anarcho-punks are pacifists (e.g. Crass and Discharge) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include nonviolent resistance, refusal of work, squatting, economic sabotage, dumpster diving, graffiti, culture jamming, ecotage, freeganism, boycotting, civil disobedience, hacktivism and subvertising. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. Conflict). This manifests itself as rioting, vandalism, wire cutting, hunt sabotage, participation in Animal Liberation Front, Earth Liberation Front, or even Black Bloc style activities, and in extreme cases, bombings. Many anarchists dispute the applicability of the term &quot;violence&quot; to describe destruction of property, since they argue that destruction of property is done not to control an individual or institution but to take its control away.

=== DIY punk ethic ===
Many anarcho-punk bands subscribe to a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; (DIY) ethic. A popular anarcho-punk slogan is &quot;DIY not EMI,&quot; a conscious rejection of a major record company. Many anarcho-punk bands were showcased on the &quot;Bullshit Detector&quot; series of LPs released by Crass Records and Resistance Productions between 1980 and 1994. Some anarcho-punk performers were part of the cassette culture. This allowed artists to bypass the traditional recording and distribution routes, with recordings often being made available in exchange for a blank tape and a self-addressed envelope. The anarcho-punk movement has its own network of fanzines, punk zines, and self-published books which disseminate news, ideas and artwork from the scene. These are DIY productions, tending to be produced in runs of hundreds at most. The &#x27;zines are printed on photocopiers or duplicator machines, and distributed by hand at punk concerts, in radical bookstores and infoshops, and through the mail.

== Musical style and aesthetics ==
Anarcho-punk bands are often less focused on particular musical delivery and more focused on a totalised aesthetic that encompasses the entire creative process, from album and concert art, to political message, and to the lifestyles of the band members. Crass listed as band members the people who did their album art and live visuals. The message is considered to be more important than the music. According to the punk aesthetic, one can express oneself and produce moving and serious works with limited means and technical ability. It is not uncommon for anarcho-punk songs to lack the usual rock structure of verses and a chorus, however, there are exceptions to this. For example, later Chumbawamba songs were at the same time anarcho-punk and pop-oriented.

Bands such as Crass, Conflict, Nausea and Chumbawamba make use of both male and female vocalists.

<text>Jeeves (born Reginald Jeeves, nicknamed Reggie) is a fictional character in a series of comedic short stories and novels by English author P. G. Wodehouse. Jeeves is the highly competent valet of a wealthy and idle young Londoner named Bertie Wooster. First appearing in print in 1915, Jeeves continued to feature in Wodehouse&#x27;s work until his last completed novel &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot; in 1974, a span of 60 years.

Both the name &quot;Jeeves&quot; and the character of Jeeves have come to be thought of as the quintessential name and nature of a manservant, inspiring many similar characters as well as the name of an Internet search engine, Ask Jeeves, and a financial-technology company. A &quot;Jeeves&quot; is now a generic term as validated by its entry in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

Jeeves is a valet, not a butler; that is, he is responsible for serving an individual, whereas a butler is responsible for a household and manages other servants. On rare occasions he does fill in for someone else&#x27;s butler. According to Bertie Wooster, he &quot;can with the best of them&quot;.

== Inspiration ==
A valet called Jevons appears in Wodehouse&#x27;s 1914 short story &quot;Creatures of Impulse&quot;, and may have been an early prototype for Jeeves. Like Jeeves, Jevons is described as the perfect valet. &quot;Creatures of Impulse&quot; appeared in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, and was not republished in any collection, though some parts went into the making of &quot;The Crime Wave at Blandings&quot;.

In his 1953 semi-autobiographical book written with Guy Bolton, &quot;Bring on the Girls!&quot;, Wodehouse suggested that the Jeeves character was inspired by an actual butler named Eugene Robinson whom Wodehouse employed for research purposes. Wodehouse described Robinson as a &quot;walking &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;&quot;. However, Robinson worked at Wodehouse&#x27;s house in Norfolk Street where Wodehouse did not live until 1927, long after Jeeves had been created.

Wodehouse named his Jeeves after Percy Jeeves (1888–1916), a popular English cricketer for Warwickshire. Wodehouse witnessed Percy Jeeves bowling at Cheltenham Cricket Festival in 1913. Percy Jeeves was killed at the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, less than a year after the first appearance of the Wodehouse character who would make his name a household word.

In a letter written in 1965, Wodehouse wrote that he had read Harry Leon Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot; when it was first published as a magazine serial in 1914 and it influenced the creation of Jeeves. &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot; is a comedic novel about an English valet who is won by an American from an English earl in a poker game. In the letter, Wodehouse wrote, &quot;I felt that an English valet would never have been so docile about being handed over to an American in payment of a poker debt. I thought he had missed the chap&#x27;s dignity. I think it was then that the idea of Jeeves came into my mind.&quot;

The development of Jeeves and Bertie was influenced by Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories, according to Richard Usborne; Sherlock Holmes and Jeeves are &quot;the great brains&quot; while Dr. Watson and Bertie are &quot;the awed companion-narrators, bungling things if they try to solve the problems themselves&quot;. Jeeves and Bertie have been described as comic versions of Holmes and Watson. Wodehouse directly compares Jeeves and Bertie to Holmes and Watson in some of the Jeeves stories, such as in &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;.

== Fictional biography ==

=== Early life and family ===
Wodehouse disclosed little about Jeeves&#x27;s early life. According to the character, he was privately educated, and his mother thought him intelligent.

Jeeves has an uncle, Charlie Silversmith, who is butler at Deverill Hall. Silversmith dandled Jeeves on his knee frequently when Jeeves was very young and, when Jeeves is an adult, they write regularly to each other. Charlie Silversmith&#x27;s daughter Queenie Silversmith is Jeeves&#x27;s cousin. Jeeves also mentions his late uncle Cyril in &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;. His niece Mabel is engaged to Bertie Wooster&#x27;s friend Charles &quot;Biffy&quot; Biffen. His cousin Egbert is a constable and plays a role in the short story &quot;Without the Option&quot;.

Jeeves has three placid aunts, in contrast to Bertie Wooster&#x27;s aunts. Aunt Emily is interested in psychical research, and another aunt, Mrs. Pigott, owns a cat in Maiden Eggesford; this cat plays a major role in &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;. Jeeves occasionally refers to an aunt without naming her, including one who read Oliver Wendell Holmes to him when he was young. In &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;, he mentions his Aunt Annie, though she was widely disliked.

=== Employment history ===

In his youth, Jeeves worked as a page boy at a girls&#x27; school. He apparently served in the military to some extent in World War I. In the play &quot;Come On, Jeeves&quot;, Jeeves states that he was a batman.

Shortly before entering Bertie&#x27;s service, Jeeves was employed by Lord Frederick Ranelagh, who was swindled in Monte Carlo. Jeeves previously worked for Lord Worplesdon, resigning after nearly a year because of Worplesdon&#x27;s eccentric choice of evening dress. Jeeves later helps Lord Worplesdon in &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;. Other former employers include Mr. Digby Thistleton (later Lord Bridgnorth), who sold hair tonic; Mr. Montague-Todd, a financier who is in the second year of a prison term when Jeeves mentions him; and Lord Brancaster, who gave port-soaked seedcake to his pet parrot.

Jeeves becomes Bertie Wooster&#x27;s valet. However, his tenure with Bertie Wooster has occasional lapses during the stories; at these times, Jeeves finds work elsewhere. Jeeves works for Lord Chuffnell for a week in &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;, after giving notice because of Bertie Wooster&#x27;s unwillingness to give up the banjolele, and is briefly employed by J. Washburn Stoker in the same novel. In &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, he serves as substitute butler for Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia, and later enters Sir Watkyn Bassett&#x27;s employment for a short time as part of a scheme to help Bertie. Jeeves is Lord Rowcester&#x27;s butler for the length of &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;.

While working for Bertie Wooster, he occasionally pretends to be the valet of one of Bertie&#x27;s friends as part of some scheme, though he is still actually Bertie&#x27;s valet. He pretends to be the valet of Bicky Bickersteth in &quot;Jeeves and the Hard-boiled Egg&quot;, Rocky Todd in &quot;The Aunt and the Sluggard&quot;, and Gussie Fink-Nottle when Gussie masquerades as Bertie Wooster in &quot;The Mating Season&quot;. Jeeves acts as a bookmaker&#x27;s clerk in &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;, disguising himself for the role with a check suit and walrus moustache. In the play &quot;Come On, Jeeves&quot;, which has mostly the same plot as &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;, it is mentioned that Jeeves changed his appearance as a bookmaker&#x27;s clerk, though in the play, Jeeves also impersonates a medieval ghost named Lady Agatha, wearing makeup and women&#x27;s medieval clothing to complete the disguise. He pretends to be a broker&#x27;s man in &quot;Jeeves and the Greasy Bird&quot; and Bertie&#x27;s solicitor in &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;. In one instance, he pretends to be Bertie Wooster in a telephone conversation with playwright Percy Gorringe. In &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, he assumes an alias, calling himself Chief Inspector Witherspoon of Scotland Yard. This alias is also mentioned in &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;.

Jeeves is a member of the Junior Ganymede Club, a London club for butlers and valets.

=== The stories ===

Jeeves is first hired by Bertie in &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot; to replace a valet whom Bertie had fired for stealing from him. In this short story, Bertie briefly fires Jeeves after Jeeves, who believes that Bertie would not be happy with his fiancée Florence Craye, takes steps to end Bertie&#x27;s engagement to her. Bertie quickly rehires Jeeves after realizing that Jeeves was right. Thereafter, Jeeves lives with Bertie, usually in their London residence at Berkeley Mansions. Over the course of the short stories and novels, Jeeves helps Bertie, frequently extricating him from unwanted engagements, and also assists Bertie&#x27;s friends and relatives with various dilemmas. Jeeves often has another motive, such as disposing of an item recently acquired by Bertie that Jeeves does not like, for example a bright scarlet cummerbund. He sometimes receives a monetary reward from Bertie and other people he helps in early stories, though this does not occur in later stories.

Bertie and Jeeves experience a variety of adventures in numerous short stories and novels. Aside from changes in his employment status, some events occur that are particularly noteworthy for Jeeves. Jeeves gets engaged twice in &quot;Jeeves in the Springtime&quot;, though he never talks about these fiancées afterwards, and it appears that he does not become engaged again. In the only story Jeeves narrates, &quot;Bertie Changes His Mind&quot;, he opposes Bertie&#x27;s decision to live with his nieces. Jeeves and Bertie visit Deverill Hall, where Jeeves&#x27;s Uncle Charlie is employed as butler, in &quot;The Mating Season&quot;.

In the novel &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;, which is set after World War II, Jeeves temporarily works as Lord Rowcester&#x27;s butler while Bertie is sent to a school where the idle rich learn to fend for themselves. This is the only story in which Jeeves appears without Bertie Wooster. The novel was adapted from the play &quot;Come On, Jeeves&quot;.

Jeeves&#x27;s first name was not revealed until the penultimate novel, &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;. Bertie Wooster learns Jeeves&#x27;s name when he hears another valet greet Jeeves with &quot;Hullo, Reggie.&quot; The readers may have been surprised to learn Jeeves&#x27;s first name, but Bertie was stunned by the revelation &quot;that he had a first name&quot; in the first place. In the club book of Jeeves&#x27;s club, the Junior Ganymede, all members must record the foibles of their employers to forewarn other butlers and valets. Bertie wants Jeeves to destroy his section. Jeeves is initially reluctant to defy his club&#x27;s rules, but he eventually does destroy the pages for Bertie by the end of &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;.

Jeeves last appears in &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;, in which Jeeves and Bertie head to the rural village of Maiden Eggesford, though Jeeves wants to go to New York. He and Bertie visit New York at the end of the story.

== Personal characteristics ==
=== Age and appearance ===

While Bertie Wooster is approximately 24 years old in &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot; (1916), Jeeves&#x27;s age is not stated in the stories, and has been interpreted differently by various illustrators and adaptations. However, there are a few hints in the books regarding Jeeves&#x27;s age. Jeeves has a long employment history, and he is older than Bertie Wooster. On the other hand, Jeeves is young enough to be engaged to a waitress courted by Bingo Little, who is the same age as Bertie Wooster, in &quot;Jeeves in the Springtime&quot;. In &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;, Jeeves is described as resembling &quot;a youngish High Priest of a refined and dignified religion&quot;.

In the reference work &quot;Wodehouse in Woostershire&quot; by Wodehouse scholars Geoffrey Jaggard and Tony Ring, it is speculated using information provided in the Jeeves canon that Bertie&#x27;s age ranges from approximately 24 to 29 over the stories, and that Jeeves is roughly ten years older than Bertie, giving an age range of 35 to 40. This happens to agree with a personal letter Wodehouse wrote in 1961 to scholar Robert A. Hall Jr., in which Wodehouse, explaining that his characters did not age with real life time, gave an approximate age for Jeeves:

Keggs in &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot; is supposed to be the same man who appears in &quot;The Butler Did It&quot;, but does it pan out all right? It doesn&#x27;t if you go by when the books were written. The &quot;Damsel&quot; was published in 1919 and the &quot;Butler&quot; in 1957. But I always ignore real life time. After all, Jeeves—first heard of at the age presumably of about thirty-five in 1916—would now be around eighty-five, counting the real years.

Thompson suggests that the age gap between Bertie and Jeeves is roughly 20 years. According to the stage directions of &quot;Come On, Jeeves,&quot; Jeeves is depicted as being in his mid-forties. Though, it is worth noting the play is set in the 1950s (later adapted into the novel &quot;Ring For Jeeves&quot;), so this indicates the general age Jeeves may appear to be in the non-linear canon, rather than a chronological reference point.

In appearance, Jeeves is described as &quot;tall and dark and impressive&quot;. When they first meet in &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot;, Bertie describes Jeeves as &quot;a kind of darkish sort of respectful Johnnie&quot; with &quot;a grave, sympathetic face&quot; and a nearly silent way of walking that Bertie equates to a &quot;healing zephyr&quot;. On multiple occasions, Bertie states that Jeeves has &quot;finely chiselled features&quot;, and a large head, which seems to Bertie to indicate intelligence. As Bertie says, Jeeves is &quot;a godlike man in a bowler hat with grave, finely chiselled features and a head that stuck out at the back, indicating great brain power&quot;. Bertie also describes Jeeves&#x27;s eyes as gleaming with intelligence.

=== Personality ===

Bertie frequently describes Jeeves as having a &quot;feudal spirit&quot;. Jeeves enjoys helping Bertie and his friends, and solves Bertie&#x27;s personal problems despite not being obliged to do so. Jeeves interrupts his vacation twice to come to Bertie&#x27;s aid (in &quot;The Love That Purifies&quot; and &quot;Jeeves in the Offing&quot;). He regularly rescues Bertie, usually from an unwanted marriage but also from other threats, such as when he saves Bertie from a hostile swan or when he pulls Bertie out of the way of a taxi. Jeeves is evidently offended when a revolutionary tells him that servants are outdated in &quot;Comrade Bingo&quot;.

Jeeves generally manipulates situations for the better and is described as &quot;a kindly man&quot; in &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;. However, he does influence Bertie&#x27;s decisions to suit his own preferences, such as when he causes Bertie to change his mind about living with his nieces in &quot;Bertie Changes His Mind&quot;. Jeeves is also stubborn when opposing a new item that Bertie has taken a liking to, such as an alpine hat or purple socks. While he often stays on in spite of these radical objects, he can only withstand so much: the worst case is when he resigned after Bertie, privately labeling him as a &quot;domestic Mussolini&quot;, resolved to study the banjolele in the countryside. Usually, Jeeves finds a way to help Bertie with a problem, and Bertie agrees to give away the item that Jeeves disapproves of. Even when Bertie and Jeeves are having a disagreement, Jeeves still shows sympathy, as much as he shows any emotion, when Bertie is in serious trouble.

Often wearing &quot;an expression of quiet intelligence combined with a feudal desire to oblige&quot;, Jeeves consistently maintains a calm and courteous demeanor. When he feels discomfort or is being discreet, he assumes an expressionless face which Bertie describes as resembling a &quot;stuffed moose&quot; or &quot;stuffed frog&quot;. When very surprised, he will raise his eyebrow a small fraction of an inch, and when he is amused, the corner of his mouth twitches slightly. His composure extends to his voice, which is soft and respectful. When he wishes to start a conversation, he sometimes makes a low gentle cough &quot;like a very old sheep clearing its throat on a misty mountain top&quot;. He may also cough to signify disapproval. Bertie states that he saw the normally imperturbable Jeeves come &quot;very near to being rattled&quot; for the first time when the sight of Bingo Little in a false beard caused Jeeves to drop his jaw and steady himself with a table in &quot;Comrade Bingo&quot;. In &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;, Bertie claims that the only occasion on which he had ever seen Jeeves &quot;really rattled&quot; was when he first met Bertie&#x27;s friend Boko Fittleworth, who wears turtleneck sweaters and flannel trousers with a patch on the knee; Jeeves &quot;winced visibly and tottered off&quot; to recover his composure in the kitchen, where Bertie supposes Jeeves pulled himself together with cooking sherry.

Bertie says that Jeeves is persuasive and magnetic. He believes that Jeeves could convince a candidate standing for Parliament to vote against herself. There is a poetic side to Jeeves, who recites a great deal of poetry. He is much affected when a parted couple reconciles, and tells Bertie that his heart leaps up when he beholds a rainbow in the sky.

It is not unusual for Bertie&#x27;s acquaintances to ask for Jeeves&#x27;s help directly without discussing it with Bertie, and Jeeves is willing to assist them even if Bertie is not involved in any way. Bertie once says that Jeeves &quot;isn&#x27;t so much a valet as a Mayfair consultant.&quot; On one occasion, Bertie considers it probable that even the distinguished Sir Roderick Glossop has consulted Jeeves, and says, &quot;Jeeves is like Sherlock Holmes. The highest in the land come to him with their problems. For all I know, they may give him jewelled snuff boxes.&quot;

=== Skills ===
Jeeves presents the ideal image of the gentlemanly manservant, being highly competent, dignified, and respectful. He speaks intelligently and correctly, using proper titles for members of the nobility. One of his skills is moving silently and unobtrusively from room to room. According to Bertie, Jeeves noiselessly &quot;floats&quot; and &quot;shimmers&quot;. Bertie once remarks, &quot;Presently I was aware that Jeeves was with me. I hadn&#x27;t heard him come in, but you often don&#x27;t with Jeeves. He just streams silently from spot A to spot B, like some gas&quot;. In addition to being a proficient valet, Jeeves can serve capably as a butler, and does so on a few occasions. As Bertie says in &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, &quot;If the call comes, he can buttle with the best of them.&quot;

Jeeves has an encyclopedic knowledge of literature and academic subjects. He frequently quotes from Shakespeare and the romantic poets. Well informed about members of the British aristocracy thanks to the club book of the Junior Ganymede Club, he also seems to have a considerable number of useful connections among various servants. Jeeves uses his knowledge and connections to solve problems inconspicuously. Richard Usborne, a leading scholar of the life and works of Wodehouse, describes Jeeves as a &quot;godlike prime mover&quot; and &quot;master brain who is found to have engineered the apparent coincidence or coincidences&quot;. To form his plans, Jeeves often studies &quot;the psychology of the individual&quot; or the personality of one or more people involved in the situation. His mental prowess is attributed to eating fish, according to Bertie Wooster, who credits the phosphorus content in the fish with boosting Jeeves&#x27;s brain power. Jeeves does not try to argue this claim, though at least once he says he does not eat a lot of fish.

One of Jeeves&#x27;s greatest skills is making a special drink of his own invention, a strong beverage which momentarily stuns one&#x27;s senses but is very effective in curing hangovers. The drink is Jeeves&#x27;s version of a prairie oyster. Bertie first hires Jeeves after his hangover is cured by one of Jeeves&#x27;s special drinks. Not simply a hangover cure, the drink can also give energy to someone who needs it, yet calm down someone who is agitated. Dark in colour, Jeeves&#x27;s special pick-me-up is composed of Worcester sauce, a raw egg, and red pepper according to Jeeves, though Bertie suspects that the drink consists of more than that. Wodehouse mentions other ingredients in a personal letter he wrote late in his life, though these ingredients are not referred to in the stories. Additionally, Jeeves is capable of typing and writing shorthand.

Jeeves has knowledge in more dubious subjects as well. He is well-informed about how to steal paintings and kidnap dogs. He uses a Mickey Finn to incapacitate the unscrupulous Bingley. Capable of action when the situation calls for it, Jeeves uses a golf club to knock out Sippy Sipperley in &quot;The Inferiority Complex of Old Sippy&quot;, and takes down a swan with a raincoat and boathook in &quot;Jeeves and the Impending Doom&quot;. He finds it necessary to get Aunt Dahlia to knock out Bertie with a gong stick in &quot;Jeeves Makes an Omelette&quot;, though he agrees with Bertie not to use this sort of tactic again. After Jeeves uses a cosh to knock out Constable Dobbs in &quot;The Mating Season&quot;, an astonished Bertie describes Jeeves as &quot;something that would be gratefully accepted as a muscle guy by any gang on the lookout for new blood&quot;.

=== Hobbies ===

Jeeves often reads intellectual, &quot;improving&quot; books, including the works of Spinoza, Shakespeare, and &quot;Dostoevsky and the great Russians&quot;. He also enjoys the works of romance novelist Rosie M. Banks, and regularly reads &quot;The Times&quot;, which Bertie occasionally borrows to try the crossword puzzle. In &quot;Jeeves in the Springtime&quot;, he went dancing in Camberwell, where he was seen by Bertie&#x27;s friend Bingo Little. Bingo says that he saw Jeeves &quot;swinging a dashed efficient shoe&quot;. Once a week, Jeeves takes the afternoon off to play bridge at his club, the Junior Ganymede.

One of Jeeves&#x27;s hobbies is fishing, which he tends to do during his annual summer holiday, typically taken at Bognor Regis. Bertie sees him fishing in &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;. Appreciating travel in general, Jeeves wants to go on a cruise in two different stories, &quot;The Spot of Art&quot; and &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;. Jeeves claims that travel is educational, though Bertie suspects that Jeeves has a Viking strain and &quot;yearns for the tang of the salt breezes&quot;. Jeeves occasionally enjoys gambling, which is the reason he wishes to go to Monte Carlo in &quot;Jeeves and the Yule-tide Spirit&quot;.

== Relationship with Bertie Wooster ==
The premise of the Jeeves stories is that the brilliant valet is firmly in control of his rich and unworldly young employer&#x27;s life. Jeeves becomes Bertie Wooster&#x27;s guardian and all-purpose problem solver, devising subtle plans to help Bertie and his friends with various problems. In particular, Jeeves extricates Bertie Wooster from engagements to formidable women whom Bertie reluctantly becomes engaged to, Bertie being unwilling to hurt a woman&#x27;s feelings by turning her down. While Jeeves wants to keep Bertie from a fiancée whom he believes will not make Bertie happy, Jeeves also wants to keep his position, which he feels would be threatened by a wife. Jeeves also provides assistance when Bertie, who refuses to let a pal down, gets drawn into trouble trying to help a friend or a relative he is fond of. Bertie is usually unaware of the extent of Jeeves&#x27;s machinations until all is revealed at the end of the story. On one occasion, Bertie acknowledges and accepts his role as a pawn in Jeeves&#x27;s grand plan, though Jeeves objects, saying that he could have accomplished nothing without Bertie&#x27;s cooperation.

For the most part, Bertie and Jeeves are on good terms. Being fond of Bertie, Jeeves considers their connection &quot;pleasant in every respect&quot;. Bertie says that he looks on Jeeves as &quot;a sort of guide, philosopher, and friend&quot;. At times when Bertie is separated from Jeeves, Bertie is miserable. When Bertie must stay by himself in a hotel in &quot;The Aunt and the Sluggard&quot;, he struggles without having Jeeves there to press his clothes and bring him tea, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ve felt so rotten. Somehow I found myself moving about the room softly, as if there had been a death in the family&quot;; he later cheers himself up by going round the cabarets, though &quot;the frightful loss of Jeeves made any thought of pleasure more or less a mockery&quot;. In &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;, when Jeeves has left Bertie&#x27;s employment because of their disagreement over a banjolele, Bertie still seeks Jeeves for help and Jeeves comes to his aid. Bertie dislikes when Jeeves goes on his annual holiday, stating, &quot;without this right-hand man at his side Bertram Wooster becomes a mere shadow of his former self&quot;. Jeeves appreciates the praise that Bertie bestows on him, saying that &quot;Mr. Wooster has always been gratifyingly appreciative of my humble efforts on his behalf&quot;.

Jeeves has firm ideas about how an English gentleman should dress and behave, and sees it as his duty to ensure that his employer presents himself appropriately. When friction arises between Jeeves and Bertie, it is usually over some new item about which Bertie Wooster is enthusiastic that does not meet with Jeeves&#x27;s approval, such as bright purple socks, a white mess jacket, or a garish vase. Bertie becomes attached to these less conservative pieces and views Jeeves&#x27;s opposition to them as &quot;hidebound and reactionary&quot;, marking him &quot;an enemy to Progress&quot;. This type of disagreement results in a period of coolness between them. The conflict is resolved by the end of the story, typically after Jeeves has helped Bertie with his latest problem. Bertie, grateful, agrees to have it Jeeves&#x27;s way. He does not object if he learns that Jeeves, foreseeing that Bertie would agree to give up the item, has already disposed of it.

Bertie considers Jeeves to be a marvel, and wonders why Jeeves is content to work for him, stating, &quot;It beats me sometimes why a man with his genius is satisfied to hang around pressing my clothes and what not&quot;. Jeeves has been offered twice the salary Bertie pays him by another gentleman, but still remains with Bertie. Jeeves views Bertie as being friendly but mentally negligible, though his opinion of Bertie&#x27;s intelligence seems to improve over time. In an early story, he says that Bertie is &quot;an exceedingly pleasant and amiable young gentleman, but not intelligent. By no means intelligent. Mentally he is negligible – quite negligible.&quot; Hearing this spurs Bertie to try to solve problems on his own, though he ultimately fails and needs Jeeves&#x27;s assistance. Nonetheless, Jeeves&#x27;s view of Bertie&#x27;s intelligence has apparently softened by the first novel, when Jeeves says that Bertie &quot;is, perhaps, mentally somewhat negligible, but he has a heart of gold&quot;. At one point in the ninth novel, Jeeves actually commends Bertie&#x27;s quick thinking, saying that Bertie&#x27;s tactic of hiding from an antagonist behind a sofa &quot;showed a resource and swiftness of thought which it would be difficult to overpraise&quot;.

== Influence ==
Jeeves&#x27;s name is used as a synonym for a personal manservant. A &quot;&quot; is a generic term for a model valet or butler according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot;. It can mean a &quot;resourceful helper&quot; according to the &quot;Encarta World English Dictionary&quot;. In a comedy routine in a 1993 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode, Jerry Seinfeld said, &quot;Did you ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves? I think when you name a baby Jeeves; you&#x27;ve pretty much mapped out his future. Not much chance he&#x27;s gonna be a hitman.&quot;

From 1996 until 2006, Ask.com, a question-and-answer search engine, was known as Ask Jeeves and featured a caricature of a butler on its launch page. The name of Jeeves has also been used by other companies and services, such as the British dry-cleaning firm Jeeves of Belgravia and the New Zealand company Jeeves Tours.

The fictional amateur detective Lord Peter Wimsey and his valet Mervyn Bunter, created by Dorothy L. Sayers in 1923, were partially inspired by Bertie Wooster and Jeeves.

Jeeves himself is parodied in the mashup &quot;Scream for Jeeves.&quot;

== Jeeves series ==
===List of stories===
The Jeeves canon is a series of comedic stories following Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves, consisting of 35 short stories and 11 novels. With minor exceptions, the short stories were written and published first (between 1915 and 1930); the novels later (between 1934 and 1974). While the series of stories featuring the character of Jeeves are often referred to as the &quot;Jeeves&quot; stories, the series is also called by other names such as the &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; or &quot;Jeeves and Bertie&quot; stories.

Bertie Wooster narrates (in the first person) all the stories but two, &quot;Bertie Changes His Mind&quot; (which Jeeves himself narrates in the first person), and &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot; (which features Jeeves but not Bertie Wooster and is written in the third person).

Jeeves and Bertie first appeared in &quot;Extricating Young Gussie&quot;, a short story published in the US in September 1915, though it was not seen in the UK until 1916. In the story, Jeeves&#x27;s character is minor and not fully developed, and Bertie&#x27;s surname appears to be Mannering-Phipps. The first fully recognisable Jeeves and Wooster story was &quot;Leave It to Jeeves&quot;, published in early 1916. As the series progressed, Jeeves assumed the role of Bertie Wooster&#x27;s co-protagonist. Most of the Jeeves stories were originally published as magazine pieces before being collected into books, although 11 of the short stories were reworked and divided into 18 chapters to make an episodic semi-novel called &quot;The Inimitable Jeeves&quot;.

The collection &quot;The World of Jeeves&quot; (first published in 1967, reprinted in 1988) contains all of the Jeeves short stories (with the exception of &quot;Extricating Young Gussie&quot;) presented more or less in narrative chronological order, with a new introduction by Wodehouse. This collection includes the original versions of the eleven stories that were somewhat altered by Wodehouse to create the episodic novel &quot;The Inimitable Jeeves&quot;.

===Setting and timeline===

The short stories are set primarily in London, where Bertie Wooster has a flat and is a member of the raucous Drones Club, or in New York City, though some short stories are set around various stately homes in the English countryside. The novels all take place at or near an English country house, most commonly Brinkley Court, Worcestershire (in four novels) and Totleigh Towers, Gloucestershire (in two novels).

The Jeeves stories are described as occurring within a few years of each other. For example, Bertie states in &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot; (1954) that his Aunt Dahlia has been running her paper &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot;, first introduced in &quot;Clustering Round Young Bingo&quot; (1925), for about three years. However, there are inconsistencies between the stories that make it difficult to construct a timeline. For instance, it is stated in &quot;Jeeves in the Offing&quot; that Aunt Dahlia ran her paper for four years, and not three, as is shown in &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot;. Nonetheless, some scholars have attempted to create a rough timeline. J. H. C. Morris suggested that the Jeeves canon spanned approximately five years, stating that four Christmases are accounted for, and another must have passed during Bertie&#x27;s time in America in the early stories, making five in all. Kristin Thompson also suggested that approximately five years passed during the stories, though Thompson instead relied on explicit references to time passed between events in the series.

The stories follow a floating timeline, with each story being set at the time it was written, while the characters do not change and past events are referred to as happening recently. This results in the stories following &quot;two kinds of time&quot;, as the characters hardly age but are seen against the background of a changing world. This floating timeline allows for comedic references to films, songs, and politicians that would have been well known to readers when the stories were written. For example, in &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot; (1954), when Bertie is surprised to hear that his Aunt Dahlia wants to sell her weekly paper, he remarks, &quot;It was like hearing that Rodgers had decided to sell Hammerstein.&quot; (This is a reference to Rodgers and Hammerstein, who created popular Broadway musicals in the 1940s and 1950s.) 
Similarly, &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot; (1974) mentions evangelist Billy Graham, who did not become a public figure until the late 1940s. However, certain Edwardian era elements, such as aristocratic country houses and traditional gentlemen&#x27;s clubs like the Drones Club, continue to be prevalent throughout the series, despite becoming less common in the real world. Several writers have described the Jeeves series as being set in the interwar period (1918–1939).

The setting is generally an idealised version of the world, with international conflicts being downplayed or ignored. Illness and injuries cause negligible harm, similar to downplayed injuries in stage comedy.

===Comic style===
The plots and dialogue of the Jeeves stories were strongly influenced by Wodehouse&#x27;s experience writing for the stage, and the playlike quality of the stories is often comically exaggerated. For example, many stage comedies involve two sundered couples, and this number is increased to five for the plot of the Jeeves novel &quot;The Mating Season&quot;. Bertie frequently uses theatrical terminology to describe characters and settings. For instance, in &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;, Bertie says that Lord Worplesdon&#x27;s study &quot;proved to be what they call on the stage a &#x27;rich interior&#x27;, liberally equipped with desks, chairs, tables, carpets and all the usual fixings.&quot; Later in the same scene, when Worplesdon sends his butler to fetch Jeeves, Bertie says, &quot;During the stage wait, which was not of long duration, the old relative filled in with some &quot;ad lib&quot; stuff about Boko, mostly about how much he disliked his face&quot; (chapter 22). The dialogue is sometimes written like in a script. For example, several lines of text in the first chapter of &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; are rendered in script format.

Wodehouse uses a number of what Kristin Thompson terms &quot;delaying devices&quot; to keep the competent Jeeves from solving problems too quickly. For example, Bertie sometimes cannot get help from Jeeves initially because Jeeves is away on vacation. In multiple stories, Jeeves delays solving Bertie&#x27;s problem because he disapproves of an object Bertie has acquired. Jeeves is shown to be a &quot;thoroughly pragmatic, occasionally Machiavellian figure&quot; who is willing to delay solving problems until it is advantageous for him to do so. In some stories, Bertie insists on trying to handle problems himself. Jeeves, planning in the background, can estimate the extent of Bertie&#x27;s mistakes in advance and incorporate them into his own plan in the end.

Wodehouse has Jeeves consistently use a very formal manner of speaking, while Bertie&#x27;s speech mixes formal and informal language. These different styles are frequently used to create humour in the stories, such as when Bertie has to translate Jeeves&#x27;s erudite speech for one of his pals who is not familiar with Jeeves. An example of this occurs in &quot;The Artistic Career of Corky&quot;, when Jeeves comes up with a plan to help Bertie&#x27;s friend Corky. Jeeves says his plan &quot;cannot fail of success&quot; but has a drawback in that it &quot;requires a certain financial outlay&quot;. Bertie explains to Corky that Jeeves means &quot;he has got a pippin of an idea, but it&#x27;s going to cost a bit&quot;.

Jeeves often tells Bertie about his machinations at the end of the stories, but does not always reveal everything to Bertie. This can be seen in the only story narrated by Jeeves, &quot;Bertie Changes His Mind&quot;, in which Jeeves manipulates events without telling Bertie. The reader can infer some of Jeeves&#x27;s offstage activity from subtle clues in Bertie&#x27;s narrative. For example, in &quot;Jeeves and the Kid Clementina&quot;, Bertie ends up in a tree while trespassing as part of a task outlined by the mischievous Bobbie Wickham, and is confronted by a policeman. The only information given to the reader about how the policeman got there is when he says, &quot;We had a telephone call at the station saying there was somebody in Miss Mapleton&#x27;s garden.&quot; After reading the story, the reader can look back and infer that Jeeves called the police himself or got someone else to do it, knowing the incident would ultimately make Bertie seem heroic to Miss Mapleton and would make Bertie realize the dangers of Bobbie&#x27;s scheming.

== Adaptations ==

=== Television ===

* &quot;The World of Wooster&quot; (30 May 1965 to 17 November 1967, 20 episodes of 30 minutes) was a half-hour comedy series for BBC1, with Dennis Price as Jeeves, and Ian Carmichael as Bertie Wooster.
* In the 1970s and 1980s, Jeeves and Bertie Wooster were portrayed by various actors in twelve commercials for Croft Original Sherry. One 1973 advertisement featured Jeremy Irons as Bertie Wooster.
* In the 1981 BBC Two documentary &quot;Thank You, P. G. Wodehouse&quot;, Jeeves was portrayed by Michael Aldridge and Bertie Wooster was portrayed by Jonathan Cecil.

The scripts for this series by Clive Exton have been praised for their fidelity to Wodehouse&#x27;s original vision although there are some departures from the stories, including the use of Hugh Laurie&#x27;s ability to sing and play boogie woogie piano to have Bertie perform such songs accompanied by Jeeves.

=== Film ===
* In 1919, two silent short comedy films, &quot;Making Good with Mother&quot; and &quot;Cutting Out Venus&quot;, were released in the US. These shorts were inspired by the Reggie Pepper stories and directed by Lawrence C. Windom. Reggie Pepper, a prototype for Bertie Wooster, was given a manservant named &quot;Jeeves&quot; who was a reformed burglar. The shorts featured Lawrence Grossmith as Reggie Pepper and Charles Coleman as Jeeves.
* &quot;Thank You, Jeeves!&quot; (1936) was the first film to feature Jeeves and Bertie, with Arthur Treacher as Jeeves and David Niven as Bertie Wooster. In the film, they meet a girl and help her brother stop two spies trying to get his secret plans. The film has almost nothing to do with the book of that title, and Jeeves is portrayed as unhelpful and pompous. &quot;Step Lively, Jeeves!&quot; (1937) also featured Arthur Treacher as Jeeves, who is swindled into pursuing a phony inheritance. Bertie Wooster does not appear, Jeeves is portrayed as a naive bumbler, and the film has nothing to do with any Wodehouse story. Wodehouse was very unhappy with the two Treacher films and did not encourage continuation of the series.
* &quot;By Jeeves&quot; (2001) is a recorded performance of the musical, released as a video with British actor Martin Jarvis as Jeeves and American actor John Scherer as Bertie Wooster.

=== Radio ===
* &quot;Leave It to Jeeves&quot; (1940) is an episode of the American CBS radio series &quot;Forecast&quot;. It was not based on the Wodehouse short story originally titled &quot;Leave it to Jeeves&quot;. Alan Mowbray portrayed Jeeves and Edward Everett Horton portrayed Bertie Wooster. The scriptwriter was Stuart Palmer.
* In the 1955 BBC Light Programme dramatisation of the novel &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;, Deryck Guyler portrayed Jeeves and Ian Carmichael portrayed Bill, Lord Rowcester. In the following 1956 dramatisation of &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;, Deryck Guyler again portrayed Jeeves, and Naunton Wayne portrayed Bertie Wooster.
* &quot;Jeeves&quot; is a 1958 LP record issued by Caedmon with Terry-Thomas as Bertie Wooster and Roger Livesey as Jeeves. Side one is the story &quot;Indian Summer of an Uncle&quot;; side two is &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot;. The album was re-released by Harper Audio in 1989.
* &quot;What Ho! Jeeves&quot; (1973 to 1981) is a BBC Radio 4 series adapting various Jeeves stories with Michael Hordern as Jeeves, and Richard Briers as Bertie Wooster.
* In 1988, David Suchet portrayed Jeeves and Simon Cadell played Bertie Wooster in the BBC &quot;Saturday Night Theatre&quot; radio adaptation of the novel &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;.
* In 1997, L.A. Theatre Works dramatised &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, with Martin Jarvis as Jeeves (and Roderick Spode) and Mark Richard as Bertie Wooster. In 1998, the same organisation dramatised &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;, with Paxton Whitehead as Jeeves and Simon Templeman as Bertie Wooster. Both dramatisations were adapted by Richard, who had previously adapted the novels as theatrical plays, and were recorded before a live audience.
* In 2006, BBC Radio 4 dramatised &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; for its &quot;Classic Serial&quot; series, with Andrew Sachs as Jeeves and Marcus Brigstocke as Bertie Wooster.
* &quot;Jeeves Live!&quot; (2007—2020) is an intermittent series of dramatic readings of Jeeves short stories, performed by Martin Jarvis in front of a live audience and broadcast on BBC Radio 4. The series includes the following eight stories: &quot;Fixing It for Freddie&quot;, &quot;Bertie Changes His Mind&quot;, &quot;Jeeves and the Song of Songs&quot;, &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot;, &quot;The Aunt and the Sluggard&quot;, &quot;Jeeves and the Yule-Tide Spirit&quot;, &quot;Indian Summer of an Uncle&quot;, and &quot;The Great Sermon Handicap&quot;. Two other stories aired under the title &quot;Jeeves in Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest&quot; and &quot;The Artistic Career of Corky&quot;. Six of these readings were recorded live at the Cheltenham Literature Festival.
* In 2014, Martin Jarvis portrayed Jeeves and Jamie Bamber portrayed Bill, Lord Rowcester, in a radio drama adapting &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot; for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Classic Serial&quot; series.
* In 2018, &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot; was adapted as a radio drama for BBC Radio 4. Martin Jarvis portrayed Jeeves and James Callis portrayed Bertie Wooster.

=== Theatre ===
* &quot;Come On, Jeeves&quot; (opened 1954, still presented from time to time under its name or as &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;) is a 1952 play by Guy Bolton and Wodehouse (adapted into the 1953 novel &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;), opened 1954 in Worthing, England (cast unknown), published in 1956.
* The Jeeves novel &quot;The Mating Season&quot; was dramatized as a play by Marjorie Duhan Adler, under the title &quot;Too Much Springtime&quot;. The play was published by the Dramatic Publishing Company in Chicago in 1955.
* The original theatre production of &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot; starring Edward Duke was co-devised by James and Edward Duke with Hugh Wooldridge in 1980. Wooldridge also directed and lit this world premiere production at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. A brand new production of &quot;Jeeves Takes Charge&quot; with Sam Harrison opens at the Theatre Royal, Bath, in December 2024, again directed by Hugh Wooldridge.
* Mark Richard dramatised multiple Jeeves novels for the stage: &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; (premiered 1993), &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; (1994), &quot;Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit&quot; (1995), &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot; (1996), and &quot;Jeeves in the Morning&quot; (1997). Richard portrayed Bertie Wooster in these productions, with Page Hearn as Jeeves. They reprised their roles for Hearn&#x27;s dramatisation of a Jeeves novel, &quot;Jeeves and the Mating Season&quot; (2001). These productions were presented by the City Lit Theater Company in Chicago. Richard adapted the scripts of &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; and &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot; for L.A. Theatre Works radio productions.
* Playwright Margaret Raether has adapted five plays from the Jeeves stories which have been presented at multiple theatres in the United States. The plays are: &quot;Jeeves Intervenes&quot; (premiered 2006), &quot;Jeeves in Bloom&quot; (2009), &quot;Jeeves Takes a Bow&quot; (2012), &quot;Jeeves at Sea&quot; (2015), and &quot;Jeeves Saves the Day&quot; (2020). &quot;Jeeves Intervenes&quot; is loosely based on &quot;Jeeves and the Hard-boiled Egg&quot;, and &quot;Jeeves in Bloom&quot; on &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;. The plot of &quot;Jeeves Takes a Bow&quot; involves a friend of Bertie&#x27;s who takes an interest in performing on the stage (a plot point used in &quot;Extricating Young Gussie&quot; and &quot;Jeeves and the Chump Cyril&quot;), and in &quot;Jeeves at Sea&quot;, another friend of Bertie&#x27;s pretends to be his own twin brother (in circumstances similar to those in Wodehouse&#x27;s Reggie Pepper story &quot;Rallying Round Old George&quot;).
* &quot;Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense&quot;, a play based on the novel &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, premiered in 2013 with Matthew Macfadyen as Jeeves and Stephen Mangan as Bertie Wooster.

=== Musicals ===
* &quot;Jeeves&quot; (22 April 1975 to 24 May 1975, 38 performances), an unsuccessful musical loosely based on Wodehouse, opened in London (with Michael Aldridge as Jeeves, and David Hemmings as Bertie Wooster). Music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, lyrics and book by Alan Ayckbourn, based on the novel &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;.
* &quot;By Jeeves&quot; (1 May 1996 to 12 February 1997; 28 October 2001 to 30 December 2001, 73 performances), a more successful complete rewrite of the earlier version, opened in London (with Malcolm Sinclair as Jeeves, and Steven Pacey as Wooster), and premiered in the US in November 1996 (with Richard Kline as Jeeves, and John Scherer as Wooster). It was produced again in 2001 on Broadway (with Martin Jarvis as Jeeves, and Scherer as Wooster), with one recorded performance released as a video film and aired on television.

=== Comics ===
* In Alan Moore&#x27;s comic &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot; (2007), Jeeves appears in the segment &quot;What Ho, Gods of the Abyss?&quot; in which he contacts the League through a cousin in the British Museum to help combat the arrival of a Mi-go to Brinkley Court and Bertie Wooster&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia&#x27;s possession by Cthulhu. 
* The Japanese manga series &quot;Please, Jeeves&quot; (2008–2014) adapts many of the Jeeves short stories. It was translated by Tamaki Morimura and illustrated by Bun Katsuta.

=== Literature ===
* The short story &quot;Clubs are Trumps&quot; was written by Hugh Kingsmill as a sequel to the Jeeves story &quot;The Purity of the Turf&quot;. It was published in 1931 in an issue of &quot;The English Review&quot;, and reprinted in &quot;The Best of Hugh Kingsmill&quot;, published in 1970 by Victor Gollancz, London.
* In the 20 May 1953 issue of &quot;Punch&quot;, writer Julian Maclaren-Ross wrote a parody of the Jeeves stories titled &quot;Good Lord, Jeeves&quot;. In the story, Bertie loses his wealth and needs a job; Jeeves, who has just been elevated to the peerage, hires Bertie as his valet. Wodehouse wrote to Maclaren-Ross saying how much he liked it. It was included in Maclaren-Ross&#x27;s book &quot;The Funny Bone&quot;, published in 1956 by Elek, London.
* In the 1970s and 1980s, Jeeves and Bertie Wooster were featured in a number of full-page magazine print advertisements for Croft Original Sherry. The advertisements each had comedic prose imitating Wodehouse&#x27;s writing style and a colour illustration similar to the magazine illustrations that originally appeared with many of Wodehouse&#x27;s stories.
* &quot;Jeeves: A Gentleman&#x27;s Personal Gentleman&quot; (1981), a fictional biography of Jeeves by Northcote Parkinson, attempts to provide background information about him.
* &quot;Scream for Jeeves&quot; (1990) was written under the pseudonym H. P. G. Wodecraft (actually Peter Cannon) and published in &quot;Crypt of Cthulhu&quot; #72. It purports to put Jeeves and Bertie Wooster into the action of Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot;. It was later included in &quot;Scream for Jeeves: A Parody&quot; (1994), which contains two more Lovecraft fusions, titled &quot;Something Foetid&quot; and &quot;The Rummy Affair of Young Charlie&quot;. 
* &quot;Wake Up, Sir!&quot; (2005) by Jonathan Ames is a homage to the Bertie and Jeeves novels.
* &quot;Jeeves and the Wedding Bells&quot; (2013), a pastiche novel authorized by the Wodehouse estate, was written by British novelist Sebastian Faulks, who became the first writer authorized by the Wodehouse estate to produce a new fiction utilizing the Jeeves and Wooster characters.
* The short story &quot;Greeves and the Evening Star&quot; by Matt Hughes, published in the 2015 anthology &quot;Old Venus&quot;, is a science fiction parody of Jeeves and Wooster that takes place on the planet Venus. The characters based on Jeeves and Bertie Wooster are renamed Greeves and Bartie Gloster.
* &quot;Jeeves and the King of Clubs&quot; (2018), a pastiche novel authorized by the Wodehouse estate, was written by Ben Schott. A sequel by Schott titled &quot;Jeeves and the Leap of Faith&quot; was released in 2020.

<text>Agatha Gregson, née Wooster, later Lady Worplesdon, is a recurring fictional character in the Jeeves stories of the British comic writer P. G. Wodehouse, being best known as Bertie Wooster&#x27;s Aunt Agatha. Haughty and overbearing, Aunt Agatha wants Bertie to marry a wife she finds suitable, though she never manages to get Bertie married, thanks to Jeeves&#x27;s interference.

She is often mentioned in the stories as being Bertie&#x27;s fearsome aunt, in contrast to her sister Aunt Dahlia, Bertie&#x27;s genial aunt.

==Inspiration==
The character of Aunt Agatha was inspired by Wodehouse&#x27;s aunt Mary Bathurst Deane, his mother&#x27;s older sister. In a 1955 a letter to his biographer Richard Usborne, Wodehouse wrote &quot;Aunt Agatha is definitely my Aunt Mary, who was the scourge of my childhood.&quot; According to Richard Usborne, &quot;His Aunt Mary (Deane) harried and harassed him a good deal, and blossomed later into Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Agatha. Aunt Mary honestly considered that her harrying and harassing of the young Pelham was for his good; and she may have been right.&quot;

Aunt Agatha&#x27;s country home Woollam Chersey was inspired by Hunstanton Hall, the home of Wodehouse&#x27;s friend Charles Le Strange.

==Life and character==

Generally formidable in appearance, Aunt Agatha is five-foot-nine, with a beaky nose, an eagle eye, and a lot of grey hair. Agatha had at first been affianced to Percy Craye, though upon reading in the papers of his behaviour at a Covent Garden ball, she had ended the engagement. She then married Spenser Gregson, though he dies before &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;. About eighteen months before &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot;, she marries Percy Craye who had by then become Lord Worplesdon, whereupon she becomes Lady Worplesdon. She has one son, Thomas &quot;Thos&quot; Gregson.

Aunt Agatha once portrayed Boadicea in an amateur pageant held at her home, Woollam Chersey. Bertie was obliged to play King Edward III in the same pageant. She lives at Woollam Chersey in Hertfordshire as Agatha Gregson and later, after marrying Percy Craye, becomes Lady Worplesdon and lives at the Craye home of Bumpleigh Hall near Steeple Bumpleigh in Hampshire.

Generally, Aunt Agatha tries to make Bertie marry or tells him to do some task that she feels will benefit the family&#x27;s prestige. Though Bertie is not financially dependent on her, he has been intimidated by her since he was young and, particularly in the early stories, feels compelled to obey her wishes. She has never liked Jeeves, and thinks that Bertie is too dependent on him, calling Jeeves Bertie&#x27;s keeper. She disapproves of Bertie talking to Jeeves about private matters. On one occasion when she hears Bertie ask Jeeves for advice, she tells Jeeves to leave and then scolds Bertie, making remarks to him about &quot;what she thought of a Wooster who could lower the prestige of the clan by allowing menials to get above themselves&quot;.

Aunt Agatha first appears in &quot;Extricating Young Gussie&quot;. This early story is usually not included in the main Jeeves canon (Bertie&#x27;s surname appears to be Mannering-Phipps), though events in the story are referenced in future stories. In this story, Aunt Agatha tells Bertie to go to New York to keep his cousin, Gussie, away from the girl he has fallen in love with, Ray Denison. Aunt Agatha disapproves of Ray because she is a vaudeville performer, and feels that Gussie would disgrace the family by marrying her. Bertie only manages to make the problem (as Aunt Agatha sees it) worse, and decides to avoid her for a while.

In &quot;Aunt Agatha Takes the Count&quot;, she tries to make Bertie marry Aline Hemmingway, and later pushes Bertie to marry Honoria Glossop in &quot;Scoring off Jeeves&quot; and &quot;Sir Roderick Comes to Lunch&quot;. She also appears in &quot;The Delayed Exit of Claude and Eustace&quot;. These stories are in &quot;The Inimitable Jeeves&quot;.

Aunt Agatha wants to get Bertie a job in &quot;Jeeves and the Impending Doom&quot;, tries to get Bertie engaged to Honoria again in &quot;Jeeves and the Yule-tide Spirit&quot;, and instructs Bertie to keep his uncle, George Wooster, Lord Yaxley, from marrying an unsuitable woman in &quot;Indian Summer of an Uncle&quot;. Her pet dog McIntosh, an Aberdeen terrier, is featured in &quot;Episode of the Dog McIntosh&quot;. These stories are collected in &quot;Very Good, Jeeves&quot;,

Though she is frequently mentioned, Aunt Agatha does not directly appear in the novels. At the end of &quot;The Mating Season&quot;, Bertie is heading downstairs to see her, intending to finally stand up to her. Nonetheless, he is afraid of what will happen if information about his misadventures reaches Aunt Agatha in &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;.

==Quotes==
Bertie describes his imperious Aunt Agatha in the following quotes, often mentioning her as a counterpoint to Aunt Dahlia:
* &quot;My experience is that when Aunt Agatha wants you to do a thing you do it, or else you find yourself wondering why those fellows in the olden days made such a fuss when they had trouble with the Spanish Inquisition.&quot;
* &quot;I was looking forward with bright anticipation to the coming reunion with this Dahlia – she, as I may have mentioned before, being my good and deserving aunt, not to be confused with Aunt Agatha, who eats broken bottles and wears barbed wire next to the skin.&quot;
* &quot;Well, this Dahlia is my good and deserving aunt, not to be confused with Aunt Agatha, the one who kills rats with her teeth and devours her young...&quot;
* &quot;Aunt Agatha is cold and haughty, though presumably unbending a bit when conducting human sacrifices at the time of the full moon, as she is widely rumoured to do, and her attitude towards me has always been that of an austere governess, causing me to feel as if I were six years old and she had just caught me stealing jam from the jam cupboard; whereas Aunt Dahlia is as jovial and bonhomous as a pantomime dame in a Christmas pantomime.&quot;
* &quot;The aunt to whom I alluded was my good and deserving Aunt Dahlia, not to be confused with my Aunt Agatha who eats broken bottles and is strongly suspected of turning into a werewolf at the time of the full moon.&quot;

==Influence==
The term &quot;Aunt Agatha&quot; has come to mean a &quot;formidable aunt&quot; or, more generally, &quot;any older woman of fearsome disposition&quot;.

==Adaptations==
; Television
* In the 1965–1967 television series &quot;The World of Wooster&quot;, Aunt Agatha was portrayed by Fabia Drake.
* In the 1990–1993 television series &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, Aunt Agatha was portrayed by Mary Wimbush in the first three series, and Elizabeth Spriggs in the fourth series. Unlike in the original stories, she goes to America and is interested in running an art gallery. She is also the subject of a portrait used for a soup company&#x27;s advertisements, whereas in the original Jeeves canon, a portrait of Bertie Wooster was used.
; Radio
* Judith Furse voiced Aunt Agatha in the 1958 Caedmon recording of &quot;Indian Summer of an Uncle&quot;.
* In the 1973–1981 radio drama series &quot;What Ho! Jeeves&quot;, Joan Sanderson voiced Aunt Agatha.

<text>The order Insectivora (from Latin &quot;insectum&quot; &quot;insect&quot; and &quot;vorare&quot; &quot;to eat&quot;) is a now-abandoned biological grouping within the class of mammals. Some species have now been moved out, leaving the remaining ones in the order Eulipotyphla within the larger clade Laurasiatheria, which makes up one of the basal clades of placental mammals.

==History==
Before the era of widespread DNA sequencing, the grouping was used as a polyphyletic taxon for a variety of small to very small, relatively unspecialised mammals that feed upon insects. Since any primitive-looking fossil group of placental mammals was commonly assigned to this order for convenience, it was held to constitute the basal stock out of which other placental orders had evolved. Therefore, at its widest extent, the order Insectivora represented an evolutionary grade rather than a clade.

Taxonomy has been refined in recent years, and treeshrews, elephant shrews, and colugos have now been placed in separate orders, as have many fossil groups that were formerly included here. For some time it was held that the remaining insectivoran families constituted a monophyletic grouping, or clade, to which the name Lipotyphla had long been applied. However, molecular evidence indicated that Chrysochloridae (golden moles), Tenrecidae (tenrecs), and Potamogalidae (otter shrews) should also be separated as a new order Afrosoricida.

Erinaceidae (hedgehogs) was then also split off into a separate order (Erinaceomorpha) from the remainder (termed Soricomorpha), comprising the families Soricidae (shrews), Talpidae (moles), Solenodontidae, and Nesophontidae. These two orders then replaced Insectivora. This scheme was undermined when molecular studies indicated that Soricomorpha is paraphyletic, because Soricidae shared a more recent common ancestor with Erinaceidae than with other soricomorphs.

However, the combination of Soricidae and Erinaceidae, referred to as order Eulipotyphla, has been shown to be monophyletic.

== Classification ==

* Order Eulipotyphla (remnant of &#x27;Insectivora&#x27;)
** Family Erinaceidae
*** Subfamily Erinaceinae: hedgehogs
*** Subfamily Hylomyinae: moonrats and gymnures
** Family Soricidae
*** Subfamily Crocidurinae: white-toothed shrews
*** Subfamily Soricinae: red-toothed shrews
*** Subfamily Myosoricinae: African white-toothed shrews
** Family Talpidae
*** Subfamily Desmaninae: desmans
*** Subfamily Talpinae: moles
*** Subfamily Uropsilinae: shrew moles
** Family Solenodontidae: solenodons
** Family Nesophontidae: extinct West Indian shrews

Family-level cladogram of extant insectivoran relationships, following Roca et al.:

These families have been placed within Insectivora in the past:
:* Family Chrysochloridae (golden moles)
:* Family Tenrecidae (tenrecs)
:*Family Potamogalidae (otter shrews)
:* Family Macroscelididae (elephant shrews)
:* Family Tupaiidae (true treeshrews)
:*Family Ptilocercidae (pen-tailed treeshrew)
:* Family Cynocephalidae (colugos)

Not to be confused with insectivores (the eaters of insects considered as a feeding behavior), many of which do not belong to Eulipotyphla or the other taxa formerly included within Insectivora.

<text>Vaucluse (; or ) is a department in the southeastern French region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur. It had a population of 561,469 as of 2019. The department&#x27;s prefecture is Avignon.

It is named after a spring, the Fontaine de Vaucluse, one of the largest karst springs in the world. The name Vaucluse itself derives from the Latin (&quot;closed valley&quot;) as the valley ends in a cliff face from which the spring emanates.

==History==
Vaucluse was created on 12 August 1793 out of parts of the departments of Bouches-du-Rhône, Drôme and Basses-Alpes, later renamed Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. The then rural department was, like the nearby city of Lyon, a hotbed of the French Resistance in World War II.

==Geography==
Vaucluse is bordered by the Rhône to the west and the Durance to the south. Mountains occupy a significant proportion of the eastern half of the department, with Mont Ventoux (1,912 m), also known as &quot;the Giant of Provence&quot;, dominating the landscape. Other important mountain ranges include the Dentelles de Montmirail, the Monts de Vaucluse and the Luberon.

The northern part of the department, the Canton of Valréas, forms an enclave within the department Drôme.

Fruit and vegetables are cultivated in great quantities in the lower-lying parts of the department, on one of the most fertile plains in Southern France. The Vaucluse department has a rather large exclave within the Drôme department, the canton of Valréas (Enclave des Papes).

Vaucluse is also known for its karst, including the karst spring Fontaine de Vaucluse after which &quot;Vauclusian Risings&quot; are named.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Avignon, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 20,000 inhabitants:

===Departmental Council===
Following the 2021 departmental election, Dominique Santoni of The Republicans was elected President of the Departmental Council. She succeeded Maurice Chabert, who had held the office since 2015.

The Departmental Council of Vaucluse has 34 seats. The Left Front (FG) currently has 2 seats, the Socialist Party (PS) has 7, Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV) has 3, the miscellaneous right (DVD) has 2, The Republicans (LR) have 10, the National Rally has 6 and a local party, the Ligue du Sud (LS), has 4.

===Members of the National Assembly===

====2022 legislative election====
In the 2022 legislative election, Vaucluse elected the following representatives to the National Assembly:

====2017 legislative election====
During the 2017 legislative election, Vaucluse elected the following representatives to the National Assembly:

*On 21 July 2017, Brune Poirson resigned from office to join the Second Philippe government as Secretary of State to the Minister for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition. She was replaced in the National Assembly by Adrien Morenas.

**Jacques Bompard resigned in August 2017 to become Mayor of Orange. He was replaced by Marie-France Lorho.

<doc id="80696" wikidata="Q12003" url="?curid=80696" title="Cher">
<text>Cher ( ; born Cheryl Sarkisian; May 20, 1946) is an American singer, actress and television personality. Dubbed the &quot;Goddess of Pop&quot;, she is known for her androgynous contralto voice, multifaceted career and bold visual presentation, while cultivating a screen persona that mirrors her public image by often portraying strong-willed, independent and outspoken women. Her adaptability has fueled multiple comebacks, cementing her status as a cultural icon.

Cher gained fame in 1965 as part of the folk rock husband-wife duo Sonny &amp; Cher, while also achieving solo success with top-ten singles including &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot; and &quot;Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot;. In the 1970s, she divorced from Sonny Bono and topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves&quot;, &quot;Half-Breed&quot; and &quot;Dark Lady&quot;. Following a hiatus, she returned to music with the rock-inflected albums &quot;Cher&quot; (1987), &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; (1989) and &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (1991), earning international number-one singles with &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; and &quot;The Shoop Shoop Song (It&#x27;s in His Kiss)&quot;. At age 52, Cher reached a commercial peak with the dance-pop album &quot;Believe&quot; (1998), which introduced the &quot;Cher effect&quot;—an extreme, stylistic use of Auto-Tune to distort vocals. The title track became 1999&#x27;s number-one song in the US and the UK&#x27;s best-selling single by a female artist. 21st-century releases include &quot;Closer to the Truth&quot; (2013) and &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; (2018), both debuting at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and becoming her highest-charting solo albums in the US.

Cher became a television star in the 1970s with &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; and her solo show &quot;Cher&quot;, both on CBS, attracting over 30 million weekly viewers. She earned critical acclaim after debuting on Broadway and starring in the film adaptation of &quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot; (1982). Transitioning to film, Cher received two Academy Award nominations for &quot;Silkwood&quot; (1983) and &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987), winning Best Actress for the latter, and won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for &quot;Mask&quot; (1985). Her other starring roles include &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (1987), &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990), &quot;If These Walls Could Talk&quot; (1996, her directorial debut), &quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot; (1999), &quot;Burlesque&quot; (2010) and &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&quot; (2018). Her life and career inspired the 2018 jukebox musical &quot;The Cher Show&quot;.

Cher is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 100 million records worldwide. She is the only solo artist with number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in seven consecutive decades, from the 1960s to the 2020s. Her accolades include an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Grammy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Icon Award, the Kennedy Center Honor and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Her 2002–2005 Living Proof: The Farewell Tour was the highest-grossing concert tour by a female artist at the time, earning $250 million (about $ million in 2025). Outside of music and acting, Cher is vocal about her progressive political views, and has advocated and fundraised for causes including LGBTQ rights and HIV/AIDS prevention.

== Life and career ==
=== 1946–1961: Early life ===
Cheryl Sarkisian was born in El Centro, California, on May 20, 1946. Her father, John Sarkisian, an Armenian-American truck driver with drug and gambling problems, was rarely present during her early life. Her mother, Georgia Holt (born Jackie Jean Crouch), was a model and actress of Irish, English, German and Cherokee descent. Cher&#x27;s paternal grandparents were survivors of the Armenian Genocide. Her parents divorced when she was ten months old, and Holt later married actor John Southall, with whom she had Cher&#x27;s half-sister, Georganne. Holt&#x27;s marriage to Southall ended when Cher was nine. Cher later described Southall as her &quot;real father&quot;, calling him a &quot;good-natured man who turned belligerent when he drank too much&quot;.

Holt remarried and divorced several times, frequently moving the family across states, including New York, Texas and California. They often struggled financially, and Cher recalled using rubber bands to hold her shoes together. At one point, Holt left Cher at an orphanage for several weeks; although they met every day, both found the experience traumatic. While living in Los Angeles, Holt pursued acting while working as a waitress, occasionally securing minor television roles for her daughters in shows such as &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;.

By fifth grade, Cher organized a class performance of the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, taking on male roles when boys refused to participate. Even at age nine, her voice was unusually low. Fascinated by film stars, Cher idolized Audrey Hepburn, particularly in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), emulating Hepburn&#x27;s character&#x27;s unconventional outfits and demeanor. She also admired Marlene Dietrich, Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, but felt discouraged by the lack of dark-haired actresses in Hollywood. As a child, she dreamed of fame but struggled with feelings of inadequacy, describing herself as &quot;unattractive&quot; and &quot;untalented&quot;. Reflecting on her ambitions, she later said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t think of anything that I could do ... I just thought, &#x27;I&#x27;ll be famous&#x27;. That was my goal.&quot;
In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under the name Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne and enrolled them at Montclair College Preparatory School, a private school in Encino. Coming from a modest background, Cher faced challenges in the upper-class environment, where, as biographer Connie Berman wrote, her &quot;striking appearance&quot; and &quot;outgoing personality&quot; set her apart. A former classmate recalled, &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special ... like a movie star, right then and there ... She said she was going to be a movie star and we knew she would.&quot; Known for her creativity and wit, Cher excelled in French and English but struggled with other subjects, later discovering she has dyslexia. Her unconventional behavior also stood out: she performed songs for students during lunch and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. Cher later reflected, &quot;I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous.&quot;

=== 1962–1967: Solo musical breakthrough and Sonny &amp; Cher ===
At 16, Cher left school and moved out of her mother&#x27;s house to live with a friend. She took acting classes and supported herself by dancing in nightclubs along Hollywood&#x27;s Sunset Strip, where she introduced herself to performers, managers and agents. According to Berman, &quot;[Cher] did not hesitate to approach anyone she thought could help her get a break&quot;. Cher met performer Sonny Bono in November 1962 when he was working for record producer Phil Spector. Cher&#x27;s friend moved out and Cher accepted Sonny&#x27;s offer to be his housekeeper. Sonny introduced Cher to Spector, who used her as a backup singer on many recordings, including the Ronettes&#x27; &quot;Be My Baby&quot; and the Righteous Brothers&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;. Spector produced her first single, &quot;Ringo, I Love You&quot;, which Cher recorded under the name Bonnie Jo Mason. Many radio programmers rejected the song, mistaking Cher&#x27;s deep contralto for a man&#x27;s voice and assuming it was a male homosexual singing a love song to the Beatles drummer Ringo Starr.
Cher and Sonny became close friends, eventual lovers and performed their own unofficial wedding ceremony in a hotel room in Tijuana, Mexico, on October 27, 1964. Although Sonny had wanted to launch Cher as a solo artist, she encouraged him to perform with her because she suffered from stage fright and he began joining her onstage, singing the harmonies. Cher disguised her nervousness by looking at Sonny; she later commented that she sang to the people through him. In late 1964, they emerged as a duo called Caesar &amp; Cleo, releasing the poorly received singles &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot;, &quot;Love Is Strange&quot; and &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot;.

Cher signed with Liberty Records&#x27; Imperial imprint in the end of 1964 and Sonny became her producer. The single &quot;Dream Baby&quot;, released under the name &quot;Cherilyn&quot;, received airplay in Los Angeles. Imperial encouraged Cher to work with Sonny on her second solo single for the label, a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot;. It peaked at number 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number nine on the UK Singles Chart in 1965. Meanwhile, the Byrds had released their own version of the same song. When competition on the singles charts started between Cher and the Byrds, the group&#x27;s record label began to promote the B-side of the Byrds&#x27; single. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds commented, &quot;We loved the Cher version ... We didn&#x27;t want to hassle. So we just turned our record over.&quot; Cher&#x27;s debut album, &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot; (1965), reached number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; it was later described by AllMusic&#x27;s Tim Sendra as &quot;one of the stronger folk-pop records of the era&quot;.

In early 1965, Caesar and Cleo began calling themselves Sonny &amp; Cher. Following the recording of &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;, they traveled to England in July 1965 at the Rolling Stones&#x27; advice; Cher recalled, &quot;[they] had told us ... that Americans just didn&#x27;t get us and that if we were going to make it big, we were going to have to go to England.&quot; According to writer Cintra Wilson, English newspaper photographers showed up when S&amp;C were thrown out of the London Hilton [because of their outfits] the night they arrived—literally overnight, they were stars. London went gaga for the heretofore-unseen S&amp;C look, which was neither mod nor rocker.
&quot;I Got You Babe&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and became, according to AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder, &quot;one of the biggest-selling and most beloved pop/rock hits of the mid-&#x27;60s&quot;; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it among &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2003. As the song knocked the Beatles off the top of the British charts, English teenagers began to emulate Sonny and Cher&#x27;s fashion style, such as bell-bottoms, striped pants and fur vests. Upon their return to the US, the duo made several appearances on the teen-pop showcases &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; and &quot;Shindig!&quot; and completed a tour of some of the largest arenas in the US. Their shows attracted Cher look-alikes, with girls straightening and dyeing their hair black to emulate her style, often pairing it with vests and bell-bottoms.

Sonny and Cher&#x27;s first album, &quot;Look at Us&quot; (1965), released for the Atco Records division of Atlantic Records, spent eight weeks at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, behind the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Help!&quot;. The duo successfully competed with the dominant British Invasion and Motown sounds of the era. Author Joseph Murrells described Sonny and Cher as &quot;leading exponents of the rock-folk-message type of song&quot;, blending rock instrumentation with folk themes and protest lyrics. They charted ten &quot;Billboard&quot; top 40 singles between 1965 and 1972, including five top-ten singles: &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;, &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;, &quot;All I Ever Need Is You&quot; and &quot;A Cowboy&#x27;s Work Is Never Done&quot;. At one point, they had five songs in the top 50 at the same time, a feat equaled only by the Beatles and Elvis Presley. Together they had become, according to &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ginia Bellafante, rock&#x27;s &quot;it&quot; couple.

Cher&#x27;s subsequent releases kept her solo career competitive with her work with Sonny. &quot;The Sonny Side of Chér&quot; (1966) features &quot;Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot;, which reached number two in the US and number three in the UK and became her first million-seller solo single. &quot;Chér&quot;, also released in 1966, contains the Burt Bacharach and Hal David composition &quot;Alfie&quot;, which was added to the credits of the American version of the 1966 film of the same name and became the first stateside version of the popular song. &quot;With Love, Chér&quot; (1967) includes songs described by biographer Mark Bego as &quot;little soap-opera stories set to rock music&quot; such as the US top-ten single &quot;You Better Sit Down Kids&quot;.

=== 1967–1970: From counterculture icon to lounge act ===

By the late 1960s, Sonny and Cher&#x27;s music stopped charting. Berman observed that the &quot;heavy, loud sound&quot; of bands such as Jefferson Airplane and Cream made their folk-rock feel &quot;too bland.&quot; Cher later said she &quot;loved&quot; the new electric-guitar-driven sound of Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton and wanted to adapt, but Sonny refused. Their monogamous lifestyle during the sexual revolution and anti-drug stance at the height of widespread drug use alienated American youths. According to Bego, &quot;in spite of their revolutionary unisex clothes, Sonny and Cher were quite &#x27;square&#x27; when it came to sex and drugs.&quot; In an attempt to recapture their young audience, the duo produced and starred in the film &quot;Good Times&quot; (1967), which was commercially unsuccessful.

Cher&#x27;s album &quot;Backstage&quot; (1968), in which she explores diverse musical genres including Brazilian jazz and anti-war protest settings, was not a commercial success. In 1969, Cher was dropped from Imperial Records, while Sonny and Cher were dropped from Atco. However, Atco offered her a solo album deal. &quot;3614 Jackson Highway&quot; (1969) was recorded without the guidance of Sonny and incorporates experiments in R&amp;B and soul music. AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming proclaimed it &quot;arguably the finest album of her career&quot; and still &quot;a revelation&quot; decades later. Displeased with the album, Sonny prevented Cher from releasing more recordings for Atco.

Meanwhile, Sonny dated others and by the end of the 1960s their relationship had begun to unravel. According to &quot;People&quot; magazine, &quot;[Sonny] tried desperately to win her back, telling her he wanted to marry and start a family.&quot; They officially married after she gave birth to Chaz Bono on March 4, 1969. The duo spent $500,000 and mortgaged their home to make the film &quot;Chastity&quot; (1969). Written and produced by Sonny, it tells the story of a young woman, played by Cher, searching for the meaning of life. The art film failed commercially, putting the couple $190,000 in debt with back taxes. However, some critics noted that Cher showed acting potential; &quot;Cue&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Cher has a marvelous quality that often makes you forget the lines you are hearing.&quot;

At the lowest point of their career, the duo put together a nightclub routine that relied on a more adult approach to sound and style. According to writer Cintra Wilson, &quot;Their lounge act was so depressing, people started heckling them. Then Cher started heckling back. Sonny ... reprimanded her; then she&#x27;d heckle Sonny&quot;. The heckling became a highlight of the act and attracted viewers. Television executives took note and the couple began making guest appearances on prime-time shows, in which they presented a &quot;new, sophisticated and mature&quot; image. Cher adopted alluring, low-cut gowns that became her signature outfits.

=== 1971–1974: Television stardom and first musical comeback ===

CBS head of programming Fred Silverman offered Sonny and Cher their own television program after he noticed them as guest-hosts on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; in 1971. &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; premiered as a summer replacement series on August 1, 1971 and had six episodes. Because it was a ratings success, the couple returned that December with a full-time show.

Watched by more than 30 million viewers weekly during its three-year run, &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; was praised for the comedic timing, as a deadpan Cher mocked Sonny about his looks and short stature. According to Berman, they &quot;exuded an aura of warmth, playfulness and caring that only enhanced their appeal. Viewers were further enchanted when a young [Chaz] appeared on the show. They seemed like a perfect family.&quot; Cher honed her acting skills through comedy sketches, including her original character Laverne, a brash and over-the-top housewife, while her Bob Mackie-designed outfits set 1970s fashion trends.

In 1971, Sonny and Cher signed with the Kapp Records division of MCA Records and Cher released the single &quot;Classified 1A&quot;, in which she sings from the point of view of a soldier who bleeds to death in Vietnam. Written by Sonny, who felt that her first solo single on the label had to be poignant and topical, the song was rejected by radio station programmers as uncommercial.
Since Sonny&#x27;s first attempts at reviving their recording career as a duo had also been unsuccessful, Kapp Records recruited Snuff Garrett to work with them. He produced Cher&#x27;s second US number-one single, &quot;Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves&quot;, which &quot;proved that ... Garrett knew more about Cher&#x27;s voice and her persona as a singer than Sonny did&quot;, writes Bego. &quot;Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves&quot; was the first single by a solo artist to rank number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at the same time as on the Canadian Singles Chart. &quot;Billboard&quot; called it &quot;one of the 20th century&#x27;s greatest songs&quot;. It was featured on the 1971 album &quot;Chér&quot; (eventually reissued under the title &quot;Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves&quot;), which was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its second single, &quot;The Way of Love&quot;, reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and established Cher&#x27;s more confident image as a recording artist.

In 1972, Cher released the all-ballad set &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, demonstrating the evolution of her vocal abilities, according to Bego. Following the release, Garrett quit as producer after disagreeing with Sonny about the kind of material Cher should record. At Sonny&#x27;s insistence, in 1973 Cher released an album of standards called &quot;Bittersweet White Light&quot;, which was commercially unsuccessful. That year, lyricist Mary Dean brought Garrett &quot;Half-Breed&quot;, a song about the daughter of a Cherokee mother and a white father, which she had written especially for Cher. Although Garrett did not have Cher as a client at the time, he was convinced that &quot;it&#x27;s a smash for Cher and for nobody else&quot;, so he held the song for months until he got Cher back. &quot;Half-Breed&quot; became the title track of her next album and her third US number-one single. Both the album and the single were certified gold by the RIAA.

In 1974, Cher released &quot;Dark Lady&quot; as the lead single from the album of the same name. It topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, tying her with Rosemary Clooney, Patti Page and Connie Francis for the most number-one singles by a female solo artist in US history at the time. Later that year, she released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album that, according to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, proved her to be &quot;one of the most consistent hitmakers of the past five years&quot;, as well as a &quot;proven superstar who always sells records&quot;. Between 1971 and 1973, Sonny and Cher&#x27;s recording career was revived with four albums released under Kapp Records and MCA Records: &quot;Sonny &amp; Cher Live&quot; (1971), &quot;All I Ever Need Is You&quot; (1972), &quot;Mama Was a Rock and Roll Singer, Papa Used to Write All Her Songs&quot; (1973) and &quot;Live in Las Vegas Vol. 2&quot; (1973). Cher later commented that her tight schedule during this period required her to record entire albums in just a few days while also touring and filming &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;.

=== 1974–1979: Divorce from Sonny Bono, marriage to Gregg Allman and decline in popularity ===

Cher and Sonny had had marital problems since late 1972, but appearances were maintained until 1974. &quot;The public still thinks we are married,&quot; Sonny wrote in his diary at the time, &quot;[and] that&#x27;s the way it has to be.&quot; In February 1974, Sonny filed for separation, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. A week later, Cher countered with a divorce suit and charged Sonny with &quot;involuntary servitude&quot;, claiming that he withheld her rightful share of their earnings. The couple battled in court over finances and the custody of Chaz, which was eventually granted to Cher. Their divorce was finalized on June 26, 1975.

During the divorce proceedings, Cher had a two-year romantic relationship with record executive David Geffen, who helped free her from a restrictive business arrangement with Sonny. Under the terms of this arrangement, Cher was required to work exclusively for Cher Enterprises, a company 95% owned by Sonny and 5% by his lawyer. She was considered an employee of the company, with no control over her career and finances. Cher won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy for &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; in 1974. That year, Sonny premiered a solo show, &quot;The Sonny Comedy Revue&quot;, which carried the creative team behind the Sonny and Cher show. It was canceled after 13 weeks.

In 1975, Cher signed a $2.5 million deal with Warner Bros. Records and began work on her first album with the label. According to Bego, &quot;it was their intention that [this album] was going to make millions of fans around the world take her seriously as a rock star and not just a pop singer.&quot; Despite Cher&#x27;s efforts to expand her musical range by drawing inspiration from artists such as Stevie Wonder, Elton John, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan, the resulting album, &quot;Stars,&quot; was commercially and critically unsuccessful. Janet Maslin of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote, &quot;Cher is just no rock and roller ... Image, not music, is Cher Bono&#x27;s main ingredient for both records and TV.&quot; Despite its initial failure, the album later gained cult status and is considered among her best work.

On February 16, 1975, Cher debuted her solo CBS show, &quot;Cher&quot;. It began as a highly rated special with guests Bette Midler, Elton John and Flip Wilson. Produced by Geffen, the show showcased Cher&#x27;s music, comedy, monologues, and an extensive wardrobe—the largest for a weekly TV series. Critics praised it, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stating, &quot;Sonny without Cher was a disaster. Cher without Sonny, on the other hand, could be the best thing that&#x27;s happened to weekly television this season.&quot; Despite high ratings, the show ended within a year, replaced by a new show reuniting her with ex-husband Sonny. &quot;The Ringer&quot;″s Lindsay Zoladz commented that network censors were stricter with Cher as a single woman, viewing her as more provocative alone than as Sonny&#x27;s wife. Reflecting later, Cher said, &quot;Doing a show alone was more than I could handle.&quot;
On June 30, 1975, four days after finalizing her divorce from Sonny, Cher married rock musician Gregg Allman, co-founder of the Allman Brothers Band. She filed for divorce nine days later because of his heroin and liquor problems, but they reconciled within a month. They had one son, Elijah Blue, on July 10, 1976. Sonny and Cher&#x27;s TV reunion, &quot;The Sonny and Cher Show&quot;, debuted on CBS in February 1976—the first show ever to star a divorced couple. Although the show was a ratings success on its premiere, Cher and Sonny&#x27;s insulting onscreen banter about their divorce, her reportedly extravagant lifestyle and her troubled relationship with Allman caused a public backlash that contributed to the show&#x27;s cancellation in August 1977.

In 1976, Mego Toys released a line of Sonny &amp; Cher dolls. The Cher doll became the year&#x27;s best-selling doll, surpassing Barbie. Cher&#x27;s next albums, &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Believe in You&quot; (1976) and &quot;Cherished&quot; (1977)—the latter marking a return to her earlier pop storyteller style at Warner&#x27;s producers&#x27; insistence—were commercial failures. &quot;Orange Coast&quot; magazine&#x27;s Keith Tuber commented that Cher&#x27;s weekly TV shows may have hurt her record sales, as audiences could see and hear her without needing to buy her music.

In 1977, under the rubric &quot;Allman and Woman&quot;, Cher and Allman recorded the duet album &quot;Two the Hard Way&quot;. The couple toured Europe to support the album, though audience reception was mixed. With a combination of Cher fans and Allman Brothers fans in attendance, fights frequently broke out at venues, prompting Cher to cancel the tour. Their relationship ended soon after the tour&#x27;s cancellation, and their divorce was finalized in 1979. In 1978, Cher began a two-year live-in relationship with Kiss member Gene Simmons. She briefly returned to prime time television with the specials &quot;Cher... Special&quot; (1978)—featuring a segment in which she performs all of the roles in her version of &quot;West Side Story&quot;— and &quot;Cher... and Other Fantasies&quot; (1979).

=== 1979–1982: Second musical comeback, from disco success to leading a rock band ===
In 1979, Cher legally adopted her mononym. Facing financial pressures as a single mother of two, she decided to steer her singing career toward greater commercial success. Temporarily setting aside her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with Casablanca Records and launched a comeback with the single &quot;Take Me Home&quot; and the album of the same name, both of which capitalized on the disco craze. The album and single became instant successes, remained bestsellers for more than half of 1979 and were certified gold by the RIAA. The album&#x27;s sales were likely enhanced by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a Viking outfit on its cover. Although initially reluctant to embrace disco music, she changed her mind after the success, saying, &quot;I never thought I would want to do disco ... [but] it&#x27;s terrific! It&#x27;s great music to dance to. I think that danceable music is what everybody wants.&quot;
Encouraged by the popularity of &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, Cher sought a return to rock with &quot;Prisoner&quot; (1979). The album cover, showing her naked and draped in chains, symbolized her struggle as a &quot;prisoner of the press&quot; amid intense tabloid scrutiny. The imagery drew criticism from feminist groups for her perceived portrayal of a sex slave, while critics found the album&#x27;s mix of rock and disco tracks inconsistent, contributing to its commercial failure. The single &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;, featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Roller Boogie&quot;, reflected Cher&#x27;s personal embrace of the late 1970s roller-skating craze, which she had helped popularize. Cher collaborated with Giorgio Moroder to write &quot;Bad Love&quot;, her final Casablanca disco track, for the film &quot;Foxes&quot; (1980).

In 1980, Cher formed the rock band Black Rose with guitarist and then-partner Les Dudek. To blend in and avoid overshadowing the group with her celebrity status, she adopted a punk-inspired look, cutting her signature long hair. Although she was the lead singer, she chose not to take top billing to present the band as equal. Despite television appearances, the band struggled to book concerts. Their album, &quot;Black Rose&quot;, received poor reviews; Cher told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;[Critics] didn&#x27;t attack the record, they attacked me. It was like, &#x27;How dare Cher sing rock &amp; roll?&#x27;&quot; Black Rose disbanded in 1981.

During Black Rose&#x27;s run, Cher was also performing a residency at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, with two shows nightly, seven days a week, earning $300,000 weekly. Beginning in June 1979 and running until 1982, the residency evolved into Cher&#x27;s first solo tour, the Take Me Home Tour, with dates in North America, Europe, South Africa and Australia. Described by &quot;The Press of Atlantic City&quot; as &quot;the biggest cabaret act ever seen on any stage&quot;, the concert series yielded two television specials: &quot;Standing Room Only: Cher in Concert&quot; (1981) and &quot;Cher... A Celebration at Caesars&quot; (1983), the latter earning her the CableACE Award for Best Actress in a Variety Program. In 1981, Cher collaborated with Meat Loaf on the duet &quot;Dead Ringer for Love&quot;, which peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart and was praised by AllMusic&#x27;s Donald A. Guarisco as &quot;one of the more inspired rock duets of the 1980s&quot;. The following year, Cher released the new wave album &quot;I Paralyze&quot;, a commercial failure and her only album under Columbia Records.

=== 1982–1987: Broadway debut, acting breakthrough and musical hiatus ===

With declining record sales and radio airplay, Cher shifted her focus to acting. Despite earlier aspirations, her only film credits, &quot;Good Times&quot; and &quot;Chastity&quot;, were critical and commercial failures, and Hollywood did not take her seriously as an actress. Reflecting on this period, Cher said, &quot;I was dropped by my [label] and couldn&#x27;t get a job ... [so] I went to Las Vegas&quot;, which she likened to an &quot;elephant&#x27;s graveyard&quot; for fading stars. Despite her success performing there, she felt unfulfilled: &quot;I was making a fortune ... but I was dying inside.&quot; In 1982, she moved to New York to study acting with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio, but never enrolled. She auditioned for and was cast by Robert Altman in the Broadway production &quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot;. She played a James Dean fan club member at a 20-year reunion. That year, Altman cast her again in the film adaptation of the same title.
Director Mike Nichols, who had seen Cher onstage in &quot;Jimmy Dean&quot;, offered her the part of Dolly Pelliker, Meryl Streep&#x27;s lesbian roommate in the film &quot;Silkwood&quot;. When it premiered in 1983, audiences questioned Cher&#x27;s ability as an actress. She recalls attending a film preview during which the audience laughed when they saw her name in the credits. For her performance, Cher was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.

Cher&#x27;s next film, &quot;Mask&quot; (1985), reached number two at the box office and was Cher&#x27;s first critical and commercial success as a leading actress. For her role as a drug addict biker with a disfigured teenage son, she won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress. During the making of the film, however, she clashed with director Peter Bogdanovich and was ultimately omitted from the Oscar nomination list. She attended the 58th Academy Awards in a tarantula-like costume, later deemed by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; Esther Zuckerman as Cher&#x27;s &quot;Oscar revenge dress&quot;. &quot;As you can see, I did receive my Academy booklet on how to dress like a serious actress,&quot; Cher declared before presenting the nominees for Best Supporting Actor. The incident garnered her much publicity.

Cher&#x27;s May 1986 guest appearance on talk show &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, during which she called Letterman &quot;an asshole&quot;, attracted much media coverage; Letterman later recalled, &quot;It did hurt my feelings. Cher was one of the few people I&#x27;ve really wanted to have on the show ... I felt like a total fool, especially since I say all kinds of things to people.&quot; She returned to the show in 1987, reuniting with Sonny for the last time before his death to sing an impromptu version of &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Andy Greene, &quot;they weren&#x27;t exactly the best of friends at this point, but both of them knew it would make for unforgettable television. Had YouTube existed back then, this would have gone insanely viral the next morning.&quot;

=== 1987–1992: Hollywood stardom and third musical comeback ===

Cher starred in three films in 1987. In &quot;Suspect&quot;, she portrayed a public defender aided and romanced by a juror (Dennis Quaid) in a homicide case. In George Miller&#x27;s comedy horror &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;, she was one of three small-town divorcees, alongside Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon, who become involved with a mysterious and wealthy visitor (Jack Nicholson). In Norman Jewison&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Moonstruck&quot;, she played an Italian widow who falls for her fiancé&#x27;s younger brother (Nicolas Cage). The latter two films ranked among 1987&#x27;s top ten highest-grossing movies.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Janet Maslin wrote &quot;Moonstruck&quot; &quot;offers further proof that Cher has evolved into the kind of larger-than-life movie star who&#x27;s worth watching whatever she does.&quot; For that film, Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. By 1988, Cher had become one of the most bankable actresses of the decade, commanding $1 million per film. That year, she released the fragrance Uninhibited, which earned about $15 million in its first year sales.

In 1987, Cher signed with Geffen Records and revived her musical career with what music critics Johnny Danza and Dean Ferguson describe as &quot;her most impressive string of hits to date&quot;, establishing her as a &quot;serious rock and roller ... a crown that she&#x27;d worked long and hard to capture&quot;. Michael Bolton, Jon Bon Jovi, Desmond Child and Richie Sambora produced her first Geffen album, &quot;Cher&quot;. Despite facing strong retail and radio airplay resistance upon its release, the album proved to be a commercial success, certified platinum by the RIAA. &quot;Cher&quot; features the rock ballad &quot;I Found Someone&quot;, Cher&#x27;s first US top-ten single in more than eight years.

By the late 1980s, Cher had gained a reputation for her exhibitionist fashion sense, plastic surgeries and affairs with younger men. She had romantic relationships with actors Val Kilmer, Eric Stoltz and Tom Cruise, hockey player Ron Duguay, film producer Josh Donen, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora and Rob Camilletti, a bagel baker 18 years her junior whom she dated from 1986 to 1989.
Cher&#x27;s 19th studio album &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; (1989) was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. Its second single, &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot;, became one of her most successful songs, topping the Australian charts for seven weeks and reaching number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The track&#x27;s music video, filmed aboard the battleship , generated controversy for its sexually suggestive imagery. Other US top-ten singles from &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; were &quot;After All&quot;, a duet with Peter Cetera, and &quot;Just Like Jesse James&quot;. Cher won the Favorite All-Around Female Star Award at the 1989 People&#x27;s Choice Awards and launched the Heart of Stone Tour the same year. Critics praised the tour&#x27;s nostalgia and Cher&#x27;s showmanship. A television special, &quot;&quot; (1991), was filmed during a Las Vegas concert.

In &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990), her first film in three years, Cher drew inspiration from her mother to portray a woman who moves her daughters (Winona Ryder, Christina Ricci) from town to town after failed relationships. She clashed with the film&#x27;s first two directors, Lasse Hallström and Frank Oz, who were replaced by Richard Benjamin. Producers, seeing Cher as the star attraction, granted her creative control. The film was a box office success and received positive reviews. One of the two songs Cher recorded for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, a cover of Betty Everett&#x27;s &quot;The Shoop Shoop Song (It&#x27;s in His Kiss)&quot;, topped the UK Singles Chart for five weeks.

Cher&#x27;s final studio album with Geffen Records, &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (1991), spent six weeks at number one in the UK and produced the UK top-ten single &quot;Love and Understanding&quot;. The album was certified gold by the RIAA. In later years, Cher commented that her Geffen label &quot;hit years&quot; had been especially significant to her, &quot;because I was getting to do songs that I really loved ... songs that really represented me and they were popular!&quot; In 1991, she published the exercise book &quot;Forever Fit&quot;, followed by the fitness videos &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; in 1992. That same year, she embarked on the Love Hurts Tour and released the UK-only compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits: 1965–1992&quot;, which topped the UK Albums Chart for seven weeks.

=== 1992–1998: From A-list actress to infomercial queen, death of Sonny Bono ===
According to Berman, the unexpected acclaim for &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987) made Cher &quot;overly cautious&quot; about future roles, mindful of the high expectations. Partly due to her difficult experience filming &quot;Mermaids&quot;, she turned down leading roles in &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; and &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;. In the early 1990s, she contracted the Epstein–Barr virus and developed Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, leaving her too exhausted for music or film projects. To generate income, she appeared in infomercials for health, beauty and diet products, earning nearly $10 million. These skits were parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and critics viewed them as a sellout, speculating her film career was over. The 1995 film &quot;Clueless&quot; references this period, with protagonist Cher Horowitz joking she was named after a &quot;great [singer] of the past who now does infomercials&quot;. Cher later remarked, &quot;Suddenly I became the Infomercial Queen ... people stripped me of all my other things.&quot;
Cher made cameo appearances in the Robert Altman films &quot;The Player&quot; (1992) and &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; (1994). In 1994, she launched a Gothic-themed mail-order catalog, &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, and contributed a rock version of &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; to MTV&#x27;s animated sitcom &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. In 1995, she topped the UK Singles Chart with the charity single &quot;Love Can Build a Bridge&quot;, alongside Chrissie Hynde, Neneh Cherry and Eric Clapton. That year, she signed with Warner Music UK&#x27;s WEA label and released &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot; (1995), an album of songs originally performed by men. Critics praised its R&amp;B influences and Cher&#x27;s vocal growth, with Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it a &quot;soulful collection of grown-up pop songs&quot; and the highlight of her recording career. The album features &quot;Walking in Memphis&quot;, certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), and the UK top-ten single &quot;One by One&quot;. It reached number 10 on the UK Albums Chart. A remixed US version, shifting from rock to a more radio-friendly sound, was less successful, peaking at number 64 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 1996, Cher starred alongside Demi Moore and Sissy Spacek in &quot;If These Walls Could Talk&quot; (1996), a three-part anthology television film about abortion. This project marked Cher&#x27;s directorial debut, as she was both the director and star of the film&#x27;s final segment, playing a doctor targeted by an anti-abortion group. It became the highest-rated original HBO movie to date, attracting 6.9 million viewers. That same year, Cher appeared in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;Faithful&quot;, playing the wife of a businessman who hires a hitman (Chazz Palminteri) to kill her. While the film received negative reviews, Cher was praised for her role, with &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Janet Maslin noting she &quot;does her game best to find comic potential in a victim&#x27;s role.&quot; Cher refused to promote the film, claiming it was &quot;horrible.&quot; Her music played a large role in the American TV series &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;The Post-Modern Prometheus&quot; (1997). Written with her in mind, it tells the story of a scientist&#x27;s grotesque creature who idolizes Cher because of her role in &quot;Mask&quot;, where her character cares for her disfigured son.

Following Sonny Bono&#x27;s death in a skiing accident in 1998, Cher delivered a tearful eulogy at his funeral, calling him &quot;the most unforgettable character&quot; she had met. She paid tribute to him by hosting the CBS special &quot;Sonny &amp; Me: Cher Remembers&quot;, which aired on May 20, 1998. That month, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. Later that year, Cher published &quot;The First Time&quot;, a collection of autobiographical essays of &quot;first-time&quot; events in her life, which critics praised as down-to-earth and genuine. Although the manuscript was almost finished when Sonny died, she could not decide whether to include his death in the book; she feared being criticized for capitalizing on the event. She told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t ignore it, could I? I might have if I cared more about what people think than what I know is right for me.&quot;

=== 1998–2002: Fourth musical comeback and songwriting debut ===
Cher&#x27;s 22nd studio album, &quot;Believe&quot; (1998), marked a departure from her previous rock sound to 1970s disco-inspired dance-pop. It sold 10 million copies worldwide, achieving quadruple platinum status in the US and gold or platinum certifications in 39 countries. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the album as &quot;the most dramatic comeback Hollywood has seen since ... the last time Cher raised her career from the dead&quot;, emphasizing its role in introducing her to a new generation of fans who &quot;hadn&#x27;t yet been born when &#x27;I Got You Babe&#x27; ruled the charts in 1965.&quot;
&quot;Believe&quot;″s title track reached number one in 23 countries and sold over 10 million copies globally. It was the best-selling single of 1998 in the UK and of 1999 in the US. &quot;Believe&quot; debuted at number one in the UK, held the position for seven weeks and became the UK&#x27;s best-selling single by a female artist. In the US, it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for four weeks, making Cher, at 52, the oldest female artist to top the chart. &quot;Believe&quot; earned Cher the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording and the 1999 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award for Hot 100 Single of the Year. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it among &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2021.

On January 31, 1999, Cher sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, the US national anthem, at the Super Bowl XXXIII. She co-headlined the television special &quot;VH1 Divas Live &#x27;99&quot;, which drew 19.4 million viewers, becoming the highest-rated program in VH1&#x27;s history at the time. Her Do You Believe? Tour (1999–2000) sold out in every American city it visited, drawing a global audience of over 1.5 million. Its companion television special, &quot;Cher: Live in Concert – From the MGM Grand in Las Vegas&quot; (1999), achieved a 13.0 rating, making it HBO&#x27;s highest-rated original program of 1998–1999.

&quot;Billboard&quot; named Cher the top dance artist of 1999. Her former label, Geffen, capitalized on her success with the US-only compilation &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time: Cher&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; (1999), certified gold by the RIAA, while Cher oversaw &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot; (1999) for international markets, selling three million copies outside the US by January 2000. Cher starred in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s critically acclaimed war film &quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot; (1999), playing a flamboyant American socialite unwelcome among Englishwomen in Italy. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described her performance as &quot;always likable, always soft-focus, always strange,&quot; while &quot;Film Comment&quot; wrote that she proved &quot;how sorely she&#x27;s been missed from movie screens.&quot;

In 2000, Cher released &quot;Not Commercial&quot;, an album she wrote after attending a songwriting conference in 1994; it marked her first attempt at writing most of the tracks for an album. Rejected by her label for being uncommercial, she sold it exclusively on her website. The song &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot;, which criticizes as &quot;cruel, heartless and wicked&quot; the nuns who had prevented her mother from retrieving her from a Catholic orphanage, drew condemnation from the Catholic Church. Her dance-focused follow-up to &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;Living Proof&quot; (2001), debuted at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA. It features the UK top-ten single &quot;The Music&#x27;s No Good Without You&quot; and &quot;Song for the Lonely&quot;, a tribute to &quot;the courageous people of New York&quot; following the September 11 attacks. Named &quot;Billboard&quot;″s top dance artist of 2002, Cher received the Artist Achievement Award from Steven Tyler at the 2002 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards for having &quot;helped redefine popular music with massive success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.&quot; That year, her wealth was estimated at $600 million.

=== 2002–2018: Farewell tours, concert residencies and return to acting and recording ===

In June 2002, Cher launched the Living Proof: The Farewell Tour, promoted as her final concert tour, though she planned to keep recording and acting. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised it as a celebration of Cher&#x27;s resilience, highlighting her ability to &quot;triumph over restraint, aging and gravity&quot; and calling her &quot;a hit machine immune to sagging flesh&quot;. Initially set for 49 shows, the tour was repeatedly extended. By October 2003, it had become the most successful tour by a female artist, grossing $145 million from 200 shows with 2.2 million attendees. The NBC special &quot;Cher: The Farewell Tour&quot; drew 17 million viewers, becoming the highest-rated network concert special of 2003 and earning Cher the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded).

After leaving Warner UK in 2002, Cher signed a global deal with Warner Bros. Records in September 2003. &quot;Forbes&quot; named her the highest-paid female musician of 2003, earning $33.1 million. The compilation album &quot;The Very Best of Cher&quot; (2003) peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. In the Farrelly brothers″ comedy &quot;Stuck on You&quot; (2003), Cher played a satirical version of herself in a relationship with a high schooler (Frankie Muniz), referencing media scrutiny of her relationships with younger men. Cher&#x27;s Farewell Tour concluded in April 2005 after 325 shows, drawing over 3.5 million attendees and grossing $250 million, ranking among the top-ten highest-grossing tours of the 2000s.
After three years of retirement, Cher began a three-year, 200-show residency in 2008 at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, earning a reported $60 million. Titled Cher, the production featured advanced stage effects and over 20 costume changes. In &quot;Burlesque&quot; (2010), her first musical film since &quot;Good Times&quot; (1967), she played a nightclub owner mentoring a Hollywood hopeful (Christina Aguilera). Her song &quot;You Haven&#x27;t Seen the Last of Me&quot;, from the film&#x27;s soundtrack, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart in January 2011, making Cher the only artist with &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one singles in six consecutive decades (1960s–2010s).

In 2011, Cher lent her voice to Janet the Lioness in the comedy &quot;Zookeeper&quot;. &quot;Dear Mom, Love Cher&quot;, a documentary she produced about her mother Georgia Holt, aired on Lifetime in May 2013. &quot;Closer to the Truth&quot; (2013), Cher&#x27;s 25th studio album and the first since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Living Proof&quot;, entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number three, her highest position on that chart to date. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Michael Andor Brodeur commented that &quot;Cher&#x27;s &#x27;Goddess of Pop&#x27; sash remains in little danger of undue snatching; at 67, she sounds more convincing than J-Lo or Madonna reporting from &#x27;the club&#x27;&quot;. Cher premiered the lead single &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot; on the season four finale of the talent show &quot;The Voice&quot;, her first live TV performance in over a decade. She later joined the show&#x27;s season five as judge Blake Shelton&#x27;s team adviser.
In June 2013, Cher headlined the annual Dance on the Pier benefit, celebrating LGBTQ Pride Day, achieving the event&#x27;s first full-capacity crowd in five years. She embarked on the Dressed to Kill Tour in March 2014, nearly a decade after announcing her &quot;farewell tour&quot;, joking during shows that this would actually be her last farewell tour while crossing fingers. The tour&#x27;s first leg, comprising 49 sold-out shows in North America, grossed $54.9 million. Later that year, she canceled all remaining dates due to a kidney infection. Cher collaborated with American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan on their 2015 album &quot;Once Upon a Time in Shaolin&quot;, credited under her 1964 alias, Bonnie Jo Mason. The album, produced as a single copy and sold via online auction, became the most expensive album ever sold.

After attending the 2015 Met Gala as Marc Jacobs&#x27;s guest, Cher became the face of his Fall/Winter campaign. In February 2017, she launched Classic Cher, a three-year concert residency at the Park Theater in Las Vegas and The Theater at MGM National Harbor in Washington, D.C. At the 2017 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, Cher performed &quot;Believe&quot; and &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot;, her first awards show performance in over 15 years. Gwen Stefani presented Cher with the &quot;Billboard&quot; Icon Award, calling her the &quot;definition of the word Icon&quot; and a role model of strength and authenticity. In March 2018, Cher headlined the 40th Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, with tickets selling out in three hours after she hinted at her involvement on Twitter.

=== 2018–2022: ABBA-related projects and ventures in fashion ===
Cher returned to film after nearly a decade in &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&quot; (2018), a jukebox musical romantic comedy based on the songs of ABBA. The film serves as both a prequel and a sequel to the 2008 film &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; and features Cher as Ruby Sheridan, the mother of Donna (Meryl Streep) and grandmother of Sophie (Amanda Seyfried). Critics praised Cher&#x27;s performance as a highlight of the movie, with &quot;New York&quot; magazine commenting, &quot;Every single movie—no matter how flawless—would be infinitely better if it included Cher.&quot; For the film&#x27;s soundtrack, she recorded two ABBA songs, &quot;Fernando&quot; and &quot;Super Trouper&quot;. Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA stated, &quot;She makes &#x27;Fernando&#x27; her own. It&#x27;s her song now.&quot;
While promoting &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&quot;, Cher announced she was working on an album of ABBA covers. Released in September 2018, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, tying with 2013&#x27;s &quot;Closer to the Truth&quot; as Cher&#x27;s highest-charting solo album in the US. With first-week sales of 153,000 units, it achieved the year&#x27;s biggest sales week for a pop album by a female artist and marked Cher&#x27;s largest sales week since 1991. The album also topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Album Sales chart. &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; received widespread critical acclaim; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented that Cher makes the ABBA songs sound as if they were written for her, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised it as her &quot;most significant release since 1998&#x27;s &quot;Believe&quot;.&quot;

Cher embarked on the Here We Go Again Tour in 2018, which continued until 2020, when it was indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. &quot;The Cher Show&quot;, a biographical jukebox musical based on Cher&#x27;s life and music, premiered in Chicago in June 2018. Featuring three actresses portraying Cher at different stages of her life, it ran on Broadway from December 2018 to August 2019. Subsequent productions toured the UK, Ireland and the US. On December 2, 2018, Cher received the Kennedy Center Honor in recognition of her &quot;extraordinary contributions to culture&quot;, with tribute performances of her songs by Adam Lambert, Cyndi Lauper and Little Big Town. The following year, Cher launched Cher Eau de Couture, her second fragrance, which she described as a &quot;genderless&quot; follow-up to 1987&#x27;s Uninhibited.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Cher focused on projects that could be completed from home. In May 2020, she released her first Spanish-language song, a cover of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Chiquitita&quot;, with proceeds donated to UNICEF. Later that year, she joined the charity supergroup BBC Radio 2 Allstars for a cover of Oasis&#x27;s &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot;. The recording, made in support of the Children in Need charity, became a UK top-ten single. Cher voiced a bobblehead version of herself in the animated film &quot;&quot; (2020). She was featured in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Actors&quot; list for 2020, becoming the first actor included without appearing in a theatrical release that year; her performance in &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987) was praised as &quot;radiant&quot; and a source of comfort during quarantine.

In the early 2020s, Cher collaborated with major fashion brands. She starred in Dsquared2&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2020 campaign, MAC Cosmetics&#x27; &quot;Challenge Accepted&quot; campaign in January 2022 and UGG&#x27;s &quot;Feel&quot; campaign the same month. For Pride Month in June 2022, Cher partnered with Versace to launch the &quot;Chersace&quot; capsule collection, with proceeds benefiting the LGBTQIA+ charity Gender Spectrum. In September 2022, she walked the runway at Paris Fashion Week, closing Balmain&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2023 show, and in November, she starred in the brand&#x27;s &quot;Balmain Blaze&quot; campaign. That month, Cher began dating music executive Alexander Edwards, 40 years her junior. Their age gap sparked criticism online, which she addressed by tweeting, &quot;Love doesn&#x27;t know math.&quot;

=== 2023–present: &quot;Christmas&quot;, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction and memoirs ===
Cher&#x27;s first holiday album, &quot;Christmas&quot; (2023), features duets with Stevie Wonder, Darlene Love, Michael Bublé, Tyga and Cyndi Lauper. Its lead single, &quot;DJ Play a Christmas Song&quot;, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary and Dance/Electronic Digital Song Sales charts in December 2023, extending Cher&#x27;s record as the only solo artist with &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one singles in seven consecutive decades (1960s–2020s).
In December 2023, Cher criticized the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for excluding her since becoming eligible in 1990, saying, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be in it now if they gave me a million dollars,&quot; and suggesting the institution &quot;can just you-know-what themselves.&quot; Two months later, she received her first nomination and was inducted on October 19, 2024, becoming the first musician-actor to win an Academy Award for acting and join the Hall of Fame. Cher decided to accept the honor out of admiration for her fellow inductees. At the ceremony, she performed &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; and &quot;Believe&quot;, the latter as a duet with Dua Lipa.

In November 2024, Cher published &quot;&quot;, the first of a two-part autobiography covering her childhood, early career and marriages to Sonny Bono and Gregg Allman. Written over seven years, it debuted at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, holding the position for three weeks. The second part is set for release in 2025. To celebrate 60 years in music, Cher released the greatest hits album &quot;Forever&quot; (2024), available as a 21-track standard edition and a 40-track digital edition, &quot;Forever Fan&quot;, featuring Sonny &amp; Cher songs and lesser-known tracks curated by Cher. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted the absence of &quot;Half-Breed&quot;, her third &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one, linking it to a trend of artists reevaluating their catalogs in light of changing cultural sensitivities.

== Artistry ==
=== Music and voice ===
Cher has explored diverse musical styles, including rock (folk, punk, arena and pop subgenres), soul, jazz, disco, new wave, power ballads, hip hop and electronic dance music, aiming to &quot;remain relevant and do work that strikes a chord&quot;. Music historian Annie Zaleski wrote in Cher&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction essay that she sings &quot;nearly every style of music&quot; effortlessly. Cher&#x27;s music often centers on heartbreak, independence and women&#x27;s empowerment, making her a &quot;brokenhearted symbol of a strong but decidedly single woman&quot;, according to &quot;Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s Judy Wieder. &quot;Goldmine&quot;″s Phill Marder credits Cher&#x27;s musical success to her &quot;nearly flawless&quot; song selection, noting that while Sonny Bono contributed to early hits, most of her solo successes came from independent songwriters she chose. Her 2000 album &quot;Not Commercial&quot;, largely self-written, has a &quot;1970s singer-songwriter feel&quot; that highlights her storytelling skills, according to AllMusic&#x27;s Jose F. Promis.
Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writes, &quot;There were a lot of great records by female singers in the early days of rock ... None, however, reflected the authority and command that we associate with rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll today as much as [Cher&#x27;s] key early hits&quot;. Some of Cher&#x27;s early songs discuss subjects rarely addressed in American popular music such as divorce, prostitution, unplanned and underaged pregnancy, and racism. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Joe Viglione, the 1972 single &quot;The Way of Love&quot; is &quot;either about a woman expressing her love for another woman or a woman saying au revoir to a gay male she loved&quot;. Her ability to carry both male and female ranges allowed her to sing solo in androgynous and gender-neutral songs.

Cher&#x27;s contralto voice has been widely praised for its distinctiveness. Ann Powers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a quintessential rock voice: impure, quirky [and] a fine vehicle for projecting personality.&quot; Zaleski called her timbre &quot;recognizable, dusky and sultry, like exquisite black velvet,&quot; with a wide range and &quot;warbling&quot; vibrato. AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder stated that her voice&#x27;s &quot;intensity and passion&quot; are amplified by her acting skills, creating &quot;an incredibly powerful experience for the listener.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; Laura Snapes called her voice &quot;miraculous&quot;, capable of expressing &quot;vulnerability, vengeance and pain&quot; simultaneously. Zaleski added that her vocal delivery feels like &quot;a direct line to her soul&quot;, while author Paul Simpson observed that &quot;she spits out the words ... with such conviction you&#x27;d think she was delivering an eternal truth about the human condition&quot;.
Writing about Cher&#x27;s musical output during the 1960s, Hilburn stated that &quot;no one matched the pure, seductive wallop of Cher&quot;. By contrast, her vocal performances during the 1970s were described by Eder as &quot;dramatic, highly intense ... [and] almost as much &#x27;acted&#x27; as sung&quot;. First heard in the 1980 record &quot;Black Rose&quot;, Cher employed sharper, more aggressive vocals on her hard rock-oriented albums, establishing her sexually confident image. For the 1995 album &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot;, she restrained her vocals, singing in higher registers and without vibrato.

Cher&#x27;s 1998 song &quot;Believe&quot; was the first commercial recording to use Auto-Tune—an audio processor for correcting off-key vocals—as a stylistic effect, creating a robotic, futuristic sound. Cher, who proposed the effect, faced resistance from her label but insisted it remain, saying, &quot;You can change [the song] over my dead body&quot;. Dubbed the &quot;Cher effect&quot;, the technique was later described by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Simon Reynolds as having &quot;revolutionized the sound of popular music&quot; and as &quot;the sound of the 21st century.&quot; Cher used Auto-Tune extensively on &quot;Living Proof&quot; (2001) and subsequent albums. In 2023, the Cher Fan Club&#x27;s YouTube channel released a cover of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; using artificial intelligence (AI) to replicate Cher&#x27;s voice. Calling it &quot;shocking&quot;, Cher expressed concern: &quot;I&#x27;ve spent my entire life trying to be myself and now ... they&#x27;ll do my singing? ... it&#x27;s out of control.&quot;

=== Films, videos and stage ===
&quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine&#x27;s Barbara Wickens described Cher as &quot;probably the most fascinating movie star of her generation&quot;, highlighting her &quot;magnetic&quot; screen presence and her ability to be both &quot;boldly shocking&quot; and &quot;ultimately enigmatic.&quot; &quot;Film Comment&quot; stated, &quot;For Cher is a star. That is, she manages the movie star trick of being at once a character and at the same time never allowing you to forget: that&#x27;s Cher.&quot; &quot;New York Post&quot; critic David Edelstein attributed Cher&#x27;s &quot;top-ranking star quality&quot; to her capacity for projecting &quot;honesty, rawness and emotionality&quot;, adding that she &quot;wears her vulnerability on her sleeve.&quot; David Denby of &quot;New York&quot; magazine pointed to her distinctive appearance as a key factor in her appeal, describing her look as &quot;odd, a bit oriental and snaky&quot; and suggesting that it aligns with &quot;the traditional definition of a Hollywood star—that you always want to see more.&quot;

Author Yvonne Tasker notes that Cher&#x27;s film roles often mirror her public image as a rebellious, sexually autonomous and self-made woman. In her films, she recurrently serves as a social intermediary to marginalized male characters. Film critic Kathleen Rowe wrote of &quot;Moonstruck&quot; that the depiction of Cher&#x27;s character as &quot;a &#x27;woman on top&#x27; [is] enhanced by the unruly star persona Cher brings to the part&#x27;&quot;. For &quot;Moonstruck&quot;, Cher was ranked 1st on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Best Acting Performances by Musicians in Movies&quot; and her performance was described as &quot;the standard by which you mentally check all others&quot;. &quot;Moonstruck&quot; was acknowledged by the American Film Institute as the eighth best romantic comedy film of all time.
Cher&#x27;s public image is also reflected in her music videos and live performances, where she explores themes of self-construction, the pursuit of perfection and female sexuality, according to Tasker. Tony Spilde of &quot;The Bismarck Tribune&quot; felt that &quot;[Cher&#x27;s] lavish concerts have become bigger than the music they&#x27;re meant to promote.&quot; In her 1991 &quot;Cher... at the Mirage&quot; concert video, she stood apart from contemporary female pop singers by featuring a male dancer impersonating her instead of female backup dancers mirroring her movements. Author Diane Negra described this as Cher embracing her identity as a &quot;fictionalized production&quot;, offering audiences a &quot;pleasurable plurality.&quot; James Sullivan of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; highlighted Cher&#x27;s impact on the era of stadium-sized shows, stating, &quot;She&#x27;s comfortable enough to see such imitation as flattery, not theft.&quot;

Cher was ranked 17th on VH1&#x27;s list of the &quot;50 Greatest Women of the Video Era&quot;. The 1980 video for &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; involves cinematic techniques and was described by film historian Lawrence J. Quirk as one of the earliest examples of a modern music video. Deemed &quot;controversial&quot; for her performance on the battleship , straddling a cannon, and wearing a leather thong that revealed her tattooed buttocks, the 1989 music video for &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; was the first ever to be banned by MTV.

===Fashion icon status===

&quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Cady Lang described Cher as a &quot;cultural phenomenon [who] has forever changed the way we see celebrity fashion.&quot; Cher emerged as a fashion trendsetter in the 1960s, popularizing &quot;hippie fashion with bell-bottoms, bandanas and Cherokee-inspired tunics&quot;. She began working as a model in 1967 for photographer Richard Avedon after then-&quot;Vogue&quot; magazine editor Diana Vreeland discovered her at a party for Jacqueline Kennedy. Avedon took the controversial photo of Cher in a beaded and feathered nude gown designed by Bob Mackie for the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1975; &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Brooke Mazurek described it as &quot;one of the most recreated and monumental looks of all time.&quot; Cher first wore the gown to the 1974 Met Gala. According to &quot;Vogue&quot;″s André Leon Talley, &quot;it was really the first time a Hollywood celebrity attended and it changed everything. We are still seeing versions of that look on The Met red carpet 40 years later.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that Cher has &quot;transformed fashion and [become] one of the most influential style icons in red carpet history&quot;.

&quot;The Hamilton Spectator&quot; declared Cher &quot;the It Girl of the &#x27;70s&quot;. Through her television shows, she became a sex symbol with her inventive and revealing Mackie-designed outfits, and successfully fought the network censors to bare her navel. Cher has been erroneously identified as the first woman to expose her navel on television after the 1951 American Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters, and her frequent exposed midriff earned her the moniker &quot;pioneer of the belly beautiful&quot; from &quot;People&quot;. In 1972, after she was featured on the annual &quot;Best Dressed Women&quot; lists, Mackie stated: &quot;There hasn&#x27;t been a girl like Cher since Dietrich and Garbo. She&#x27;s a high-fashion star who appeals to people of all ages.&quot;

In May 1999, after the Council of Fashion Designers of America recognized Cher with an award for her influence on fashion, Robin Givhan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called her a &quot;fashion visionary&quot; for &quot;striking just the right note of contemporary wretched excess&quot;. Givhan referenced Tom Ford, Anna Sui and Dolce &amp; Gabbana as &quot;[i]nfluential designers [who] have evoked her name as a source of inspiration and guidance.&quot; She concluded that &quot;Cher&#x27;s Native American showgirl sexpot persona now seems to epitomize the fashion industry&#x27;s rush to celebrate ethnicity, adornment and sex appeal.&quot; &quot;Vogue&quot; proclaimed Cher &quot;[their] favorite fashion trendsetter&quot;, describing her as &quot;[e]ternally relevant [and] the ruler of outré reinvention&quot;. Alexander Fury of &quot;The Independent&quot; lauded Cher as &quot;the ultimate fashion icon&quot; and traced her influence among female celebrities such as Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian, stating that &quot;[t]hey all graduated from the Cher school of never sharing the stage, with anyone or anything ... They&#x27;re trying to share the spotlight, to have Cher&#x27;s success.&quot;

===Physical appearance===

Cher has attracted media attention for her physical appearance—particularly her youthful looks and her tattoos. Paddy Calistro of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that during Cher&#x27;s rise as a movie star in the 1980s, her &quot;highly articulated bone structure captured audience attention&quot;, which led to an increased number of medical requests for &quot;surgically inserted &#x27;cheekbones&#x27;&quot;. Journalists have often called Cher the &quot;poster girl&quot; of plastic surgery. Author Caroline Ramazanoglu wrote that &quot;Cher&#x27;s operations have gradually replaced a strong, decidedly &#x27;ethnic&#x27; look with a more symmetrical, delicate, &#x27;conventional&#x27; ... and ever-youthful version of female beauty ... Her normalised image ... now acts as a standard against which other women will measure, judge, discipline and &#x27;correct&#x27; themselves.&quot; In 1992, Madame Tussauds wax museum honored Cher as one of the five &quot;most beautiful women of history&quot; by creating a life-size statue. She was ranked 26th on VH1&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Sexiest Artists&quot; in 2002.

Cher has six tattoos. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; called her the &quot;Ms. Original Rose Tattoo&quot;. She got her first tattoo in 1972. According to Sonny Bono, &quot;Calling her butterfly tattoos nothing was like ignoring a sandstorm in the Mojave. That was exactly the effect Cher wanted to create. She liked to do things for the shock they created.&quot; In the late 1990s, she began having laser treatments to remove her tattoos. The process was still underway in the 2000s. She commented, &quot;When I got tattooed, only bad girls did it: me and Janis Joplin and biker chicks. Now it doesn&#x27;t mean anything. No one&#x27;s surprised.&quot;

Cher was the inspiration for Mother Gothel, a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; animated feature film &quot;Tangled &quot;(2010). Director Byron Howard stated that Gothel&#x27;s exotic appearance was based on Cher&#x27;s &quot;exotic and Gothic looking&quot; appearance, continuing that the singer &quot;definitely was one of the people we looked at visually, as far as what gives you a striking character&quot;.

===Social media presence===
Cher&#x27;s social media presence has been noted for its unconventional and candid style. &quot;Time&quot; named Cher &quot;Twitter&#x27;s most outspoken (and beloved) commentator&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ J Wortham highlighted her authenticity, contrasting it with the heavily curated online personas typical of celebrity accounts. Wortham described Cher as &quot;an outlier, perhaps the last unreconstructed high-profile Twitter user&quot;, whose posts combine &quot;nakedness and honesty&quot; that is &quot;rarely celebrated&quot; in mainstream culture. Similarly, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Monica Heisey described Cher&#x27;s Twitter account as &quot;a jewel in the bizarro crown of the internet&quot;, noting, &quot;While many celebrities use Twitter for carefully crafted self-promotion, Cher just lets it all hang out.&quot; Journalists have also remarked on her frequent use of emojis, which Cher has linked to her dyslexia, describing them as intuitive tools for visualizing emotions.

===Gay icon status===

Cher is revered by the LGBTQ community, a status attributed to her career accomplishments, distinctive sense of style and enduring longevity. She is regarded as a gay icon and is frequently imitated by drag queens. According to &quot;Salon&quot; writer Thomas Rogers, drag queens emulate figures like Judy Garland, Dolly Parton and Cher because they &quot;overcame insult and hardship on their path to success&quot;—narratives that resonate with the challenges many gay men face when coming out.

&quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; journalist Elio Iannacci stated that Cher was &quot;one of the first to bring drag to the masses&quot;, hiring two drag queens to perform with her during her Las Vegas residency in 1979. &quot;The Advocate&quot;″s Jeff Yarbrough described Cher as &quot;one of the first superstars to &#x27;play gay&#x27; with compassion and without a hint of stereotyping&quot;, as she portrays a lesbian in the 1983 film &quot;Silkwood&quot;. Cher&#x27;s transition to dance music and her social activism have further solidified her status as a gay icon. As the mother of a trans man, Chaz Bono, Cher has advocated for visibility and support for trans families.

Cher&#x27;s influence on LGBTQ culture was highlighted in the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, where she was the idol of the gay character Jack McFarland. She appeared as herself in two episodes, including the 2000 episode &quot;Gypsies, Tramps and Weed&quot;—referencing her 1971 song &quot;Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves&quot;—which became the show&#x27;s second-highest-rated episode. Cher&#x27;s impact on the drag community is also evident in the reality competition &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, which has honored Cher through challenges like the musical performance &quot;Cher: The Unauthorized Rusical&quot; in season 10 and the runway theme &quot;Everything Every-Cher All at Once&quot; in season 16.

== Activism ==
=== Philanthropy ===

Cher&#x27;s philanthropic work is channeled through the Cher Charitable Foundation, which focuses on combating poverty, advancing medical research, improving health care and supporting the rights of vulnerable groups such as veterans, children, LGBTQ individuals, elders and animals.

Cher has been a vocal advocate for American soldiers, returning veterans and communities affected by war. In 1993, she joined a humanitarian mission to Armenia, delivering food and medical supplies to the war-torn region. She has supported Operation Helmet, which provides free helmet upgrade kits to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and contributed to the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, aiding military personnel severely injured in war-related operations.

Beginning in 1990, Cher served as a donor and as the National Chairperson and Honorary Spokesperson for the Children&#x27;s Craniofacial Association, whose mission is to &quot;empower and give hope to facially disfigured children and their families&quot;. The annual Cher&#x27;s Family Retreat is held each June to provide craniofacial patients and their families an opportunity to interact with others with similar experiences. She supports the Get A-Head Charitable Trust, which aims to improve the quality of life for people with head and neck diseases.

Cher is a donor, fundraiser and international spokesperson for Keep a Child Alive, which seeks to combat AIDS, including providing antiretroviral medicine to children and their families. In 1996, she hosted the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) Benefit alongside Elizabeth Taylor at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2015, she received the amfAR Award of Inspiration for &quot;her willingness and ability to use her fame for the greater good&quot; and for being &quot;one of the great champions in the fight against AIDS&quot;.
Cher has served as the Honorary National Chair of Habitat for Humanity&#x27;s &quot;Raise the Roof&quot; fundraising initiative, aimed at supporting the construction and repair of affordable homes for families in need. In 2007, Cher became the primary supporter of the Peace Village School (PVS) in Ukunda, Kenya, which &quot;provides nutritious food, medical care, education and extracurricular activities for more than 300 orphans and vulnerable children.&quot; Her support enabled the school to acquire land and build permanent housing and school facilities and in partnership with Malaria No More and other organizations, she piloted an effort to eliminate malaria mortality and morbidity for the children, their caregivers and the surrounding community.

In 2016, after the discovery of lead contamination in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, Cher donated more than 180,000 bottles of water to the city. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cher launched the CherCares Pandemic Resource and Response Initiative (CCPRRI) alongside Dr. Irwin Redlener, the head of Columbia University&#x27;s Pandemic Resource and Response Center, to distribute $1 million to &quot;chronically neglected and forgotten people&quot; through the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF). Cher told &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;There are rural areas where people of color and Latinos and Native Americans were getting no services. It&#x27;s not a lot of money—$1 million goes in the blink of an eyelash!—so now I&#x27;m trying to get my friends to make it a lot more so we can do something that will really meet people&#x27;s needs.&quot;

In 2017, Cher weighed in on the need to protect elder rights as she executive produced &quot;Edith+Eddie&quot;, a documentary about a nonagenarian interracial couple, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject). That same year, she co-founded Free the Wild, an international charity dedicated to protecting wild animals in captivity. In 2020, Free the Wild partnered with Four Paws International, prompting Cher to travel to Pakistan to advocate for and work with the country&#x27;s government for the transfer of Kaavan, an elephant confined to a zoo for 35 years, to a wildlife sanctuary in Cambodia. This effort was chronicled in the documentary &quot;Cher &amp; the Loneliest Elephant&quot;, released on Paramount+ in 2021, which detailed her collaboration with animal aid groups and veterinarians to free Kaavan.

Cher&#x27;s older child, Chaz Bono, first came out as a lesbian at age 17, which reportedly caused Cher to feel &quot;guilt, fear and pain&quot;. However, she soon came to accept Chaz&#x27;s sexual orientation and came to the conclusion that LGBTQ people &quot;didn&#x27;t have the same rights as everyone else, [and she] thought that was unfair&quot;. Cher was the keynote speaker for the 1997 national Parents, Families, &amp; Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) convention and has since become one of the LGBTQ community&#x27;s most vocal advocates. In May 1998, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award for having &quot;made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for lesbians and gay men&quot;. On June 11, 2009, Chaz came out as a transgender man and his transition from female to male was legally finalized on May 6, 2010.

=== Politics ===

Cher has said that she is not a registered Democrat, but has attended many Democratic events. Her progressive political views have attracted media attention and she has been an outspoken critic of the conservative movement. She has commented that she did not understand why anyone would be a Republican because eight years under the administration of George W. Bush &quot;almost killed [her]&quot;.

During the 2000 United States presidential election, ABC News wrote that she was determined to do &quot;whatever possible to keep him [Bush] out of office&quot;. She said, &quot;If you&#x27;re black in this country, if you&#x27;re a woman in this country, if you are any minority in this country at all, what could possibly possess you to vote Republican? ... You won&#x27;t have one fucking right left.&quot; She added, &quot;I don&#x27;t like Bush. I don&#x27;t trust him. I don&#x27;t like his record. He&#x27;s stupid. He&#x27;s lazy.&quot;

On October 27, 2003, Cher anonymously called a C-SPAN phone-in program to recount a visit she made to maimed soldiers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and criticized the lack of media coverage and government attention given to injured servicemen. Although she identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate Ross Perot. She said: When I heard him talk right in the beginning, I thought that he would bring some sort of common-sense business approach and also less partisanship, but then ... I was completely disappointed like everyone else when he just kind of cut and run and no one knew exactly why ... Maybe he couldn&#x27;t have withstood all the investigation that goes on now.
In a 2006 &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; interview, Cher elaborated on her &quot;against the war in Iraq but for the troops&quot; position: &quot;I don&#x27;t have to be for this war to support the troops because these men and women do what ... they&#x27;re told to do ... They do the best they can. They don&#x27;t ask for anything.&quot;

Cher supported Hillary Clinton in her 2008 presidential campaign. After Obama won the Democratic nomination, she supported his candidacy. However, in a 2010 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, she commented that she &quot;still thinks Hillary would have done a better job&quot;, although she &quot;accepts the fact that Barack Obama inherited insurmountable problems&quot;. During the 2012 United States presidential election, Cher and comedian Kathy Griffin released a public service announcement titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Mitt Turn Back Time on Women&#x27;s Rights&quot;, criticizing Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for his support of Richard Mourdock, the US Senate candidate who suggested that pregnancies resulting from rape were &quot;part of God&#x27;s plan&quot;.

In September 2013, Cher declined an invitation to perform at the 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Russia due to the country&#x27;s controversial anti-LGBTQ legislation that overshadowed preparations for the event. In June 2015, after Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president, she made critical comments on Twitter, stating that &quot;Donald Trump&#x27;s punishment is being Donald Trump&quot;. In 2018, after the victory in Brazil&#x27;s presidential election of right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro, Cher called him a &quot;pig&quot; and &quot;a politician from hell&quot;, before declaring that Bolsonaro should be &quot;locked in prison for the rest of his life&quot;.
Cher has advocated for awareness of the Armenian Genocide. At the 2016 premiere of &quot;The Promise&quot;, a war film depicting the genocide, she criticized Turkey&#x27;s refusal to recognize the events as genocide and highlighted the general public&#x27;s lack of awareness. She referenced the Obersalzberg Speech and the line, &quot;Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?&quot; She also discussed her Armenian heritage and her grandparents&#x27; survival of the genocide. In 2021, she congratulated Joe Biden on Twitter for being the first US President to formally acknowledge the Armenian Genocide.

In September 2020, Cher raised nearly $2 million for Biden&#x27;s presidential campaign at a virtual, LGBTQ-themed fundraiser. In October, she traveled to Nevada and Arizona to campaign on behalf of Biden, and released a cover version of &quot;Happiness is Just a Thing Called Joe&quot;, a song conceived for the 1943 musical film &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;, with lyrics updated to be about Biden. The same month, Cher posted messages on Twitter in support of Armenia and Artsakh regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh war.

In 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Cher expressed her support for Ukraine and called for aid to Ukrainians through her Twitter account. She referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a despot intent on restoring the Soviet Union, and announced plans to provide shelter for Ukrainian refugees in her home.

== Legacy ==
Cher is commonly referred to by the media as the &quot;Goddess of Pop&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Rob Sheffield stated, &quot;there are no other careers remotely like hers, [particularly] in the history of pop music&quot;, and referred to Cher as &quot;the one-woman embodiment of the whole gaudy story of pop music.&quot; According to &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine&#x27;s Phill Marder, Cher &quot;has been and remains today one of the Rock Era&#x27;s most dominant figures&quot;. He described her as the leader of an effort in the 1960s to &quot;advance feminine rebellion in the rock world [and] the prototype of the female rock star ... the perfect female punk long before punk even was a rock term.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; Joe Lynch described Cher as &quot;a woman who pioneered an androgynous musical identity in the mid &#x27;60s&quot; and who by doing so &quot;teed things up for people like Bowie and Patti Smith&quot;.
&quot;Billboard&quot; Keith Caulfield wrote that &quot;there&#x27;s divas and then there&#x27;s Cher.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Matthew Schneier stated, &quot;[Cher] has earned her mononym. Her star power is such that she has spored an entire industry of imitators, both figurative and literal.&quot; &quot;Dazed&quot; magazine&#x27;s Shon Faye elaborates: &quot;If Madonna and Lady Gaga and Kylie and Cyndi Lauper were playing football, Cher would be the stadium they played on and the sun that shone down on them.&quot; According to Jeff Miers from &quot;The Buffalo News&quot;, &quot;Her music has changed with the times over the decades, rather than changing those times through groundbreaking work&quot;; however, he felt that subsequent female pop singers were heavily inspired by Cher&#x27;s abilities to combine &quot;showmanship with deep musicality ... to make valid statements in a wide variety of trend-driven idioms ... to ease effortlessly between pop subgenres [and] to shock without alienating her fans&quot;, as well as by her charismatic stage presence and the strong LGBTQ support among her fan base.

Cher has repeatedly reinvented herself by adopting a series of personas, for which Professor Richard Aquila from Ball State University called her &quot;the ultimate pop chameleon&quot;. According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Marc Snetiker, &quot;Cher has floated through generation after generation, scooping up new fans, thrilling old ones, reinventing her own myth and glittering splendidly through it all.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Brooke Mazurek credited Cher as having &quot;revolutionized the idea of what a pop star could visually accomplish, the way they could create multiple personas that live on and off-stage.&quot; James Reed from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; elaborates: &quot;Along with David Bowie, she is one of the original chameleons in pop music, constantly in flux and challenging our perceptions of her&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; declared Cher the &quot;Queen of the Comeback&quot;. According to author Lucy O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Cher adheres to the American Dream of reinvention of self: &#x27;Getting old does not have to mean getting obsolete.&#x27;&quot; Author Craig Crawford describes Cher as &quot;a model of flexible career management&quot; and relates her career successes to a constant reshaping of her image according to the evolving trends of popular culture. He further comments that she billed &quot;each dramatic turnaround of style as another example of rebellion—an image that allowed her to make calculated changes while appearing to be consistent.&quot;
Cher&#x27;s &quot;ability to forge an immensely successful and lengthy career as a woman in a male-dominated entertainment world&quot; has drawn attention from feminist critics. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Lauren Tom described Cher as &quot;a pioneer of female autonomy during a male-driven era [who] paved a way in a sexist industry with her music&quot;. According to author Diane Negra, Cher was presented in the beginning of her career as a product of male creativity; Cher remembers, &quot;It was a time when girl singers were patted on the head for being good and told not to think&quot;. However, her image eventually changed due to her &quot;refusal of dependence on a man and the determination not only to forge [an acting career] on her own terms but to refuse the conventional role assigned to women over forty years old in an industry that fetishises youth&quot;, wrote author Yvonne Tasker. She was featured in the 16th-anniversary edition of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine as an &quot;authentic feminist hero&quot; and a 1980s role model for women: &quot;Cher, the straightforward, tattooed, dyslexic single mother, the first Oscar winner to have entered into matrimony with a known heroin addict and to have admitted to being a fashion victim by choice, has finally landed in an era that&#x27;s not afraid to applaud real women.&quot;

Following Cher&#x27;s 1988 Oscar win, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Stephanie Brush highlighted her impact on women moviegoers, comparing her to Jack Nicholson for men. Brush wrote that Cher represents women in &quot;revenge fantasies&quot;, unapologetically telling off those who underestimate her, and concluded, &quot;You need to be more than beautiful to get away with this. You need to have been Cher for 40 years.&quot; Cher&#x27;s 1996 interview for &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;″s Jane Pauley became a viral video in 2016; in it, Cher tells the story of her mother asking her to &quot;settle down and marry a rich man&quot;, to which Cher replies, &quot;Mom, I am a rich man.&quot; Cher&#x27;s &quot;Mom, I am a rich man&quot; quote was included in Taylor Swift&#x27;s 2019 music video &quot;You Need to Calm Down&quot;. &quot;Bustle&quot; magazine&#x27;s Erica Kam commented, &quot;[Cher&#x27;s quote] puts a spin on typical gender norms ... It would make sense, then, that Swift would want to follow Cher&#x27;s example.&quot;

Alec Mapa of &quot;The Advocate&quot; elaborates: &quot;While the rest of us were sleeping, Cher&#x27;s been out there for the last four decades living out every single one of our childhood fantasies ... Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Jancee Dunn wrote, &quot;Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, &#x27;I don&#x27;t give a shit what you think, I&#x27;m going to wear this multicolored wig.&#x27; There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us.&quot; Alexander Fury of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote that Cher &quot;represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame.&quot; Bego stated: &quot;No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher&#x27;s. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation and the subject of a mountain of press coverage.&quot; Lynch wrote that &quot;the world would certainly be different if she hadn&#x27;t stayed so irrevocably Cher from the start.&quot;

== Achievements ==

As a solo artist, Cher has sold 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She is among the few entertainers to have won an Emmy, Grammy and Oscar, and one of five actor-singers to have had a US number-one single and won an acting Academy Award. Her breakthrough single, Sonny &amp; Cher&#x27;s &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;, is a Grammy Hall of Fame inductee and was featured on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list in 2003. Her 1971 single &quot;Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves&quot; was called &quot;one of the 20th century&#x27;s greatest songs&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;. Her 1998 song &quot;Believe&quot; is the biggest-selling single of all time by a female artist in the UK. It was voted the world&#x27;s eighth favorite song in a poll conducted by BBC in 2003—the only American song on the list. &quot;Believe&quot; appeared on the 2021 revised list of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 1988, Cher became the first performer to receive an Academy Award for acting and a RIAA-certified gold album in the same year.

Cher is the only solo artist to have a number-one single on a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in seven consecutive decades, from the 1960s to the 2020s. She held the previous US record for &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles over the longest period of time: 33 years, seven months and three weeks between &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;, which topped the chart for the first time on August 14, 1965, and &quot;Believe&quot;, whose last week at number one was April 3, 1999. With &quot;Believe&quot;, she became the oldest female artist at the time to have a US number-one song in the rock era, at the age of 52. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her at number 43 on their &quot;Greatest Hot 100 Artists of All Time&quot; list. In 2014, the magazine listed her as the 23rd highest-grossing touring act since 1990, with total earned revenue of $351.6 million and 4.5 million attendance.
Cher has received numerous lifetime achievement awards, including the Vanguard Award at the 1998 GLAAD Media Awards, the Legend Award at the 1999 World Music Awards, a special award for influence on fashion at the 1999 CFDA Fashion Awards, the Lucy Award for Innovation in Television at the 2000 Women in Film Awards, the Artist Achievement Award at the 2002 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2010 &quot;Glamour&quot; Awards, the Legend Award at the 2013 &quot;Attitude&quot; Awards, the Award of Inspiration at the 2015 amfAR Gala, the Icon Award at the 2017 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, the Ambassador for the Arts Award at the 2019 Chita Rivera Awards for Dance and Choreography, and the 2020 Spirit of Katharine Hepburn Award.

In 2010, Cher received the honor of placing her handprints and footprints in cement in front of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Her name is on a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as part of the duo Sonny &amp; Cher. She had also been selected for the honor as a solo artist in 1983, but declined to schedule the mandatory personal appearance. In 2018, Whoopi Goldberg presented her Kennedy Center Honor, the highest recognition of cultural achievement in the US. In 2024, Cher was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In 2003, Cher appeared at number 41 on VH1&#x27;s list of &quot;The 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons&quot;, which recognizes &quot;the folks that have significantly inspired and impacted American society&quot;. She was ranked 31st on VH1&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Women in Music&quot; for the period 1992–2012. &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine placed her at number 44 on their list of &quot;The 75 Greatest Women of All Time&quot;. She was featured on the &quot;100 Greatest Movie Stars of our Time&quot; list compiled by &quot;People&quot;. In a 2001 poll, &quot;Biography&quot; magazine ranked her as their third favorite leading actress of all time.

<text>Cher ( ; ; Berrichon: &quot;Char&quot;) is a department in central France, part of the Centre-Val de Loire region. Named after the river Cher, its prefecture is Bourges. In 2019, it had a population of 302,306.

==History==
Cher is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. Most of it was created, along with the adjacent department of Indre from the former province of Berry. The southeastern corner of the department, however, was part of the Duchy of Bourbon.

==Geography==
The department is part of the current administrative region of Centre-Val de Loire. It is surrounded by the departments of Indre, Loir-et-Cher, Loiret, Nièvre, Allier, and Creuse.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Bourges, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 8 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==

The inhabitants of the department are called &quot;Chériens&quot; or &quot;Berrichons&quot; after the former province of Berry.
==Politics==

The President of the General Council is Jacques Fleury of The Republicans, elected in July 2021.

===Current National Assembly representatives===

==Tourism==
The Bourges Cathedral of St. Étienne is a major tourist attraction.
==Languages==
The historical languages are Berrichon and the northern version of Bourbonnais. These are both dialects of French, or the Langues d&#x27;oïl. They are named respectively after the former Province of Berry and the former Duchy of Bourbon. 
Some 11 communes in the extreme South used to speak Occitan.

The old dialects were in widespread use until the middle decades of the twentieth century and incorporated major regional variations within the department, influenced by the dialects of adjacent regions near the departmental frontiers. During the twentieth century government educational policy promoted a more standardised version of the French language.

In the extreme south of the department influence from the southern Occitan language begins to appear, with &quot;chambrat&quot; being used in place of &quot;grenier a foin&quot; (hayloft), &quot;betoulle&quot; in place of &quot;bouleau&quot; (birch tree) and &quot;aigue&quot; in place of &quot;eau&quot; (water).

<text>In Norse mythology, Vár or Vór (Old Norse, meaning either &quot;pledge&quot; or &quot;beloved&quot;) is a goddess associated with oaths and agreements. Vár is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and kennings found in skaldic poetry and a runic inscription. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.

==Attestations==
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, the blessing of Vár is invoked by the jötunn Þrymr after his &quot;bride&quot; (who is actually the god Thor disguised as the goddess Freyja) is hallowed with the stolen hammer of Thor, Mjöllnir, at their wedding:


In the chapter 35 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High tells Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) about the ásynjur. High lists Vár ninth among the sixteen ásynjur he presents in the chapter and provides some information about her:

Ninth Var: she listens to people&#x27;s oaths and private agreements that women and men make between each other. Thus these contracts are called &quot;varar&quot;. She also punishes those who break them.

In addition, Vár appears twice more in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. In chapter 75 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; Vár appears within a list of 27 ásynjur names. In chapter 87 the name &quot;Vár&quot; is employed in a kenning referring to the goddess Skaði (&quot;bow-string-Vár&quot;) in the poem &quot;Haustlöng&quot; by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir. A runic inscription inscribed on a stick from Bergen, Norway around the year 1300 records a common mercantile transaction followed by a verse from a displeased scribe that mentions Vár (edits applied per the translator&#x27;s notes):

:&#x27;Wise Var of wire [&quot;woman of filigree,&quot; meaning &quot;wise bejeweled woman&quot;] makes (me) sit unhappy.
:Eir [woman] of mackerels&#x27; ground [likely gold] takes often and much sleep from me.&#x27;

Mindy Macleod and Bernard Mees posit that the first line of the inscription essentially means &quot;women make me miserable&quot; or potentially &quot;marriage makes me miserable,&quot; whereas the second line means &quot;women often take a lot of sleep from me.&quot;

==Theories==
Regarding the ceremonial marital reference to Vár in &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, Andy Orchard opines that &quot;the antiquity of such a ritual is far from clear.&quot; Britt-Mari Näsström argues that, like many other minor goddesses, Vár was originally one of Freyja&#x27;s names, &quot;later apprehended as independent goddesses.&quot;

Rudolf Simek says that the goddesses Sága, Hlín, Sjöfn, Snotra, Vár, and Vör should be considered vaguely defined figures who &quot;should be seen as female protective goddesses&quot; that are all responsible for &quot;specific areas of the private sphere, and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to matrons.&quot;

<text>Mató () is a fresh cheese of Catalonia made from sheep&#x27; or goats&#x27; milk, with no salt added. 

It is usually served with honey, as a traditional and emblematic Catalan dessert known as .

==Description and origin==
Mató is a whey cheese similar to non-industrial variants of the fresh cheeses known as &quot;Brull&quot; in Maestrat, Ports de Beseit and the Southern Terres de l&#x27;Ebre and as &quot;Brossat&quot; in Andorra, Pallars, Menorca, Mallorca and parts of Occitania, as well as the &quot;brocciu&quot; in Corsica and other types of curd cheese such as Italian ricotta.

The Mató from the villages near the Montserrat mountain, such as Ullastrell and Marganell, is quite famous. 

Mató is mentioned in the , a 14th-century Catalan cookbook, as well as in the &quot;El Noi de la Mare&quot; local Christmas carol. It was very popular during the Middle Ages, when it was made plain or scented with orange flowers.

It is made by hand by boiling the milk and coagulating it with a vegetable element such as the thistle flower (&quot;Cynara cardunculus&quot;), lemon juice or an animal element (rennet). The resulting product is filtered through a cloth in wicker or cane containers. A white, slightly sweet pasty mass is thus obtained due to the effect of the concentration of lactose in the milk.

Industrial manufacturing uses the same physical-chemical principle but pasteurized milk and large-capacity stainless steel tanks are used.

Mató is consumed as a dessert. It can be sprinkled with sugar, although the most traditional way is the one that uses honey to sweeten it. It is also used in some preparations such as cottage cheese cake (&quot;Greixonera de Brossat&quot;), as well as the preparation of a cake such as coca de brossat (&quot;coc de brossat&quot;).

<text>The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) is an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group based in Northern Ireland. Formed in 1965, it first emerged in 1966. Its first leader was Gusty Spence, a former Royal Ulster Rifles soldier from Northern Ireland. The group undertook an armed campaign of almost thirty years during The Troubles. It declared a ceasefire in 1994 and officially ended its campaign in 2007, although some of its members have continued to engage in violence and criminal activities. The group is a proscribed organisation and is on the terrorist organisation list of the United Kingdom.

The UVF&#x27;s declared goals were to combat Irish republican paramilitaries – particularly the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) – and to maintain Northern Ireland&#x27;s status as part of the United Kingdom. It was responsible for more than 500 deaths. The vast majority (more than two-thirds) of its victims were Irish Catholic civilians, who were often killed at random. During the conflict, its deadliest attack in Northern Ireland was the 1971 McGurk&#x27;s Bar bombing, which killed fifteen civilians. The group also carried out attacks in the Republic of Ireland from 1969 onward. The biggest of these was the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which killed 34 civilians, making it the deadliest terrorist attack of the conflict. The no-warning car bombings had been carried out by units from the Belfast and Mid-Ulster brigades.

The Mid-Ulster Brigade was also responsible for the 1975 Miami Showband killings, in which three members of the popular Irish cabaret band were shot dead at a bogus security checkpoint by gunmen wearing military uniforms. Two UVF men were accidentally blown up in this attack. The UVF&#x27;s last major attack was the 1994 Loughinisland massacre, in which its members shot dead six Catholic civilians in a rural pub. Until recent years, it was noted for secrecy and a policy of limited, selective membership.

Since the ceasefire, the UVF has been involved in rioting, drug dealing, organised crime, loan-sharking and prostitution. Some members have also been found responsible for orchestrating a series of racist attacks.

==History==
===Background===
Since 1964 and the formation of the Campaign for Social Justice, there had been a growing civil rights campaign in Northern Ireland, seeking to highlight discrimination against Catholics by the unionist government of Northern Ireland. Some unionists feared Irish nationalism and launched an opposing response in Northern Ireland. In April 1966, Ulster loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant fundamentalist preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC). It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV). The &#x27;Paisleyites&#x27; set out to stymie the civil rights movement and oust Terence O&#x27;Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Although O&#x27;Neill was a unionist, they saw him as being too &#x27;soft&#x27; on the civil rights movement and too friendly with the Republic of Ireland. There was to be much overlap in membership between the UCDC/UPV and the UVF.

===Beginnings===

On 7 May 1966, loyalists petrol bombed a Catholic-owned pub in the loyalist Shankill area of Belfast. Fire engulfed the house next door, badly burning the elderly Protestant widow who lived there. She died of her injuries on 27 June. The group called itself the &quot;Ulster Volunteer Force&quot; (UVF), after the Ulster Volunteers of the early 20th century, although in the words of a member of the previous organisation &quot;the present para-military organisation ... has no connection with the U.V.F. of which I have been speaking. Though, for its own purposes, it assumed the same name it has nothing else in common.&quot; It was led by Gusty Spence, a former Royal Ulster Rifles soldier from Northern Ireland. Spence claimed that he was approached in 1965 by two men, one of whom was an Ulster Unionist Party MP, who told him that the UVF was to be re-established and that he was to have responsibility for the Shankill. On 21 May, the group issued a statement:From this day, we declare war against the Irish Republican Army and its splinter groups. Known IRA men will be executed mercilessly and without hesitation. Less extreme measures will be taken against anyone sheltering or helping them, but if they persist in giving them aid, then more extreme methods will be adopted. ... we solemnly warn the authorities to make no more speeches of appeasement. We are heavily armed Protestants dedicated to this cause.

On 27 May, Spence sent four UVF members to kill IRA volunteer Leo Martin, who lived in Belfast. Unable to find their target, the men drove around the Falls district in search of a Catholic. They shot John Scullion, a Catholic civilian, as he walked home. He died of his wounds on 11 June. Spence later wrote &quot;At the time, the attitude was that if you couldn&#x27;t get an IRA man you should shoot a Taig, he&#x27;s your last resort&quot;.

On 26 June, the group shot dead a Catholic civilian and wounded two others as they left a pub on Malvern Street, Belfast. Two days later, the Government of Northern Ireland declared the UVF illegal. The shootings led to Spence&#x27;s being sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum sentence of twenty years. Spence appointed Samuel McClelland as UVF Chief of Staff in his stead.

===Violence escalates===
By 1969, the Catholic civil rights movement had escalated its protest campaign, and O&#x27;Neill had promised them some concessions. In March and April that year, UVF and UPV members bombed water and electricity installations in Northern Ireland, blaming them on the dormant IRA and elements of the civil rights movement. Some of them left much of Belfast without power and water. The loyalists &quot;intended to force a crisis which would so undermine confidence in O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s ability to maintain law and order that he would be obliged to resign&quot;. There were bombings on 30 March, 4 April, 20 April, 24 April and 26 April. All were widely blamed on the IRA, and British troops were sent to guard installations. Unionist support for O&#x27;Neill waned, and on 28 April he resigned as Prime Minister.

On 12 August 1969, the &quot;Battle of the Bogside&quot; began in Derry. This was a large, three-day riot between Irish nationalists and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). In response to events in Derry, nationalists held protests throughout Northern Ireland, some of which became violent. In Belfast, loyalists responded by attacking nationalist districts. Eight people were shot dead and hundreds were injured. Scores of houses and businesses were burnt out, most of them owned by Catholics. In response, the British Army was deployed on the streets of Northern Ireland and Irish Army units set up field hospitals near the border. Thousands of families, mostly Catholics, were forced to flee their homes and refugee camps were set up in the Republic of Ireland.

On 12 October, a loyalist protest in the Shankill became violent. During the riot, UVF members shot dead RUC officer Victor Arbuckle. He was the first RUC officer to be killed during the Troubles.

The UVF had launched its first attack in the Republic of Ireland on 5 August 1969, when it bombed the RTÉ Television Centre in Dublin. There were further attacks in the Republic between October and December 1969. In October, UVF and UPV member Thomas McDowell was killed by the bomb he was planting at Ballyshannon power station. The UVF stated that the attempted attack was a protest against the Irish Army units &quot;still massed on the border in County Donegal&quot;. In December, the UVF detonated a car bomb near the Garda central detective bureau and telephone exchange headquarters in Dublin.

===Early to mid-1970s===
In January 1970, the UVF began bombing Catholic-owned businesses in Protestant areas of Belfast. It issued a statement vowing to &quot;remove republican elements from loyalist areas&quot; and stop them &quot;reaping financial benefit therefrom&quot;. During 1970, 42 Catholic-owned licensed premises in Protestant areas were bombed. Catholic churches were also attacked. In February, it began to target critics of militant loyalism – the homes of MPs Austin Currie, Sheelagh Murnaghan, Richard Ferguson and Anne Dickson were attacked with improvised bombs. It also continued its attacks in the Republic of Ireland, bombing the Dublin-Belfast railway line, an electricity substation, a radio mast, and Irish nationalist monuments.

The IRA had split into the Provisional IRA and Official IRA in December 1969. In 1971, these ramped up their activity against the British Army and RUC. The first British soldier to be killed by the Provisional IRA died in February 1971. That year, a string of tit-for-tat pub bombings began in Belfast. This came to a climax on 4 December, when the UVF bombed McGurk&#x27;s Bar, a Catholic-owned pub in Belfast. Fifteen Catholic civilians were killed and seventeen wounded. It was the UVF&#x27;s deadliest attack in Northern Ireland, and the deadliest attack in Belfast during the Troubles.

The following year, 1972, was the most violent of the Troubles. Along with the newly formed Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the UVF started an armed campaign against the Catholic population of Northern Ireland. It began carrying out gun attacks to kill random Catholic civilians and using car bombs to attack Catholic-owned pubs. It would continue these tactics for the rest of its campaign. On 23 October 1972, the UVF carried out an armed raid against King&#x27;s Park camp, a UDR/Territorial Army depot in Lurgan. They managed to procure a large cache of weapons and ammunition including L1A1 Self-Loading Rifles, Browning pistols, and Sterling submachine guns. Twenty tons of ammonium nitrate was also stolen from the Belfast docks.

The UVF launched further attacks in the Republic of Ireland during December 1972 and January 1973, when it detonated three car bombs in Dublin and one in Belturbet, County Cavan, killing a total of five civilians. It would attack the Republic again in May 1974, during the two-week Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike. This was a general strike in protest against the Sunningdale Agreement, which meant sharing political power with Irish nationalists and the Republic having more involvement in Northern Ireland. Along with the UDA, it helped to enforce the strike by blocking roads, intimidating workers, and shutting any businesses that opened. On 17 May, two UVF units from the Belfast and Mid-Ulster brigades detonated four car bombs in Dublin and Monaghan. Thirty-three people were killed and almost 300 injured. It was the deadliest attack of the Troubles. There are various allegations that elements of the British security forces colluded with the UVF in the bombings. The Irish parliament&#x27;s Joint Committee on Justice called the bombings an act of &quot;international terrorism&quot; involving members of the British security forces. Both the UVF and the British government have denied the claims.

The UVF&#x27;s Mid-Ulster Brigade was founded in 1972 in Lurgan by Billy Hanna, a sergeant in the UDR and a member of the Brigade Staff, who served as the brigade&#x27;s commander, until he was shot dead in July 1975. From that time until the early 1990s the Mid-Ulster Brigade was led by Robin &quot;the Jackal&quot; Jackson, who then passed the leadership to Billy Wright. Hanna and Jackson have both been implicated by journalist Joe Tiernan and RUC Special Patrol Group (SPG) officer John Weir as having led one of the units that bombed Dublin. Jackson was allegedly the hitman who shot Hanna dead outside his home in Lurgan.

The brigade formed part of the Glenanne gang, a loose alliance of loyalists which the Pat Finucane Centre (PFC) has linked to 87 killings in the 1970s. The gang comprised, in addition to members the UVF, rogue elements of the UDR and RUC, all of which were allegedly acting under the direction of the Intelligence Corps and/or the RUC Special Branch according to the PFC.

===Mid- to late 1970s===

In 1974, hardliners staged a coup and took over the Brigade Staff. This resulted in a sharp increase in sectarian killings and internecine feuding, both with the UDA and within the UVF itself. Some of the new Brigade Staff members bore nicknames such as &quot;Big Dog&quot; and &quot;Smudger&quot;. Beginning in 1975, recruitment to the UVF, which until then had been solely by invitation, was now left to the discretion of local units.

The UVF&#x27;s Mid-Ulster Brigade carried out further attacks during this same period. These included the Miami Showband killings of 31 July 1975 – when three members of the popular showband were killed, having been stopped at a fake British Army checkpoint outside Newry in County Down. Two members of the group survived the attack and later testified against those responsible. Two UVF members, Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville, were accidentally killed by their own bomb while carrying out this attack. Two of those later convicted (James McDowell and Thomas Crozier) were also serving members of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), a regular Army regiment consisting of Northern Irish reservists.

From late 1975 to mid-1977, a unit of the UVF dubbed the Shankill Butchers (a group of UVF men based on Belfast&#x27;s Shankill Road) carried out a series of sectarian murders of Catholic civilians. Six of the victims were abducted at random, then beaten and tortured before having their throats slashed. This gang was led by Lenny Murphy. He was shot dead by the IRA in November 1982, four months after his release from the Maze Prison.

The group had been proscribed in July 1966, but this ban was lifted on 4 April 1974 by Merlyn Rees, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in an effort to bring the UVF into the democratic process. A political wing was formed in June 1974, the Volunteer Political Party led by UVF Chief of Staff Ken Gibson, which contested West Belfast in the October 1974 general election, polling 2,690 votes (6%). However, the UVF spurned the government efforts and continued killing. Colin Wallace, a member of the Intelligence Corps, asserted in an internal memo in 1975 that MI6 and RUC Special Branch formed a pseudo-gang within the UVF, designed to engage in violence and to subvert the tentative moves of some in the UVF towards the political process. Captain Robert Nairac of 14 Intelligence Company was alleged to have been involved in several UVF operations. The UVF was banned again on 3 October 1975 and two days later twenty-six suspected UVF members were arrested in a series of raids. The men were tried, and in March 1977 were sentenced to an average of twenty-five years each.

In October 1975, after staging a counter-coup, the Brigade Staff acquired a new leadership of moderates with Tommy West serving as the Chief of Staff. These men had overthrown the &quot;hawkish&quot; officers, who had called for a &quot;big push&quot;, which meant an increase in violent attacks, earlier in the same month. The UVF was behind the deaths of seven civilians in a series of attacks on 2 October. The hawks had been ousted by those in the UVF who were unhappy with their political and military strategy. The new Brigade Staff&#x27;s aim was to carry out attacks against known republicans rather than Catholic civilians. This was endorsed by Gusty Spence, who issued a statement asking all UVF volunteers to support the new regime. The UVF&#x27;s activities in the last years of the decade were increasingly being curtailed by the number of UVF members who were sent to prison. The number of killings in Northern Ireland had decreased from around 300 per year between 1973 and 1976 to just under 100 in the years 1977–1981. In 1976, Tommy West was replaced with &quot;Mr. F&quot; who is alleged to be John &quot;Bunter&quot; Graham, who remains the incumbent Chief of Staff to date. West died in 1980.

On 17 February 1979, the UVF carried out its only major attack in Scotland, when its members bombed two pubs in Glasgow frequented by Irish-Scots Catholics. Both pubs were wrecked and a number of people were wounded. It claimed the pubs were used for republican fundraising. In June, nine UVF members were convicted of the attacks.

===Early to mid-1980s===
In the 1980s, the UVF was greatly reduced by a series of police informers. The damage from security service informers started in 1983 with &quot;supergrass&quot; Joseph Bennett&#x27;s information, which led to the arrest of fourteen senior figures. In 1984, the UVF attempted to kill the northern editor of the &quot;Sunday World&quot;, Jim Campbell after he had exposed the paramilitary activities of Mid-Ulster brigadier Robin Jackson. Another loyalist paramilitary organisation called Ulster Resistance was formed on 10 November 1986. The initial aim of Ulster Resistance was to bring an end to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Loyalists were successful in importing arms into Northern Ireland. The weapons were Palestine Liberation Organisation arms captured by the Israelis and sold to Armscor, the South African state-owned company which, in defiance of a 1977 United Nations arms embargo, set about making South Africa self-sufficient in military hardware. The arms were divided between the UVF, the UDA (the largest loyalist group) and Ulster Resistance.

The arms are thought to have consisted of:

*200 Czechoslovak Sa vz. 58 automatic rifles,
*90 Browning pistols,
*500 RGD-5 fragmentation grenades,
*30,000 rounds of ammunition and
*12 RPG-7 rocket launchers and 150 warheads.

The UVF used this new infusion of arms to escalate their campaign of sectarian assassinations. This era also saw a more widespread targeting on the UVF&#x27;s part of IRA and Sinn Féin members, beginning with the killing of senior IRA member Larry Marley and a failed attempt on the life of a leading republican which left three Catholic civilians dead.

===Late 1980s and early 1990s===
The UVF also attacked republican paramilitaries and political activists. These attacks were stepped up in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly in the east Tyrone and north Armagh areas. The largest death toll in a single attack was in the 3 March 1991 Cappagh killings, when the UVF killed IRA members John Quinn, Dwayne O&#x27;Donnell and Malcolm Nugent, and civilian Thomas Armstrong in the small village of Cappagh. Republicans responded to the attacks by assassinating senior UVF members John Bingham, William &quot;Frenchie&quot; Marchant and Trevor King as well as Leslie Dallas, whose purported UVF membership was disputed both by his family and the UVF. The UVF also killed senior IRA paramilitary members Liam Ryan, John &#x27;Skipper&#x27; Burns and Larry Marley. According to Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), the UVF killed 17 active and four former republican paramilitaries. CAIN also states that republicans killed 15 UVF members, some of whom are suspected to have been set up for assassination by their colleagues.

According to journalist and author Ed Moloney, the UVF campaign in Mid-Ulster in this period &quot;indisputably shattered Republican morale&quot;, and put the leadership of the republican movement under intense pressure to &quot;do something&quot;, although this has been disputed by others.

===1994 ceasefire===
In 1990, the UVF joined the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) and indicated its acceptance of moves towards peace. However, the year leading up to the loyalist ceasefire, which took place shortly after the Provisional IRA ceasefire, saw some of the worst sectarian killings carried out by loyalists during the Troubles. On 18 June 1994, UVF members machine-gunned a pub in the Loughinisland massacre in County Down, on the basis that its customers were watching the Republic of Ireland national football team playing in the World Cup on television and were therefore assumed to be Catholics. The gunmen shot dead six people and injured five.

The UVF agreed to a ceasefire in October 1994.

===Post-ceasefire activities===

====1994–2005====
More militant members of the UVF who disagreed with the ceasefire, broke away to form the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), led by Billy Wright. This development came soon after the UVF&#x27;s Brigade Staff in Belfast had stood down Wright and the Portadown unit of the Mid-Ulster Brigade, on 2 August 1996, for the killing of a Catholic taxi driver near Lurgan during Drumcree disturbances.

There followed years of violence between the two organisations. In January 2000 UVF Mid-Ulster brigadier Richard Jameson was shot dead by a LVF gunman which led to an escalation of the UVF/LVF feud. The UVF was also clashing with the UDA in the summer of 2000. The feud with the UDA ended in December following seven deaths. Veteran anti-UVF campaigner Raymond McCord, whose son, Raymond Jr., a Protestant, was beaten to death by UVF men in 1997, estimates the UVF has killed more than thirty people since its 1994 ceasefire, most of them Protestants. The feud between the UVF and the LVF erupted again in the summer of 2005. The UVF killed four men in Belfast and trouble ended only when the LVF announced that it was disbanding in October of that year.

On 14 September 2005, following serious loyalist rioting during which dozens of shots were fired at riot police and the British Army, the Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain announced that the British government no longer recognised the UVF ceasefire.

====2006–2010====
On 12 February 2006, &quot;The Observer&quot; reported that the UVF was to disband by the end of 2006. The newspaper also reported that the group refused to decommission its weapons.

On 2 September 2006, BBC News reported the UVF might be intending to re-enter dialogue with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, with a view to decommissioning of their weapons. This move came as the organisation held high-level discussions about its future.

On 3 May 2007, following recent negotiations between the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) and Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and with Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde, the UVF made a statement that they would transform to a &quot;non-military, civilianised&quot; organisation. This was to take effect from midnight. They also stated that they would retain their weaponry but put them beyond reach of normal volunteers. Their weapons stock-piles are to be retained under the watch of the UVF leadership.

In January 2008, the UVF was accused of involvement in vigilante action against alleged criminals in Belfast.

In 2008, a loyalist splinter group calling itself the &quot;Real UVF&quot; emerged briefly to make threats against Sinn Féin in County Fermanagh.

In the twentieth IMC report, the group was said to be continuing to put its weapons &quot;beyond reach&quot;, (in the group&#x27;s own words) to downsize, and reduce the criminality of the group. The report added that individuals, some current and some former members, in the group have, without the orders from above, continued with &quot;localised recruitment&quot;, and although some continued to try and acquire weapons, including a senior member, most forms of crime had fallen, including shootings and assaults. The group concluded a general acceptance of the need to decommission, though there was no conclusive proof of moves towards this end.

In June 2009 the UVF formally decommissioned their weapons in front of independent witnesses as a formal statement of decommissioning was read by Dawn Purvis and Billy Hutchinson. The IICD confirmed that &quot;substantial quantities of firearms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices&quot; had been decommissioned and that for the UVF and RHC, decommissioning had been completed.

====2010–2019====
The UVF was blamed for the shotgun killing of expelled RHC member Bobby Moffett on the Shankill Road on the afternoon of 28 May 2010, in front of passers-by including children. The Independent Monitoring Commission stated Moffett was killed by UVF members acting with the sanction of the leadership. The Progressive Unionist Party&#x27;s condemnation, and Dawn Purvis and other leaders&#x27; resignations as a response to the Moffett shooting, were also noted. Eleven months later, a man was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of the UVF&#x27;s alleged second-in-command Harry Stockman, described by the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; as a &quot;senior Loyalist figure&quot;. Fifty-year-old Stockman was stabbed more than 10 times in a supermarket in Belfast; the attack was believed to have been linked to the Moffett killing.

On 25–26 October 2010, the UVF was involved in rioting and disturbances in the Rathcoole area of Newtownabbey with UVF gunmen seen on the streets at the time.

On the night of 20 June 2011, riots involving 500 people erupted in the Short Strand area of East Belfast. They were blamed by the PSNI on members of the UVF, who also said UVF guns had been used to try to kill police officers. The UVF leader in East Belfast, who is popularly known as the &quot;Beast of the East&quot; and &quot;Ugly Doris&quot; also known as by real name Stephen Matthews, ordered the attack on Catholic homes and a church in the Catholic enclave of the Short Strand. This was in retaliation for attacks on Loyalist homes the previous weekend and after a young girl was hit in the face with a brick by Republicans. A dissident Republican was arrested for &quot;the attempted murder of police officers in east Belfast&quot; after shots were fired upon the police.

In July 2011, a UVF flag flying in Limavady was deemed legal by the PSNI after the police had received complaints about the flag from nationalist politicians.

During the Belfast City Hall flag protests of 2012–13, senior UVF members were confirmed to have actively been involved in orchestrating violence and rioting against the PSNI and the Alliance Party throughout Northern Ireland during the weeks of disorder. Much of the UVF&#x27;s orchestration was carried out by its senior members in East Belfast, where many attacks on the PSNI and on residents of the Short Strand enclave took place. There were also reports that UVF members fired shots at police lines during a protest. The high levels of orchestration by the leadership of the East Belfast UVF, and the alleged ignored orders from the main leaders of the UVF to stop the violence has led to fears that the East Belfast UVF has now become a separate loyalist paramilitary grouping which doesn&#x27;t abide by the UVF ceasefire or the Northern Ireland Peace Process.

In October 2013, the policing board announced that the UVF was still heavily involved in gangsterism despite its ceasefire. Assistant chief constable Drew Harris in a statement said &quot;The UVF are subject to an organised crime investigation as an organised crime group. The UVF very clearly have involvement in drug dealing, all forms of gangsterism, serious assaults, intimidation of the community.&quot;

In November 2013, after a series of shootings and acts of intimidation by the UVF, Police Federation Chairman Terry Spence declared that the UVF ceasefire was no longer active. Spence told Radio Ulster that the UVF had been &quot;engaged in murder, attempted murder of civilians, attempted murder of police officers. They have been engaged in orchestrating violence on our streets, and it&#x27;s very clear to me that they are engaged in an array of mafia-style activities. &quot;They are holding local communities to ransom. On the basis of that, we as a federation have called for the respecification of the UVF [stating that its ceasefire is over].&quot;

In June 2017, Gary Haggarty, former UVF commander for north Belfast and south-east Antrim, pleaded guilty to 200 charges, including five murders.

On 23 March 2019, eleven alleged UVF members were arrested during a total of 14 searches conducted in Belfast, Newtownards and Comber and the suspects, aged between 22 and 48, were taken into police custody for questioning. Officers from the PSNI&#x27;s Paramilitary Crime Task Force also seized drugs, cash and expensive cars and jewellery in an operation carried out against the criminal activities of the UVF crime gang.

===2020s===
On 4 March 2021, the UVF, Red Hand Commando and UDA renounced their current participation in the Good Friday Agreement.

In April 2021, riots erupted across Loyalist communities in Northern Ireland. On 11 April, the UVF reportedly ordered the removal of Catholic families from a housing estate in Carrickfergus.

The UVF was suspected of organising a hoax bomb attack targeting a &quot;peace-building&quot; event in Belfast where Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney was speaking on 27 March 2022. Armed men hijacked a van on the nearby Shankill Road and forced the driver to take a device to a church on the Crumlin Road. The community centre hosting the event and 25 nearby homes were evacuated and a funeral was disrupted. A controlled explosion was carried out and the bomb was declared a hoax.

On 26 March 2022, the UVF was linked to a hoax bomb alert at a bar in Warrenpoint, County Down.

The group also continues to carry out racist and sectarian attacks against Black people and Eastern Europeans in Northern Ireland. The police stated the group had contributed to a 70% rise in hate crime: &quot;It has a deeply unpleasant taste of a bit of ethnic cleansing.&quot;

==Leadership==

===Brigade Staff===

The UVF&#x27;s leadership is based in Belfast and known as the Brigade Staff. It comprises high-ranking officers under a Chief of Staff or Brigadier-General. With a few exceptions, such as Mid-Ulster brigadier Billy Hanna (a native of Lurgan), the Brigade Staff members have been from the Shankill Road or the neighbouring Woodvale area to the west. The Brigade Staff&#x27;s former headquarters were situated in rooms above &quot;The Eagle&quot; chip shop located on the Shankill Road at its junction with Spier&#x27;s Place. The chip shop has since been closed down.

In 1972, the UVF&#x27;s imprisoned leader Gusty Spence was at liberty for four months following a staged kidnapping by UVF volunteers. During this time he restructured the organisation into brigades, battalions, companies, platoons and sections. These were all subordinate to the Brigade Staff. The incumbent Chief of Staff, is alleged to be John &quot;Bunter&quot; Graham, referred to by Martin Dillon as &quot;Mr. F&quot;. Graham has held the position since he assumed office in 1976.

The UVF&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Blacknecks&quot;, derived from their uniform of black polo neck jumper, black trousers, black leather jacket, black forage cap, along with the UVF badge and belt. This uniform, based on those of the original UVF, was introduced in the early 1970s.

===Chiefs of Staff===
* Gusty Spence (1966). Whilst remaining &quot;de jure&quot; UVF leader after he was jailed for murder, he no longer acted as Chief of Staff.
*Samuel Stevenson (1966‐1969). Stevenson, a close ally of Rev. Ian Paisley, confessed to being UVF chief of staff while undergoing questioning on explosives, a charge he later admitted 1970.
* Sam &quot;Bo&quot; McClelland (1969–1973) Described as a &quot;tough disciplinarian&quot;, he was personally appointed by Spence to succeed him as Chief of Staff, due to his having served in the Korean War with Spence&#x27;s former regiment, the Royal Ulster Rifles. He was interned in late 1973, although by that stage the &quot;de facto&quot; Chief of Staff was his successor, Jim Hanna.
* Jim Hanna (1973 – April 1974) Hanna was allegedly shot dead by the UVF as a suspected informer.
* Ken Gibson (1974) Gibson was the Chief of Staff during the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council Strike in May 1974.
* Unnamed Chief of Staff (1974 – October 1975). Leader of the Young Citizen Volunteers (YCV), the youth wing of the UVF. Assumed command after a coup by hardliners in 1974. He, along with the other hawkish Brigade Staff members, was overthrown by Tommy West and a new Brigade Staff of &quot;moderates&quot; in a counter-coup supported by Gusty Spence. He left Northern Ireland after his removal from power.
* Tommy West (October 1975 – 1976) A former British Army soldier, West was already the Chief of Staff at the time UVF volunteer Noel &quot;Nogi&quot; Shaw was killed by Lenny Murphy in November 1975 as part of an internal feud.
* John &quot;Bunter&quot; Graham, also referred to as &quot;Mr. F&quot; (1976–present)

==Aim and strategy==

The UVF&#x27;s stated goal was to combat Irish republicanism – particularly the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) – and maintain Northern Ireland&#x27;s status as part of the United Kingdom. The vast majority of its victims were Irish Catholic civilians, who were often killed at random. Whenever it claimed responsibility for its attacks, the UVF usually claimed that those targeted were IRA members or were giving help to the IRA. At other times, attacks on Catholic civilians were claimed as &quot;retaliation&quot; for IRA actions, since the IRA drew almost all of its support from the Catholic community. Such retaliation was seen as both collective punishment and an attempt to weaken the IRA&#x27;s support; it was thought that terrorising the Catholic community and inflicting such a death toll on it would force the IRA to end its campaign. Many retaliatory attacks on Catholics were claimed using the covername &quot;Protestant Action Force&quot; (PAF), which first appeared in autumn 1974. They always signed their statements with the fictitious name &quot;Captain William Johnston&quot;.

Like the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the UVF&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; involved assassinations, mass shootings, bombings and kidnappings. It used submachine guns, assault rifles, shotguns, pistols, grenades (including homemade grenades), incendiary bombs, booby trap bombs and car bombs. Referring to its activity in the early and mid-1970s, journalist Ed Moloney described no-warning pub bombings as the UVF&#x27;s &quot;forte&quot;. Members were trained in bomb-making, and the organisation developed home-made explosives. In the late summer and autumn of 1973, the UVF detonated more bombs than the UDA and IRA combined, and by the time of the group&#x27;s temporary ceasefire in late November it had been responsible for over 200 explosions that year. However, from 1977 bombs largely disappeared from the UVF&#x27;s arsenal owing to a lack of explosives and bomb-makers, plus a conscious decision to abandon their use in favour of more contained methods. The UVF did not return to regular bombings until the early 1990s when it obtained a quantity of the mining explosive Powergel.

===Strength===
The strength of the UVF is uncertain. The first Independent Monitoring Commission report in April 2004 described the UVF/RHC as &quot;relatively small&quot; with &quot;a few hundred&quot; active members &quot;based mainly in the Belfast and immediately adjacent areas&quot;. Historically, the number of active UVF members in July 1971 was stated by one source to be no more than 20. Later, in September 1972, Gusty Spence said in an interview that the organisation had a strength of 1,500. A British Army report released in 2006 estimated a peak membership of 1,000. Information regarding the role of women in the UVF is limited. One study focusing in part on female members of the UVF and Red Hand Commando noted that it &quot;seem[ed] to have been reasonably unusual&quot; for women to be officially asked to join the UVF. Another estimates that over a 30-year period women accounted for, at most, just 2% of UVF membership.

===Finance===

Prior to and after the onset of the Troubles the UVF carried out armed robberies. This activity has been described as its preferred source of funds in the early 1970s, and it continued into the 2000s, with the UVF in County Londonderry being active. Members were disciplined after they carried out an unsanctioned theft of £8 million of paintings from an estate in Co Wicklow in April 1974. Like the IRA, the UVF also operated black taxi services, a scheme believed to have generated £100,000 annually for the organisation. The UVF has also been involved in the extortion of legitimate businesses, although to a lesser extent than the UDA, and was described in the fifth IMC report as being involved in organised crime. In 2002 the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee estimated the UVF&#x27;s annual running costs at £1–2 million per year, against an annual fundraising capability of £1.5 million.

A Canadian branch of the UDA also existed and sent $30,000 to the UDA&#x27;s headquarters in Belfast by 1975. The Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee noted in its report that &quot;in 1992 it was estimated that Scottish support for the UDA and UVF might amount to £100,000 a year.&quot;

====Drug dealing====
The UVF have been implicated in drug dealing in areas from where they draw their support. Recently it has emerged from the Police Ombudsman that senior North Belfast UVF member and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Special Branch informant Mark Haddock has been involved in drug dealing. According to the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot;, &quot;70 separate police intelligence reports implicating the north Belfast UVF man in dealing cannabis, Ecstasy, amphetamines and cocaine.&quot;

According to Alan McQuillan, the assistant director of the Assets Recovery Agency in 2005, &quot;In the loyalist community, drug dealing is run by the paramilitaries and it is generally run for personal gain by a large number of people.&quot; When the Assets Recovery Agency won a High Court order to seize luxury homes belonging to ex-policeman Colin Robert Armstrong and his partner Geraldine Mallon in 2005, Alan McQuillan said &quot;We have further alleged Armstrong has had links with the UVF and then the LVF following the split between those organisations.&quot; It was alleged that Colin Armstrong had links to both drugs and loyalist terrorists.

Billy Wright, the commander of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade, is believed to have started dealing drugs in 1991 as a lucrative sideline to paramilitary murder. Wright is believed to have dealt mainly in Ecstasy tablets in the early 90s. It was around this time that Sunday World journalists Martin O&#x27;Hagan and Jim Campbell coined the term &quot;rat pack&quot; for the UVF&#x27;s murderous mid-Ulster unit and, unable to identify Wright by name for legal reasons, they christened him &quot;King Rat.&quot; An article published by the newspaper fingered Wright as a drug lord and sectarian murderer. Wright was apparently enraged by the nickname and made numerous threats to O&#x27;Hagan and Campbell. The Sunday World&#x27;s offices were also firebombed. Mark Davenport from the BBC has stated that he spoke to a drug dealer who told him that he paid Billy Wright protection money. Loyalists in Portadown such as Bobby Jameson have stated that the LVF (the Mid-Ulster Brigade that broke away from the main UVF - and led by Billy Wright) was not a &#x27;loyalist organisation but a drugs organisation causing misery in Portadown.&#x27;

The UVF&#x27;s satellite organisation, the Red Hand Commando, was described by the IMC in 2004 as &quot;heavily involved&quot; in drug dealing.

==Arms importation==
In contrast to the IRA, overseas support for loyalist paramilitaries including the UVF has been limited. Its main benefactors have been in central Scotland, Liverpool, Preston and the Toronto area of Canada.

===Great Britain===
Scotland was a source of funding and aid, supplying explosives and guns. Former MI5 agent Willie Carlin said: “There were safe houses in Glasgow and Stirling. The ferry [between Scotland and Northern Ireland] was pivotal in getting arms into the north – and anything like checkpoints, or armed police and Army in Scotland would have b******d that all up.” An Irish government memo written by David Donoghue stated: &quot;The commonest contribution of Scots UDA and UVF is to send gelignite. Explosives for the north were mostly shipped in small boats which set out at night from the Scottish coast and made contact at sea with vessels from Ulster ports.&quot; Donoghue noted the links between Orange Lodges in Scotland and loyalist paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland and that membership of the Orange Order in Scotland at the time was 80,000, and was concentrated in Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Inverness. It is estimated that the UVF nevertheless received hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations to its Loyalist Prisoners Welfare Association.

===North America===
Protestants in Canada also supported the loyalist paramilitaries in the conflict. Sociologist Steven Bruce described the support networks in Canada as &quot;the main source of support for loyalism outside the United Kingdom . . . Ontario is to Ulster Protestants what Boston is to Irish Catholics.&quot; After the Troubles began, an Orange-Canadian loyalist organization known as the Canadian Ulster Loyalist Association (CULA) sprang to life to provide the &#x27;besieged&#x27; Protestants with the resources to arm themselves. In 1972, five Toronto businessmen shipped weapons in grain container ships out of Halifax, bound for ports in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland which were destined for loyalist militants. 
Etobicoke based gunsmith William Charles Taylor and former Canadian Army Reserve officer Howard Wright sourced many second hand firearms at gun shows in the US and then smuggled them to the UVF wrapped in lead foil (to defeat X Ray scanners) in packages marked as &quot;car components&quot; from Old Mill Pontiac Buick in Toronto. Additionally, any semi-automatic rifles or submachine guns they sourced were first illegally converted to full-auto by Taylor before shipment. The pair were responsible for the UVF obtaining hundreds of military grade weapons such as MAC-10s, Uzis, and Colt Commando carbines in the early 1980s. Between 1979 and 1986, Canadian supporters supplied the UVF/UDA with 100 machine guns and thousands of rifles, grenade launchers, magnum revolvers, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition. These shipments were considered enough for the UVF/UDA to wage its campaign, most of which were used to kill its victims. On 10 February 1976, following the sudden uptick of violence against Catholic civilians by loyalist militants, Irish cardinal William Conway and nine other Catholic bishops met with British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his cabinet, asking them as to where the loyalist militants had acquired guns, to which Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Merlyn Rees replied &quot;Canada&quot;.

===Middle East===
In June 1987, the UVF stole over £325,000 during an armed robbery at a branch of the Northern Bank in Portadown. The cash was then laundered through Swiss banks accounts and other financial institutions in mainland Europe, where &quot;respectable&quot; members of the Unionist business community made in person lodgements. The money was then used to buy an arms shipment from Christian militia groups in Lebanon, that was to be split evenly between the UVF, the UDA, and Ulster Resistance. The weapons, which amounted to over 200 Vz. 58 assault rifles, 94 Browning Hi-Power pistols, 4 RPG-7 rocket launchers and dozens of warheads, over 400 RGD-5 grenades and 30,000 rounds of ammunition arrived at Belfast docks in December 1987, and was thereafter distributed to the three loyalist paramilitary groups. Although the arms were sourced in Lebanon, it has been alleged that the ultimate supplier was Armscor in South Africa, who funneled the shipment through a series of middlemen (such as American arms dealer Douglas Bernhardt) to disguise its true source. After the cash had been couriered over to Bernhardt&#x27;s office in Geneva, he was alleged to have then arranged a bank draft to be forwarded to an arms dealer in Beirut, who then sourced the weapons and loaded then into a shipping container labelled as ceramic floor tiles. A supposed motive for Apartheid South Africa to get involved in supplying arms to loyalist paramilitary groups was their attempts to obtain classified Starstreak surface-to-air missile technology from the Short Brothers factory in Belfast, evidence of which was uncovered after representatives from Ulster Resistance were arrested in Paris in April 1989, along with Bernhardt and a diplomat from South Africa, while in the possession of stolen missile parts.

===Eastern Europe===
On 24 November 1993, following a tip off from MI6, UK customs officers raided the MV Inowroclaw cargo ship while it was docked at Teesport and discovered a UVF weapons and explosives shipment hidden amongst a load of ceramic tiles. The shipment, which was described the as the biggest illegal arms seizure on British soil, contained 300 AKM rifles with thousands of rounds of ammunition, dozens of 9mm pistols, hundreds of hand grenades, over two metric tons of plastic explosives and thousands of detonators. The ship had originated in the Baltic Sea port of Gdynia, and Polish authorities had warned British intelligence agencies in advance of its arrival in England.

==Affiliated groups==
*The Red Hand Commando (RHC) is an organisation that was established in 1972 and is closely linked with the UVF. It also allowed other groups to claim attacks under its name.
*The Young Citizen Volunteers (YCV) is the youth section of the UVF. It was initially a youth group akin to the Scouts, but became the youth wing of the UVF during the Home Rule crisis.
*The Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) is the political wing of the UVF. In June 2010, its sole member in the Northern Ireland Assembly, party leader Dawn Purvis, resigned from the PUP over the UVF being accused of involvement in the Moffett murder.
* The Protestant Action Force (PAF) was a cover name used by the UVF to avoid directly claiming responsibility for killings and other acts of violence. The names were first used during the early 1970s.

==Deaths as a result of activity==
The UVF has killed more people than any other loyalist paramilitary group. Malcolm Sutton&#x27;s &quot;Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland&quot;, part of the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), states that the UVF and RHC was responsible for at least 485 killings during the Troubles, and lists a further 256 loyalist killings that have not yet been attributed to a particular group. According to the book &quot;Lost Lives&quot; (2006 edition), it was responsible for 569 killings.

Of those killed by the UVF and RHC:

*414 (~85%) were civilians, 11 of whom were civilian political activists
*21 (~4%) were members or former members of republican paramilitary groups
*44 (~9%) were members or former members of loyalist paramilitary groups
*6 (~1%) were members of the British security forces

There were also 66 UVF/RHC members and four former members killed in the conflict.

<text>The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is an area where Earth&#x27;s inner Van Allen radiation belt comes closest to Earth&#x27;s surface, dipping down to an altitude of . This leads to an increased flux of energetic particles in this region and exposes orbiting satellites (including the ISS) to higher-than-usual levels of ionizing radiation.

The effect is caused by the non-concentricity of Earth with its magnetic dipole and has been observed to be increasing in intensity recently. The SAA is the near-Earth region where Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is weakest relative to an idealized Earth-centered dipole field.

==Definition==
The area of the SAA is confined by the intensity of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at less than 32,000 nanotesla at sea level, which corresponds to the dipolar magnetic field at ionospheric altitudes. However, the field itself varies in intensity as a gradient.

==Position and shape==

The Van Allen radiation belts are symmetric about the Earth&#x27;s magnetic axis, which is tilted with respect to the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis by an angle of approximately 11°. The intersection between the magnetic and rotation axes of the Earth is located not at the Earth&#x27;s center, but some away. Because of this asymmetry, the inner Van Allen belt is closest to the Earth&#x27;s surface over the south Atlantic Ocean where it dips down to in altitude, and farthest from the Earth&#x27;s surface over the north Pacific Ocean.
If Earth&#x27;s magnetism is represented by a bar magnet of small size but strong intensity (&quot;magnetic dipole&quot;), the SAA variation can be illustrated by placing the magnet not in the plane of the Equator, but some small distance North, shifted more or less in the direction of Singapore. As a result, over northern South America and the south Atlantic, near Singapore&#x27;s antipodal point, the magnetic field is relatively weak, resulting in a lower repulsion to trapped particles of the radiation belts there, and as a result these particles reach deeper into the upper atmosphere than they otherwise would.

The shape of the SAA changes over time. Since its initial discovery in 1958, the southern limits of the SAA have remained roughly constant while a long-term expansion has been measured to the northwest, the north, the northeast, and the east. Additionally, the shape and particle density of the SAA varies on a diurnal basis, with greatest particle density corresponding roughly to local noon. At an altitude of approximately , the SAA spans from geographic latitude and from longitude. The highest intensity portion of the SAA drifts to the west at a speed of about 0.3° per year, and is noticeable in the references listed below. The drift rate of the SAA is very close to the rotation differential between the Earth&#x27;s core and its surface, estimated to be between 0.3° and 0.5° per year. 

Current literature suggests that a slow weakening of the geomagnetic field is one of several causes for the changes in the borders of the SAA since its discovery. As the geomagnetic field continues to weaken, the inner Van Allen belt gets closer to the Earth, with a commensurate enlargement of the SAA at given altitudes. During the Middle Holocene, the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field in the region occupied by the SAA was relatively calm and quiescent, contrasting with its present day activity.

The South Atlantic Anomaly seems to be caused by a huge reservoir of very dense rock inside the Earth called the African large low-shear velocity province.

The position of the anomaly can be that of the maximum magnetic flux or that of the centroid of the flux, which is less sensitive to sampling noise and more representative of the feature as a whole. In January 2021, the centroid was located near and drifting about 0.23°S 0.34°W per year.

==Intensity and effects==

The South Atlantic Anomaly is of great significance to astronomical satellites and other spacecraft that orbit the Earth at several hundred kilometers altitude; these orbits take satellites through the anomaly periodically, exposing them to several minutes of strong ionizing radiation, caused by the trapped protons in the inner Van Allen belt.

Measurements on Space Shuttle flight STS-94 have ascertained that absorbed dose rates from charged particles have extended from 112 to 175 μGy/day, with dose equivalent rates ranging from 264.3 to 413 μSv/day.

The International Space Station, orbiting with an inclination of 51.6°, requires extra shielding to deal with this problem. The Hubble Space Telescope does not take observations with its sensitive UV detectors while passing through the SAA. Passing through the anomaly caused false alarms on Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount&#x27;s solar flare sensor. Astronauts are also affected by this region, which is said to be the cause of peculiar &quot;shooting stars&quot; (phosphenes) seen in the visual field of astronauts, an effect termed cosmic ray visual phenomena. Passing through the South Atlantic Anomaly is thought to be the reason for the failures of the Globalstar network&#x27;s satellites in 2007.

The PAMELA experiment, while passing through the SAA, detected antiproton levels that were orders of magnitude higher than expected. This suggests the Van Allen belt confines antiparticles produced by the interaction of the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere with cosmic rays.

NASA has reported that modern laptop computers have crashed when Space Shuttle flights passed through the anomaly.

In October 2012, the SpaceX CRS-1 Dragon spacecraft attached to the International Space Station experienced a transient problem as it passed through the anomaly.

The SAA is believed to have started a series of events leading to the destruction of the Hitomi, Japan&#x27;s most powerful X-ray observatory. The anomaly transiently disabled a direction-finding mechanism, causing the satellite to rely solely on gyroscopes that were not working properly, after which it spun out of control, losing its solar panels in the process.

<doc id="80725" wikidata="Q20858458" url="?curid=80725" title="Beyond Our Ken">
<text>Beyond Our Ken is a BBC radio comedy programme first broadcast between 1958 and 1964. It starred Kenneth Horne, with Kenneth Williams, Hugh Paddick, Betty Marsden, Bill Pertwee, and, as announcer, Douglas Smith. The title is a play on the name Kenneth and the familiar expression &quot;beyond our ken&quot; (&quot;&quot; being a mainly Northern English and Scots word meaning &#x27;knowledge or perception&#x27;).

The show ran for seven series, and a total of 121 shows. The scripts were by Eric Merriman, with Barry Took as co-writer in the first two series. Musical accompaniment was provided by the BBC Revue Orchestra, with musical interludes mostly by the Fraser Hayes Four.

When the show finished it was replaced by the series &quot;Round the Horne&quot; (1965–1968), which built on, and exceeded, the success of the earlier show.

==Background==

Eric Merriman had written some material for Barry Took, when the latter was an aspiring stand-up comic. They subsequently collaborated in writing material for Kenneth Horne for BBC radio shows, and in June 1957 the BBC producer Jacques Brown asked Merriman to devise a thirty-minute show with Horne as the star. The proposal was for a series depicting a fictional week in Horne&#x27;s life. The original working title was &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;, but a senior official in the BBC&#x27;s Variety department thought the title weak, and Took was asked to suggest some alternatives. His own preferred title was &quot;Round the Horne&quot;, and Merriman favoured &quot;Hornerama&quot;, but from Took&#x27;s list the BBC chose &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot;, and it was under that title that Merriman and Took completed the script for the pilot show.

For the supporting cast it was agreed that the show required a strong team of versatile comedy actors who could play a wide range of parts. They were drawn from the West End and BBC radio and television. From revue the show featured the actors Ron Moody and Hugh Paddick and the singer Pat Lancaster; from BBC television, Betty Marsden; and from radio Kenneth Williams.

==Production history==

The pilot was recorded on 2 October 1957. It was well received by the studio audience and the BBC agreed to go ahead with a series. The project was put on hold in February 1958 after Horne suffered a stroke that left him partially paralysed. He made an almost complete recovery – left with only a slight limp – and was able to return to broadcasting. There followed seven series of the show, beginning in July 1958 and ending in February 1964. Moody left after the first series, concluding that he was less suited than his colleagues to radio performance. His replacement was Bill Pertwee, whom Horne had encountered in Pertwee&#x27;s early days as a performer, and whose versatility impressed him. After the second series, Merriman and Took fell out, and the former rejected Horne&#x27;s plea that Took should be invited to contribute material to future shows. Merriman insisted on being recognised as the sole writer for the duration of the show.

===Series===
In 1964 Merriman quarrelled with the BBC and refused to go on writing &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot;. The BBC proposed to continue without him, keeping Horne and the team together in a show provisionally titled &quot;It&#x27;s Ken Again&quot;, to be written by Took and his new writing partner, Marty Feldman. In the face of Merriman&#x27;s furious objections, the new series went ahead, with the title changed to &quot;Round the Horne&quot;. Merriman was further embittered when the new show surpassed the popularity and reputation of &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; and he never forgave Took. Horne&#x27;s biographer Barry Johnston comments &quot;If Kenneth Horne had retired from broadcasting after the final episode of &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot;, he would still have been remembered as the star of two of the most successful radio comedy series ever. His place as one of the all-time greats of British comedy, however, is due to the extraordinary popularity of &quot;Round the Horne&quot;.&quot; Nevertheless, in the words of the BBC, &quot;While &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; might have been outshone by its successor, it shared much of the same DNA that made &quot;Round the Horne&quot; one of the greats&quot;.

==Format==

Like &quot;ITMA&quot; and &quot;Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh&quot; before it, &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; interspersed comic sections with musical interludes, but it differed from them and all its other predecessors in the way the show opened each week. Instead of an opening signature tune, the programme began with a short sketch of a few lines, usually based on a punning reference to a film title (for instance a man running a flea circus for more than six years was the key to &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;). After that the announcer, Douglas Smith, would welcome listeners and introduce the fictional guests appearing that week, such as &quot;General Sir Gertrude Fanshawe, Marion Haste, The House of Lords Banjo Octet, Dizzy Barbirolli, and of course Mr Kenneth Horne, who prefers to remain anonymous&quot;.

==Characters==
&quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; featured regular characters. As panellists in a parody of &quot;Any Questions?&quot; the cast gently burlesqued real broadcasting celebrities. Marsden&#x27;s hoarse-voiced Fanny Haddock, Pertwee&#x27;s camp Hanky Flowerd, Paddick&#x27;s gormless Ricky Livid and Williams&#x27;s suggestive rustic Arthur Fallowfield parodied, respectively, the cook Fanny Cradock, the comedian Frankie Howerd, the pop star Marty Wilde and the West country farmer and pundit Ralph Wightman. Some of these characters had their own catch-phrases: Ricky Livid&#x27;s was &quot;I like the backing&quot;, and Fallowfield&#x27;s response to every question began &quot;The answer lies in the soil&quot;. Elsewhere in the programmes the regular characters included Ambrose and Felicity (described by Took as &quot;a pair of doddering old idiots&quot;), played by Williams and Marsden. Another – unnamed – ancient personage, played by Williams, had been doing whatever he was doing on each programme for &quot;thirty-five years&quot;; Stanley Birkinshaw (Paddick) was a man with ill-fitting false teeth speaking with distorted sibilants and spraying saliva in all directions. Another regular was the supposed BBC commentator Cecil Snaith, played by Paddick and written not by Merriman or Took but by Horne; Snaith&#x27;s commentaries were invariably struck by disaster and ended, &quot;And with that, I return you to the studio&quot;. Two regulars who always appeared together were the men-about-town Rodney (Williams) and Charles (Paddick), variously described as &quot;jolly decent public school chaps&quot;, &quot;frightfully correct&quot;, &quot;a pair of effete young men&quot;, and &quot;two frightfully, frightfully Mayfair types, doing ridiculous things together like dressing up as red Indians when they took a canoeing holiday&quot;.

==Recordings==
As at May 2020 the BBC had licensed the release of the first four series of &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; on commercially available CD. In 2021 the BBC released two audiobook collections, the first containing all remaining episodes of Series 1-4, the second containing all episodes from Series 5-7. Several episodes are missing from the BBC archives. Series 1 is missing 9 episodes out of a total of 22. Series 2 is missing 7 episodes out of a total of 21. Series 4 is missing 1 episode out of a total of 20 episodes.

<text>Terry Scott, born Owen John Scott, (4 May 1927 – 26 July 1994) was an English actor and comedian who appeared in seven of the &quot;Carry On films&quot;. He is also well known for appearing in the BBC1 sitcoms &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; and &quot;Terry and June&quot; with June Whitfield.

==Early life==
Scott was born and brought up in Watford, Hertfordshire, and educated at Watford Field Junior School and Watford Grammar School for Boys. He was the youngest of three children, and the only surviving son after his brother Aubrey died when Scott was six. After National Service in the Navy at the end of the Second World War, he briefly studied accounting.

==Career==
Scott began his acting career with appearances on radio shows such as &quot;Workers Playtime&quot;, which were followed by appearances on television. He gained an opportunity to perform in farce when he joined the Whitehall Theatre Company. With Bill Maynard he appeared at Butlin&#x27;s Holiday Camp in Skegness, Lincolnshire and partnered him in the TV series &quot;Great Scott - It&#x27;s Maynard!&quot;. During the 1960s he appeared alongside Hugh Lloyd in &quot;Hugh and I&quot; (1962–1967). They both appeared as Ugly Sisters in pantomime at The London Palladium; Scott reappeared in later years in the same role alongside Julian Orchard. Scott and Lloyd later appeared in &quot;Hugh and I Spy&quot; (1968) and, as gnomes, in the sitcom &quot;The Gnomes of Dulwich&quot; (1969).

Scott&#x27;s novelty record &quot;My Brother&quot; (written by Mitch Murray, and released in 1962 on Parlophone) was based on a schoolboy character (he dressed in school uniform to sing it on TV). In the 1970s he had a role in TV commercials for Curly Wurly caramel bars, in which he again appeared dressed as a schoolboy, with short trousers and cap. He repeated this performance several times on BBC TV&#x27;s long-running variety show &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;. Scott had played a small role in the very first of the &quot;Carry On films&quot; series of films, &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot; in 1958. In 1968 he returned to the series with a role in &quot;Carry On Up the Khyber&quot; (1968), playing main roles in six of the later films.

Scott starred alongside June Whitfield in several series of the comedy &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; and its successor &quot;Terry and June&quot;. They had first worked together making a series of the sketch show &quot;Scott On&quot; (1968). They also featured in supporting roles together (as a couple) in the film version of &quot;Bless This House&quot;. Although both Scott and Whitfield made several &quot;Carry On&quot; appearances, they never appeared in the same film. From 1981 to 1992, Scott was the voice of Penfold the hamster in the animated series &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Scott suffered from ill health for several years in the latter part of his life. In 1979, he had a life-saving operation after a brain haemorrhage. He also suffered from creeping paralysis and had to wear a neck brace.

Scott was also diagnosed with cancer in 1987. He died from its effects at his family home in Witley, Surrey, on 26 July 1994, at the age of 67. He said of his last illness: &quot;I know it would be better to give up the booze, fags and birds, but life would be so boring, wouldn&#x27;t it?&quot;

When &quot;Terry and June&quot; ended in 1987, Scott suffered a nervous breakdown. The breakdown was in part brought on by his public confession that he had indulged in a series of affairs since his marriage to dancer Margaret Peden in 1957. The couple had four daughters.
