<text>A binary symmetric channel (or BSCp) is a common communications channel model used in coding theory and information theory. In this model, a transmitter wishes to send a bit (a zero or a one), and the receiver will receive a bit. The bit will be &quot;flipped&quot; with a &quot;crossover probability&quot; of &quot;p&quot;, and otherwise is received correctly. This model can be applied to varied communication channels such as telephone lines or disk drive storage.

The noisy-channel coding theorem applies to BSCp, saying that information can be transmitted at any rate up to the channel capacity with arbitrarily low error. The channel capacity is formula_1 bits, where formula_2 is the binary entropy function. Codes including Forney&#x27;s code have been designed to transmit information efficiently across the channel.

== Definition ==

A binary symmetric channel with crossover probability formula_3, denoted by BSCp, is a channel with binary input and binary output and probability of error formula_3. That is, if formula_5 is the transmitted random variable and formula_6 the received variable, then the channel is characterized by the conditional probabilities:

:formula_7

It is assumed that formula_8. If formula_9, then the receiver can swap the output (interpret 1 when it sees 0, and vice versa) and obtain an equivalent channel with crossover probability formula_10.

== Capacity ==

The channel capacity of the binary symmetric channel, in bits, is:
:formula_11
where formula_12 is the binary entropy function, defined by:
:formula_13

== Noisy-channel coding theorem ==
Shannon&#x27;s noisy-channel coding theorem gives a result about the rate of information that can be transmitted through a communication channel with arbitrarily low error. We study the particular case of formula_14.

The noise formula_15 that characterizes formula_16 is a random variable consisting of n independent random bits (n is defined below) where each random bit is a formula_17 with probability formula_3 and a formula_19 with probability formula_20. We indicate this by writing &quot;formula_21&quot;.

What this theorem actually implies is, a message when picked from formula_22, encoded with a random encoding function formula_23, and sent across a noisy formula_16, there is a very high probability of recovering the original message by decoding, if formula_25 or in effect the rate of the channel is bounded by the quantity stated in the theorem. The decoding error probability is exponentially small.

===Proof===
The theorem can be proved directly with a probabilistic method. Consider an encoding function formula_26 that is selected at random. This means that for each message formula_27, the value formula_28 is selected at random (with equal probabilities). For a given encoding function formula_23, the decoding function formula_30 is specified as follows: given any received codeword formula_31, we find the message formula_32 such that the Hamming distance formula_33 is as small as possible (with ties broken arbitrarily). (formula_34 is called a maximum likelihood decoding function.)

The proof continues by showing that at least one such choice formula_35 satisfies the conclusion of theorem, by integration over the probabilities. Suppose formula_3 and formula_37 are fixed. First we show that, for a fixed formula_38 and formula_23 chosen randomly, the probability of failure over formula_14 noise is exponentially small in &quot;n&quot;. At this point, the proof works for a fixed message formula_41. Next we extend this result to work for all messages formula_41. We achieve this by eliminating half of the codewords from the code with the argument that the proof for the decoding error probability holds for at least half of the codewords. The latter method is called expurgation. This gives the total process the name &quot;random coding with expurgation&quot;.


== Converse of Shannon&#x27;s capacity theorem ==

The converse of the capacity theorem essentially states that formula_43 is the best rate one can achieve over a binary symmetric channel. Formally the theorem states:

The intuition behind the proof is however showing the number of errors to grow rapidly as the rate grows beyond the channel capacity. The idea is the sender generates messages of dimension formula_25, while the channel formula_14 introduces transmission errors. When the capacity of the channel is formula_46, the number of errors is typically formula_47 for a code of block length formula_48. The maximum number of messages is formula_49. The output of the channel on the other hand has formula_50 possible values. If there is any confusion between any two messages, it is likely that formula_51. Hence we would have formula_52, a case we would like to avoid to keep the decoding error probability exponentially small.

== Codes ==
Very recently, a lot of work has been done and is also being done to design explicit error-correcting codes to achieve the capacities of several standard communication channels. The motivation behind designing such codes is to relate the rate of the code with the fraction of errors which it can correct.

The approach behind the design of codes which meet the channel capacities of formula_53 or the binary erasure channel formula_54 have been to correct a lesser number of errors with a high probability, and to achieve the highest possible rate. Shannon&#x27;s theorem gives us the best rate which could be achieved over a formula_16, but it does not give us an idea of any explicit codes which achieve that rate. In fact such codes are typically constructed to correct only a small fraction of errors with a high probability, but achieve a very good rate. The first such code was due to George D. Forney in 1966. The code is a concatenated code by concatenating two different kinds of codes.

=== Forney&#x27;s code ===

Forney constructed a concatenated code formula_56 to achieve the capacity of the noisy-channel coding theorem for formula_14. In his code,

* The outer code formula_58 is a code of block length formula_59 and rate formula_60 over the field formula_61, and formula_62. Additionally, we have a decoding algorithm formula_63 for formula_58 which can correct up to formula_65 fraction of worst case errors and runs in formula_66 time.
* The inner code formula_67 is a code of block length formula_48, dimension formula_25, and a rate of formula_70. Additionally, we have a decoding algorithm formula_71 for formula_67 with a decoding error probability of at most formula_73 over formula_14 and runs in formula_75 time. 
For the outer code formula_58, a Reed-Solomon code would have been the first code to have come in mind. However, we would see that the construction of such a code cannot be done in polynomial time. This is why a binary linear code is used for formula_58.

For the inner code formula_67 we find a linear code by exhaustively searching from the linear code of block length formula_48 and dimension formula_25, whose rate meets the capacity of formula_14, by the noisy-channel coding theorem.

The rate formula_82 which almost meets the formula_14 capacity. We further note that the encoding and decoding of formula_84 can be done in polynomial time with respect to formula_59. As a matter of fact, encoding formula_84 takes time formula_87. Further, the decoding algorithm described takes time formula_88 as long as formula_89; and formula_90.

==== Decoding error probability ====

A natural decoding algorithm for formula_84 is to:

* Assume formula_92 
* Execute formula_63 on formula_94

Note that each block of code for formula_67 is considered a symbol for formula_58. Now since the probability of error at any index formula_97 for formula_71 is at most formula_99 and the errors in formula_14 are independent, the expected number of errors for formula_71 is at most formula_102 by linearity of expectation. Now applying Chernoff bound, we have bound error probability of more than formula_103 errors occurring to be formula_104. Since the outer code formula_58 can correct at most formula_103 errors, this is the decoding error probability of formula_84. This when expressed in asymptotic terms, gives us an error probability of formula_108. Thus the achieved decoding error probability of formula_84 is exponentially small as the noisy-channel coding theorem.

We have given a general technique to construct formula_84. For more detailed descriptions on formula_67 and formula_58 please read the following references. Recently a few other codes have also been constructed for achieving the capacities. LDPC codes have been considered for this purpose for their faster decoding time.

== Applications ==
The binary symmetric channel can model a disk drive used for memory storage: the channel input represents a bit being written to the disk and the output corresponds to the bit later being read. Error could arise from the magnetization flipping, background noise or the writing head making an error. Other objects which the binary symmetric channel can model include a telephone or radio communication line or cell division, from which the daughter cells contain DNA information from their parent cell.

This channel is often used by theorists because it is one of the simplest noisy channels to analyze. Many problems in communication theory can be reduced to a BSC. Conversely, being able to transmit effectively over the BSC can give rise to solutions for more complicated channels.

<text>The square metre (international spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures) or square meter (American spelling) is the unit of area in the International System of Units (SI) with symbol m2. It is the area of a square with sides one metre in length.

Adding and subtracting SI prefixes creates multiples and submultiples; however, as the unit is exponentiated, the quantities grow exponentially by the corresponding power of 10. For example, 1 kilometre is 103 (one thousand) times the length of 1 metre, but 1 square kilometre is (103)2 (106, one million) times the area of 1 square metre, and 1 cubic kilometre is (103)3 (109, one billion) cubic metres.

==SI prefixes applied==

The square metre may be used with all SI prefixes used with the metre.

== Unicode characters ==

Unicode has several characters used to represent metric area units, but these are for compatibility with East Asian character encodings and are meant to be used in new documents.

<text>Justicia brandegeeana, the Mexican shrimp plant, shrimp plant or false hop, is an evergreen shrub in the genus &quot;Justicia&quot; of the acanthus family Acanthaceae, native to Mexico, and also naturalized in Florida.

It grows to 1 m tall (rarely more) with spindly limbs. The leaves are oval, green, 3–7.5 cm long. The flowers are white, extending from red bracts which look somewhat like shrimps, hence the common name &quot;shrimp flower&quot;.

The specific epithet is named for the American botanist Townshend Stith Brandegee (1843–1925). It is sometimes misspelled &quot;brandegeana&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Justicia brandegeeana&quot; is a bushy evergreen shrub growing to tall by broad. The stems and leaves are downy. The leaves are variegated and usually grow in clusters on the branches. As the plant receives more sun, the amount of creamy white on the speckled leaves will increase, and vice versa. The flowers emerge from bracts that form off the stems. The bracts start out white, but with more sun exposure they turn anywhere from pale pink to deep salmon. A chain of bracts will continue to grow until it falls off in most cases; thus the chains can grow anywhere from a few centimetres to nearly in length. Flowers emerge from the bracts; usually they are long, thin, and white with speckled maroon throats.

Blooming continues for months once it has begun, then halts for a short period before starting again. The flowers attract hummingbirds and butterflies. Pollination is usually by hummingbirds

The family &quot;Acanthaceae&quot; is in the major group Angiosperms (flowering plants). The genus &quot;Justicia&quot; is in the family &quot;Acanthaceae&quot;. The genus &quot;Justicia&quot; comprises about 600 species. Research has been done on the phytochemical components of the numerous Justicia species, showing that they possess antitumor, antiviral and antidiabetic activity. &quot;J. brandegeena&quot; has not been a topic of phytochemical research until recently.

==Pests and diseases==

Spider mites and whiteflies may be a problem.

Nematodes

Root Rot: Fungal diseases that cause decay and rotting of the roots and premature plant death

Fungal leaf spotting or rust may afflict plants.
==Cultivation==
The shrimp plant thrives in the shade in tropical areas. It does best in well-drained sandy or loamy soil, but is generally low maintenance and drought-tolerant. As it dislikes temperatures below , in cooler temperate areas it is best grown under glass, where it is excellent as a potted houseplant, owing to its ability to tolerate low light and some neglect. Fertilization is not required.

The shape is generally long and spindly. If trimmed back regularly, it can maintain a bushy habit and will not need support. If the branches are allowed to grow long, they will become unable to support themselves and sag towards the ground.

Numerous cultivars are available, with different flower bract colors, including yellow, pink and dark brick-red.

It can be propagated by stem cuttings.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

In terms of maintenance, if &quot;Justicia brandegeeana&quot; is not kept well trimmed it can become a messy shrub. Also, if left alone can grow over 24 inches tall. It therefore requires trimming back annually if it is to hold its shape and retain a desirable size. This shrub is expected to last for 10 to 20 years.

<text>Michael I Rangabe (also spelled Rhangabe; ; c. 770 – 11 January 844) was Byzantine emperor from 811 to 813. A courtier of Emperor Nikephoros I (), he survived the disastrous campaign against the Bulgars and was preferred as imperial successor over Staurakios (), who was severely injured. He was proclaimed emperor by Patriarch Nicephorus I of Constantinople on 2 October 811.

Michael&#x27;s policies were generally conciliatory, and he was overwhelmingly influenced by the iconodule clerics Nikephoros and Theodore the Stoudite. He improved relations with the Franks, even to the point of recognising Charlemagne as an emperor – although not &quot;of the Romans&quot; – and requesting papal arbitration in the Moechian controversy. His half-hearted leadership of the campaign against the Bulgars resulted in defeat in the Battle of Versinikia. The &quot;stratēgos&quot; of the Anatolic Theme, Leo the Armenian, a popular and successful general, abandoned Michael on the battlefield but was proclaimed emperor by the military, in what was the last military overthrow of an emperor in Byzantine history. Michael was pressured to abdicate, and he retired to a monastery. His sons were castrated to prevent the continuation of his dynasty.

== Biography ==


Michael was the son of the patrician Theophylact Rhangabe, the admiral of the Aegean fleet. The Rangabe family was of Greek origin. He married Prokopia, the daughter of the former Emperor Nikephoros I, and received the high court dignity of &quot;Kouropalates&quot; after his father-in-law&#x27;s accession in 802.

Michael survived Nikephoros I&#x27;s disastrous campaign against Khan Krum of Bulgaria, and was considered a more appropriate candidate for the throne than his severely injured brother-in-law Staurakios, who was proclaimed emperor by the military in the hope that he would recover. When Michael&#x27;s wife Prokopia failed to persuade her brother Staurakios, who wanted to have him blinded, to name Michael as his successor, a group of senior officials (the &quot;magistros&quot; Theoktistos, Domestic of the Schools Stephen, and Patriarch Nicephorus I of Constantinople) forced Staurakios to abdicate in his favour on 2 October 811. Michael was proclaimed emperor before the senate and the &quot;tagmata&quot;.

Michael I attempted to carry out a policy of reconciliation, abandoning the exacting taxation instituted by Nikephoros I. While reducing imperial income, Michael generously distributed money to the army, the bureaucracy, and the church. Ruling with the support of the iconodule party in the Church, Michael I diligently persecuted the iconoclasts and forced Patriarch Nicephorus I to back down in his dispute with Theodore the Stoudite, the influential abbot of the monastery of Stoudios. He revoked the exile of Theodore the Stoudites effected by Emperor Nikephoros I, and Theodore became his close confidant. Michael I&#x27;s piety won him a very positive estimation in the work of the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor. Theophanes also mentions the existence of a group of heretics known as &quot;Athinganoi&quot; in Phrygia, who were most likely the successors of the Montanists, who Emperor Leo III the Isaurian () attempted to convert by force, as well as of the Paulicians. Patriarch Nicephorus I pressed Michael I to organise the persecution and execution of the &quot;Athinganoi&quot;, Paulicians and iconoclast abbots. But when Nicephorus I insisted the heretics be given time to repent, Michael I halted the killings.

In 812, Michael reopened negotiations with the Franks, and recognized Charlemagne as &quot;imperator&quot; and &quot;basileus&quot; (&quot;emperor&quot;), but not &quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot;. In exchange for that recognition, Venice and Istria were returned to the Empire. Michael I sent ambassadors to negotiate a marriage alliance between Michael&#x27;s son Theophylact and a Frankish princess. They also brought a letter from Patriarch Nicephorus I requesting papal arbitration on the issue of the Moechian controversy. Pope Leo III resolved the issue in favour of Theodore the Stoudites, who claimed that, as emperors were bound by canon law, Constantine VI&#x27;s second marriage was illicit, which was the view of Empress Irene against Emperor Nikephoros. The Pope&#x27;s judgment was treated as the formal closing of the affair.

There were also minor successes against the Arabs in the Anatolic Theme under its &quot;stratēgos&quot; Leo the Armenian, another figure exiled by Nikephoros and recalled by Michael. However, Michael dealt with the Bulgars poorly during his reign. In 812, Khan Krum besieged the frontier town of Develtos in Thrace, and Michael was too late to prevent its surrender. His soldiers mutinied, and people in western Thrace began to flee their homes. Some soldiers of the &quot;tagmata&quot; tried to proclaim the blinded sons of Constantine V as emperors, but Michael dismissed them in disgrace. The Bulgars nevertheless managed to capture almost all of the fortified towns on the Byzantine-Bulgarian border that were built and consolidated by Empress Irene and Emperors Constantine VI and Nikephoros in the previous decades. Michael was convinced by Nikephoros and Theodore to reject the peace terms offered by Krum, which involved the return of Christians who fled from Bulgarian territory, provoking the capture of Mesembria (Nesebar) by the Bulgars, the last border stronghold, executing all captives who refused to renounce Christianity. Michael I&#x27;s army prepared for a major engagement at Versinikia near Adrianople, but delayed his attack, leading to further discontent in the military. In June, he began the attack but appeared hesitant; Leo the Armenian fled halfway through the battle, causing a rout. This prompted suspicion of treachery, however, Leo was acclaimed emperor with the support of his soldiers. Once he arrived in Constantinople, Michael I was pressured to retire to a monastery. He was crowned by Patriarch Nicephorus I on 12 July 813 

With conspiracy in the air, Michael I preempted events by abdicating on 11 July 813 in favour of Leo the Armenian and becoming a monk (under the name Athanasios). His sons were castrated to end the dynasty and were relegated to monasteries, with one of them, Niketas (renamed Ignatios), eventually becoming Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Michael I died on 11 January 844.

=== Numismatics ===
The numismatic record of Michael&#x27;s reign begins after his son&#x27;s coronation as co-emperor in 811, with new &quot;nomismata&quot; struck, bearing Michael I on the obverse and Theophylact (son of Michael I) on the reverse. The &quot;miliarēsion&quot;, which had not been struck since the reign of Constantine VI (), was revived by Michael I with a notable alteration. The imperial title &quot;basileis&quot; was expanded to &quot;basileis romaion&quot; (&quot;emperors of the Romans&quot;), seemingly in response to Pope Leo III&#x27;s coronation of Charlemagne as emperor in 800.

== Assessment and legacy ==
The reigns of the iconoclast emperors Leo III the Isaurian () and Constantine V () were militarily successful and saw the abatement of the Arab and Bulgar threat. According to the iconodule Patriarch Nicephorus I of Constantinople, Leo III the Isaurian propaganda ascribed both their military successes and longevity to their iconoclasm. The validity of iconoclasm was only confirmed by the military disasters under the iconodule emperors Michael I and his predecessor Nikephoros I () as well as the success of the iconoclast Leo V the Armenian () against the Bulgars. Michael I was in general a weak emperor whose policies were formed in mere reaction to outside pressures. Warren Treadgold describes him as &quot;amiable to a fault, lacking in judgment and easily led&quot;, &quot;dithering&quot;, seeming &quot;to have done whatever he had been told most recently&quot;. He was also the last Byzantine emperor to be overthrown by the military, which is ironic given its increased strength in succeeding centuries.

In 813, Carolingian Emperor Charlemagne crowned his son Louis the Pious co-emperor in a manner resembling Michael I&#x27;s crowning of his own son, Theophylact, in 811. This was likely because of the Byzantine practice of inviting foreign ambassadors to witness state rituals. Accepting one such invitation, Hugh of Tours, Count of Tours, and Haito, Bishop of Basel, were present for Michael I&#x27;s crowning of his son, and so probably returned to the Frankish court with knowledge of Byzantine ceremonies.

== Family ==
By his wife Prokopia, Michael I had at least five children:
* Georgo, a daughter;
* Theophylact, crowned co-emperor on Christmas 811, became a monk after 813;
* Niketas, later Patriarch Ignatios of Constantinople ( 798–877);
* Staurakios, crowned co-emperor on Christmas 811, pre-deceased his father;
* Theophano, a daughter.

<doc id="74374" wikidata="Q41622" url="?curid=74374" title="Michael III">
<text>Michael III (; 9/10 January 840 – 24 September 867), also known as Michael the Drunkard, was Byzantine emperor from 842 to 867. Michael III was the third and traditionally last member of the Amorian (or Phrygian) dynasty. He was given the disparaging epithet &quot;the Drunkard&quot; () by the hostile historians of the succeeding Macedonian dynasty, but modern historical research has rehabilitated his reputation to some extent, demonstrating the vital role his reign played in the resurgence of Byzantine power in the 9th century. He was also the youngest person to bear the imperial title, as well as the youngest to succeed as senior emperor.

==Life==
===Early life and regency===
Michael was the youngest child of the emperor Theophilos and his empress Theodora. His precise date of birth is uncertain, but the balance of available evidence supports a birthdate in early 840, probably on 9 or 10 January. He was crowned co-emperor soon after, probably on 16 May of the same year. Michael had just turned two years old when his father died, and Michael succeeded him as sole emperor on 20 January 842.

During Michael&#x27;s minority, the empire was governed by a regency headed by his mother Theodora, her uncle Sergios, and the eunuch Theoktistos, who was Postal Logothete and the most powerful of the three. Within a year the regents had begun to carefully plan a program of restoring iconophile orthodoxy. Stories of Theodora&#x27;s secret devotion to images during Theophilos&#x27; reign are dubious and she was likely motivated not only by religious but also political and pragmatic concerns. Theoktistos had been an enthusiastic supporter of Theophilos and so was clearly motivated by pragmatism in endorsing the later iconophile program. Yet there was little opposition other than from John VII and the clergy of the Hagia Sophia. The future Patriarch Methodios I held a synod in the Palace of Blachernae rather than in the patriarchal church, which suggests that they resisted the changes. However in March, the &quot;Acts&quot; of the Second Council of Nicaea (787) were reaffirmed and the leading iconoclasts of the Council of Constantinople of 815 declared to be heretics. Theophilos was not mentioned in order to not alienate the ruling imperial family and its supporters. Theodora had also explicitly demanded that her husband not be dishonoured. Patriarch John VII of Constantinople was then asked to resign, and replaced him with the iconophile Methodios, who, despite his iconophilism, was a close associate of Theophilos. The occasion was marked with a solemn procession on the first Sunday of Lent (11 March 843), from Blachernae to the Hagia Sophia, followed by a liturgy in the church. These events came to be known as the &quot;Triumph of Orthodoxy&quot;. Methodios carried out an expulsion of iconoclast clergy and was later accused of fomenting dissension within the church. The sources, which are sympathetic to iconophilism, do not report much dissent among the clergy or general population, which suggests a general passivity or neutrality on the issue. With these events the second spell of Byzantine iconoclasm was put to an end, and the autonomy of the Church was affirmed against imperial power.
As the emperor was growing up, the courtiers around him fought for influence. Theoktistos disliked Michael&#x27;s uncle Bardas, and excluded him from court politics. When Theodora and Theoktistos arranged the marriage of Eudokia Dekapolitissa to Michael, who preferred Eudokia Ingerina, Bardas won his nephew&#x27;s favour by persuading him to allow a plot to murder Theoktistos. In 855, the regency was overthrown when Theoktistos was murdered in the Great Palace of Constantinople, and in 857, Theodora was barred from government and relegated along with her daughters to a monastery in 857.

===Warfare and foreign policy===

The internal stabilisation of the state was not entirely matched along the frontiers. Although the Abbasid Caliphate was no longer launching major invasions, and raids were led by local amirs in Anatolia rather than the Caliph himself, Byzantine forces were defeated by the Abbasids in Pamphylia, Crete, and on the border with Syria, but a Byzantine fleet of 85 ships did score a victory over the Arabs in 853. There were also many operations around the Aegean and off the Syrian coast by at least three more fleets, numbering 300 ships total. The Byzantines were able to successfully assault Damietta in Egypt in 853. In the 820s, Andalusian Arab pirates seized Crete, which Theoktistos attempted to regain in the first year of the regency, though unsuccessfully. Bardas was planning to sail there but was murdered on the instigation of Basil in 866. The recapture was not achieved until 961, long after Michael&#x27;s reign.

A conflict between the Byzantines and the First Bulgarian Empire occurred during 855 and 856. The Byzantine Empire wanted to regain its control over some areas of Thrace, including Philippopolis and the ports around the Gulf of Burgas on the Black Sea. Byzantine forces, led by the emperor and the caesar Bardas, were successful in reconquering a number of cities – Philippopolis, Develtus, Anchialus and Mesembria among them – as well as the region of Zagora. At the time of this campaign the Bulgarians were distracted by a war with the Franks under Louis the German and the Croatians. In 853, Khan Boris I of Bulgaria had allied himself to Duke Rastislav of Moravia against the Franks. The Bulgarians were heavily defeated by the Franks; following this, the Moravians changed sides and the Bulgarians then faced threats from Moravia.

Following an expedition led by Michael&#x27;s uncle and general, Petronas, against the Paulicians from the eastern frontier and the Arab borderlands in 856, the imperial government resettled them in Thrace, thus cutting them off from their coreligionists and populating another border region. The Paulicians, whose power centre was Tephrike, were heavily persecuted after the restoration of icons as they were deemed unorthodox. It was only in 872 that Christopher, Domestic of the Schools, defeated their leader Chrysocheir, and Tephrike was taken in 878. Michael was also responsible, as per the writings of Constantine VII, for the subjugation of the Slavs settled in the Peloponnese.
Michael took an active part in the wars against the Abbasids and their vassals on the eastern frontier from 856 to 863, and particularly in 857 when he sent an army of 50,000 men against Emir Umar al-Aqta of Melitene. In 859, he personally led a siege on Samosata, but in 860 had to abandon the expedition to repel a naval attack by the Rus&#x27; on Constantinople. The Rus&#x27; fleet plundered the outer suburbs of the city but left of their own volition, probably because they had acquired sufficient booty. The subsequent relationship with the Rus&#x27; was mixed; they requested a Byzantine mission which was short-lived, and engaged in further raids but also trade in the tenth century. It was only in the late tenth century that the Christianisation of the Rus&#x27; was achieved by Grand Prince Vladimir of Kiev.

Soon after the raid, Duke Rastislav requested a Byzantine mission, perhaps to secure a political counterweight to his neighbours; the Franks and the Bulgars. In 863, they sent Cyril and Methodius, who were from Thessalonika. They developed the first Slavic alphabet, the Glagolitic alphabet, and translated many religious texts into this new literary language. Their mission ceased when Rastislav died and other Slavic princes as well as the Franks pressured them. Nevertheless Cyril, Methodius and their disciples were influential in the newly Christian Bulgaria, where they were exiled to from Moravia in 885. They were installed at Ohrid and Pliska, where they were charged with the creation of a Slavic clergy and the expounding of Christianity in the Slavic vernacular, although Greek remained the liturgical and ceremonial language.

In 863, Petronas defeated and killed the emir of Melitene at the Battle of Lalakaon, and celebrated a triumph in the capital. The year 863 is seen as a turning point in the Arab-Byzantine wars, after which the Byzantines began to go on the offensive, leading to their triumph in the tenth century.

Within the decentralising Abbasid Caliphate, the Armenians, who were vassals of the Abbasids, even participating in the Sack of Amorion of 838, gained a degree of independence. Ashot I of Armenia was crowned king of Armenia in 884, and recognised by Michael and Basil as &quot;prince of princes&quot;. Friendly relations between Byzantium and Armenia continued into the tenth century, to the benefit of Byzantine eastward expansion.

===Photian schism and Christianisation of Bulgaria===
Bardas justified his usurpation of the regency by introducing various internal reforms. Under the influence of both Bardas and Photios, Michael presided over the reconstruction of ruined cities and structures, the reopening of closed monasteries, and the fostering of intellecutal life in the form of the reorganisation of the imperial university at the Maganaura palace under Leo the Mathematician.

Photios, originally a layman, had entered holy orders and was promoted to the position of patriarch on the dismissal of the troublesome Ignatios in 858. Ignatios was a castrated son of Michael I Rhangabe () and had deposed one of his predecessor Methodios&#x27; associates, Gregory Asbestas, the archbishop of Syracuse. Gregory appealed to the Bishop of Rome. While Gregory awaited a reply, Ignatios was deposed. In spring 859, Ignatios&#x27; supporters met in Constantinople and claimed they had deposed Photios, who responded with a synod attacking Ignatios. The stalemate prompted Michael and Photios to send an embassy to Pope Nicholas I, whose legates Radoald of Porto and Zacharias of Anagni approved the deposition of Ignatios at the Council of Constantinople of 861. However, perhaps partly due to the presence of Ignatios&#x27; supporters in Rome, Nicholas convened a council in 863 to overrule his legates, declaring that Photios and Asbestas were deposed, leading to the Photian schism. Michael then wrote a contemptuous letter about the alleged barbarity of Latin Rome.

Meanwhile, the potential conversion of Khan Boris I of Bulgaria () to Christianity under Frankish influence may have caused Michael and Bardas to threaten to invade Bulgaria. Anyhow, by the 860s, Boris converted to Christianity of the Byzantine rite. Michael stood as sponsor, by proxy, for Boris at his baptism. Boris took the additional name of Michael at the ceremony. The Byzantines also allowed the Bulgarians to reclaim the contested border region of Zagora. In 866, Boris appeared to have second thoughts and sought patronage from the Franks and Pope Nicholas I, requesting a Latin archbishop. He corresponded with Nicholas, who responded to him by expressing approval of Bulgar customs and severely criticising those of Byzantium. Photios responded by enumerating western doctrinal and disciplinary deviations in an encyclical, deposing Nicholas and requesting Louis the German&#x27;s aid in overthrowing him. Michael presided over a synod in 867 in which Photios and the three other eastern patriarchs excommunicated Pope Nicholas and condemned the Latin &quot;filioque&quot; clause concerning the procession of the Holy Spirit. The conflict over the patriarchal throne and supreme authority within the church was exacerbated by the success of the active missionary efforts launched by Photios. In the same year, Michael was assassinated and Basil reinstated Ignatios. Despite Ignatios&#x27; papal leanings in the Photian schism, he allowed Boris to procure a Byzantine-rite archbishop in 870, and the eastern patriarchs forcefully denied any Roman authority in Bulgaria. Byzantine cultural hegemony was secured, and relations between the two empires remained peaceful throughout Michael&#x27;s reign. The conversion of the Bulgarians has been evaluated as one of the greatest cultural and political achievements of the Byzantine Empire.

Under the guidance of Patriarch Photios, Michael sponsored the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodios to the Khazar Khagan in an effort to stop the expansion of Judaism among the Khazars. Although this mission was a failure, their next mission in 863 secured the conversion of Great Moravia and devised the Glagolitic alphabet for writing in Slavonic, thus allowing Slavic-speaking peoples to approach conversion to Orthodox Christianity through their own rather than an alien tongue.

===Rise of Basil the Macedonian and assassination of Michael===

Michael III&#x27;s marriage with Eudokia Dekapolitissa was childless, but the Emperor did not want to risk a scandal by attempting to marry his mistress Eudokia Ingerina, daughter of the Varangian (Norse) imperial guard Inger. The solution he chose was to have Ingerina marry his favorite courtier and chamberlain Basil the Macedonian. While Michael carried on his relationship with Ingerina, Basil was kept satisfied with the emperor&#x27;s sister Thekla, whom her brother retrieved from a monastery. According to Joseph Genesios, Michael met Basil when he heard of his wrestling ability, while other sources state that they met when Basil successfully broke in one of the Emperor&#x27;s horses. Either way, Basil was made &quot;prōtostratōr&quot; (head groom) when the incumbent was executed as a co-conspirator in a plot of Theodora against Bardas. Michael and Basil appeared to have a common interest in equestrianism, since Michael&#x27;s favourite pastimes included hunting and chariot-racing, to which end he built luxury stables.

Scholars are divided as to whether Michael and Basil were engaged in a homosexual relationship. One piece of evidence for this is Basil&#x27;s appointment as &quot;parakoimōmenos&quot;, which was usually for the chief eunuch and involved close proximity to the Emperor. It is clear that they had a close relationship, with Basil gaining increasing influence over Michael. In April 866, he convinced the Emperor that Bardas was conspiring against him and was duly allowed to murder Bardas while he was preparing to embark on an expedition to Crete. Now without serious rivals, Basil was crowned co-emperor on 26 May 866 and was adopted by the much younger Michael.
This curious development may have been intended to legitimise the eventual succession to the throne of Eudokia Ingerina&#x27;s son Leo, who was widely believed to be Michael&#x27;s son. Michael celebrated the birth of Leo with public chariot races, a sport he enthusiastically patronized and participated in.
If ensuring Leo&#x27;s legitimacy had been Michael&#x27;s plan, it backfired. Ostensibly troubled by the favour Michael was beginning to show to another courtier, named Basiliskianos, whom he threatened to raise as another co-emperor, Basil had Michael assassinated as he lay insensible in his bedchamber following a drinking bout on 24 September 867. Basil with a number of his male relatives, plus other accomplices, entered Michael&#x27;s apartment; the locks had been tampered with and no guard had been placed. Michael&#x27;s end was grisly; a man named John of Chaldia killed him, cutting off both the emperor&#x27;s hands with a sword before finishing him off with a thrust to the heart. Basil, as the sole remaining emperor (Basiliskianos had presumably been disposed of at the same time as Michael), automatically succeeded as the ruling &quot;basileus&quot;.

Michael&#x27;s remains were buried in the Philippikos Monastery at Chrysopolis on the Asian shore of the Bosphoros. When Leo VI became ruling emperor in 886, one of his first acts was to have Michael&#x27;s body exhumed and reburied, with great ceremony, in the imperial mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. This contributed to the suspicion held by the Byzantine public that Leo was (or at least believed himself to be) Michael&#x27;s son.
==Assessment and legacy==

The reign and personality of Michael are difficult to evaluate because of the hostile accounts written by Byzantine authors operating under Basil I () and his successors. Byzantine accounts describe Michael&#x27;s habitual drunkenness, his obsession with chariot racing and his orchestration of public displays mocking the processions and rituals of the church. His court&#x27;s politics were characterised by scandal including the assassinations of Bardas, Theoktistos and bizarre relationships with his wife, Eudokia Dekapolitissa, mistress, Eudokia Ingerina and Basil&#x27;s mistress, Michael&#x27;s own sister Thekla. And finally Michael&#x27;s own assassination at the hands of his trusted courtier Basil. The impression gained from Arab sources, however, is one of Michael as an active and often successful military commander. He was also very active in repairing the Walls of Constantinople. Chroniclers of Basil accuse Michael of allowing the registers of military personnel to decline, forcing Basil to undertake a major recruitment effort during his own reign, however the decline could be explained as a natural process due to aging.

As the end of the iconoclast period, Michael&#x27;s reign was the beginning of a period of religious peace with an established orthodoxy and liturgy, which was not to be interfered with by the emperor.

Despite the bias of the sources, there was a clear continuity in policy between Michael and Basil, which was in the security of the borders with the Abbasid Caliphate and First Bulgarian Empire, as well as opportunism regarding the Moravians, Armenians and Rus&#x27;.

Though Michael was allegedly prone to squander money, his reign stabilised the economy, and by the year 850 the empire&#x27;s annual revenues had increased to 3,300,000 &quot;nomismata&quot;. The definitive end to iconoclasm early in his reign led, unsurprisingly, to a renaissance in visual arts. The Empire made considerable advances in internal organisation and religious cohesion, and it had more than held its own against the Abbasid Caliphate. Most importantly Bulgaria had been transformed into a religious and cultural satellite of Byzantium. Much of the credit for these achievements, however, must go to Theodora and Theoktistos up to 855, and Bardas and Petronas thereafter.

==Family==

Michael III had no children by his wife Eudokia Dekapolitissa but was conjectured to have fathered one or two sons by his mistress Eudokia Ingerina, who was married to Basil I:
* Leo VI, who succeeded Basil I as emperor in 886
* Stephen I, patriarch of Constantinople.

<text>Hoosiers (released in some countries as Best Shot) is a 1986 American sports drama film written by Angelo Pizzo and directed by David Anspaugh in his feature directorial debut. It tells the story of a small-town Indiana high school basketball team and its journey to the state championship finals. It is inspired in part by the Milan High School team who won the 1954 state championship.

Gene Hackman stars as Norman Dale, a new coach with a spotty past. The film co-stars Barbara Hershey and Dennis Hopper, whose role as the basketball-loving town drunk earned him an Academy Award nomination. Jerry Goldsmith was also nominated for an Academy Award for his score. In 2001, &quot;Hoosiers&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==

In 1951, Norman Dale arrives in rural Hickory, Indiana. His old friend, high school principal Cletus Summers, has hired him as the civics and history teacher and as head basketball coach.

The townspeople, passionate about basketball, are disappointed that Hickory&#x27;s best player, Jimmy Chitwood, has left the team following the death of the previous coach, who had been a surrogate father to Jimmy. At a meet-and-greet, Dale tells the townspeople he used to coach college basketball. The next day, fellow teacher Myra Fleener warns Dale not to recruit Jimmy. She is encouraging Jimmy to focus solely on his studies so that he will have a future away from Hickory.

The small school has only seven players. At the first practice, Dale dismisses Buddy Walker for rudeness, causing another player, Whit Butcher, to walk out in protest. Dale begins drilling the others (Rade Butcher, Merle Webb, Everett Flatch, Strap Purl, and equipment manager Ollie McLellan) with fundamentals and conditioning but no scrimmages or shooting, much to the Huskers&#x27; dismay. Whit later apologizes to Dale and rejoins the team.

Dale instructs the Huskers to pass four times before shooting. During the season opener, Rade disobeys and repeatedly makes baskets without passing first. Dale benches him for the rest of the game, even when Merle fouls out, leaving only four Huskers on the floor. In a subsequent game, when a rival player jabs Dale in the chest during an on-court argument, Rade jumps to his defense and hits the player. During the altercation, Principal Summers, acting as assistant coach, suffers a mild heart attack. Dale further erodes community support by employing a slow, defensive style that does not immediately produce results. Dale also loses his temper on court and gets ejected from two games.

With Summers laid up, Dale asks former Husker Wilbur &quot;Shooter&quot; Flatch, Everett&#x27;s alcoholic father, to be his assistant coach, with the requirement that Shooter be sober during all games and practices. Shooter agrees, on the condition that Dale not get ejected from any more games. Dale&#x27;s choice of Shooter confounds the town and embarrasses Everett.

Mid-season, disgruntled townspeople decide to vote on dismissing Dale. Before the meeting, Fleener, sensing something amiss regarding Dale&#x27;s past, uncovers years-old information about his hitting a player and being banned from coaching. However, Fleener chooses not to reveal this fact to the townspeople, instead telling them at the meeting to give Dale another chance. Nevertheless, they vote to fire the coach. Then Jimmy Chitwood arrives and announces he will rejoin the team, but only if Dale remains as coach. A new vote is taken, and the residents overwhelmingly choose to keep Dale.

After Jimmy&#x27;s return, the reinvigorated Huskers rack up a series of wins. To prove to the townspeople (and to Shooter himself) Shooter&#x27;s value to the team, Dale intentionally gets ejected from a game. This forces Shooter to devise a play that helps Hickory win on a last-second shot. Shooter also regains the respect of his son, Everett.

Despite a setback when Shooter relapses, the team advances through the state tournament with Jimmy&#x27;s strong performance. Unsung players, such as short Ollie and devoutly religious Strap, also contribute. Hickory reaches the championship game in Indianapolis. At Butler Fieldhouse, and before the largest crowd they have ever seen, the Huskers face long odds to defeat the heavily favored defending state champion South Bend Central Bears, who have taller and more athletic players. After falling behind, Hickory fights their way back and ties the game with just a few seconds left. Dale calls a timeout and sets up a play where Jimmy will be a decoy for Merle, who will take the last shot. The Huskers look uncomfortable, and when Dale demands to know what&#x27;s wrong, Jimmy simply says, &quot;I&#x27;ll make it.&quot; Coach Dale nods in approval and sets up a new play for Jimmy. He scores just before the buzzer sounds, securing the victory for Hickory, the smallest school to ever win the Indiana state championship.

Sometime in the future, a boy shoots baskets in Hickory&#x27;s home gym. A large black-and-white team portrait with their state championship trophy is seen hanging on the wall, and a voiceover from Dale states, &quot;I love you guys.&quot;

==Cast==
==Inspiration==
 The film is inspired in part by the story of the 1954 Indiana state champions, Milan High School ( ). The phrase &quot;inspired by a true story&quot; is more appropriate than &quot;based on a true story&quot; because the two teams have little in common.

In most U.S. states, high school athletic teams are divided into different classes, usually based on the number of enrolled students, with separate state championship tournaments held for each classification. In 1954, Indiana conducted a single state basketball tournament for all its high schools. This practice continued until 1997.

Some plot points are similar to Milan&#x27;s real story. Like the film&#x27;s fictional Hickory High School, Milan was a very small high school in a rural, southern Indiana town. Both schools had undersized teams. Both Hickory and Milan won the state finals by 2 points: Hickory won 42–40, and Milan won 32–30. The last seconds of the &quot;Hoosiers&quot; state final are fairly close to the details of Milan&#x27;s 1954 final; the last basket in the film was made from virtually the same spot on the floor as Bobby Plump&#x27;s actual game-winner. The movie&#x27;s final game was filmed in the same gymnasium that hosted the 1954 Indiana state championship game, Butler University&#x27;s Hinkle Fieldhouse (called Butler Fieldhouse in 1954) in Indianapolis.

Unlike the film&#x27;s plot, the 1954 Milan Indians came into the season as heavy favorites and finished the &#x27;53–&#x27;54 regular season at 19–2. In addition, the 1952–1953 team went to the state semifinals, and they were considered a powerhouse going into the championship season despite the school&#x27;s small enrollment.

==Production==

During filming in the autumn of 1985, on location at Hinkle Fieldhouse, directors were unable to secure enough extras for shooting the final scenes even after casting calls through the Indianapolis media. To help fill the stands, they invited two local high schools to move a game to the Fieldhouse. Broad Ripple and Chatard, the alma mater of Maris Valainis who played the role of Jimmy Chitwood, obliged, and crowd shots were filmed during their actual game. Fans of both schools came out in period costumes to serve as extras and to supplement the hundreds of locals who had answered the call. At halftime and following the game, actors took to the court to shoot footage of the state championship scenes, including the game-winning shot by Hickory.

The film&#x27;s producers chose New Richmond, Indiana to serve as the fictional town of Hickory and recorded most of the film&#x27;s location shots in and around the community. Signs on the roads into New Richmond still recall its role in the film. In addition, the old schoolhouse in Nineveh was used for the majority of the classroom scenes and many other scenes throughout the film.

The home court of Hickory is located in Knightstown and is now known as the &quot;Hoosier Gym.&quot;

Pizzo and Anspaugh shopped the script for two years before they finally found investment for the project. Despite this seeming approval, the financiers approved a production budget of only $6 million, forcing the crew to hire most of the cast playing the Hickory basketball team and many of the extras from the local community around New Richmond. Gene Hackman also predicted that the film would be a &quot;career killer.&quot; Despite the small budget, dire predictions, and little help from distributor Orion Pictures, &quot;Hoosiers&quot; grossed over $28 million and received two Oscar nominations (Dennis Hopper for Best Supporting Actor and Jerry Goldsmith for Best Original Score).

Shortly after the film&#x27;s release, five of the actors who portrayed basketball players in the film were suspended by the NCAA from their real-life college basketball teams for three games. The NCAA determined that they had been paid to play basketball, making them ineligible.

==Soundtrack==
The music to &quot;Hoosiers&quot; was written by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith. Goldsmith used a hybrid of orchestral and electronic elements in juxtaposition to the 1950s setting to score the film. He also helped tie the music to the film by using recorded hits of basketballs on a gymnasium floor to serve as additional percussion sounds. &quot;Washington Post&quot; film critic Paul Attanasio praised the soundtrack, writing, &quot;And it&#x27;s marvelously (and innovatively) scored (by composer Jerry Goldsmith), who weaves together electronics with symphonic effects to create a sense of the rhythmic energy of basketball within a traditional setting.&quot;

The score would go on to garner Goldsmith an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score, though he ultimately lost to Herbie Hancock for &quot;Round Midnight&quot;. Goldsmith would later work with filmmakers Angelo Pizzo and David Anspaugh again on their successful 1993 sports film &quot;Rudy&quot;.

Until 2012, the soundtrack was primarily available under the European title &quot;Best Shot&quot;, with several of the film&#x27;s cues not included on the album. In 2012, Intrada Records released Goldsmith&#x27;s complete score, marking the first time the soundtrack has been released on CD in the United States.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;It may adhere to the sports underdog formula, but &quot;Hoosiers&quot; has been made with such loving craft, and features such excellent performances, that it&#x27;s hard to resist.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on A+ to F scale.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert praised the film, writing: &quot;What makes &quot;Hoosiers&quot; special is not its story but its details and its characters. Angelo Pizzo, who wrote the original screenplay, knows small-town sports. He knows all about high school politics and how the school board and the parents&#x27; groups always think they know more about basketball than the coach does. He knows about gossip, scandal and vengeance. And he knows a lot about human nature. All of his knowledge, however, would be pointless without Hackman&#x27;s great performance at the center of this movie. Hackman is gifted at combining likability with complexity — two qualities that usually don&#x27;t go together in the movies. He projects all of the single-mindedness of any good coach, but then he contains other dimensions, and we learn about the scandal in his past that led him to this one-horse town. David Anspaugh&#x27;s direction is good at suggesting Hackman&#x27;s complexity without belaboring it.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Janet Maslin echoed Ebert&#x27;s sentiments, writing, &quot;This film&#x27;s very lack of surprise and sophistication accounts for a lot of its considerable charm.&quot;

&quot;Washington Post&quot; critics Rita Kempley and Paul Attanasio both enjoyed the film, despite its perceived sentimentalism and lack of originality. Kempley wrote, &quot;Even though we&#x27;ve seen it all before, &quot;Hoosiers&quot; scores big by staying small.&quot; Attanasio pointed out some problems with the film: &quot;[It contains] some klutzy glitches in continuity, and a love story (between Hackman and a sterile, one-note Barbara Hershey) that goes nowhere. The action photography flattens the visual excitement of basketball (you can imagine what a Scorsese would do with it);&quot; but he noted the film&#x27;s &quot;enormous craftsmanship accumulates till you&#x27;re actually seduced into believing all its Pepperidge Farm buncombe. That&#x27;s quite an achievement.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Schickel praised the performance of Gene Hackman, writing that he was &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the 

Pat Graham of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; was the rare dissenter, writing of the film that 

===Accolades===
&quot;Hoosiers&quot; has been named by many publications as the best or one of the best sports movies ever made.

&quot;Hoosiers&quot; was ranked number 13 by the American Film Institute on its 100 Years... 100 Cheers list of most inspirational films. The film was the choice of the readers of &quot;USA Today&quot; as the best sports movie of all time. In 2001, &quot;Hoosiers&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; due in part to an especially large number of nominations from Indiana citizens.

In June 2008, AFI revealed its &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot; — the best ten films in ten classic American film genres — after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Hoosiers&quot; was acknowledged as the fourth best film in the sports genre.

A museum to commemorate the real-life achievements of the 1954 Milan team has been established.

In 2015, MGM partnered with the Indiana Pacers to create Hickory uniforms inspired by the film. The Pacers first wore the tribute uniforms during select games in the 2015–16 NBA regular season in honor of the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

In April 2017, Vice President (and former governor of Indiana) Mike Pence said that &quot;Hoosiers&quot; is the &quot;greatest sports movie ever made&quot; while traveling on a flight from Indonesia to Australia with a pool of journalists.

<text>Hospital is an 84-minute 1970 American documentary film directed by Frederick Wiseman, which explores the daily activities of the people at Metropolitan Hospital Center, a large-city hospital in New York City, with emphasis on its emergency ward and outpatient clinics.

The film won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Achievement in News Documentary Programming - Individuals and Outstanding Achievement in News Documentary Programming - Programs. In 1994, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. 

==Plot==
The film follows hospital staff and a variety patients in an episodic manner. The film is highly observational, using no voice-over narration or interviews. No names are formally given, and the hospital is only mentioned once as &quot;Metropolitan&quot; by a doctor on a phone call. The patients come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and social classes, but most are poor and marginalized. Doctors, nurses, police officers, and social workers attempt to aid patients with medical care and social welfare. The staff&#x27;s actions are often compassionate but limited by an overwhelmed public system. Among the patients are man who fears he has cancer, a neglected toddler who fell out a window, an art student who ingested an unknown drug and is suffering a bad trip, a gay, transsexual teenager trying to obtain welfare, and an elderly women who has a pulmonary embolism and is in critical condition. A group of patients attend a Catholic mass as the closing sequence.

<doc id="74377" wikidata="Q41640" url="?curid=74377" title="Michael II">
<text>Michael II (, ; 770 – 2 October 829), called the Amorian (, ) and the Stammerer (, or , ), reigned as Byzantine emperor from 25 December 820 to his death on 2 October 829, the first ruler of the Amorian dynasty.

Born in Amorium, Michael was a soldier, rising to high rank along with his colleague Leo V the Armenian (). He helped Leo overthrow and take the place of Emperor Michael I Rhangabe. However, after they fell out Leo sentenced Michael to death. Michael then masterminded a conspiracy which resulted in Leo&#x27;s assassination at Christmas in 820. Immediately he faced the long revolt of Thomas the Slav, which almost cost him his throne and was not completely quelled until spring 824. The later years of his reign were marked by two major military disasters that had long-term effects: the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Sicily, and the loss of Crete to Andalusian Arab pirates. Domestically, he supported and strengthened the resumption of official iconoclasm, which had begun again under Leo V.

==Early life==

Michael was born in Amorium, in Phrygia, into a Cappadocian family of professional peasant-soldiers who received land from the government for their military service. They may have been members of the sect of the &quot;Athinganoi&quot;.

Michael first rose to prominence as a close aide (&quot;spatharios&quot;) of the general Bardanes Tourkos, alongside his future antagonists Leo the Armenian and Thomas the Slav. He married Bardanes&#x27; daughter Thekla, while Leo married another daughter. Michael and Leo abandoned Bardanes shortly after he rebelled against Emperor Nikephoros I in 803, and they were rewarded with higher military commands: Michael was named the Emperor&#x27;s Count of the Tent. Michael was instrumental in Leo&#x27;s overthrow of Michael I Rhangabe in 813, after Rangabe&#x27;s repeated military defeats against the Bulgarians. Under Leo V, Michael was appointed to command the elite &quot;tagma&quot; of the Excubitors.
Thekla and Michael had only one known son, Theophilos (813 – 20 January 842). The existence of a daughter called Helena is possible but there is a contradiction between different sources. Helena is known as the wife of Theophobos, a patrician executed in 842 for conspiring to gain the throne for himself. George Hamartolos and Theophanes report him marrying the sister of the Empress Theodora. Joseph Genesius records Theophobos marrying the sister of the Emperor Theophilos. Whether Helena was sister or sister-in-law to Theophilos is thus unclear.

Michael became disgruntled with Leo V when he divorced Michael&#x27;s sister-in-law. In late 820, agents of the Postal Logothete uncovered a plot led by Michael to overthrow Leo, who then imprisoned Michael and sentenced him to death by burning. Empress consort Theodosia secured a postponement of the execution until after Christmas. This allowed Michael to rally undetected plotters to assassinate Leo on Christmas morning in the palace chapel and castrate his sons to prevent the continuation of his dynasty. Michael was immediately proclaimed emperor, while still wearing prison chains on his legs. Later the same day, he was crowned by Patriarch Theodotus I of Constantinople.

==Reign==
In his internal policy, Michael II supported iconoclasm, but he tacitly encouraged reconciliation with the iconodules, whom he generally stopped persecuting, allowing those exiled by Emperor Leo V the Armenian to return. These included the former patriarch Nikephoros, Anthony the Confessor, and Theodore the Stoudite, who failed, however, to persuade the emperor to abandon iconoclasm. Michael also did not restore the exiled iconodules to their previous positions. Theodore also requested permission to restore icons, resume relations with the bishop of Rome and recognise him as the head of all churches and therefore arbiter of disputes. Michael allowed iconodules to follow their conscience outside of Constantinople but did not make any further concessions, refusing to change imperial policy and banning discussion of the Council of Hieria (754), Second Council of Nicaea (787) and Council of Constantinople (815). When Patriarch Theodotos died in 821, Michael appointed the iconoclast Antony, bishop of Syllaion, against the aspirations of the iconodules.
===Revolt of Thomas the Slav: 821–823===
Michael&#x27;s accession prompted his former comrade-in-arms Thomas the Slav to set himself up as rival emperor in Anatolia to avenge Leo V. He had been made the &quot;tourmarchēs&quot; of the &quot;Foederati&quot; (a command in the Anatolic Theme) by Leo, and so bore at least nominal allegiance to him. The &quot;stratēgos&quot; of Sicily, Gregory, also proclaimed allegiance to Leo against Michael but was killed by soldiers under the &quot;tourmarchēs&quot; Euphemios which secured the loyalty of the Sicilian fleet to Michael. Thomas was supported by the Bucellarian, Paphlagonian and Cibyrrhaeot themes, while Michael held the European part of the Empire including the Opsikion (commanded by his relative Katakylas), Thracesian, Armeniac and Chaldian themes. To strengthen his position, he won the support of iconodules by stopping persecution, recalling exiled bishops and offering to reinstate Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople if he ignored the iconoclast controversy, which he refused to do.

In his quest for support, Thomas presented himself as a champion of the poor, reduced taxation, and concluded an alliance with al-Ma&#x27;mun of the Abbasid Caliphate, having himself crowned as emperor by the iconodule Greek Patriarch of Antioch, Job, in the Church of Cassian, then in Abbasid territory, taking the imperial name &quot;Constantine&quot;. Having amassed a large army, perhaps of 80,000 men as some sources report, Thomas marched into Thrace, winning the support of the theme as well as the Armeniacs and Chaldians. He besieged the capital in December 821. Although Thomas did not win over all the Anatolian themes, he secured the support of the naval theme and their ships, allowing him to intensify his siege of Constantinople. At this point, Michael&#x27;s usurpation was prevented only by the Walls of Constantinople.
In summer 822, the imperial fleet was able to destroy the rebel fleet with Greek fire. The primary sources disagree over whether a large Bulgar force under Khan Omurtag of Bulgaria was acting on Michael&#x27;s request or of its own accord, nevertheless in spring 823 it marched against Thomas, forcing fhim to lift his siege of Constantinople. The Bulgars defeated Thomas and many of his men began to desert, leading him to retreat to Arcadiopolis. Michael besieged Thomas in Arcadiopolis and starved him out, leading his supporters to hand him over to the Emperor, who put him to death. The last outbreak of resistance was put down in Anatolia in spring 824. By the end of 823, Michael&#x27;s power was firmly established and he had negotiated peace with the Bulgars despite their raiding and pillaging in Thrace during Thomas&#x27; revolt.
====Aftermath====
The warfare damaged the rural economy, in particular the region around Constantinople, and many Dalmatian coastal towns cast off imperial authority, which was not reinstated until the reign of Basil I (). Michael tried to reunite the Empire by pardoning many of Thomas&#x27; supporters and marrying the daughter of Constantine VI and Maria of Amnia, Euphrosyne, of the illustrious iconoclast Isaurian dynasty, although she herself was an iconodule. The marriage thus gave Michael&#x27;s rule a degree of legitimacy, but it caused some outrage since his first wife, Thekla had only recently died, and Euphrosyne was a nun. Nevertheless, the marriage helped to stabilise his authority and position. 

Michael attempted a reconciliation of the iconoclast controversy with Theodore and Nikephoros but they remained determined in their rejection of any compromise between iconoclasm and iconodulia. Theodore insisted that the matter should be resolved by a council presided over by Nikephoros or by the pope as a final arbiter. Nikephoros wrote his &quot;Refutation&quot; of the &quot;Acts&quot; of the 815 Council of Constantinople. Michael denied that the pope had any authority to intervene in the Eastern Church, so when the abbot Methodios, later Patriarch of Constantinople, arrived in Constantinople with a definition of orthodoxy from Pope Paschal I, he was considered a traitor and imprisoned. This was the only case of oppression of iconodules by Michael recorded in primary sources, and he generally pursued a benevolent policy, hoping he would be able to convert iconodules through dialogue. He wrote to the Carolingian Emperor, Louis the Pious (), defending the iconoclast position as represented in the synod of 815, and affirming belief in the veneration of relics. He gave an account of Thomas the Slav&#x27;s revolt and appealed to Louis to suppress eastern monks who were spreading anti-Byzantine propaganda in Rome. He also expressed his disapproval of certain practices associated with iconodules including the mixing of fragments of icons with the Eucharist, the use of icons as altar tables and as sponsors in baptism or tonsuring. This is corroborated by other reports of the extensive cult of images which had developed by the ninth century. Another case of Byzantine diplomacy with the Franks was the gift of the manuscript of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to Louis&#x27; court in 827, which was purposefully chosen because Louis&#x27; adviser Hilduin, abbot of Saint-Denis, chose Pseudo-Dionysius as his abbey&#x27;s patron saint.

===Campaigns against the Arabs===
In 824, Michael sent a fleet to raid the Syrian coast and sack Sozopetra. Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun mounted a combined land and naval raid in 825, but it did not cause much long-term damage and Michael did not retaliate, leaving the eastern frontier in a hostile stalemate.

Michael inherited a seriously weakened military and was unable to prevent the conquest of Crete in 826 by 10,000 Arab pirates from al-Andalus (who had 40 ships), or to recover the island with an expedition. The pirates had been exiled by the Umayyad emir of al-Andalus and captured Alexandria in 825 but were driven out. Crete was only recovered in 961, and until then remained a base for raiding parties into the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean. In 828, the Cibyrrhaeot navy and army achieved some successes, but was destroyed in a surprise attack and the &quot;stratēgos&quot; of the theme was killed. However in 829, the imperial fleet succeeded in driving the pirates out of the Cyclades.
Sicily lacked both a dominant political and culture centre, like Ravenna, Rome or Naples, and an autonomous local military elite, so its population were either divided or reacted passively during the crises of the 820s. Discontent began with the revolt of Thomas the Slav, and developed with Michael&#x27;s attempt to raise taxation in 826. An anti-imperial faction arose, led by the &quot;tourmarchēs&quot; of Sicily, Euphemios, who had led successful raids in North Africa. In 827, the &quot;stratēgos&quot; Constantine tried to arrest him, although his motive was unclear. It was likely in response to Euphemios&#x27; disloyalty, but later legends report that he wanted to punish Euphemios for abducting his niece from a nunnery and forcing her into marriage. In any event, word of Constantine&#x27;s intention reached Euphemios when he was raiding on the North African shore, and caused him to initiate a rebellion, seizing Syracuse, proclaiming himself emperor and then killing the &quot;stratēgos&quot; Constantine after defeating him at Catania. Some of Euphemios&#x27; supporters deserted him for the imperial government, and he was defeated by another garrison commander, which forced him to flee to the Aghlabid emir, Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya, who recognised his title and gave him a fleet. In June 827, a predominantly Arab force landed on the west of the island at Mazara, beginning an invasion. The Byzantines fared poorly at first, retaining control only of a few strongholds and Syracuse. With the death of Euphemios and the arrival of a new &quot;stratēgos&quot; in 829 came a series of successes which secured imperial authority by the end of Michael&#x27;s reign.

===Later years===
Michael maintained his policy of compromise and neutrality between iconoclasm and iconodulia until his death, and was supported throughout by Patriarch Antony. In October 829, Michael ordered the release of prisoners, reflecting his moderate policy. On 2 October, he died from kidney failure. He was succeeded peacefully by his son Theophilos, along with his stepmother Euphrosyne since he was only seventeen years old.
==Assessment and legacy==
Because of his iconoclasm, Michael was not popular among the clergy, who depicted him as an ignorant and poorly educated peasant, but he was a competent statesman and administrator. Empress Theodora () defended her husband Theophilos, which mitigated the &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; against him and his father Michael, nevertheless the later iconodule sources were highly critical of them. The civil war, which was the most ferocious since the Heraclian revolt (608–610), gravely weakened the imperial government, which saw the beginning of the century-long struggle over Sicily with the Aghlabids and the loss of Crete to Arab pirates from al-Andalus. Both islands became bases for future raids of the coasts of southern Italy and in the Aegean, as well as the conquest of Bari in 842. However, by the end of Michael&#x27;s reign he had begun a restoration of the Byzantine military. The system of government and military built by Michael enabled the Empire under his grandson Michael III to gain ascendancy in their struggles with the Abbasids and to withstand all the vicissitudes of Byzantine palace life. Michael II&#x27;s direct descendants, the Amorian dynasty followed by the so-called Macedonian dynasty, ruled the Empire for more than two centuries, inaugurating the Byzantine Renaissance of the 9th and 10th centuries.

Although he arranged the assassination of Leo V, Michael continued with his form of iconoclasm in what came to be known as the &quot;second&quot; Byzantine iconoclasm. This iconoclasm was less intransigent than the first; iconodules were not accused of idolatry and images that were suspended high up (and thus unable to be venerated) were permitted to remain in churches. Nevertheless, many iconodule clergymen remained staunchly opposed, especially Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople who was deposed by Leo V but remained active in polemics against imperial authority during Michael&#x27;s reign.

<doc id="74378" wikidata="Q41654" url="?curid=74378" title="Michael IV the Paphlagonian">
<text>Michael IV the Paphlagonian (, &quot;Mikhaēl ho Paphlagōn&quot;; c. 1010 – 10 December 1041) was Byzantine Emperor from 11 April 1034 to his death on 10 December 1041.

The son of a peasant, Michael worked as a money changer until he was found a job at court by his brother John the Orphanotrophos. He caught the eye of the empress Zoë Porphyrogenita and they began a tempestuous and flagrant affair. It is believed that they conspired to murder her husband, Emperor Romanos III Argyros, who died in 1034. Michael and Zoë were married the same day and Michael was crowned emperor the day after.

Michael, handsome and energetic, had poor health and entrusted most of the business of government to his brother. He distrusted Zoë and went to lengths to ensure that he did not suffer the same fate as his predecessor. The fortunes of the Empire under Michael&#x27;s reign were mixed. His most triumphant moment came in 1041 when he led the imperial army against Bulgarian rebels. He returned from this victory, but died a few months later.

==Early life and career==
Michael came from a family of Greek peasants from Paphlagonia. He worked in Constantinople as a money changer, and was rumored to have a secret second occupation as a counterfeiter of coins. One of Michael&#x27;s brothers, John the Orphanotrophos, also known as John the Eunuch, was the &quot;parakoimomenos&quot;, a senior courtier who presided over the women&#x27;s quarters at the imperial palace. John obtained jobs for several of his younger brothers in the court.

Romanos Argyros became emperor of the Byzantine Empire as Romanos III in 1028. &quot;As a ruler he had no ability whatsoever&quot;, and his private life was troubled by his failure to conceive a child with his wife Empress Zoë. The couple became alienated, with Romanos taking a mistress and Zoë engaging in a number of affairs. She was enamoured of the handsome young Michael to the extent of flaunting him openly and speaking of making him emperor. Romanos confronted Michael, who denied the accusations, swearing his innocence on holy relics. His suspicions assuaged, Romanos allowed Michael to become his personal servant in 1033.
Romanos became ill in early 1034, and it was widely believed that Zoë and Michael had poisoned him. On 11 April Romanos was found dying in his bath. According to court official and later chronicler Michael Psellus, some of his retinue had &quot;held his head for a long time beneath the water, attempting at the same time to strangle him&quot;. John Scylitzes writes as a simple fact that Romanos was drowned on Michael&#x27;s orders. Matthew of Edessa&#x27;s account has Zoë poisoning Romanos. Zoë and Michael were married on the day that Romanos III died. The next day the couple summoned the Patriarch Alexios I to officiate at the coronation of the new emperor. Alexios refused to co-operate until the payment of 50 pounds of gold helped change his mind. He crowned Michael as the new Emperor of the Romans as Michael IV.
==Reign==

===Domestic policies===

Michael IV was handsome, clever and generous, but epilepsy and a lack of education prevented him from assuming many of his imperial duties. He was initially reliant on others to direct the government in his name, and afforded significant responsibilities to his brother John, who had already become an influential minister under Constantine VIII and Romanos III. Zoë was disappointed in her hopes that Michael would prove a more devoted husband than Romanos. Fearing that the empress might turn on him as she had turned on his predecessor, Michael excluded her from politics and confined her to the palace &quot;gynaeceum&quot; (women&#x27;s quarters). There a watch was kept on Zoë’s activities, and Michael seldom visited her.

John&#x27;s reforms of the army and financial system revived the strength of the Empire against its foreign enemies but increased taxes, which caused discontent among the nobility and the commons. John&#x27;s monopoly of the government and the introduction of such taxes as the &quot;Aerikon&quot; led to several conspiracies against him and Michael. Poor harvests and famine caused by bad weather and by a locust plague in 1035 exacerbated discontent. When Michael tried to exercise a measure of control over Aleppo, the local citizens drove off the imperial governor. There were revolts at Antioch, Nicopolis and in Bulgaria.

In 1034 Michael ordered the arrest of Constantine Dalassenos on suspicion of treason, accused of fomenting insurrection at Antioch. In 1037 Zoë conspired to have John the Eunuch poisoned. In 1038 Michael&#x27;s brother, Constantine, suppressed an uprising of the armies in Anatolia. In 1040 a conspiracy involved the priest Michael Keroularios, who became a monk to save his life and was elected Patriarch of Constantinople under Michael&#x27;s successor. During the Bulgarian uprising of 1040, John the Eunuch arrested suspected plotters in Anatolia and Constantinople who were hoping to take advantage of the turmoil but was unable to capture the Strategos (military governor) of Theodosiopolis, who joined the rebellion and attempted to capture Thessalonica.

===Foreign and military affairs===

In terms of military affairs, Michael&#x27;s reign began poorly. The Arabs sacked Myra, the Serbs threw off Byzantine authority and the Pechenegs raided almost at will up to the gates of Thessalonica. The situation was soon stabilised: on the eastern frontier, Arab pirates were either captured or killed; the Byzantines captured the Muslim fortress of Perkri, on the eastern shore of Lake Van; Edessa was relieved after a long siege and eventually ceded to the empire in 1037.

On the western front, Michael and John ordered the general George Maniakes to conquer the Emirate of Sicily. In 1038 Maniakes landed in southern Italy and soon captured Messina. He then defeated the scattered Arab forces and captured towns in the west and south of the island. By 1040 he had stormed and taken Syracuse. He almost succeeded in driving the Arabs from the island, but Maniakes then fell out with his Lombard allies, while his Norman mercenaries, unhappy with their pay, abandoned the Byzantine general and raised a revolt on the Italian mainland, resulting in the temporary loss of Bari. Maniakes was about to strike against them when he was recalled by John the Eunuch on suspicion of conspiracy. After Maniakes&#x27;s recall, most of the Sicilian conquests were lost and an expedition against the Normans suffered several defeats, although Bari was eventually recaptured.

In the north, Pecheneg pressure had initially forced the Serbs to seek the protection of the Byzantine Empire and acknowledge Byzantine authority. In 1040 the Serbs again revolted, as did the Bulgarians. This uprising was partly caused by the heavy taxation in coin (and not, as before, in kind) imposed on Bulgaria by John&#x27;s policies. It also aimed at the restoration of the Bulgarian state under the leadership of Peter Delyan. The rebels seized Belgrade, proclaimed Delyan Emperor of Bulgaria and then quickly took Scupi. Michael IV made things worse by removing from command the &quot;doux&quot; of Dyrrhachium, who had been marching against Peter Delyan, accusing him of a conspiracy. His troops, largely Bulgarian, joined the revolt and Delyan laid siege to Thessalonica. Dyrrhachium had been lost and Delyan defeated the &quot;Strategos&quot; of Hellas. Most of the theme of Nicopolis had risen up against Michael, disgusted with the greed of John the Eunuch.

At this point, Michael&#x27;s epilepsy left him half paralysed and he developed a severe case of dropsy, which caused his legs to become gangrenous. When he announced that he intended to lead the imperial army against the Bulgarians, his advisors were aghast. In 1041 Michael set off towards Macedonia with an army of 40,000 men, assisted by Norse mercenaries, including the future King Harald III of Norway. Gathering his forces at Mosynopolis the Emperor waited for the Bulgarian army. The military position of the Byzantines was aided by internal dissension among the Bulgarians. Michael advanced, relieving Thessalonica then bringing the Bulgarians to battle, defeating them and capturing Delyan. Michael pushed his army aggressively into Bulgaria. The largest remaining Bulgarian contingent was at Prilapon in a fortified camp commanded by Manuel Ivats. The Byzantines stormed the camp, scattered the Bulgarians and captured Ivats. The rigours of the campaign brought Michael close to death, but he was able to return to Constantinople in triumph.
===Final illness and death===
Despite his triumphant campaign, it was now clear to all that Michael was dying. He sought heavenly aid by visiting the shrine of Saint Demetrius at Thessalonica and by building or rebuilding churches. In 1039 he gave monetary gifts to every monk and priest in the empire and also to any parents who made him a godfather to their children. John the Eunuch, eager to ensure that power remained in his hands, forced Zoë to adopt Michael&#x27;s and his nephew, their sister&#x27;s son, also named Michael. After taking Holy Orders, on 10 December 1041 Michael IV died, refusing to the last to see his wife, who begged that she be allowed to visit him one more time. His nephew was crowned emperor as Michael V.

<text>Michael V Kalaphates (, &quot;Michaḗl Kalaphátēs&quot;) was Byzantine emperor for four months in 1041–1042. He was the nephew and successor of Michael IV and the adoptive son of Michael IV&#x27;s wife Empress Zoe. He was popularly called &quot;the Caulker&quot; (&quot;Kalaphates&quot;) in accordance with his father&#x27;s original occupation.

==Family==
Michael V was the son of a couple named Stephen and Maria. His birth date is not known, but is sometimes given as 1015, probably because he was considered &quot;young&quot; in 1035. Michael&#x27;s mother was a sister of the Byzantine emperor Michael IV and Stephen had been a caulker before becoming an admiral under Michael IV and then botching an expedition to Sicily. Although the emperor preferred another of his nephews, the future Michael V was advanced as heir to the throne by his other uncle John the Orphanotrophos and the Empress Zoe. In 1035, Michael IV granted him the title of &quot;kaisar&quot; (caesar), and, together with Zoe, adopted his nephew as a son. Michael IV died on 10 December 1041 and Michael V was proclaimed emperor three days later by Zoe. 

==Reign==

Determined to rule on his own, Michael V came into conflict with his uncle John the Orphanotrophos, whom he almost immediately banished to a monastery. Michael now reversed his uncle&#x27;s decisions, recalling the nobles and courtiers who had been exiled during the previous reign, including the future patriarch Michael Keroularios and the general George Maniakes. Maniakes was promptly sent back to Southern Italy in order to contain the advance of the Normans.

On the night of 18 April to 19 April 1042, Michael V banished his adoptive mother and co-ruler Zoe, for plotting to poison him, to the island of Principo, thus becoming sole emperor. His announcement of the event in the morning led to a popular revolt; the palace was surrounded by a mob demanding Zoe&#x27;s immediate restoration. The demand was met, and Zoe was brought back, though still in a nun&#x27;s habit. Presenting Zoe to the crowds in the Hippodrome did not quell the public&#x27;s outrage over Michael&#x27;s actions. The masses attacked the palace from multiple directions. The emperor&#x27;s soldiers attempted to fight them off and by April 21, an estimated three thousand people from both sides had died. Once inside the palace, the mob pillaged valuables and tore up the tax rolls. Also on 21 April 1042 Zoe&#x27;s sister Theodora, who had been removed from her nunnery against her will earlier in the uprising, was declared Empress. In response, Michael fled to seek safety in the monastery of the Stoudion together with his remaining uncle, Constantine. Although he had taken monastic vows, Michael was arrested, blinded and sent to a monastery by then-Chief of the Varangian Guard, Harald Hardrada.

<text>The Hospital is a 1971 American absurdist satirical black comedy film directed by Arthur Hiller and starring George C. Scott as Dr. Herbert Bock. It was written by Paddy Chayefsky, who was awarded the 1972 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Chayefsky also narrates the film and was one of the producers; he had complete control over the casting and content of the film.

In 1995, &quot;The Hospital&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
At a Manhattan teaching hospital, the life of Dr. Bock, the Chief of Medicine, is in disarray: he has left his wife, his children don&#x27;t talk to him, and his once-beloved teaching hospital is falling apart.

The hospital is dealing with the sudden deaths of two doctors and a nurse. These are attributed to coincidental or unavoidable failures to provide accurate treatment.

At the same time, administrators must deal with a protest against the hospital&#x27;s annexation of an adjacent and decrepit apartment building. The annexation is to be used for a drug rehabilitation center; the building&#x27;s current occupants demand that the hospital find them replacement housing before the building is demolished despite the building being condemned sometime before.

Dr. Bock admits to impotence and has thoughts of suicide, but falls in love with Barbara Drummond, a patient&#x27;s daughter who came with her father from Mexico for his treatment. This temporarily gives Dr. Bock something to live for, after Barbara challenges and engages with him.

The deaths are discovered to have been caused by Barbara&#x27;s father as retribution for the &quot;inhumanity&quot; of modern medical treatment. Drummond takes no personal responsibility, claiming his victims would have been saved if they had received prompt, appropriate treatment, but they did not. Dr. Bock and Barbara use a final, accidental death of a doctor at the hospital to cover Drummond&#x27;s misdeeds. Barbara makes plans to fly with her father back to Mexico. Dr. Bock at first intends to go with them, but at the last minute, driven by his sense of obligation, he insists on staying behind at the hospital so that it will not descend into total chaos.

==Cast==
== Production ==
It was filmed at Metropolitan Hospital Center in New York. Frank Thompson designed the costumes for the film.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film earned $9 million in North American rentals.

===Critical response===
When &quot;The Hospital&quot; was released, film critic Roger Ebert lauded the film, writing, &quot;&quot;The Hospital&quot; is a better movie than you may have been led to believe. It has been criticized for switching tone in midstream, but maybe it&#x27;s only heading for deeper, swifter waters. [...] Chayevsky&#x27;s [&quot;sic&quot;] bizarre and unexpected ending suggests that men—even madmen—can still use institutions for their own private purpose.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; found the film “a very serious (in fact, perhaps, a little too serious), very funny melodramatic farce ... [it] is not, as you might be led to believe, the sort of pious, inside-institution literature that Arthur Hailey grinds out to satisfy the book clubs, if not the muses, nor is it really one of those malpractice horror stores that are so helpful in obtaining lecture tours for medical men ... the writer’s intelligence, and his only recently exercised gift for fantasy ... save ‘The Hospital’ from a couple of serious seizures that, toward the end, overtake the movie when it feels called upon to certify its serious purposes and to straighten out its peculiar plot ... Mr. Hiller ... obtains excellent performances from his stars [and] has perfectly cast the film down to roles that are so small they depend—I suspect—as much on natural mannerism as on acting talent.”

More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mildly positive review, writing, &quot;The gallows humor was the melodramatic farce&#x27;s saving grace; the film uses its razor-sharp instruments to cut into the hides of the insensitive institutionalized health care providers like Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Sicko&quot; does in 2007 to the fat-cat HMOs. My major gripe was that it could have been better, as Chayefsky delivered his part of the bargain and so did Scott; nevertheless the pic flattens out as the director increasingly loses his way in all the bitterness and invented horror stories and leaves us dangling over how to get out of such an irredeemable world (where modern man is perceived as forgotten in death).&quot;

The film has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.8/10, based on 12 reviews.

<text>Michael VI Bringas (; died ), also called Stratiotikos (, &quot;the military one, the warlike&quot;) and the Old (, &quot;geron&quot;), reigned as Byzantine emperor from 1056 to 1057.

==Career==

Apparently a relative of the powerful courtier Joseph Bringas (influential during the reign of Romanos II), Michael Bringas was an elderly patrician (hence the nickname &quot;Geron&quot;) and a member of the court bureaucracy when he ascended to the throne. He had formerly served as a military finance minister (&quot;logothetes tou stratiotikou&quot;, hence the epithet &quot;Stratiotikos&quot;). Michael Bringas was chosen for his pliability by the empress Theodora as her successor shortly before her death on 31 August 1056. The appointment had been secured through the influence of Leo Paraspondylos, Theodora&#x27;s most trusted adviser, who remained chief minister.

Although Michael managed to survive a conspiracy organized by Theodosios, a nephew of the former emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, he was faced with the disaffection of the military aristocracy. His most costly error was to ignore the perceived rights of the general Nikephoros Bryennios, who had been demoted and reduced to poverty after falling out with the Empress Theodora; Michael restored Bryennios&#x27;s military rank, but not his confiscated wealth and estates. Michael compounded his error by rebuffing Bryennios after he had already ordered the restored general to lead a division of 3,000 men to reinforce the army in Cappadocia. From here Bryennios began plotting to overthrow Michael VI, and it was his capture that precipitated the military nobility to rally around the general Isaac Komnenos, who was proclaimed emperor in Paphlagonia on 8 June 1057.

Soon after, the government&#x27;s army was routed at the Battle of Petroe (20 August 1057) near Nicaea, and Isaac Komnenos advanced on Constantinople. Michael VI attempted to negotiate with the rebels through the famous courtier Michael Psellos, offering to adopt Isaac as his son and to grant him the title of &quot;kaisar&quot; (caesar), but his proposals were publicly rejected. Privately Isaac showed himself more open to negotiation, and he was promised the status of co-emperor. However, during the course of these secret negotiations, a riot in favor of Isaac broke out in Constantinople. Patriarch Michael Keroularios convinced Michael VI to abdicate in Isaac&#x27;s favor on 30 August 1057. The emperor duly followed the patriarch&#x27;s advice and became a monk. He retired to his private home and died there shortly thereafter.

<text>The House in the Middle is the title of two American documentary film shorts (13 minutes), respectively from 1953 and 1954, which showed the effects of a nuclear bomb test on a set of three small houses.

==1953 version==

The black-and-white 1953 film was created by the Federal Civil Defense Administration to attempt to show that a clean, freshly painted house (the middle house) is more likely to survive a nuclear attack than its poorly maintained counterparts (the right and left houses).

==1954 version==

A color version was released the next year by the National Clean Up – Paint Up – Fix Up Bureau, a &quot;bureau&quot; invented by the National Paint, Varnish and Lacquer Association trade group (now known as the American Coatings Association).
==Production==
Footage for the film was recorded during the Upshot-Knothole Encore test at the Nevada Test Site on May 8, 1953.

==Legacy==
In 2001, the Library of Congress deemed the 1954 film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

It was featured on Rick Prelinger&#x27;s 2004 collage film &quot;Panorama Ephemera&quot;.

<text>Morgan Stanley is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered at 1585 Broadway in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. With offices in 41 countries and more than 90,000 employees, the firm&#x27;s clients include corporations, governments, institutions, and individuals. Morgan Stanley ranked No. 61 in the 2023 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue and in the same year ranked #30 in Forbes Global 2000.

The original Morgan Stanley, formed by J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. partners Henry Sturgis Morgan (a grandson of J.P. Morgan), Harold Stanley, and others, came into existence on September 16, 1935, in response to the Glass–Steagall Act, which required the splitting of American commercial and investment banking businesses. In its first year, the company operated with a 24% market share (US$1.1 billion) in public offerings and private placements.

The current Morgan Stanley is the result of the merger of the original Morgan Stanley with Dean Witter Discover &amp; Co. in 1997. Dean Witter&#x27;s chairman and CEO, Philip J. Purcell, became the chairman and CEO of the newly merged &quot;Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover &amp; Co.&quot; The new firm changed its name back to &quot;Morgan Stanley&quot; in 2001. The main areas of business for the firm today are institutional securities, wealth management and investment management. The bank is considered systemically important by the Financial Stability Board.

Morgan Stanley is a financial services corporation that, through its affiliates and subsidiaries, advises, and originates, trades, manages, and distributes capital for institutions, governments, and individuals. The company operates in three business segments: Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management.

==History==
===Early years (1935–1997)===
Morgan Stanley traces its roots to J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. After the U.S. Congress passed the Glass–Steagall Act in 1933, it was no longer possible for a corporation to have investment banking and commercial banking businesses under a single holding entity. J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. chose the commercial banking business over the investment banking business. As a result, some of the employees of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., most notably Henry S. Morgan and Harold Stanley, left J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and joined others from the Drexel partners to form Morgan Stanley. The firm formally opened its doors for business on September 16, 1935, at 2 Wall Street, New York City, just down the street from J.P. Morgan. The firm was involved with the distribution of 1938 US$100 million (~$ in ) of debentures for the United States Steel Corporation as the lead underwriter. The firm also obtained the distinction of being the lead syndicate in the 1939 U.S. rail financing. The firm went through a reorganization in 1941 to allow for more activity in its securities business.

The firm was led by Perry Hall, the last founder to lead Morgan Stanley, from 1951 until 1961. During this period, the firm co-managed the World Bank&#x27;s triple-A-rated bonds offering of 1952, as well as coming up with General Motors&#x27; US$300 million debt issue, US$231 million IBM stock offering, and the US$250 million AT&amp;T&#x27;s debt offering.

Morgan Stanley credits itself with having created the first viable computer model for financial analysis in 1962, thereby starting a new trend in the field of financial analysis. Future president and chairman Dick Fisher contributed to the computer model as a young employee, learning the Fortran and COBOL programming languages at IBM. In 1967, it established the Morgan &amp; Cie, International in Paris in an attempt to enter the European securities market. The firm acquired Brooks, Harvey &amp; Co., Inc. in 1967 and established a presence in the real estate business. The sales and trading business is believed to be the brainchild of Bob Baldwin.

In 1996, Morgan Stanley acquired Van Kampen American Capital.

=== After the merger (1997–present) ===

On February 5, 1997, the company merged with Dean Witter Discover &amp; Co., the spun-off financial services business of Sears Roebuck. Dean Witter&#x27;s chairman and CEO, Philip J. Purcell, continued to hold the same roles in the newly merged &quot;Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover &amp; Co.&quot; Morgan Stanley&#x27;s president John J. Mack became the firm&#x27;s president and chief operating officer. In 1998, the name of the firm was changed to &quot;Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co.&quot; Originally, the name was chosen to be the combination of the two predecessor companies to avoid tension between the two firms. Eventually, in 2001 &quot;Dean Witter&quot; was further dropped and the name became &quot;Morgan Stanley&quot; for unrevealed reasons. The merged firm began expanding overseas operations: in 1999, Mack set up a joint venture in India with local partner JM Financial.

Morgan Stanley had offices located on 35 floors across buildings 1, 2, and 5 of the World Trade Center, and was the largest tenant of the WTC complex. Most of these offices had been inherited from Dean Witter which had occupied the space since the mid-1980s. The firm lost 13 employees during the September 11 attacks in 2001 (Thomas F. Swift, Wesley Mercer, Jennifer de Jesus, Joseph DiPilato, Nolbert Salomon, Godwin Forde, Steve R. Strauss, Lindsay C. Herkness, Albert Joseph, Jorge Velazquez, Titus Davidson, Charles Laurencin and Security Director Rick Rescorla) in the towers, while 2,687 were successfully evacuated by Rick Rescorla. The surviving employees moved to temporary headquarters in the vicinity. In 2005 Morgan Stanley moved 2,300 of its employees back to lower Manhattan, at that time the largest such move.
In 2003, New York–Presbyterian Hospital named the Morgan Stanley Children&#x27;s Hospital in recognition of the firm&#x27;s sponsorship of the hospital, which largely funded its construction through philanthropy. The initiative began under CEO Philip J. Purcell and was completed under John Mack. Employees at the firm have been involved with the hospital since the 1990s and personally donated to the construction of the current child-friendly building, which opened in November 2003.

The company found itself in the midst of a management crisis starting in March 2005 that resulted in a loss of the firm&#x27;s staff. Purcell resigned as CEO of Morgan Stanley in June 2005 when a highly public campaign by former Morgan Stanley partners threatened to damage the firm and challenged his refusal to aggressively increase leverage, increase risk, enter the sub-prime mortgage business and make expensive acquisitions; the same strategies that forced Morgan Stanley into massive write-downs, related to the subprime mortgage crisis, by 2007.

On December 19, 2006, Morgan Stanley announced the spin-off of its Discover Card unit. The bank completed the spinoff of Discover Financial on June 30, 2007.

In February 2007, Morgan Stanley announced the end of its Indian joint venture: the bank acquired its local partner&#x27;s stake in the institutional brokerage business, and sold its own stake in the other businesses. The bank then set up a wholly-owned subsidiary; the country head of Investment Management, Narayan Ramachandran, became CEO of the new subsidiary. Aisha de Sequeira, a managing director in the Mergers and Acquisitions group, was made Head of Investment Banking.

To cope with the write-downs during the subprime mortgage crisis, Morgan Stanley announced on December 19, 2007, that it would receive a US$5 billion capital infusion from the China Investment Corporation in exchange for securities that would be convertible to 9.9% of its shares in 2010.

The bank&#x27;s Process Driven Trading unit was among several on Wall Street caught in a short squeeze, reportedly losing nearly $300 million in one day. The bubble&#x27;s subsequent collapse was considered to be a central component of the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

The bank was contracted by the United States Treasury in August 2008 to advise the government on potential rescue strategies for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Within days, Morgan Stanley itself was at risk of failure, with rapidly changing prospects, regulatory model and ownership stakes over the course of four weeks from mid-September to mid-October 2008.

The bank Morgan Stanley was reported to have lost over 80% of its market value during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. On September 17, 2008, the British evening-news analysis program &quot;Newsnight&quot; reported that Morgan Stanley was facing difficulties after a 42% slide in its share price in two days. CEO John J. Mack wrote in a memo to staff &quot;we&#x27;re in the midst of a market controlled by fear and rumours and short-sellers are driving our stock down.&quot; By September 19, 2008, the share price had slid 57% in four days, and the company was said to have explored merger possibilities with CITIC, Wachovia, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Banco Santander and Nomura. At one point, Hank Paulson offered Morgan Stanley to JPMorgan Chase at no cost, but JPMorgan&#x27;s Jamie Dimon refused the offer.

Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the last two major investment banks in the US, both announced on September 22, 2008, that they would become traditional bank holding companies regulated by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve&#x27;s approval of their bid to become banks ended the ascendancy of securities firms, 75 years after Congress separated them from deposit-taking lenders, and capped weeks of chaos that sent Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. into bankruptcy and led to the rushed sale of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to Bank of America Corp.

MUFG Bank, Japan&#x27;s largest bank, invested $9 billion in a direct purchase of a 21% ownership stake in Morgan Stanley on September 29, 2008. The payment from MUFG was supposed to be wired electronically; however, because it needed to be made on an emergency basis on Columbus Day when banks were closed in the US, MUFG cut a US$9 billion physical check, the largest amount written via physical check at the time. The physical check was accepted by Robert A. Kindler, Global Head of Mergers and Acquisitions and Vice Chairman of Morgan Stanley, at the offices of Wachtell Lipton. Concerns over the completion of the Mitsubishi deal during the October 2008 stock market volatility caused a dramatic fall in Morgan Stanley&#x27;s stock price to levels last seen in 1994. It recovered once Mitsubishi UFJ&#x27;s 21% stake in Morgan Stanley was completed on October 14, 2008.

Morgan Stanley borrowed $107.3 billion from the Fed during the 2008 crisis, the most of any bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News Service and published August 22, 2011.

In 2009, Morgan Stanley purchased Smith Barney from Citigroup and the new broker-dealer operates under the name Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the largest wealth management business in the world.

In November 2013, Morgan Stanley announced that it would invest $1 billion (~$ in ) to help improve affordable housing as part of a wider push to encourage investment in efforts that aid economic, social and environmental sustainability.

In July 2014, Morgan Stanley&#x27;s Asian private equity arm announced it had raised around $1.7 billion (~$ in ) for its fourth fund in the area.

In December 2015, it was reported that Morgan Stanley would be cutting around 25 percent of its fixed income jobs before month end. In January 2016, the company reported that it had offices in &quot;more than&quot; 43 countries.

In October 2020, the company completed its acquisition of E*Trade, a deal announced in February 2020 for $13 billion, the biggest acquisition by a U.S. bank since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

In March 2021, Morgan Stanley completed its acquisition of Eaton Vance, a deal announced in October 2020. With the addition of Eaton Vance, Morgan Stanley now had $5.4 trillion of client assets across its Wealth Management and Investment Management segments.

The firm conducted layoffs in December 2022, and Bloomberg announced the firm expected more layoffs in mid-2023.

On May 2, 2023, an individual familiar with the matter reported that Morgan Stanley has outlined its intention to reduce approximately 3,000 positions by the end of June. The projected reduction constitutes roughly 5 percent of the bank&#x27;s overall workforce, with financial advisors and support staff exempted from these staff cuts.

In October 2024, Morgan Stanley entered into a 40,000-tonne carbon dioxide removal purchase agreement with Climeworks, a direct air capture startup company, for an undisclosed price.

In January 2025, Morgan Stanley announced that it had decided to leave the Net- Zero Banking Alliance. Although this decision was made, Morgan Stanley remains vigilant in its commitment towards helping the world transition to net-zero carbon emissions.

==Organization==
The company&#x27;s 3 divisions are as follows:

===Institutional Securities Group===
Morgan Stanley&#x27;s Institutional Securities is the most profitable business segment. This business segment provides institutions with investment banking services such as capital raising and financial advisory services such as mergers and acquisitions advisory, restructurings, real estate and project finance, and corporate lending. The segment also encompasses the Equities and the Fixed Income divisions of the firm; trading is anticipated to maintain its position as the &quot;engine room&quot; of the company. Among the major U.S. banks, Morgan Stanley sources the highest portion of revenues from fixed-income underwriting, which was reported at 6.0% of total revenue in FY12.

=== Wealth Management ===
The Global Wealth Management Group provides stockbrokerage and investment advisory services. This segment provides financial and wealth planning services to its clients, who are primarily high-net-worth individuals.

On January 13, 2009, the Global Wealth Management Group was merged with Citi&#x27;s Smith Barney to form Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Morgan Stanley owned 51% of the entity, and Citi held 49%. On May 31, 2012, Morgan Stanley exercised its option to purchase an additional 14% of the joint venture from Citi. In June 2013, Morgan Stanley stated it had secured all regulatory approvals to buy Citigroup&#x27;s remaining 35% stake in Smith Barney and would proceed to finalize the deal.

In February 2019, the company announced the acquisition of Solium Capital, a manager of employee stock plans, for $900 million (~$ in ).

Morgan Stanley&#x27;s asset management activities were principally conducted under the Morgan Stanley and Van Kampen brands until 2009.

On October 19, 2009, Morgan Stanley announced that it would sell Van Kampen to Invesco for $1.5 billion (~$ in ), but would retain the Morgan Stanley brand.

==Controversy==

=== 2000s ===

In 2003, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $125 million to settle its portion of a $1.4 billion settlement of a suit brought by Eliot Spitzer, the Attorney General of New York, the National Association of Securities Dealers (now the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)), the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and a number of state securities regulators, relating to intentionally misleading research motivated by a desire to win investment banking business with the companies covered.

On May 16, 2005, a Florida jury found that Morgan Stanley failed to give adequate information to Ronald Perelman about Sunbeam thereby defrauding him and causing damages to him of $604 million (~$ in ). In addition, punitive damages were added for total damages of $1.450 billion. This verdict was directed by the judge as a sanction against Morgan Stanley after the firm&#x27;s attorneys infuriated the court by failing and refusing to produce documents, and falsely telling the court that certain documents did not exist. The ruling was overturned on March 21, 2007, and Morgan Stanley was no longer required to pay the $1.57 billion (~$ in ) verdict.

Morgan Stanley settled a class-action lawsuit on March 2, 2006. It had been filed in California by both current and former Morgan Stanley employees for unfair labor practices instituted to those in the financial advisor training program. Employees of the program had claimed the firm expected trainees to clock overtime hours without additional pay and handle various administrative expenses as a result of their expected duties. A $42.5 million settlement was reached and Morgan Stanley admitted no fault.

In May the firm agreed to pay a $15 million fine. The Securities and Exchange Commission accused the firm of deleting emails and failing to cooperate with SEC investigators.

FINRA announced a $12.5 million (~$ in ) settlement with Morgan Stanley on September 27, 2007. This resolved charges that the firm&#x27;s former affiliate, Morgan Stanley DW, Inc. (MSDW), failed on numerous occasions to provide emails to claimants in arbitration proceedings as well as to regulators. The company had claimed that the destruction of the firm&#x27;s email servers in the September 11 attacks in 2001, terrorist attacks on New York&#x27;s World Trade Center resulted in the loss of all emails before that date. In fact, the firm had millions of earlier emails that had been retrieved from backup copies stored in another location that was not destroyed in the attacks. Customers who had lost their arbitration cases against Morgan Stanley DW Inc. because of their inability to obtain these emails to demonstrate Morgan Stanley&#x27;s misconduct received a token amount of money as a result of the settlement.

<text>Michael VII Doukas or Ducas (), nicknamed Parapinakes (, , a reference to the devaluation of the Byzantine currency under his rule), was the senior Byzantine emperor from 1071 to 1078. He was known as incompetent as an emperor and reliant on court officials, especially of his finance minister Nikephoritzes, who increased taxation and luxury spending while not properly financing their army (which later mutinied). Under his reign, Bari was lost and his empire faced open revolt in the Balkans. Along with the advancing Seljuk Turks in the eastern front, Michael also had to contend with his mercenaries openly turning against the empire. Michael stepped down as emperor in 1078 and later retired to a monastery.

== Life ==

Michael VII was born 1050 in Constantinople, the eldest son of Constantine X Doukas and Eudokia Makrembolitissa. He was probably associated with the throne by the end of 1060, together with or shortly before his newly born brother Konstantios Doukas. When Constantine X died on 23 May 1067, Michael VII was already 17 years old and should have been able to rule by himself. He exhibited little interest in politics, however, and his mother Eudokia and uncle John Doukas governed the empire as effective regents.

On 1 January 1068, Eudokia married the general Romanos IV Diogenes, who now became senior co-emperor alongside Michael VII, Konstantios, and another brother, Andronikos. When Romanos IV was defeated and captured by Alp Arslan of the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in August 1071, Michael VII remained in the background, while the initiative to take power was taken by his uncle John Doukas and his tutor Michael Psellos. Michael VII was proclaimed emperor on 1 October 1071, although Eudokia ruled as regent for a month before being dispatched to a monastery.

Although still advised by Michael Psellos and John Doukas, Michael VII became increasingly reliant on his finance minister Nikephoritzes. The emperor&#x27;s chief interests, shaped by Psellos, were in academic pursuits, and he allowed Nikephoritzes to increase both taxation and luxury spending without properly financing the army. As an emperor he was incompetent, often surrounded by sycophantic court officials. In dire straits, imperial officials resorted to property confiscations and even expropriated some of the wealth of the church. The underpaid army tended to mutiny, and the Byzantines lost Bari, their last possession in Italy, to the Normans of Robert Guiscard in 1071. Simultaneously, they faced a serious revolt under Georgi Voyteh in the Balkans, where they faced an attempt at the restoration of the Bulgarian state. Although this revolt was suppressed by the general Nikephoros Bryennios, the Byzantine Empire was unable to recover its losses in Asia Minor.

After Manzikert, the Byzantine government sent a new army to contain the Seljuk Turks under Isaac Komnenos, a brother of the future emperor Alexios I Komnenos, but this army was defeated and its commander captured in 1073. The problem was made worse by the desertion of the Byzantines&#x27; western mercenaries under Roussel de Bailleul who were setting up an independent principiality in the region of Galatia and Lycaonia. They became the object of the next military expedition in the area, led by Michael&#x27;s uncle, &quot;caesar&quot; John Doukas. This campaign also ended in failure, and John was likewise captured by the enemy. The victorious Roussel now forced John Doukas to stand as pretender to the throne and sacked Chrysopolis, just opposite Constantinople. A new army under Alexios Komnenos (the future emperor), reinforced by Seljuk troops sent by Malik Shah I, finally defeated the mercenaries and captured John Doukas in 1074.

These misfortunes caused widespread dissatisfaction, exacerbated by the devaluation of the currency, which gave the emperor his nickname &quot;Parapinakēs.&quot; In 1078 two generals, Nikephoros Bryennios and Nikephoros Botaneiates, simultaneously revolted in the Balkans and Anatolia, respectively. Botaneiates gained the support of the Seljuk Turks, and he reached Constantinople first. Michael VII resigned the throne with hardly a struggle on 24 or 31 March 1078 and retired into the Monastery of Stoudios. He later became metropolitan of Ephesus and died in Constantinople in c. 1090.

Before his resignation from the throne, Michael VII may have sent an embassy to Song China, following a series of Byzantine embassies to the earlier Tang Empire of China. From the &quot;Wenxian Tongkao&quot;, written by Chinese historian Ma Duanlin (1245–1322), and the 14th century work the &quot;History of Song,&quot; it is known that the ruler &quot;Mie-li-yi-ling-kai-sa&quot; (滅力伊靈改撒) of &quot;Fu-lin&quot; (i.e. Byzantium) sent an embassy to the Song dynasty which arrived on November 1081, during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067–1085). The &quot;History of Song&quot; mentions how the Byzantine diplomat and official named &quot;Ni-si-tu-ling-si-meng-p&#x27;an&quot; offered saddled horses, sword-blades, and real pearls as tributary gifts to the Song court.

==Usurpers==
Various usurpers attempted to overthrow Michael VII or rule parts of the empire. These included:

* Nestor – A former slave of Constantine X, Nestor had been promoted to become the dux of Paradounavon, a region bordering the Danube. Having had much of his property and wealth confiscated by the minister Nikephoritzes, he rebelled in around 1076, placing himself at the head of the garrisons under his command, which were already in a state of mutiny due to an arrears in their pay. The troops were eager to plunder the Bulgarians, and Nestor obtained the assistance of one of the chiefs of the Pechenegs before marching onto Constantinople. The rebels demanded the dismissal of Nikephoritzes, but discovering that he didn&#x27;t have the numbers to attack the capital, Nestor&#x27;s troops separated into smaller parties and proceeded to plunder Thrace. Defeated by Alexios Komnenos in 1078, Nestor remained with the Pechenegs, and retreated with them back to Paradunavum.
* Philaretos Brachamios
* John Doukas (the Caesar), Michael&#x27;s uncle
* Nikephoros Bryennios
* Nikephoros Botaneiates

==Family==
Michael VII Doukas married Maria of Alania, daughter of King Bagrat IV of Georgia. By her he had at least one son, Constantine Doukas, co-emperor from c. 1075 to 1078 and from 1081 to 1087/8. He died c. 1095.

<doc id="74387" wikidata="Q162518" url="?curid=74387" title="How the West Was Won (film)">
<text>How the West Was Won is a 1962 American epic Western film directed by Henry Hathaway (who directed three out of the five chapters), John Ford and George Marshall, produced by Bernard Smith, written by James R. Webb, and narrated by Spencer Tracy. The film centers on a family and their descendents over the span of decades as they explore and settle the American frontier of the United States. 

Originally filmed in true three-lens Cinerama with the according three-panel panorama projected onto an enormous curved screen, the film features an ensemble cast formed by many cinema icons and newcomers, including (in alphabetical order) Carroll Baker, Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda, Carolyn Jones, Karl Malden, Gregory Peck, George Peppard, Robert Preston, Debbie Reynolds, James Stewart, Eli Wallach, John Wayne and Richard Widmark. The supporting cast features Brigid Bazlen, Walter Brennan, David Brian, Andy Devine, Raymond Massey, Agnes Moorehead, Henry (Harry) Morgan, Thelma Ritter, Mickey Shaughnessy and Russ Tamblyn.

&quot;How the West Was Won&quot; is widely considered one of Hollywood&#x27;s greatest epics. The film received widespread critical acclaim and was a box office success, grossing $50 million on a budget of $15 million. At the 36th Academy Awards it earned eight nominations, including Best Picture, and won three, for Best Story and Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, Best Sound and Best Film Editing. In 1997 it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==

=== The Rivers (1839) ===
Zebulon Prescott and his family set out west for the frontier on the Erie Canal. They are pulled through the first section on a barge and then build rafts to continue on the Ohio River. Along the journey, they meet mountain man Linus Rawlings, who is traveling to Pittsburgh to trade his furs. Rawlings and Zebulon&#x27;s eldest daughter, Eve, are attracted to each other, but he is not ready to settle down.

Rawlings stops at an isolated trading post, which is actually a front run by a clan of river pirates. Linus is led into a cave, stabbed in the back, and then pushed down a hole. The pirates steal his furs and sink his canoe. Wounded, Linus follows them. When they are about to rob the Prescott party, Linus intervenes and helps the Prescotts kill all of the pirates.

The Prescotts continue down the river. When the lead raft is caught in rapids, Zebulon and his wife Rebecca drown; Linus arrives to help bury them. Deciding he cannot live without Eve, he asks to marry her and take her to Pittsburgh, but she insists on homesteading at the spot where her parents died.

=== The Plains (1851) ===

Eve&#x27;s sister Lilith chooses to go back east, dreaming of becoming rich, and years later becomes a singer and dancer in St. Louis. While performing at a music hall, she attracts the attention of professional gambler Cleve Van Valen, who learns that she has just inherited a California gold mine. 

On a wagon train heading west, Lilith partners with an elderly woman named Agatha; Cleve joins them to avoid his debts and to swindle Lilith of her gold. Wagonmaster Roger Morgan and Cleve court her along the way, but she rejects them both. Surviving an arduous trek and an attack by the Cheyenne together, Lilith falls for Cleve. The pair eventually arrive at the mine, but discover that it is worthless. Cleve leaves; Lilith returns to work in a camp town&#x27;s dance hall, heartbroken. Morgan finds her and again proposes marriage, to no avail.

Later, Lilith performs on a Sacramento riverboat. By chance, Cleve is a passenger. The pair happily reunite, and Cleve proposes to her, telling her of the business opportunities waiting in San Francisco. She accepts his proposal.

=== The Civil War (1861–1865) ===
Linus Rawlings has joined the Union army as a captain in the American Civil War. Despite Eve&#x27;s wishes, their son Zeb enlists as well, seeking adventure and an escape from farming. The bloody Battle of Shiloh shows Zeb the cruel realities of war, and his father dies there. 

Zeb encounters a disillusioned Confederate soldier who suggests deserting. By chance, they eavesdrop on Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. The Confederate realizes he has the opportunity to shoot them, leaving Zeb no choice but to kill him. Zeb continues to serve for the rest of the war.

When the war ends, Zeb returns home as a lieutenant and learns his mother died, having lost the will to live after losing Linus. Zeb renounces his share of the family farm to his brother and leaves, deciding to stay in the army.

=== The Railroad (1868) ===

In the late 1860s, two competing railroad lines, the Central Pacific Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad, open up new territories that attract American and European settlers. 

Zeb serves in the U.S. Cavalry, trying to maintain peace with the Native Americans with the help of buffalo hunter Jethro Stuart, an old friend of Linus&#x27;s. When railroad man Mike King violates a treaty by building on Native American territory, the Arapahos retaliate by stampeding buffalo through his camp, killing many. 

Disgusted by Mike&#x27;s unchecked greed and callousness, Zeb resigns from the army, and then visits Jethro at his mountain cabin before moving on.

=== The Outlaws (1889) ===

In San Francisco, the widowed Lilith auctions off her possessions to pay off debts. Satisfied by the prosperous life she shared with Cleve, she travels to Arizona, inviting Zeb and his family to oversee a cattle ranch, her last remaining asset.

Zeb (now a marshal), his wife Julie, and their children meet Lilith at Gold City&#x27;s train station. There, Zeb runs into outlaw Charlie Gant. Zeb had previously killed Gant&#x27;s brother in a gunfight. When Gant makes threats against Zeb and his family, Zeb turns to his friend, local marshal Lou Ramsey. However, Gant is not wanted for anything in that territory, so Ramsey can do nothing.

Deciding he must act, Zeb suspects Gant plans to rob a train&#x27;s gold shipment, and prepares an ambush with Ramsey&#x27;s reluctant help. Gant and his gang are killed in the shootout and resulting train wreck. Lilith and the Rawlings family travel by wagon to their new home.

The film marked then 66-year-old Raymond Massey&#x27;s last appearance as Abraham Lincoln, a role that he previously played on stage (&quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot; and the stage adaptation of &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;), on screen (&quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot;) and on television (&quot;The Day Lincoln Was Shot&quot;, and two more productions of &quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot;).

== Production ==
=== Development ===
MGM had enjoyed a great success with the big screen remake of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959) and initiated a number of spectacles, including remakes of &quot;Cimarron&quot;, &quot;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;.

In 1960, MGM struck a deal to produce four films in the Cinerama process, and Bing Crosby approached the studio with a proposition. He was developing a television spectacular called &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; based on photographs of the Old West in &quot;Life&quot;, with profits earmarked for St. John&#x27;s Hospital, along with an album inspired by the same article recorded with Rosemary Clooney. MGM purchased the film rights from Crosby.

MGM announced the project in June 1960, originally titled &quot;The Great Western Story&quot;. The plan was to film a story of six segments featuring 12 stars, with a cohesive overall storyline. Among the historical figures to be featured were Buffalo Bill, the James brothers and Billy the Kid. St. John&#x27;s Hospital president Irene Dunne and others persuaded the film&#x27;s stars to accept less than their usual fees. However, the hospital later sued for a share of the film&#x27;s profits.

Bernard Smith was assigned as producer, and he hired James Webb to write the script. George Peppard was announced as the lead in October 1960, and Irene Dunne and Bing Crosby were originally announced as stars. Laurence Harvey and John Wayne were also slated to appear in one sequence together. &quot;Filmink&quot; commented Peppard &quot;carries the last three-fifths&quot; of the film, adding &quot;if anyone is the leading man of that movie, it’s him.&quot;

By April 1961, Wayne and Spencer Tracy had confirmed their plans to play Generals Sherman and Grant for a segment directed by John Ford, and James Stewart had been signed as well. Other roles would go to Gregory Peck, Debbie Reynolds, Russ Tamblyn and Carroll Baker, while Henry Hathaway and George Marshall would also direct from a script by James Webb. Crosby was scheduled to provide narration. Jim Hutton was intended to appear in the Civil War segment. Eventually, Harry Morgan appeared as Grant when Tracy was unavailable.

Ultimately, the film contained five sections: the 1830s westward migration, the 1849 California gold rush, the Civil War, the construction of the transcontinental railroad, and the &quot;taming&quot; of the Wild West, with one family&#x27;s story over three generations providing the bridge between each time period. The budget was set to at least $8 million. John Ford directed the Civil War segment, George Marshall the railroad segment and Henry Hathaway the rest. &quot;We wanted three old pros, no young geniuses,&quot; said Smith.

=== Cinerama ===
&quot;How the West Was Won&quot; was one of only two dramatic feature films (along with &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot;) produced with the three-strip Cinerama process. Although the picture quality when projected onto curved screens in theaters is stunning, attempts to convert the film to a smaller screen suffer. When the film is projected in letterbox format, the actors&#x27; faces are nearly indistinguishable in long shots.

=== Shooting ===
Filming started in May 1961 by John Ford in Paducah, Kentucky. Producer Bernard Smith said, &quot;It is essential for our purposes that virtually the whole movie be shot outdoors. Throughout the movie, one of the basic themes is to show little people against a vast country – huge deserts, endless plains, towering mountains, broad rivers. We want to capture the spirit of adventure, the restless spirit that led these men and women across the country in [the] face of many difficulties and dangers.&quot;

After Ford finished his segment, Hathaway took over on location. Hathaway called Ford&#x27;s segment &quot;a little stagey&quot;.

Parts of the film were shot in Monument Valley, Utah and in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California.

Ford complained about having to dress such huge sets, as Cinerama photographed a much wider view than did the standard single-camera process to which Hollywood directors were accustomed. Director Henry Hathaway was quoted as saying, &quot;That Goddamned Cinerama; do you know a waist shot is as close as you can get with that thing?&quot;

A more difficult problem was that filming required that the actors be artificially positioned out of dramatic and emotional frame and out of synchronization with one another. Only when the three-print Cinerama process was projected upon a Cinerama screen did the positions and emotions of the actors synchronize, such as normal eye contact or emotional harmony between actors in a dramatic sequence. Because of the nature of Cinerama, if the film were shown in flat-screen projection, it would appear as if the actors made no eye contact. One brief scene of Mexican soldiers was sourced by John Wayne from his 1960 version of &quot;The Alamo&quot;.

Stuntman Bob Morgan, husband of Yvonne De Carlo, was seriously injured and lost a leg during a break in filming a gunfight on a moving train while filming the Outlaws portion. Chains holding logs on a flatbed car broke, crushing Morgan as he crouched beside them.

In a scene in which George Peppard&#x27;s character reminisces about his late father, Peppard improvises with an imitation of James Stewart&#x27;s voice. Ford initially objected, but Peppard felt that it was important in such a long, sprawling film to remind the audience which character his father was supposed to be.

Hathaway later said that making the film was &quot;goddam trouble. They had an idiot for a producer and Sol Siegel was drunk most of the time. We spent so much money on the picture they almost decided not to do the last part. We had a meeting, and I said, &#x27;You can&#x27;t quit. You&#x27;ve got to show how the West was won. The West was won when the law took over&#x27;.&quot;

=== Post-production ===
Filming was completed in January 1962. After the film was shot, MGM ordered a new ending that resolved the family story, which caused shooting to continue for another month and included George Peppard and Debbie Reynolds. The budget eventually reached $12 million.

For &quot;The Civil War&quot; segment, footage from MGM&#x27;s 1957 film &quot;Raintree County&quot; of the Civil War Battle of Chickamauga were used for combat scenes during the day, as the scenes with Peppard, Tamblyn, Wayne, and Morgan were all at night. A brief shot of a steamboat going down a river (seen during the end of the Plains Segment) is also used from &quot;Raintree County&quot;.

For &quot;The Railroad&quot; segment, a subplot was cut featuring Hope Lange as Stuart&#x27;s daughter, Julie, who becomes involved in a love triangle with Zeb and King; she ultimately marries and abandons Zeb.

The film later inspired a television series of the same name.

== Music ==
The film&#x27;s music was composed and conducted by Alfred Newman. The soundtrack album was originally released by MGM Records. Dimitri Tiomkin, known for his Western film scores, was the first composer approached, but he became unavailable following eye surgery and Newman was hired as a replacement.

The score is widely considered as among Newman&#x27;s best, and it appears on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores list. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score, losing to the score for &quot;Tom Jones&quot;.

Debbie Reynolds sings three songs in the film: &quot;Raise a Ruckus Tonight&quot; starting a party around the camp fire, &quot;What Was Your Name in the States?&quot; and &quot;A Home in the Meadow&quot; to the tune of &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, with lyrics by Sammy Cahn. Her rendition is heard by Cleve (Gregory Peck), who is so moved that he proposes marriage. This scene ends the Plains segment.

== Reception ==
=== Premiere ===
Surprisingly for such an American film, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; had its world premiere in the United Kingdom at London&#x27;s Casino Cinerama Theatre on November 1, 1962. It had a $450,000 advance. The film ran at the Casino for 123 weeks, ending in April 1965.

===Critical reception===
Harold Myers of &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;magnificent and exciting spectacle&quot; and in relation to the Cinerama process noted that there had been &quot;a vast improvement in the process. The print joins are barely noticeable, and the wobble, which beset earlier productions, has been eliminated.&quot; Reviews from London were favorable but with reservations over the storyline. Alexander Walker of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; called it &quot;a super-epic which shucks away your sophistication. If ever I heard the sound of success it is this.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; said &quot;it has a kind of surge and splendour and extravagance not to be despised.&quot;

=== Box-office performance ===
&quot;How the West Was Won&quot; was a massive commercial success. Produced on a large budget of $15 million, it grossed $46,500,000 at the North American box office, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1963. The film has grossed over $50 million worldwide.

== Restoration ==

In 2000, Warner Bros. assigned Crest Digital the task of restoring the original Cinerama negative for &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;. As part of the process, Crest Digital built its own authentic Cinerama screening room. Hewlett-Packard has led efforts to combine the three image portions to make the Cinerama image look more acceptable on a flat screen. This has finally been accomplished on the latest DVD and Blu-ray disc release. Previously, the lines where the three Cinerama panels join were glaringly visible, but this has been largely corrected on the Warner Bros. DVD and Blu-ray releases. However, the joints remain visible in places, especially against bright backgrounds.

The restoration also corrects some of the geometric distortions inherent in the process. For instance, in the final shot, the Golden Gate Bridge appears to curve in perspective as the camera flies underneath it whereas in the Cinerama version, it breaks into three straight sections at different angles.

The Blu-ray disc also contains a &quot;SmileBox&quot; version simulating the curved-screen effect.

Though the aspect ratio of Cinerama is 2.59:1, Warner&#x27;s new releases of the film offer an aspect ratio of 2.89:1, incorporating much information on both sides that was not intended to be seen when projected. The Blu-ray-exclusive SmileBox alternative contains the intended cropping intact.

In 2006, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Imaging performed digital restoration on &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;. The film was restored frame by frame at Prasad Corporation to remove dirt, tears, scratches and other damage, restoring the film&#x27;s original appearance. The restored version has been shown on television since October 2008 on the Encore Westerns channel.

== Adaptations ==
* Gold Key Comics: &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (July 1963)
* The novelization was written in 1962 by well-known Western author Louis L&#x27;Amour. According to his son Beau, his father had frequent clashes with the studio, both over elements of inauthenticity and inaccuracy in the film, and with the indecisiveness of the studio regarding the segments to be made, and thus, those that L&#x27;Amour would need to include in the novelization.

<text>James Neville Mason (; 15 May 190927 July 1984) was an English actor. He achieved considerable success in British cinema before becoming a star in Hollywood. He was nominated for three Academy Awards, three Golden Globes (winning once) and two BAFTA Awards throughout his career.

Mason began his career as a stage actor on the West End, before transitioning into leading man roles in films during the early 1940s. He was the top box-office attraction in the UK in 1944 and 1945; his British films included &quot;The Seventh Veil&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1945). He starred in &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; (1947), the first recipient of the BAFTA Award for Best British Film.

Moving to the United States in the following decade, Mason starred in such films as George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1954) - earning a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962), Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978) and Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1982).

He also starred in a number of successful British and American films from the 1950s to the early 1980s, including: &quot;The Desert Fox&quot; (1951), &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953), &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot; (1956), &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1959), &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; (1966), &quot;Spring and Port Wine&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1978). Following his death in 1984, his ashes were interred near the tomb of his close friend, fellow English actor Sir Charlie Chaplin.

==Early life, family and education==
Mason was born on 15 May 1909 in Huddersfield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the youngest of three sons of John Mason and Mabel Hattersley, daughter of Joseph Shaw Gaunt. A wealthy wool merchant like his father, John Mason travelled often on business, mainly in France and Belgium. Mabel—who was &quot;uncommonly well-educated&quot; and had lived in London to study and begin work as an artist before returning to Yorkshire to care for her father—was &quot;attentive and loving&quot; in raising her sons. The Masons lived in a house in its own grounds on Croft House Lane in Marsh. (It was replaced in the mid-1970s by flats called Arncliffe Court.) A small residential development opposite where the house once stood is now called James Mason Court.

Mason was educated at Marlborough College and took a first in architecture at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he became involved in stock theatre companies in his spare time. He had no formal acting training, and initially embarked upon it for fun.

==Career==
=== 1931–1939: Early roles ===
After Cambridge, Mason made his stage debut in Aldershot in &quot;The Rascal&quot; in 1931. He joined the Old Vic theatre in London under the guidance of Tyrone Guthrie. While there he appeared in productions of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, &quot;Love for Love&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Featuring in many of these were Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. In the mid-1930s he also appeared at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, notably in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; with Betty Chancellor. In 1933, Alexander Korda gave Mason a small role in &quot;The Private Life of Don Juan&quot; but sacked him three days into shooting.

From 1935 to 1938, Mason starred in many British quota quickies, starting with his first film &quot;Late Extra&quot; (1935), in which he played the lead. Albert Parker directed. Mason appeared in &quot;Twice Branded&quot; (1936); &quot;Troubled Waters&quot; (1936), also directed by Parker; &quot;Prison Breaker&quot; (1936); &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot; (1936), for Parker&#x27;s &quot;The Secret of Stamboul&quot; (1936), and &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; (1936), an &quot;A&quot; movie. Mason had a key support role in Korda&#x27;s &quot;Fire Over England&quot; (1937) with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. He was in another &quot;A&quot;, &quot;The High Command&quot; (1937) directed by Thorold Dickinson, then went back to quickies, starring in &quot;Catch As Catch Can&quot; (1937), directed by Roy Kellino. Korda cast him as the villain in &quot;The Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1937)

Mason began appearing in some televised productions of plays, made in the very early days of television: &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1938), &quot;The Moon in the Yellow River&quot; (1938), &quot;Bees on the Boat-Deck&quot; (1939), &quot;Square Pegs&quot; (1939), &quot;L&#x27;Avare&quot; (1939), and &quot;The Circle&quot; (1939). He returned to features with &quot;I Met a Murderer&quot; (1939) based on a story by Mason and Pamela Kellino, who also starred with Mason and whom he would marry. Her husband Roy Kellino directed.
===1941–1957: Leading man status===
Second World War

Mason registered as a conscientious objector during World War II (causing his family to break with him for many years), but his tribunal did not exempt him on the requirement for non-combatant military service, which he also refused. He appealed against that aspect of the tribunal&#x27;s decision, but it became irrelevant once he was included in a general exemption for film work. In 1941–42 he returned to the stage to appear in &quot;Jupiter Laughs&quot; by A. J. Cronin. He established himself as a leading man in Britain in a series of films: &quot;The Patient Vanishes&quot; (1941); &quot;Hatter&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1941) with Robert Newton and Deborah Kerr; &quot;The Night Has Eyes&quot; (1941); &quot;Alibi&quot; (1942) with Margaret Lockwood; &quot;Secret Mission&quot; (1942); &quot;Thunder Rock&quot; (1942) with Michael Redgrave; and &quot;The Bells Go Down&quot; (1943) with Tommy Trinder.

Mason became hugely popular for his brooding anti-heroes, and occasional outright villains, in the Gainsborough series of melodramas of the 1940s, starting with &quot;The Man in Grey&quot; (1943). The film was a huge hit and made him and co-stars Lockwood, Stewart Granger and Phyllis Calvert top-level stars. Mason starred in two wartime dramas, &quot;They Met in the Dark&quot; (1943) and &quot;Candlelight in Algeria&quot; (1944), then returned to Gainsborough melodrama with &quot;Fanny By Gaslight&quot; (1944) with Granger and Calvert; it was another big hit. He starred in &quot;Hotel Reserve&quot; (1944), a thriller, then did a ghost story for Gainsborough with Lockwood, &quot;A Place of One&#x27;s Own&quot; (1945). Far more popular was a melodrama, &quot;They Were Sisters&quot; (1945).

Sydney Box cast Mason in a psychodrama about musicians, &quot;The Seventh Veil&quot; (1945), as the tyrannical guardian of pianist Ann Todd. It was a huge success in Britain and the US and demand for Mason was at a fever pitch. Exhibitors voted him the most popular star in Britain in each year between 1944 and 1947. They also declared him the most popular international star in 1946; he dropped to second place the following year. He was the most popular male star in Canada in 1948.

Mason had a relatively minor role in &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1945) with Lockwood, a big hit. He then received his best reviews to date playing a mortally wounded IRA bank robber on the run in Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; (1947). He turned producer with Sydney Box on &quot;The Upturned Glass&quot; (1947), which starred Mason with a script by Mason&#x27;s wife. It was not particularly successful. Neither was &quot;Bathsheba,&quot; a play the Masons did on Broadway. Mason went to Hollywood for his first film, &quot;Caught&quot; (1949), directed by Max Ophüls, then played Gustave Flaubert in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1949). He did another with Ophüls, &quot;The Reckless Moment&quot; (1949), and followed it with &quot;East Side, West Side&quot; (1949) with Barbara Stanwyck at MGM and &quot;One Way Street&quot; (1950) at Universal. He made &quot;Pandora and the Flying Dutchman&quot; (1951) with Ava Gardner. None of these films were particularly successful.
Films at 20th Century Fox

Mason&#x27;s Hollywood career was revived when he was cast as General Rommel in &quot;The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel&quot; (1951), directed by Henry Hathaway. To do the film he agreed to sign a contract with 20th Century Fox for seven years at one film a year. Mason did a film at Republic Pictures written by his wife and directed by Roy Kellino, &quot;Lady Possessed&quot; (1951). At Fox, he played a spy in &quot;5 Fingers&quot; (1951), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. MGM hired him to play Rupert of Hentzau in &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1952) opposite Granger. He was in the lower budgeted &quot;Face to Face&quot; (1952) then went to Paramount to play a villainous sea captain opposite Alan Ladd in &quot;Botany Bay&quot; (1953).

Mason was one of many stars in MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot; (1953). At Fox, he reprised his role as Rommel in &quot;The Desert Rats&quot; (1953), then he was reunited with Mankiewicz at MGM, playing Brutus in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953), opposite Marlon Brando. The film was very successful. Mason worked with Carol Reed in &quot;The Man Between&quot; (1953), then Fox used him as a villain again in &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; (1954). Mason did another film with a screenplay by his wife and directed by Roy Kellino, &quot;Charade&quot; (1954).

Warner Bros., hired him to play Judy Garland&#x27;s leading man in the George Cukor directed musical drama film &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1954). He took the role after Cary Grant turned the role down. Mason won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Jack Moffitt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised the film writing, &quot;&quot;A Star Is Born&quot; is the perfect blend of drama and musical — of cinematic art and popular entertainment.&quot;

He went over to Disney to play Captain Nemo in &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), a huge hit which also starred Kirk Douglas. During 1954 and 1955, Mason was the host of some episodes of &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; on CBS television. Mason appeared with Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in &quot;Forever, Darling&quot; (1956) then starred in and produced a film at Fox, &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot; (1956), directed by Nicholas Ray. Mason played a small-town school teacher driven insane by the effects of cortisone. He did another for Fox, the hugely popular melodrama, &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; (1957).

===1958–1970: Established actor===

Mason began appearing regularly on television in shows such as &quot;Panic!&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Goodyear Theatre&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (several episodes including &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Raid&quot;). He starred in two thrillers for Andrew L. Stone, &quot;Cry Terror!&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Decks Ran Red&quot; (1958) then played a suave master spy hunting down Cary Grant with romantic assistance from Eva Marie Saint in &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), directed by Alfred Hitchcock.

At Fox he had a huge hit returning to Jules Verne science fantasy as the determined Scottish scientist and explorer in &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; (1959), taking over a role meant for Clifton Webb. He did a comedy &quot;A Touch of Larceny&quot; (1960) and was Sir Edward Carson in &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot; (1960). He continued to appear on TV shows like &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, &quot;Golden Showcase&quot;, &quot;Theatre &#x27;62&quot; and &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;.

He did &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot; (1961), then played Dolores&#x27; sexually obsessive stepfather Humbert Humbert in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s version of &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962). He starred in &quot;Tiara Tahiti&quot; (1962), then &quot;Hero&#x27;s Island&quot; (1962), which he also produced. He was in &quot;Torpedo Bay&quot; (1963).

In 1963 Mason settled in Switzerland, and embarked on a transatlantic career. He began to drift into support roles, or second leads: the epic &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1964); &quot;The Pumpkin Eater&quot; (1964), with Anne Bancroft; a river pirate who betrays Peter O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s character in &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1965); a Chinese noble in &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (1965); &quot;The Uninhibited&quot; (1965); a guest role on &quot;Dr Kildare&quot;; James Leamington in the Swinging London-set &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; (1966), a role that earned him a second Academy Award nomination, this one for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

In 1967, Mason narrated the documentary &quot;The London Nobody Knows&quot;. An ardent cinephile on top of his career interests, Mason narrated two British documentary series supervised by Kevin Brownlow: &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1980), on the silent cinema and &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot; (1983), devoted to out-take material from the films of Sir Charlie Chaplin. Mason had been a long-time neighbour and friend of the actor and director Charlie Chaplin. In the late 1970s, Mason became a mentor to up-and-coming actor Sam Neill.

He was in several episodes of &quot;ITV Play of the Week&quot; and he had the lead in &quot;The Deadly Affair&quot; (1967) for Sidney Lumet (playing a character based on George Smiley though it was renamed); and &quot;Stranger in the House&quot; (1968). He provided a supporting role in &quot;Duffy&quot; (1968), &quot;The Blue Max (1966)&quot; and &quot;Mayerling&quot; (1968) but was top billed in &quot;The Sea Gull&quot; (1968) for Sidney Lumet and starred as Bradley Morahan in &quot;Age of Consent&quot; (1969) for Michael Powell, a film which Mason also produced. The movie featured Helen Mirren&#x27;s first major film role, and was Powell&#x27;s last major film. He also had the star role in &quot;Spring and Port Wine&quot; (1970).

===1970–1985: Later roles===

Mason supported Charles Bronson in &quot;Cold Sweat&quot; (1970) and Lee Van Cleef in &quot;Bad Man&#x27;s River&quot; (1971). He was a support in &quot;Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!&quot; (1971) and top billed in &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; (1972) for Lumet, replacing Marlon Brando. He was one of many stars in &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; (1973) and played the evil Doctor Polidori in &quot;&quot; (1973). He had support roles in &quot;The MacKintosh Man&quot; (1973), &quot;11 Harrowhouse&quot; (1974), &quot;The Marseille Contract&quot; (1974), and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1974) and was top billed in &quot;Mandingo&quot; (1975).

Mason&#x27;s later 70s performances included &quot;Kidnap Syndicate&quot; (1975), &quot;The Left Hand of the Law&quot; (1975), &quot;Autobiography of a Princess&quot; (1975), &quot;Inside Out&quot; (1975), &quot;The Flower in His Mouth&quot; (1975), &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976), &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; (1977), &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; (1977), &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977), &quot;The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go&quot; (1978), &quot;The Water Babies&quot; (1978), &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978), &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1978), &quot;Murder by Decree&quot; (1979) (as Dr. Watson), &quot;The Passage&quot; (1979), &quot;Bloodline&quot; (1979) and as the vampire&#x27;s servant, Richard Straker, in &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; (1979).

Mason was in &quot;North Sea Hijack&quot; (1980), supporting Roger Moore, &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; (1982), &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1982), and &quot;A Dangerous Summer&quot; (1982). One of his last roles, that of the corrupt lawyer Ed Concannon in &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1982), opposite Paul Newman, earned him his third and final Oscar nomination, for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. He had parts in &quot;Yellowbeard&quot; (1983), &quot;Alexandre&quot; (1983), and &quot;George Washington&quot; (1984).

Having completed playing the lead role in &quot;Dr. Fischer of Geneva&quot; (1985), adapted from Graham Greene&#x27;s eponymous novella for the BBC, he stepped into the role in &quot;The Shooting Party&quot; originally meant for Paul Scofield, who was unable to continue after being seriously injured in an accident on the first day of shooting. This was to be Mason&#x27;s final screen performance in a feature film. He did appear on television in &quot;A.D.&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Assisi Underground&quot; (1985).

==Recordings==
James Mason recorded an album for York Records. The 13-track spoken word album, &quot;James Mason Reads from the Bible&quot; was issued on York BYK 703 in 1971.

==Personal life==
Mason was a devoted lover of animals, particularly cats. He and his wife, Pamela Mason, co-authored the book &quot;The Cats in Our Lives&quot;, which was published in 1949. James wrote most of the book and also illustrated it. In &quot;The Cats in Our Lives&quot;, he recounted humorous and sometimes touching tales of the cats (as well as a few dogs) he had known and loved.

In 1952, Mason purchased a house previously owned by Buster Keaton. There he discovered reels of nitrate film of some of Keaton&#x27;s work that was considered lost, including &quot;The Boat&quot; (1921). He arranged to have the decomposing films transferred to safety stock, saving them from oblivion.

In his youth, Mason was a keen fan of his local Rugby League team, Huddersfield. In later years he also followed the fortunes of Huddersfield Town.

Mason was married twice:
* From 1941 to 1964 to British actress Pamela Mason (née Ostrer) (1916–1996). They had one daughter, Portland Mason Schuyler (1948–2004), and one son, Morgan (who is married to Belinda Carlisle, the lead singer of the Go-Go&#x27;s). Pamela Mason filed suit for divorce in 1962 for lack of support, claiming adultery on his part with three Jane Does. According to their son Morgan and other sources, Pamela herself had had numerous affairs, but due to her attorney Marvin Mitchelson&#x27;s skill, she won a monetary settlement of at least $1 million ($9.275 million today) when the marriage was finally dissolved in 1964; it was reported as &quot;America&#x27;s first million-dollar divorce&quot;. As a result of this success, Mitchelson became a sought-after celebrity divorce attorney.
* Australian actress Clarissa Kaye (1971 – his death). Tobe Hooper&#x27;s DVD commentary for &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; reveals that Mason regularly included contractual clauses in his later work guaranteeing Kaye bit parts in his films.

Mason&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Before I Forget&quot;, was published in 1981.

==Death==
Mason survived a severe heart attack in 1959. He died as result of another heart attack on 27 July 1984 in Lausanne, Switzerland, and was cremated. Mason left his entire estate to his second wife, Clarissa Kaye, but his will was challenged by his two children. The lawsuit had not been settled when she died on 21 July 1994 from cancer. Clarissa Kaye Mason left her holdings to the religious guru Sathya Sai Baba, including the actor&#x27;s ashes, which she had retained in their shared home. Mason&#x27;s children sued Sai Baba and subsequently had Mason&#x27;s ashes interred in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Vaud, Switzerland. The remains of Mason&#x27;s friend Charlie Chaplin are in a tomb a few steps away. Mason&#x27;s children specified that his headstone read: &quot;Never say in grief you are sorry he&#x27;s gone. Rather, say in thankfulness you are grateful he was here&quot;, words that were spoken to Portland Mason by U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy after the actor&#x27;s death.

<text>The Hustler is a 1959 debut novel by American writer Walter Tevis. It tells the story of a young pool hustler, Edward &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; Felson, who challenges the legendary Minnesota Fats. The novel was well-received by critics, and was adapted into a 1961 film of the same title, starring Paul Newman as Fast Eddie, Jackie Gleason as Minnesota Fats, and Piper Laurie as Sarah. A sequel, &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, was published in 1984.

==Synopsis==
Eddie &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; Felson is a young pool hustler from Oakland, California, who travels the country with his middle-aged partner Charlie Fenniger, pretending to be a worse pool player than he actually is to win bets. He goes with Charlie to Chicago, where he plays the legendary pool player George Hegerman, known as Minnesota Fats, at Brannigan&#x27;s pool hall. After beating Fats in a number of games, at one time being ahead of him by $18,000, he gets drunk and proceeds to lose to Fats, collapsing exhausted after 40 hours of playing. Eddie leaves Charlie without saying goodbye and returns to hustling. 

Eddie meets a college student, Sarah, at a bus station. They commence an affair and begin to live together. Returning to Brannigan&#x27;s he encounters Bert, a professional gambler, who tells Eddie that despite his talent he lost to Fats due to lack of character, as well as an ingrained eagerness to lose. Nevertheless he offers to back him in a game with a rich pool player in Kentucky named Findlay, taking 75 percent of any winnings while absorbing all losses and paying expenses. Eddie turns him down and resumes hustling. Disregarding Bert&#x27;s advice, he hustles pool at a pool hall patronized by tough migrants from Appalachia. They break his thumbs. 

After recuperating at Sarah&#x27;s apartment, he accepts Bert&#x27;s offer. Leaving Sarah behind in Chicago, they travel to Kentucky and Eddie plays Findlay at his home in Lexington. It turns out that Findlay plays billiards, not pool, which puts Eddie at a disadvantage. During the game he realizes that Findlay is a billiard hustler. Though chagrined that he is being &quot;hustled,&quot; Eddie has an epiphany. Watching Findlay falter, he realizes the validity of what Bert had been telling him about winning being everything, how people crave an excuse to lose, and how character is as important as skill. Despite continual pain in his thumbs, he wins against Findlay. He and Bert drive back to Chicago, where Eddie reunites with Sarah but does not move back in with her. He returns to Brannigan&#x27;s where he sees Charlie, who says that he had been worried about him and flew out from Oakland to find him. He confesses that he had held out $5,000 in winnings and pays it to him. Eddie proceeds to play Minnesota Fats with his own money, and beats him. 

Bert demands thirty percent of his winnings and says that he is his manager. Charlie backs him up. Eddie rejects paying Bert any money and shrugs off Bert&#x27;s threat to have his thumbs and an arm broken, and ridicules Bert&#x27;s intimation that he has criminal connections. As the novel ends, Eddie and Bert are at a stalemate.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;New York Times&quot; critic Rex Lardner called the book &quot;a tense, jolting trip to the tough, dusty, smoky, ball-clackety, money-filled world of the pool shark,&quot; and wrote that Tevis &quot;writes like a streak, making straight pool as exciting as a Stanley Ketchell fight. This is a fine, swift, wanton, offbeat novel.&quot;

An unsigned review in &quot;Time&quot; said that &quot;The Hustler&quot; &quot;has its faults as a novel, but opens the door on a world that books have not yet made commonplace&quot;. It went on to say that: &quot;The moral of &quot;The Hustler&quot; is obviously sententious, the love story is a cliche, and author Tevis&#x27; writing is sometimes too painfully exact. What remains is a succession of scenes in which a smoky, seedy world becomes sharply alive, and where crises are intense even though the scene is grubby and the game is only pool.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called it a &quot;compact, tidy novel&quot;, and said: &quot;Through a language of casual statement which does not disguise the seriousness of its intent, this exploration of moral experience is a pithy and competent performance.&quot;

== Background ==
Tevis grew up in Kentucky, and became good friends with a youth whose father bought him a pool table to keep him out of trouble. He was introduced to gambling when he was in the Navy, and a writer for &quot;Kentucky Monthly&quot; observed in 2019 that &quot;The combination of pool and gambling started the clock ticking toward what was to come.&quot; He called himself as a &quot;B-minus&quot; pool player who could not play professionals with any hope of winning.

The pool rooms described in the book were fictionalized by Tevis, and he insisted that despite claims by Rudolf Wanderone to be the model of the character, Minnesota Fats was entirely fictional. He told an interviewer in 1981: &quot;A lot of people ask me, &#x27;When did you first meet Minnesota Fats?&#x27; And I feel like Walt Disney being asked, &#x27;When did you meet Donald Duck?&#x27; Come on, I made him up. One of my contributions to American folklore.&quot; Tevis has described Fast Eddie&#x27;s hometown of Oakland as a &quot;disguised autobiographical reference&quot; to San Francisco, where Tevis was born.

A pool player named Eddie Parker asserted that he was the basis for the Fast Eddie character. But Tevis maintained that Fast Eddie was fictitious, and he resented assertions to the contrary, that he had &quot;created such memorable characters out of mere reportage&quot;. After his death in 1984, his widow debunked claims for years that the Fast Eddie character was based on a real person. 

In 2019, a researcher examined the novel&#x27;s original manuscript and found that Tevis had changed the character name from &quot;New York Fats&quot; to &quot;Minnesota Fats,&quot; lending credence to the claim of Rudolf Wanderone, who called himself &quot;New York Fats,&quot; that he was the inspiration for the character.

<text>In nuclear physics, a decay product (also known as a daughter product, daughter isotope, radio-daughter, or daughter nuclide) is the remaining nuclide left over from radioactive decay. Radioactive decay often proceeds via a sequence of steps (decay chain). For example, 238U decays to 234Th which decays to 234mPa which decays, and so on, to 206Pb (which is stable):

:formula_1

In this example:
* 234Th, 234mPa...,206Pb are the decay products of 238U.
* 234Th is the daughter of the parent 238U.
* 234mPa (234 metastable) is the granddaughter of 238U.
These might also be referred to as the daughter products of 238U.

Decay products are important in understanding radioactive decay and the management of radioactive waste.

For elements above lead in atomic number, the decay chain typically ends with an isotope of lead or bismuth. Bismuth itself decays to thallium, but the decay is so slow as to be practically negligible.

In many cases, individual members of the decay chain are as radioactive as the parent, but far smaller in volume/mass. Thus, although uranium is not dangerously radioactive when pure, some pieces of naturally occurring pitchblende are quite dangerous owing to their radium-226 content, which is soluble and not a ceramic like the parent. Similarly, thorium gas mantles are very slightly radioactive when new, but become more radioactive after only a few months of storage as the daughters of 232Th build up.

Although it cannot be predicted whether any given atom of a radioactive substance will decay at any given time, the decay products of a radioactive substance are extremely predictable. Because of this, decay products are important to scientists in many fields who need to know the quantity or type of the parent product. Such studies are done to measure pollution levels (in and around nuclear facilities) and for other matters.

<doc id="74391" wikidata="Q1070468" url="?curid=74391" title="The Immigrant (1917 film)">
<text>The Immigrant is a 1917 American silent romantic comedy short written and directed by Charlie Chaplin. The film stars Chaplin&#x27;s Tramp character as an immigrant coming to the United States who is accused of theft on the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean and falls in love with a beautiful young woman along the way. It also stars Edna Purviance and Eric Campbell.

According to Kevin Brownlow and David Gill&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot;, the first scenes to be written and filmed take place in what became the movie&#x27;s second half, in which the penniless Tramp finds a coin and goes for a meal in a restaurant, not realizing that the coin has fallen out of his pocket. It was not until later that Chaplin&#x27;s Tramp was penniless because he had just arrived on a boat from Europe and used this notion as the basis for the first half. Purviance reportedly was required to eat so many plates of beans during the many takes to complete the restaurant sequence (in character as another immigrant who falls in love with Charlie) that she became physically ill.

The scene in which Chaplin&#x27;s character kicks an immigration officer was cited later as evidence of his anti-Americanism when he was forced to leave the United States in 1952. In 1998, &quot;The Immigrant&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
The film begins aboard a steamship crossing the Atlantic Ocean and initially showcases an unnamed immigrant&#x27;s misadventures, the Little Tramp (Chaplin), who finds himself in assorted mischief. The scene opens with Charlie bent double over the side of the ship, appearing to be seasick. Then it is revealed he is only fishing.

Much humor is derived from the heavy sway of the boat, with much sliding around the deck.

Charlie, among other things, plays cards, eats in the mess hall and avoids seasick passengers. Along the way, he befriends another unnamed immigrant (Purviance) who is traveling to America with her ailing mother. The two have been robbed by a pickpocket who loses the money to the Tramp in a card game. The Tramp, feeling sorry for the two penniless women, attempts to secretly place his winnings from his card game in the woman&#x27;s pocket but ends up being mistakenly accused of being a pickpocket. The woman manages to clear the Tramp&#x27;s name. Upon arrival in America, the passengers stare at the Statue of Liberty but once landed, the Tramp and the woman part company.

Later, hungry and broke, the Tramp finds a coin on the street outside a restaurant and pockets it. He doesn&#x27;t realize there is a hole in his pocket, and the coin has fallen straight through and is back on the ground. He enters the restaurant, where he orders a plate of beans, at first eating one bean at a time. There, he is reunited with the woman and discovers her mother is dead. The Tramp orders a second bowl of beans for her.

As they eat, they watch the restaurant&#x27;s burly head waiter (Campbell) and other waiters attack and forcibly eject a patron who is short 10 cents in paying his bill. The Tramp, intimidated by the waiter, checks and now realizes he has lost his coin. Terrified of facing the same treatment as the man he saw thrown out, the Tramp begins planning how he will fight the huge man. However, a stranger enters, flaunting the coin he found outside. When the headwaiter takes the coin, it also falls from his pocket onto the floor. The Tramp then makes many failed attempts to retrieve it without notice. He finally retrieves the coin and nonchalantly pays the waiter, only to be thunderstruck when the waiter reveals the coin to be fake. Once again, the Tramp prepares for the fight of his life. Just then, a visiting artist spots the Tramp and the woman and offers them a job to pose for a painting. The two agree. The artist offers to pay for the Tramp and the woman&#x27;s meal, but the Tramp declines the offer several times for reasons of etiquette, intending to accept the artist&#x27;s offer eventually; however, he&#x27;s dismayed when the artist does not renew his offer to pay at the last moment. The artist pays for his own meal and leaves a tip for the waiter. The Tramp notices that the tip is enough to cover the couple&#x27;s meal and, without the artist noticing, palms the tip and presents it to the waiter as his payment for his and the woman&#x27;s meal. As a final riposte, he lets the waiter keep the remaining change - one small coin - after paying his bill. The waiter thinks the artist himself has given no tip whatsoever and is upset at this supposed action.

Afterward, outside a marriage license office in the rain, the Tramp proposes marriage to the woman, who is coy and reluctant until the Tramp physically carries her into the office while she waves her arms and kicks her feet in protest.

==Production==

Episode 1 of the 1983 documentary series &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot; reveals that Chaplin developed the storyline for &quot;The Immigrant&quot; as filming progressed. Initially, the movie began as a comedy set in an artists&#x27; cafe, with Purviance as a brightly dressed patron.

This plot was abandoned almost immediately, before Chaplin&#x27;s character was introduced, the documentary states, and Chaplin began again, with a story, still set in a cafe, about a man who has never been in a restaurant before displaying terrible table manners before meeting a lovely girl (Purviance) and shaping up. Initially, Henry Bergman played the bully-ish head waiter, but Chaplin eventually replaced him with Eric Campbell.

According to &quot;Unknown Chaplin&quot;, Chaplin developed the idea of the tramp and Purviance&#x27;s character being immigrants when he realized he needed more plot to justify the restaurant scenes. After filming the film&#x27;s opening sequences of the arrival in America, he reshot parts of the restaurant scene to be consistent with the new plot (bringing Bergman back in a new role as an artist who resolves the subplot of Charlie being unable to pay for dinner), and added the epilogue in which the Tramp and Purviance are married.

==Sound version==
In 1932, Amedee Van Beuren of Van Beuren Studios, purchased Chaplin&#x27;s Mutual comedies for $10,000 each, added music by Gene Rodemich and Winston Sharples and sound effects, and re-released them through RKO Radio Pictures. Chaplin had no legal recourse to stop the RKO release.

==Reception==
Like many American films of the time, &quot;The Immigrant&quot; was subjected to some cuts by city and state film censorship boards. The Chicago Board of Censors required two cuts to the film, the first being the closeup showing the stealing of a moneybag, and the second involving nose thumbing as an insult.

<doc id="74392" wikidata="Q2515304" url="?curid=74392" title="In the Land of the Head Hunters">
<text>In the Land of the Head Hunters (also called In the Land of the War Canoes) is a 1914 silent film fictionalizing the world of the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw peoples of the Queen Charlotte Strait region of the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, written and directed by Edward S. Curtis and acted entirely by Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw native people.

The film was selected in 1999 for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.&quot; It was the first feature-length film whose cast was composed entirely of Native North Americans; the second, eight years later, was Robert Flaherty&#x27;s &quot;Nanook of the North&quot;. Most of the film was shot on the Deer Island near Fort Rupert, British Columbia. It was the first feature film made in British Columbia, and is the oldest surviving feature film made in Canada.

==Original release==
Curtis had earlier experimented with multimedia. In 1911 he created a stage show with slides, a lecture, and live musical accompaniment, called &quot;The Indian Picture Opera&quot;. He used stereopticon projectors, where two projectors dissolved back and forth between images. This was his prelude to entering the motion picture era.

The film opened in New York City and Seattle, Washington in December 1914, with live performances of a score by John J. Braham, had access to wax cylinder recordings of Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw music, and the promotional campaign at the time suggested that his score was based on these; in fact, there were few snatches of Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw music in the score. Curtis hoped the film would be successful enough to fund the completion of &quot;The North American Indian&quot;, a multi-volume history of every indigenous tribe on the continent he had been working on since 1906. Although critically praised, the film was a commercial failure. Curtis spent approximately $75,000 to make the film, but it only earned $3,269.18 after a year in theaters. He was so disappointed with the film&#x27;s financial performance that he sold all the rights to the film to the New York Museum of Natural History in 1919 or 1920. When the museum lost Curtis&#x27;s donated material, the film was considered lost until 1947.

==Salvaging the film and score==
A single damaged, incomplete print of the film was salvaged from a dumpster by film collector Hugo Zeiter of Danville Illinois and donated to Chicago&#x27;s Field Museum of Natural History in 1947. Bill Holm and George Quimby obtained a 16mm copy in 1965 and completed a re-edited version of the film in 1974, having added a soundtrack by Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw musicians, and released the result as &quot;In the Land of the War Canoes&quot;. Independently, some other damaged clips from the film made their way to the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The score had been filed at the library of the Getty Research Institute, but without a title that tied it to the film. The 2008 restoration brought together these materials. Milestone Films has announced plans to release a restored &quot;One-Hundredth Anniversary&quot; DVD of the film with the original score in 2014.

==Historical accuracy==
&quot;In the Land of the Head Hunters&quot; has often been discussed as a flawed documentary film. The film combines many accurate representations of aspects of Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw culture, art, and technology from the era in which it was made with a melodramatic plot based on practices that either dated from long before the first contact of the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw with people of European descent or were entirely fictional. Curtis appears never to have specifically presented the film as a documentary, but he also never specifically called it a work of fiction.

Some aspects of the film do have documentary accuracy: the artwork, the ceremonial dances, the clothing, the architecture of the buildings, and the construction of the dugout, or a war canoe reflected Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw culture. Other aspects of the film were based on the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw&#x27;s orally transmitted traditions or on aspects of other neighboring cultures. The film also accurately portrays Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw rituals that were, at the time, prohibited by Canada&#x27;s potlatch prohibition, enacted in 1884 and not rescinded until 1951.

However, as is noted by the producers who supervised the centennial restoration of the film,

<text>Saumur () is a commune in the Maine-et-Loire department in western France.

The town is located between the Loire and Thouet rivers, and is surrounded by the vineyards of Saumur itself, Chinon, Bourgueil, Coteaux du Layon, etc.. Saumur station has rail connections to Tours, Angers, La Roche-sur-Yon and Nantes.

==Toponymy==
First attested in the Medieval Latin form of &quot;Salmuri&quot; in 968 AD, the origin of the name is obscure. Albert Dauzat hypothesized a pre-Celtic unattested element &quot;*sala&quot; &#x27;marshy ground&#x27; (&quot;cf.&quot; Celtic &quot;salm&quot; &#x27;which jumps and flows&#x27;), followed by another unattested element meaning &quot;wall&quot;. Many places in Europe seem to contain &quot;*Sal(m)-&quot; elements, which may share Old European roots.

==History==
The Dolmen de Bagneux on the south of the town, is 23 meters long and is built from 15 large slabs of the local stone, weighing over 500 tons. It is the largest in France.

The Château de Saumur was constructed in the 10th century to protect the Loire River crossing from Norman attacks after the settlement of Saumur was sacked in 845. The castle, destroyed in 1067 and inherited by the House of Plantagenet, was rebuilt by Henry II of England in the later 12th century. It changed hands several times between Anjou and France until 1589.

Houses in Saumur are constructed almost exclusively of Tuffeau stone. The caves dug to excavate the stone are now often used as commercial wine cellars.

Amyraldism, or the School of Saumur, is a distinctive form of Reformed theology taught by Moses Amyraut at the University of Saumur in the 17th century. Saumur is also the scene for Balzac&#x27;s novel &quot;Eugénie Grandet&quot;, written in 1833.

Prior to the French Revolution, Saumur was the capital of the , a bailiwick which existed until 1793. Saumur was the location of the Battle of Saumur during the Revolt in the Vendée. It hosted a state prison under Napoleon. The town was an equestrian centre with both the military cavalry school from 1783 and later the Cadre Noir equestrian team.

===World War II===
During the Battle of France in World War II, Saumur was the site of the Battle of Saumur (1940); the town and south bank of the Loire were defended by the teenage cadets of the cavalry school.

In 1944 it was the target of the first Tallboy and the fourth Azon bombing raids by Allied planes. On 8/9 June 1944, Tallboy &quot;earthquake&quot; bombs were first used, against a railway tunnel near Saumur. The hastily organized night raid was to stop a planned German Panzer Division, travelling to engage the newly landed allied forces in Normandy. The panzers were expected to use the railway to cross the Loire. No. 83 Squadron RAF illuminated the area with flares from four Avro Lancasters and marked the target at low level by three de Havilland Mosquitos. 25 Lancasters of No. 617 Squadron RAF, the &quot;Dambusters&quot; then dropped their Tallboys from with great accuracy. They hit the approaches to the bridge, blocked the railway cutting and one pierced the roof of the tunnel, bringing down a huge quantity of rock and soil which blocked the tunnel, badly delaying the German reinforcements moving towards Normandy, especially 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich. The damaged tunnel was quickly dug out to make a deeper cutting, resulting in the need for a second attack.

On 22 June, nine Consolidated B-24 Liberators of the United States Army Air Forces used the new Azon glide bombs against the Saumur rail bridge; escorted by 43 North American P-51 Mustangs. They failed to destroy the bridge. During the morning of 24 June, 38 American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses with conventional bombs attacked the bridge; escort was provided by 121 of 135 P-51s. The bridge was damaged.

The town of Saumur was awarded the Croix de Guerre with palm for its resistance and display of French patriotism during the war.

==Main attractions==

Saumur is home to the Cadre Noir, the École Nationale d&#x27;Équitation (National Equestrian School), known for its annual horse shows, as well as the Armoured Branch and Cavalry Training School, the officer school for armored forces (tanks).

There is the national tank museum, the Musée des Blindés, with more than 850 armored vehicles, wheeled or tracked. Most of them are from France, though some come from other countries such as Brazil, Germany, and the Soviet Union, as well as axis and allied vehicles of World War Two.

The annual military &quot;Carrousel&quot; takes place in July each year, as it has done for over 160 years, with displays of horse cavalry skills, historic and modern military vehicles.

Amongst the most important monuments of Saumur are the great Château de Saumur itself which stands high above the town, and the nearby Château de Beaulieu which stands just 200 metres from the south bank of the Loire River and which was designed by the architect Jean Drapeau. A giant sequoia tree (which is protected) stands in the grounds of Château de Beaulieu. The Dolmen de Bagneux is on the old road going south.

The architectural character of the town owes much to the fact that it is constructed almost exclusively of Tuffeau stone.

The wine industry surrounds Saumur, many utilising the tunnels as cellars with the hundreds of domaines producing white, red, rosé and sparkling wines. Visits to producers and the annual &quot;Grandes Tablées du Saumur-Champigny&quot; is an annual event held in early August with over 1 km of tables set up in Saumur so people can sample the local foods and wine.

Saumur has a weekly market every Saturday morning with hundreds of stalls open for business in the streets and squares of the old town, from before 8am.

<doc id="74394" wikidata="Q45386" url="?curid=74394" title="Invasion of the Body Snatchers">
<text>Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a 1956 American independent science-fiction horror film produced by Walter Wanger, directed by Don Siegel, and starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter. The black-and-white film was shot in 2.00:1 Superscope and in the film noir style. Daniel Mainwaring adapted the screenplay from Jack Finney&#x27;s 1954 science-fiction novel &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot;. The film was released by Allied Artists Pictures as a double feature with the British science-fiction film &quot;The Atomic Man&quot; (and in some markets with &quot;Indestructible Man&quot;).

The film&#x27;s storyline concerns an extraterrestrial invasion that begins in the fictional California town of Santa Mira. Alien plant spores have fallen from space and grown into large seed pods, each one capable of producing a visually identical copy of a human. As each pod reaches full development, it assimilates the physical traits, memories, and personalities of each sleeping person placed near it until only the replacement is left; these duplicates, however, are devoid of all human emotion. Little by little, a local doctor uncovers this &quot;quiet&quot; invasion and attempts to stop it.

The slang expression &quot;pod people&quot; that arose in late 20th-century U.S. culture refers to the emotionless duplicates seen in the film. &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;
==Plot==
A psychiatrist is called to the room of a Los Angeles hospital, where a man named Miles Bennell is being held in custody. The man claims to be a doctor, and recounts the events leading up to his arrest and arrival at the hospital.

At work, Bennell meets a number of patients suffering from Capgras delusion. His girlfriend, Becky, has just come back to town after settling a divorce. The couple are called to the home of a friend of the doctor, Jack Belicec, who has found what appears to be a body in his home. It has no features or fingerprints, and starts to change, beginning to take on the features of Belicec. Another body is found in Becky&#x27;s basement that is her duplicate. Before any further investigation can take place, the bodies disappear.

Bennell and Jack&#x27;s wife Teddy find duplicates of themselves emerging from pods in Bennell&#x27;s greenhouse. They conclude that the townspeople are being replaced while asleep with copies. Bennell tries to make a call to authorities, but the operator claims that all lines are busy and he cannot be put through, so Jack and Teddy drive off to seek help in the next town over. Bennell and Becky realize that all of Santa Mira&#x27;s inhabitants have been replaced and are devoid of any sort of humanity. They hide at Bennell&#x27;s office for the night.

Truckloads of the pods arrive downtown. Becky and Bennell listen as chief Nick Grivett directs the others to take them to towns to be planted and used to replace their populations. Kauffman and Belicec arrive at Bennell&#x27;s office with pods for Becky and Bennell. It is revealed that a race of alien impostors is responsible for the invasion, and that if they are not stopped, humanity will lose all emotions and sense of individuality.

Bennell and Becky escape from the office. To avoid capture, they mimic the impostors&#x27; mannerisms and pretend to be part of the huge crowd of replaced townspeople. However, a panicked Becky screams at a near-traffic accident and her reaction exposes their humanity to the aliens. An alarm is sounded and the couple flees on foot.

The couple manage to escape and hide in a mine outside town; however, after a while hiding they hear music, and Bennell leaves Becky briefly to investigate. He sees a farm with hundreds of pods being loaded onto trucks. Bennell returns to tell Becky, but realizes that she fell asleep before he could return and is now one of them. Becky sounds the alarm as Bennell runs away. Desperate, he screams at the drivers in the highway for help.

Bennell finishes his story. Dr. Hill and the doctor step outside into the hallway. A driver is wheeled into the hall on a gurney after having been injured in an accident. The attendant recounts that the man had to be dug out from under a load of mysterious pods coming from Santa Mira. Dr. Hill alerts the police to block the roads in and out of Santa Mira. The film ends with Bennell relieved as Hill calls the Bureau of Investigation.

==Production==
===Novel and screenplay===
Jack Finney&#x27;s novel ends with the extraterrestrials, who have a lifespan of no more than five years, leaving Earth after they realize that humans are offering strong resistance, despite having little reasonable chance against the alien invasion.

===Budgeting and casting===
&quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; was originally scheduled for a 24-day shoot and a budget of US$454,864. The studio later asked Wanger to cut the budget significantly. The producer proposed a shooting schedule of 20 days and a budget of $350,000.

Initially, Wanger considered Gig Young, Dick Powell, Joseph Cotten, and several others for the role of Miles. For Becky, he considered casting Anne Bancroft, Donna Reed, Kim Hunter, Vera Miles, and others. With the lower budget, however, he abandoned these choices and cast Richard Kiley, who had just starred in &quot;The Phenix City Story&quot; for Allied Artists. Kiley turned the role down and Wanger cast Kevin McCarthy, an Academy Award nominee five years earlier for &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, and relative newcomer Dana Wynter, who had done several major dramatic roles on television.

Future director Sam Peckinpah had a small part as Charlie, a meter reader. Peckinpah was a dialogue coach on five Siegel films in the mid-1950s, including this one.

===Principal photography===
Originally, producer Wanger and Siegel wanted to film &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; on location in Mill Valley, California, the town just north of San Francisco, that Jack Finney described in his novel. In the first week of January 1955, Siegel, Wanger, and screenwriter Daniel Mainwaring visited Finney to talk about the film version and to look at Mill Valley. The location proved too expensive, and Siegel with Allied Artist executives, found locations resembling Mill Valley in the Los Angeles area, including Sierra Madre, Chatsworth, Glendale, Los Feliz, Bronson, and Beachwood Canyons, all of which went on to make up the fictional town of &quot;Santa Mira&quot; for the film. In addition to these outdoor locations, much of the film was shot in the Allied Artists studio on the east side of Hollywood.

&quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; was shot by cinematographer Ellsworth Fredericks in 23 days between March 23 and April 27, 1955. The cast and crew worked a six-day week with Sundays off. The production went over schedule by three days because of the night-for-night shooting that Siegel wanted. Additional photography took place in September 1955, filming a frame story on which the studio had insisted (see Original intended ending). The final budget was $382,190.

===Post-production===
The project was originally named &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot; after the Finney serial, but Wanger wanted to avoid confusion with the 1945 Val Lewton film &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot;. The producer was unable to come up with a title and accepted the studio&#x27;s choice, &quot;They Come from Another World&quot; and that was assigned in summer 1955. Siegel objected to this title and suggested two alternatives, &quot;Better Off Dead&quot; and &quot;Sleep No More&quot;, while Wanger offered &quot;Evil in the Night&quot; and &quot;World in Danger&quot;. None of these was chosen, and the studio settled on &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; in late 1955. The film was released at the time in France under the mistranslated title (literally: &quot;Invasion of the defilers of tombs&quot;), which remains unchanged today.

Wanger wanted to add a variety of speeches and prefaces. He suggested a voice-over introduction for Miles. While the film was being shot, Wanger tried to get permission in England to use a Winston Churchill quotation as a preface to the film. The producer sought out Orson Welles to voice the preface and a trailer for the film. He wrote speeches for Welles&#x27; opening on June 15, 1955, and worked to persuade Welles to do it, but was unsuccessful. Wanger considered science-fiction author Ray Bradbury, instead, but this did not happen, either. Mainwaring eventually wrote the voice-over narration himself.

The studio scheduled three film previews on the last days of June and the first day of July 1955. According to Wanger&#x27;s memoranda at the time, the previews were successful. Later reports by Mainwaring and Siegel, however, contradict this, claiming that audiences could not follow the film and laughed in the wrong places. In response, the studio removed much of the film&#x27;s humor, &quot;humanity&quot;, and &quot;quality&quot;, according to Wanger. He scheduled another preview in mid-August that also did not go well. In later interviews, Siegel pointed out studio policy was to not mix humor with horror.

Wanger saw the final cut in December 1955 and protested the use of the Superscope aspect ratio. Its use had been included in early plans for the film, but the first print was not made until December. Wanger felt that the film lost sharpness and detail. Siegel originally shot &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Superscope was a post-production laboratory process designed to create an anamorphic print from nonanamorphic source material that would be projected at an aspect ratio of 2.00:1.

===Original intended ending ===
Both Siegel and Mainwaring were satisfied with the film as shot. The original ending did not include the flashback framing, and ended with Miles screaming as truckloads of pods pass him on the road. The studio, wary of a pessimistic conclusion, insisted on adding a prologue and epilogue suggesting a more optimistic outcome to the story, leading to the flashback framing. In this version, the film begins with Bennell in custody in a hospital emergency ward, telling a consulting psychiatrist (Whit Bissell) his story. In the closing scenes, pods are discovered at a highway accident, confirming Bennell&#x27;s warning, and the authorities are alerted, likely stopping the pod distribution and resolving the extraterrestrial threat.

Mainwaring scripted this framing story and Siegel shot it on September 16, 1955, at the Allied Artists studio. In a later interview, Siegel complained, &quot;The film was nearly ruined by those in charge at Allied Artists who added a preface and ending that I don&#x27;t like.&quot; In his autobiography Siegel added that &quot;Wanger was very much against this, as was I. However, he begged me to shoot it to protect the film, and I reluctantly consented [...].&quot;

While the Internet Movie Database states that the film had been revised to its original ending for a re-release in 1979, Steve Biodrowski of &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; magazine notes that the film was still being shown with the complete footage, including a 2005 screening at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honoring director Don Siegel.

Although most reviewers disliked it, George Turner (in &quot;American Cinematographer&quot;) and Danny Peary (in &quot;Cult Movies&quot;) endorsed the subsequently added frame story. Nonetheless, Peary emphasized that the added scenes changed significantly what he saw as the film&#x27;s original intention.

===Theatrical release===
When the film was released domestically in February 1956, many theaters displayed several pods made of &quot;papier-mâché&quot; in theater lobbies and entrances, along with large lifelike black-and-white cutouts of McCarthy and Wynter running away from a crowd. The film earned more than $1 million in the first month, and in 1956 alone earned more than $2.5 million in the U.S. When the film was released in the UK (with cuts imposed by the British censors) in late 1956, the film had more than a half-million dollars in ticket sales.

==Reception and legacy ==

===Critical reception===
Though &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; was largely ignored by critics on its initial run, Filmsite.org ranked it as one of the best films of 1956. The film holds a 98% approval rating and 9.1/10 rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;One of the best political allegories of the 1950s, &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; is an efficient, chilling blend of sci-fi and horror.&quot;

In recent years, critics such as Dan Druker of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; have called the film a &quot;genuine Sci-Fi classic.&quot; Leonard Maltin described &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; as &quot;influential, and still very scary.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; called the film one of the &quot;most resonant&quot; and &quot;one of the simplest&quot; of the genre. Mark Steyn described it as &quot;a big film&quot;, despite its limited budget.

&quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;Ten top Ten&quot;—the best 10 films in 10 &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling more than 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; was acknowledged as the 9th-best film in the science-fiction genre. The film was also placed on AFI&#x27;s &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Thrills&quot;, a list of America&#x27;s most heart-pounding films.

The film was included on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;. Similarly, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 29th scariest film ever made. IGN ranked it as the 15th-best sci-fi picture. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; on their list of 100 all-time best films, the top 10 1950s Sci-Fi Movies, and Top 25 Horror Films. In 1999, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed it as the 53rd best movie of all time. Similarly, the book &quot;Four Star Movies: The 101 Greatest Films of All Time&quot; placed the movie at #60.

&quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; might have influenced the Japanese tokusatsu film &quot;Warning from Space&quot;, which was released in Japan a week before the Siegel&#x27;s film.

===Themes ===
Some reviewers saw in the story a commentary on the dangers facing the United States for turning a blind eye to McCarthyism. Leonard Maltin wrote of a McCarthy-era subtext, or of bland conformity in postwar Eisenhower-era America. Others viewed it as an allegory for the loss of personal autonomy and individualism in the Soviet Union or communist systems in general.

For the BBC, David Wood summarized the circulating popular interpretations of the film as: &quot;The sense of postwar, anticommunist paranoia is acute, as is the temptation to view the film as a metaphor for the tyranny of the McCarthy era.&quot; Danny Peary in &quot;Cult Movies&quot; pointed out that the studio-mandated addition of the framing story had changed the film&#x27;s stance from anti-McCarthyite to anti-communist. Michael Dodd of &quot;The Missing Slate&quot; has called the movie &quot;one of the most multifaceted horror films ever made&quot;, arguing that by &quot;simultaneously exploiting the contemporary fear of infiltration by undesirable elements, as well as a burgeoning concern over homeland totalitarianism in the wake of Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s notorious communist witch hunt, it may be the clearest window into the American psyche that horror cinema has ever provided.&quot;

In &quot;An Illustrated History of the Horror Film&quot;, Carlos Clarens saw a trend manifesting itself in science-fiction films, dealing with dehumanization and fear of the loss of individual identity, being historically connected to the end of &quot;the Korean War and the well-publicized reports of brainwashing techniques.&quot; Comparing &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; with Robert Aldrich&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; and Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;, Brian Neve found a sense of disillusionment rather than straightforward messages, with all three films being &quot;less radical in any positive sense than reflective of the decline of [the screenwriters&#x27;] great liberal hopes.&quot;

Despite a general agreement among film critics regarding these political connotations of the film, actor Kevin McCarthy said in an interview included on the 1998 DVD release that he felt no political allegory was intended. The interviewer stated that he had spoken with the author of the novel, Jack Finney, who professed no specific political allegory in the work.

In his autobiography, &quot;I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History&quot;, Walter Mirisch writes: &quot;People began to read meanings into pictures that were never intended. &quot;The Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; is an example of that. I remember reading a magazine article arguing that the picture was intended as an allegory about the communist infiltration of America. From personal knowledge, neither Walter Wanger nor Don Siegel, who directed it, nor Dan Mainwaring, who wrote the script nor original author Jack Finney, nor myself, saw it as anything other than a thriller, pure and simple.&quot;

Don Siegel spoke more openly of an existing allegorical subtext, but denied a strictly political point of view: &quot;[...] I felt that this was a very important story. I think that the world is populated by pods and I wanted to show them. I think so many people have no feeling about cultural things, no feeling of pain, of sorrow. [...] The political reference to Senator McCarthy and totalitarianism was inescapable but I tried not to emphasize it because I feel that motion pictures are primarily to entertain and I did not want to preach.&quot; Film scholar J.P. Telotte wrote that Siegel intended for pods to be seductive; their spokesperson, a psychiatrist, was chosen to provide an authoritative voice that would appeal to the desire to &quot;abdicate from human responsibility in an increasingly complex and confusing modern world.&quot;

===Subsequent adaptations===
Three subsequent adaptations of &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot; have been made: &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1978), &quot;Body Snatchers&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Invasion&quot; (2007).

An untitled fourth adaptation from Warner Bros. was reported to be in development in 2017. David Leslie Johnson was signed to be the screenwriter.

It briefly inspired &quot;Assimilate&quot; (2019), which is also inspired by &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot; of the same name.

The film inspired the ABC TV series &quot;Invasion&quot; (2005 TV series), a subplot in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Another Life&quot; (2019 TV series), and the Disney+ series &quot;Goosebumps: The Vanishing&quot; (2025 TV series).

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD in 1998 by U.S.-label Republic (an identical re-release by Artisan followed in 2002); it includes the Superscope version plus a 1.375:1 Academy ratio version. The latter is not the original full frame edition but a pan and scan reworking of the Superscope edition that loses visual detail.

DVD editions exist on the British market (including a computer-colorized version), German market (as &quot;&quot;), and Spanish market (as ).

Several Blu-ray Disc versions have been released, including two bare-bones Blu-ray Disc editions by Olive Films in 2012 and German company Al!ve (under the title ) in 2018. Sinister Films released a Blu-ray in Italy on March 18, 2014. This version, under the title , contained many special features, including an interview with lead actor Kevin McCarthy and the 1957 &quot;Studio One&quot; episode entitled &quot;The Night America Trembled&quot;, an unreleased filmed reconstruction of the famous Orson Welles radio transmission &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, starring Ed Asner, James Coburn, and Warren Beatty. Olive Films subsequently released a special-edition Blu-ray in 2018, containing extensive bonus features including several featurettes, two audio commentaries, one with film historian Richard Harland Smith and a second with Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter, and filmmaker Joe Dante, and a 1985 archival interview with McCarthy.

==Related works==
Robert A. Heinlein had previously developed this subject in his 1951 novel &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;, written in 1950. &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot; was later plagiarized as the 1958 film &quot;The Brain Eaters&quot;, and adapted under contract in the 1994 film &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;.

Several thematically related works followed Finney&#x27;s 1955 novel &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot;, including Val Guest&#x27;s &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; and Gene Fowler&#x27;s &quot;I Married a Monster from Outer Space&quot;.

The 1986 film Troll has a snippet of a movie seen on TV in which Spot (a dog) and Tweetie (a canary) are declared to be pod persons.

A Looney Tunes parody of the film was released, entitled &quot;Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers&quot; (1992). The adaptation was directed by Greg Ford and places Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Porky Pig in the various roles of the story.

In 2018, theater company Team Starkid created the musical parody &quot;The Guy Who Didn&#x27;t Like Musicals&quot;, the story of a Midwestern town that is overtaken by a singing alien hivemind. The musical parodies numerous horror and musical tropes, while the main character also wears within the show a suit reminiscent of Bennell&#x27;s wardrobe.

The May 1981 issue of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; featured a parody titled &quot;Invasion of the Money Snatchers&quot;; the gentile population of Whiteville is taken over by pastrami sandwiches from outer space and turned into Jews.

The Host segments of the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; episode &quot;The Giant Spider Invasion&quot; parody this film. In the episode, as Pearl, Brain Guy, and &quot;Professor Bobo&quot; are out camping, they end up discovering flowers that they nickname &quot;Zucchini Throw Pillows&quot; which are actually Body Snatcher Aliens in disguise. They end up getting sent to the Satellite of Love along with the titular movie, causing Pearl, Brain Guy, and all the Bots (except Mike and Bobo) to become affected. Per Mike&#x27;s encouragement, Bobo manages to save everyone by destroying the mother body snatcher alien, killing all the aliens and turning everyone affected back to normal. But because Pearl missed out on the SOL Crew&#x27;s reactions to the movie, she forces them to watch it again.

&quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot;, a 1982 film with similar themes involving androids, is also largely set in a California town named Santa Mira.

The film was also parodied in the 2012 &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;Planet of the Jellyfish&quot; (referencing &quot;Planet of the Vampires&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;) featuring characters from Bikini Bottom being replaced by alien clones in their sleep.

<text>Kenneth Patchen (December 13, 1911January 8, 1972) was an American poet and novelist. He experimented with different forms of writing and incorporated painting, drawing, and jazz music into his works, which have been compared with those of William Blake and Walt Whitman. Patchen&#x27;s biographer wrote that he &quot;developed in his fabulous fables, love poems, and picture poems a deep yet modern mythology that conveys a sense of compassionate wonder amidst the world&#x27;s violence.&quot; Along with his friend and peer Kenneth Rexroth, he was a central influence on the San Francisco Renaissance and the Beat Generation.

== Early years ==
===Background===

Patchen was born in Niles, Ohio. His father, Wayne, worked in the nearby steel mills of Youngstown, which Patchen would reference in his poems &quot;The Orange Bears&quot; and &quot;May I Ask You a Question, Mr. Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube?&quot; Patchen kept a diary from the age of twelve and read Dante, Homer, Burns, Shakespeare, and Melville.

His family included his mother Eva, his sisters Ruth, Magel, Eunice, and Kathleen, and his brother Hugh. In 1926, while Patchen was still a teenager, his younger sister Kathleen was struck and killed by an automobile. Her death deeply affected him and he would later pay tribute to her in his 1948 poem &quot;In Memory of Kathleen.&quot;

Patchen first began to develop his interest in literature and poetry while he was in high school, and the &quot;New York Times&quot; published his first poem while he was still in college. He attended Alexander Meiklejohn&#x27;s Experimental College (which was part of the University of Wisconsin), in Madison, Wisconsin, for one year, starting in 1929. Patchen had a football scholarship there but had to drop out when he injured his back. After leaving school, Patchen travelled across the country, taking itinerant jobs in such places as Arkansas, Louisiana, and Georgia.

=== Marriage ===

Next, Patchen moved to the East Coast, where he lived in New York City and Boston. While in Boston, in 1933, he met Miriam Oikemus at a friend&#x27;s Christmas party. At the time, Miriam was a freshman at Massachusetts State College in Amherst. The two kept in touch, and Patchen started sending her the first of many love poems. They soon fell in love and decided to get married. First Patchen took her to meet his parents in Youngstown. They were married on June 28, 1934, in nearby Sharon, Pennsylvania.

During the 1930s the couple moved frequently between New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village and California, as Patchen struggled to make a living as a writer. Despite his constant struggle, his strong relationship with Miriam supported him and would continue to support him through the hardships that plagued him for most of his adult life. The couple moved to a cottage in Old Lyme, Connecticut, in 1947. In 1951, a few years after befriending the West Coast poet Kenneth Rexroth, the Patchens moved to the West Coast, living first in San Francisco and then moving to Palo Alto in 1957.

=== Health problems ===

In 1937 Patchen suffered a permanent spinal injury, which was to give him pain, to varying degrees, for the rest of his life and which required multiple surgical procedures. In a letter to a friend from 1960, Patchen explained, &quot;In 1956 a spinal fusion [operation] (second of two operations) gave me relief and mobility (&amp; for the first time I was able to go about giving readings, and so on.&quot;

By this point, he and his wife had moved from San Francisco to Palo Alto to be closer to the Palo Alto Clinic, where both were receiving treatment. Then, in 1959, Patchen noted in the letter quoted above that another surgery at the Presbyterian Medical Center of San Francisco ended in disaster. He wrote, &quot;During [a] surgical procedure for my throat, and while under complete anesthesia, I suffered another slipped disc.&quot; Though he was heavily sedated during the procedure, Patchen suspected that he had been dropped at some point; in any event he was in considerably more pain afterward, and disabled for the rest of his life. In 1963, he sued his surgeon for medical malpractice and lost.

Around this time, Jim Morrison paid for the publication of the &quot;Mt. Alverno Review&quot;, a poetry anthology edited by his friend, Michael C. Ford, to help Patchen with medical expenses.

=== Politics ===

Throughout his life Patchen was a fervent pacifist, as he made clear in much of his work. He was strongly opposed to the involvement of the United States in World War II. In his own words, &quot;I speak for a generation born in one war and doomed to die in another.&quot; This controversial view, coupled with his physical immobilization, may have prevented wider recognition or success beyond what some consider a &quot;cult&quot; following.

=== Final years ===
Patchen lived out the final years of his life with his wife in their modest home on 2340 Sierra Court, in Palo Alto, where Patchen created many of his distinctive painted poems, produced while confined to his bed after his disastrous 1959 surgery inadvertently damaged his spine. He died in Palo Alto, on January 8, 1972. His wife, Miriam, died in March 2000, also in Palo Alto.

== Career ==
=== Writing ===
Patchen&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;Before the Brave&quot;, was published by Random House in 1936. His earliest collections of poetry were his most political and led to his being championed, in the 1930s, as a &quot;proletariat poet&quot;. This description, which Patchen rejected, never stuck, since his work varied widely in subject, style and form. As his career progressed, he continued to push himself into more and more experimental styles and forms, developing, along with writers such as Langston Hughes and Kenneth Rexroth, what came to be known as jazz poetry. He also experimented with his childlike &quot;painted poems,&quot; many of which were published posthumously in the 1984 collection &quot;What Shall We Do Without Us&quot;.

After the appearance of his first book, he and Miriam traveled to the Southwest and then moved to Hollywood in 1938, where he tried, unsuccessfully, writing film scripts and worked for the WPA. His next book of poems, &quot;First Will and Testament&quot;, drew the attention of James Laughlin, who was then launching New Directions Publishing as a student at Harvard. Laughlin&#x27;s decision to publish Patchen&#x27;s work started a relationship that would last for the remainder of both men&#x27;s careers. For a short time, in 1939, Patchen even took an office job working for New Directions. In addition to their professional relationship, Patchen and Laughlin also became good friends.

Patchen pioneered the &quot;drawing-and-poem form&quot; as well as the painting-and-poem form and produced over a thousand &quot;painted books&quot;, special copies of his own works with original paintings on the covers. His many hundreds of drawings and paintings have been described as being reminiscent of those of Blake and Klee. During the course of a long and varied career, he also tried his hand at writing experimental novels, such as &quot;The Journal of Albion Moonlight&quot; and &quot;The Memoirs of a Shy Pornographer&quot;, and the radio play &quot;The City Wears a Slouch Hat&quot;. Patchen&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; was first published in 1969, just a few years before his death.

=== Peers ===
One of Patchen&#x27;s biggest literary supporters was the novelist Henry Miller, who wrote a long essay on Patchen, entitled &quot;Patchen: Man of Anger and Light&quot;, in 1946. In this essay, Miller wrote, &quot;Patchen&#x27;s pacifism is closely tied to what he sees as the loss of innocence in society, the corrupted human spirit, and is often expressed with animals. Such is the case with the forbidding &#x27;The Lions of Fire Shall Have Their Hunting.&#x27;&quot; Patchen also had a close, lifelong friendship with the poet E.E. Cummings, which began when they were both living in Greenwich Village in the 1940s. Patchen was also a close peer of the West Coast poet Kenneth Rexroth, who shared Patchen&#x27;s antiwar radicalism and his interest in combining poetry readings with jazz accompaniment. The two poets began a correspondence in the late 1940s and continued it in the 1950s. Rexroth encouraged the Patchens to move to San Francisco in the early 1950s.

=== Influence ===
In the 1950s, Patchen became a major influence on the younger beat poets, including Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Miriam Patchen recalled some of these young poets, including Philip Lamantia, Gary Snyder, and Michael McClure, visiting the Patchens&#x27; home in San Francisco to pay their respects. However, once the Beats&#x27; popularity grew, Patchen disliked being associated with them and was highly critical of their glorification of drug use and what he perceived to be a strong desire for media attention and fame. Patchen referred to &quot;Ginsberg and Co.&quot; and the media hype surrounding them as a &quot;freak show.&quot;

=== Awards ===
In 1936, soon after the release of his first book, Patchen was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1944, he won the Ohioana Award for his book &quot;Cloth of the Tempest&quot;. He received the Shelley Memorial Award in 1954. He received a $10,000 grant for his contribution to American literature from the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities in 1967.

== Musical collaborations and recordings ==
In 1942 Patchen collaborated with the composer John Cage on the radio play &quot;The City Wears a Slouch Hat&quot;. In the 1950s Patchen collaborated with the jazz bassist and composer Charles Mingus, reading his poetry with Mingus&#x27; group, but no recordings of the collaboration are known to exist.

In the late 1950s Moe Asch of Folkways Records recorded Patchen reading his poetry and excerpts from one of his novels. These recordings were released as &quot;Kenneth Patchen Reads with Jazz in Canada&quot; (1959), &quot;Selected Poems of Kenneth Patchen&quot; (1960), &quot;Kenneth Patchen Reads His Love Poems&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Journal of Albion Moonlight&quot; (1972). &quot;Kenneth Patchen Reads with Jazz in Canada&quot; (1959) was recorded in Vancouver the same week as a live performance for CBC Radio. The original record included a mimeographed pamphlet featuring poems and credits for the jazz group who played on the record, the Allan Neil Quartet. It was re-released on CD by Locust Music in 2004.

In 196465, the English composer David Bedford set an extract from Patchen&#x27;s 1948 poem &quot;In Memory of Kathleen&quot; to classical music for the piece &quot;A Dream of the Lost Seven Stars&quot;.

In November 2004 the Peter Brötzmann Chicago Tentet presented &quot;A Homage to Kenneth Patchen&quot; at the Chicago Humanities Festival with Mike Pearson reading from &quot;The Collected Poems of Kenneth Patchen.&quot; A recording was released on the German jazzwerkstatt label entitled &quot;Be Music, Night&quot; in 2006. Musicians in the performance included Peter Brötzmann (clarinets, alto and tenor saxes), Mats Gustafsson (baritone sax, bass clarinet), Ken Vandermark (baritone sax, clarinet), Joe McPhee (trumpet, alto sax), Jeb Bishop (trombone), Fred Lonberg-Holm (cello), Kent Kessler (bass) and Paal Nilssen-Love and Michael Zerang (drums). In 1984 Brötzmann had recorded a solo dedication to Patchen for FMP titled &quot;14 Love Poems,&quot; a collection of short unaccompanied reed pieces that mirror textures and cadences found in the poet&#x27;s love poems.

On January 21, 2008, El Records released the record &quot;Rebel Poets in America&quot;, which included poetry readings with jazz accompaniment by both Patchen and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, including such Patchen classics as &quot;The Murder of Two Men by a Young Kid Wearing Lemon Colored Gloves&quot; and &quot;I Went to the City.&quot; Patchen made these recordings in collaboration with the musician Allyn Ferguson, who composed and arranged jazz accompaniment for each poem and also led the jazz ensemble.

In October 2011 the Claudia Quintet, with guest vocalists Kurt Elling and Theo Bleckmann, released an album on Cuneiform Records of Patchen&#x27;s poetry set to music written by Claudia leader John Hollenbeck.

== Critical response ==
Patchen&#x27;s work has received little attention from academic critics. However, a few scholars have published critical books on Patchen, including Raymond Nelson, Herbert P. Hogue, and Larry R. Smith. Also, a collection of essays on Patchen&#x27;s work was edited by Richard Morgan for the book &quot;Kenneth Patchen: A Collection of Essays&quot; (1977).

Notable book reviews provide a reasonably accurate gauge of the public response to Patchen&#x27;s work when it was initially published. For instance, Patchen biographer Larry Smith notes that &quot;[the] initial reception to Patchen&#x27;s &quot;First Will &amp; Testament&quot; was positive and strong.&quot; Smith notes that a reviewer from the &quot;New Republic&quot; compared the book to T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land.&quot; The book was also praised in reviews by Louis Untermeyer and John Peale Bishop. However, it received a notably negative review by Delmore Schwartz in &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. Following this first negative review, Schwartz would remain one of Patchen&#x27;s fiercest critics.

In response to Patchen&#x27;s novel &quot;The Journal of Albion Moonlight&quot; (1941), prior to its publication, Henry Miller praised the work in the long essay &quot;Patchen: Man of Anger and Light&quot;, which was published in book form in 1946. Also prior to the book&#x27;s publication, Delmore Schwartz read the manuscript and claimed to be so offended by its controversial antiwar stance that he persuaded Patchen&#x27;s publisher, New Directions, against publishing it. This forced Patchen to self-publish the book by subscription. Post-publication, the book&#x27;s supporters included Miller, Robert Duncan, and James Laughlin; its detractors included Schwartz, Edmund Wilson, and Anaïs Nin. Despite receiving a favorable review from William Carlos Williams in 1942, the novel&#x27;s highly experimental style, limited release, and antiwar stance would guarantee it a very limited audience.

In 1943, Patchen&#x27;s &quot;Cloth of the Tempest&quot; received largely negative reviews. One reviewer even accused Patchen of being &quot;naive,&quot; a common criticism aimed at his work, particularly regarding his fervent pacifist beliefs.

In the 1950s, Patchen received praise from the jazz critic Ralph Gleason for his jazz-poetry readings with the Chamber Jazz Sextet at the Blackhawk Club in San Francisco. Gleason wrote, &quot;I think [Patchen&#x27;s reading] technique presents the possibilities of an entire new medium of expression―a combination of jazz and poetry that would take nothing away from either form but would create something entirely new.&quot; When Patchen recorded his jazz-poetry readings, one of the resulting albums drew praise from the poet John Ciardi, who wrote that &quot;Patchen&#x27;s poetry is in many ways a natural for jazz accompaniment. Its subject and its tone are close to those of jazz.&quot;

In 1958, Patchen&#x27;s &quot;Selected Poems&quot; and his book &quot;When We Were Here Together&quot; received significant praise from the reviewer Frederick Eckman in &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine. Eckman favorably compared Patchen&#x27;s work to that of the poet William Blake and singled out the poems &quot;Street Corner College,&quot; &quot;Do the Dead Know What Time It Is?,&quot; &quot;The Origin of Baseball,&quot; &quot;Fog,&quot; and &quot;The Character of Love Seen As a Search for the Lost&quot; as some of Patchen&#x27;s best pieces. He called &quot;When We Were Here Together&quot; &quot;a beautiful book, inside and out.&quot; However, in the very same issue of &quot;Poetry&quot;, the reviewer Robert Beum wrote a brief, negative review of Patchen&#x27;s book &quot;Hurrah for Anything&quot;, calling it dull and clichéd.

Patchen&#x27;s most important volume, &quot;The Collected Poems of Kenneth Patchen&quot;, first published in 1968, received largely positive reviews. A reviewer for the &quot;New York Times&quot; called the book &quot;a remarkable volume&quot; and compared Patchen&#x27;s work to that of Walt Whitman, Hart Crane, and D. H. Lawrence and also compared it to the Bible. In another review, the poet David Meltzer called Patchen &quot;one of America&#x27;s great poet-prophets&quot; and called his body of work &quot;visionary art for our time and for Eternity.&quot; Like the &quot;Times&quot; reviewer, Meltzer also compared Patchen&#x27;s work to that of Walt Whitman and to the Bible and also to the writing of William Blake.

== Legacy ==
Although he did not achieve widespread fame during his lifetime, a small but dedicated following of fans and scholars continue to celebrate Patchen&#x27;s art. The University of California, Santa Cruz, hosts an archive of his work, entitled &quot;Patchenobilia,&quot; and many bookstores around the San Francisco Bay Area, Patchen&#x27;s final home, continue to host jazz and poetry events which include his works.

On Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s 1973 album  &quot;A White Sport Coat and A Pink Crustacean&quot;, the single &quot;Death of An Unpopular Poet&quot; is claimed by Buffett to have been inspired by Patchen and fellow poet Richard Farina. 

Between 1987 and 1991 there were Kenneth Patchen Festivals, celebrating his work, in Warren, Ohio, which encompasses the town of Niles, where Patchen was born and grew up. These festivals were sponsored by the Trumbull Art Gallery in collaboration with the University of California, Santa Cruz. The little street where he lived as a child was renamed Patchen Avenue by the town of Niles.

In 2007, Gallery 324 in the Galleria at Erieview in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, held a Kenneth Patchen Festival reception on April 13. Featured were Larry Smith of Bottom Dog Press, Doug Manson (SUNY, Buffalo) editor of Celery Flute Player (a Kenneth Patchen newsletter), numerous colorful Kenneth Patchen silkscreens on loan from the Trumbull Art Guild in Warren, and Douglas Paisley&#x27;s paintings of The Journal of Albion Moonlight with text. The following day, at the same gallery M.L. Liebler and the Magic Poetry Band from Detroit accompanied readings by poets Chris Franke, Jim Lang, and others. Later that night, the festival moved uptown to The Barking Spider Tavern in the University Circle area for poetry readings accompanied by the Cleveland band The John Richmond All-Stars.
In 2011, Kelly&#x27;s Cove Press published &quot;Kenneth Patchen: A Centennial Selection&quot;, edited by Patchen&#x27;s friend Jonathan Clark, in celebration of the centenary of Patchen&#x27;s birth.

In April 2012, Allen Frost published the &quot;Selected Correspondence of Kenneth Patchen&quot;, which includes letters between Patchen and James Laughlin, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Henry Miller, Amos Wilder, Dylan Thomas, Thomas Wolfe and E.E. Cummings.

A full-color collection of Patchen&#x27;s photos and art, &quot;An Astonished Eye: The Art of Kenneth Patchen,&quot; by Jonathan Clark, was published by Artichoke Press and the University of Rochester Library in 2014.

<doc id="74397" wikidata="Q357418" url="?curid=74397" title="Massive Attack">
<text>Massive Attack are an English trip hop collective formed in 1988 in Bristol, England by Robert &quot;3D&quot; Del Naja, Grant &quot;Daddy G&quot; Marshall, Adrian &quot;Tricky&quot; Thaws and Andrew &quot;Mushroom&quot; Vowles. The group currently consists of Del Naja and Marshall.

In 1991, they released their debut album, &quot;Blue Lines,&quot; which has been included on numerous best-of lists and is generally considered the first album of the &#x27;trip-hop&#x27; genre. The single &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; was a chart hit in Europe, including number one on the Dutch Top 40, and was later voted the 63rd-greatest song of all time in a poll by &quot;NME&quot;. In 1994, they released their second album &quot;Protection&quot;. Thaws left the band later that year to pursue a solo career. In 1998, they released their third album, &quot;Mezzanine&quot;, giving them their first number one on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Mezzanine&quot; also contains the top-10 single &quot;Teardrop&quot;, which earned further recognition as the opening theme of the American television series &quot;House&quot;. In 1999, Vowles left the band, with Del Naja and Marshall continuing as a duo. They further released the albums &quot;100th Window&quot; (2003) and &quot;Heligoland&quot; (2010). 

Both &quot;Blue Lines&quot; and &quot;Mezzanine&quot; feature in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The group have collaborated with several recurring guest vocalists, including Horace Andy, Shara Nelson, Tracey Thorn, Elizabeth Fraser, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Damon Albarn and Hope Sandoval.

Massive Attack&#x27;s awards include a Brit Award for Best British Dance Act, two MTV Europe Music Awards, and two Q Awards. Their five studio albums have sold over 13 million copies worldwide. Massive Attack are also known for supporting several political, human rights and environmental causes.

==History==
===The Wild Bunch and &quot;Any Love&quot; (1980s–1990)===
In the early 1980s, DJs Daddy G and Mushroom, and rappers Tricky and 3D met as members of partying collective the Wild Bunch. One of the first homegrown sound systems in the UK, the Wild Bunch became dominant on the Bristol club scene in the mid-1980s.

In 1988, Massive Attack was created as a spin-off quartet. Unsigned, the group (Mushroom, Daddy G, 3D and Tricky) put out &quot;Any Love&quot; as a single. It was co-produced by Bristol double-act Smith &amp; Mighty and featured the falsetto-voiced singer-songwriter Carlton McCarthy. In 1990, they committed to deliver six studio albums and a &quot;best of&quot; compilation to Circa Records. This record label became a subsidiary of, and was later subsumed into, Virgin Records, which in turn was acquired by EMI.

===&quot;Blue Lines&quot; and &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; (1991–1993)===
In 1989, 3D co-wrote Neneh Cherry&#x27;s &quot;Manchild&quot;. This working relationship continued with Cherry helping Massive Attack to record their first album &quot;Blue Lines&quot;. Cherry&#x27;s partner Cameron McVey was an executive producer of the album and became the group&#x27;s first manager. Cherry and McVey provided financial support, via the Cherry Bear organisation, and the album was partly recorded in their house. The band used guest vocalists, interspersed with their own &quot;sprechgesang&quot; stylings, on top of what became regarded as an essentially British creative sampling production; a trademark sound that fused hip hop, soul, reggae and other eclectic references, both musical and lyrical. The album used vocalists including Horace Andy and Shara Nelson, a former Wild Bunch cohort. MC Willie Wee, also once part of the Wild Bunch, featured. Neneh Cherry sang backing vocals on environmentalist anthem, &quot;Hymn of the Big Wheel&quot;. Co-production was also provided by Jonny Dollar.

&quot;Blue Lines&quot; was released on 8 April 1991 on Virgin Records. The album has been retrospectively considered the first of the &quot;trip-hop&quot; genre and received critical acclaim.

That year they released &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; as a single, a string-arranged track at Abbey Road studio, scored by Will Malone. The group temporarily shortened their name to &quot;Massive&quot; on the advice of McVey to avoid controversy relating to the Gulf War. They returned to being &quot;Massive Attack&quot; for their next single, &quot;Safe from Harm&quot;.

===&quot;Protection&quot; and Melankolic (1994–1997)===

For their second album, the band brought in Everything but the Girl&#x27;s Tracey Thorn and Nicolette as vocalists and released &quot;Protection&quot; on 26 September 1994.

With McVey out of the picture, Massive Attack enlisted the production talents of former Wild Bunch Nellee Hooper to co-produce some songs on it, with Mushroom. Other tracks were co-produced by the Insects and 3D. A dub version, &quot;No Protection&quot;, was released the following year by Mad Professor. &quot;Protection&quot; won a Brit award for Best Dance Act. The other collaborators on &quot;Protection&quot; were Marius de Vries and Craig Armstrong, a Scottish classical pianist.

In 1995, Tricky decided to end his involvement with the band in order to pursue a solo career. The crediting of Tricky&#x27;s contribution for &quot;Blue Lines&quot; was also a source of friction. This was also the period of the release of Tricky&#x27;s &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; and Portishead&#x27;s &quot;Dummy&quot;. The term &quot;trip hop&quot; was coined and was referred to by the media as part of the &quot;Bristol scene&quot;.

In 1995, Massive Attack started a label distributed by Virgin/EMI, Melankolic, and signed Craig Armstrong and a number of other artists such as Horace Andy, Lewis Parker, Alpha, Sunna, and Day One. The group espoused a non-interference philosophy that allowed the artists to make their albums in the way they wanted.

The same year the Insects became unavailable for co-production and having parted ways with Nellee Hooper, the band were introduced to Neil Davidge, a relatively unknown producer who had an association with anonymous dance-pop outfit DNA. The first track they worked on was &quot;The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game&quot;, a cover version sung by Tracey Thorn for the &quot;Batman Forever&quot; soundtrack. Initially, Davidge was brought in as engineer, but soon became producer.

The group increasingly fractured in the lead-up to the third album, Davidge having to co-produce the three producers&#x27; ideas separately. Mushroom was reported to be unhappy with the degree of the post-punk direction in which 3D, increasingly filling the production vacuum, was taking the band.

In 1997, the group contributed to the film soundtrack of &quot;The Jackal&quot;, recording &quot;Superpredators (Metal Postcard)&quot;, a song containing a sample of Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; &quot;Mittageisen&quot; and &quot;Dissolved Girl&quot;, a new song with vocals by Sarah Jay (that was later remixed for the next album), which was featured at the beginning of the 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot;, although it was not on the official soundtrack.

Later that year they released a single, &quot;Risingson&quot;, from what would be their third album, &quot;Mezzanine&quot;.

===&quot;Mezzanine&quot;, &quot;Teardrop&quot;, Vowles&#x27;s departure and Marshall&#x27;s absence (1997–2001)===

In 1997, 3D became the band&#x27;s main producer in the recording sessions that made &quot;Mezzanine&quot;, Massive Attack&#x27;s most commercially successful album, selling nearly four million copies. It featured Neil Davidge as a sound engineer and co-producer, and Horace Andy and Elizabeth Fraser as the main guest vocalists. During recording, Angelo Bruschini became their permanent lead guitarist both in a session capacity and live.

The lead single, after &quot;Risingson&quot;, was &quot;Teardrop&quot;, sung by Fraser of Cocteau Twins. The song was accompanied by a video directed by Walter Stern, of an animatronic singing fetus. Horace Andy sang on three songs, including &quot;Angel&quot;. A track the band made for the film &quot;The Jackal,&quot; &quot;Dissolved Girl&quot;, sung by Sarah Jay, was remixed for inclusion on the record.

&quot;Mezzanine&quot; went on to win a Q Award for Best Album as well as being nominated for a Mercury Prize.

Touring extensively, friction between Mushroom and the other band members came to a head. Mushroom was unhappy with the direction of the group and having to appear on tour. In 1999, Mushroom left the band.

Around this time, 3D, with Davidge decamped into Ridge Farm studio with friends and band members of Lupine Howl (made up of former members of the band Spiritualized, including Damon Reece, who went on to be Massive Attack&#x27;s permanent session drummer and one of two live drummers) towards a fourth Massive Attack LP, taking things even further into a rock direction. 2001 also saw the release of &quot;Eleven Promos,&quot; a DVD of Massive Attack&#x27;s 11 music videos thus far, including &quot;Angel&quot;, a £100,000+ promo.

Despite having taken 3D&#x27;s side after Mushroom&#x27;s departure and participating in a webcast as a duo in 2000, Daddy G took a personal break from the band in 2001.

===&quot;100th Window&quot;, Marshall&#x27;s return and &quot;Collected&quot; (2002–2006)===
With Daddy G temporarily no longer involved in the studio, Davidge and 3D steered &quot;LP4&quot; on their own. Enlisting the vocals of Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Horace Andy, &quot;100th Window&quot; was mastered in August 2002 and released in February 2003. Featuring no samples or cover versions, &quot;100th Window&quot; was not as critically well received in Britain as the other records, although the album received a warmer reception internationally, scoring a 75 out of 100 on review aggregation site Metacritic. The group collaborated with Mos Def on the track &quot;I Against I&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;Special Cases&quot; single and the soundtrack for &quot;Blade II&quot;. &quot;I Against I&quot; is also notable as the only track from the &quot;100th Window&quot; sessions that features a writing credit from Daddy G. &quot;100th Window&quot; sold over one million copies and was toured extensively (including Queen Square, Bristol—a one-off sell out concert set up in the city centre park, which was seen as a homecoming).

Also in 2003, 3D was arrested on allegations involving child pornography, which were reported widely in the media. 3D was soon eliminated as a suspect (although he was charged with ecstasy possession and unable to get a U.S. visa for a while) with Daddy G and fans offering their support. The arrest affected the beginning of the &quot;100th Window&quot; tour schedule.

In 2005, 3D and Davidge agreed to an offer from director Louis Leterrier to score the entire soundtrack for &quot;Danny the Dog&quot;, starring Jet Li. Dot Allison, who had sung with the band on the &quot;100th Window&quot; tour, sang the end title track, &quot;Aftersun&quot;. 3D and Davidge also scored the soundtrack for the &quot;Bullet Boy&quot; film, with 3D on the end title vocals.

In 2005, Daddy G started coming into the studio, although little came of the material. He decided to instead work with a production duo, Robot Club, in another studio, feeling that he would be more free to develop tracks in the way he wanted. Meanwhile, 3D and Davidge recorded with a number of different singers as well as creating a track named &quot;Twilight&quot;, for UNKLE&#x27;s &quot;War Stories&quot; album. Later that year, Massive Attack decided to release their contractually obliged compilation album &quot;Collected&quot; in 2006. They released it with a second disc, made up of previously released non-album songs and unreleased sketches.

===&quot;Weather Underground&quot; / &quot;Heligoland&quot; (2007–2011)===

In 2007, 3D and Davidge scored three soundtracks, &quot;In Prison My Whole Life&quot; (which featured a track called &quot;Calling Mumia&quot; with vocals by American rapper Snoop Dogg), &quot;Battle in Seattle&quot; and &quot;Trouble the Water.&quot;

In February 2007, Massive Attack hosted a charity benefit for the Hoping Foundation, a charity for Palestinian children. In 2008, it was announced that Massive Attack were to curate the UK&#x27;s Southbank Meltdown, a week-long event. It was suggested in interviews that this event would inspire Massive Attack back into action, having spent several years drifting towards the completion of their fifth studio album.

Later that year, 3D and Daddy G headed to Damon Albarn&#x27;s studios for some writing and jamming. Around this time, Davidge scored the soundtrack for a Paul McGuigan film, &quot;Push&quot; and in December, 3D completed the score for &quot;44 Inch Chest&quot; with the Insects and Angelo Badalamenti.

Davidge and 3D got back together in 2009 with Daddy G to finish the fifth album, incorporating bits of the Albarn material. Later it was announced that the band were to headline the 2009 Bestival festival, and soon after that they were to tour the UK and Europe. In May, 3D&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Herculaneum&quot;, featured in the film &quot;Gomorra&quot;, won an Italian award for Best Song. Later that month, 3D and Daddy G picked up a special Ivor Novello award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

On 29 May 2009, Jonny Dollar died of cancer aged 45, survived by his wife and four children. Dollar was the programmer and hands-on producer behind &quot;Blue Lines&quot;, writing some of the melodies that were the basis for the string arrangements in &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot;.

On 25 August 2009 their new EP, &quot;Splitting the Atom,&quot; was announced. The other new tracks on the EP were Tunde Adebimpe&#x27;s &quot;Pray For Rain&quot;, Martina Topley-Bird&#x27;s &quot;Psyche&quot; and Guy Garvey&#x27;s &quot;Bulletproof Love&quot;. The latter two tracks appear as remixes of the album versions.

The fifth album was released on 12 November 2009, called &quot;Heligoland,&quot; after the German archipelago of Heligoland, after a previous project called &quot;Weather Underground&quot; was abandoned. 3D said &quot;I think it&#x27;s got definitely a more organic feel&quot;. The opening track, &quot;Pray For Rain&quot; featured guest vocals of TV on the Radio&#x27;s Tunde Adebimpe. Damon Albarn, Martina Topley-Bird and Mazzy Star frontwoman Hope Sandoval also provide guest vocals on the album. 3D said in October 2010, to the Spinner website, that his plans were now for &quot;unorthodox&quot; releases of several EPs in 2011, rather than an album.

===&quot;Ritual Spirit&quot; EP and working with Tricky again (2013–2019)===
In a 2013 interview for his first solo art show since 2008, 3D confirmed that not only was new Massive Attack material in the works, but that rumours of a reunion with Tricky were true. Tricky had not been featured on a Massive Attack album since 1994&#x27;s &quot;Protection.&quot;

On 5 February 2014, it was confirmed that Massive Attack would headline at Secret Solstice, a new music festival in Reykjavík in June. On 21 February 2015, it was confirmed through the Massive Attack Facebook page that they would be collaborating with Run the Jewels.

On 21 January 2016, the iPhone application &quot;Fantom&quot; was released. The application was developed by a team including 3D and let users hear parts of four new songs by remixing them in real time, using the phone&#x27;s location, movement, clock, heartbeat, and camera.

On 28 January 2016, Massive Attack released a new EP, &quot;Ritual Spirit&quot;, which includes the four songs released on Fantom. The EP was written and produced by 3D and new collaborator, Euan Dickinson.

It was their first release since the 2011 &quot;Four Walls / Paradise Circus&quot; collaboration with Burial, and the first time since 1994 that Tricky had been featured on Massive Attack content. Scottish hip-hop group Young Fathers, London rapper Roots Manuva and singer Azekel also featured on the EP.

On 26 July 2016, Massive Attack previewed three new songs: &quot;Come Near Me&quot;, &quot;The Spoils&quot;, and &quot;Dear Friend&quot; on the Fantom iPhone application on which they previously previewed the four songs from the &quot;Ritual Spirit&quot; EP.

On 29 July 2016, they released a new EP, &quot;The Spoils&quot;, which includes &quot;The Spoils&quot; and &quot;Come Near Me&quot;, both previewed on Fantom. The EP was written and produced by Daddy G, without 3D&#x27;s involvement. &quot;The Spoils&quot; features vocals from American singer-songwriter Hope Sandoval, and &quot;Come Near Me&quot; features British vocalist Ghostpoet. A music video for &quot;Come Near Me&quot;, directed by Ed Morris, and featuring Kosovan actress Arta Dobroshi, was released the same day as the single. The video for &quot;The Spoils&quot;, featuring Cate Blanchett and directed by Australian director John Hillcoat, was released on 9 August 2016.

On 13 July 2018, Massive Attack cancelled their appearance at the Mad Cool festival in Madrid because of sound bleed from Franz Ferdinand on a neighbouring stage. The festival offered several solutions to accommodate the band, but Massive Attack rejected them all.

In 2019, Massive Attack went on tour to promote the 20th anniversary rerelease of &quot;Mezzanine&quot;, billed as &quot;Mezzanine XX1&quot;. The American tour dates, originally scheduled for April, were postponed to September due to illness in the band.

===&quot;Eutopia&quot; EP and audiovisual releases (2020–present)===
In July 2020, Massive Attack released a political audiovisual EP called &quot;Eutopia&quot;. The three-track fusion was created across five cities during the COVID-19 global lockdown period, and was partly formed by generative algorithmic visuals from AI art pioneer Mario Klingemann and collaborations with Algiers, Young Fathers and US poet Saul Williams. The conceptual project, co-written and produced by 3D and documentary filmmaker Mark Donne, featured strong arguments for global system change from UN Paris Climate Agreement author Christiana Figueres, founder of the Universal Basic Income Principle Professor Guy Standing and inventor of the US &quot;Wealth Tax&quot; policy Professor Gabriel Zucman. Each video ends with a quote from Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot;.

Massive Attack were scheduled to headline the 2022 edition of the Primavera Sound music festival in Barcelona, Spain, but an unnamed band member&#x27;s serious illness forced the band to cancel its appearance with the rest of its European tour. Angelo Bruschini, who played guitar on &quot;Mezzanine&quot; and &quot;100th Window&quot; and had toured with the band since 1995, died of lung cancer on 23 October 2023.

The group played their first show in five years on 5 June 2024 in Gothenburg, Sweden, joined by guests Elizabeth Fraser, Horace Andy and Young Fathers, who all toured with the band during their European shows that summer. The same line-up played Bristol in August. Billed as a &#x27;Climate Action Accelerator&#x27; gig, the group worked with local businesses to reduce the event&#x27;s environmental impact. Around this time, Massive Attack announced their first American tour since 2019; again to feature Fraser, Andy and Young Fathers. However, on 11 October 2024, the group cancelled all the US dates less than a week before. They cited &quot;unforeseen circumstances&quot; as the reason.

In a December 2024 interview with &quot;NME&quot;, 3D revealed plans to release new music next year that had been ready since 2020 but was held up by record label disputes. He also said the band rejected an offer to play Coachella 2025 because of its environmental impact.

==Musical style==
Some of their most noted songs have been without choruses and have featured dramatically atmospheric dynamics. They use distorted guitar crescendos, lavish orchestral arrangements and prominent looped/shifting basslines. Underpinned by high and exacting production values, sometimes using copious digital editing and mixing. The pace of their music has often been slower than prevalent British dance music of the time. These and other psychedelic, soundtrack-like and DJist techniques, formed their style which has often been emulated. Journalists described this sound as &quot;trip hop&quot; from the mid-nineties onwards. In an interview in 2006, Daddy G said, &quot;We used to hate that terminology &quot;trip-hop&quot; so bad,&quot; [laughs] &quot;You know, as far we were concerned, Massive Attack music was unique, so to put it in a box was to pigeonhole it and to say, &#x27;Right, we know where you guys are coming from.&#x27;&quot;

==Other projects==
===&#x27;Fire Sale&#x27; exhibition===
A solo exhibition of Del Naja&#x27;s art was held at the Lazarides gallery in central London, from 24 May to 22 June 2013. The show&#x27;s content spanned a period of over twenty years and featured many of the art pieces that Del Naja created for Massive Attack. Each piece, reinterpreted especially for the exhibition, was hand-printed and finished. The show also featured three one-off &#x27;digital infinity mirrors&#x27;, two of which contained phrases supplied by Reprieve that were extracted from drone pilot dialogues. Del Naja performed a DJ set during the opening night on 23 May 2013.

===Massive Attack and Adam Curtis===
Del Naja conceived and designed an eight-night festival with filmmaker Adam Curtis—in collaboration with UVA (United Visual Artists)—that premiered in Manchester, UK in July 2013. The festival featured Curtis&#x27;s film, unofficially titled &quot;The Plan,&quot; which was projected on a huge screen surrounding the audience, while music from Massive Attack was interweaved throughout the film. Del Naja, who orchestrated the film&#x27;s soundtrack, described the experience as a &quot;collective hallucination&quot; and the film was also shown at the Manchester International Festival in July 2013. Music created by Del Naja for the festival became the score for a BBC production entitled &quot;HyperNormalisation&quot; in 2016.

In 2019, Del Naja and Adam Curtis teamed up for a second time on a live show based on the band&#x27;s Mezzanine album. The show challenged the idea of nostalgia and power, and featured machine learning GANS and deep fakes from Mario Klingemann, as well as new films from Curtis that were used to tell a narrative story. They were used as visuals for cover versions of non Massive Attack songs based on samples and loops that made up the album&#x27;s identity.

===Mezzanine DNA===
In April 2019, it was reported that Massive Attack had encoded &quot;Mezzanine&quot; into DNA to mark the 20th anniversary of the seminal 1998 album.
The album has also been made available in the form of a matte black spray paint can. A limited number of spray cans will contain the DNA encoded audio within matte black paint and each can will contain approximately one million copies of the album. Addressing the novel storage method, Del Naja – who is also known as a graffiti artist as &#x27;3D&#x27; – said: &quot;It’s a creative way to store your back catalogue, although DNA-encoded spray paint is unlikely to be adopted by street artists seeking anonymity&quot;.

==Activism and politics==

=== Anti-war advocacy ===
Robert Del Naja was critical of the policies of the UK government under Tony Blair. He was strongly opposed to the 2003 war against Iraq, and with fellow musician Damon Albarn personally paid for full-page advertisements against the war in the &quot;NME&quot; magazine.

Massive Attack have worked with Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Stop the War Coalition, while also having helped fund a legal challenge to military intervention in international courts.

=== Human rights ===
In 2008, Massive Attack curated the annual Meltdown festival on London&#x27;s South Bank. During the two weeks of live performance, cinema and art, they worked with human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith and his organisation Reprieve which uses the law to enforce the human rights of prisoners.

In 2010, the video shot by Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin for the song &quot;Saturday Come Slow&quot;, featuring Albarn, drew attention to the use of music in torture.

Massive Attack donated all proceeds from their 2010 EP &quot;Atlas Air&quot; to War Child, a charity the band previously supported when they contributed to &quot;The Help Album.&quot;

=== British politics ===
In 2007, Del Naja, musicians Albarn and Brian Eno, and United Visual Artists contributed to a Greenpeace demonstration against the renewal of the Trident nuclear programme that was held on board the Arctic Sunrise on the River Thames.

On 14 November 2012, on the eve of the Bristol Mayor election, the band caused some surprise by endorsing independent millionaire and former Liberal Democrat George Ferguson, citing the need for a mayor who would help facilitate creative projects to the city, and wasn&#x27;t simply following a party political agenda. Previously, Del Naja had openly criticised Ferguson for being a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers, an organisation dating back to the 16th century which had many connections with the Bristol slave trade. Del Naja endorsed Ferguson again in the 2016 election.

In September 2018, Massive Attack criticised the Mayor of Bristol for cancelling the Bristol Arena project in the Temple Meads area of Bristol. The Mayor had announced a private sector company, YTL would build a privately funded arena in Filton, a northern suburb of Bristol and the band announced they would not play there. Despite this, when a pop up arena was temporarily erected on the Filton site, Massive Attack played two gigs in March 2019.

In November 2019, along with other public figures, Massive Attack signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as &quot;a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world&quot; and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election.

In June 2024, Massive Attack endorsed and donated money to Carla Denyer, the co-leader of the Green Party, as MP for Bristol Central. They said &quot;General Election 2024 is an opportunity for #Bristol to consolidate its green reputation by electing an MP who is resolutely focused on #ClimateAction and unambiguous on the matter of genocide in #Gaza. @carla_denyer is that candidate.&quot;

=== International politics ===
Del Naja and Thom Yorke of Radiohead threw an unofficial party at the occupied UBS building in the city of London in December 2011, in support for the international Occupy movement.

During a concert in Istanbul in 2014, Massive Attack named those who died in anti-government protests at Gezi Park on the outdoor screen at their back with the following sentences: &quot;Their killers are still out there&quot; and &quot;We won&#x27;t forget Soma&quot;.

In June 2024, Massive Attack cancelled a concert at the Black Sea Arena in Tbilisi, originally scheduled for 28 July, in response to the Georgian government&#x27;s repression of the nationwide civil protests against law proposals that could have restricted freedom of press and LGBT rights in the country; in an official statement, the band explained their decision by writing quote, &quot;At this moment, performing at the state-owned Black Sea Arena could be seen as an endorsement of their violent crackdown against peaceful protests and civil society&quot;.

==== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ====
In late July 2014, Del Naja and Marshall visited the Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp in Lebanon to meet with Palestinian volunteers at an educational centre. The band&#x27;s profit from the show in Byblos was donated to the centre. In 2017, Massive Attack performed three shows in support of Hoping, an organisation that helps raise money and supports projects for Palestinian youth in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, Lebanon and Syria.

Massive Attack have previously played three shows in Israel, but have boycotted it since 1999 &quot;as a form of non-violent pressure on Israel to end its brutal occupation of Palestine&quot;. They have described their decision as &quot;not an action of aggression towards the Israeli people&quot;, but &quot;towards the [Israeli] government and its policies&quot;, arguing that &quot;the Palestinians [in Gaza and the West Bank] have no access to the same fundamental benefits that the Israelis do.&quot; In May 2020, Massive Attack co-signed an open letter urging Israel to end the blockade of the Gaza Strip.

In May 2024, the group publicly expressed their support to the music acts who had decided to boycott The Great Escape Festival in Brighton and Hove, in protest against the event&#x27;s sponsor Barclays and its investments in companies supplying arms that were reportedly used by Israeli military forces in their invasion of the Gaza Strip.

=== Decarbonisation project ===
On 28 November 2019, Robert Del Naja announced that Massive Attack partnered with a research centre based at the University of Manchester to explore the music industry&#x27;s climate impact. He wrote in a column in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;the commissioning of the renowned Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research to map the full carbon footprint of typical tour cycles, and to look specifically at the three key areas where CO2 emissions in our sector are generated.&quot; This will include information about band travel and production, audience transport and venue. &quot;The resulting roadmap to decarbonisation will be shared with other touring acts, promoters and festival/venue owners to assist swift and significant emissions reductions.&quot;

=== Environmentalism ===
In 2010, Massive Attack donated the income from a Lincoln car commercial to the clean up campaign after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Since October 2018, Massive Attack have also been supporting the climate activists of the Extinction Rebellion group, also known as XR, which conducted protests in London in October 2018 then April 2019. On 21 April, Massive Attack played a DJ set for the Extinction Rebellion protesters in the heart of London in Marble Arch. In July and October 2019, the group protested in 60 other cities worldwide, Robert Del Naja providing a portable radio network using speakers in backpacks with receivers and transmitters for the campaigners in London.

In 2021 the band published a report they had commissioned from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The report examined the impact of live music on the environment and gave a set of recommendations for meeting the Paris agreement targets. Del Naja criticised the UK government for not doing more to meet the targets. Massive Attack became the first band globally to commit their touring companies to the UN &quot;Race to Zero&quot; – Paris 1.5 compatible emissions reductions schedule.

The band played a Bristol show named &quot;Act 1.5&quot; on 24 August 2024 with the goal of being a &quot;large-scale climate action accelerator&quot;, blazing a &quot;trail for new standards of decarbonisation of live music.&quot; There were 25 different measures to minimise carbon, including giving extra benefits to local attendees and those travelling by train, powering the venue by renewable energy only, serving only plant-based foods and minimising waste through compostable plates and cutlery.

=== Other ===
In 2005, Massive Attack performed at a charity concert in Bristol for Tsunami relief with Adrian Utley and Geoff Barrow of Portishead. The two-night event featured Massive Attack, Portishead, Robert Plant, the Coral and Albarn. Massive Attack performed an intimate &quot;un-plugged&quot; set, and invited Fraser to reprise her lead vocals on &quot;Teardrop&quot;. The group collaborated with Portishead&#x27;s Beth Gibbons on the song &quot;Glory Box&quot; to end their set.

In March 2018, following the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal, Massive Attack suspended their Facebook page, stating: &quot;In light of Facebook’s continued disregard for your privacy, their lack of transparency and disregard for accountability – Massive Attack will be temporarily withdrawing.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Despite the band rejecting the label, &quot;Massive Attack&quot; are generally considered to be a pioneering act of the Bristol music scene and the trip hop genre, with some calling them the greatest trip hop band. Their debut album, &quot;Blue Lines&quot;, is generally considered to be the first album of the genre, even though the term was not coined until 1994. Both &quot;Blue Lines&quot; and &quot;Mezzanine&quot; are considered to be amongst the best albums of the 1990s and of all time.

In 1999, &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; was voted the 10th greatest song of all time in a poll by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

<text>The American Falls is the second largest of the three waterfalls that together are known as Niagara Falls on the Niagara River along the Canada–United States border. Unlike the much larger Horseshoe Falls, of which approximately 90% is in Ontario, Canada, and 10% in the U.S. state of New York, the American Falls is entirely within the United States.

==Characteristics==

The falls receive approximately 11% of the flow from Niagara River, with most of the rest going over Horseshoe Falls, from which it is separated by Goat Island. It has a straight-line crest width of about . If measured along the jagged lip of the falls, the crest is about long (but see coastline paradox). The torrent of water passing over the crest of the falls is about deep.

The height of the American Falls ranges between . This measurement is taken from the top of the Falls to top of the rock pile (talus). The height of the Falls from the top of the Falls to the river is .

Visitors can view the falls from a steep angle on the American side, where it is possible to approach to within several meters of the edge of the falls. One can view the falls from the bank of the river, as well as on Goat Island and Luna Island, which are accessible by a pedestrian bridge that crosses the rapids of the Niagara River upstream from the falls. The falls are viewable head-on from the Canadian side in Niagara Falls, Ontario.

The ledge of the American Falls is shaped in a modified &quot;W&quot; form, caused by numerous rock falls over the past 150 years which have resulted in the huge mound of rock at its base. The most notable recent rockfall occurred in 1954 with the collapse of Prospect Point to the north.

To survey the rockfall and determine how to prevent the falls from becoming a series of rapids, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers blocked the flow of water over the American Falls from June to November 1969. Results conflict as to whether tourist attendance that season was higher or lower than normal. Attendance increases were likely due to the news the cataract was dried off; decreases in tourists could be attributed to people believing both cataracts (the American and Horseshoe Falls) were dewatered. By December 1969, water was flowing over the American Falls again. In the mid‑1970s, it was decided not to make alterations to the rockwall, citing the trend to allow nature to take its course.

<doc id="74404" wikidata="Q5094517" url="?curid=74404" title="Chewco">
<text>Chewco Investments L. P. was a limited partnership associated with the Enron scandal, which resulted in the bankruptcy of Enron. It was named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca, because it was created to hide losses from the Joint Energy Development Investment Limited, known by its acronym &quot;JEDI&quot;. Like Chewbacca, the Jedi Knights were prominent characters in Star Wars.

Enron created Chewco as a limited partnership which would help keep the JEDI project off its books. It wanted to buy out the California Public Employees’ Retirement System’s interest in JEDI, but it did not want to be forced, by accepted accounting principles, to consolidate JEDI in the Enron financial statements and thus reflect debt and/or financial losses. Enron wanted to keep JEDI afloat, but it needed a partner to take at least a 3% stake, or the partnership&#x27;s results would have to be included in Enron&#x27;s financial statements. Chewco was created to be that partner.

The Chewco structure did not meet the SPE consolidation rules. The three basic rules for nonconsolidation of an SPE require that the independent equity investor—

* continuously invest at least 3% of the SPE’s assets;
* exercise control of and assume risks of the SPE; and
* like all other transactions, provide real (potential) economic benefits to Enron.

Chewco appeared to meet these tests, because it was financed by an unsecured loan from Barclays Bank; in reality, however, the loan had been guaranteed by Enron stock held by Enron itself. Additionally, as investors became more wary of Chewco, Michael Kopper, an Enron employee who reported to CFO Andrew Fastow, took over the titular management role and was used to hide actual ownership. With Enron thus assuming practical control over Chewco, the structure did not meet an additional requirement for a non-consolidated SPE. More prosaically, this was one of many ways in which Enron &quot;cooked the books&quot;, failing to disclose corporate debt that SEC regulations require to be disclosed.

Over the course of three years, Kopper received between $1.5 and $2 million in management fees from Chewco, some of which was kicked back to Fastow in the form of checks written to members of his family. According to the report of the investigative committee chaired by William Powers Jr., Kopper did little actual work, aside from time spent manipulating the books. Chewco itself did little actual work other than moving funds from one account to another, and that was done with minor expenditure of labor by lower-level employees. After all was said and done, Enron used Chewco to report roughly $400 million in nominal profits, while concealing $600 million in debt.

In November 2001, accountants Arthur Andersen discovered a two-page letter detailing a side deal in which Enron put up cash collateral to ostensibly give Chewco the outside equity it required for SPE status. As part of the deal, JEDI was to make a $6 million distribution to a reserve account in order to secure part of the loan from Barclays. As a result, Barclays no longer had the money at risk. Since Fastow had created Chewco with exactly three percent outside equity, the Barclays loan left Chewco at least $6 million short of the threshold.

Based on these discoveries, Andersen told former SEC enforcement chief Bill McLucas, who was leading the internal investigation into the matter, that Chewco and &quot;everything that touched Chewco&quot;–including JEDI–did not qualify for off-balance sheet treatment. As a result, Chewco and JEDI would have to be retroactively consolidated onto Enron&#x27;s books, forcing Enron to restate its earnings all the way back to 1997, the date of Chewco&#x27;s creation. It also emerged that Chewco would not have qualified as an SPE even if it met the equity requirement. Kopper was still employed at Enron at the time he took control of Chewco, and tried to disguise his role by putting his controlling stake in the hand of his domestic partner, Bill Dodson. The ensuing restatement was a primary catalyst for Enron&#x27;s bankruptcy in December.

<text>Cordelia is the innermost known moon of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on January 20, 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 7. It was not detected again until the Hubble Space Telescope observed it in 1997. Cordelia takes its name from the youngest daughter of Lear in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear.&quot; It is also designated Uranus VI.

Other than its orbit, size of 50 × 36 km, and geometric albedo of 0.06, virtually nothing is known about it. In the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; images, Cordelia appears as an elongated object with its major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of Cordelia&#x27;s prolate spheroid is .

Cordelia acts as the inner shepherd satellite for Uranus&#x27;s ε ring. Cordelia&#x27;s orbit is within Uranus&#x27;s synchronous orbit radius, and is therefore slowly decaying due to tidal deceleration.

Cordelia is very close to a 5:3 orbital resonance with Rosalind.

<text>Daria is an American adult animated sitcom television series created by Glenn Eichler and Susie Lewis Lynn. The series ran from March 3, 1997, to January 21, 2002, on MTV. It centers on the titular character, Daria Morgendorffer, an intelligent, cynical high school student, again voiced by Tracy Grandstaff, coming back from her role in Mike Judge&#x27;s earlier animated series, &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;.

It is a spin-off of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, in which Daria appeared as a recurring character. Although Judge allowed the character to star in a spin-off, he had no involvement in the production of &quot;Daria&quot; himself, as he was busy working on &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.

==Premise==
The series centers on Daria Morgendorffer (again voiced by Tracy Grandstaff, coming back from her role in &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;), a smart, acerbic, somewhat misanthropic/cynical teenage girl who, along with her best friend, aspiring artist Jane Lane, observes the world around her. The show is set in the fictional suburban American town of Lawndale, and is a satire of high school life, full of allusions to and criticisms of popular culture and social classes. As the show&#x27;s eponymous protagonist, Daria appears in most scenes with her immediate family (mother Helen, father Jake, and younger sister Quinn) and/or Jane. It is set during Daria&#x27;s high school days and ends with her graduation and acceptance into college. The principal location used for the show (outside of the Morgendorffer home) is Lawndale High School, a public-education institution filled with flamboyant and dysfunctional characters. The dynamics among the two lead characters changed during season four, when Jane began a relationship with Tom Sloane. Though Daria is hesitant to accept Tom at first, fearing she will lose her best friend, she and Tom find themselves becoming closer, culminating in a kiss in the season finale. The emotional and comedic turmoil among Jane, Tom, and Daria was the centerpiece of the TV movie &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot;, and the relationship between Tom and Daria fueled several of season five&#x27;s plotlines.

The plots of &quot;Daria&quot; largely concern a juxtaposition between the focal character&#x27;s blunted, sardonic cynicism and the values/preoccupations of her suburban American hometown of Lawndale. In a 2005 interview, series co-creator Glenn Eichler described the otherwise unspecified locale as &quot;a mid-Atlantic suburb, outside somewhere like Baltimore or Washington, D.C. They could have lived in Pennsylvania near the Main Line, though&quot;. For comedic and illustrative purposes, the show&#x27;s depiction of suburban American life was a deliberately exaggerated one. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the protagonist was described as &quot;a blend of Dorothy Parker, Fran Lebowitz, and Janeane Garofalo, wearing Carrie Donovan&#x27;s glasses. Daria Morgendorffer, 16 and cursed with a functioning brain, has the misfortune to see high school, her family, and her life for exactly what they are and the temerity to comment on it.&quot;

==History==
Daria Morgendorffer, the show&#x27;s titular character and protagonist, first appeared on MTV as a recurring character in Mike Judge&#x27;s &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. MTV senior vice president and creative director Abby Terkuhle explained that when that show &quot;became successful, we ... created Daria&#x27;s character because we wanted a smart female who could serve as the foil&quot;. Daria&#x27;s original design was created by Bill Peckmann while working for J.J. Sedelmaier Productions during Beavis and Butt-Head&#x27;s first season. During production of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;″s final seasons, MTV representatives, wanting to bring in a higher female demographic to the channel, approached story editor Glenn Eichler, offering a spin-off series for Daria. In 1995, a five-minute pilot, &quot;Sealed with a Kick&quot;, was created by Eichler and &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; staffer Susie Lewis (although written by Sam Johnson and Chris Marcil). Among 4 other animated pilots pitched to the channel, Daria performed the strongest in focus groups, especially among middle-school-aged participants - a fact that bothered MTV initially, as they felt their core audience at the time was instead 18- to 24-year-olds. But after show staff argued that college students don&#x27;t really watch much television, MTV approved a series order of 13 episodes; both Eichler and Lewis were signed onto the series as executive producers.

The first episode of &quot;Daria&quot; aired on March 3, 1997, roughly nine months before &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; ended its original run. Titled &quot;Esteemsters&quot;, the episode where established 16-year-old Texan Daria and her family&#x27;s move from fictional Highland, the setting of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, to the new series&#x27; equally fictional locale of Lawndale. As well as introducing Daria&#x27;s parents and younger sister, Quinn, as primary supporting characters, the first episode also introduced Jane Lane, Daria&#x27;s best friend and confidante. Other than a brief mention of Highland, &quot;Daria&quot; did not contain any references to &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;.

The series ran for five seasons, with 13 episodes each in five years, as well as two TV movies and two TV specials. The first movie, &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot;, aired on August 27, 2000, and took place between seasons four and five. MTV planned an abbreviated six-episode sixth season, but, at Eichler&#x27;s request, this project was cut down to a second movie, &quot;Is It College Yet?&quot;, which served as the series finale on January 21, 2002.

==Production==
No other characters from &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; appeared on &quot;Daria&quot;; the only direct reference to them was in promotions. Co-creator Glenn Eichler, in an interview conducted after the series&#x27; run, stated:

B&amp;B were very strong characters, with a very specific type of humor and very loyal fans, and of course they were instantly identifiable. I felt that referencing them in &quot;Daria&quot;, while we were trying to establish the new characters and the different type of humor, ran the risk of setting up false expectations and disappointment in the viewers – which could lead to a negative reaction to the new show and its different tone. So we steered clear of B&amp;B in the early going, and once the new show was established, there was really no need to harken back to the old one.

In the TV movie &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot;, several celebrities provided guest voices. MTV host Carson Daly played Quinn&#x27;s summer tutor, Canadian pop punk songstress Bif Naked played Jane&#x27;s art camp companion, and rock musician Dave Grohl played Jane&#x27;s pretentious art camp host. Several songs by the band Foo Fighters (in which Grohl is frontman) were featured in the series.

During &quot;Daria&#x27;s&quot; production, Grandstaff, Eichler, and Lewis had intentions of making a show where women appeared to be smarter and have it directed toward its female viewers, along with giving a voice to individuals who did not feel like they fit in. In contrast to audience belief, &quot;Daria&quot; had less planning and the show was left to develop more naturally, especially regarding the types of relationships the main character, Daria Morgendorffer, would have. In addition to this, the creators wanted to capture and represent what high school was like during the time the show was made, while portraying the different cliques typically seen in TV shows with a high school setting.

The first realization of how much the crew became attached to making &quot;Daria&quot; was after a five-minute pilot was created, showing how realistic the main character seemed despite being a digital creation. The animation style aided with production by having an uncomplicated form of filming that made the angles and movements appear natural. Lewis recalled letting the storyboards in the early stages of mapping &quot;Daria&quot; out aid on how the show would look with animation. Each episode was set to have a processing and completion time be nine months in order to fit making scripts, recording voice actors, and creating storyboards.

When describing why the show took longer than expected to be released on DVD after &quot;Daria&quot;″s debut, Eichler recalls: That’s how long it took to clear all the music rights. It also had a lot to do with MTV. Every time they began working on the rights, they had another loopy hit, so their small home-entertainment division had to put their resources on getting that show out. I guess we sort of got under the wire right before &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;! &quot;Daria&quot; saw a resurgence in viewership in 2020 once the show became available on streaming platforms such as Hulu, CBS All Access, and later Paramount+. However, neither &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot; nor &quot;Is It College Yet?&quot; became available on Paramount or MTV&#x27;s website, despite both films being crucial to the show&#x27;s plot progression.

==Episodes==
There have been 65 episodes of &quot;Daria&quot;, spanning five seasons, each with thirteen episodes. The series first went into production with an unfinished pilot episode, titled &quot;Sealed with a Kick&quot;. The first season was broadcast between March 3 and July 21, 1997, while season two was aired from February 16 to August 2, 1998; season three was shown from February 17 to August 18, 1999; season four from February 25 to August 2, 2000, and finally, season five between February 19 and June 25, 2001.

The series also includes two feature-length television films; the first, &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot;, which aired between seasons four and five, and chronicles the lives of the characters during summer break, and the second film, &quot;Is It College Yet?&quot;, which followed the fifth season, serving as the official finale to the series.

Two specials were also aired; &quot;Daria: Behind the Scenes&quot; was hosted by Janeane Garofalo and aired on February 18, 2000, one week prior to the season four premiere, and featured how the show was created, the making of the show, and the voices behind the characters. The second special, &quot;Look Back in Annoyance&quot;, aired on January 14, 2002, and is a retrospective hosted by Daria and Jane and highlights all the major events from the series before the lead-up to the television film finale, which was aired one week later.

==Music and licensing==
&quot;Daria&quot;&#x27;s theme song is &quot;You&#x27;re Standing on My Neck&quot;, written and performed by female rock group Splendora. The band later created original themes for the two &quot;Daria&quot; TV movies, &quot;Turn the Sun Down&quot; (for &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot;) and &quot;College Try (Gives Me Blisters)&quot; (for &quot;Is It College Yet?&quot;), along with some background music.

The show itself had no original score. Though elements from Splendora&#x27;s theme were used on occasion, &quot;Daria&quot;&#x27;s incidental music was taken from pop music songs. Most of these were contemporary, inserted over exterior shots and some scenes, with rarely any story relevance or awareness from the characters. For example, one episode depicts characters dancing to Will Smith&#x27;s &quot;Gettin&#x27; Jiggy wit It&quot; mere weeks after the song&#x27;s release, whereas the sequence itself was designed and animated months earlier.

Some story points were built around specific songs, such as in &quot;Legends of the Mall&quot;, where Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; became a major plot point for a fantasy sequence. The closing credits also featured a licensed song on all but a few occasions, the lyrics or concept of which often reflected some aspect of the preceding episode.

For the 1998 and 1999 VHS releases of some &quot;Daria&quot; episodes, incidental music was replaced, and &quot;You&#x27;re Standing on My Neck&quot; was only played over the closing credits. However, for the bonus episodes included on the DVD releases of the two TV movies, the music was removed almost entirely.

In the DVD release &quot;Daria: The Complete Series&quot;, creator Glenn Eichler mentions in the notes that &quot;99 percent of the music has been changed, because the cost of licensing the many music bites we used would have made it impossible to release the collection (and for many years did).&quot; He compared it to an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; where the astronaut comes home, and his wife can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s different about him, &quot;... until it dawns on her that instead of a cool song from 1997 playing ... it&#x27;s some tune she&#x27;s never heard. Yeah, it&#x27;s just like that.&quot;

The song &quot;Heart&#x27;s on Fire&quot; by 38 Special also enjoyed a brief comeback on some late 1990s radio stations because of the popularity of the series as well as the Amy Grant b-side hit &quot;I Love You&quot; (from her popular crossover album &quot;Unguarded&quot;), &quot;Silent Running&quot; by Mike and the Mechanics, and &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; by Mr. Mister.

==Reception==
&quot;Daria&quot; premiered to positive reviews, with John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing in March 1997, &quot;As far as MTV and &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; are concerned, &quot;Daria&quot; is an indispensable blast of fresh air.&quot; &quot;Daria&quot; continued to receive positive reviews during the course of its run and was one of MTV&#x27;s highest rated shows, with the network&#x27;s manager Van Toffler viewing the character as &quot;a good spokesperson for MTV, intelligent but subversive&quot;.

During the program&#x27;s run on MTV, Daria was part of the Cool Crap Auction, giving an overview of the goods for auction and talking &quot;live&quot; to the winner of one prize. Daria and Jane also hosted MTV&#x27;s &quot;Top Ten Animated Videos Countdown&quot;, poking fun at MTV&#x27;s cheap animation. At the end of the series run, she had an &quot;interview&quot; on the &quot;CBS Early Show&quot; with Jane Clayson. &quot;Daria&quot; received a ratings share between 1 and 2 percent, about 1 to 2 million viewers.

G.J. Donnelly of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, writing about the series&#x27; finale, lamented, &quot;I already miss that monotone. I already miss those boots. ... Even at its most far-fetched, this animated film approaches the teenage experience much more realistically than shows like &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;.&quot; On the same occasion, Emily Nussbaum wrote at &quot;Slate&quot; that &quot;the show is biting the dust without ever getting the credit it deserved: for social satire, witty writing, and most of all, for a truly original main character&quot;. She particularly singled out for praise that all the characters were heading &quot;to very different paths in life, based on their economic prospects,&quot; giving the show an ambiguous end; &quot;[the finale is] a bit of a classic: a sharply funny exploration of social class most teen films would render, well, cartoonish.&quot;

==Legacy==

In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Daria number 41 on its &quot;50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot; list. In December 2013, the newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; included Daria in its list of &quot;best female cartoon characters&quot;. In November 2018, IndieWire named &quot;Daria&quot; as the fourth-best animated series of all time. In December 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;Daria&quot; #91 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

In April 2017, in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the series, co-creator Susie Lewis and character designer Karen Disher were contacted by the &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine to reimagine the lives of the main characters 20 years after the events of the series. During that interview, Lewis admitted that she would &quot;love to bring Daria back to TV&quot;.

The 2021 studio album &quot;Dariacore&quot; by Jane Remover was named after the series as the artist was a fan of it. Screenshots of the series were used as album covers. The album and its sequels have given rise to a music microgenre that is also called Dariacore.

== &quot;Jodie&quot; television movie==

On June 21, 2018, it was announced that a revived series titled &quot;Daria &amp; Jodie&quot; was one of many revival projects in development at MTV Studios (later called MTV Entertainment Studios), a production studio which intends to sell new series to over-the-top media services. The title was later changed to &quot;Jodie&quot;. In May 2022, it was announced that &quot;Jodie&quot; would instead be an animated film that will air on Comedy Central and be animated by Awesome Inc. By March 2024, MTV Entertainment Studios dropped the film and indicated the producers may try to find a new studio to sell it to for distribution.

==Broadcast and home media==
&quot;Daria&quot; ran from March 3, 1997, to January 21, 2002, on MTV. In August 1, 2016 (coinciding MTV&#x27;s 35th anniversary of its original launch date), MTV&#x27;s new, rebranded, nostalgia-themed, music video-aimed sister channel (formerly known as &quot;VH1 Classic&quot;) aired reruns.

On May 28, 2002, Noggin (now as &quot;Nick Jr.&quot;) issued a press release stating that &quot;Daria&quot; (and the TV film &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot;) would begin airing as part of Noggin&#x27;s primetime block for teenagers, The N (now as &quot;TeenNick&quot;), in July 2002 for four years. The series&#x27; Noggin run began on July 2, 2002, and ended on June 17, 2006.

On October 21, 1997, Sony Music released &quot;Daria&quot; on VHS, and on August 31, 1999, it also released &quot;Daria: Disfranchised&quot; also on VHS.

In July 2004, co-creator Glenn Eichler said of possible DVD releases, &quot;There&#x27;s no distributor and no release date, but what there is very strong interest from MTV in putting &quot;Daria&quot; out, and steady activity toward making that a reality&quot;.

By July 2009, a DVD release for the series was planned for 2010. In January 2010, MTV released a teaser trailer on its website for &quot;Daria&quot;″s 2010 release. That May 11, &quot;Daria: The Complete Animated Series&quot; was released on DVD in North America by Paramount Home Entertainment. All 65 episodes and both TV movies are included in the set. Extras include the pilot episode, the music video &quot;Freakin&#x27; Friends&quot; by Mystik Spiral, &quot;Daria Day&quot; introductions as well as an animated top 10 music video countdown on MTV by Jane and Daria, cast and crew interviews, and a script for an unproduced Mystik Spiral spin-off show. The set, with all special features intact, was released on Region 4 PAL DVD on June 1, 2011. The Region 4 set was found to be encoded region free.

In June 2018, Hulu acquired rights to stream &quot;Daria&quot;. Because of Disney&#x27;s acquisition, the show was removed from Hulu at the end of September 2020 before it became available for streaming on CBS All Access (now known as Paramount+) from November 2020.

<text>Ophelia is a moon of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on January 20, 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 8. It was not seen again until the Hubble Space Telescope recovered it in 2003. Ophelia was named after the daughter of Polonius, Ophelia, in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;. It is also designated Uranus VII.

Other than its orbit, size of 54 × 38 km, and geometric albedo of 0.065, virtually nothing is known about it. In &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, images Ophelia appears as an elongated object, with its major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of the Ophelia&#x27;s prolate spheroid is 0.7 ± 0.3.

Ophelia acts as the outer shepherd satellite for Uranus&#x27;s ε ring. The orbit of Ophelia is within the synchronous orbit radius of Uranus, and is therefore slowly decaying due to tidal forces.

<text>: &quot;There is also an asteroid called 218 Bianca.&quot;
Bianca is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on January 23, 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 9. It was named after the sister of Katherine in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. It is also designated Uranus VIII.

Bianca belongs to the Portia group of satellites, which also includes Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda, and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Other than its orbit, size of 64 × 46 km, and geometric albedo of 0.08, virtually nothing is known about it.

In &quot;Voyager 2&quot; images Bianca appears as an elongated object, with its major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of the Bianca&#x27;s prolate spheroid is . Its surface is grey in color.

<doc id="74416" wikidata="Q719738" url="?curid=74416" title="Yarrow algorithm">
<text>The Yarrow algorithm is a family of cryptographic pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNG) devised by John Kelsey, Bruce Schneier, and Niels Ferguson and published in 1999. The Yarrow algorithm is explicitly unpatented, royalty-free, and open source; no license is required to use it. An improved design from Ferguson and Schneier, Fortuna, is described in their book, &quot;Practical Cryptography&quot;

Yarrow was used in FreeBSD, but is now superseded by Fortuna. Yarrow was also incorporated in iOS and macOS for their /dev/random devices, but Apple has switched to Fortuna since 2020 Q1.

==Name==
The name &quot;Yarrow&quot; alludes to the use of the yarrow plant in the random generating process of I Ching divination. Since the Xia dynasty ( to ), Chinese have used yarrow stalks for divination. Fortunetellers divide a set of 50 yarrow stalks into piles and use modular arithmetic recursively to generate two bits of random information
that have a non-uniform distribution.

==Principles==
Yarrow&#x27;s main design principles are: resistance to attacks, easy use by programmers with no cryptography background, and reusability of existing building blocks. The former widely used designs such as ANSI X9.17 and RSAREF 2.0 PRNG have loopholes that provide attack opportunities under some circumstances. Some of them are not designed with real-world attacks in mind. Yarrow also aims to provide easy integration, to enable system designers with little knowledge of PRNG functionality.

==Design==

===Components===
The design of Yarrow consists of four major components: an entropy accumulator, a reseed mechanism, a generation mechanism, and reseed control.

Yarrow accumulates entropy into two pools: the fast pool, which provides frequent reseeds of the key to keep the duration of key compromises as short as possible; the slow pool, which provides rare but conservative reseeds of the key. This makes sure that the reseed is secured even when the entropy estimates are very optimistic.

The reseed mechanism connects the entropy accumulator to the generating mechanism. Reseeding from the fast pool uses the current key and the hash of all inputs to the fast pool since startup to generate a new key; reseeding from the slow pool behaves similarly, except it also uses the hash of all inputs to the slow pool to generate a new key. Both of the reseedings reset the entropy estimation of the fast pool to zero, but the last one also sets the estimation of the slow pool to zero. The reseeding mechanism updates the key constantly, so that even if the key of pool information is known to the attacker before the reseed, they will be unknown to the attacker after the reseed.

The reseed control component is leveraging between frequent reseeding, which is desirable but might allow iterative guessing attacks, and infrequent reseeding, which compromises more information for an attacker who has the key. Yarrow uses the fast pool to reseed whenever the source passes some threshold values, and uses the slow pool to reseed whenever at least two of its sources pass some other threshold value. The specific threshold values are mentioned in the Yarrow-160 section.

===Design philosophy===
Yarrow assumes that enough entropy can be accumulated to ensure that the PRNG is in an unpredictable state. The designers accumulate entropy in the purpose of keeping the ability to recover the PRNG even when the key is compromised. Similar design philosophy is taken by RSAREF, DSA and ANSI X9.17 PRNGs.

===Yarrow-160===
The Yarrow uses two important algorithms: a one-way hash function and a block cipher. The specific description and properties are listed in the table below.
====Generation====

Yarrow-160 uses three-key Triple DES in counter mode to generate outputs. &#x27; is an &quot;n&quot;-bit counter value; &#x27; is the key. In order to generate the next output block, Yarrow follows the functions shown here.

Yarrow keeps count of the output block, because once the key is compromised, the leak of the old output before the compromised one can be stopped immediately. Once some system security parameter &#x27; is reached, the algorithm will generate &#x27; bits of PRNG output and use them as the new key. In Yarrow-160, the system security parameter is set to be &quot;10&quot;, which means &quot;&quot;. The parameter is intentionally set to be low to minimize the number of outputs that can be backtracked.

====Reseed====
The reseed mechanism of Yarrow-160 uses SHA-1 and Triple DES as the hash function and block cipher. The details steps are in the original paper.

====Implementation of Yarrow-160====
Yarrow-160 has been implemented in Java, and for FreeBSD. The examples can be found in &quot;An implementation of the Yarrow PRNG for FreeBSD&quot; by Mark R. V. Murray.

==Pros and cons of Yarrow==
===Pros===
*Yarrow reuses existing building blocks.
*Compared to previous PRNGs, Yarrow is reasonably efficient.
*Yarrow can be used by programmers with no cryptography background in a reasonably secure way. Yarrow is portable and precisely defined. The interface is simple and clear. These features somewhat decrease the chances of implementation errors.
*Yarrow was created using an attack-oriented design process.
*The entropy estimation of Yarrow is very conservative, thus preventing exhaustive search attacks. It is very common that PRNGs fail in real-world applications due to entropy overestimation and guessable starting points.
*The reseeding process of Yarrow is relatively computationally expensive, thus the cost of attempting to guess the PRNG&#x27;s key is higher.
*Yarrow uses functions to simplify the management of seed files, thus the files are constantly updated.
*To handle cryptanalytic attacks, Yarrow is designed to be based on a block cipher that is secured. The level of security of the generation mechanism depends on the block cipher.
*Yarrow tries to avoid data-dependent execution paths. This is done to prevent side-channel attacks such as timing attacks and power analysis. This is an improvement compared to earlier PRNGs, for example RSAREF 2.0 PRNG, that will completely fall apart once additional information about the internal operations are no longer secured.
*Yarrow uses cryptographic hash functions to process input samples, and then uses a secure update function to combine the samples with the existing key. This makes sure that the attacker cannot easily manipulate the input samples. PRNGs such as RSAREF 2.0 PRNG do not have the ability to resist this kind of chosen-input attack.
*Unlike ANSI X9.17 PRNG, Yarrow has the ability to recover from a key compromise. This means that even when the key is compromised, the attacker will not be able to predict future outputs forever. This is due to the reseeding mechanism of Yarrow.
*Yarrow has the entropy samples pool separated from the key, and only reseeds the key when the entropy pool content is completely unpredictable. This design prevents iterative guessing attacks, where an attacker with the key guesses the next sample and checks the result by observing the next output.

===Cons===
*Yarrow depends on SHA-1, a hash that has been broken (in terms of collision resistance) since Yarrow&#x27;s publication and is no longer considered secure. However, there is no published attack that uses SHA-1 collisions to undermine Yarrow&#x27;s randomness.
*Since the outputs of Yarrow are cryptographically derived, the systems that use those outputs can only be as secure as the generation mechanism itself. That means the attacker who can break the generation mechanism will easily break a system that depends on Yarrow&#x27;s outputs. This problem cannot be solved by increasing entropy accumulation.
*Yarrow requires entropy estimation, which is a very big challenge for implementations. It is hard to be sure how much entropy to collect before using it to reseed the PRNG. This problem is solved by Fortuna, an improvement of Yarrow. Fortuna has 32 pools to collect entropy and removed the entropy estimator completely.
*Yarrow&#x27;s strength is limited by the size of the key. For example, Yarrow-160 has an effective key size of 160 bits. If the security requires 256 bits, Yarrow-160 is not capable of doing the job.

<text>In linguistics, an alternation is the phenomenon of a morpheme exhibiting variation in its phonological realization. Each of the various realizations is called an alternant. The variation may be conditioned by the phonological, morphological, and/or syntactic environment in which the morpheme finds itself.

Alternations provide linguists with data that allow them to determine the allophones and allomorphs of a language&#x27;s phonemes and morphemes and to develop analyses determining the distribution of those allophones and allomorphs.

The term &quot;sound change&quot; refers to diachronic changes, which occur in a language&#x27;s sound system. On the other hand, &quot;alternation&quot; refers to changes that happen synchronically (within the language of an individual speaker, depending on the neighbouring sounds) and do not change the language&#x27;s underlying system.

==Phonologically conditioned alternation==
An example of a phonologically conditioned alternation is the English plural marker commonly spelled &quot;s&quot; or &quot;es&quot;. This morpheme is pronounced , , or , depending on the nature of the preceding sound.

# If the preceding sound is a sibilant consonant (one of ), or an affricate (one of ), the plural marker takes the form . Examples:
#*&quot;mass&quot; , plural &quot;masses&quot; 
#*&quot;fez&quot; , plural &quot;fezzes&quot; 
#*&quot;mesh&quot; , plural &quot;meshes&quot; 
#*&quot;mirage&quot; , plural &quot;mirages&quot; 
#*&quot;church&quot; , plural &quot;churches&quot; 
#*&quot;bridge&quot; , plural &quot;bridges&quot; 
# Otherwise, if the preceding sound is voiceless, the plural marker takes the likewise voiceless form . Examples:
#*&quot;mop&quot; , plural &quot;mops&quot; 
#*&quot;mat&quot; , plural &quot;mats&quot; 
#*&quot;pack&quot; , plural &quot;packs&quot; 
#*&quot;cough&quot; , plural &quot;coughs&quot; 
#*&quot;myth&quot; , plural &quot;myths&quot; 
# Otherwise, the preceding sound is voiced, and the plural marker takes the likewise voiced form .
#*&quot;dog&quot; , plural &quot;dogs&quot; 
#*&quot;glove&quot; , plural &quot;gloves&quot; 
#*&quot;ram&quot; , plural &quot;rams&quot; 
#*&quot;doll&quot; , plural &quot;dolls&quot; 
#*&quot;toe&quot; , plural &quot;toes&quot; 

==Alternation related to meaning==
===Morphologically conditioned alternation===
French has an example of morphologically conditioned alternation. The feminine form of many adjectives ends in a consonant sound that is missing in the masculine form. In spelling, the feminine ends in a silent e, while the masculine ends in a silent consonant letter:
*masculine , feminine 
*masculine , feminine 
*masculine , feminine 
*masculine , feminine 
*masculine , feminine 
*masculine , feminine 

===Syntactically conditioned alternation===
Syntactically conditioned alternations can be found in the Insular Celtic languages, where words undergo various initial consonant mutations depending on their syntactic position. For example, in Irish, an adjective undergoes lenition after a feminine singular noun:
*unmutated , mutated in 
In Welsh, a noun undergoes soft mutation when it is the direct object of a finite verb:
*unmutated &quot;bike&quot;, mutated in

<doc id="74423" wikidata="Q573712" url="?curid=74423" title="Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours">
<text>Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours ( , ; 14 December 1739 – 7 August 1817) was a French-American writer, economist, publisher and government official. During the French Revolution, he, his two sons and their families migrated to the United States.

His son Éleuthère Irénée du Pont was the founder of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. He was the patriarch and progenitor of one of the United States&#x27;s most successful and wealthiest business dynasties of the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Early life and family==

Pierre du Pont was born on 14 December 1739, the son of Samuel du Pont and Anne Alexandrine de Montchanin. His father was a watchmaker and French Protestant, or Huguenot. His mother was a descendant of an impoverished minor noble family from Burgundy.

Du Pont married Nicole-Charlotte Marie-Louise le Dée de Rencourt in 1766, also of a minor noble family. They had three sons: Victor Marie (1767–1827), a manufacturer and politician; Paul François (December 1769–January 1770); and Éleuthère Irénée (1771–1834), the founder of E.I. duPont de Nemours and Company in the United States. Nicole-Charlotte died 3 September 1784 of typhoid.

==&quot;Ancien Régime&quot;==
With a lively intelligence and high ambition, Pierre became estranged from his father, who wanted him to be a watchmaker. The younger man developed a wide range of acquaintances with access to the French court during the period. Eventually he became the protégé of Dr. François Quesnay, the personal physician of King Louis XV&#x27;s mistress, Madame de Pompadour. Quesnay was the leader of a faction known as the , a group of liberals at the court dedicated to economic and agricultural reforms. By the early 1760s, du Pont&#x27;s writings on the national economy had drawn the attention of intellectuals such as Voltaire and Turgot. His 1768 book on physiocracy () advocated low tariffs and free trade among nations, deeply influenced Adam Smith of Scotland.

In 1768, he took over from Nicolas Baudeau, editor of ; he published in volume 6.

He was invited in 1774 by King Stanisław August Poniatowski (Stanislaus II Augustus) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to help organize that country&#x27;s educational system. The appointment to the Commission of National Education, with which he worked for several months, helped push his career forward, bringing him an appointment within the French government.

He served as French inspector general of commerce under Louis XVI. He helped negotiate the treaty of 1783, by which Great Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States, and arranged the terms of a commercial treaty signed by France and England in 1786.

In 1784, he was ennobled by from Louis XVI (a process known as ), which added the (&#x27;of Nemours&#x27;) suffix to his name to reflect his residence.

==French Revolution==
Du Pont initially supported the French Revolution and served as president of the National Constituent Assembly.

He and his son Eleuthère were among those who physically defended Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette from a mob besieging the Tuileries Palace in Paris during the insurrection of 10 August 1792. Condemned to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror, du Pont was awaiting execution when Robespierre fell on 9 thermidor an IV (27 July 1794), and he was spared.

He married Françoise Robin on 5 vendémiaire an IV (27 September 1795). Robin was the daughter of Antoine Robin de Livet, a French aristocrat who lived in Lyon, and the widow of Pierre Poivre, the noted French administrator. After du Pont&#x27;s house was sacked by a mob during the events of 18 Fructidor V (4 September 1797), he, his sons and their families immigrated to the United States in 1799.

They hoped (but failed) to found a model community of French exiles. In the United States, du Pont developed strong ties with industry and government, in particular with Thomas Jefferson, with whom he had been acquainted since at least 1787 and who had referred to him as &quot;one of the very great men of the age&quot; and &quot;the ablest man in France.&quot;

Du Pont engaged in informal diplomacy between the United States and France during the reign of Napoleon. He was the originator of an idea that eventually became the Louisiana Purchase, as a way to avoid French troops landing in New Orleans, and possibly sparking armed conflict with U.S. forces. Eventually, he settled in the U.S. permanently; he died there in 1817.

His son Éleuthère, who had studied chemistry in France with Antoine Lavoisier, founded a gunpowder manufacturing plant, based on his experience in France as a chemist. It became one of the largest and most successful American corporations, known today as DuPont.

In 1800, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<text>: &quot;There is also an asteroid called 548 Kressida.&quot;
Cressida is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on 9 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 3. It was named after Cressida, the Trojan daughter of Calchas, a tragic heroine who appears in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (as well as in tales by Geoffrey Chaucer and others). It is also designated Uranus IX.

Cressida belongs to the Portia group of satellites, which includes Bianca, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda, and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Other than its orbit, size of 92 × 74 km, and geometric albedo of 0.08, virtually nothing is known about it.

In &quot;Voyager 2&quot; imagery Cressida appears as an elongated object, with its major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of Cressida&#x27;s prolate spheroid is 0.8 ± 0.3. Its surface is grey in color.

Cressida orbits close to a 3:2 resonance with the η ring, one of the rings of Uranus. Perturbations of the ring&#x27;s shape provide a way to measure the mass of Cressida, which in 2024 was found to be .

<text>Desdemona is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on 13 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 6. Desdemona is named after the wife of Othello in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot;. It is also designated Uranus X.

Desdemona belongs to Portia Group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda, and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Other than its orbit, size of 90 × 54 km, and geometric albedo of 0.08, virtually nothing is known about Desdemona.

In &quot;Voyager 2&quot; imagery, Desdemona appears as an elongated object, with its major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of Desdemona&#x27;s prolate spheroid is 0.6 ± 0.3. Its surface is grey in color.

Desdemona may collide with one of its neighboring moons Cressida or Juliet within the next 100 million years.

<text>: &quot;There is also an asteroid called 1285 Julietta.&quot;
Juliet is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 2. It is named after the heroine of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. It is also designated Uranus XI.

Juliet belongs to the Portia group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda, and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Other than its orbit, size of 150 × 74 km, and geometric albedo of 0.08, virtually nothing is known about Juliet.

In &quot;Voyager 2&quot; imagery, Juliet appears as an elongated object, with its major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of Juliet&#x27;s prolate spheroid is 0.5 ± 0.3, which is a rather extreme value. Its surface is grey in color.

Juliet may collide with Desdemona within the next 100 million years.

<doc id="74435" wikidata="Q242219" url="?curid=74435" title="Moana Pozzi">
<text>Anna Moana Rosa Pozzi (; 27 April 1961 – 15 September 1994), also known mononymously as Moana, was an Italian pornographic actress, television personality and politician.

==Early life==
Pozzi was born in Genoa, Italy, the daughter of Alfredo Pozzi, a nuclear engineer, and Rosanna, a housewife. Her name, Moana, is a Polynesian name meaning &quot;ocean&quot;. In her youth, Pozzi lived for periods of time in Canada and Brazil, due to the nature of her father&#x27;s work requiring him to travel. By the time she was thirteen years old, the family had returned to their native Italy, where she finished school. In 1979, a few weeks before her 18th birthday, she gave birth to her only child, a son named Simone, who was raised by her parents and told that his mother was his older sister. The family moved to France in 1980 and Pozzi, then 19 years old, decided to stay in Rome.

In Rome, Pozzi started working as a model and studied acting. Sometimes she performed in television advertisements or as a walk-on in comedy movies. In 1981, she performed in her first hardcore movie, &quot;Valentina, ragazza in calore&quot; (&quot;Valentina, Girl in Heat&quot;), credited as Linda Heveret. A minor scandal ensued since, at the same time the movie was in theatres, she was still working on a children&#x27;s television programme, , on Rete 2. She denied being the same person, but was suspended from television anyway. This gave Pozzi her first popularity in newspapers and magazines. In 1985, Federico Fellini wanted her to perform in his movie &quot;Ginger and Fred&quot;.
==Career==
Pozzi performed in about 100 porn movies, mostly in Italy, but also some in Los Angeles with Gerard Damiano as director. She sold about 1 million videotapes. She was on the covers of 50 major magazines, not including pictorials in porn magazines. She was reportedly worth more than lire50 billion (1990 prices), about 26 million euro.

==Death and aftermath==
In 1994, Pozzi fell ill, unable to eat without vomiting, and losing weight. She took time off from work to travel with her husband Antonio Di Ciesco to India and then to France. She died in Lyon, France, on 15 September 1994, at the age of 33, reportedly of liver cancer. The cause of her death has been a subject of debate, with numerous suggestions being made, ranging from Pozzi being a spy for the KGB, killed by exposure to radioactive polonium, to dying from the result of assisted suicide orchestrated by her husband. Some people have questioned whether or not Pozzi died, and believe she may have faked her death to escape fame. In 2006, over a decade after her death, the Italian crime show &quot;Chi l&#x27;ha visto?&quot; aired her death certificate which showed she had indeed died of liver cancer, along with her cremation certificate, showing her ashes had been given to family members. Despite the release of paperwork and interviews with family members, the public and media has continued to speculate on how or if Pozzi died.

In 2006, Simone Pozzi revealed to the public that he was her son, not her brother as he had been raised to believe. As told by him, he was born in 1979, just a few weeks before his mother&#x27;s 18th birthday, and was told growing up that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister, to avoid the scandal of an out-of-wedlock birth in the family. Pozzi&#x27;s mother confirmed the claims. Later that year, he, along with investigative journalist Francesca Parravicini, published a book about Pozzi&#x27;s personality, career and relationships.

==Legacy==
Pozzi was a popular and beloved figure in Italy and made a name for herself outside of the pornography industry. Following her death, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; remarked on the country being in mourning as the result of her passing and the Archbishop of Naples gave a homily in her honor. In fact, she considered herself Roman Catholic. During her lifetime, Pozzi supported LGBT rights, denounced the Mafia, and campaigned for legalization of sex work. Upon her death, she left much of her fortune to cancer research. Since she remains a well-known figure in Italy, the Walt Disney Company made the decision to release the animated film &quot;Moana&quot; as &quot;Oceania&quot; in Italy and changed the title character&#x27;s name to Vaiana for that localization.

Pozzi inspired the main character of the 1999 film &quot;Guardami&quot; (&quot;Look at Me&quot;).

In 2009 a miniseries based on her life was directed by and starred Violante Placido in the title role.

In 2010 her former manager Riccardo Schicchi produced and directed &quot;I segreti di Moana&quot; (&quot;The Secrets of Moana&quot;), in which the title role was played by Vittoria Risi.

<text>: &quot;There is also an asteroid called 900 Rosalinde.&quot;
Rosalind is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on 13 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 4. It was named after the daughter of the banished Duke in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;As You Like It&quot;. It is also designated Uranus XIII.

Rosalind belongs to Portia group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Juliet, Cupid, Belinda, and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Other than its orbit, radius of 36 km, and geometric albedo of 0.08, virtually nothing is known about Rosalind.

In &quot;Voyager 2&quot; imagery, Rosalind appears as an almost spherical object. The ratio of axes of Rosalind&#x27;s prolate spheroid is 0.8–1.0. Its surface is grey in color.

Rosalind is very close to a 3:5 orbital resonance with Cordelia.

<text>Michael Stanley Dukakis ( ; born November 3, 1933) is an American retired lawyer and politician who served as governor of Massachusetts from 1975 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1991. He is the longest-serving governor in Massachusetts history and only the second Greek-American governor in U.S. history, after Spiro Agnew. He was nominated by the Democratic Party for president in the 1988 election, losing to the Republican nominee, Vice President George H. W. Bush.

Born in Brookline, Massachusetts, to Greek immigrants, Dukakis attended Swarthmore College before enlisting in the United States Army. After graduating from Harvard Law School, he won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, serving from 1963 to 1971. He won the 1974 Massachusetts gubernatorial election but lost his 1978 bid for re-nomination to Edward J. King. He defeated King in the 1982 gubernatorial primary and served as governor from 1983 to 1991, presiding over a period of economic growth known as the &quot;Massachusetts Miracle&quot;.

Building on his popularity as governor, Dukakis sought the Democratic presidential nomination for the 1988 presidential election. He prevailed in the Democratic primaries and was formally nominated at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Dukakis chose Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his running mate, while the Republicans nominated a ticket of George H. W. Bush and Senator Dan Quayle. Dukakis made history as the first Greek-American and Aromanian presidential candidate, first Greek Orthodox major-party nominee, and the first major-party nominee with ancestry outside Europe. Although he lost the election, carrying only ten states and Washington, D.C., he improved on the Democratic performances in the previous two elections. After the election, Dukakis announced that he would not seek another term as governor, and he left office in 1991. Since the death of Jimmy Carter in 2024, Dukakis is the oldest living presidential nominee.

Since leaving office, Dukakis has served on the board of directors for Amtrak and taught political science at Northeastern University and UCLA. He was mentioned as a potential appointee to the Senate in 2009 to fill the vacancy caused by Ted Kennedy&#x27;s death, but Governor Deval Patrick chose Paul G. Kirk. In 2012, Dukakis backed the successful Senate campaign of Elizabeth Warren, whom he also supported in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

==Early life and education==
Dukakis was born in Brookline, Massachusetts. His father Panos (1896–1979) was a Greek immigrant from Edremit in Turkey. Panos Dukakis settled in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1912, and graduated from Harvard Medical School twelve years later, subsequently working as an obstetrician. Dukakis&#x27;s mother Euterpe (née Boukis; 1903–2003) was born in Larissa, to Aromanian parents from Vrysochori. She and her family emigrated to Haverhill, Massachusetts, in 1913.
Dukakis attended Brookline High School in his hometown, where he was an honor student and a member of the basketball, baseball, tennis, and cross-country teams. As a 17-year-old senior in high school, he ran the Boston Marathon. He graduated from Swarthmore College in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. Although Dukakis had been accepted into Harvard Law School, he chose to enlist in the United States Army. After basic training at Fort Dix and advanced individual training at Camp Gordon, he was assigned as radio operator to the 8020th Administrative Unit in Munsan, South Korea. The unit was a support group to the United Nations delegation of the Military Armistice Commission Dukakis served from 1955 to 1957. He then received his J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in 1960. Dukakis is also an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. Dukakis began his political career as an elected Town Meeting Member in the town of Brookline.

== State legislature ==
Dukakis served four terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives between 1962 and 1970. In 1966, Dukakis unsuccessfully ran for Attorney General of Massachusetts. In 1970, Dukakis was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor on a ticket led by Boston mayor Kevin White. However, the Democratic ticket lost the 1970 gubernatorial election. After losing his bid for lieutenant governor, Dukakis returned to the private sector, practicing law and becoming a partner at Hill and Barlow.

==Governor of Massachusetts==

=== 1974 election ===

=== First term ===

Dukakis was elected governor in 1974, defeating the incumbent Republican Francis Sargent during a period of fiscal crisis. Dukakis won in part by promising to be a &quot;reformer&quot; and pledging a &quot;lead pipe guarantee&quot; of no new taxes to balance the state budget. He would later reverse his position after taking office. He also pledged to dismantle the powerful Metropolitan District Commission (MDC), a bureaucratic enclave that served as home to hundreds of political patronage employees. The MDC managed state parks, reservoirs, and waterways, as well as the highways and roads abutting those waterways. In addition to its own police force, the MDC had its own maritime patrol force, and an enormous budget from the state, for which it provided minimal accounting. Dukakis&#x27;s efforts to dismantle the MDC failed in the legislature, where the MDC had many powerful supporters. As a result, the MDC would withhold its critical backing of Dukakis in the 1978 gubernatorial primary.

Governor Dukakis hosted President Gerald Ford and Britain&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth II during their visits to Boston in 1976 to commemorate the bicentennial of the United States. He gained some notice as the only politician in the state government who went to work during the Blizzard of 1978, during which he went to local TV studios in a sweater to announce emergency bulletins. Dukakis is also remembered for his 1977 exoneration of Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian anarchists whose trial sparked protests around the world. During his first term in office, Dukakis commuted the sentences of 21 first-degree murderers and 23 second-degree murderers.

His first term performance proved to be insufficient to offset a backlash against the state&#x27;s high sales and property tax rates, which turned out to be the predominant issue in the 1978 gubernatorial campaign. Dukakis, despite being the incumbent Democratic governor, was refused renomination by his own party. The state&#x27;s Democratic Party chose to support Director of the Massachusetts Port Authority Edward J. King in the primary, partly because King rode the wave against high property taxes, but more significantly because state Democratic Party leaders lost confidence in Dukakis&#x27;s ability to govern effectively. King also enjoyed the support of the power brokers at the MDC, who were unhappy with Dukakis&#x27;s attempts to dismantle their powerful bureaucracy. King also had support from state police and public employee unions. Dukakis suffered a scathing defeat in the primary, a disappointment that his wife Kitty called &quot;a public death&quot;.

===Cabinet===
===Between governorships===
Following his first governorship, Dukakis taught at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government. In 1980, Dukakis published his book &quot;State and Cities: The Massachusetts Experience&quot;.

===Second term===
Four years later, having made peace with the state Democratic Party, MDC, the state police and public employee unions, Dukakis defeated King in a re-match in the 1982 Democratic primary. He went on to defeat his Republican opponent, John Winthrop Sears, in the November election. Future United States Senator, 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, and US Secretary of State John Kerry was elected lieutenant governor on the same ballot with Dukakis, and served in the Dukakis administration from 1983 to 1985.

Dukakis served as governor during which time he presided over a high-tech boom and a period of prosperity in Massachusetts while simultaneously earning a reputation as a &#x27;technocrat&#x27;. The National Governors Association voted Dukakis the most effective governor in 1986. Residents of the city of Boston and its surrounding areas remember him for the improvements he made to Boston&#x27;s mass transit system, especially major renovations to the city&#x27;s trains and buses. He was known for riding the subway to work every day as governor.

In 1988, Dukakis and Rosabeth Moss Kanter, his economic adviser in the 1988 presidential elections, wrote a book entitled &quot;Creating the Future: the Massachusetts Comeback and Its Promise for America&quot;, an examination of the Massachusetts Miracle.

===Cabinet===
==1988 presidential campaign==

=== Primaries ===

Using the phenomenon termed the &quot;Massachusetts Miracle&quot; to promote his campaign, Dukakis sought the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States in the 1988 United States presidential election, prevailing over a primary field that included Jesse Jackson, Dick Gephardt, Paul Simon, Gary Hart, Joe Biden and Al Gore, among others. Composer John Williams wrote &quot;Fanfare for Michael Dukakis&quot; in 1988 at the request of Dukakis&#x27;s father-in-law, Harry Ellis Dickson. The piece was premiered under the baton of Dickson (then the Associate Conductor of the Boston Pops) at that year&#x27;s Democratic National Convention. Dukakis won the Democratic nomination, with 2,877 out of 4,105 delegates. He chose Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas to be his vice presidential running mate. Dukakis was pro-choice on the issue of abortion.

Dukakis made history as the first non-Western European American nominated for president by a major party, and was, until President Obama&#x27;s nomination in 2008, the only major presidential nominee in history with ancestry from outside Northwestern Europe. Every United States presidential nominee except for Martin van Buren (who was of entirely Dutch ancestry) has had ancestry from the British Isles. As the first ethnic Greek nominated for the Presidency by a major party, Dukakis enjoyed strong support among the Greek American community. The Associated Press reported in April 1988 that there was an &quot;outpouring of pride in Dukakis&quot;, which was especially strong and sentimental among older generations of Greek Americans. Dukakis stressed his working-class background as the son of impoverished immigrants, and his fluency in Greek among several other languages. Touching on his immigrant roots, Dukakis used Neil Diamond&#x27;s ode to immigrants, &quot;America&quot;, as the theme song for his campaign. This was seen as a sharp departure from his previous political campaigns in heavily white Massachusetts, in which the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that Dukakis rarely, if at all, made a point of his ethnicity (hence the reported colloquial saying &quot;I knew Michael Dukakis before he was Greek&quot;). Although George H.W Bush&#x27;s campaign did not make a point of it in their attack ads, researchers and pollsters often discussed the vulnerability of Dukakis embracing his heritage. Conservative analyst William Schneider Jr. said that Dukakis&#x27; Greekness was the &quot;great unspoken issue&quot; of the election. The &quot;Post&quot; assessed that Bush&#x27;s desirability as a WASP would inevitably make a victory more difficult for Dukakis in the long run.

Regardless of community support, Dukakis had trouble with the personality that he projected to the voting public. His reserved and stoic nature was easily interpreted to be a lack of passion; Dukakis was often referred to as &quot;Zorba the Clerk&quot;. Nevertheless, Dukakis is considered to have done well in the first presidential debate with George H.W. Bush, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporting, &quot;Democratic and Republican analysts generally agreed that Mr. Dukakis had turned in the better performance in the first of two Presidential debates, frequently managing to put Mr. Bush on the defensive.&quot; In the second debate, his performance was poor and played to his reputation as being cold.

During the campaign, Dukakis&#x27;s mental health became an issue when he refused to release his full medical history and there were, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;persistent suggestions&quot; that he had undergone psychiatric treatment in the past. The issue gained further traction after a White House press conference, during which President Ronald Reagan flippantly referred to Dukakis as an &quot;invalid&quot;. In the 2008 film &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot;, journalist Robert Novak revealed that Republican strategist Lee Atwater had personally tried to get him to spread these mental health rumors. Editors at &quot;The Washington Times&quot; contributed to these rumors when they ran a story headlined &quot;Dukakis Kin Hints at Sessions&quot;, suggesting that a member of the Dukakis family had said &quot;it is possible&quot; that Dukakis saw a psychiatrist. A week later the reporter, Gene Grabowski, revealed that &quot;Times&quot; editors had taken the full quote out of context. The full quote was &quot;It&#x27;s possible, but I doubt it.&quot;

Dukakis&#x27;s general election campaign was subject to several criticisms and gaffes on issues such as capital punishment, the pledge of allegiance in schools, and a photograph of Dukakis in a tank which was intended to portray him as a sound choice for commander-in-chief but which was widely perceived to have backfired. Like the allegations of psychiatric problems, these were vulnerabilities which Atwater identified and exploited. In 1991, shortly before his death from a brain tumor, Atwater apologized to Dukakis for the &quot;naked cruelty&quot; of the 1988 campaign.

===Crime===

During the campaign, Vice President George H. W. Bush, the Republican nominee, criticized Dukakis for his traditionally liberal positions on many issues, calling him a &quot;card-carrying member of the ACLU&quot;. Dukakis&#x27;s support for a prison furlough program was a major election subject. During his first term as governor, he had vetoed a bill that would have stopped furloughs for first-degree murderers. During his second term, that program resulted in the release of convicted murderer Willie Horton, who committed a rape and assault in Maryland after being furloughed. George H. W. Bush mentioned Horton by name in a speech in June 1988, and a conservative political action committee (PAC) affiliated with the Bush campaign, the National Security Political Action Committee, aired an ad entitled &quot;Weekend Passes&quot;, which used a mug shot image of Horton. The Bush campaign refused to repudiate the ad. It was followed by a separate Bush campaign ad, &quot;Revolving Door&quot;, criticizing Dukakis over the furlough program without mentioning Horton. The legislature canceled the program during Dukakis&#x27;s last term.

===Tank photograph===

Dukakis was criticized during the campaign for a perceived softness on defense issues, particularly the controversial &quot;Star Wars&quot; program, which he promised to weaken. In response to this, Dukakis orchestrated what would become the key image of his campaign, although it turned out quite differently from what he intended. On September 13, 1988, Dukakis visited the General Dynamics Land Systems plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, to take part in a photo op in an M1 Abrams tank. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher, had been photographed in 1986 riding in a Challenger tank while wearing a scarf, which turned out very successfully and helped in her 1987 reelection. General Dynamics protocol requires one to wear the protective helmet for safety and communication when the tank is running at full speed, although Dukakis campaign staffers were aware that a politician putting on any headgear was a faux pas. A member of the press did photograph Dukakis without the helmet when the tank exited the garage at a slow speed, but the rest of the photographers snapped shots of Dukakis wearing a helmet when the tank made a high speed pass.

The image of Dukakis wearing a helmet while riding the tank was ridiculed by Bush and the media. The following week, a poll found that 25 percent of respondents said they were less likely to support him because of the tank ride. Footage of Dukakis in the tank was used in a television ad by the Bush campaign which aired during the World Series. The Dukakis campaign produced a 60-second response ad that featured a television set playing Bush&#x27;s ad, which is flicked off the screen by a finger later revealed to be Dukakis as he proclaims that he is fed up with &quot;George Bush&#x27;s negative TV ads&quot;, but this &quot;pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey advertising&quot; only ended up drawing further attention to the tank ride.

The phrase &quot;Dukakis in the tank&quot; remains a shorthand for backfired public relations outings. In 2008, when asked about the photograph, Dukakis said &quot;Should I have been in the tank? Probably not, in retrospect. But these days when people ask me, &#x27;Did you get here in a tank?&#x27; I always respond by saying, &#x27;No, and I&#x27;ve never thrown up all over the Japanese prime minister&#x27;.&quot;

===Result===
The Dukakis/Bentsen ticket lost the election by a decisive margin in the Electoral College to George H. W. Bush and Dan Quayle, carrying only 10 states and the District of Columbia. Many believed he should have been campaigning across the country. During this time, his 17-point lead in opinion polls completely disappeared, as his lack of visibility allowed Bush to define the issues of the campaign. A large number of Democrats believed that the loss was to blame on Dukakis&#x27;s delayed response to Bush and underestimating Bush&#x27;s strength as a candidate. Dukakis has since stated that the main reason he lost was his decision &quot;not to respond to the Bush attack campaign, and in retrospect it was a pretty dumb decision.&quot;

Despite Dukakis&#x27;s loss, his performance was a marked improvement over the previous two Democratic efforts, both in the popular vote and the Electoral College. Though Bush still won a majority of the popular vote, Dukakis&#x27;s margin of loss (7.8%) nationally was narrower than Jimmy Carter&#x27;s in 1980 (9.7%) or Walter Mondale&#x27;s in 1984 (18.2%), and earned 41.8 million votes nationally.

Dukakis made some strong showings in states that had voted for Republicans Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. He managed to pull off a close win in New York, which at the time was the second largest state in terms of electoral votes; he also scored victories in Rhode Island, Hawaii, his home state of Massachusetts, Oregon, and Washington. Walter Mondale had lost all six states, and since then, all six states have remained in the Democratic column at presidential elections. He swept Iowa, winning by 10 points in a state that had voted Republican in the last five presidential elections. His proportion of the popular vote would not be matched by any subsequent Democratic presidential candidate in South Dakota (46.51%), Kansas (42.56%), Oklahoma (41.28%), Wyoming (38.01%), or Idaho (36.01%).

Although Dukakis cut into the Republican hold in the Midwest, he failed to dent the emerging GOP stronghold in the South that had been forming since the end of World War II with a temporary reprieve with Jimmy Carter (along with future President and Southern Democrat Bill Clinton, albeit to a much lesser extent). He lost most of the South by a wide margin, with Bush&#x27;s popular vote margins exceeding 15% in most states. He carried most of the southern-central parishes of Louisiana, which was also his best Southern popular vote margin. His second-lowest Southern margin was Texas, where four overwhelmingly Mexican-American counties of South Texas delivered more than 81% of the vote to Dukakis, and were among his top five counties or county-equivalents nationally.

In 2008, Dukakis stated during an interview with Katie Couric that he &quot;owe[d] the American people an apology&quot; because &quot;if I had beaten the old man [i.e. George H. W. Bush], we never would have heard of the kid [i.e. George W. Bush], and we wouldn&#x27;t be in this mess.&quot;

==Post-1988 political career==


His final two years as governor were marked by increased criticism of his policies and significant tax increases to cover the economic effects of the U.S. economy&#x27;s &quot;soft landing&quot; at the end of the 1980s and the recession of 1990. He announced in early 1989 that he would not seek reelection to a fourth term.

After the end of his term, he served on the board of directors for Amtrak, and became a professor of political science at Northeastern University, a visiting professor of political science at Loyola Marymount University, and visiting professor in the Department of Public Policy at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at UCLA. He had retired from his teaching roles by 2021. Along with a number of other notable Greek-Americans, he is a founding member of The Next Generation Initiative: a leadership program aimed at getting students involved in public affairs. In November 2008, Northeastern named its Center for Urban and Regional Policy after Michael Dukakis and his wife Kitty. Dukakis is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. Dukakis retired from Northeastern at age 90 in 2024. &quot;Dukakis: Recipe for Democracy&quot;, a documentary film about Dukakis&#x27;s life as professor at Northeastern, premiered on October 22, 2024.

In August 2009, the 75-year-old Dukakis was mentioned as one of two leading candidates as a possible interim successor to Ted Kennedy in the U.S. Senate, after Kennedy&#x27;s death. Instead, Gov. Patrick named Paul G. Kirk, the other leading candidate and favorite of the Kennedy family who promised not to run in the special election, to fill the seat.

Dukakis has also been an advocate for effective public transportation and high-speed rail as a solution to automobile congestion and the lack of space at airports; and for extended learning time initiative in public schools.

Dukakis stated on January 31, 2014, that he was not in favor of an effort to rename South Station as the &quot;Gov. Michael S. Dukakis Transportation Center&quot;, although it was later renamed to that name. He went on to state that he would not object to the naming of the as-yet unbuilt North-South Rail Link after him.

In 2012, Dukakis worked to support the successful candidacy of fellow Democrat Elizabeth Warren to the U.S. Senate. During the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Dukakis endorsed the campaign of Hillary Clinton. Dukakis endorsed Setti Warren&#x27;s unsuccessful 2018 candidacy for the Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Dukakis endorsed Elizabeth Warren&#x27;s candidacy in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He later endorsed Democratic nominee, Joe Biden during the general election. He and his wife also endorsed Ed Markey for reelection to his Massachusetts U.S. senate seat in 2020 during both the primary and general elections.

==Electoral history==


















==Family==
Dukakis is married to Katharine D. (Kitty) Dukakis. They have three children: John, Andrea, and Kara. John is the issue of Kitty&#x27;s first marriage, to Phoenix businessman John Chaffetz (who later fathered former Congressman Jason Chaffetz); Michael Dukakis adopted John, Jr.

During the second presidential debate on October 13, 1988, in Los Angeles, Dukakis revealed that he and his wife had had another child, who died about 20 minutes after birth. Dukakis is the cousin of Academy Award–winning actress Olympia Dukakis. In 1988, they shared that they attend both Greek Orthodox and Jewish worship services out of respect for both of the spouses&#x27; faiths.

The Dukakises continue to reside in the home that they bought in the early 1970s in Brookline, Massachusetts, where they both grew up. However, they have also maintained a home in Los Angeles during the winters, when he taught at UCLA.

Belinda is an inner satellite of the planet Uranus. Belinda was discovered from the images taken by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on 13 January 1986 and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 5. It is named after the heroine of Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;. It is also designated Uranus XIV.

Belinda belongs to the Portia group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Juliet, Cupid, Rosalind, and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Other than its orbit, size of 128 × 64 km, and geometric albedo of 0.08, virtually nothing is known about it.

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; images show Belinda as an elongated object with its major axis pointing towards Uranus. The moon is very elongated, with its short axis 0.5 ± 0.1 times the long axis. Its surface is grey in color.

Belinda is in a stable 44:43 mean-motion resonance with Perdita, and from this its mass has been determined to be roughly 26 times that of Perdita.

The inner moon system is unstable over timescales of several millions of years. Belinda and Cupid will probably be the first pair of moons to collide, in 100,000 to 10 million years&#x27; time depending on the densities of the Portia-group satellites, due to resonant interactions with the much smaller Cupid.

<text>Joseph Isadore Lieberman (; February 24, 1942 – March 27, 2024) was an American politician and lawyer who served as a United States senator from Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. A former member of the Democratic Party, he was its nominee for vice president of the United States in the 2000 U.S. presidential election. During his final term in office, he was officially listed as an Independent Democrat and caucused with and chaired committees for the Democratic Party.

Lieberman was elected as a Democrat in 1970 to the Connecticut Senate, where he served three terms as majority leader. After an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980, he served as the Connecticut attorney general from 1983 to 1989. He narrowly defeated Republican Party incumbent Lowell Weicker in 1988 to win election to the U.S. Senate and was re-elected in 1994, 2000, and 2006. He was the Democratic Party nominee for vice president in the 2000 presidential election, running with presidential nominee and then Vice President Al Gore, and becoming the first Jewish candidate on a U.S. major party presidential ticket.

In the 2000 presidential election, Gore and Lieberman won the popular vote by a margin of more than 500,000 votes but lost the deciding Electoral College to the Republican George W. Bush–Dick Cheney ticket 271–266. He also unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. During his Senate re-election bid in 2006, Lieberman lost the Democratic primary election but won re-election in the general election as a third party candidate under the Connecticut for Lieberman party label.

Lieberman was officially listed in Senate records for the 110th and 111th Congress as an Independent Democrat, and sat as part of the Senate Democratic Caucus. After his speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention in which he endorsed John McCain for president, he no longer attended Democratic Caucus leadership strategy meetings or policy lunches. The Senate Democratic Caucus voted to allow him to keep the chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Subsequently, he announced that he would continue to caucus with the Democrats. Before the 2016 election, he endorsed Hillary Clinton for president and in 2020 endorsed Joe Biden for president.

As senator, Lieberman introduced and championed the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010 and legislation that led to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. During debate on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as the crucial 60th vote needed to pass the legislation, his opposition to the public health insurance option was critical to its removal from the resulting bill signed by President Barack Obama.

==Early life==
Lieberman was born on February 24, 1942, in Stamford, Connecticut, the son of Henry, who ran a liquor store, and Marcia () Lieberman. His family is Jewish; his paternal grandparents emigrated from Congress Poland and his maternal grandparents were from Austria-Hungary.

In 1963, Lieberman traveled to Mississippi to work in support of the civil rights movement. He received a Bachelor of Arts in both political science and economics from Yale University in 1964, and was the first member of his family to attend college. At Yale, he was editor of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; and a member of the Elihu Club. While at Yale Lieberman was introduced to conservative thinker William F. Buckley Jr., who was also editor of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;; Buckley and Lieberman maintained a social relationship. His roommate was Richard Sugarman, who later went on to become a Professor of Philosophy and Religion at the University of Vermont and advisor to 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Lieberman later attended Yale Law School, receiving his Bachelor of Laws in 1967. After graduation from law school, Lieberman worked as a lawyer for the New Haven-based law firm Wiggin &amp; Dana LLP.

Lieberman received an educational deferment from the Vietnam War draft when he was an undergraduate and law student from 1960 to 1967. Upon graduating from law school at age 25, Lieberman qualified for a family deferment because he was already married and had a child.

==Early political career==

Lieberman was elected to the Connecticut Senate in 1970, where he served for 10 years, including the last six as Majority Leader. He suffered his first defeat in Connecticut elections in the Reagan landslide year of 1980, losing the race for the third district congressional seat to Republican Lawrence Joseph DeNardis, a state senator from suburban Hamden with whom he had worked closely on bipartisan legislative efforts. In 1981 he wrote an admiring biography of long-time Connecticut and national Democratic leader John Moran Bailey, reviewing also in the book the previous 50 years of Connecticut political history.

From 1983 to 1989, Lieberman served as Connecticut Attorney General. He argued one case before the United States Supreme Court, &quot;Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc.&quot;, a free exercise case involving Connecticut&#x27;s repeal of its blue laws. In the 1986 general election, Lieberman won more votes than any other Democrat on the statewide ticket, including Governor William O&#x27;Neill. As Attorney General, Lieberman emphasized consumer protection and environmental enforcement.

==U.S. Senate==

===Tenure===
Lieberman was first elected to the United States Senate as a Democrat in the 1988 election, defeating liberal Republican Lowell Weicker by a margin of 10,000 votes. He scored the nation&#x27;s biggest political upset that year, after being backed by a coalition of Democrats and unaffiliated voters with support from conservative Republicans, most notably including &quot;National Review&quot; founder and &quot;Firing Line&quot; host William F. Buckley Jr. and his brother, former New York Senator James L. Buckley, who were disappointed in three-term Republican incumbent Weicker&#x27;s liberal voting record and personal style. During the campaign, he received support from Connecticut&#x27;s Cuban American community, which was unhappy with Weicker. Thereafter, Lieberman remained firmly anti-Castro.

Shortly after his first election to the Senate, Lieberman was approached by George J. Mitchell, the incoming Majority Leader who advised him, &quot;Pick out two or three areas that you&#x27;re really interested in and learn them so that your colleagues know what you&#x27;re talking about ... You&#x27;re going to have more influence even as a freshman than you think because you know there&#x27;s hundreds of issues and inevitably we rely on each other.&quot; Recalling the conversation, Lieberman said &quot;that was true when I first came in, although you could see partisanship beginning to eat away at that. But at the end of my 24 years, it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to 60 votes to break a filibuster to get things done.&quot;

Lieberman&#x27;s initiatives against violence in video games are considered the chief impetus behind the establishment of an industry-wide video game rating system during the early 1990s.

In 1994, Lieberman made history by winning by the largest landslide ever in a Connecticut Senate race, drawing 67 percent of the vote and beating his opponent by more than 350,000 votes. Lieberman then served as chair of the Democratic Leadership Council from 1995 to 2001. In 1998, Lieberman was the first prominent Democrat to publicly challenge Clinton for the judgment exercised in his affair with Monica Lewinsky; however, he voted against removing Clinton from office by impeachment. Of his criticism of Bill Clinton, Lieberman said in 2014:

It was a very hard thing for me to do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn&#x27;t say something, I&#x27;d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if somebody who was supportive of him didn&#x27;t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying that he was going to express an opinion which wasn&#x27;t universally held at the White House – he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I&#x27;m at home and the phone rings, it&#x27;s the White House. And it&#x27;s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, &quot;I just want you to know that there&#x27;s nothing you said in that speech that I don&#x27;t agree with. And I want you to know that I&#x27;m working on it.&quot; And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.

In 2000, Lieberman was elected to a third Senate term, defeating the Republican candidate, Philip Giordano.

=== Vice presidential campaign ===
Lieberman&#x27;s 2000 Senate campaign was concurrent with that year&#x27;s presidential election. In August 2000, Vice President Al Gore announced that he had selected Lieberman as his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman became the first practicing Jew to run for the nation&#x27;s second-highest office. Lieberman was selected from a group of potential running mates that reportedly included Senators John Kerry and John Edwards, the team that would form the Democratic presidential ticket four years later.

Lieberman had a reputation of being a more ideologically conservative Democrat than Gore. Because of Lieberman&#x27;s criticism of Clinton&#x27;s personal behavior, some viewed Gore&#x27;s choice of Lieberman as a way to distance himself from the scandals of the Clinton White House. The Gore–Lieberman ticket was defeated in a hard-fought election that was contested for weeks after the vote. On December 12, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling brought the race to an official end, confirming the decision in the favor of the Bush-Cheney ticket.

===2006 Senate election===

====Primary====

Lieberman sought the Democratic Party&#x27;s renomination for U.S. Senate from Connecticut in 2006 but lost to the comparatively more liberal Ned Lamont, a Greenwich businessman and antiwar candidate. Lamont received 33 percent of the delegates&#x27; votes at the Connecticut Democratic Convention in May, forcing an August primary.

In July, Lieberman announced that he would file papers to appear on the November ballot should he lose the primary, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m a loyal Democrat, but I have loyalties that are greater than those to my party, and that&#x27;s my loyalty to my state and my country.&quot; He said he would continue to sit as a Democrat in the Senate even if he was defeated in the primary and elected on an unaffiliated line, and expressed concern for a potentially low turnout. On July 10, the Lieberman campaign officially filed paperwork allowing him to collect signatures for the newly formed Connecticut for Lieberman party ballot line.

On August 8, 2006, Lieberman conceded the Democratic primary election to Ned Lamont, saying, &quot;For the sake of our state, our country and my party, I cannot and will not let that result stand,&quot; and announced he would run in the 2006 November election as an independent candidate on the Connecticut for Lieberman ticket, against both Lamont and the Republican candidate, Alan Schlesinger.

====General election====

Polls after the primary showed Lieberman leading by varying margins. Alan Schlesinger barely registered support, and his campaign had run into problems based on alleged gambling debts. According to columnist Steve Kornacki, Lieberman was therefore &quot;able to run in the general election as the de facto Republican candidate – every major Republican office-holder in the state endorsed him – and to supplement that GOP base with strong support from independents.&quot;

On August 9, 2006, Hillary Clinton, the junior U.S. senator from New York, affirmed her pledge to support the primary winner, saying &quot;voters of Connecticut have made their decision and I think that decision should be respected&quot;, and Howard Dean called for Lieberman to quit the race, saying he was being &quot;disrespectful of Democrats and disrespectful of the Democratic Party&quot;. On August 10, in his first campaign appearance since losing the Democratic primary, referencing the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, Lieberman criticized Lamont, saying: &quot;If we just pick up like Ned Lamont wants us to do, get out [of Iraq] by a date certain, it will be taken as a tremendous victory by the same people who wanted to blow up these planes in this plot hatched in England. It will strengthen them and they will strike again.&quot; Lamont noted Lieberman&#x27;s position was similar to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney&#x27;s position. Lamont said, &quot;That comment sounds an awful lot like Vice President Cheney&#x27;s comment on Wednesday. Both of them believe our invasion of Iraq has a lot to do with 9/11. That&#x27;s a false premise.&quot; Lieberman&#x27;s communications director replied that Lamont was politicizing national security by &quot;portraying [Lieberman] as a soul mate of President Bush on Iraq&quot;.

As a Democrat, Lieberman earned an inordinate amount of support from some prominent conservatives in American politics. On August 17, 2006, the National Republican Senatorial Committee stated that they would favor a Lieberman victory in the November election over Democratic nominee Ned Lamont; however, the NRSC stated that they were not going so far as to actually support Lieberman. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani praised Lieberman at a South Carolina campaign stop on August 18, saying he was &quot;a really exceptional senator&quot;. Five Democratic senators maintained their support for Lieberman, and Lieberman also received the strong support of former senator and Democratic stalwart Bob Kerrey, who offered to stump for him. Democratic minority leader Harry Reid, while endorsing Lamont, promised Lieberman that he would retain his committee positions and seniority if he prevailed in the general election. On August 28, Lieberman campaigned at the same motorcycle rally as Republican Congressman Christopher Shays. Shays told a crowd of motorcycle enthusiasts, &quot;We have a national treasure in Joe Lieberman.&quot; Mel Sembler, a former Republican National Committee finance chairman, helped organize a reception that raised a &quot;couple hundred thousand dollars&quot; for Lieberman, who was personally in attendance. Sembler is a prominent Republican who chaired I. Lewis &#x27;Scooter&#x27; Libby&#x27;s legal defense fund. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg held a fundraiser for Lieberman at his home in November, co-hosted by former mayor Ed Koch and former Senator Alfonse M. D&#x27;Amato. Koch called Lieberman &quot;one of the greatest Senators we&#x27;ve ever had in the Senate.&quot;

Despite still considering himself a Democrat, Lieberman was endorsed by numerous Republicans who actively spoke out in favor of his candidacy. Lieberman was also the focus of websites such as ConservativesforLieberman06.com. On November 7, Lieberman won re-election with 50% of the vote. Ned Lamont garnered 40% of ballots cast and Alan Schlesinger won 10%. Lieberman received support from 33% of Democrats, 54% of independents and 70% of Republicans.

===Creation of Department of Homeland Security (DHS)===
When control of the Senate switched from Republicans to Democrats in June 2001, Lieberman became Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, with oversight responsibilities for a broad range of government activities. He was also a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and chair of its Subcommittee Clean Air, Wetlands and Private Property; the Armed Services Committee, where he chaired the Airland Subcommittee and sat on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities; and the Small Business Committee. When Republicans gained control of the Senate in January 2003, Lieberman resumed his role as ranking minority member of the committees he had once chaired.

Lieberman was an early supporter of the creation of the Department of Homeland Security as the chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, proposing organizing FEMA, the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Coast Guard, and other agencies under the new department. This proposal was eventually implemented in the Homeland Security Act of 2002.

In 2006, Senators Lieberman and Collins drafted legislation to reshape the Federal Emergency Management Agency into an agency that would more effectively prepare for and respond to catastrophes, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. The legislation elevated FEMA to special status within the Department of Homeland Security, much like the Coast Guard and designated FEMA&#x27;s head to be the president&#x27;s point person during an emergency. The bill also called for the reunification of FEMA&#x27;s preparedness and response functions, giving it responsibility for all phases of emergency management. In addition, the measure strengthened FEMA&#x27;s regional offices, creating dedicated interagency &quot;strike teams&quot; to provide the initial federal response to a disaster in the region. The legislation passed Congress in September 2006.

As the 2007 hurricane season approached, Lieberman held an oversight hearing on implementation of the FEMA reforms on May 22, 2007. He urged FEMA to implement the reforms at a quicker pace. Lieberman was also involved in congressional oversight of the response to the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) pandemic and held four hearings on the subject in 2009, including one in Connecticut. At the hearings, he pressed the United States Department of Health and Human Services to distribute vaccines and antiviral medications at a quicker pace and to streamline the process. In the 110th Congress, Lieberman was Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is responsible for assuring the Federal Government&#x27;s efficiency and effectiveness. He was also a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee; Senate Armed Services Committee, where he was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Air Land Forces and sat on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities; and the Small Business Committee.

===Fundraising===
From 1989 onwards, Lieberman received more than $31.4 million in campaign donations from specific industries and sectors. His largest donors represented the securities and investment ($3.7 million), legal ($3.6 million), real estate ($3.1 million), and health professional ($1.1 million) industries.

===Committee assignments===

* Committee on Armed Services
** Subcommittee on Airland (Chairman)
** Subcommittee on Personnel
** Subcommittee on SeaPower
* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (Chairman)
* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship
* Committee on Environment and Public Works
** Subcommittee on Private Sector and Consumer Solutions to Global Warming (Chairman)

===Caucus memberships===
* Senate Caucus on Global Internet Freedom
* Congressional Fire Services Caucus (Co-Chair)
* Congressional Public Service Caucus (Co-Chair)
* International Conservation Caucus

==Presidential election involvement==

===2000===

In August 2000, Lieberman was selected as the nominee for Vice President of the United States by Al Gore, the Democratic Party nominee for president. Among the last round candidates were U.S. senators Bob Graham, John Kerry and John Edwards. The nomination committee was headed by Warren Christopher. Lieberman was the first Jewish candidate on a major political party ticket. Of the vetting process, Lieberman related a conversation in which Christopher told him the background checks would be &quot;like a medical procedure without an anesthesia.&quot;

The Gore–Lieberman ticket won a plurality of the popular vote, with over half a million more votes than the Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, but they were defeated in the Electoral College by a vote of 271 to 266 after an intense legal battle concerning the outcome in disputed counties (see &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;). The US Supreme Court ruled that the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s ordered recount was unconstitutional and said that it defers to what it believes is the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s judgment that December 12 is the deadline for all recounts—thus preventing a new recount from being ordered.

Lieberman decided to run for re-election to maintain his Senate seat, as vice-presidential candidates Joe Biden and Paul Ryan did for their senatorial and congressional seats respectively in 2008 and 2012. He won re-election and continued to serve in the Senate until his retirement in 2012.

===2004===

On January 13, 2003, Lieberman announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination as a candidate in the 2004 presidential election. Lieberman campaigned on his experience in government as well as his centrist and hawkish positions. Indeed, he initially led in polls of primaries, but due to his political positions he failed to win a support of liberal Democratic voters, who dominated the primaries.

Prior to his defeat in New Hampshire, Lieberman declared that his campaign was picking up &quot;Joementum&quot;; however, he failed to provide such momentum during the New Hampshire primary debates, held at Saint Anselm College days before the primary. On February 3, 2004, Lieberman withdrew his candidacy after failing to win any of the five primaries or two caucuses held that day. He acknowledged to the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; that his support for the war in Iraq was a large part of his undoing with voters.

Lieberman&#x27;s former running candidate Al Gore did not support Lieberman&#x27;s presidential run, and in December 2003 endorsed Howard Dean&#x27;s candidacy, saying &quot;This is about all of us and all of us need to get behind the strongest candidate [Dean].&quot; Finally, Lieberman withdrew from the race without winning a single contest. In total popular vote he placed 7th behind the eventual nominee, Massachusetts senator John Kerry; the eventual vice presidential nominee, North Carolina Senator John Edwards; former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean; Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich; retired General Wesley Clark; and Reverend Al Sharpton.

===2008===
On December 17, 2007, Lieberman endorsed Republican Senator John McCain for president in 2008, going against his party and going back on his stance in July 2006 when he stated &quot;I want Democrats to be back in the majority in Washington and elect a Democratic president in 2008.&quot; Lieberman cited his agreement with McCain&#x27;s stance on the War on Terrorism as the primary reason for the endorsement.

On June 5, 2008, Lieberman launched &quot;Citizens for McCain&quot;, hosted on the McCain campaign website, to recruit Democratic support for John McCain&#x27;s candidacy. He emphasized the group&#x27;s outreach to supporters of Hillary Clinton, who was at that time broadly expected to lose the Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama. Citizens for McCain was prominently featured in McCain team efforts to attract disgruntled Hillary Clinton supporters such as Debra Bartoshevich.

Lieberman spoke at the 2008 Republican National Convention on behalf of McCain and his running mate, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Lieberman was alongside McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham during a visit to French president Nicolas Sarkozy on March 21, 2008. Lieberman was mentioned as a possible vice presidential nominee on a McCain ticket. ABC News reported that Lieberman was McCain&#x27;s first choice for vice president until several days before the selection, when McCain had decided that picking Lieberman would alienate the conservative base of the Republican Party. Lieberman had been mentioned as a possible Secretary of State under a McCain administration.

Many Democrats wanted Lieberman to be stripped of his chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs due to his support for John McCain which went against the party&#x27;s wishes. Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reached out to Lieberman, asking him to caucus with the Republicans. Ultimately, the Senate Democratic Caucus voted 42 to 13 to allow Lieberman to keep chairmanship (although he did lose his membership for the Environment and Public Works Committee). Subsequently, Lieberman announced that he would continue to caucus with the Democrats. Lieberman credited President-elect Barack Obama for helping him keep his chairmanship. Obama had privately urged Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid not to remove Lieberman from his position. Reid stated that Lieberman&#x27;s criticism of Obama during the election angered him, but that &quot;if you look at the problems we face as a nation, is this a time we walk out of here saying, &#x27;Boy did we get even&#x27;?&quot; Senator Tom Carper of Delaware also credited the Democrats&#x27; decision on Lieberman to Obama&#x27;s support, stating that &quot;If Barack can move on, so can we.&quot;

Some members of the Democratic caucus were reportedly angry at the decision not to punish Lieberman more severely. The independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont stated that he voted to punish Lieberman &quot;because while millions of people worked hard for Obama, Lieberman actively worked for four more years of President Bush&#x27;s policies.&quot; Lieberman&#x27;s embrace of certain conservative policies and in particular his endorsement of John McCain have been cited as factors for his high approval rating among Republicans in Connecticut with 66% of Republicans approving of him along with 52% of independents also approving of his job performance; this is also cited for his mediocre approval rating among Democrats: 44% approving and 46% disapproving. In September 2018, Lieberman gave a eulogy at the funeral of John McCain, in which he stated that he had turned down a request to serve as McCain&#x27;s 2008 running mate.

===2012, 2016, and 2020===
In April 2012, Lieberman announced that he would not make any public endorsements in the 2012 presidential election between President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. On August 10, 2016, Lieberman endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. On September 13, 2020, Lieberman endorsed Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

==Criticism==
=== Iraq War support ===
Lieberman was a supporter of the Iraq War and urged action against Iran. In July 2008, Lieberman spoke at the annual conference of Christians United for Israel (CUFI). In July 2009, he accepted CUFI&#x27;s &quot;Defender of Israel Award&quot; from John Hagee. Pastor Hagee, CUFI&#x27;s founder and leader, made a number of controversial remarks, including a statement that the Catholic Church is &quot;the great whore&quot; and a suggestion that God allowed the Holocaust to happen to bring the Jews to Israel.

=== Islamic extremism controversy ===
In April 2010, Lieberman blasted President Obama for stripping terms like &quot;Islamic extremism&quot; from a key national security document, calling the move dishonest, wrong-headed, and disrespectful to the majority of Muslims who are not terrorists.

=== Filibuster ===
While favoring the filibuster and threatening to use it in 2009 to eliminate a public health option as part of the healthcare proposal, Lieberman once strongly opposed the filibuster. In 1995, he joined with Senator Tom Harkin to co-sponsor an amendment to kill the filibuster. Lieberman told the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;: &quot;The filibuster hurts the credibility of the entire Senate and impedes progress.&quot;

=== Support for surveillance ===
Lieberman favored greater use of surveillance cameras by the federal government and referred to attempts by Congress to investigate illegal wiretapping as &quot;partisan gridlock&quot;. On June 19, 2010, Lieberman introduced a bill called &quot;Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010&quot;, which he co-wrote with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senator Thomas Carper (D-DE). If signed into law, this controversial bill, which the American media dubbed the &quot;Internet kill switch&quot;, would grant the President emergency powers over the Internet; however, all three co-authors of the bill issued a statement claiming that instead, the bill &quot;[narrowed] existing broad Presidential authority to take over telecommunications networks&quot;. American computer security specialist and author Bruce Schneier objected to the &quot;kill switch&quot; proposal on the basis that it rests on several faulty assumptions and that it&#x27;s &quot;too coarse a hammer&quot;. However, Schneier also wrote: &quot;Defending his proposal, Sen. Lieberman pointed out that China has this capability. It&#x27;s debatable whether or not it actually does, but it&#x27;s actively pursuing the capability because the country cares less about its citizens. Here in the U.S., it is both wrong and dangerous to give the president the power and ability to commit Internet suicide and terrorize Americans in this way.&quot;

=== Suppressing whistleblowing ===
Lieberman was a major opponent of the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. His staff &quot;made inquiries&quot; of Amazon.com and other internet companies such as PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard which resulted in them suspending service to WikiLeaks. Journalist Glenn Greenwald called Lieberman&#x27;s actions &quot;one of the most pernicious acts by a U.S. Senator in quite some time,&quot; and accused Lieberman of &quot;emulat[ing] Chinese dictators&quot; by &quot;abusing his position as Homeland Security Chairman to thuggishly dictate to private companies which websites they should and should not host – and, more important, what you can and cannot read on the Internet.&quot; Lieberman also suggested that &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; and other news organisations publishing the U.S. embassy cables being released by WikiLeaks could be investigated for breaking US espionage laws.&quot;

Along with Senators John Ensign and Scott Brown, Lieberman &quot;introduced a bill to amend the Espionage Act in order to facilitate the prosecution of folks like Wikileaks.&quot; Critics have noted that &quot;[l]eaking [classified] information in the first place is already a crime, so the measure is aimed squarely at publishers,&quot; and that &quot;Lieberman&#x27;s proposed solution to WikiLeaks could have implications for journalists reporting on some of the more unsavory practices of the intelligence community.&quot; Legal analyst Benjamin Wittes called the proposed legislation &quot;the worst of both worlds&quot;, saying:

As a result of these statements and actions, Lieberman was perceived as an opponent of Internet free speech and became the target of Anonymous attacks under Operation Payback.

==Political positions==

Lieberman was a strong advocate for the war in Iraq. He was also a strong supporter of the U.S.-Israel relationship. On domestic issues, he supported free trade economics while also reliably voting for pro-trade union legislation. As part of the Gang of 14, he opposed filibustering Republican judicial appointments. Lieberman was a supporter of abortion rights and of the rights of gays and lesbians to be protected with hate crime legislation, and to serve openly in the military. Lieberman was one of the Senate&#x27;s leading opponents of violence in video games and on television. Lieberman described himself as being &quot;genuinely an Independent&quot;, saying &quot;I agree more often than not with Democrats on domestic policy. I agree more often than not with Republicans on foreign and defense policy.&quot; Lieberman was known for his leadership in the successful effort to repeal the Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy regarding sexual orientation in the U.S. Armed Forces.

During debate on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Lieberman opposed the public option. As the crucial 60th vote needed to pass the legislation, his opposition to the public option was critical for its removal from the resulting bill. Lieberman was an integral part in attempting to stop WikiLeaks from publishing further material using U.S.-based corporations in the United States diplomatic cables leak of 2010. That same year, he joined Republican Senator Scott Brown and bipartisan House members Jason Altmire and Charlie Dent in introducing the Terrorist Expatriation Act, which proposed stripping citizenship rights from Americans who took arms against the United States or provided material support to enemy combatants. The bill received mixed reviews and was heavily criticized by some senior Democrats.

In June 2015, Lieberman was a signatory to a public letter written by a bipartisan group of 19 U.S. diplomats, experts, and others, on the then-pending negotiations for an agreement between Iran and world powers over Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. That letter outlined concerns about several provisions in the then-unfinished agreement and called for a number of improvements to strengthen the prospective agreement and win the letter-writers&#x27; support for it. The final agreement, concluded in July 2015, shows the influence of the letter.

In May 2021, Lieberman expressed support for Israel in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and praised &quot;the quiet and effective diplomacy of President Biden, who was not drawn in by the left of the Democratic Party to essentially take a stand against Israel.&quot;

==Post-Senate career==
A survey in October 2010 showed that Lieberman had an approval rating of 31% and that just 24% of Connecticut voters felt he deserved re-election. Lieberman announced on January 19, 2011, that he would retire from the Senate at the end of his fourth term. Lieberman gave his farewell address on December 12, 2012. He was succeeded by Democratic representative Chris Murphy.

Following his retirement from the Senate, Lieberman moved to Riverdale, Bronx, and registered to vote in New York as a Democrat. He became senior counsel of the white collar criminal defense and investigations practice at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres &amp; Friedman, a law firm in New York City whose notable clients include Donald Trump. In March 2013, it was announced that Lieberman would be joining the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank as co-chairman of their American Internationalism Project, alongside former Republican Senator Jon Kyl. In February 2014, Lieberman was named as Counselor at the National Bureau of Asian Research. Additionally, he served as the Lieberman Chair of Public Policy and Public Service at Yeshiva University, where he taught an undergraduate course in political science.

In 2015, Lieberman served as co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a commission that recommended changes to U.S. policy regarding biodefense. In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Lieberman headed the organization with former Governor Tom Ridge, and the Study Panel assembled in Washington, D.C., for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had inadequate defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel&#x27;s final report, &quot;The National Blueprint for Biodefense&quot;, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the vice president authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel&#x27;s call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues. In 2022, the group released a report recommending a $10 billion, 10-year program to prevent the next pandemic, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In August 2015, Lieberman became chairman of the advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI). In March 2016, Lieberman was hired by the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation to assist the group in challenging Connecticut laws giving exemptions to only the top two state gaming tribes to build casinos. That same year, Lieberman joined the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council, an organization founded to address anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish bigotry in the United States. Lieberman was also on the advisory board of the Counter Extremism Project (CEP).

In early 2017, Lieberman introduced President elect Donald Trump&#x27;s nominee as Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee. One report on Lieberman&#x27;s involvement was critical of him for failing to disclose in his testimony the extensive legal work his Kasowitz, Benson, Torres &amp; Friedman law firm had done for Donald Trump since at least as long ago as 2001. The work included bankrupt casino restructuring and, during the 2016 campaign, threatening &quot;The New York Times&quot; over publication of a few 1995 Trump tax documents.

On May 17, 2017, Lieberman was interviewed by President Donald Trump for the position of FBI Director, to replace recently fired James Comey. The interview took place against the background of the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate issues connected to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Speaking to reporters while meeting with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Trump said he was &quot;very close&quot; to choosing a new FBI director to replace James Comey, and when asked if Lieberman was his top pick, Trump said yes. The President also stated that the odds were &quot;better than 50-50&quot; that his pick for FBI director would be made before he departed for his first trip abroad on Friday; however, no announcement was made publicly on Friday. On May 25, 2017, Lieberman officially withdrew his name from consideration.

On July 17, 2018, Lieberman published an opinion piece in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; imploring people to vote for Joe Crowley, who was defeated in the Democratic primary by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Crowley would run on the Working Families Party line, without support of a major party, similar to how Lieberman defeated Lamont in 2006. Lieberman continued to remain critical of Ocasio-Cortez, stating that &quot;With all respect, I certainly hope she&#x27;s not the future, and I don&#x27;t believe she is.&quot; In January 2019 Lieberman officially registered as a lobbyist working for ZTE but stated that his work for the corporation will be limited to assess national security concerns and will not include actual lobbying. In July 2022, Lieberman became one of the founding members of a group of U.S. business and policy leaders which shares the goal of engaging constructively with China and improving U.S.-China relations.

A founding co-chairman of No Labels since its inception in 2010, Lieberman had helped to lead the group’s efforts to promote bipartisanship in Congress. In 2023, Lieberman wrote two opinion pieces in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; asking people to consider supporting a No Labels unity presidential ticket in the 2024 presidential election. No Labels did surveys of thousands of voters to understand what they care about, concluding that most Americans are dissatisfied with both major political parties and that most of them supported having additional choices for president beyond the two major party nominees. No Labels secured ballot access in 24 states before ending its effort to find a unity ticket in April 2024 after the group could not find a candidate willing to lead the ticket.

==Personal life and death==
Lieberman met his first wife, Betty Haas, at the congressional office of Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D-CT), where they worked as summer student interns. They married in 1965 while Joe Lieberman was in law school. They had two children – Matt and Rebecca. Betty, who is also Jewish, later worked as a psychiatric social worker. In 1981, the couple divorced. When asked about the divorce in an interview with &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, Lieberman said, &quot;one of the differences we had was in levels of religious observance&quot;, adding, &quot;I&#x27;m convinced if that was the only difference, we wouldn&#x27;t have gotten divorced.&quot;
In 1982, Lieberman met his second wife, Hadassah Freilich Tucker, while he was running for Attorney General of Connecticut. Hadassah Tucker&#x27;s parents were Holocaust survivors. According to &quot;Washington Jewish Week&quot;, Lieberman called her for a date because he thought it would be interesting to go out with someone named Hadassah. ( is the Hebrew name of Esther in the biblical Book of Esther, and subsequently also the name of the Women&#x27;s Zionist Organization of America). From March 2005, Hadassah Lieberman worked for Hill &amp; Knowlton, a lobbying firm based in New York City, as a senior counselor in its health and pharmaceuticals practice. She held senior positions at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven, the American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO), Pfizer, National Research Council, Hoffmann-La Roche, and Lehman Brothers.

Joe and Hadassah Lieberman had a daughter, Hana. In 2018, she immigrated to Israel with her family. Lieberman also had a stepson from Hadassah&#x27;s previous marriage with Gordon Tucker, Ethan Tucker. Lieberman&#x27;s son, Matt, graduated from Yale University and from Yale Law School. Matt is the former head of the school of Greenfield Hebrew Academy in Atlanta and was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2020 United States Senate special election in Georgia. Rebecca, Lieberman&#x27;s daughter, graduated from Barnard College in 1991, and from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1997. Lieberman&#x27;s stepson Ethan graduated from Harvard College in 1997 and received his rabbinic ordination from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.
Lieberman described himself as an observant Jew. His first wife, Betty Haas, is a Reform Jew. After the death of his grandmother, a deeply religious immigrant, in 1967, he found a renewed interest in religious observance. His second wife, Hadassah, is also an observant Modern Orthodox Jew. &quot;Hadassah calls herself my right wing&quot;, said Lieberman. In Lieberman&#x27;s 1988 upset of Republican Party incumbent Senator Lowell Weicker, Lieberman&#x27;s religious observance was mostly viewed in terms of refusal to campaign on the Shabbat. This changed when Al Gore chose Lieberman as the running mate; a Lieberman press officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said: &quot;He refers to himself as observant, as opposed to Orthodox, because he doesn&#x27;t follow the strict Orthodox code and doesn&#x27;t want to offend the Orthodox, and his wife feels the same way.&quot;

The Liebermans kept a kosher home and observed the Sabbath. In one notable instance, then-Senator Lieberman walked to the Capitol after Sabbath services to block a Republican filibuster. Lieberman said that there was currently &quot;a constitutional place for faith in our public life&quot;, and that the Constitution does not provide for &quot;freedom from religion&quot;. He attended Kesher Israel Congregation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., and Beth Hamedrosh Hagodol – B&#x27;nai Israel, The Westville Synagogue, New Haven, Connecticut. He also attended Congregation Agudath Sholom in his hometown of Stamford. Lieberman was an admirer of the last Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson. He said of Schneerson, &quot;I was impressed by this man, by his obvious spirituality, by his soaring intellect, by the extent to which he was involved in the world.&quot; He said he had studied the commentaries of Rabbis Joseph Ber Soloveitchik and Abraham Isaac Kook.

Lieberman was the first person of Jewish background or faith to run on a major party presidential ticket. Lieberman said that he liked to sing and was a fan of Frank Sinatra, whose song &quot;My Way&quot; was the theme of his first Senate campaign. He chanted the classic section of Proverbs &quot;Eshet Hayil&quot; to his wife every Friday night. On March 27, 2024, Lieberman died at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, aged 82, from injuries that he sustained in a fall at his home in the Bronx. He received tributes from many, including from Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Vice Presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence and Gore, Senators Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham, and Israeli politicians Isaac Herzog and Benjamin Netanyahu. Lieberman is entombed in the cemetery at Congregation Agudath Sholom.

==Electoral history==
==Awards==

In 2008, Lieberman received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

In 2011, the National Defense University foundation honored Senators Lieberman and John McCain the American Patriot Award for their lifetimes of public service. They were recognized for their outstanding record of contributions to America&#x27;s national security, armed forces and veterans throughout their impressive careers in government.

In 2011, Lieberman was awarded St. George Order of Victory by President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili for his support of Georgia following their 2008 war with Russia.

==Published works==
Lieberman authored at least 10 books, including &quot;The Power Broker&quot; (1966), a biography of the late Democratic Party chairman John M. Bailey; 
&quot;The Scorpion and the Tarantula&quot; (1970), a study of early efforts to control nuclear proliferation; 
&quot;The Legacy&quot; (1981), a history of Connecticut politics from 1930 to 1980;
&quot;Child Support in America: Practical Advice on Negotiating and Collecting a Fair Settlement&quot; (1986), a guidebook on methods to increase the collection of child support from delinquent fathers; 
&quot;In Praise of Public Life&quot; (2000); 
&quot;An Amazing Adventure: Joe and Hadassah&#x27;s Personal Notes on the 2000 Campaign&quot; (2003), reflecting on his 2000 vice presidential run; 
&quot;The Gift of Rest: Rediscovering the Beauty of the Sabbath&quot; (2011), written with David Klinghoffer, 
&quot;With Liberty and Justice: The Fifty-Day Journey from Egypt to Sinai&quot; (2018), on a trip with Rabbi Ari D. Kahn, and 
&quot;The Centrist Solution: How We Made Government Work and Can Make It Work Again&quot; (2021).
In his book &quot;Ticking Time Bomb: Counter-Terrorism Lessons from the U.S. Government&#x27;s Failure to Prevent the Fort Hood Attack&quot; (2011), he described Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Mohammad, American-Yemeni imam Anwar al-Awlaki, Muslim cleric Abdullah el-Faisal, and Pakistani-American Samir Khan as &quot;virtual spiritual sanctioners&quot; who use the internet to offer religious justification for Islamist terrorism.

<doc id="74461" wikidata="Q174908" url="?curid=74461" title="Michael Moore">
<text>Michael Francis Moore (born April 23, 1954) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, and author. Moore&#x27;s work frequently addresses various social, political, and economic topics. He first became publicly known for his award-winning debut documentary &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;, a scathing look at the downfall of the automotive industry in 1980s Flint and Detroit.

Moore followed up and won the 2002 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, which examines the causes of the Columbine High School massacre and the overall gun culture in the United States. He directed and produced &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, a critical look at the early presidency of George W. Bush and the War on Terror, which earned $119,194,771 to become the highest-grossing documentary at the American box office of all time. The film won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, and was the subject of intense controversy. His documentary &quot;Sicko&quot; examines health care in the United States, and is one of the top ten highest-grossing documentaries . In September 2008, he released his first free film on the Internet, &quot;Slacker Uprising&quot;, which documents his personal quest to encourage Americans to vote in presidential elections. He has written and starred in &quot;TV Nation&quot;, a satirical news-magazine television series, and &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, a satirical show. In 2018, he released his latest film, &quot;Fahrenheit 11/9&quot;, a documentary about the 2016 United States presidential election and the presidency of Donald Trump. He was executive producer of &quot;Planet of the Humans&quot; (2019), a documentary about the environmental movement.

Moore&#x27;s works criticize topics such as globalization, big business, assault weapon ownership, Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump, the Iraq War, the American health care system, and capitalism overall. In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; named Moore one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people. Some critics have labeled Moore a &quot;propagandist&quot; and his films propaganda.

==Early life and education==
Moore was born in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in the nearby suburb of Davison, where he was raised by parents Veronica (&quot;née&quot; Wall), and Francis Richard &quot;Frank&quot; Moore, an automotive assembly-line worker. At that time, Flint was home to many General Motors factories, where his parents and grandfather worked. His uncle LaVerne was one of the founders of the United Automobile Workers labor union and participated in the Flint sit-down strike.

Moore was brought up in a traditional Catholic home, and has Irish, and smaller amounts of Scottish and English, ancestry. Some of his ancestors were Quakers.

Moore attended the parochial St. John&#x27;s Elementary School, in John the Evangelist Parish, for primary school, and later attended St. Paul&#x27;s Seminary in Saginaw, Michigan, for a year. He then attended Davison High School, where he was active in both drama and debate, graduating in 1972. As a member of the Boy Scouts of America, he achieved the rank of Eagle Scout.

At the age of 18, he was elected to the Davison school board.&lt;ref name=&quot;nextcity/flint-in-washington&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he was the youngest person elected to office in the U.S., as the minimum age to hold public office had just been lowered to 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/trouble-moore&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Moore attended the University of Michigan–Flint but dropped out during his second year.

==Career==

===Journalism===
At age 22, Moore founded&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn/2004/07/05/fahrenheit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative newspaper &quot;Free to Be...&quot;, later renamed &quot;The Flint Voice&quot; (Burton, Michigan 1977–1982&lt;ref name=&quot;loc.gov/sn93023624&quot;&gt;*
* &lt;/ref&gt;), later renamed to &quot;The Michigan Voice&quot; (Burton, Michigan 1983–1986&lt;ref name=&quot;loc.gov/sn93023625&quot;&gt;*
* &lt;/ref&gt;) as it expanded to cover the entire state.&lt;ref name=&quot;mlive/history-roger-me&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica/Michael-Moore&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eastvillagemagazine./ben-hamper-rivethead&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia.com/michael-moore&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer-songwriter Harry Chapin is credited with being the primary benefactor in bringing about the bi-weekly newspaper&#x27;s launch, by performing benefit concerts and donating the money to Moore. Moore crept backstage after a concert to Chapin&#x27;s dressing room and convinced him to do a benefit concert. Chapin subsequently did a concert in Flint every year.

In April 1986, &quot;The Michigan Voice&quot; published its final issue as Moore moved to San Francisco.

After four months at &quot;Mother Jones&quot; in 1986, Moore was fired in early September. Matt Labash of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; reported this was for refusing to print an article by Paul Berman that was critical of the Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua. Moore refused to run the article because he believed it was inaccurate
and would be used by the Reagan Administration against the Sandinistas. Speaking on the matter, Moore stated, &quot;The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years.&quot; Chairman of the Foundation for National Progress (which owns &quot;Mother Jones&quot;) Adam Hochschild said that Moore was fired due to performing poorly at his job. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, senior staff members felt that Moore was &quot;rigidly ideological&quot;.

Moore has contended that &quot;Mother Jones&quot; fired him because of the publisher&#x27;s refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. Moore responded by putting laid-off GM worker Ben Hamper, who also wrote for the same magazine at the time, on the magazine&#x27;s cover. This act led to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with some of the seed money,&lt;ref name=&quot;afi/Catalog/58258&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with other fund raising efforts, including bingo games,&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia/moore-michael-1954&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for his first film, &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;. Moore worked for Ralph Nader as the editor of a newsletter after being fired by &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, which provided further financial support during this period.

===Directing, producing and screenwriting===
====&quot;Roger and Me&quot;====
The 1989 film &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; was Moore&#x27;s first documentary about what happened to Flint, Michigan, after General Motors closed its factories and opened new ones in Mexico where the workers were paid lower wages than their American counterparts. The &quot;Roger&quot; referred to in the title is Roger B. Smith, then CEO and President of General Motors.

Harlan Jacobson, editor of &quot;Film Comment&quot; magazine, said that Moore muddled the chronology in &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; to make it seem that events that took place before G.M.&#x27;s layoffs were a consequence of them. Critic Roger Ebert defended Moore&#x27;s handling of the timeline as an artistic and stylistic choice that had less to do with his credibility as a filmmaker and more to do with the flexibility of film as a medium to express a satiric viewpoint.

====&quot;Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint&quot;====
Moore made a follow-up 23-minute documentary film, &quot;Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint&quot;, that aired on PBS in 1992. It is based on &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;. The film&#x27;s title refers to Rhonda Britton, a Flint, Michigan resident featured in both the 1989 and 1992 films, who sells rabbits as either pets or meat.

====&quot;Canadian Bacon&quot;====
Moore&#x27;s 1995 satirical film &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; features a fictional U.S. president (played by Alan Alda) engineering a fake war with Canada to boost his popularity. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian actor John Candy. Some commentators in the media felt the film was influenced by the Stanley Kubrick film &quot;Dr. Strangelove.&quot;

====&quot;The Big One&quot;====
Moore&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;The Big One&quot; documents the tour publicizing Moore&#x27;s book &quot;Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American,&quot; in which he criticizes mass layoffs despite record corporate profits. Among others, he targets Nike for outsourcing shoe production to Indonesia.

====&quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;====
His documentary &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, released in 2002, probes the culture of guns and violence in the United States, taking, as a starting point, the Columbine High School massacre of 1999. &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; won the Anniversary Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and France&#x27;s César Award as the Best Foreign Film. In the United States, it won the 2002 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. It also enjoyed great commercial and critical success for a film of its type, and has since gone on to be considered one of the greatest documentary films of all-time. At the time of &quot;Columbine&quot;″s release, it was the highest-grossing mainstream-released documentary (a record now held by Moore&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;).

Shortly after winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, Moore spoke out against U.S. President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, which had just started three days prior. He further criticized the president by stating, &quot;We live in a time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons.&quot; The speech was received with a cacophony of boos, applause, and standing ovations from the audience at the theater. Moments after the speech concluded, to lighten the mood, host Steve Martin joked, &quot;The Teamsters are helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.&quot;

====&quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;====
Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, released in 2004, examines America in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, particularly the record of the George W. Bush Administration and alleged links between the families of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden. &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; was awarded the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot;, the top honor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. It was the first documentary film to win the prize since 1956&#x27;s &quot;The Silent World&quot;.

Moore later announced that &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; would not be in consideration for the 2005 Academy Award for Documentary Feature, but instead for the Academy Award for Best Picture. He stated he wanted the movie to be seen by a few million more people via television broadcasting prior to Election Day. According to Moore, &quot;Academy rules forbid the airing of a documentary on television within nine months of its theatrical release&quot;, and since the November 2 election was fewer than nine months after the film&#x27;s release, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; would have been disqualified for the Documentary Oscar. Regardless, it did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.

The title of the film alludes to the classic book &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; by Ray Bradbury, about a future totalitarian state in which books are banned, and any books found are burned by firemen. According to the novel, paper begins to burn at . The pre-release subtitle of Moore&#x27;s film continues the allusion: &quot;The temperature at which freedom burns.&quot;

As of August 2012, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; is the highest-grossing documentary of all time, taking in over US$200 million worldwide, including United States box office revenue of almost US$120 million. In February 2011, Moore sued producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein for US$2.7 million in unpaid profits from the film, claiming they used &quot;Hollywood accounting tricks&quot; to avoid paying him the money. In February 2012, Moore and the Weinsteins informed the court that they had settled their dispute.

&quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; drew criticism and controversy following its release just prior to the 2004 United States presidential election. Journalist and literary critic Christopher Hitchens alleged that the film contained distortions and untruths. This contention drew multiple rebuttals, including an eFilmCritic article and an editorial in the &quot;Columbus Free Press&quot;.

====&quot;Sicko&quot;====
Moore directed the 2007 film &quot;Sicko&quot;, about the American health care system, focusing particularly on the managed-care and pharmaceutical industries. At least four major pharmaceutical companies—Pfizer, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline—ordered their employees not to grant any interviews or assist Moore. According to Moore in a letter on his website, &quot;roads that often surprise us and lead us to new ideas—and challenge us to reconsider the ones we began with have caused some minor delays.&quot; The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2007, receiving a lengthy standing ovation, and was released in the U.S. and Canada on June 29, 2007. The film is currently ranked the twelfth highest grossing documentary of all time and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature.

====&quot;Captain Mike Across America&quot; and &quot;Slacker Uprising&quot;====
Moore takes a look at the politics of college students in what he calls &quot;Bush Administration America&quot; with &quot;Captain Mike Across America&quot;, which was shot during Moore&#x27;s 62-city college campus tour in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election. The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2007. It was later re-edited by Moore into &quot;Slacker Uprising&quot; and released for free on the internet on September 23, 2008.

====&quot;Capitalism: A Love Story&quot;====
Released on September 23, 2009, &quot;&quot; looks at the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the U.S. economy during the transition between the outgoing Bush Administration and the incoming Obama Administration. Addressing a press conference at its release, Moore said, &quot;Democracy is not a spectator sport, it&#x27;s a participatory event. If we don&#x27;t participate in it, it ceases to be a democracy. So Obama will rise or fall based not so much on what he does but on what we do to support him.&quot;

====&quot;Where to Invade Next&quot;====
&quot;Where to Invade Next&quot; examines the benefits of progressive social policies in various countries. The film had its premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. Godfrey Cheshire, writing for Roger Ebert.com, wrote that &quot;Moore&#x27;s surprising and extraordinarily winning &quot;Where to Invade Next&quot; will almost surely cast his detractors at Fox News and similar sinkholes into consternation&quot;.

====&quot;Michael Moore in TrumpLand&quot;====
In &quot;Michael Moore in TrumpLand&quot;, Moore talks about the 2016 Presidential Election Campaigns. It is a solo performance showing Moore on stage speaking to a seated audience. The film consists of Moore&#x27;s opinions of the candidates and highlights the Democratic National Candidate Hillary Clinton&#x27;s strengths and also features a lengthy section on how the Republican National Candidate Donald Trump could win. It was filmed in Wilmington, Ohio, at the Murphy Theatre over the course of two nights in October 2016. The film premiered just eleven days after it was shot at the IFC Center in New York City.

====&quot;Fahrenheit 11/9&quot;====
In May 2017, it was announced that Moore had reunited with Harvey Weinstein to direct his new film about Donald Trump, titled &quot;Fahrenheit 11/9&quot;, which was released in approximately 1,500 theaters in the United States and Canada on September 21, 2018. Sexual assault allegations against Weinstein prompted Moore to revoke the plan to work with The Weinstein Company, which stalled production.

The title refers to the day when Donald Trump officially became President-elect of the United States. In a column for &quot;Variety&quot; responding to the film&#x27;s low opening weekend, &quot;How Michael Moore Lost His Audience,&quot; sympathetic film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote &quot;He&#x27;s like an aging rock star putting out albums that simply don&#x27;t mean as much to those who were, and are, his core fans&quot;. According to Glenn Greenwald, &quot;what he&#x27;s trying is of unparalleled importance, not to take the cheap route of exclusively denouncing Trump, but to take the more complicated, challenging, and productive route of understanding who and what created the climate in which Trump could thrive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fahrenheit 11/9&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====&quot;Planet of the Humans&quot;====

Michael Moore was executive producer of the documentary &quot;Planet of the Humans&quot;, which was directed by Jeff Gibbs and released on July 31, 2019. The film makes the argument that, since the first Earth Day, the condition of the planet has worsened, and questions whether mainstream approaches adopted by industry to mitigate climate change, entail environmental impacts whose costs are comparable to or even possibly outweigh the benefits. The film received criticism from a number of climate change experts and activists who disputed its claims, and the accuracy of figures cited in the film, and suggested that the film could play into the hands of the fossil fuel industry.

Michael Moore, Jeff Gibbs, and co-producer Ozzie Zehner responded to the critics on an episode of &quot;Rising&quot;.

===Writing===

Moore has written and co-written eight non-fiction books, mostly on similar subject matter to his documentaries. &quot;Stupid White Men&quot; (2001) is ostensibly a critique of American domestic and foreign policy but, by Moore&#x27;s own admission, is also &quot;a book of political humor&quot;. &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Country?&quot; (2003), is an examination of the Bush family&#x27;s relationships with Saudi royalty, the Bin Laden family, and the energy industry, and a call-to-action for liberals in the 2004 election. Several of his works have made bestseller lists.

===Acting===
Moore has dabbled in acting, following a supporting role in &quot;Lucky Numbers&quot; (2000) playing the cousin of Lisa Kudrow&#x27;s character, who agrees to be part of the scheme concocted by John Travolta&#x27;s character. He also had a cameo in his &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; as an anti-Canada activist. In 1999, he did a cameo in &quot;EDtv&quot; as one of the panel members. In 2004, he did a cameo, as a news journalist, in &quot;The Fever&quot;, starring Vanessa Redgrave in the lead.

===Television===
Between 1994 and 1995, Moore directed and hosted the BBC television series &quot;TV Nation&quot;, which followed the format of news magazine shows but covered topics they avoid. The series aired on BBC2 in the UK. The series was also aired in the US on NBC in 1994 for 9 episodes and again for 8 episodes on Fox in 1995.

His other major series was &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, which satirized actions by big corporations and politicians. It aired on the UK&#x27;s Channel 4, and the Bravo network in the US, in 1999 and 2000. Moore won the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in Arts and Entertainment for being the executive producer and host of &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, where he was also described as &quot;muckraker, author and documentary filmmaker&quot;.

Another 1999 series, &quot;Michael Moore Live&quot;, was aired in the UK only on Channel 4, though it was broadcast from New York. This show had a similar format to &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week.

In 2017, Moore planned to return to prime time network television on Turner/TNT in late 2017 or early 2018 with a program called &quot;Michael Moore Live from the Apocalypse&quot;. In February 2019, however, the network announced the show would not be produced.

===Music videos===

Moore has directed several music videos, including two for Rage Against the Machine for songs from &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot;: &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot; and &quot;Testify&quot;. He was threatened with arrest during the shooting of &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot;, which was filmed on Wall Street; and subsequently the city of New York City denied the band permission to play there, even though the band and Moore had secured a federal permit to perform.

Moore also directed the videos for R.E.M. single &quot;All the Way to Reno (You&#x27;re Gonna Be a Star)&quot; in 2001 and the System of a Down song &quot;Boom!&quot;.

===Appearances in other documentaries===

* He appeared in &quot;The Drugging of Our Children&quot;, a 2005 documentary about over-prescription of psychiatric medication to children and teenagers, directed by Gary Null, a proponent of alternative medicine. In the film Moore agrees with Gary Null that Ritalin and other similar drugs are over-prescribed, saying that they are seen as a &quot;pacifier&quot;.
* He appeared on fellow Flint natives Grand Funk Railroad&#x27;s episode of &quot;Behind the Music&quot;.
* He appeared as an off-camera interviewer in &quot;Blood in the Face&quot;, a 1991 documentary about white supremacy groups. At the center of the film is a neo-Nazi gathering in Michigan.
* Moore appeared in the 2001 documovie &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; discussing Democrats and Republicans.
* He appeared in &quot;The Yes Men&quot;, a 2003 documentary about two men who pose as the World Trade Organization. He appears during a segment concerning working conditions in Mexico and Latin America.
* Moore was interviewed for the 2004 documentary, &quot;The Corporation&quot;. One of his highlighted quotes was: &quot;The problem is the profit motive: for corporations, there&#x27;s no such thing as enough.&quot;
* He appeared in the 2006 documentary &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Tell You a Secret&quot;, which chronicles Madonna&#x27;s 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. Moore attended her show in New York City at Madison Square Garden.
* He appeared briefly in the 2016 documentary &quot;Cameraperson&quot;, directed by Kirsten Johnson, who was one of his camera operators in Fahrenheit 9/11

===Theater===
Moore&#x27;s Broadway debut, &quot;The Terms of My Surrender&quot;, an anti-Trump dramatic monologue, premiered on August 10, 2017, at the Belasco Theatre. Donald Trump tweeted his dislike for the show and falsely claimed that it closed early. In the first week the production earned $456,195 in sales and $367,634 in the final week, altogether grossing $4.2 million, falling short of its potential gross. It lasted 13 weeks with 96 performances until October 2017, grossing 49% of its potential. Fox News gave it a negative review, in line with Trump&#x27;s comments. The show was unenthusiastically praised by The Guardian, which said he only wanted to &quot;preach to the choir&quot;. A spokesman for &quot;The Terms of My Surrender&quot; suggested that the production might have a in San Francisco in early 2018, which didn&#x27;t materialize.

==Honorary degree==
He was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humanities from Michigan State University in Fall 2014.

==Political views==
Although Moore has been known for his political activism, he rejects the label as redundant in a democracy: &quot;I and you and everyone else has to be a political activist. If we&#x27;re not politically active, it ceases to be a democracy.&quot; According to John Flesher of the Associated Press, Moore is known for his &quot;fiery left-wing populism&quot;, and publications such as the &quot;Socialist Worker Online&quot; have hailed him as the &quot;new Tom Paine&quot;. In a speech, he said that socialism is democracy and Christianity. However, he later said that economic philosophies from the past were not apt enough to describe today&#x27;s realities.

Moore was a high-profile guest at both the 2004 Democratic National Convention and the 2004 Republican National Convention, chronicling his impressions in &quot;USA Today&quot;. He was criticized in a speech by Republican Senator John McCain as &quot;a disingenuous film-maker&quot;. Moore laughed and waved as Republican attendees jeered, later chanting &quot;four more years&quot;. Moore gestured an L with his index finger and thumb at the crowd, which translates into &quot;loser&quot;.

During September and October 2004, Moore spoke at universities and colleges in swing states during his &quot;Slacker Uprising Tour&quot;. The tour gave away ramen and underwear to students who promised to vote. One stop during the tour was Utah Valley State College. A fight for his right to speak resulted in massive public debates and a media blitz, eventually resulting in a lawsuit against the college and the resignation of at least one member of the college&#x27;s student government. The Utah event was chronicled in the documentary film &quot;This Divided State&quot;.
Moore urged Ralph Nader not to run in 2004 so as not to split the left vote. On &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, Moore and Bill Maher knelt before Nader to plead with him to stay out of the race.

Moore drew attention in 2004 when he used the term &quot;deserter&quot; to describe then president George W. Bush while introducing Retired Army Gen. Wesley K. Clark at a Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire. Noting that Clark had been a champion debater at West Point, Moore told a laughing crowd, &quot;I know what you&#x27;re thinking. I want to see that debate&quot; between Clark and Bush – &quot;the general versus the deserter&quot;. Moore said he was referring to published reports in several media outlets including &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; which had reported that &quot;there is strong evidence that Bush performed no military service as required when he moved from Houston to Alabama to work on a U.S. Senate campaign from May to November 1972.&quot;

In 2007, Moore became a contributing journalist at &quot;OpEdNews&quot;, and by May 2014, had authored over 70 articles published on their website. Moore was an active supporter of the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York City and spoke with the OWS protesters on September 26, 2011. On October 29, 2011, he spoke at the Occupy Oakland protest site to express his support.

Moore praised &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, tweeting that the movie &quot;is one of the best film satires ever. A rare American movie on slavery and the origins of our sick racist history.&quot;
Moore&#x27;s 2011 claims that &quot;Four hundred obscenely wealthy individuals, 400 little Mubaraks – most of whom benefited in some way from the multi-trillion-dollar taxpayer bailout of 2008 – now have more cash, stock and property than the assets of 155 million Americans combined&quot; and that these 400 Americans &quot;have more wealth than half of all Americans combined&quot; was found to be true by PolitiFact and others.

After Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez died in March 2013, Moore praised him for &quot;eliminating 75 percent of extreme poverty&quot; while &quot;[providing] free health and education for all&quot;.

=== 2000 presidential election ===
Moore supported Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election. Moore was critical of Al Gore and George W. Bush. Moore criticizes Gore for the loss of thousands of jobs during his time as vice president, voting to confirm Antonin Scalia, proposing more funding for the Pentagon, and proposing to expand the War on Drugs. Moore reportedly told Bush &quot;Your possible victory on Tuesday is a threat to our national security&quot;. Moore also called Bush &quot;a banal, despicable, and corrupt human being&quot;.

=== Barack Obama ===
On April 21, 2008, Moore endorsed Barack Obama for president, stating that Hillary Clinton&#x27;s recent actions had been &quot;disgusting&quot;. Moore criticized the 2011 military intervention in Libya. After the US troops launched 110 Tomahawk missiles at military targets in Libya, Moore suggested that President Barack Obama should return his Nobel Peace Prize and tweeted in his official Twitter account, &quot;May I suggest a 50-mile evacuation zone around Obama&#x27;s Nobel Peace Prize?&quot;

==== Criticism of Obamacare and support for a single-payer model ====
In an op-ed piece for &quot;The New York Times&quot; published on December 31, 2013, Moore assessed the Affordable Care Act, calling it &quot;awful&quot; and adding that &quot;Obamacare&#x27;s rocky start ... is a result of one fatal flaw: The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go.&quot; Despite his strong critique, however, Moore wrote that he still considers the plan a &quot;godsend&quot; because it provides a start &quot;to get what we deserve: universal quality health care.&quot;

=== 2016 Presidential election ===

==== Support for Bernie Sanders ====
In December 2015, Moore announced his support for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 United States presidential election. Moore called Sanders a &quot;force to contend with&quot;. In January 2016, he officially endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. He also described democratic socialism as &quot;a true democracy where everyone has a seat at the table, everyone has a voice, not just the rich&quot;. After Sanders lost the 2016 primaries, Moore urged Americans to vote for Clinton while also correctly predicting that Trump would win the election because the post-industrial Midwestern states would vote for Trump. After Trump was elected, Moore called Trump a &quot;Russian traitor&quot;, saying his presidency had &quot;no legitimacy&quot;.

==== Other developments ====
In October 2016, Moore criticized Julian Assange and WikiLeaks for publishing leaks from the DNC&#x27;s emails, saying: &quot;I think WikiLeaks and I think Assange, they&#x27;re essentially anarchists and they know, just like a lot of people voting for Trump know, that he&#x27;s their human Molotov cocktail and they want to blow up the system. It&#x27;s an anarchic move.&quot;

In November 2016, right after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, and inspired by Bertram Gross&#x27;s 1980 book, &quot;Friendly Fascism&quot;, Moore reportedly stated: &quot;The next wave of fascists will not come with cattle cars and concentration camps, but they&#x27;ll come with a smiley face and maybe a TV show ... That&#x27;s how the 21st-century fascists will essentially take over.&quot; On November 12, 2016, Moore participated in a NYC anti-Trump rally which was later (in 2018) alleged to have been organized by Russians who were indicted by Robert Mueller for meddling in the 2016 election.

=== Donald Trump ===
==== Trumpileaks ====

Moore started the website TrumpiLeaks in May 2017, to encourage whistleblowers to provide information about Donald Trump. Moore was inspired to create the site after witnessing the firings by Trump of three law enforcement officials, specifically: United States Attorney Preet Bharara, former acting United States Attorney General Sally Yates, and former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation James Comey. Moore posted a message to his personal website, explaining the motivation of the new venture and that he wanted any information related to: &quot;crimes, breaches of public trust and misconduct committed by Donald J. Trump and his associates&quot;. He asserted, &quot;Trump thinks he&#x27;s above the law&quot;. Moore stated it was his view that Trump had engaged in obstruction of justice, falsehoods to the United States citizenry, promoted violent behavior, and violated the Constitution of the United States.

==== Criticism of corporate media ====
In March 2018, Moore criticized the &quot;corporate media&quot;, saying &quot;You turn on the TV, and it&#x27;s &#x27;Russia, Russia, Russia!&#x27; These are all shiny keys to distract us. We should know about the West Virginia strike. What an inspiration that would be. But they don&#x27;t show this&quot;.

==== Calls for Trump&#x27;s impeachment ====
In April 2018, Moore taunted Trump by ironically asking him why he had not already fired Robert Mueller. After the Russia–United States summit of July 2018, Moore called for Trump&#x27;s impeachment, saying &quot;Congress needs no more proof than Trump&#x27;s admission yesterday that he sides with Putin to impeach and remove him.&quot;

Moore compared Trump to Nazi Germany&#x27;s dictator Adolf Hitler. On August 10, 2019, Moore tweeted: &quot;I guess they think a country dumb enough to elect Trump is stupid enough to believe Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide.&quot;

==== Further support for Bernie Sanders ====
In October 2019, he announced his political endorsement of Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. After Sanders lost the primaries, Moore urged Sanders supporters to vote for Joe Biden in the general election.

==Personal life==
Moore met Kathleen Glynn&lt;ref name=&quot;mlive/2014/07/moore_divorce_final&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at the &quot;Flint Voice&quot;, and they married on October 19, 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday/77340806&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He filed for divorce on June 17, 2013. On July 22, 2014, the divorce was finalized.

Moore was raised a Catholic, but has differed with some of the traditional church teaching on subjects such as abortion and same-sex marriage. In an interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, when asked if there was a God, he stated, &quot;Yes, there is. I don&#x27;t know how you define that, but yeah.&quot;

Following the Columbine High School massacre, Moore acquired a lifetime membership to the National Rifle Association of America (NRA). Moore said that he initially intended to become the NRA&#x27;s president to dismantle the organization, but he soon dismissed the plan as too difficult. Gun rights supporters such as Dave Kopel said there was no chance of that happening; David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke wrote that Moore failed to discover that the NRA selects a president not by membership vote but by a vote of the board of directors.

In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; named Moore one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people. Later in 2005, Moore founded the Traverse City Film Festival held annually in Traverse City, Michigan. In 2009, he co-founded the Traverse City Comedy Festival, also held annually in Traverse City, where Moore helped to spearhead the renovation of the historic downtown State Theater.

== Criticism ==
Christopher Hitchens, a fervent supporter of the Iraq War, described the film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; as &quot;utterly propagandistic&quot;. In an article titled &quot;The lies of Michael Moore&quot; Hitchens rebuked Moore and his film for its contradictions and promotion of falsehoods. He also criticized Moore for his belief that Osama bin Laden should be considered innocent until proven guilty despite having taken credit for the September 11 attacks. Former Democratic mayor of New York City Ed Koch, who had endorsed Bush for re-election, wrote an op-ed in which he described Moore&#x27;s film as propaganda. Koch further maintained that &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was replete with &quot;blatant lies&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said that &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; was &quot;filled with so many inaccuracies and distortions that it ought to be classed as a work of fiction.&quot; The &quot;Boston Review&quot; said the film contained &quot;deliberate falsehoods&quot;, highlighting an interview in which Moore selectively edited and rearranged an interview with NRA president Charlton Heston to &quot;create the stupid, callous white guy he attacks.&quot;

In 2009, Moore faced criticism for using non-union workers to produce his film &quot;Capitalism: A Love Story&quot;. After his 2014 divorce, Moore was reported to have nine homes and a net worth of $50 million. Aaron Foley, writing in &quot;Jalopnik&quot;, accused Moore of hypocrisy due to his anti-capitalist views.

In a review of &quot;Fahrenheit 11/9&quot;, a film critiquing Donald Trump, John Anderson wrote &quot;Almost the entire movie is lifted from other sources, and then edited in a way that makes his enemies (do they know they&#x27;re his enemies?) look as foolish as possible. ... Mr. Moore can&#x27;t help himself, he uses footage of Adolf Hitler lip-syncing a Trump speech. Much has been made of Mr. Trump&#x27;s questionable maturity. He has a kindred spirit in Michael Moore&quot;.

Conservative author Douglas Murray criticized Moore for stating that &quot;Every problem in the world, look at it and behind it you&#x27;ve got white men&quot;. In response to his comments Murray said, &quot;Michael Moore is one of those who doesn&#x27;t realize that other people have agency and can muck up the world and their own countries in their own ways, and he&#x27;s obviously never heard of numerous countries, including North Korea&quot;.

After the killing of Brian Thompson, former CEO of UnitedHealth Group, &quot;Reason&quot; wrote:Eliding the question of whether it&#x27;s appropriate to murder an apparently random executive as a synecdoche of the entire health insurance industry, Moore merely says the anger felt by Mangione and others is &quot;1000% justified&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m not going to tamp it down or ask people to shut up. I want to pour gasoline on that anger.&quot; The alleged shooter of Thompson was found to have had in his possession at the time of being captured by law enforcement, a document in which the shooter cited two people, Moore and Elisabeth Rosenthal, as those who had &quot;illuminated the corruption and greed&quot; of the healthcare/health insurance industry.

<doc id="74478" wikidata="Q515716" url="?curid=74478" title="Prefecture">
<text>A prefecture (from the Latin word, &quot;praefectura&quot;) is an administrative jurisdiction traditionally governed by an appointed prefect. This can be a regional or local government subdivision in various countries, or a subdivision in certain international church structures. During the antiquity, it was the name of a type of Roman district. In the 21st century, the term prefecture is used for the modern first-level subdivisions of the Central African Republic, Japan, and Morocco.

==Literal prefectures==
===Antiquity===
&quot;Prefecture&quot; originally refers to a self-governing body or area in the Roman Empire since the tetrarchy, when Emperor Diocletian divided the Empire into four districts (each further divided into dioceses), grouped under a &quot;Vicarius&quot; (a number of Roman provinces, listed under that article). Diocletian also maintained two pretorian prefectures as an administrative level above the dioceses (a few of which were split).

===Ecclesiastic===

As Catholic canon law is strongly inspired by Roman law, it is not surprising that the Catholic Church has several offices under a prefect. That term occurs also in otherwise styled offices, such as the head of a congregation or department of the Roman Curia. Various ecclesiastical areas, too small for a diocese, are termed prefects.

==Analogous prefectures==
=== Brazilian equivalent of &quot;prefecture&quot;===
In Brazil, the prefecture ( or in Portuguese) is the executive branch of the government of each Brazilian municipality ( in Portuguese). The term also refers to the office of the mayor ( in Portuguese).

===Central African Republic===
The Central African Republic is divided into twenty prefectures.

===Greek equivalent of &quot;prefecture&quot;===

From 1836 until 2011, modern Greece was divided into (, singular , ) which formed the country&#x27;s main administrative units. These are most commonly translated into English as &quot;prefectures&quot; or &quot;counties&quot;.

Each was headed by a prefect (, ), who was a ministerial appointee until ca. 1990, but was then elected by direct popular vote in a process of decentralization that saw the prefectures become local government units. Municipal elections in Greece are held every four years and voting for the election of prefects and mayors was carried out concurrently but with separate ballots.

The 2010 Kallikratis plan, which took effect on 1 January 2011, abolished the prefectures as separate administrative units, and transformed them into regional units within the country&#x27;s thirteen administrative regions.

===Chinese equivalents of &quot;prefecture&quot;===
====The ancient sense====
;Xian ()

When used in the context of Chinese history, especially China before the Tang dynasty, the word &quot;prefecture&quot; is used to translate &quot;xian&quot; (). This unit of administration is translated as &quot;county&quot; when used in a contemporary context, because of the increase of the number of &quot;xian&quot; and the decrease of their sizes over time in the Chinese history.

;Zhou () or Fu () 

In the context of Chinese history during or after the Tang dynasty, the word &quot;prefecture&quot; is used to translate &quot;zhou&quot; (Wade–Giles &quot;chou&quot; (), another ancient unit of administration in China, equivalent to the modern &quot;province&quot;.

==== The modern sense ====
In modern-day China, the prefecture (; pinyin: ) is an administrative division found in the second level of the administrative hierarchy. In addition to prefectures, this level also includes autonomous prefectures, leagues, and prefecture-level cities. The prefecture level comes under the province level, and in turn oversees the county level.

===Italian &quot;prefettura&quot;===
In Italy a &quot;prefettura&quot; is the office of a &quot;prefetto&quot;, the representative of the Government in each province.

===French &quot;préfecture&quot;===

In France, a &quot;préfecture&quot; is the capital city of a department, and by metonymy also designates the office and residence of the prefect. As there are 101 departments in France, there are 101 prefectures. A &quot;préfecture de région&quot; is the capital city of an administrative region. This is the city where the prefect – the appointed government representative – resides.

===Japanese sense of &quot;prefecture&quot;===
In English, &quot;prefecture&quot; is used as the translation for , which are the main subdivisions of Japan. They consist of 43 prefectures (県 ken) proper, two urban prefectures (府 fu, Osaka and Kyoto), one &quot;circuit&quot; or &quot;territory&quot; (道 dō, Hokkaido) and one &quot;metropolis&quot; (都 to, Tokyo). Before the end of World War II, the word was also used for overseas areas 庁 (chō)、州 (shu) and 道 (dō, in Korea).

===Korean equivalents of &quot;prefecture&quot;===
Until 1894 () was the lowest level administrative division in Korea and can be translated into &quot;Petty Prefecture&quot; in the modern sense. It was below (, ; &quot;county&quot;) in the administrative hierarchy.

 () was a higher level administrative division and can be translated into &quot;Protectorate General&quot;, &quot;Greater Prefecture&quot;, &quot;Metropolitan Prefecture&quot;, or &quot;Martial Prefecture&quot; in the modern sense. The capital, Hanyang (Seoul), can sometimes be translated as &quot;Hanseong Prefecture&quot;.

In 1895, and divisions were abolished. From 1910 to 1949, the term &quot;prefecture&quot; was used to translate (). Since 1949 neither nor have been used, and there has been no division in either the South Korean or North Korean administrative system which translates as &quot;prefecture&quot;.

===Mongolian equivalent===
Mongolian prefectures (Aimags) were adopted during Qing dynasty&#x27;s rule. Today these are usually translated as &quot;provinces&quot;.

===Moroccan &quot;Préfecture&quot;===

In Morocco, the 75 second-level administrative subdivisions are 13 prefectures and 62 provinces. They are subdivisions of the 12 regions of Morocco. Each prefecture and province are subdivided in their turn into districts (&quot;cercles&quot;, sing. &quot;cercle&quot;), municipalities (&quot;communes&quot;, sing. &quot;commune&quot;) or urban municipalities (&quot;communes urbaines&quot;, sing. &quot;commune urbaine&quot;), and &quot;arrondissements&quot; in some metropolitan areas.

===Romanian &quot;prefectură&quot;===
===Venezuelan equivalent===
Traditionally, the term prefecture referred to a City Hall and the prefect was the equivalent of a mayor and commissioner. After recent changes, the prefectures and prefects are analogous with the figure of Town Clerk.

<text>In France, a prefecture (, ) may be:
* the , the commune in which the administration of a department is located;
* the , the commune in which the administration of a region is located;
* the jurisdiction of a prefecture;
* the official residence or headquarters of a prefect.

Although the administration of departments and regions is distinct, a regional prefect is &quot;ex officio&quot; prefect of the department in which the regional prefecture is located. The officeholder has authority upon the other prefects in the region on a range of matters.

==Role of the prefecture ==
There are 101 prefectures in France, one for each department. The official in charge is the prefect (). The prefecture is an administration that belongs to the Ministry of the Interior; it is therefore in charge of the delivery of identity cards, driving licenses, passports, residency and work permits for foreigners, vehicle registration, registration of associations (creation, status modification, dissolution), as well as of the management of the National Police and firefighters, although as of 2018, 79% of firefighters in France are part-time volunteers.

Prefectures are usually located near the geographic centre of their departments; they were originally chosen for being within a day&#x27;s travel on horseback from anywhere in the department. Therefore, the largest settlement in a department may not always be its prefecture: the department of Marne, for example, has its prefecture at Châlons-en-Champagne despite the city of Reims, near the Aisne border, being four times its size.

The prefect represents the national government at the local level and as such exercises the powers that are constitutionally attributed to the national government. The prefect issues ordinances written for the application of local law: to close a building that does not conform to safety codes, or modify vehicular traffic regulations (speed limit, construction permits).

The governing body of the department is the departmental council (), which is elected through a system of cantons. It is in charge of the building and maintenance of middle schools (&quot;collèges&quot;) and departmental roads, financial assistance to dependent people (disabled and elderly), as well as promotion of local economic development, amongst other matters. In the past, the prefect was head of the department, but since 1982, the President of the Departmental Council has assumed the role of chief executive of the department.

==Parisian exception==
There is an exception in Paris in the Île-de-France region and its three surrounding departments, known as the Petite Couronne (&quot;Small Crown&quot;): Hauts-de-Seine to the west, Seine-Saint-Denis to the northeast and Val-de-Marne to the southeast. These departments are administered by an additional separate unitary prefecture for law enforcement and security purposes, a Prefecture of Police (), known as the Paris Police Prefecture, a situation inherited from the Paris Commune of 1871. The power of law enforcement is usually vested in the mayor in other communes. This power is held by the Prefect of Police of Paris in the Petite Couronne.

In 2012, a similar structure was established in Bouches-du-Rhône, the Bouches-du-Rhône Police Prefecture, headed by the Prefect of Police of Bouches-du-Rhône, although it is formally less independent than that of Paris.

==Divisions of departments==
Departments are divided into arrondissements, themselves divided into cantons. The &quot;chef-lieu d&#x27;arrondissement&quot; is the subprefecture (). The official in charge is the subprefect (). There are relatively few competences associated to cantons, the most important one being the local organisation of elections, as cantons are electoral subdivisions.

<text>Japan is divided into 47 prefectures (, , ), which rank immediately below the national government and form the country&#x27;s first level of jurisdiction and administrative division. They include 43 prefectures proper (, &quot;ken&quot;), two urban prefectures (, &quot;fu&quot;: Osaka and Kyoto), one regional prefecture (, &quot;dō&quot;: Hokkaidō) and one metropolis (, &quot;to&quot;: Tokyo). 
In 1868, the Meiji &quot;Fuhanken sanchisei&quot; administration created the first prefectures (urban &quot;fu&quot; and rural &quot;ken&quot;) to replace the urban and rural administrators (&quot;bugyō&quot;, &quot;daikan&quot;, etc.) in the parts of the country previously controlled directly by the shogunate and a few territories of rebels/shogunate loyalists who had not submitted to the new government such as Aizu/Wakamatsu. In 1871, all remaining feudal domains &quot;(han)&quot; were also transformed into prefectures, so that prefectures subdivided the whole country. In several waves of territorial consolidation, today&#x27;s 47 prefectures were formed by the turn of the century. In many instances, these are contiguous with the ancient ritsuryō provinces of Japan.

Each prefecture&#x27;s chief executive is a directly elected . Ordinances and budgets are enacted by a unicameral whose members are elected for four-year terms.

Under a set of 1888–1890 laws on local government until the 1920s, each prefecture (then only 3 &quot;-fu&quot; and 42 &quot;-ken&quot;; &quot;Hokkaidō&quot; and &quot;Okinawa-ken&quot; were subject to different laws until the 20th century) was subdivided into and and each district into and . Hokkaidō has 14 subprefectures that act as and of the prefecture. Some other prefectures also have branch offices that carry out prefectural administrative functions outside the capital. Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is a merged city-prefecture; a metropolis, it has features of both cities and prefectures.

Each prefecture has its own mon for identification, the equivalent of a coat of arms in the West.

== Background ==
The West&#x27;s use of &quot;prefecture&quot; to label these Japanese regions stems from 16th-century Portuguese explorers and traders use of &quot;prefeitura&quot; to describe the fiefdoms they encountered there. Its original sense in Portuguese, however, was closer to &quot;municipality&quot; than &quot;province&quot;. Today, in turn, Japan uses its word &quot;ken&quot; (), meaning &quot;prefecture&quot;, to identify Portuguese districts while in Brazil the word &quot;Prefeitura&quot; is used to refer to a city hall.

Those fiefs were headed by a local warlord or family. Though the fiefs have long since been dismantled, merged, and reorganized multiple times, and been granted legislative governance and oversight, the rough translation stuck.

The Meiji government established the current system in July 1871 with the abolition of the han system and establishment of the . Although there were initially over 300 prefectures, many of them being former han territories, this number was reduced to 72 in the latter part of 1871, and 47 in 1888. The Local Autonomy Law of 1947 gave more political power to prefectures, and installed prefectural governors and parliaments.

In 2003, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi proposed that the government consolidate the current prefectures into about 10 regional states (so-called &quot;dōshūsei&quot;). The plan called for each region to have greater autonomy than existing prefectures. This process would reduce the number of subprefecture administrative regions and cut administrative costs. The Japanese government also considered a plan to merge several groups of prefectures, creating a subnational administrative division system consisting of between nine and 13 states, and giving these states more local autonomy than the prefectures currently enjoy. As of August 2012, this plan was abandoned.

== Powers ==

Japan is a unitary state. The central government delegates many functions (such as education and the police force) to the prefectures and municipalities, but retains the overall right to control them. Although local government expenditure accounts for 70 percent of overall government expenditure, the central government controls local budgets, tax rates, and borrowing.

Prefectural government functions include the organization of the prefectural police force, the supervision of schools and the maintenance of prefectural schools (mainly high schools), prefectural hospitals, prefectural roads, the supervision of prefectural waterways and regional urban planning. Their responsibilities include tasks delegated to them by the national government such as maintaining most ordinary national roads (except in designated major cities), and prefectures coordinate and support their municipalities in their functions. De facto, prefectures as well as municipalities have often been less autonomous than the formal extent of the local autonomy law suggests, because of national funding and policies. Most of municipalities depend heavily on central government funding – a dependency recently further exacerbated in many regions by the declining population which hits rural areas harder and earlier (cities can offset it partly through migration from the countryside). In many policy areas, the basic framework is set tightly by national laws, and prefectures and municipalities are only autonomous within that framework.

== Types of prefecture ==
Historically, during the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate established around the nine largest cities in Japan, and 302 elsewhere. When the Meiji government began to create the prefectural system in 1868, the nine bugyō-ruled zones became , while the township-ruled zones and the rest of the bugyō-ruled zones became . Later, in 1871, the government designated Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto as &quot;fu&quot;, and relegated the other &quot;fu&quot; to the status of &quot;ken.&quot; During World War II, in 1943, Tokyo became a &quot;to,&quot; a new type of pseudo-prefecture.

Despite the differences in terminology, there is little functional difference between the four types of local governments. The subnational governments are sometimes collectively referred to as in Japanese, which is a combination of the four terms.

===&quot;To&quot;===
Tokyo, capital city of Japan is referred to as , which is often translated as &quot;metropolis&quot;. The Japanese government translates as &quot;Tokyo Metropolis&quot; in almost all cases, and the government is officially called the &quot;Tokyo Metropolitan Government&quot;.

Following the capitulation of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868, &quot;Tōkyō-fu&quot; (an urban prefecture like Kyoto and Osaka) was set up and encompassed the former city area of Edo under the Fuhanken sanchisei. After the abolition of the han system in the first wave of prefectural mergers in 1871/72, several surrounding areas (parts of Urawa, Kosuge, Shinagawa and Hikone prefectures) were merged into Tokyo, and under the system of (numbered) &quot;large districts and small districts&quot; &quot;(daiku-shōku)&quot;, it was subdivided into eleven large districts further subdivided into 103 small districts, six of the large districts (97 small districts) covered the former city area of Edo. When the ancient ritsuryō districts were reactivated as administrative units in 1878, Tokyo was subdivided into 15 [urban] districts &quot;(-ku)&quot; and initially six [rural] districts (&quot;-gun&quot;; nine after the Tama transfer from Kanagawa in 1893, eight after the merger of East Tama and South Toshima into Toyotama in 1896). Both urban and rural districts, like everywhere in the country, were further subdivided into urban units/towns/neighbourhoods &quot;(-chō/-machi)&quot; and rural units/villages &quot;(-mura/-son)&quot;. The yet unincorporated communities on the Izu (previously part of Shizuoka) and Ogasawara (previously directly Home Ministry-administrated) island groups became also part of Tokyo in the 19th century. When the modern municipalities – [district-independent] cities and [rural] districts containing towns and villages – were introduced under the Yamagata-Mosse laws on local government and the simultaneous Great Meiji merger was performed in 1889, the 15 &quot;-ku&quot; became wards of Tokyo City, initially Tokyo&#x27;s only independent city &quot;(-shi)&quot;, the six rural districts of Tokyo were consolidated in 85 towns and villages. In 1893, the three Tama districts and their 91 towns and villages became part of Tokyo. As Tokyo city&#x27;s suburbs grew rapidly in the early 20th century, many towns and villages in Tokyo were merged or promoted over the years. In 1932, five complete districts with their 82 towns and villages were merged into Tokyo City and organised in 20 new wards. Also, by 1940, there were two more cities in Tokyo: Hachiōji City and Tachikawa City.

In 1943, Tokyo City was abolished, &quot;Tōkyō-fu&quot; became &quot;Tōkyō-to&quot;, and Tokyo-shi&#x27;s 35 wards remained Tokyo-to&#x27;s 35 wards, but submunicipal authorities of Tokyo-shi&#x27;s wards which previously fell directly under the municipality, with the municipality now abolished, fell directly under prefectural or now &quot;Metropolitan&quot; authority. All other cities, towns and villages in Tokyo-fu stayed cities, towns and villages in Tokyo-to. The reorganisation&#x27;s aim was to consolidate the administration of the area around the capital by eliminating the extra level of authority in Tokyo. Also, the governor was no longer called &quot;chiji&quot;, but &quot;chōkan&quot; (~&quot;head/chief [usually: of a central government agency]&quot;) as in Hokkaidō). The central government wanted to have greater control over all local governments due to Japan&#x27;s deteriorating position in World War II – for example, all mayors in the country became appointive as in the Meiji era – and over Tokyo in particular, due to the possibility of emergency in the metropolis.

After the war, Japan was forced to decentralise Tokyo again, following the general terms of democratisation outlined in the Potsdam Declaration. Many of Tokyo&#x27;s special governmental characteristics disappeared during this time, and the wards took on an increasingly municipal status in the decades following the surrender. Administratively, today&#x27;s special wards are almost indistinguishable from other municipalities.

The postwar reforms also changed the map of Tokyo significantly: In 1947, the 35 wards were reorganised into the 23 special wards, because many of its citizens had either died during the war, left the city, or been drafted and did not return. In the occupation reforms, special wards, each with their own elected assemblies (&quot;kugikai&quot;) and mayors (&quot;kuchō&quot;), were intended to be equal to other municipalities even if some restrictions still applied. (For example, there was during the occupation a dedicated municipal police agency for the 23 special wards/former Tokyo City, yet the special wards public safety commission was not named by the special ward governments, but by the government of the whole &quot;Metropolis&quot;. In 1954, independent municipal police forces were abolished generally in the whole country, and the prefectural/&quot;Metropolitan&quot; police of Tokyo is again responsible for the whole prefecture/&quot;Metropolis&quot; and like all prefectural police forces controlled by the prefectural/&quot;Metropolitan&quot; public safety commission whose members are appointed by the prefectural/&quot;Metropolitan&quot; governor and assembly.) But, as part of the &quot;reverse course&quot; of the 1950s some of these new rights were removed, the most obvious measure being the denial of directly elected mayors. Some of these restrictions were removed again over the decades. But it was not until the year 2000 that the special wards were fully recognised as municipal-level entities.

Independently from these steps, as Tokyo&#x27;s urban growth again took up pace during the postwar economic miracle and most of the main island part of Tokyo &quot;Metropolis&quot; became increasingly core part of the Tokyo metropolitan area, many of the other municipalities in Tokyo have transferred some of their authority to the Metropolitan government. For example, the Tokyo Fire Department which was only responsible for the 23 special wards until 1960 has until today taken over the municipal fire departments in almost all of Tokyo. A joint governmental structure for the whole Tokyo metropolitan area (and not only the western suburbs of the special wards which are part of the Tokyo prefecture/Metropolis&quot;) as advocated by some politicians such as former Kanagawa governor Shigefumi Matsuzawa has not been established (see also Dōshūsei). Existing cross-prefectural fora of cooperation between local governments in the Tokyo metropolitan area are the Kantō regional governors&#x27; association &quot;(Kantō chihō chijikai)&quot; and the &quot;Shutoken summit&quot; (formally &quot;conference of chief executives of nine prefectures and cities&quot;, &quot;9 to-ken-shi shunō kaigi&quot;). But, these are not themselves local public entities under the local autonomy law and national or local government functions cannot be directly transferred to them, unlike the &quot;Union of Kansai governments&quot; &quot;(Kansai kōiki-rengō)&quot; which has been established by several prefectural governments in the Kansai region.

There are some differences in terminology between Tokyo and other prefectures: police and fire departments are called instead of , for instance. But the only functional difference between Tōkyō-to and other prefectures is that Tokyo administers wards as well as cities. Today, since the special wards have almost the same degree of independence as Japanese cities, the difference in administration between Tokyo and other prefectures is fairly minor.

In Osaka, several prominent politicians led by Tōru Hashimoto, then mayor of Osaka City and former governor of Osaka Prefecture, proposed an Osaka Metropolis plan, under which Osaka City, and possibly other neighboring cities, would be replaced by special wards similar to Tokyo&#x27;s. The plan was narrowly defeated in a 2015 referendum, and again in 2020.

===&quot;Dō&quot;===
Hokkaidō is referred to as a or circuit. This term was originally used to refer to Japanese regions consisting of several provinces (e.g. the Tōkaidō east-coast region, and Saikaido west-coast region). This was also a historical usage of the character in China. (In Korea, this historical usage is still used today and was kept during the period of Japanese rule.)

, the only remaining &quot;dō&quot; today, was not one of the original seven &quot;dō&quot; (it was known as Ezo in the pre-modern era). Its current name is believed to originate from Matsuura Takeshiro, an early Japanese explorer of the island. Since Hokkaidō did not fit into the existing &quot;dō&quot; classifications, a new &quot;dō&quot; was created to cover it.

The Meiji government originally classified Hokkaidō as a , and later divided the island into three prefectures (Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro). These were consolidated into a single in 1886, at prefectural level but organized more along the lines of a territory. In 1947, the department was dissolved, and Hokkaidō became a full-fledged prefecture. The &quot;-ken&quot; suffix was never added to its name, so the &quot;-dō&quot; suffix came to be understood to mean &quot;prefecture&quot;.

When Hokkaidō was incorporated, transportation on the island was still underdeveloped, so the prefecture was split into several that could fulfill administrative duties of the prefectural government and keep tight control over the developing island. These subprefectures still exist today, although they have much less power than they possessed before and during World War II. They now exist primarily to handle paperwork and other bureaucratic functions.

&quot;Hokkaidō Prefecture&quot; is, technically speaking, a redundant term because &quot;dō&quot; itself indicates a prefecture, although it is occasionally used to differentiate the government from the island itself. The prefecture&#x27;s government calls itself the &quot;Hokkaidō Government&quot; rather than the &quot;Hokkaidō Prefectural Government&quot;.

===&quot;Fu&quot;===
Osaka and Kyoto Prefectures are referred to as . The Classical Chinese character from which this is derived implies a core urban zone of national importance. Before World War II, different laws applied to &quot;fu&quot; and &quot;ken,&quot; but this distinction was abolished after the war, and the two types of prefecture are now functionally the same.

===&quot;Ken&quot;===
43 of the 47 prefectures are referred to as . The Classical Chinese character from which this is derived carries a rural or provincial connotation, and an analogous character is used to refer to the counties of China, counties of Taiwan and districts of Vietnam.

The prefectures are also often grouped into eight regions (地方, &quot;chihō&quot;). Those regions are not formally specified, they do not have elected officials, nor are they corporate bodies. But the practice of ordering prefectures based on their geographic region is traditional. This ordering is mirrored in Japan&#x27;s International Organization for Standardization (ISO) coding. From north to south (numbering in ISO 3166-2:JP order), the prefectures of Japan and their commonly associated regions are:
* Hokkaidō 
* Tōhoku 
* Kantō 
* Chūbu 
* Kansai　　 
* Chūgoku 
* Shikoku 
* Kyūshū 
* Ryūkyū Islands

<text>In Chinese mythology, the Fuzanglong () is the Chinese dragon of hidden treasures and an underworld dragon which guards buried treasure, both natural and man-made. Volcanoes are said to form when these dragons burst out of the ground to report to heaven. Several tiles and light reliefs depict Fuzanglong dragons serving as mounts to Immortals.

The Fuzanglong possesses a magic pearl which is its most treasured possession.

<text>Disney&#x27;s House of Mouse (or simply House of Mouse) is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation that originally aired on ABC and Toon Disney from January 13, 2001, to October 24, 2003, with 52 episodes and 22 newly produced cartoon shorts made for the series. The show focuses on Mickey Mouse and his friends running a cartoon theater dinner club in the fictional setting of ToonTown, catering to many characters from Disney cartoons and animated movies while showcasing a variety of their cartoon shorts. The series is named after a common nickname or epithet for the Walt Disney Company.

The animated series is a spin off of the series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, and featured many of the series&#x27; shorts as well as selection of brand new shorts, and classic Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald Duck shorts from the 1930s–50s.

During its time, the animated series held two nominations for awards, while select cast members won two awards for their performances as characters in &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. The series featured two direct-to-video films – &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse&quot; and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s House of Villains&quot; – along with an all-night marathon of the &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, aired on Toon Disney in September 2002 under the title &quot;Night of 1,000 Toons&quot;.

==Premise==

The basic premise of the show focuses on Mickey Mouse and his friends operating a dinner theater club in downtown ToonTown. Considered a popular venue by the residents, the club is frequented by a host of characters from Disney animated properties; a feature of the series is that every film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation prior to the start of the series (between and including &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;&quot;, with the exception of the CGI &quot;Dinosaur&quot;) are featured in the series. Such characters mostly appear as paying guests of the club, and would often have speaking roles, although a number sometimes operate as performers for the club. The series also includes many relatively obscure and otherwise rarely used Disney characters, often with speaking parts for the first time – for example, Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf and April, May and June, who had appeared very often in Disney comic books but never before in an animated cartoon, made their animated debuts on &quot;House of Mouse&quot;. The show also featured some cameos by characters created for other television cartoons such as &quot;Pepper Ann&quot; and theme park attractions like The Haunted Mansion, but these appearances were few and far between.

Each episode focuses on a story involving Mickey and his associates facing an issue during an evening&#x27;s operation of the club, and their efforts to overcome it – the most common plot for episodes involves the group dealing with a serious problem caused by Pete in his attempts to shut down the club and use it for his own gains. These stories, often involving farcical mishaps, tended to act as a wraparound for the cartoon shorts played in between scenes, the theme of the story contributing towards the story-lines of the cartoon shorts shown in the episode. Cartoon shorts played in episodes focused on elements from classic theatrical cartoons of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, though most were reruns from &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, and featured a simple story. Some stories were set to a specific theme for a specific character, but with differing scenarios – for example, one set focused on Mickey seeking to rescue Minnie from Pete, against a different obstacle in each short, while another set focused on Pluto&#x27;s efforts to get Mickey his paper while facing a different problem.

==Episodes==

==Voice cast==
*Mickey Mouse (voiced by Wayne Allwine): Mickey operates the club as general manager and co-owner, but leaves the club&#x27;s management to his friends. His main role in the club is hosting the evening&#x27;s entertainment as its showbiz superstar.
*Minnie Mouse (voiced by Russi Taylor): Minnie operates as the club&#x27;s show planner and bookkeeper, and is responsible for the club&#x27;s day-to-day administration. Her performance at keeping the club running well makes her a pillar of support in times of crisis, especially in keeping Mickey calm when he panics over a situation.
*Donald Duck (voiced by Tony Anselmo): Donald operates as the club&#x27;s deputy manager, responsible for the overall customer service at the club and tending to the needs of VIP guests. Although a co-owner in the club, he is envious of Mickey&#x27;s fame and position and tends to want to run the club himself, though his efforts are usually thwarted by his conscience preventing him betraying his friendship with Mickey.
*Daisy Duck (voiced by Tress MacNeille): Daisy operates as the reservation clerk for the club, but often dreams of being a star in her own right, which often sees her attempting to try out a new act in the club that often backfires.
*Goofy (voiced by Bill Farmer): Goofy operates as the head waiter, managing the club&#x27;s restaurant operations with his usual accident-prone yet genial manner of work. Despite this difficulty, Goofy manages to ensure guests receive their meals without issues.
*Pluto (voiced by Bill Farmer): Pluto operates as both the club&#x27;s mascot, and as a personal assistant to both Mickey and Minnie.
*Horace Horsecollar (voiced by Bill Farmer): Horace operates as the club&#x27;s technical engineer, in charge of the lighting, loudspeakers, and video players. A recurring gag in the animated series is his habit of literally doing as told and , and a tendency to state about what is wrong in general life, rather than specifically on something that just happened when asked.
*Clarabelle Cow (voiced by April Winchell): Clarabelle operates as the club&#x27;s gossip monger with her own show, collecting and spreading rumours about characters all over ToonTown, although her gossip tends to occasionally cause problems as a result.
*Max Goof (voiced by Jason Marsden): Max operates as the club&#x27;s valet parking attendant. He tends to enjoy his work, though a number of episodes feature stories about him debating over things he witnesses or wishes to enjoy.
*Huey, Dewey, and Louie (all voiced by Tony Anselmo): Huey, Dewey and Louie operate as the club&#x27;s house band. Throughout the course of the animated series&#x27; run, the trio operated under different names and genres of music, parodying noted music bands of the time - &quot;The Quackstreet Boys&quot;, &quot;Quackwerk&quot;, &quot;Kid Duck&quot; and &quot;The Splashing Pumpkins&quot;.
*Gus Goose (voiced by Frank Welker): Gus operates as the club&#x27;s chef, but his notorious gluttony tends to cause him to eat the food he prepares for guests before it is served.
*Magic Mirror (voiced by Tony Jay): Magic Mirror acts as the club&#x27;s on-site consultant, often providing advice when asked by Mickey and his friends, as well as answering queries about the club&#x27;s guests.
*Mic (pronounced &quot;Mike&quot;) (voiced by Rod Roddy): Mic is a talking microphone, who operates as the club&#x27;s announcer. The character is mainly involved at the beginning and end of the episodes, the latter often involving him providing a fictional advert connected to one of Disney&#x27;s characters, cartoons, or animated films.
*Pete (voiced by Jim Cummings): Commonly referred to as Bad Pete by others, is the show&#x27;s main antagonist and the club&#x27;s shady landlord. Episodes featuring him tend to involve him seeking a way to shut down the club – per a contract he made with Mickey at the start of the animated series to own the House of Mouse, the club can only be shut down if there is no show going on. His efforts to do so always backfire.

==Production==
Then vice president of Disney Television Animation at the time, Barry Blumberg, wanted to produce a series that worked as a better format for &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;. Roberts &quot;Bobs&quot; Gannaway and Tony Craig aimed to have the series reintroduce Disney characters to a new generation who were only familiar with them via marketing and &quot;homogenized theme-park figures&quot;. They wanted to avoid making Mickey Mouse &quot;hip&quot; or &quot;edgy&quot; and retain the characters&#x27; personalities as closely as possible. The series was notable in that it allowed the characters to be played with more loosely as Craig stated, &quot;Everybody thought it was really funny to loosen up a bit and let the characters be who they were and have some fun, instead of being so stiff&quot;. The crew was not allowed to use any of the characters from &quot;Tarzan&quot; due to licensing issues. Gannaway and Craig also deliberately tried to avoid using characters from &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; due to them being &quot;inherently dramatic&quot;, nevertheless, Tantor, Quasimodo and a few other characters from &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; would make a couple of cameos in the series. There were other limits for this program as well, which forbids the use of Pixar characters due to Disney not owning content from Pixar prior to 2006 and King Louie following a legal dispute. This even omits characters created for the direct-to-video sequels due to promotional problems as only allowing characters from the original source material.

The show was produced by Walt Disney Television, and originally aired from 2001 to 2003, running for 52 episodes. The show is one of many Disney cartoon series made in the widescreen HD format. Like with &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, the animation was outsourced to Toon City in the Philippines. Unlike that series, it was also outsourced to Walt Disney Animation Australia and Walt Disney Animation Japan.

The theme song is performed by Brian Setzer.

==Broadcast==
&quot;House of Mouse&quot; aired on One Saturday Morning on ABC. It reran from September 9, 2002 to February 4, 2006 on Disney Channel. The show ceased broadcast on U.S. television on February 6, 2009, after being aired for the last time on Toon Disney before becoming Disney XD.

==Reception==

=== Critical response ===
Noah Bell of &quot;Collider&quot; stated, &quot;For Disney fans growing up in the 2000s, &quot;House of Mouse&quot; was like a dream brought to life. Taking place primarily in a dinner club owned by Mickey, the show featured characters from virtually every Disney film made at that point interacting on a scale never seen before or since. With people&#x27;s love of crossovers only growing since the series ended, an updated &quot;House of Mouse&quot; could have a lot going for it.&quot; Gabriel Stanford-Reisinger of &quot;FanSided&quot; asserted, &quot;While it didn&#x27;t last as long as others, it proved to be a fan-favorite.&quot;

Rafael Sarmiento of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked &quot;House of Mouse&quot; fourteenth in their &quot;15 Best Kid&#x27;s Cartoons Of The 2000s&quot; list, writing, &quot;&quot;House of Mouse&quot; is among the best cartoons of the 2000s for exemplifying just how fun the era was for Disney cartoons.&quot; Max Spirenkov of &quot;Looper&quot; ranked &quot;House of Mouse&quot; twentieth in their &quot;50 Best Kids Shows Of The 2000s&quot; list, saying, &quot;Longtime fans of Disney films will absolutely adore this series, as Mickey winds up being the host to just about every character you could ask for throughout Disney cinema history. If hosting one of the biggest crossovers in television wasn&#x27;t enough, the comical nature of the show provides a new angle to many iconic characters from older films, especially in its portrayal of some of the most notable villains over the years.&quot;

<text>Arthur Floyd Gottfredson (May 5, 1905July 22, 1986) was an American cartoonist best known for his defining work on the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip, which he worked on from 1930 until his retirement in 1975. His contribution to Mickey Mouse comics is comparable to Carl Barks&#x27;s on the Donald Duck comics. 17 years after his death, his memory was honored with the Disney Legends award in 2003 and induction into the Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Gottfredson was born into a large family of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Kaysville, Utah, in 1905. As a child, Floyd severely injured his arm in a hunting accident. Housebound during a long recovery, he became interested in cartooning and took several cartooning correspondence courses. Because of his injury, Gottfredson had to draw using his whole arm. In 1926, he took the Federal Schools of Illustrating and Cartooning&#x27;s correspondence course, and by the late 1920s, he was drawing cartoons for trade magazines and the &quot;Salt Lake City Telegram&quot; newspaper.

After achieving second place in a 1928 cartoon contest, the 23-year-old Gottfredson moved to Southern California with his wife and family, just before Christmas. At the time, there were seven major newspapers in the area, but he was unable to find work with any. One job he had held in Utah, however, was as a movie projectionist and he found employment in that field in California. A year later, the movie theater where he had been working was torn down, resulting in another job search. On a whim, Gottfredson inquired at Disney studios, which hired him the same day.

===Mickey Mouse===
Walt Disney Productions hired Gottfredson as an apprentice animator and in-betweener on December 19, 1929. In April 1930, he started working on the four-month-old &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; daily comic strip. It had originally been scripted by Walt Disney and drawn by Ub Iwerks who was succeeded by Win Smith. Iwerks later left Disney and tried to hire Gottfredson, but Roy Disney refused to allow Gottfredson out of his contract. In May, Win Smith refused to write the strip, and Disney assigned Gottfredson to it, promising it would be only a temporary arrangement until someone else could be found to take over. Gottfredson continued to produce the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; strips for the next 45 years.

Gottfredson&#x27;s first daily strip was published in newspapers on his 25th birthday, May 5, 1930. In January 1932, he began work on the newly inaugurated &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; color Sunday strip which, in addition to the daily, he continued through mid-1938. Gottfredson headed the comics department at Disney from 1930 to 1946, and was replaced by Frank Reilly.

Originally, Gottfredson wrote and drew the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; strip alone, but in 1932, he pulled back to plotting the stories and doing the penciling, while the dialogue was mostly done by other hands. Scripts were written by Webb Smith (1932–33), Ted Osborne (1933–38), Merrill De Maris (1933–42), Dick Shaw (1942–43), Bill Walsh (1943–64), Roy Williams (1962-69) and Del Connell (1968–88). Even so, Gottfredson always worked closely with his writers, and would often suggest changes in the scripts whenever he thought it would improve a story. There were a variety of inkers on the strip through the years; inkers for the Sunday strips included Al Taliaferro and Ted Thwaites in the 1930s, and Manuel Gonzales until 1981; Taliaferro also inked daily strips. Gottfredson returned to inking daily strips himself in 1947.

From the beginning, the strips were parts of long continuing stories. These introduced characters such as the Phantom Blot, Eega Beeva, and the Bat Bandit, which Gottfredson created; Disney created Eli Squinch, Mickey&#x27;s nephews, Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse, and Sylvester Shyster, who were also introduced in the comic. Gottfredson plotted the continuities until Bill Walsh started writing the strip in 1943. The stories were always untitled. Titles were usually assigned later, when the strips or pages were reprinted in picture-books or comic books, which the artists had no influence on. Starting in the 1950s, Gottfredson and writer Bill Walsh were instructed to drop the storylines and do only daily gags. Gottfredson continued illustrating the daily strip until he retired on October 1, 1975.

Animation critic Geoffrey Blum said &quot;Gottfredson&#x27;s Mormon upbringing and his unflaggingly positive outlook made him the perfect keeper for this icon. Never complaining, chocking back his hurts... this is the ethic he brought to Mickey. Gottfredson&#x27;s mouse combines the virtues of a good citizen and a good soldier.&quot;

==Reprints and compilations==
Gottfredson&#x27;s Mickey strips were often collected in the 1930s and 1940s. Western Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Big Little Book&quot; series based most of its Mickey volumes on the strip; Dell Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; serialized stories from the strip through 1948.

Modern-day American reprints began with &quot;The Bar None Ranch&quot; (1940), which appeared in &quot;Walt Disney Comics Digest&quot; #40 (1973). The following year &quot;The Bat Bandit&quot; (1934) appeared in a deluxe edition, &quot;The Best of Walt Disney Comics&quot;. Abbeville Press&#x27; large size &quot;Best Comics&quot; anthologies in the late-1970s included two all-Gottfredson volumes (one headlined &quot;Goofy&quot;), though the stories were relettered and sometimes condensed. In 1980, Abbeville issued a small-size &quot;Best Comics&quot; series that included three all-Gottfredson volumes (again, one headlined &quot;Goofy&quot;), all of which reprinted stories from the earlier large-size editions. In 1986, Another Rainbow/Gladstone Publishing (and later Gemstone Publishing) began a tradition of serializing Gottfredson stories in regular Disney monthly comic books, which continued on and off until 2008, when they ceased publication. Gladstone also collected a number of Gottfredson&#x27;s serials in the larger-size &quot;comic albums&quot; it issued during the 1980s; in 1990, Disney Comics issued &quot;Mickey Mouse Outwits the Phantom Blot&quot; (1939) in the same format.

In 2007, Gemstone Publishing announced &quot;The Floyd Gottfredson Library&quot;, a comprehensive edition of Gottfredson&#x27;s serialized stories (Mickey 1930–1955, plus later non-Mickey material). The series was postponed, then canceled once Gemstone no longer had the Disney license. In 2011, Fantagraphics Books resumed production of the series with the same editorial team, now titled &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse&quot;. A total of 14 volumes were published between 2011 and 2018, collecting the entirety of Gottfredson&#x27;s Sunday color work (two volumes) and all of his serialized daily strips (12 volumes).

==Legacy==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, before his health deteriorated, Gottfredson gave interviews to many comics-oriented magazines as well as mainstream publications. The deluxe edition of the book &quot;Mickey Mouse in Color&quot; included a small record containing an audio interview with Gottfredson and Disney Donald Duck-comic book artist Carl Barks. During the 1970s, Gottfredson attended the OrlandoCon and in 1983 the San Diego Comic Book convention and annual convention of The Mouse Club.

Between 1978 and 1983, Gottfredson did a total of 24 paintings commissioned by collector Malcolm Willits, inspired by the success of the paintings of the Disney ducks done by Carl Barks. The paintings depict various storylines from the classic period of the Mickey strip.

Gottfredson&#x27;s work had been printed in newspapers, magazines, and comic books worldwide for over 50 years, but as a Disney employee, he was never allowed to sign it. Gottfredson&#x27;s identity was finally revealed in the mid-1960s by fan Malcolm Willits. Subsequently, reprints of his &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; strips in the 1970s gave him credit.

Floyd Gottfredson died at his home in Southern California at the age of 81. In 2006, Gottfredson was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards&#x27; Hall of Fame. He also was awarded an Inkpot Award in 1983.

Fellow Disney Legend Floyd Norman notes the drawing desk Gottfredson used today &quot;occupies a corner in a special room at Disney&#x27;s Publishing department in Burbank.&quot;

<text>The Alice Comedies are a series of live-action animated shorts created by Walt Disney in the 1920s, in which a live action little girl named Alice (originally played by Virginia Davis) and an animated cat named Julius have adventures in an animated landscape. The shorts were the first work by what ultimately became The Walt Disney Company.

==&quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;==
Disney, Ub Iwerks, and their staff made the first &quot;Alice Comedy&quot;, a one-reel (ten-minute) 1923 short subject titled &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;, while still heading the failing Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri.

&quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; begins with Alice entering a cartoon studio to witness cartoons being created. Alice is amazed by what she sees: the cartoon characters come to life and play around. After heading to bed that night, she dreams of being in the cartoon world, welcomed by all of the characters. Alice plays with them until a group of lions break free from a cage and chase her. Though never released, this short helped set the stage for what was to come in the later &quot;Alice Comedies&quot;, as it established the world as a playful dream and also introduced the elements which would soon define the series. The idea of setting a real-world girl in an animated world was at this point in film history still unique. The design and voice of the later series were all set by this original film.

==The &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; series begins==

After completing the film, the studio went bankrupt and was forced to shut down. After raising money by working as a freelance photographer, Disney bought a one-way train ticket to Los Angeles, California to live with his uncle Robert and his brother Roy. In California, Disney continued to send out proposals for the &quot;Alice&quot; series, in hopes of obtaining a distribution agreement. A deal was finally arranged through Winkler Pictures, run by Margaret Winkler and her fiancé, Charles Mintz. Because of a recent falling out with Pat Sullivan, the studio needed a quick replacement for their centerpiece Felix the Cat animated series. Disney convinced Davis&#x27;s family to bring her from Missouri to Los Angeles to star in the series.

==Shorts and subsequent releases==
Walt Disney both directed and produced all 57 films in this series. Animation was done by Walt Disney, sometimes assisted by Rollin &quot;Ham&quot; Hamilton. Over the course of the series, four actresses played Alice: Virginia Davis (15), Margie Gay (31), Dawn O&#x27;Day (1) and Lois Hardwick (10). The film &quot;Alice in the Jungle&quot; contains only archival footage of Virginia Davis.

The shorts in this series are now all in the public domain in the United States. In 2000, Inkwell Images released &quot;Alice in Cartoonland – The Original Alice Comedies by Walt Disney&quot; in VHS, and in 2007 in DVD as part of the &quot;Golden Classics&quot; series with ten of the films as well as a documentary, poster gallery, and DVD ROM. In 2007, Kit Parker Films released another DVD called &quot;Alice in Cartoonland: The 35mm Collector&#x27;s Set&quot;. In 2005 and again in 2007, ten shorts in the series were released as part of the &quot;Walt Disney Treasures&quot; series. Seven were part of the &quot;Disney Rarities&quot; that was released in 2005, while three more were released as part of &quot;The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot;, released in 2007.

In 2016, &quot;Alice&quot; shorts held by the EYE Film Institute in Amsterdam were restored for global re-release.

A total of 16 &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; shorts are thought to be lost, and 1 &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; short (&quot;Alice&#x27;s Auto Race&quot;) has been partially found.

<doc id="74535" wikidata="Q1753096" url="?curid=74535" title="Plane Crazy">
<text>Plane Crazy is a 1929 American animated short film directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. The cartoon, released by the Walt Disney Studios, is the first finished project to feature appearances of Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, and was originally a silent film. It was given a test screening to a theater audience and potential distributors on May 15, 1928. An executive from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer saw the film, but the film failed to pick up a distributor. Later that year, Disney released Mickey&#x27;s first sound cartoon, &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, which was an enormous success; &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; was officially released as a sound cartoon on March 17, 1929. It was the fourth Mickey film to be given a wide release after &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; and &quot;The Barn Dance&quot; (1929).

== Plot ==

Mickey is trying to fly an airplane to imitate Charles Lindbergh. After building his own airplane, he does a flight simulation to ensure that the plane is safe for flight, but the flight fails, destroying the plane. Using a roadster, a turkey&#x27;s tail and the remains of his plane to create a new plane, he asks his girlfriend Minnie to join him for its first flight after she presents him with a horseshoe for good luck. They take an out-of-control flight with exaggerated, impossible situations. Clarabelle Cow briefly &quot;rides&quot; the aircraft.

Once he regains control of the plane, he repeatedly tries to kiss Minnie. When she refuses, he uses force: he breaks her concentration and terrifies her by throwing her out of the airplane, catching her with the airplane, and he uses this to kiss her. Minnie responds by slapping Mickey and parachutes out of the plane using her bloomers. While distracted by her, Mickey loses control of the plane and eventually crashes into a tree. Minnie then lands, and Mickey laughs at her exposed bloomers. Minnie then storms off, rebuffing him. Mickey then angrily throws the good luck horseshoe given to him by Minnie, and it boomerangs around a tree, hitting him and knocking him out.

== Production ==

The short was co-directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Iwerks was also the sole animator for this short and spent just two weeks working on it in a back room, at a rate of over 700 drawings a day. It is also speculated Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising might have done work for the short as well. The sound version contained a soundtrack by Carl W. Stalling, who recorded it on October 26, 1928, when he was hired, and a month before &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; was released.

The point of view shot from the plane made it appear as if the camera was tracking into the ground. When they shot this scene, they piled books under the spinning background to move the artwork closer to the view.

== Reception ==

&quot;The Film Daily&quot; (March 24, 1929): &quot;Clever. Mickey Mouse does his animal antics in the latest mode via areoplane. [sic] The cartoonist has employed his usual ingenuity to extract a volume of laughs that are by no means confined to the juveniles. The sound effects are particularly appropriate on this type of film, and certainly add greatly to the comedy angle with the absurd squeaks, yawps and goofy noises.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; (April 3, 1929): &quot;Walt Disney sound cartoon, produced by Powers Cinephone, one of the Mickey Mouse series of animated cartoons. It&#x27;s a snappy six minutes, with plenty of nonsensical action and a fitting musical accompaniment. Constitutes an amusingly silly interlude for any wired house. Disney has derived some breezy situations, one or two of them a bit saucy but, considering the animal characters, permissible.&quot;

== Home media ==
The short was released on December 2, 2002, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Black and White&quot; and on December 11, 2007, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot;.

== Copyright and preservation status ==
The silent version was copyrighted on May 26, 1928, eleven days after it was test screened. The copyright for the silent version was renewed on March 14, 1956. The sound version was copyrighted on August 9, 1930, and was renewed on December 16, 1957, but the copyright on the title card of the film says 1929 (MCMXXIX). It is unknown to what extent changes were made between the original silent version and the sound version.

The silent version of the film entered the public domain in the United States in 2024. The sound version entered public domain on January 1, 2025 according to current U.S. copyright law.

== Legacy ==
* In 1930, the story of &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; was adapted and used for the first story in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip. This adaptation, entitled &quot;Lost on a Desert Island&quot;, was written by Walt Disney with art by Ub Iwerks and Win Smith.
* In the Mickey Mouse short &quot;The Nifty Nineties&quot; (1941), Mickey and Minnie&#x27;s car runs out of control and runs into a cow. The scene was taken almost directly from &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;.
* The cartoon &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Airplane Kit&quot; (1999) from the series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot; featured a similar premise in which Mickey built his own airplane to impress Minnie.
* In the feature film &quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot;, &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; was featured.
* &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; plays in a continuous loop in the Main Street Cinema at Disneyland, albeit silently, next to &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;.
* The airplane, horseshoe, and &quot;How to Fly&quot; book are on display as props from this short in the queue of the Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway attraction at Disneyland.
