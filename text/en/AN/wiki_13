<text>Texas hold &#x27;em (also known as Texas holdem, hold &#x27;em, and holdem) is the most popular variant of the card game of poker. Two cards, known as hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards (&quot;the flop&quot;), later an additional single card (&quot;the turn&quot; or &quot;fourth street&quot;), and a final card (&quot;the river&quot; or &quot;fifth street&quot;). Each player seeks the best five-card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards: the five community cards and their two hole cards. Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal. The player who has the best hand and has not folded by the end of all betting rounds wins all of the money bet for the hand, known as the pot. In certain situations, a &quot;split pot&quot; or &quot;tie&quot; can occur when two players have hands of equivalent value. This is also called &quot;chop the pot&quot;. &quot;Texas hold &#x27;em&quot; is also the &quot;H&quot; game featured in HORSE and HOSE.

== Objective ==
In Texas hold &#x27;em, as in all variants of poker, individuals compete for an amount of money or chips contributed by the players themselves (called the pot). Because the cards are dealt randomly and outside the control of the players, each player attempts to control the amount of money in the pot based on the hand they are holding,
and on their prediction as to what their opponents may be holding and how they might behave.

The game is divided into a series of hands (deals); at the conclusion of each hand, the pot is typically awarded to one player (an exception in which the pot is divided between two or more is discussed below). A hand may end at the showdown, in which case the remaining players compare their hands and the highest hand is awarded the pot; that highest hand is usually held by only one player, but can be held by more in the case of a tie. The other possibility for the conclusion of a hand occurs when all but one player have folded and have thereby abandoned any claim to the pot, in which case the pot is awarded to the player who has not folded.

The objective of winning players is not to win every individual hand, but rather to win over the longer term by making mathematically and psychologically better decisions regarding when and how much to bet, raise, call or fold. Winning poker players work to enhance their opponents&#x27; betting and maximize their own expected gain on each round of betting, to thereby increase their long-term winnings.

== History ==

Although little is known about the invention of Texas hold &#x27;em, the Texas Legislature officially recognizes Robstown, Texas, as the game&#x27;s birthplace, dating it to the early 20th century.

After the game spread throughout Texas, hold &#x27;em was introduced to Las Vegas in 1963 at the California Club by Corky McCorquodale. The game became popular and quickly spread to the Golden Nugget, Stardust and Dunes. In 1967, a group of Texan gamblers and card players, including Crandell Addington, Doyle Brunson, and Amarillo Slim were playing in Las Vegas. This is when &quot;ace high&quot; was changed from the original form in which aces were low. Addington said the first time he saw the game was in 1959. &quot;They didn&#x27;t call it Texas hold &#x27;em at the time, they just called it hold &#x27;em.… I thought then that if it were to catch on, it would become the game. Draw poker, you bet only twice; hold &#x27;em, you bet four times. That meant you could play strategically. This was more of a thinking man&#x27;s game.&quot;

For several years the Golden Nugget Casino in Downtown Las Vegas was the only casino in Las Vegas to offer the game. At that time, the Golden Nugget&#x27;s poker room was &quot;truly a &#x27;sawdust joint,&#x27; with…oiled sawdust covering the floors.&quot; Because of its location and decor, this poker room did not receive many rich drop-in clients, and as a result, professional players sought a more prominent location. In 1969, the Las Vegas professionals were invited to play Texas hold &#x27;em at the entrance of the now-demolished Dunes Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. This prominent location, and the relative inexperience of poker players with Texas hold &#x27;em, resulted in a very remunerative game for professional players.

After a failed attempt to establish a &quot;Gambling Fraternity Convention&quot;, Tom Moore added the first ever poker tournament to the Second Annual Gambling Fraternity Convention held in 1969. This tournament featured several games, including Texas hold &#x27;em. In 1970, Benny and Jack Binion acquired the rights to this convention, renamed it the World Series of Poker, and moved it to their casino, Binion&#x27;s Horseshoe, in Las Vegas. After its first year, a journalist, Tom Thackrey, suggested that the main event of this tournament should be no-limit Texas hold &#x27;em. The Binions agreed and ever since no-limit Texas hold &#x27;em has been played as the main event. Interest in the main event continued to grow steadily over the next two decades. After receiving only eight entrants in 1972, the numbers grew to over one hundred entrants in 1982, and over two hundred in 1991.

During this time, B &amp; G Publishing Co., Inc. published Doyle Brunson&#x27;s revolutionary poker strategy guide, &quot;Super/System&quot;. Despite being self-published and priced at $100 in 1978, the book revolutionized the way poker was played. It was one of the first books to discuss Texas hold &#x27;em, and is today cited as one of the most important books on this game. In 1983, Al Alvarez published &quot;The Biggest Game in Town&quot;, a book detailing a 1981 World Series of Poker event. The first book of its kind, it described the world of professional poker players and the World Series of Poker. Alvarez&#x27;s book is credited with beginning the genre of poker literature and with bringing Texas hold &#x27;em (and poker generally) to a wider audience.
Alvarez&#x27;s book was not the first book about poker. &quot;The Education of a Poker Player&quot;, by Herbert Yardley, a former U.S. government code breaker, was published in 1957.

Interest in hold &#x27;em outside of Nevada began to grow in the 1980s as well. Although California had legal card rooms offering draw poker, Texas hold &#x27;em was deemed to be prohibited under a statute that made illegal the (now unheard of) game &quot;stud-horse&quot;. But in 1988 Texas hold &#x27;em was declared legally distinct from stud-horse in &quot;Tibbetts v. Van De Kamp&quot;, and declared to be a game of skill. Almost immediately card rooms across the state offered Texas hold &#x27;em. It is often presumed that this decision ruled that hold &#x27;em was a game of skill, but the distinction between skill and chance has never entered into California jurisprudence regarding poker.

After a trip to Las Vegas, bookmakers Terry Rogers and Liam Flood introduced the game to European card players in the early 1980s.

== Popularity ==
Texas hold &#x27;em is currently the most popular form of poker. Texas hold &#x27;em&#x27;s popularity surged in the 2000s due to exposure on television, the Internet and popular literature. During this time hold &#x27;em replaced seven-card stud as the most common game in U.S. casinos. The no-limit betting form is used in the widely televised main event of the World Series of Poker (WSOP) and the World Poker Tour (WPT). 

Hold &#x27;em&#x27;s simplicity and popularity have inspired a wide variety of strategy books that provide recommendations for proper play. Most of these books recommend a strategy that involves playing relatively few hands but betting and raising often with the hands one plays.
In the first decade of the twenty-first century, Texas hold &#x27;em experienced a surge in popularity worldwide. Many observers attribute this growth to the synergy of five factors: the invention of online poker, the game&#x27;s appearance in film and on television, invention and usage of the &quot;hole card cam&quot; (which allowed viewers to see hole cards played in the hand as a means of determining strategy and decision-making during gameplay), the appearance of television commercials advertising online cardrooms, and the 2003 World Series of Poker championship victory by online qualifier Chris Moneymaker. 

=== Television and film ===

Prior to poker becoming widely televised, the movie &quot;Rounders&quot; (1998), starring Matt Damon and Edward Norton, gave moviegoers a romantic view of the game as a way of life despite the poker portrayed being often criticized by more serious players. Texas hold &#x27;em was the main game played during the movie and the no-limit variety was described, following Doyle Brunson, as the &quot;Cadillac of Poker&quot;. A clip of the classic showdown between Johnny Chan and Erik Seidel from the 1988 World Series of Poker was also incorporated into the film. More recently, a high-stakes Texas hold &#x27;em game was central to the plot of the 2006 James Bond film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, in place of baccarat, the casino game central to the novel of the same name on which the film was based. In 2008, an acclaimed short film called &quot;Shark Out of Water&quot; was released on DVD. This film is unique in that it deals with the darker, more addictive elements of the game, and features Phil Hellmuth and Brad Booth.

Hold &#x27;em tournaments had been televised since the late 1970s, but they did not become popular until 1999, when hidden lipstick cameras were first used to show players&#x27; private hole cards on the &quot;Late Night Poker&quot; TV show in the United Kingdom. Hold &#x27;em exploded in popularity as a spectator sport in the United States and Canada in early 2003, when the World Poker Tour adopted the lipstick cameras idea. A few months later, ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the 2003 World Series of Poker featured the unexpected victory of Internet player Chris Moneymaker, an amateur player who gained admission to the tournament by winning a series of online tournaments. Moneymaker&#x27;s victory initiated a sudden surge of interest in the series (along with internet poker), based on the egalitarian idea that anyone—even a rank novice—could become a world champion.

In 2003, there were 839 entrants in the WSOP main event, and triple that number in 2004. The crowning of the 2004 WSOP champion, Greg &quot;Fossilman&quot; Raymer, a patent attorney from Connecticut, further fueled the popularity of the event among amateur (and particularly Internet) players. In the 2005 main event, an unprecedented 5,619 entrants vied for a first prize of $7,500,000. The winner, Joe Hachem of Australia, was a semi-professional player. This growth continued in 2006, with 8,773 entrants and a first place prize of $12,000,000 (won by Jamie Gold).

Beyond the series, other television shows—including the long running &quot;World Poker Tour&quot;—are credited with increasing the popularity of Texas hold &#x27;em. In addition to its presence on network and general audience cable television, poker has now become a regular part of sports networks&#x27; programming in the United States.

=== Literature ===
The English journalist and biographer Anthony Holden spent a year on the professional poker circuit from 1988 to 1989 and wrote about his experiences in &quot;Big Deal: A Year as a Professional Poker Player&quot;. The follow-up book, &quot;Bigger Deal: A Year Inside the Poker Boom&quot; covers the period 2005–2006 and describes a poker world &quot;changed beyond recognition&quot;.

Twenty years after the publication of Alvarez&#x27;s groundbreaking book, James McManus
published a semi-autobiographical book, &quot;Positively Fifth Street&quot; (2003), which simultaneously describes the trial surrounding the murder of Ted Binion and McManus&#x27;s own entry into the 2000 World Series of Poker. McManus, a poker amateur, finished fifth in the no-limit Texas hold &#x27;em main event, winning over $200,000. In the book McManus discusses events surrounding the series, the trial of Sandy Murphy and Rick Tabish, poker strategy, and some history of poker and the world series.

Michael Craig&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;The Professor, the Banker, and the Suicide King&quot; details a series of high-stakes Texas hold &#x27;em one-on-one games between Texas banker Andy Beal and a rotating group of poker professionals. As of 2006, these games were the highest stakes ever played, reaching $100,000–$200,000 fixed limit.

=== Online poker ===
The ability to play cheaply and anonymously online has been credited as a cause of the increase in popularity of Texas hold &#x27;em. Online poker sites both allow people to try out games (in some cases the games are entirely free to play and are just for fun social experiences) and also provide an avenue for entry into large tournaments (like the World Series of Poker) via smaller tournaments known as satellites. The 2003 and 2004 winners (Chris Moneymaker and Greg Raymer, respectively) of the World Series no-limit hold &#x27;em main event qualified by playing in these tournaments.

Although online poker grew from its inception in 1998 until 2003, Moneymaker&#x27;s win and the appearance of television advertisements in 2003 contributed to a tripling of industry revenues in 2004.

== Rules ==
=== Betting structures ===

Hold &#x27;em is normally played using small and big blind bets—forced bets by two players. Antes (forced contributions by all players) may be used in addition to blinds, particularly in later stages of tournament play. A dealer button is used to represent the player in the dealer position; the dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand, changing the position of the dealer and blinds. The &quot;small blind&quot; is posted by the player to the left of the dealer and is usually equal to half of the big blind. The &quot;big blind&quot;, posted by the player to the left of the small blind, is equal to the minimum bet. In tournament poker, the blind/ante structure periodically increases as the tournament progresses. After one round of betting is done, the next betting round will start by the person in the small blind.

When only two players remain, special &quot;head-to-head&quot; or &quot;heads up&quot; rules are enforced and the blinds are posted differently. In this case, the person with the dealer button posts the small blind, while their opponent places the big blind. The dealer acts first before the flop. After the flop, the dealer acts last and continues to do so for the remainder of the hand.

The three most common variations of hold &#x27;em are &quot;limit&quot; hold &#x27;em, &quot;no-limit&quot; hold &#x27;em and &quot;pot-limit&quot; hold &#x27;em. Limit hold &#x27;em has historically been the most popular form of hold &#x27;em found in casino live action games in the United States. In limit hold &#x27;em, bets and raises during the first two rounds of betting (pre-flop and flop) must be equal to the big blind; this amount is called the &quot;small bet&quot;. In the next two rounds of betting (turn and river), bets and raises must be equal to twice the big blind; this amount is called the &quot;big bet&quot;.

No-limit hold &#x27;em has grown in popularity and is the form most commonly found in televised tournament poker and is the game played in the main event of the World Series of Poker. In no-limit hold &#x27;em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum raise up to all of the chips the player has at the table (called an all-in bet). The minimum raise is equal to the size of the previous bet or raise. If someone wishes to re-raise, they must raise at least the amount of the previous raise. For example, if the big blind is $2 and there is a raise of $6 to a total of $8, a re-raise must be at least $6 more for a total of $14. If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise (or half the size in some casinos), the initial raiser cannot re-raise again (in case there are other players also still in the game). In pot-limit hold &#x27;em, the maximum raise is the current size of the pot (including the amount needed to call).

Some casinos that offer hold &#x27;em also allow the player to the left of the big blind to post an optional live straddle, usually double the amount of the big blind. This causes that player to act as the big blind and the player has an option to raise when it comes to their turn again. (Some variations allow for straddle on the button). No-limit games may also allow multiple re-straddles, in any amount that would be a legal raise.

=== Play of the hand ===


Following a shuffle of the cards, play begins with each player being dealt two cards face down, with the player in the small blind receiving the first card and the player in the button seat receiving the last card dealt. (As in most poker games, the deck is a standard 52-card deck containing no jokers.) These cards are the players&#x27; &quot;hole&quot; or &quot;pocket&quot; cards. These are the only cards each player will receive individually, and they will (possibly) be revealed only at the showdown, making Texas hold &#x27;em a closed poker game.

The hand begins with a &quot;pre-flop&quot; betting round, beginning with the player to the left of the big blind (or the player to the left of the dealer, if no blinds are used) and continuing clockwise. A round of betting continues until every player has folded, put in all of their chips, or matched the amount put in by all other active players. See betting for a detailed account. Note that the blinds are considered &quot;live&quot; in the pre-flop betting round, meaning that they are counted toward the amount that the blind player must contribute. If all players call around to the player in the big blind position, that player may either check or raise.

After the pre-flop betting round, assuming there remain at least two players taking part in the hand, the dealer deals a flop: three face-up community cards. The flop is followed by a second betting round. This and all subsequent betting rounds begin with the player to the dealer&#x27;s left and continue clockwise.

After the flop betting round ends, a single community card (called the turn or fourth street) is dealt, followed by a third betting round. A final single community card (called the river or fifth street) is then dealt, followed by a fourth betting round and the showdown, if necessary.

In all casinos, the dealer will burn a card before the flop, turn, and river. Because of this burn, players who are betting cannot see the back of the next community card to come. This is done for traditional reasons, to avoid any possibility of a player knowing in advance the next card to be dealt due to its being marked.

=== The showdown ===
If a player bets and all other players fold, then the remaining player is awarded the pot and is not required to show their hole cards. If two or more players remain after the final betting round, a showdown occurs. On the showdown, each player plays the best poker hand they can make from the seven cards comprising their two hole cards and the five community cards. A player may use both of their own two hole cards, only one, or none at all, to form their final five-card hand. If the five community cards form the player&#x27;s best hand, then the player is said to be &quot;playing the board&quot; and can only hope to split the pot, because each other player can also use the same five cards to construct the same hand.

If the best hand is shared by more than one player, then the pot is split equally among them, with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in clockwise order. It is common for players to have closely valued, but not identically ranked hands. Nevertheless, one must be careful in determining the best hand; if the hand involves fewer than five cards (such as two pair or three of a kind), then kickers are used to settle ties (see the second example below). The card&#x27;s &quot;numerical&quot; rank is of sole importance; suit values are irrelevant in hold &#x27;em.

=== Hand values ===
The following table shows the possible hand values in increasing order.
=== Misdeal ===
If the first or second card dealt is exposed, then this is considered a misdeal. The dealer then retrieves the card, reshuffles the deck, and again cuts the cards. However, if any other hole card is exposed due to a dealer error, the deal continues as usual. After completing the deal, the dealer replaces the exposed card with the top card on the deck, and the exposed card is then used as the burn card. If more than one hole card is exposed, a misdeal is declared by the dealer and the hand is dealt again from the beginning.
A misdeal is also declared if a player receives more than two hole cards by mistake (e.g. two cards stuck together).

== Examples ==

=== Sample showdown ===
Here is a sample showdown:

Each player plays the best five-card hand they can make with the seven cards available. Below is the list of best hands each player has.

In this case, Ted wins as he has the best hand (full house). If arranged in order of hand strength from the strongest, it would be Ted&#x27;s full house, Carol&#x27;s flush, Alice&#x27;s straight, and Bob&#x27;s three of a kind.

=== Sample hand ===
Here is a sample game involving four players. The players&#x27; individual hands will not be revealed until the showdown, to give a better sense of what happens during play:

Compulsory bets: Alice is the dealer. Bob, to Alice&#x27;s left, posts a small blind of $1, and Carol posts a big blind of $2.

Pre-flop: Alice deals two hole cards face down to each player, beginning with Bob and ending with herself. Ted must act first, being the first player after the big blind. Ted cannot check, because the $2 big blind plays as a bet, and so folds. Alice calls the $2. Bob adds an additional $1 to the $1 small blind to call the $2 total. Carol&#x27;s blind is &quot;live&quot; (see blind), so there is the &quot;option&quot; to raise here, but Carol checks instead, ending the first betting round. The pot now contains $6, $2 from each of three players.

Flop: Alice now burns a card and deals the flop of three face-up community cards, . On this round, as on all subsequent rounds, the player on the dealer&#x27;s left begins the betting. Bob checks, Carol opens for $2, and Alice raises another $2 (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol and $2 to raise), making the total bet now facing Bob $4. Bob calls (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol&#x27;s initial bet and $2 to match Alice&#x27;s raise). Carol calls as well, putting in $2. The pot now contains $18, $6 from the last round and $12 from three players this round.

Turn: Alice now burns another card and deals the turn card face up. It is the . Bob checks, Carol checks, and Alice checks; the turn has been &quot;checked around&quot;. The pot still contains $18.

River: Alice burns another card and deals the final river card, the , making the final board . Bob bets $4, Carol calls, and Alice folds (Alice&#x27;s holding was and was hoping the river card would be a club to make a flush).

Showdown: Bob shows his hand of , so the best five-card hand possible is , for three nines, with a king-queen kicker. Carol shows her cards of , making a final hand for two pair, kings and nines, with a jack kicker. Bob wins the showdown and the $26 pot.

=== Kickers and ties ===
Because of the presence of community cards in Texas hold &#x27;em, different players&#x27; hands can often run very close in value. As a result, it is common for kickers to be used to determine the winning hand and also for two hands (or maybe more) to tie. A kicker is a card that is part of the five-card poker hand, but is not used in determining a hand&#x27;s rank. For instance, in the hand A-A-A-K-Q, the king and queen are kickers.

The following situation illustrates the importance of breaking ties with kickers and card ranks, as well as the use of the five-card rule. After the turn, the board and players&#x27; hole cards are as follows.
At the moment, Bob is in the lead with a hand of , making two pair, queens and eights, with a king kicker. This beats Carol&#x27;s hand of by virtue of the king kicker.

Suppose the final card is the , making the final board . Bob and Carol still each have two pair (queens and eights), but both of them are now entitled to play the final ace as their fifth card, making their hands both two pair, queens and eights, with an ace kicker. Bob&#x27;s king no longer plays, because the ace on the board plays as the fifth card in both hands, and a hand is only composed of the best five cards. They therefore tie and split the pot. However, if the last card is a jack or lower (except an eight, which would make a full house, or a ten, which would give Carol a higher second pair), Bob&#x27;s king stays in the game and Bob wins.

== Strategy ==
Most poker authors recommend a tight-aggressive approach to playing Texas hold &#x27;em. This strategy involves playing relatively few hands (tight), but betting and raising often with those that one does play (aggressive). Although this strategy is often recommended, some professional players successfully employ other strategies as well.

Almost all authors agree that where a player sits in the order of play (known as position) is an important element of Texas hold &#x27;em strategy, particularly in no-limit hold&#x27;em. Players who act later have more information than players who act earlier. As a result, players typically play fewer hands from early positions than later positions.

Because of the game&#x27;s level of complexity, it has received some attention from academics. One attempt to develop a quantitative model of a Texas hold&#x27;em tournament as an isolated complex system has had some success, although the full consequences for optimal strategies remain to be explored. In addition, groups at the University of Alberta and Carnegie Mellon University worked to develop poker playing programs utilizing techniques in game theory and artificial intelligence. In January 2015, the AAAS journal Science reported that the group at the University of Alberta had succeeded in coding a computer program called Cepheus that can learn from its playing experience to optimize its CFR algorithm and approach playing perfection when opposing strong players in the variant known as heads-up limit Texas Hold &#x27;em, which involves only two players. Although it does not win every hand, it is unbeatable on average over a large number of hands. The program exhibits more variation in its tactics than professional players do, for instance bluffing with weak hands that professional players tend to fold. Public web access to observe and play against Cepheus is available.

=== Starting hands ===
Because only two cards are dealt to each player, it is easy to characterize all of the starting hands. There are (52 × 51)/2 = 1,326 distinct possible combinations of two cards from a standard 52-card deck. Because no suit is more powerful than another, many of these can be equated for the analysis of starting-hand strategy. For example, although and are distinct combinations of cards by rank and suit, they are of equal value as starting hands.

Because of this equivalence, there are only 169 effectively different hole-card combinations. Thirteen of these are pairs, from deuces (twos) to aces. There are 78 ways to have two cards of different rank (12 possible hands containing one ace, 11 possible hands containing one king but no ace, 10 possible hands containing one queen but no ace or king, etc.). Both hole cards can be used in a flush if they are suited, but pairs are never suited, so there would be 13 possible pairs, 78 possible suited non-pairs, and 78 possible unsuited (&quot;off-suit&quot;) non-pairs, for a total of 169 possible hands. Suited starting hands are stronger than their unsuited counterparts, although the magnitude of this strength advantage in different games is debated.

Because of the limited number of starting hands, most strategy guides include a detailed discussion of each of them. This distinguishes hold &#x27;em from other poker games where the number of starting card combinations forces strategy guides to group hands into broad categories. Another result of this small number is the proliferation of colloquial names for individual hands.

=== Strategic differences in betting structures ===
Texas Hold&#x27;em is commonly played both as a &quot;cash&quot; or &quot;ring&quot; game and as a tournament game. Strategy for these different forms can vary.

==== Cash games ====
Before the advent of poker tournaments, all poker games were played with real money where players bet actual currency (or chips that represented currency). Games that feature wagering actual money on individual hands are still very common and are referred to as &quot;cash games&quot; or &quot;ring games&quot;.

The no-limit and fixed-limit cash-game versions of hold &#x27;em are strategically very different. Doyle Brunson claims that &quot;the games are so different that there are not many players who rank with the best in both types of hold &#x27;em. Many no-limit players have difficulty &quot;gearing down&quot; for limit, while limit players often lack the courage and &#x27;feel&#x27; necessary to excel at no-limit.&quot; Because the size of bets is restricted in limit games, the ability to bluff is somewhat curtailed. Because one is not (usually) risking all of one&#x27;s chips in limit poker, players are sometimes advised to take more chances.

Lower-stakes games also exhibit different properties than higher-stakes games. Small-stakes games often involve more players in each hand and can vary from extremely passive (little raising and betting) to extremely aggressive (many raises). This difference of small-stakes games has prompted several books dedicated to only those games.

==== Tournaments ====

Texas hold &#x27;em is often associated with poker tournaments largely because it is played as the main event in many of the famous tournaments, including the World Series of Poker&#x27;s Main Event, and is the most common tournament overall. Traditionally, a poker tournament is played with chips that represent a player&#x27;s stake in the tournament. Standard play allows all entrants to &quot;buy-in&quot; for a fixed amount and all players begin with an equal value of chips. Play proceeds until one player has accumulated all the chips in play or a deal is made among the remaining players to &quot;chop&quot; the remaining prize pool. The money pool is redistributed to the players in relation to the place they finished in the tournament. Only a small percentage of the players receive any money, with the majority receiving nothing. &quot;The percentages are not standardized, but common rules of thumb call for one table&quot; (usually nine players) &quot;to get paid for each 100 entrants,&quot; according to poker author Andrew Glazer, in his book, &quot;The Complete Idiot&#x27;s Guide to Poker&quot;. A good rule of thumb is that close to 10% of players will be paid in a tournament. As a result, the strategy in poker tournaments can be very different from a cash game.

Proper strategy in tournaments can vary widely depending on the amount of chips one has, the stage of the tournament, the amount of chips others have, and the playing styles of one&#x27;s opponents. Although some authors still recommend a tight playing style, others recommend looser play (playing more hands) in tournaments than one would otherwise play in cash games. In tournaments the blinds and antes increase regularly, and can become much larger near the end of the tournament. This can force players to play hands that they would not normally play when the blinds were small, which can warrant both more loose and more aggressive play.

==== Evaluating a hand ====
One of the most important things in Texas hold&#x27;em is knowing how to evaluate a hand.
The strategy of playing each hand can be very different according to the strength of the hand. For example, on a strong hand, a player might want to try to appear weak in order to not scare off other players with weaker hands, while on a weak hand, a player might try to bluff other players into folding.

There are several ways to evaluate hand strength; two of the most common are counting outs and using calculators.

=====Counting outs=====
This method consists of counting the cards still in the deck, which in combination with the cards the player already has can give the player a potentially winning hand.
Such cards are called &quot;outs&quot;, and hand strength can be measured by how many outs are still in the deck (if there are many outs then the probability to get one of them is high and therefore the hand is strong). The following chart determines the probability of hitting outs (bettering the player&#x27;s hand) based on how many cards are left in the deck and the draw type.
Multiplying the number of outs by two or four (the Two Times Rule or Four Times Rule) gives a reasonable approximation to the One Card % or Two Card %, respectively, in the above table. For example, an open straight draw on the flop has 8 outs so the odds to hit the straight on the turn is 16% (8 x 2) and the odds on the river is 32% (8 x 4).

=====Calculators=====
Calculators are poker tools that calculate the odds of a hand (combined with the cards on the table if there are any) to win the game. Calculators provide precise odds but they cannot be used in live games and are therefore mostly used on Internet poker games. The first known commercial poker calculator was marketed by Mike Caro. Michael Shackleford, the Wizard of Odds, later made one available to the public free of charge on his website.

There are several other poker variants that resemble Texas hold &#x27;em. Hold &#x27;em is a member of a class of poker games known as community card games, where some cards are available for use by all the players. There are several other games that use five community cards in addition to some private cards and are thus like Texas hold &#x27;em. Royal hold &#x27;em has the same structure as Texas hold &#x27;em, but the deck contains only Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, and Tens. Pineapple and Omaha hold &#x27;em both vary the number of cards an individual receives before the flop (along with the rules regarding how they may be used to form a hand), but are dealt identically afterward. In Double Texas Hold&#x27;em, each player receives 3 hole cards and establishes a middle common card that plays with each of the other cards, but the outer cards don&#x27;t play with each other (each player has two 2-card hands). Alternatively, in Double-board hold&#x27;em all players receive the same number of private cards, but there are two sets of community cards. The winner is either selected for each individual board with each receiving half of the pot, or the best overall hand takes the entire pot, depending on the rules agreed upon by the players.

Another variant is known as Greek hold &#x27;em which requires each player to use both hole cards and only 3 from the board instead of the best five of seven cards.

Manila is a hold&#x27;em variant that was once popular in Australia. In Manila, players receive two private cards from a reduced deck (containing no cards lower than 7). A five-card board is dealt, unlike Texas hold &#x27;em, one card at a time; there is a betting round after each card. Manila has several variations of its own, similar to the variants listed above.

Six-plus hold &#x27;em (also known as Short-deck hold &#x27;em) is a community card poker game variant of Texas hold &#x27;em, where cards 2 through 5 are removed. Each player is dealt two cards face down and seeks to make his or her best five-card poker hand using from any combination of the seven cards (five community cards and their own two hole cards).

<text>Sick Puppy is a 2000 novel by Carl Hiaasen.

==Plot summary==
Robert Clapley, a former drug smuggler-turned-real estate developer, plans to build high-rise condominiums on Toad Island, the home to a large population of oak toads. The project requires the construction of a massive new bridge to the mainland to accommodate Clapley&#x27;s cement trucks. On the recommendation of Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Artemus, a corrupt governor of Florida to whom Clapley has given large campaign contributions, Clapley hires lobbyist Palmer Stoat to expedite the government funding for the bridge construction. By random happenstance, Stoat becomes subject to the obsessive wrath of ecoterrorist Twilly Spree after he witnesses him litter the highway from his luxury Range Rover. Twilly tracks Stoat back to the Fort Lauderdale residence he shares with his wife, Desirata.

Twilly arranges ironic prankshijacking a garbage truck and dumping its load into Desi&#x27;s convertible, and filling Stoat&#x27;s Range Rover with dung beetlesbut is aggravated when Stoat continues to litter. When he breaks into Stoat&#x27;s home, he is confronted by his massive Labrador Retriever and by Desi herself. Desi, who is increasingly unhappy with her marriage, tells Twilly that he is &quot;aiming low&quot; if he is trying to correct Stoat&#x27;s misbehavior. She guides him to Toad Island, where Clapley&#x27;s construction crew has deliberately buried thousands of oak toads to avoid later protest by environmentalists. Twilly orders Desi to tell Stoat that he will kill the dog if he doesn&#x27;t stop the bridge project. Stoat dismisses the threat until Twilly sends him a roadkill Labrador&#x27;s severed ear via FedEx. The actual dog becomes Twilly&#x27;s companion after he changes his name to &quot;McGuinn.&quot;

Stoat convinces Artemus to veto funding for the bridge but has no intention of letting the project fail. He tells Clapley and Artemus that the funding can be put back into the budget later, through a special session of the Florida legislature. Clapley sends a hit man, Mr. Gash, to kill Twilly, while Artemus, in an effort to avoid the project being tainted by a violent death, locates ex-governor Clinton Tyree, a.k.a. &quot;Skink&quot;, who vanished in the mid-1970s after a short term of office and is said to be hiding in the remaining wilderness of Florida. Artemus knows that Skink&#x27;s mentally disturbed elder brother, Doyle, is still on the state&#x27;s payroll as the keeper of an abandoned lighthouse and threatens to put him on the street if Skink doesn&#x27;t apprehend Twilly. Artemus fails to realize the dire consequences of threatening Skink, or of putting him and Twilly in contact with each other.

Desi becomes attracted to Twilly, and the two eventually develop a relationship. Stoat is disgusted and washes his hands of her and McGuinn, telling Twilly that the bridge is going up no matter what he does. A violent confrontation with Twilly, Desi and Skink on Toad Island leaves Mr. Gash mortally wounded. Twilly is left in Skink&#x27;s care while Desi returns to her parents&#x27; home in Atlanta. Despite her pleadings, Twilly is still committed to stopping the Toad Island project. Accompanied by Skink, Twilly trails Stoat, Clapley and Artemus to a private canned hunting reserve in northern Florida, where Stoat has arranged for Clapley to shoot a black rhinoceros and win over Willie Vasquez-Washington, a crucial member of the Florida House who is opposed to the special session.

Twilly is on the verge of shooting Clapley, but McGuinn runs into the preserve and nips playfully at the rhino&#x27;s tail. The rhinoso ancient that it has hardly moved since it arrived at the ranchgoes berserk and charges at the hunting party. Clapley is gored to death on the rhino&#x27;s horn, and Stoat is trampled flat. Artemus escapes the chaos but is mortified to learn that Willie snapped photos of the fiasco. Clapley&#x27;s death dooms the Toad Island project. Apart from his many lobbying clients and crony politicians, only a few friends and family members show up at Stoat&#x27;s funeral. Desi is among the mourners, during which she is approached by McGuinn, holding a note with Twilly&#x27;s new address on it. Meanwhile, Twilly and Skink are driving along the highway when they see another group of litterbugs. They immediately agree they have to teach them a lesson.

==Characters in &quot;Sick Puppy&quot;==
*Twilly Spree: college dropout, millionaire, protagonist
*Palmer Stoat: lobbyist and political fixer
*Desirata Stoat: Palmer&#x27;s trophy wife

==Major themes==
Although some of the themes of the novel may suggest an autobiographical element the author himself shrugs off at least one aspect of this parallel. The main character Twilly and himself both had attorney forebears who lived in Southern Florida, but the development in this area came as a surprise to him and his attorney father and grandfather.

==Allusions to actual history, science, and current events==
*One of Stoat&#x27;s most annoying (to his wife) habits is using snippets from classic rock songs in everyday conversation, especially because he always gets the lyrics wrong:
**&quot;I read the newspaper today, oh boy.&quot; (A Day in the Life by The Beatles)
**&quot;Come on, baby, light my candle.&quot; (Light My Fire by The Doors)
**&quot;I&#x27;m having a tough day&#x27;s night.&quot; (A Hard Day&#x27;s Night by The Beatles)
**&quot;You&#x27;re thick as a stick.&quot; (Thick as a Brick by Jethro Tull)
**&quot;Blond sugar, like the song says.&quot; (Brown Sugar by The Rolling Stones)
**&quot;He&#x27;s a no-place man.&quot; (Nowhere Man by The Beatles)
**&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Great&quot; (Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice by The Beach Boys)
**&quot;Happiness is a hot gun.&quot; (Happiness Is a Warm Gun by The Beatles)
**&quot;You can&#x27;t always do who you want.&quot; (You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want by The Rolling Stones)
*Krimmler, Clapley&#x27;s project manager, justifies his decision to bury the oak toad habitat on the island by referring to the Snail darter controversy.
*Twilly renames Stoat&#x27;s dog after guitarist Roger McGuinn, one of the founding members of The Byrds. Several years after the book&#x27;s publication, McGuinn himself met Hiaasen at a book signing and thanked him for the tribute.
*Palmer blames Desi&#x27;s aversion to cigar smoking on then-President Bill Clinton, &quot;and his twisted bimbos,&quot; a reference to Monica Lewinsky&#x27;s allegation that Clinton penetrated her with a cigar tube.
*Skink humiliates Governor Artemus inside the executive mansion in a way that reminds Artemus of the fate of Ned Beatty&#x27;s character in the film &quot;Deliverance&quot;.
*A subplot of the novel is based on Stoat&#x27;s, and later Clapley&#x27;s, obsession with the use of rhinoceros horns as an aphrodisiac.
*In a 2010 interview with Bloomberg News about his later novel &quot;Star Island&quot;, Hiaasen said of &quot;Sick Puppy&quot;, &quot;I thought I&#x27;d invented the most despicable lobbyist ever, and then Jack Abramoff comes along and makes my guy look like the Dalai Lama.&quot;
*The novel&#x27;s title - Sick Puppy - alludes to the narrator of the David Foster Wallace short story Girl with Curious Hair from the eponymous short story collection. The themes of the book, including the overlaps between violent nihilism and establishment politics, are also explored by Wallace in his work.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;Sick Puppy&quot; has been reviewed well and one example describes Hiaasen&#x27;s skills thus.

Other reviews praised the novel&#x27;s harder edges.

In his review of Hiaasen&#x27;s later novel &quot;Skinny Dip&quot;, Michael Grunwald made several references to the characters of &quot;Sick Puppy&quot;:

==Cultural influence==

*The title of the book inspired the name of Australian rock band Sick Puppies.

== See also ==
*T. Coraghessan Boyle&#x27;s novel &quot;A Friend of the Earth&quot; is a slightly more serious treatment of ecoterrorism and ecotage.
*Henry Adams&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot; discusses similar politics during the late 19th century.
*Lobbying in the United States

== Continuity ==
*This book is the fourth appearance of Hiaasen&#x27;s recurring character Clinton Tyree, aka Skink, who was first introduced in &quot;Double Whammy&quot;.
*Twilly Spree reappears in Hiaasen&#x27;s books &quot;Skinny Dip&quot; and &quot;Scat&quot;.
*One of Palmer&#x27;s lobbying clients, mentioned in passing, is a United States Congresswoman wishing to reward sugar company executives who have &quot;persuaded their Jamaican and Haitian cane pickers to donate generously - well beyond their means, in fact - to [her] reelection account.&quot; This scam - using the names of migrant workers to cover illegal hard money donations - was also used by the sugar cane industry to support the corrupt Congressman Dilbeck in Hiaasen&#x27;s novel &quot;Strip Tease&quot;.
*Palmer Stoat, in one of his many malapropisms, mis-quotes the Jethro Tull song &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; by using the word &quot;stick&quot; instead. Hiaasen used the same malapropism in the title of a January 5, 2018, column for the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, written as a mock apology letter from Steve Bannon to then-President Donald Trump, attempting to explain away some of the statements attributed to Bannon in Michael Wolff&#x27;s book &quot;Fire and Fury&quot;, including his description of Trump&#x27;s daughter Ivanka, appointed her father&#x27;s Advisor, as &quot;dumb as a brick.&quot;

<text>In poker, the probability of each type of 5-card hand can be computed by calculating the proportion of hands of that type among all possible hands.

== History ==
Probability and gambling have been ideas since long before the invention of poker. The development of probability theory in the late 1400s was attributed to gambling; when playing a game with high stakes, players wanted to know what the chance of winning would be. In 1494, Fra Luca Pacioli released his work which was the first written text on probability. Motivated by Pacioli&#x27;s work, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) made further developments in probability theory. His work from 1550, titled &quot;Liber de Ludo Aleae&quot;, discussed the concepts of probability and how they were directly related to gambling. However, his work did not receive any immediate recognition since it was not published until after his death. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) also contributed to probability theory. His friend, Chevalier de Méré, was an avid gambler with the goal to become wealthy from it. De Méré tried a new mathematical approach to a gambling game but did not get the desired results. Determined to know why his strategy was unsuccessful, he consulted with Pascal. Pascal&#x27;s work on this problem began an important correspondence between him and fellow mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Communicating through letters, the two continued to exchange their ideas and thoughts. These interactions led to the conception of basic probability theory. To this day, many gamblers still rely on the basic concepts of probability theory in order to make informed decisions while gambling.

==Frequencies==
===5-card poker hands===
In straight poker and five-card draw, where there are no hole cards, players are simply dealt five cards from a deck of 52.

The following chart enumerates the (absolute) frequency of each hand, given all combinations of five cards randomly drawn from a full deck of 52 without replacement. Wild cards are not considered. In this chart:

*Distinct hands is the number of different ways to draw the hand, not counting different suits. In particular, a set of hands that all tie each other is counted exactly once, not multiply.
*Frequency is the number of ways to draw the hand, &quot;including&quot; the same card values in different suits.
*The Probability of drawing a given hand is calculated by dividing the number of ways of drawing the hand (Frequency) by the total number of 5-card hands (the sample space; formula_1). For example, there are 4 different ways to draw a royal flush (one for each suit), so the probability is , or one in 649,740. One would then expect to draw this hand about once in every 649,740 draws, or nearly 0.000154% of the time.
*Cumulative probability refers to the probability of drawing a hand as good as &quot;or better than&quot; the specified one. For example, the probability of drawing three of a kind is approximately 2.11%, while the probability of drawing a hand &quot;at least&quot; as good as three of a kind is about 2.87%. The cumulative probability is determined by adding one hand&#x27;s probability with the probabilities of all hands above it. 
*The Odds are defined as the ratio of the number of ways &quot;not&quot; to draw the hand, to the number of ways to draw it. In statistics, this is called odds against. For instance, with a royal flush, there are 4 ways to draw one, and 2,598,956 ways to draw something else, so the odds against drawing a royal flush are 2,598,956 : 4, or 649,739 : 1. The formula for establishing the odds can also be stated as &quot;(1/p) - 1 : 1&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; is the aforementioned probability.
*The values given for Probability, Cumulative probability, and Odds are rounded off for simplicity; the Distinct hands and Frequency values are exact.

The &quot;nCr&quot; function on most scientific calculators can be used to calculate hand frequencies; entering with and , for example, yields formula_1 as above.

The royal flush is a case of the straight flush. It can be formed 4 ways (one for each suit), giving it a probability of 0.000154% and odds of 649,739 : 1.

When ace-low straights and ace-low straight flushes are not counted, the probabilities of each are reduced: straights and straight flushes each become 9/10 as common as they otherwise would be. The 4 missed straight flushes become flushes and the 1,020 missed straights become no pair.

Note that since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. For example, the hand 3♣ 7♣ 8♣ Q♠ A♠ is identical to 3♦ 7♦ 8♦ Q♥ A♥ because replacing all of the clubs in the first hand with diamonds and all of the spades with hearts produces the second hand. So eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values, there are only 134,459 distinct hands.

The number of distinct poker hands is even smaller. For example, 3♣ 7♣ 8♣ Q♠ A♠ and 3♦ 7♣ 8♦ Q♥ A♥ are not identical hands when just ignoring suit assignments because one hand has three suits, while the other hand has only two—that difference could affect the relative value of each hand when there are more cards to come. However, even though the hands are not identical from that perspective, they still form equivalent poker hands because each hand is an A-Q-8-7-3 high card hand. There are 7,462 distinct poker hands.

===7-card poker hands===
In some popular variations of poker such as Texas hold &#x27;em, the most widespread poker variant overall, a player uses the best five-card poker hand out of seven cards.

The frequencies are calculated in a manner similar to that shown for 5-card hands, except additional complications arise due to the extra two cards in the 7-card poker hand. The total number of distinct 7-card hands is formula_3. It is notable that the probability of a no-pair hand is &quot;lower&quot; than the probability of a one-pair or two-pair hand.

The Ace-high straight flush or royal flush is slightly more frequent (4324) than the lower straight flushes (4140 each) because the remaining two cards can have any value; a King-high straight flush, for example, cannot have the Ace of its suit in the hand (as that would make it ace-high instead).

(The frequencies given are exact; the probabilities and odds are approximate.)

Since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. Eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values leaves 6,009,159 distinct 7-card hands.

The number of distinct 5-card poker hands that are possible from 7 cards is 4,824. Perhaps surprisingly, this is fewer than the number of 5-card poker hands from 5 cards, as some 5-card hands are impossible with 7 cards (e.g. 7-high and 8-high).

===5-card lowball poker hands===
Some variants of poker, called lowball, use a low hand to determine the winning hand. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don&#x27;t count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5, also called a &quot;wheel&quot;. The probability is calculated based on formula_1, the total number of 5-card combinations. (The frequencies given are exact; the probabilities and odds are approximate.)

As can be seen from the table, just over half the time a player gets a hand that has no pairs, threes- or fours-of-a-kind. (50.7%)

If aces are not low, simply rotate the hand descriptions so that 6-high replaces 5-high for the best hand and ace-high replaces king-high as the worst hand.

Some players do not ignore straights and flushes when computing the low hand in lowball. In this case, the lowest hand is A-2-3-4-6 with at least two suits. Probabilities are adjusted in the above table such that &quot;5-high&quot; is not listed&quot;, &quot;6-high&quot; has one distinct hand, and &quot;King-high&quot; having 330 distinct hands, respectively. The Total line also needs adjusting.

===7-card lowball poker hands===
In some variants of poker a player uses the best five-card low hand selected from seven cards. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don&#x27;t count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5, also called a &quot;wheel&quot;. The probability is calculated based on formula_5, the total number of 7-card combinations.

The table does not extend to include five-card hands with at least one pair. Its &quot;Total&quot; represents the 95.4% of the time that a player can select a 5-card low hand without any pair.

(The frequencies given are exact; the probabilities and odds are approximate.)

If aces are not low, simply rotate the hand descriptions so that 6-high replaces 5-high for the best hand and ace-high replaces king-high as the worst hand.

Some players do not ignore straights and flushes when computing the low hand in lowball. In this case, the lowest hand is A-2-3-4-6 with at least two suits. Probabilities are adjusted in the above table such that &quot;5-high&quot; is not listed, &quot;6-high&quot; has 781,824 distinct hands, and &quot;King-high&quot; has 21,457,920 distinct hands, respectively. The Total line also needs adjusting.

<text>Slow playing (also called sandbagging or trapping) is a deceptive play in poker where a player bets weakly or passively with a strong holding. It is the opposite of fast playing. A flat call can be a form of slow playing. The objective of slow playing is to lure opponents into a pot who might fold to a raise, or to cause them to bet more strongly than they would if the player had played aggressively (bet or raised). Slow playing sacrifices protection against hands that may improve and risks losing the pot-building value of a bet if the opponent also checks. 

David Sklansky defines the following conditions for profitable slow plays:
* A player must have a very strong hand.
* The free card or cheap card the player is allowing to his opponents must have good possibilities of making them a second-best hand.
* That same free card must have little chance of giving an opponent a better hand or even giving them a draw to a better hand on the next round with sufficient pot odds to justify a call.
* The player must believe that he will drive out opponents by showing aggression, but can win a big pot if the opponents stay in the pot.
* The pot must not yet be very large.

:&quot;Seven-card stud example&quot;
:In a seven-card stud game, Ted&#x27;s first three cards are all fours. Alice with a king showing bets first, Ted raises and Alice calls. On the next round, Alice catches another king, and Ted miraculously catches the last four (making four-of-a-kind). Ted suspects Alice has two pair or three kings, and Alice suspects that Ted has two pair or three fours. Alice bets again, and Ted just flat calls. Ted decides to just call for next round or two, and maybe even check if Alice doesn&#x27;t bet, rather than raising, for several reasons. Ted&#x27;s hand is so strong that the chance of getting beaten is negligible, so he doesn&#x27;t need protection. If Alice just has two pair and Ted acts strongly, Alice may think Ted has three fours and fold if she doesn&#x27;t improve. By allowing Alice to continue for smaller stakes, Ted hopes that Alice will improve to a very strong (but second best) hand that will induce her to bet, raise, or at least call in the later betting rounds.

==Relationship between slow playing and bluffing==
Against observant opponents, the frequency of bluffing affects the effectiveness of slow playing, and vice versa. If a player&#x27;s table image is that of an aggressive bluffer, slow playing is less important because his opponents will be more willing to call his usual bets and raises. Similarly, if a player is perceived as a &quot;trappy&quot; player (uses frequent slow plays), his bluffs are less likely to be respected (i.e., more likely to be called) because his opponents expect him to slow play his strong hands.

==Check raising as a slow play==
A check-raise is not necessarily a slow play. Often, the purpose of a check-raise is to drive out opponents from a pot, which is the opposite of the goal of a slow play. However, within the context of a single betting round, check-raising can be employed as a slow play.

:&quot;Draw poker example&quot;
:Alice, Bob, Carol, and David are playing draw poker. After anteing, Alice starts with a pair of aces, and opens the betting for $2. Bob raises an additional $2, bringing the bet to $4. Carol folds. David calls the $4, and Alice puts in an additional $2 to match the raise. Drawing three cards, she receives another ace, and a pair of fives. Since her aces-full is almost certain to be unbeatable, it does not need the protection of a bet. Also, Bob earlier raised, and David called a raise, so they likely have strong hands and one of them will bet if Alice doesn&#x27;t. Finally, since Bob and David earlier showed strength, and they know that Alice knows this, Alice betting into them would be seen as a bold move likely to scare one or both of them off, especially if they weren&#x27;t as strong as they seem. Alice decides conditions are right for a slow play: Alice checks. As she hoped, Bob bets $2. David thinks for a minute, then calls the $2. Alice now springs the trap and raises $2. Bob calls the additional $2, and David (who now realizes that he is probably beaten) folds. Bob reveals three sixes, and surrenders the pot to Alice. If Alice had just bet her hand on the second round, it is likely that Bob would just have called and David may or may not have called, earning Alice $2 to $4 on the second round. But with the slow play, she earned $6.

Even in games (such as California lowball) where the check-raise is not allowed, one can make other sandbagging plays such as just flat calling instead of raising with a very strong hand and then later raising.

==Fishing for the overcall==
&quot;Fishing for the overcall&quot; occurs when the last card a player is dealt makes him a very strong hand, an opponent in front of him bets, and there are more opponents yet to act behind him. While the player might normally raise with his hand, just calling may encourage the opponents behind him to overcall when they would have folded to a raise. For this play to be used profitably, one or more conditions like the following must be met:
* The original bettor is all-in and therefore has no money to call a raise.
* The player is confident that the original bettor was bluffing and would not call a raise.
* There are several opponents yet to act. If there is only one opponent yet to act, then getting the overcall would gain no more money than raising and having the initial bettor call.
* The opponents are likely to overcall the initial bet, but not a raise. This play sacrifices the profit that might have been made from opponents who would have overcalled a raise.

A common example of fishing for overcalls occurs in High-low split games like Omaha hold &#x27;em. If John is confident that Mary is betting a high hand, then John might flat call with his low hand to fish for overcalls rather than make it more difficult for opponents to call. If John were to raise, he and Mary would gain no profit at all if no other opponents called.

<doc id="75710" wikidata="Q5088953" url="?curid=75710" title="Cheating in poker">
<text>Cheating in poker is any behavior outside the rules of poker that is intended to give an unfair advantage to one or more players.

==Minimal-skill methods==

The easiest and most common types of cheating require no skill of manipulation, but rather merely the nerve. Such methods include shorting the pot, avoiding house fees, and peeking at other players&#x27; cards. It is very difficult to prove because when confronted, at least the first time, the cheat often calls the cheating an honest mistake.

One minimal-skill method that occurs in non-casino and casino games happens when a player who has folded appoints themselves the tender of the pot, stacking chips, counting them, and delivering them to the winning player. &quot;Check-chopping&quot; is when such a &quot;helpful&quot; player palms a chip. Odorless adhesive can be used for this purpose.

Another minimal-skill method is going south (also known as &quot;ratholing&quot;), where a player covertly removes a portion of their chips from play while remaining in the game, normally in order to preserve the winnings as profit, or prevent a major loss in &quot;big bet&quot; games.

==Skilled methods ==

A cheat may &quot;hand-muck&quot; or palm one or more cards. When a cheat is &quot;mucking&quot; the cheat is cleverly hiding cards in their hand, to later switch their hand for. This may also be done with a confederate.

A skilled cheat can deal the second card, the bottom card, the second from bottom card, and the middle card. The idea is to &quot;cull&quot;, or to find the cards one needs, place them at the bottom, top, or any other place the cheat wants, then false deal them to oneself or one&#x27;s confederate.

One sign of false dealing could be when a dealer grips the deck with the index finger in front of it or their pinky and pointing finger on both short sides of the deck while the other fingers support the deck while the cards are being beveled slightly. This is referred to as the &quot;Mechanic&#x27;s grip&quot;. It not only allows better control of the cards, but provides cover by showing the back of the top card, and without moving the hand holding the deck.

A cheat can place certain cards in a position favorable to the card cheat. This is called &quot;stacking&quot;. Stacking is more often done than &quot;false dealing&quot; because it doesn&#x27;t look suspicious. There are a couple of techniques for &quot;stacking&quot; cards, the best known being riffle stacking and overhand stacking. In riffle stacking the cheat stacks the card(s) while doing a riffle shuffle. This form of stacking is the most difficult to master and the most respected under the card sharps and magicians. The overhand stacking method takes little practice, and is more likely to be done in a situation with a cheat. The cheat does (what looks like) a normal overhand shuffle. But while the cheat is shuffling they keep track of the cards they want to stack, and with a little practice they can manage to put the exact number of cards in between the cards they want to stack to make the next round of dealing favorable for the cheat. 

Even if a cheat deals themselves a powerful hand, they may not win much money if every other player has nothing, so often the cheat will stack two hands, with one player receiving a strong hand and the cheater getting an even stronger one. This is called a &quot;double duke&quot;.

A slight advantage for a cheat can be to know what cards are placed both on the top of the deck as well as the bottom card, so that information can then later be used to bottom deal or second deal themselves that card. The looking at the top or bottom card without the other players knowing or seeing it is called &quot;Glimpsing&quot; or &quot;Peeking&quot;. There are a lot of methods for reaching the same goal. A method that is used most is called the &quot;Shiner&quot;. A Shiner is a reflective object (such as coffee, a lighter, a blade etc.) that is placed under the deck, so when the cheat is looking into the shiner the bottom card is exposed, and every card that is dealt over the shiner can easily be peeked by looking in the shiner.

One method of cheating that involves both great risk and great potential pay-off is the cold deck—so called because it has not been &quot;warmed up&quot; by play (and thus randomised). Such decks are usually pre-stacked, and are introduced either at the deal, after the real deck has been shuffled, or before the deal, where a card sharp will make a false shuffle using sleight of hand. The latter method may require collusion or a pass if the style of play or house rules call for a cut. The skill lies both in convincing other players that the shuffle is legitimate and in ensuring that other players receive hands that are good enough to entice them into play, but not too good to arouse suspicion.

=== Marked cards ===
Marked cards are printed or altered so that the cheater can know the value of specific cards while only looking at the back. Ways of marking are too numerous to mention, but there are certain broad types. A common way of marking cards involves marks on a round design on the card so as to be read like a clock (an ace is marked at one o&#x27;clock, and so on until the king, which is not marked). Shading a card by putting it in the sun or scratching the surface with a razor are ways to mark an already printed deck.

&quot;Juice&quot; and &quot;daub&quot; are two kinds of substances that can be used to mark cards in a subtle way so as to avoid detection, when done properly. While a &quot;juice&quot; deck is premarked and introduced into play by the cheater, &quot;daub&quot; is applied during play to any deck. Once trained, cheaters can read the cards from across the table.

Decks can be marked while playing using fingernails, poker chips or by bending or &quot;crimping&quot; the cards in a position that the cheat can read from across the table. The practice of burning the top card, or cards, is to prevent a cheat from knowing that top card and dealing &quot;seconds&quot; to either give a confederate a card that helps their hand or an opponent a card that hurts theirs.

== Collusion ==
Collusion is two or more players acting with a secret, common strategy. Some common forms of collusion are: &quot;soft play&quot;, that is, failing to bet or raise in a situation that would normally merit it, to avoid costing one&#x27;s partner or friend money; &quot;whipsawing&quot;, where partners raise and re-raise each other to trap players in between; &quot;dumping&quot;, where a cheater will deliberately lose to a partner; and &quot;signalling&quot;, or trading information between partners via signals of some sort, like arranging their chips in a certain manner.

In a poker tournament, when one player is all in and two other players are active in the pot, it is common for the two players with chips left to &quot;check it down&quot;, or check on each round of betting through the end of the hand. Unless they explicitly communicate an agreement about checking it down, this is not collusion.

==Online specific==

Online play has allowed for new methods of cheating while other methods based on physical objects such as cards or chips are impossible.

One new form of cheating is the use of bots. These are programs that play instead of a real human. Though their accuracy and their ability to win are disputed, their use normally violates the rules of online cardrooms, so using them is, by definition, cheating.

Collusion in online poker is relatively easy and much more difficult to immediately spot if executed well. Cheaters can engage in telephone calls or instant messaging, discussing their cards, since nobody can see them. Sometimes one person may be using two or more computers to play multiple hands at the same table under different aliases (since many broadband plans offer customers multiple IP addresses, this can conveniently and cheaply be done without the likelihood of immediate detection). Such tactics can give cheaters an advantage that is difficult to work against. Online poker cardrooms keep records of every hand played, and collusion can often be detected by finding any of several detectable patterns (such as folding good hands to a small bet, as it is known that another player has a better hand). Users who frequently sit at the same tables will be flagged by poker rooms and their play will be closely monitored. Often, such users will be warned they have been flagged, in an effort to deter collusion.

Another online method of cheating is &quot;multiaccounting&quot;, where a player will register several accounts to their name (or, perhaps more commonly, to non-poker-playing friends and family members). This might be done to help enable the collusion previously mentioned, or perhaps to simply enable a well-known player to play incognito. Another common motive for multi-accounting is to facilitate chip dumping and other methods of equity maximization in online tournaments. A major difference between cash games and tournaments is that tournament winnings tend to be much less consistent over the short to medium term. Because tournaments tend to pay prize money only to the top ten percent of entrants on average and tend to pay the majority of prize money to a very small number of top finishers, in tournament play even the best players are prone to relatively long streaks of overall net losses (or even no winnings at all) between sizable wins. Therefore, for high-stakes players who specialize in tournament play, multi-accounting is one possible means to allow a player to play more entries in major tournaments than they would otherwise be able to, potentially multiplying the player&#x27;s earnings and, just as importantly, making earnings more consistent over a shorter period of time. This risks a large win by a hitherto unknown &quot;player&quot; attracting scrutiny from the host (and other players), especially if the winner has no known previous poker experience but does have clear ties to a better-known player. In addition, some sites now offer multi-table tournaments where the same player can enter multiple times under their own name, so as to reduce the incentive to multi-account.

Another concern is datamining. This is the systematic collection of hand histories, enough of which can be used to profile opponents using specially designed software. Two or more players may agree to share their individual hand histories amongst themselves; alternatively some websites offer large quantities of previously-played hands (even millions) for a fee. Using software to analyze one&#x27;s own histories is generally accepted. Acquiring histories of hands in which a player did not participate violates the rules of most cardrooms.

Poker software, like all software, cannot be assumed to be reliable. It is always possible that a person is exploiting the software to win money from victims. The software may even contain a backdoor which allows a person, perhaps an employee, to view cards. Absolute Poker was engaged in such a scandal along with site consultant and notable poker player Russ Hamilton. As of 2007, Ultimate Bet faces a lawsuit with allegations of employees exploiting the software. The user agreement of the two online poker sites owned by Tokwiro Enterprises, &quot;Absolute Poker&quot; and &quot;UltimateBet,&quot; state they reserve the right to cancel an account if a player plays &quot;in a professional sense&quot; (and not for personal entertainment only). This is not a standard prohibition. For example, it is not in the end-user agreements of the three largest online cardrooms: PokerStars, PartyPoker, and Full Tilt Poker.

==Angle shooting==

Angle shooting is engaging in actions that may technically be within the scope of the rules of the game, but that are considered unethical or unfair to exploit or take advantage of another player. For example, an angle shooter might motion as if they were folding their hand to induce other players to fold theirs out of turn.

One form of angle shooting which is exclusive to online poker is to abuse the disconnect protection (DP) rules most sites have in place. DP is a rule exclusive to online poker whereby if a player is disconnected from the site in the middle of the hand their hand is played out as if they were all-in without the player actually having to put any more money in the pot. The online poker rooms that offer DP usually have specific tables set aside for this so that all players at the table are aware that the special DP rules will apply.

How this is used by angle shooters is if a player is in a hand that they are unsure if they have the best cards and don&#x27;t want to invest any more money to find out. They can unplug their internet connection and then wait for the hand to play itself out. On a DP table the remaining cards in the hand would be dealt and the pot would be awarded to the player with the best cards. If there were multiple opponents in the hand then they would be eligible for a side pot.

Another example is when a player says nothing when betting, pushes in a raise, then says he made an error (a/k/a &quot;misclick&quot;) &amp; meant to just call. The opposing player(s) may take this as a sign of weakness and then re-raise or simply call when they shouldn&#x27;t, as the player may actually have &quot;the nuts&quot; (the best possible hand based on the cards in play). This could be done in reverse via a bluff by betting without announcing the bet &amp; betting less than the minimum call, then when the underbet is realized by the dealer, the player can claim they thought they raised, but the player apparently miscounted and bet less than the required call, which is then required to be increased to become a call. This makes the player appear strong and may induce a fold to the player&#x27;s weak hand.

<text>The Conciergerie () () is a former courthouse and prison in Paris, France, located on the west of the Île de la Cité, below the Palais de Justice. It was originally part of the former royal palace, the Palais de la Cité, which also included the Sainte-Chapelle. Two large medieval halls remain from the royal palace. During the French Revolution, 2,780 prisoners, including Marie Antoinette, were imprisoned, tried and sentenced at the Conciergerie, then sent to different sites to be executed by the guillotine. It is now a national monument and museum.

==Gallo-Roman fortress to Royal Palace (1st to 10th century AD)==

In the 1st-3rd century AD, the Ile de la Cité became part of the Gallo-Roman city of Lutetia, on the opposite bank of the Seine. The island was surrounded by a wall, and a fortress of the Roman governor was built at the west end of the island. The Merovingian King Clovis installed his capital there, on the site of the Roman fortress, from 508 until his death in 511. The Carolingian monarchs moved their capital out of the city, but at the end of the 10th century, under Hugh Capet, Paris became the capital of the Kingdom of France. He constructed a large new fortified residence, the Palais de la Cité, on the same site.

== Capetian Palace (11th-14th century) ==
From the 11th to the 14th century, the palace was enlarged and embellished, and gained in importance in the administration of the kingdom. Before he departed on the Third Crusade, Philip II of France delegated his legal authority the Curia Regis, which had regular assemblies, called Parlements, in the Hall of the King, to dispense justice. He moved the royal archives to the building, giving it even greater importance, and named a Concierge, or custodian, to oversee the administration of the palace, which gave the building its name. Philip II created the towered façade on the Seine river side and the great hall. The great hall, with its two side-by-side naves, was used for royal ceremonies and judicial sessions. At one end was an immense table of black marble from Germany, decorated with fleurs-de-lis emblems. A piece of the table is now displayed on the wall of the lower hall. The hall was also decorated with polychrome wooden statues of the kings of France. The &quot;Grand Chronicles of France&quot; by Jehan de Jandun described &quot;A new palace, a marvelous and costly work, the most beautiful that France has ever seen.&quot; The only surviving portions of the great hall are the Hall of the Men-at-arms and the Hall of the Guards below.

Philip IV continued the rebuilding between 1285 and 1314. The Grand Hall was built, replacing a smaller earlier hall. The Grand Chamber became the official seat of the Parliament; and he added the silver tower and the Tower of Caesar.

Under Charles V (1364–80), the role of the building changed. He decided to move his residence to the Louvre Castle, and the Hotel Saint-Pol. The concierge of the old palace was given greater authority over lower and middle courts. Prison cells were gradually added to the lower parts of the building, and it became known as the &quot;Conciergerie&quot;. Its prisoners were a mixture of common criminals and political prisoners. In common with other prisons of the time, the treatment of prisoners was dependent on their wealth, status and associates. Wealthy or influential prisoners usually got their own cells with a bed, desk and materials for reading and writing. Less-well-off prisoners could afford to pay for simply furnished cells known as &quot;pistoles&quot;, which would be equipped with a rough bed and perhaps a table. The poorest would be confined to dark, damp, vermin-infested cells known as &quot;oubliettes&quot; (literally &quot;forgotten places&quot;). In keeping with the name, they were left to live or die in conditions that were ideal for the plague and other infectious diseases, which were rife in the unsanitary conditions of the prison.

==15th-18th century==
Without the king as a permanent resident, the buildings underwent many changes to fit its judicial and prison role. Louis XII had the Chamber des Comptes reconstructed, and redecorated the Grand Chamber, used by the Parlement of Paris. A flood of the Seine in the winter of 1689-1690 caused damage to the lower building, while a fire in 1737 destroyed the Chamber des Comptes. It was rebuilt by Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Another fire within the palace in 1776 caused even greater damage, reaching the chamber of the king, the gallery of merchants, and the main tower. The reconstruction following the 1776 fire added new cells to the ground level of the Conciergerie, and replaced the 12th century oratory with the present Chapel.

==The Conciergerie and the Reign of Terror==
The Palais de la Cité and the Conciergerie played a central role in the French Revolution. On May 5, 1788, The Parlement of Paris, meeting in the Great Hall in 1788, refused to accept King Louis XVI&#x27;s order to turn over two of its members for questioning and refused to leave the building. As the Revolution unfolded, The Parlement itself soon became unpopular. It was dismissed in 1790 by the new Constituent Assembly, and the gates of the Palais de la Cité were locked.

The first Paris Commune and Sans-culottes seized the Tuileries Palace on August 10, 1792, and took charge of the government and the Conciergerie. During the September Massacres, the Communard militants entered the city&#x27;s prisons and in four days killed more than 1300 prisoners, including priests and others suspected of being upper class or hostile to the revolution. The victims included a large group executed in the Women&#x27;s Courtyard of the Conciergerie on September 2–3, 1792.

The Revolutionary Tribunal was created on March 10, 1793, by the more radical Montagnard faction over the opposition of the more moderate Girondins. The Tribunal met in the Grand Chamber of Palace, on the upper floor between the Silver and Caesar towers. It was renamed the &quot;Hall of Liberty.&quot; Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville, a Montagnard, was named public prosecutor, and installed his office and residence next to the Chamber. In September 1793, the Terror intensified. The National Convention, controlled by the Montagnards, enacted the Law of Suspects on September 17, 1793. This act declared that anyone considered a counter-revolutionary or enemy of the republic was guilty of treason and, thus, condemned to death. The Tribunal had five judges and twelve selected jury members. Trials were public and rapid, and attracted large crowds. Verdicts could not be appealed. The number of monthly executions grew from eleven a month before the Law of Suspects to one hundred twenty-four a month.

The Queen, Marie Antoinette, was arrested on August 3, 1792, and first held in the Temple Prison with her family. The King was tried between December 3 and December 26, 1792, and executed 21 January 1793. The Queen was transferred from the Temple to the Conciergerie on the night of August 1–2, 1793. She was confined in a single-bed cell on the ground floor overlooking the Women&#x27;s Courtyard. She was not allowed any writing instruments, and was continually watched by two gendarmes. After several unsuccessful plots to free her were discovered, she was transferred to a different cell, where the current memorial chapel is located, and held there for forty-four days. She was questioned in her cell on October 12, and was charged with three crimes: collusion with Austria, excessive expenditure, and opposing the Revolution. Another charge, having incestuous relations with her son, was added during the trial. Her trial began on October 14, 1793, in the former Great Hall of the Palace. She had two court-appointed lawyers, but they were only allowed less than a day to prepare their case. The trial lasted for two days, in which forty-one witnesses testified. The trial concluded on 16 October 1793; she was, as expected, sentenced to death, and taken in a cart later that day to the guillotine, set up on Place de la Revolution, now Place de la Concorde.

During the period of 1793–94, at the height of the Reign of Terror, the prison held some six hundred prisoners. Most prisoners were transferred to the Conciergerie from other prisons, and spent only a few days before their trial and sentencing, or at most a few weeks. Political and criminal prisoners were mixed together. Poorer prisoners were confined in collective cells on the lowest level, with straw-covered floors. These prisoners were called &quot;Pailleaux&quot;, or &quot;Straw sleepers.&quot; Others were confined to a square cell six feet wide and six feet long, with a narrow barred window. A small number of wealthier prisoners were able to bribe guards to have cells with two folding beds. These prisoners could send and receive mail, have their clothes washed, and sometime have visitors. These prisoners were called &quot;Pistoliers,&quot; because they bribed the guards with pistole coins. However, these privileges ceased as the prison became more crowded and the Terror reached its peak.

In the spring of 1794, the tribunal began judging the moderate revolutionary leaders, including Danton and Camille Desmoulins. In May they tried and sentenced Élisabeth of France, sister of Louis XVI, &quot;For belonging to the Family of the Tyrant.&quot; On June 10, 1794, the court procedure was modified to allow speedier trials; witnesses were no longer needed, and the definition of &quot;suspect&quot; was enlarged. By the end of June, an average of thirty-eight persons a day were being tried, sentenced, and sent to the guillotine. Between 1793 and 1795, two-thirds of prisoners tried were sentenced to death. At the peak of the Reign of Terror, four out of five prisoners were sentenced to death,

By the end of July 1794, the more moderate revolutionaries, fearing their own safety, turned against Robespierre and the other radical leaders. On July 27, a majority of the Convention voted for the arrest of Robespierre. Robespierre tried to commit suicide, was wounded, and was taken to the Conciergerie, where he was given the former cell of Marie Antoinette. On July 28 he was condemned to death by the Tribunal and guillotined on the Place de la Revolution.

In August, the head of the tribunal, Fouquier-Tinville, was arrested and tried. He argued that &quot;the execution of the laws, justice and humanity were always my sole rules of conduct&quot;, but he was confined for nine months in the Conciergerie, and went to the guillotine on May 7, 1795. The tribunal was abolished on May 31, 1795. In seven hundred eighty days, the tribunal had sentenced and executed 2,780 prisoners.

The early revolutionary period continued the prison&#x27;s tradition of interning prisoners based on wealth, such that wealthier prisoners could rent a bed for 27 livres 12 sous for the first month, 22 livres 10 sous for subsequent months. Even when the price was decreased to 15 livres, the commanders of the prison made a fortune; as the Terror escalated, a prisoner could pay for a bed and be executed a few days later, freeing the bed for a new inmate who would then pay as well. One memoirist termed the Conciergerie &quot;the most lucrative furnished lodgings in Paris&quot;. For most prisoners, the cramped cells were infested with rats, and the stench of urine permeated every room. As the Terror reached its peak, the special privileges for wealthy prisoners were largely reduced and ceased.

The prisoners, except those locked in the dungeons, were allowed to walk about the prisoners&#x27; gallery from 8 a.m. to an hour before sunset. Roll call was always a tortuous proceeding because many of the jailers were illiterate and it could take hours for them to confirm that all of the prisoners were accounted for. A principal jailer, who sat by the door, determined whether visitors would be allowed inside the prison. His decision depended more on his mood than any set proceedings. He was also in charge of resolving disputes between jailers and their charges.

Each evening, the prisoners gathered in the courtyard outside the Tour Bonbec to hear the reading of the list of prisoners who would be tried the following day. Once prisoners were tried and sentenced, they were taken to Salle de la Toilette, where their personal belongings were confiscated. They were put onto carts in the May Courtyard and taken to guillotines at sites throughout Paris. Some of the prisoners held at the Conciergerie were the poet André Chénier, Charlotte Corday, Madame Élisabeth, Madame du Barry, and the 21 Girondins, a group of moderate deputies, arrested and executed in the early beginning of the Reign of Terror.

==19th century to present==
After the Restoration of the Bourbons in 1814 and again in 1815, after the Hundred Days reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, the Conciergerie returned to its role as a courthouse and prison. Its prisoners included Marshal Ney, one of Napoleon&#x27;s Generals, who was sentenced there for breaking an oath to King Louis XVIII and joining Napoleon&#x27;s during the Hundred Days; Georges Cadoudal, leader of the Chouannerie Breton royalist uprising, and the anarchist Ravachol. Later prisoners included the future Napoleon III, who was tried there in 1840 after a failed attempt to seize power, and sentenced to prison for life in the prison of Ham, from which he escaped.

Beginning in 1812, the palace and portions of the Conciergerie were restored and rebuilt by architect A.M. Peyrle. His additions included the memorial chapel to Marie Antoinette. In 1847, work began on an enlarged Palace of Justice, with a new Court of Summary Jurisdiction placed between the Silver Tower and the Tour Bombec. In 1862 the Conciergerie was granted the status of an historical monument, though it still continued to be used as a prison. Between 1847 and 1871 the architects Joseph-Louis Duc and Étienne Thédore Dommey built a new façade for the Ministry of Justice, facing the Boulevard du Palais; built a new building for the Correctional Police; reconstructed the historic Salle des Pas-Perdus and restored the clock tower, and built a new building next to the Conciergerie for the Cour de Cassation. At the same time they went to work restoring the medieval halls of the Conciergerie, and in 1870 raised the height of the clock tower. Their work was interrupted by the uprising of the Paris Commune in 1871. In the final days of the Commune, the Communards set fire to the new Palais de Justice, badly damaging the interiors. Restoration and reconstruction lasted for another twenty years. The palace was finally completed with the finishing of the Tribunal correctionnel between 1904 and 1914. Some sections of the Conciergerie were opened to tourist visits in 1914. The prison continued to function until 1934, when it was definitively closed. 

The prison was one of the backdrops for the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, with a tableau that referenced the beheading of Marie Antoinette and the Reign of Terror, with performances by metal band Gojira and opera singer Marina Viotti.

== Description ==
=== The Towers and facades ===
The four medieval towers of the north façade, along the Quai de l&#x27;Horloge between the Cour de Cassation and the Boulevard du Palais, are the most prominent exterior vestiges of the old Conciergerie.

The Tour Bonbec is a circular tower with battlements and a conical slate roof located at the west end of the Conciergerie, next to the Cour de Cassation. It is the oldest of the towers, constructed in the 13th century under Louis IX. It was originally one level shorter than the other towers, but in the 19th century, under Napoleon III, it was raised to its present height and form. The name of the tower comes from &quot;Bon Bec,&quot; a slang word for a &quot;Good talker&quot;. It is reference to the torture chamber, which during the Reign of Terror was located in this tower; it referred to those prisoners who spoke freely under torture.

The gateway on the north is flanked by two circular towers with conical roofs, but without battlements. The Caesar Tower, on the left facing the building, is named in honor of the Roman Emperors, particularly Julius Caesar who visited the island during the Gallic Wars to meet with the leaders of the Gallic tribes, and the later Emperors and Roman governors who lived on the island. The two towers were constructed in the early 14th century by Philippe IV. Later in the 14th century, the lower portions of the towers were connected to the prison of the Conciergerie, and were used as dungeons until the French Revolution. The Silver Tower on the right was used to store part of the royal treasury. After the court moved to Versailles, The upper parts of the two towers were attached to the Grand Chamber of the Parlement, and were used to store the civil and criminal registries of the kingdom. In 1793–94, at the height of the Terror, the chief prosecutor of the Revolutionary Tribunal, Antoine Fouquier-Tinville, had his offices in the two towers, close to the courtroom of the Tribunal.

The most recent tower is the Tour de l&#x27;Horloge, or clock tower, at the corner of the Boulevard du Palais and the Quai de l&#x27;Horloge. It was completed by John II of France, and finished in 1350. It is the tallest tower of the Conciergerie, five levels high, with battlements and a lantern tower at the top; it served as both a watchtower and clock tower. The clock was installed during the reign of Charles VI of France, and was the first public clock in Paris. In 1585 King Henry III of France embellished the clock with a new face, set on a blue background with gold Fleurs-de-lis, and framed by statues of law and justice by sculptor Germain Pilon. The decoration was vandalised during the Revolution, and the large bell in the lantern, which was rung to celebrate major events, was taken out and melted down. The tower had been restored several times, most recently in 2012.

The current façades were built later than the towers. The north façade between the towers was built in the 19th century in Gothic Revival style. The eastern section, around the entrance, was built during the Bourbon Restoration in the early 19th century, while the western section was built by Joseph-Louis Duc and Étienne Théodore Dommey in the second half of the 19th century, under Emperor Napoleon III. They were almost completed in 1871, when the Paris Commune took charge of the city. The Communards set the building on fire in the last days of the Commune, badly damaging the interiors, but it was rebuilt in the late 19th century.

=== The Hall of the Men-at-Arms and the &quot;Rue de Paris&quot; ===

The Hall of the Men-at-Arms (Salle des Gens d&#x27;Armes) was built in early 14th century by Philip IV on the ground floor. Its great size (originally long, now , wide, and high to the vault), makes it the largest non-religious Gothic hall in Europe. It served as a dining room and gathering place for the armed guards and servants attached to the palace, who numbered between one and two thousand persons. During the reign of Philip IV parts of the hall were sometimes used for the meetings of special commissions appointed by the King to investigate problems in the royal institutions in the French provinces. These parts would be separated from the rest of the hall by partitions or tapestries during the meetings.

The hall particularly provided staff and services for the Great Hall, located directly above it on the first floor. The lower hall was connected with upper hall by spiral staircases; part of one stairway is still in place. The hall was divided into four naves by a row of massive pillars in the center, flanked by two rows of cylindrical columns. Heat was provided by four large fireplaces around the hall. Thanks to the support of the columns and pillars, the hall originally had large windows, which were mostly sealed off in the 17th century when the Galerie Dauphine was built, though traces of them are still visible on the south wall.

In 1364, when Charles V left the palace, the hall was modified for its new prison functions. the last bay on the west was raised in height and separated by bars from the rest of the hall. This became the &quot;Rue de Paris&quot;, the secure route to the prison cells, named after &quot;Monsieur de Paris&quot;, the nickname of the city&#x27;s executioner.

===Hall of the Guards===

The Hall of the Guards (Salle des Gardes) was built by Philip IV at the same time as the Hall of the Men-at-Arms, in the early 14th century. It is on the north or the old palace, between the Tower of Caesar and Silver Tower and the Seine, and the private garden of the King on the west. It was first occupied by The Royal Guard, and later was used as the antechamber of the Parliament, which was located directly above. It is smaller than the Hall of the Men-art-Arms, 21.8 meters long, 11.7 meters wide, and 8.3 meters high. The rib-vaulted roof, supported by three massive pillars, divides it into two naves. Like the hall of the Men-at-Arms, it was connected with the room above by a spiral stairway.

When King Charles V moved the royal residence from the City Palace to the Louvre, the Hall of the Guards was converted into a prison. It was divided into dungeons for destitute prisoners. called &quot;pailleux&quot; or &quot;Straw-sleepers&quot;, who were fed with only bread and water, and slept on the floor. It was usually overcrowded, with prisoners sometimes required to sleep in shifts. From 1780 onwards, male prisoners were able to get some exercise in the neighbouring courtyard. During the Reign of Terror, the Hall was used to confine prisoners before their trials in the courtroom of the Revolutionary Tribunal, in the hall above. The cells became so crowded that a second level, built of wood and accessed by ladders, was put into place. The Hall was restored in the 19th century by architect Antoine Marie Peyrle, who added some decorative details, including sculpture on the capitals of the columns.

===Kitchen===
The kitchen pavilion was added in about 1353, shortly after the other large halls. Placed in the northwest corner, it was set slightly apart from the rest of the building, to reduce the risk of fire. It was originally installed on two levels, with the food of the royal family and guests prepared on the upper level, and for the staff on the lower level. When the king was in residence, meals were prepared in a large hearth on the upper floor, or prepared in the lower kitchen and taken upstairs on an outside ramp, no longer extant. The kitchen originally had eight large windows, but all but two were walled up after it became a prison. Sometimes both the upper and lower kitchens were employed for an event, such as the Banquet of the Three Kings on 6 January 1378, held by Charles V to welcome his uncle, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and his cousin Wenceslaus, King of the Romans. The upstairs and downstairs kitchens worked together to prepare a banquet of three courses with ten dishes in each course, served in the Grand Hall to the royal guests and to eight hundred German and French knights.

=== Prisoners&#x27; Corridor ===

The upper level of the Conciergerie was considerably rebuilt in the 19th and 20th century. Nearly all of the original cells, including that of Marie Antoinette, were demolished and replaced with new rooms. After the prison was closed and became a museum, some of the new rooms were turned into galleries. In 1989 three rooms were recreated to depict the administrative function of the prison. The first is the cell-like office of the registrar who received the incoming prisoners, enter their names into a large book, and take their belongings. This office was originally located on the ground floor, near the Cour du Mai, the main entrance of prison, where prisoners arrived. Prisoners were then taken to their cells along the Prisoner&#x27;s Corridor, which extended the length of the building. Next to the recreated registrar&#x27;s office is a recreation of the office of the Concierge, the warden of the prison. The third recreated room is the Grooming Room, where prisoners were taken on the day of their execution. They undressed and put on a special collarless tunic, and their hair was cut to make easier the passage of the guillotine blade through their neck.

In addition to these rooms, the corridor has three recreations of prison cells, and four rooms displaying objects and documents illustrating the history of the building and the major events of Revolution.

=== Hall of Names and Prisoner&#x27;s Chapel ===
The Hall of Names has walls covered with the names of more than four thousand persons who were tried and sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal. Most of the prisoners came from middle or lower class, though twenty percent were from the former nobility and clergy. Between spring 1793 and 1794, nearly half the prisoners tried by the Tribunal left the prison alive, but that number dropped to only twenty percent between spring 1793 and 1794, the period of the Reign of Terror. Visitors can use a touch screen to consult the biographies of fifty famous prisoners executed during the Terror.

The Prisoner&#x27;s Chapel was rebuilt in 1776, after a fire that destroyed the earlier oratory. It is little changed from the time of the Revolution. The altar, confessional and the large crucifix date to the 18th century. Women could attend the services seated separately on the upper level, behind bars. Black curtains behind the altar cover the entrance to the memorial chapel dedicated to Marie Antoinette. The chapel was probably used as a cell during the Terror, when the prison was particularly overcrowded.

=== Memorial Chapel or Marie Antoinette Chapel ===

The original cell of Marie Antoinette was destroyed after the restoration of the monarchy and was replaced in 1815 by the Memorial Chapel, dedicated to her, on the site of her cell. It was commissioned by Louis XVIII, brother of the executed Louis XVI, It contains a marble monument dedicated to the Queen, with &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Testament&quot;, and three paintings of the Queen depicting her imprisonment. The only light in the chapel comes from a single stained glass window, and the black faux-marble walls are marked with stone teardrops.

=== Women&#x27;s Courtyard ===

The Women&#x27;s courtyard, where Marie Antoinette and other women prisoners were allowed to exercise, is little changed from the time of the Revolution. The arcades, garden, stone table, and fountain where prisoners could wash their garments, date from that period. At the back of the garden, in the northeast corner, is a small triangular area separated from the women&#x27;s courtyard by a gate. This area belonged to the men&#x27;s prison, and was probably used for the secure transfer of prisoners.

<text>Lowball or low poker is a variant of poker in which the normal ranking of hands is inverted. Several variations of lowball poker exist, differing in whether aces are treated as high cards or low cards, and whether straights and flushes are used.

==Low-poker ranking==
Lowball inverts the normal ranking of poker hands. There are three methods of ranking low hands, called ace-to-five low, deuce-to-seven low, and ace-to-six low. The &#x27;ace-to-five&#x27; method is most common. A sub-variant within this category is &#x27;high-low poker&#x27;, in which the highest and lowest hands split the pot, with the highest hand taking any odd chips if the pot does not divide equally. Sometimes straights and/or flushes count in determining which hand is highest but not in determining which hand is lowest, being reckoned as a no-pair hand in the latter instance, so that a player with such a holding can win both ways and thus take the entire pot.

==Lowball variants==
The most popular forms of lowball are ace-to-five lowball (also known as California lowball), and deuce-to-seven lowball (also known as Kansas City lowball). Ace-to-five lowball gets its name because the best hand at that form is 5-4-3-2-A. In ace-to-five lowball straights and flushes do not prevent a hand from being low. You win by simply having the five lowest cards. Deuce-to-seven lowball gets its name because the best hand at that form is 7-5-4-3-2 (not of the same suit).

===Ace-to-five===
Ace-to-five low is the most common method for evaluating low hands in poker, nearly universal in U.S. casinos, especially in high-low split games.

As in all low hand games, pairs count against the player. That is, any hand with no pair defeats any hand with a pair; one pair hands defeat two pair or three of a kind, etc. No-pair hands are compared starting with the highest-ranking card, just as in high poker, except that the high hand loses. In ace-to-five low, straights and flushes are ignored, and aces play as the lowest card.

For example, the hand 8-5-4-3-2 defeats 9-7-6-4-3, because eight-high is lower than nine-high. The hand 7-6-5-4-3 defeats both, because seven-high is lower still, even though it would be a straight if played for high. Aces are low, so 8-5-4-3-A defeats 8-5-4-3-2. Also, A-A-9-5-3 (a pair of aces) defeats 2-2-5-4-3 (a pair of deuces), but both of those would lose to any no-pair hand such as K-J-8-6-4. In the rare event that hands with pairs tie, kickers are used just as in high poker (but reversed): 3-3-6-4-2 defeats 3-3-6-5-A.

This is called ace-to-five low because the lowest (and therefore best) possible hand is 5-4-3-2-A, called a &quot;wheel&quot;. The next best possible hand is 6-4-3-2-A, followed by 6-5-3-2-A, 6-5-4-2-A, 6-5-4-3-A, 6-5-4-3-2, 7-4-3-2-A, 7-5-3-2-A, etc.

When speaking, low hands are referred to by their highest-ranking card or cards. Any nine-high hand can be called &quot;a nine&quot;, and is defeated by any &quot;eight&quot;. Two cards are frequently used: the hand 8-6-5-4-2 can be called &quot;an eight-six&quot; and will defeat &quot;an eight-seven&quot; such as 8-7-5-4-A.

Another common notation is calling a particular low hand &quot;smooth&quot; or &quot;rough&quot;. A smooth low hand is one where the remaining cards after the highest card are themselves very low; a rough low hand is one where the remaining cards are high. For instance, 8-7-6-3-A would be referred to as a &quot;rough eight&quot;, but 8-4-3-2-A would be referred to as a &quot;smooth eight&quot;. Some players refer to a hand containing a 4-3-2-A (in ace-to-five low or ace-to-six low) or a 5-4-3-2 (in deuce-to-seven low) as a &quot;nut&quot; (thus, in ace-to-five or ace-to-six, a 7-4-3-2-A would be called a &quot;seven nut&quot;).

High-low split games with ace-to-five low are usually played cards speak, that is, without a declaration. Frequently a qualifier is required for low (typically 8-high or 9-high). Some hands (particularly small straights and flushes) may be both the low hand and the high hand, and are particularly powerful (or particularly dangerous if they are mediocre both ways). Winning both halves of the pot in a split-pot game is called &quot;scooping&quot; or &quot;hogging&quot; the pot. The perfect hand in such a game is called a &quot;steel wheel&quot;, 5-4-3-2-A of one suit, which plays both as perfect low and a straight flush high. Note that it is possible—though unlikely—to have this hand and still lose money. If the pot has three players, and one other player has a mixed-suit wheel, and a third has better straight flush, the higher straight flush wins the high half of the pot, and the two wheels split the low half, hence the steel wheel wins only a quarter of a three-way pot.

Ace-to-five lowball, a five-card draw variant, is often played with a joker added to the deck. The joker plays as the lowest card not already present in the hand (in other words, it is a wild card): 7-5-4-Joker-A, for example, the joker plays as a 2. This can cause some interesting effects for high-low split games. Let&#x27;s say that Alice has 6-5-4-3-2 (called a &quot;straight six&quot;)--a reasonably good hand for both high and low. Burt has Joker-6-5-4-3. By applying the rule for wild cards in straights, Burt&#x27;s joker plays as a 7 for high, giving him a seven-high straight to defeat Alice&#x27;s six-high straight. For low, the joker plays as an ace—the lowest card not in Burt&#x27;s hand—and his hand also defeats Alice for low, because his low hand is 6-5-4-3-A, lower than her straight six by one notch. Jokers are very powerful in high-low split games.

====Wheel====
A wheel or bicycle is the poker hand 5-4-3-2-A, regardless of suit, which is a five-high straight, the lowest-ranking of the straights.

In ace-to-five low poker, where aces are allowed to play as low and straights and flushes do not count against a hand&#x27;s &quot;low&quot; status, this is the best possible hand. In high/low split games, it is both the best possible low hand and a competitive high hand. The best deuce-to-seven low hand, 7-5-4-3-2, is also sometimes called &quot;the wheel&quot;.

===Ace-to-six===
Ace-to-six low is not as commonly used as the ace-to-five low method, but it is common among home games in the eastern region of the United States, some parts of the mid-west, and also common in the United Kingdom (it is the traditional ranking of London lowball, a stud poker variant).

As in all lowball games, pairs and trips are bad: that is, any hand with no pair defeats any hand with a pair; one pair hands defeat two pair or trips, etc. No-pair hands are compared starting with the highest-ranking card, just as in high poker, except that the high hand loses. In ace-to-six low, straights and flushes are accounted for (as compared to Ace-to-five) and count as high (and are therefore bad), and aces play as the lowest card.

For example, the hand 8-5-4-3-2 defeats 9-7-6-4-3, because eight-high is lower than nine-high. The hand 7-6-5-4-2 defeats both, because seven-high is lower still. The hand 7-6-5-4-3 would lose, because it is a straight. Aces are low, so 8-5-4-3-A defeats 8-5-4-3-2. Also, A-A-9-5-3 (a pair of aces) defeats 2-2-5-4-3 (a pair of deuces), but both of those would lose to any no-pair hand such as K-J-8-6-4. In the rare event that hands with pairs tie, kickers are used just as in high poker (but reversed): 3-3-6-4-2 defeats 3-3-6-5-A.

It is called ace-to-six low because the best possible hand is 6-4-3-2-A (also known as a Chicago Wheel or a 64), followed by 6-5-3-2-A, 6-5-4-2-A, 6-5-4-3-A, 7-4-3-2-A, 7-5-3-2-A, etc.

When speaking, low hands are referred to by their highest-ranking card or cards. Any nine-high hand can be called &quot;a nine&quot;, and is defeated by any &quot;eight&quot;. Two cards are frequently used: the hand 8-6-5-4-2 can be called &quot;an eight-six&quot; and will defeat &quot;an eight-seven&quot; such as 8-7-5-4-A.

A wild card plays as whatever rank would make the lowest hand. Thus, in 6-5-Joker-2-A, the joker plays as a 3, while in Joker-5-4-3-2 it would play as a 7 (an ace or six would make a straight).

High-low split games with ace-to-six low are usually played with a declaration.

===Deuce-to-seven===
Deuce-to-seven low is often called Kansas City lowball (the no-limit single-draw variation) or just &quot;low poker&quot;. It is almost the direct opposite of standard poker: high hand loses. It is not as commonly used as the ace-to-five low method.

As in all lowball games, pairs and trips are bad: that is, any hand with no pair defeats any hand with a pair; one pair hands defeat two pair or trips, etc. No-pair hands are compared starting with the highest-ranking card, just as in high poker, except that the high hand loses. In deuce-to-seven low, straights and flushes count as high (and are therefore bad). Aces are always high (and therefore bad).

For example, the hand 8-5-4-3-2 defeats 9-7-6-4-3, because eight-high is lower than nine-high. The hand 7-6-5-4-2 defeats both, because seven-high is lower still. The hand 7-6-5-4-3 would lose, because it is a straight. Aces are high, so Q-8-5-4-3 defeats A-8-5-4-3. In the rare event that hands with pairs tie, kickers are used just as in high poker (but reversed): 3-3-6-4-2 defeats 3-3-6-5-2.

Since the ace always plays high, A-5-4-3-2 (also called the Nut Ace) is not considered a straight; is simply ace-high no pair (it would therefore lose to any king-high, but would defeat A-6-4-3-2).

The best possible hand is 7-5-4-3-2 (hence the name deuce-to-seven low), followed by 7-6-4-3-2, 7-6-5-3-2, 7-6-5-4-2, 8-5-4-3-2, 8-6-4-3-2, etc. Hands are sometimes referred to by their absolute rank, e.g. 7-5-4-3-2 (#1, said &#x27;number one&#x27;, see table).
When speaking, low hands are referred to by their highest-ranking card or cards. Any nine-high hand can be called &quot;a nine&quot;, and is defeated by any &quot;eight&quot;. Two cards are frequently used: the hand 8-6-5-4-2 can be called &quot;an eight-six&quot; and will defeat &quot;an eight-seven&quot; such as 8-7-5-4-2.

Another common notation is calling a particular low hand &quot;smooth&quot; or &quot;rough&quot;. A smooth low hand is one where the remaining cards after the highest card are themselves very low; a rough low hand is one where the remaining cards are high. For instance, 8-7-6-4-2 would be referred to as a &quot;rough eight&quot;, but 8-5-4-3-2 would be referred to as a &quot;smooth eight&quot;.

Wild cards are rarely used in deuce-to-seven games, but if used they play as whatever rank would make the lowest hand. Thus, in 7-6-Joker-3-2, the joker plays as a 4, while in Joker-5-4-3-2 it would play as a 7 (a six would make a straight).

High-low split games with deuce-to-seven low are usually played with a declaration.

<text>Jean-Pierre Jeunet (; born 3 September 1953) is a French film director and screenwriter. His films combine fantasy, realism, and science fiction to create idealized realities or to give relevance to mundane situations.

Jeunet debuted as a director with the acclaimed 1991 black comedy &quot;Delicatessen,&quot; collaborating with Marc Caro. Jeunet then co-wrote and -directed with Caro again on &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; (1995). His work with science fiction and horror led him to direct &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997), the fourth film in the &quot;Alien&quot; film series and his first and thus far only experience with an American film. In 2001, Jeunet achieved his biggest success with the release of &quot;Amélie&quot;, which won him international acclaim; the film reached BBC&#x27;s 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century.

Jeunet is widely regarded as one of the most influential and important directors in modern French cinema, and his critical and commercial success has earned him two Academy Award nominations.

==Life and career==
Jean-Pierre Jeunet was born in Roanne, France. He bought his first camera at the age of 17 and made short films while studying animation at Cinémation Studios. He befriended Marc Caro, a designer and comic book artist who became his longtime collaborator and co-director. They met at an animation festival in Annecy in the 1970s.

Together, Jeunet and Caro directed award-winning animations. Their first live-action film was &quot;The Bunker of the Last Gunshots&quot; (1981), a short film about soldiers in a bleak futuristic world. Jeunet also directed numerous advertisements and music videos, such as Jean-Michel Jarre&#x27;s &quot;Zoolook&quot; (together with Caro).

Jeunet&#x27;s films often resonate with the late twentieth-century French film movement &quot;cinéma du look&quot; and allude to themes and aesthetics involving German expressionism, French poetic realism, and the French New Wave.

Jeunet and Caro&#x27;s first feature film was &quot;Delicatessen&quot; (1991), a melancholy comedy set in a famine-plagued post-apocalyptic world, in which an apartment building above a delicatessen is ruled by a butcher who kills people in order to feed his tenants.

They next made &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; (1995), a dark, multi-layered fantasy film about a mad scientist who steals children&#x27;s dreams so that he can live indefinitely. The success of &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; led to an invitation to direct the fourth film in the &quot;Alien&quot; series, &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997). This is where Jeunet and Caro ended up going their separate ways, as Jeunet believed this to be an amazing opportunity whereas Caro was not interested in working on a big-budget Hollywood movie on which he would lack creative control. Caro ended up assisting for a few weeks with costumes and set design, but then he decided to start a solo career in illustration and computer graphics.

Jeunet directed &quot;Amélie&quot; (2001), the story of a woman who takes pleasure in doing good deeds but has trouble finding love herself, which starred Audrey Tautou. &quot;Amélie&quot; was a huge critical and commercial success worldwide and was nominated for several Academy Awards. For his work on the film, Jeunet won a European Film Award for Best Director.

In 2004, Jeunet released &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot;, an adaptation of the novel by Sébastien Japrisot. The film, starring Audrey Tautou and Jodie Foster, chronicled a woman&#x27;s search for her missing lover after World War I.

In 2005 Jean-Pierre Jeunet was involved in the creation of a detailed history project about the life of French aviator Louis Blériot. After a year Jeunet felt the movie was too close in historic timeline to &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot; and the project was abandoned.

In 2009, he released &quot;Micmacs&quot;, which is about a man and his friends who come up with an intricate and original plan to destroy two big weapons manufacturers.

Jeunet has also directed numerous commercials, including a 2&#x27;25&quot; film for Chanel N° 5 featuring his frequent collaborator Audrey Tautou.

In 2013, Jeunet released &quot;The Young and Prodigious T.S. Spivet&quot;, an adaptation of Reif Larsen&#x27;s book &quot;The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet&quot; that starred Kyle Catlett.

In 2016, Jeunet and Romain Segaud co-directed the three-minute stop-motion animation film &quot;Deux escargots s&#x27;en vont&quot;, based on a poem by Jacques Prévert.

Since his last release, Jeunet has tried to get other projects funded but has found it impossible to find investors willing to take a risk on his quirky films. He stated in 2019 that he may go to Netflix &quot;as a last resort&quot;, and indeed his next film, &quot;Bigbug&quot;, was released by the streaming video company in 2022.

<text>Concepción (; originally: &quot;Concepción de la Madre Santísima de la Luz&quot;, &quot;Conception of the Blessed Mother of Light&quot;) is a city and commune in south-central Chile, and the geographical and demographic core of the Greater Concepción metropolitan area, one of the three major conurbations in the country. It has a significant impact on domestic trade being part of the most heavily industrialized region in the country. It is the seat of the Concepción Province and the capital of the Bío Bío Region. It sits about 500 km south of the nation&#x27;s capital, Santiago.

The city was first settled in the Bay of Concepción, in the zone that would later become the commune of Penco, now part of the Concepción conurbation. The city&#x27;s demonym, , comes from the place of its original foundation. The city center and historic district is located in the Valle de la Mocha (La Mocha Valley), where it relocated after serious damage left by an earthquake in 1751.

The origin of Concepción dates back to 1550, when it was founded by Pedro de Valdivia as part of the Spanish Empire, under the name of &quot;Concepción de María Purísima del Nuevo Extremo&quot;, and was the capital of the Kingdom of Chile between 1565 and 1573, retaining the unofficial position of military capital for the rest of the colonial period. The city was an important site in the struggle for Chile&#x27;s independence, with the Chilean declaration of Independence being held at Concepción&#x27;s &quot;Plaza de la Independencia&quot;. Until the election of Manuel Montt in 1851 as president, executive power in independent Chile was dominated by Concepción elites.

The city is a known college town in Chile, as it is home to numerous educational institutions, including the University of Concepción, the University of the Bío Bío, and the Catholic University of the Most Holy Conception. The commune also contains various historical bridges, murals, parks and lakes, as well as important cultural venues such as the &quot;Teatro Biobío&quot;, the &quot;Casa del Arte&quot;, the local Natural History Museum, and the &quot;Teatro Universidad de Concepción&quot;.

==History==

Concepción was founded by Don Pedro de Valdivia in 1550 north of the Bío Bío River, at the site which is today known as Penco. At that time it was given the name &quot;Concepción de María Purísima del Nuevo Extremo&quot; (Mary Immaculate Conception of the New End). The new settlement of Concepción was just a few kilometers north of &quot;La Frontera&quot; (The Frontier), the boundary between Spanish territory and the land of the Mapuche, an American Indian ethnic group that remained independent until the 1870s. The settlement was formally recognized by the Spanish authorities as a town two years later by a royal decree. It was given a coat-of-arms that is still in use today.

At the time of the Spanish arrival to the Concepción area chronicler Jerónimo de Vivar noted local Mapuches wore gold and silver bracelets and &quot;sort of crowns&quot;. This is interpreted either as Incan gifts, war spoils from defeated Incas, or the adoption of Incan metallurgy.

Although Concepción was a significant military settlement for the Captaincy General of Chile, it was overrun and destroyed by Mapuche armies in 1554, and once again after being refounded in 1555. Concepción was restored during the governorship of García Hurtado de Mendoza when he landed there and built a fort on the Alto de Pinto in 1557. The town was refounded once more on January 6, 1558, by captain Jerónimo de Villegas. It became the headquarters of the military forces engaged against the Mapuche in La Araucanía over the next two centuries, growing to a population of 10,000 despite a siege in 1564 and other attacks by the Mapuche. Concepción was the home of the Real Audiencia from 1565 to 1575.

Earthquakes and tsunamis, which razed the town in 1570, 1657, 1687, 1730 and 1751, led the authorities to move the town to its current site in the Valle de la Mocha, alongside the Bío Bío River; the old site lay empty until March 29, 1842, when the present town of Penco was founded.

The new site for the town of Concepción became the main town of the Intendancy of Concepción, whose jurisdiction extended from the Maule River to La Frontera. The first Intendant of Concepción was the Irishman Ambrose O&#x27;Higgins, Marquis of Osorno, who later became Royal Governor of Chile and Viceroy of Peru.

When the First National Government Board met in Santiago on September 18, 1810, citizens of Concepción joined up. Concepción was used as the point of entry by the Spanish Army in the attempt by the Viceroyalty of Peru to re-conquer Chile. Concepción politicians and soldiers became a significant political force in the newly independent country.

On January 1, 1818, Ambrose O&#x27;Higgins&#x27;s son, Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, proclaimed and took the oath of the Chilean War of Independence in the main square of Concepción, which since then has been known as &quot;Plaza de la Independencia&quot;. Until the moment of independence, the city had been the scene of various engagements in its old and new settlements.

On February 20, 1835, the town again was largely destroyed by an earthquake and had to be rebuilt.

By 1875, a key British community and German colony existed within the province. By 1895, there was an even larger Spanish presence.

The Universidad de Concepción, founded in 1919, became the first secular private university in Chile. The neighboring harbor of Talcahuano is the site of the largest naval base in Chile.

On February 27, 2010, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Concepción, killing more than 521 people and injuring thousands nationwide. Following the earthquake, geologists relying on global positioning satellite (GPS) data concluded that the city had been displaced roughly to the west as a result of the event. The tsunami that followed missed the city.

After the 2010 Chile earthquake, a prison riot began in Concepción&#x27;s El Manzano prison following a failed escape attempt by the inmates. Different parts of the prison were set on fire and the riot was controlled only after the guards shot into the air and received help from military units. As of March 5, 2010, a Peruvian field hospital has been deployed to the city.

==Seismology==
Like most of the Chilean territory, the Concepción region is seismically active, with much of Concepción destroyed by a violent earthquake in 1939. An earthquake in 1953 damaged 15% of the town&#x27;s buildings. Another major earthquake in 1960 had a nearby epicenter.

On February 27, 2010, an earthquake of 8.8 magnitudes struck at 35.846°S, 72.719°W, NNE of the city. The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake struck at 0334 GMT on Saturday at a depth of . The effects were felt as far away as São Paulo, Brazil—.

==Education==
Concepción is known as &quot;the university city&quot; thanks to the numerous universities within the urban agglomeration, such as the Universidad de Concepción, Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción and Universidad del Biobío. This city also has numerous headquarters for many other universities. In addition, this metropolis has a large educational offer, focused on institutes, centers of technical formation and the universities aforementioned.

===Universities===
The University Pencopolitana whose name was Pontificia Universidad Pencopolitana de La Concepción (Pontifical Pencopolitana University of The Conception) was an old university founded through a decree of the Bishop of Concepción, delivered to the administration of the Society of Jesus which functioned between the years 1724 and 1767. On May 24, 1751, an earthquake followed by a tsunami, ravaged the city causing serious damage, including the destruction of the library of the university and all of its funds. As a product of the fury of the waters, a rich collection of texts of the governance of southern Chile were lost, which resulted in a disaster for the culture and collective memory of the city. Due to the natural disasters, it was decided to relocate the city to the called Valle de la Mocha, location where it is currently situated. Slowly the seminary was revived in the new location, in a period of decline in academic activity in Chilean monastic universities after the creation of the Universidad de San Felipe, yet some degrees continued to be granted before the Suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1767.
The aforementioned University is considered to be the natural and legitimate predecessor of the Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción (UCSC), erected by the Archbishop of Concepción in 1991, from the Talcahuano Regional Headquarters of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.

The image of the Pontifical University of Concepción Pencopolitana, is still valid, for His Majesty King Juan Carlos I of Spain in his 1990 speech on the occasion of his inauguration as Doctor Honoris Causa in the University of Chile, in Santiago de Chile, said: &quot;The work of the Pontifical University Pencopolitana should not be ignored, even before the creation of the University of San Felipe&quot; (Juan Carlos&#x27;s account fails to acknowledge the existence of San Felipe&#x27;s predecessor, the Dominican Universidad de Santo Tomás de Aquino, from the sixteenth century in Santiago).

Meanwhile, the University of Chile allowed schools in the city to teach courses in law which allowed men to obtain a law degree. Among its students was Henry Urrutia Manzano, who decades later became president of the Supreme Court of Chile.

The Universidad de Concepción was created in 1919 by a group of citizens including Enrique Molina Garmendia, its first rector.

Eventually, the university began to receive state support, becoming part of the traditional universities, becoming one of the three most important universities in the country, and the most important at the regional level.

==Transportation==
The city is served by Carriel Sur International Airport in Talcahuano. The metro area&#x27;s public transportation comprises a number of bus lines that run through several avenues and streets of the communes belonging to the agglomeration, as well as the commuter rail system known as Biotrén.

==Climate==
The climate of Concepción is classified as Köppen: &quot;Csb, warm summer mediterranean&quot;, with a dry mild summer. The cool waters of the Pacific Ocean help to maintain mild temperatures throughout the year. Temperatures rarely exceed or fall below . In the six-month period between May and October, the city receives approximately 83% of its total annual precipitation, which totals . The wettest month since records began in 1912 was June 2000 with , whilst all months from November to April have been rainless on occasions.

As might be expected for such a large urban area heavily dependent on wood-burning for heat and diesel for transport, the air in Concepción is third-most polluted in Chile, after Santiago and Temuco.

==Demographics==
According to data collected in 2002 in the Census of the National Institute of Statistics, the township has an area of and a population of 216,061 inhabitants, of whom 103,860 are men and 112,201 are women.

As a commune, Concepcion is home to 14.35% of the total population of the region. 1.88% (4,058 persons) is for the rural population and 98.12% (212,003) for the urban population. Moreover, 5.5% of the country&#x27;s population lives in the Greater Concepción metro area.

Between 1970 and 1982 there is a large increase in the population. One reason is the inclusion of San Pedro, segregated from the municipality of Coronel.

The Concepción commune population sharply declined in 1996 as its territory was divided, creating Chiguayante and San Pedro de la Paz. The number of people living in these communes has grown quickly since they have become bedroom communities of &quot;Concepción&quot;, i.e. residential cities that do not have a center with many shops, as is the case of Concepcion.

There is a significant percentage of foreign residents in the city, the most numerous are the Spanish, Italian and US expatriate communities. There are also smaller segments of German, French, British, Dutch, Greek, Portuguese, Croatian, Scandinavian, Arab and Australian descendants in a city settled by waves of immigration.

==Cultural life==

To an outsider, there may be confusion between the demonyms of the inhabitants of Concepción and the nearby city of Penco. Due to the previous location of Concepción being where Penco currently stands, inhabitants of Concepción are called &quot;penquistas&quot; while inhabitants of Penco are known as &quot;pencones&quot;. Additionally, the unofficial term &quot;pencopolitano&quot; has been coined to refer to locals of any commune belonging to the metropolis or, in a wider definition, to the Concepción province, although the term penquista can technically be used in this case as well.
In 2014, the &quot;Rock en Conce&quot; festival began to take shape. It would be held outdoors, in the city&#x27;s &quot;Parque Bicentenario&quot; (Bicentennial Park), and access to it would be free. The aim of the festival would be to restore the musical spotlight that the city embodied and that earned it the reputation of being the &quot;cradle of Chilean rock&quot; and, at the same time, to establish itself as a major tourist attraction for the city. Its first edition took place on Saturday, March 7, 2015, and since then it has been held with great success every year at the end of each summer, bringing together emerging local bands with major and renowned artists from the national and international scene.
===Music===
Concepción has been described as the &quot;Chilean capital of rock&quot;, since numerous bands of this genre have started their careers in the city, such as Los Tres, Los Bunkers, Emociones Clandestinas, Santos Dumont, De Saloon, Machuca and Julius Popper, among others. Numerous bands have played their first major concerts in the city, such as Los Prisioneros.

The city&#x27;s music venues are a main feature of the tourist route, &quot;La Ruta de la Música&quot;, a project driven by the National Service of Tourism (SERNATUR), where besides the rock scene, the local jazz and folk scenes are also shown.

==Sports==
Concepción was one of the host cities of the official 1959 Basketball World Cup, where Chile won the bronze medal.

Today, Concepción is home to three professional football teams:
* Club Deportivo Universidad de Concepción, currently in the Primera División
* Club Deportivo Ferroviario Almirante Arturo Fernández Vial, currently, in the Chilean second division
* Club de Deportes Concepción, currently in the Chilean third division.

The most notable professional basketball team is:
*C.D. Universidad de Concepción, currently in the Liga Nacional de Básquetbol de Chile.

==Economy==
Historically characterized by a strong manufacturing industry, Concepción has also been a major center for distribution and services and the financial basis of the regional economy.

===Commerce===
Trade in the city is concentrated in the &quot;Plaza Independencia&quot; (Independence Square), the pedestrian street &quot;Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga&quot; (built in 1981), and along the major avenues. One such avenue is the &quot;Diego Barros Arana&quot; street which has developed into the commercial center of the city and the region was until 1907 even known as &quot;calle Comercio&quot; (&quot;Commerce Street&quot;). New commercial centers are being developed around the old central station and the new civic district as a part of the Chilean bicentennial (September 18, 2010). A considerable percentage of local trade is taking place in settlements around the city, in communes such as Hualpén, Talcahuano and San Pedro de la Paz, where there are bustling shopping centers, such as Mall Plaza del Trébol, and where there is a constant commercial development.

Other commercial spots, related to food, are the Vega Monumental and Mercado Central de Concepción (Central Market of Concepción) places offering various services and agricultural and livestock products.

==Administration==
As a commune, Concepción is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2016–2020 mayor was Álvaro Ortiz Vera (Christian Democratic Party), who was first elected in 2012. The communal council has 10 seats, which are currently occupied (2016–2020) by three for Christian Democratic Party, two for National Renewal, two for Independent Democrat Union, one for Communist Party, one for Socialist Party, and one for Radical Party. The following members are:

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Concepción is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Gaston Saavedra (PS), José Miguel Ortiz (PDC), Jaime Toha (PS), Felix Gonzalez (PEV), Enrique Van Rysselberghe (UDI), Sergio Bobadilla (UDI), Francesca Muñoz (RN) and Leonidas Romero (RN), as part of the 21st electoral district (Concepción Province without Lota). The commune is represented in the Senate by Alejandro Navarro Brain (MAS) and Jacqueline Van Rysselberghe (UDI) as part of the 12th senatorial constituency (Biobío-Costa).

<text>VME (&quot;Virtual Machine Environment&quot;) is a mainframe operating system developed by the UK company International Computers Limited (ICL, now part of the Fujitsu group). Originally developed in the 1970s (as VME/B, later VME 2900) to drive ICL&#x27;s then new 2900 Series mainframes, the operating system is now known as OpenVME incorporating a Unix subsystem, and runs on ICL Series 39 and Trimetra mainframe computers, as well as industry-standard x64 servers.

== Origins ==
The development program for the New Range system started on the merger of International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) and English Electric Computers in 1968. One of the fundamental decisions was that it would feature a new operating system. A number of different feasibility and design studies were carried out within ICL, the three most notable being:

* VME/B (originally System B), targeted at large processors such as the 2970/2980 and developed in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire and West Gorton, Manchester
* VME/K (originally System T), targeted at the mid-range systems such as the 2960 and developed at Bracknell after the original design for these small processors, System D, was dropped. VME/K was developed and introduced to the market but was eventually replaced by VME/B
* VME/T, which was never actually launched, but warrants a mention as it was conceived to support &quot;fault tolerance&quot;, and predated the efforts of the successful American startup company Tandem Computers in this area.

The chief architect of VME/B was Brian Warboys, who subsequently became professor of software engineering at the University of Manchester. A number of influences can be seen in its design, for example Multics and ICL&#x27;s earlier George 3 operating system; however it was essentially designed from scratch.

VME/B was viewed as primarily competing with the System/370 IBM mainframe as a commercial operating system, and adopted the EBCDIC character encoding.

==History==

When New Range was first launched in October 1974, its operating system was referred to as &quot;System B&quot;. By the time it was first delivered it had become &quot;VME/B&quot;.

VME/K (originally known internally as &quot;System T&quot; for &quot;Tiny&quot;) was developed independently (according to Campbell-Kelly, &quot;on a whim of Ed Mack&quot;), and was delivered later with the smaller mainframes such as the 2960. At the time VME/B was still plagued with performance and reliability problems, and the mainly American management team had misgivings about it.

There was also a project known as System D, which was an advanced, highly modular operating system designed for configuring and building customized near real-time applications. Although it was used to bid on a system for British Rail it was subsequently cancelled because of engineering resource constraints.

ICL had sold a large system to the European Space Agency to process data from Meteosat at its operation centre in Darmstadt. A bespoke variant of VME/K, known as VME/ESA was developed on-site to meet the customer&#x27;s requirements. 

Following a financial crisis in 1980, new management was brought into ICL: Christophor Laidlaw as Chairman, and Robb Wilmot as Managing Director. An early decision of the new management was to drop VME/K. Thus in July 1981, VME 2900 was launched. Although presented to the customer base as a merger of VME/B and VME/K, it was in reality the VME/B base with a few selected features from VME/K grafted on. This provided the opportunity to drop some obsolescent features, which remained available to customers who needed them in the form of the &quot;BONVME&quot; option.

The &quot;2900&quot; suffix was dropped at System Version 213 (SV213) when ICL launched Series 39 in 1985 as the successor to the original 2900 series, and the &quot;Open&quot; prefix was added after SV294. VME became capable of hosting applications written originally for Unix through a UNIX System V Release 3 based subsystem, called VME/X, adapted to run under VME and using the ASCII character encoding.

In 2007 Fujitsu announced a VME version run as a hosted subsystem, called superNova, within Microsoft Windows, or SUSE or Red Hat Enterprise Linux on x86-64 hardware.

In 2012 the VME user group, AXiS, announced that after almost 40 years it would be disbanding because of the reduced user base.

Fujitsu intended to support VME on customer computers until 2020.

In 2020 Fujitsu transferred 13 HM Revenue and Customs applications from their computers onto Fujitsu&#x27;s virtual managed VME hosting platform.

As of 2021, the Department for Work and Pensions completely replaced its VME based systems, following the completion of its award winning VME-R replacement programme.

==Architecture==
VME is structured as a set of layers, each layer having access to resources at different levels of abstraction. Virtual resources provided by one layer are constructed from the virtual resources offered by the layer below. Access to the resources of each layer is controlled through a set of Access Levels: in order for a process to use a resource at a particular access level, it must have an access key offering access to that level. The concept is similar to the &quot;rings of protection&quot; in Multics. The architecture allows 16 access levels, of which the outer 6 are reserved for user-level code.

Orthogonally to the access levels, the operating system makes resources available to applications in the form of a Virtual Machine (VM). A VM can run multiple processes. In practice, a VM in VME is closer to the concept of a process in other operating systems, while a VME process (or application-created sub-process) is more like a thread in other systems. However, processes running within a VM cannot run concurrently and thus resemble user threads found in other systems. A dedicated instruction is involved in the transfer of control between processes sharing the same VM.

The allocation of resources to a virtual machine uses a stack model: when the stack is popped, all resources allocated at that stack level are released. Calls from an application to the operating system are therefore made by a call that retains the same process stack, but with a change in protection level; the resulting efficiency of system calls is one of the features that makes the architecture competitive.

Communication between Virtual Machines is achieved by means of Events (named communication channels) and shared memory areas. The hardware architecture also provides semaphore instructions INCT (increment-and-test) and TDEC (test-and-decrement).

Files and other persistent objects are recorded in a repository called the Catalogue. The file naming hierarchy is independent of the location of a file on a particular tape or disk volume. In days where there was more need for offline storage, this made it easy to keep track of files regardless of their location, and to move files between locations without renaming them. As well as files, the Catalogue keeps track of users and user groups, volumes, devices, network connections, and many other resources. Metadata for files can be held in an object called a File Description. The Catalogue was probably the first example of what would later be called an entity-relationship database.

Interrupts are handled by creating a new stack frame on the stack for the relevant process, handling the interrupt using this new environment, and then popping the stack to return to the interrupted process.

Run-time exceptions, referred to as &quot;contingencies&quot;, are captured by the Object Program Error Handler (OPEH), which can produce a report (equivalent to a stack trace), either interactively or written to a journal.

===OMF===

Compiled object code is maintained in a format called OMF (Object Module Format), which is both the compiler output and the format used by the loader. Various compilers are available, as well as utilities, notably the Collector, which links the code in several OMF modules into a single module, for more efficient loading at run-time, and the Module Amender, which allows patching of the instructions in an OMF module to fix bugs, using assembly language syntax.

===SCL===
The command language for VME is known as SCL (System Control Language).

This is much more recognizably a typed high-level programming language than the job control or shell languages found in most other operating systems: it can be likened to scripting languages such as JavaScript, though its surface syntax is derived from Algol 68.

SCL is designed to allow both line-at-a-time interactive use from a console or from a command file, and creation of executable scripts or programs (when the language is compiled into object module format in the same way as any other VME programming language). The declaration of a procedure within SCL also acts as the definition of a simple form or template allowing the procedure to be invoked from an interactive terminal, with fields validated according to the data types of the underlying procedure parameters or using the default procedure parameter values.

The built-in command vocabulary uses a consistent naming convention with an imperative verb followed by a noun: for example DELETE_FILE or DISPLAY_LIBRARY_DETAILS. The command can be written in full, or in an abbreviated form that combines standard abbreviations for the verb and noun: for example XF (X for DELETE, F for FILE) or DLBD (D for DISPLAY, LB for LIBRARY, D for DETAILS).

SCL is block-structured, with begin/end blocks serving the dual and complementary roles of defining the lexical scope of variable declarations, and defining the points at which resources acquired from the operating system should be released. Variables in the language (which are accessible from applications in the form of environment variables) can have a number of simple types such as strings, superstrings (sequences of strings), booleans, and integers, and are also used to contain references to system resources such as files and network connections.

It is possible to &quot;disassemble&quot; an SCL program from OMF back into SCL source code using the READ_SCL (or RSCL) command. However the output is not always perfect, and will often include errors that would stop re-compilation without user intervention.

A simple code example can be seen on the 99 bottles of beer website.

A more realistic example, where SCL is used to compile a program written in S3, is shown below. This example is taken from the Columbia University Archive of implementations of Kermit.

Commands illustrated in this fragment include WHENEVER (declares error handling policy), ASSIGN_LIBRARY (binds a local name for a file directory), DELETE_FILE (Makes a permanent file temporary, and it is then deleted at the END of the block), S3_COMPILE (compiles a program written in S3: this command breaks the usual verb-noun convention), NEW_MESSAGE_TEXT_MODULE (creates a module containing parameterized error messages suitable for localization) and COMPILE_SCL, which compiles an SCL program into object code.

The COLLECT command combines different object code modules into a single module, and is driven by its own local command file which is incorporated inline in the SCL between the delimiters &quot;----&quot; and &quot;++++&quot;. The sub-commands INPUT and NEWMODULE identify the names of the input and output modules; SUPPRESS and RETAIN determine the external visibility of named procedures within the collected module; and LISTMODULE requests a report describing the output module.

Note that &quot;.&quot; is used to separate the parts of a hierarchic file name. A leading asterisk denotes a local name for a library, bound using the ASSIGN_LIBRARY command. The number in parentheses after a file name is a generation number. The operating system associates a generation number with every file, and requests for a file get the latest generation unless specified otherwise. Creating a new file will by default create the next generation and leave the previous generation intact; this program however is deliberately choosing to create generation 101, to identify a public release.

===Enhanced security variants===
As a result of ICL&#x27;s heavy involvement with delivery of computer services to the UK Public Sector, in particular those with special security requirements such as OPCON CCIS, it was an early entrant into the market for Secure Systems.

VME formed a core of ICL&#x27;s activities in the Secure Systems arena. It had the advantage that as the last large-scale operating system ever designed, and one built from scratch, its underlying architecture encompassed many of the primitives needed to develop a Secure System, in particular the hardware assisted Access Control Registers (ACR) to limit to privileges that could be taken by any process (including Users).

This led to the UK Government&#x27;s Central Computing and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) funding &quot;Project Spaceman&quot; in the mid 1980s for ICL Defence Technology Centre (DTC) to develop an enhanced security variant of VME. ICL launched this as a pair of complementary products, with the commercial release being called High Security Option (HSO), and the public sector release, including Government Furnished Encryption (GFE) technologies, being called Government Security Option (GSO).

HSO and GSO were formally tested under the CESG UK (Security) Evaluation Scheme, one of the predecessors to ITSEC and Common Criteria, and in doing so became the first mainstream operating system to be formally Certified.

===Unix and open systems interoperability===

ICL had originally announced a hosted Unix facility for VME in 1985, with availability and support for strategic applications to arrive within eighteen months. This facility, supporting SVR1, was reportedly in &quot;field trials&quot; and was to be upgraded to SVR2 prior to a general release in the summer of 1987. Limited availability was then announced to existing VME customers, with others being guided towards ICL&#x27;s Clan range of Unix departmental systems.

In October 1987, ICL made the SV221 release of VME available with support for running SVR2 as a VME Unix System guest. This implementation, described as an &quot;unmarketed&quot; product also known as VNS, informed the design of VME/X, a largely new implementation that was itself released in 1991 and recognised as XPG3 compliant, with XPG4 base 1 compliance following in 1992. ICL&#x27;s OpenVME promotional material noted that VME had been the first non-Unix operating system to gain XPG3 compliance, and the first operating system of any kind to gain XPG4 base compliance.

In 1995, ICL added support for the Internet protocol suite in the form of its UNIX Interworking Option for OpenVME, featuring implementations of TCP/IP, UDP/IP and support for the File Transfer Protocol, Telnet and Network File System (NFS) protocols. The NFS functionality included a server that enabled portions of the OpenVME filestore to be served to NFS clients, and the Telnet functionality allowed users on an OpenVME system to access Unix hosts, also supporting the provision of a login facility on OpenVME for remote users using the protocol. Alongside the Berkeley sockets programming interface, already widely used by Unix applications, the product also offered the X/Open Transport Interface for protocol independence and to support the OSI protocols customarily used by VME software.

===Series 39===
The Series 39 range introduced Nodal Architecture, a novel implementation of distributed shared memory that can be seen as a hybrid of a multiprocessor system and a cluster design. Each machine consists of a number of nodes, and each node contains its own order-code processor (CPU) and main memory. Virtual machines are typically located (at any one time) on one node, but have the capability to run on any node and to be relocated from one node to another. Discs and other peripherals are shared between nodes. Nodes are connected using a high-speed optical bus, which is used to provide applications with a virtual shared memory. Memory segments that are marked as shared (public or global segments) are replicated to each node, with updates being broadcast over the inter-node network. Processes which use unshared memory segments (nodal or local) run in complete isolation from other nodes and processes.
==Development process==
VME was originally written almost entirely in S3, a specially-designed system programming language based on Algol 68R (however, VME/K was written primarily in the SFL assembly language). Although a high-level language is used, the operating system is not designed to be independent of the underlying hardware architecture: on the contrary, the software and hardware architecture are closely integrated.

From the early 1990s onwards, some entirely new VME subsystems were written partly or wholly in the C programming language.

From its earliest days, VME was developed with the aid of a software engineering repository system known as CADES, originally designed and managed by David Pearson (computer scientist) and built for the purpose using an underlying IDMS database. CADES is not merely a version control system for code modules: it manages all aspects of the software lifecycle from requirements capture, design methodology and specification through to field maintenance. 
CADES was used in VME module development to hold separate definitions of data structures (Modes), constants (Literals), procedural interfaces and the core algorithms. Multiple versions (&#x27;Lives&#x27;) of each of these components could exist. The algorithms were written in System Development Language (SDL), which was then converted to S3 source by a pre-processor. Multiple versions of the same modules could be generated.

==Application development tools==
The application development tools offered with VME fall into two categories:
* third-generation programming languages
* fourth-generation QuickBuild toolset.

The toolset on VME is unusually homogeneous, with most customers using the same core set of languages and tools. As a result, the tools are also very well integrated. Third-party tools have made relatively little impression.

For many years the large majority of VME users wrote applications in COBOL, usually making use of the IDMS database and the TPMS transaction processing monitor. Other programming languages included Fortran, Pascal, ALGOL 68RS, Coral 66 and RPG2, but these served minority interests. Later, in the mid 1980s, compilers for C became available, both within and outside the Unix subsystem, largely to enable porting of software such as relational database systems. It is interesting that a PL/I subset compiler was written by the EEC, to assist in porting programs from IBM to ICL hardware.

The compilers developed within ICL share a common architecture, and in some cases share components such as code-generators. Many of the compilers used a module named ALICE [Assembly Language Internal Common Environment] and produced an early form of precompiled code (P-Code) termed ROSE, making compiled Object Module Format (OMF) libraries loadable on any machine in the range. .

===System Programming Languages: S3 and SFL===

The primary language used for developing both the VME operating system itself and other system software such as compilers and transaction processing monitors is S3. This is a high level language based in many ways on Algol 68, but with data types and low-level functions and operators aligned closely with the architecture of the 2900 series.

An assembly language SFL (System Function Language) is also available. This was used for the development of VME/K, whose designers were not confident that a high-level language could give adequate performance, and also for the IDMS database system on account of its origins as a third-party product. SFL was originally called Macro Assembler Programming LanguagE (MAPLE), but as the 2900 architecture was being positioned as consisting of high level language machines the name was changed at the request of ICL Marketing. It had been developed as a part of the toolkit for System D, which was subsequently cancelled. Related families of assemblers for other architectures (CALM-xx running under VME, PALM-xx developed in Pascal and running on various hosts) were developed for internal use.

Neither S3 nor SFL was ever promoted as a commercial development tool for end-user applications, as neither were normally delivered as a standard part of the operating system, nor were they explicitly marketed as products in their own right. Both SFL and S3 were however available as options to user organisations and third parties who had a specific need for them.

===QuickBuild===
The QuickBuild application development environment on VME has been highly successful despite the fact that applications are largely locked into the VME environment. This environment is centred on the Data Dictionary System (DDS, also called OpenDDS), an early and very successful attempt to build a comprehensive repository supporting all the other tools, with full support for the development lifecycle. As well as database schemas and file and record descriptions, the dictionary keeps track of objects such as reports and queries, screen designs, and 4GL code; it also supports a variety of models at the requirements capture level, such as entity-relationship models and process models.

The QuickBuild 4GL is packaged in two forms: 
* ApplicationMaster for the creation of online TP applications
* ReportMaster for batch reporting.

Both are high-level declarative languages, using Jackson Structured Programming as their design paradigm. ApplicationMaster is unusual in its approach to application design in that it focuses on the user session as if it were running in a single conversational process, completely hiding the complexity of maintaining state across user interactions. Because the 4GL and other tools such as the screen designer work only with the DDS dictionary, which also holds the database schemas, there is considerable reuse of metadata that is rarely achieved with other 4GLs.

<text>James Cook University (JCU) is a public university in North Queensland, Australia. The second oldest university in Queensland, JCU is a teaching and research institution. The university&#x27;s main campuses are located in the tropical cities of Cairns and Townsville, and one in the city state of Singapore. JCU also has study centres in Mount Isa, Mackay, Thursday Island and Rockhampton. A Brisbane campus, operated by Russo Higher Education, delivers undergraduate and postgraduate courses to international students. The university&#x27;s main fields of research include environmental sciences, biological sciences, mathematical sciences, earth sciences, agricultural and veterinary sciences, technology and medical and health sciences.

==History==

In 1957, Professor John Douglas Story, vice chancellor of the University of Queensland, proposed a regional university college be established to cater to the people of North Queensland. At that time, the only higher education providers were located in the state capital, Brisbane. On 27 February 1961, the University College of Townsville was opened.

After being proclaimed as an Act of Queensland Parliament, the University College of Townsville became &quot;James Cook University of North Queensland&quot;. The official opening of the university was conducted by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 April 1970.

In 1970 Queen Elizabeth II, The Duke of Edinburgh and Her Royal Highness Princess Anne toured Australia including Queensland. The Queensland tour began on Sunday 12 April when the royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; entered Moreton Bay at Caloundra, sailing into Newstead Wharf. After visiting Brisbane, Longreach and Mount Isa the Royal Family travelled to Mackay. The royal party had a leisurely cruise to Townsville, taking four days to arrive after their departure from Mackay. On the morning of April 20, they were met by The Deputy Mayor of Townsville Mr. T. Aikens, M.L.A. and Mrs Aikens and Mr W.W. Shepherd, Chairman of the Townsville Harbour Board and Mrs Shepherd. The day&#x27;s program began with a Cavalcade of Progress at the Townsville Sports Reserve. The grounds were filled with crowds and children waving Australian flags. It was a spectacle for the royal visitors and the local community who came out on the day.

Following lunch on board &quot;Britannia&quot;, the royal family were driven to the site of Queensland&#x27;s newest university, the James Cook University, Townsville campus. In the presence of many dignitaries, HM Queen Elizabeth II formally granted autonomy to North Queensland&#x27;s new educational institution. In 2020, James Cook University celebrated its 50th anniversary with a Treasures exhibition, showcasing 50 collection items from Special Collections, Eddie Koiki Mabo Library, James Cook University, Townsville.

The rare collection item – &#x27;James Cook University Development: Pimlico to the First Chancellor archival footage, 1960 – 1970&#x27; was one of the Treasures selected for the anniversary year. The 12min film preserved on NQHeritage, the University Library&#x27;s Special Collections online repository, shows footage of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II arriving at the official ceremony and being introduced to the official party. Their Royal Highnesses first appear in the film at 6:06 minutes.

The namesake is British sea captain James Cook, who is best known for being the first European to explore the eastern coast of Australia. A year after JCU&#x27;s proclamation, Cyclone Althea struck the Townsville region. This, together with the destruction caused by Cyclone Tracy in Darwin 1974, prompted the establishment of a cyclone research facility. The Cyclone Testing Station started out as a small project of Professor Hugh Trollope and began its operations on 1 November 1977 as &quot;James Cook Cyclone Structural Testing Station&quot;. Its name was later changed to &quot;The Cyclone Testing Station&quot; in 2002. The Cyclone Testing Station operates as a self funded unit of the College of Science, Technology and Engineering.

On 1 January 1982, JCU amalgamated with The Townsville College of Advanced Education located adjacent to the main campus in Douglas. The university established a campus in Cairns in 1987 which moved to its current location in the suburb of Smithfield in 1995. On 1 January 1991, the School of Art and Design of the Townsville College of TAFE was transferred to JCU. The current name of &quot;James Cook University&quot; became official on 1 January 1998. In 2003 the university opened an international campus in Singapore. The university further expanded its presence by establishing another campus in Brisbane, Queensland in 2006.

JCU Singapore moved campuses in February 2015. The Hon. Tony Abbott MP, Prime Minister of Australia officially opened the new JCU Singapore campus at 149 Sims Drive on 28 June 2015. In 2015, JCU opened the JCU Townsville City campus. In 2017, JCU opened the JCU Cairns, Bada-jali campus in Cairns CBD.

JCU celebrated its 50th anniversary on 20 April 2020. To honour Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples&#x27; continuing contribution to the university, JCU gave Indigenous names to a number of its locations:

* The Townsville (Douglas) campus was named Bebegu Yumba, meaning &#x27;Place of Learning&#x27; in the Birri-Gubba language. 
* The Cairns (Smithfield) campus was named Nguma-bada, meaning &#x27;Place for tomorrow&#x27;s learning, knowledge and wisdom&#x27; from the Yirrgay (Yirrganydji) coastal dialect of Djabugay.
* The Cairns City campus has been named Bada-jali, meaning &#x27;Flowering of the Cocky Apple tree: Place and time for new beginnings and growth&#x27;, from the Yirrgay (Yirrganydji) coastal dialect of Djabugay.
* The Mount Isa campus was named Murtupuni, meaning &#x27;to come together, gather together&#x27; in the Kalkadoon language.
* The Mackay campus was named Ngudya Yamba, meaning &#x27;place of knowledge&#x27; in the Yuwi language.

An Indigenous language name is still to be announced for the JCU Thursday Island campus.

In the early hours of 4 April 2019, a large fire broke out in the A Wing of University Hall requiring the evacuation of over 200 students. There were no serious injuries, although several students were treated for smoke inhalation. Immediately following the fire, the university rushed to find emergency housing for the residents affected. The renovation of the closed Clark Wing at St. Mark&#x27;s College and construction of the new &#x27;The Village&#x27; housing precinct began, and provided replacement housing for all residents from the A and B Wings of University Hall.

==Campuses and buildings==
James Cook University operates three main campuses, located in the tropical cities of Cairns and Townsville in Australia, and the international city of Singapore. JCU&#x27;s Brisbane campus offers courses for international students. The university also operates study centres in Mackay, Mount Isa, Thursday Island and Rockhampton. These study centres provide programs and support for students living in rural and remote areas.

===JCU Cairns, Nguma-bada Campus, Smithfield===
JCU&#x27;s Cairns, Nguma-bada campus is located 15 kilometres north of the Cairns central business district, in the suburb of Smithfield. JCU moved to this location from its original inner-city site in 1995. About 3,000 students study at JCU Cairns, Nguma-bada campus, Smithfield, including 335 international students. Located on the campus grounds are the Australian Tropical Herbarium, JCU Dental and The Cairns Institute.

The JCU Ideas Lab was completed in July, 2020. The $30M eco-friendly building brings together students, staff and community entrepreneurs to progress Internet of Things Engineering and data science. In 2023, the first cohort of Medicine students commenced in Cairns.

A second campus, JCU Cairns, Bada-jali campus, is located in Cairns&#x27; CBD. The campus delivers a diverse range of progressive facilities and services for the university.

===JCU Townsville, Bebegu Yumba Campus, Douglas===
JCU&#x27;s Townsville, Bebegu Yumba campus is the university&#x27;s largest campus and is located on 386 hectares in the suburb of Douglas, near the army base and the lee of Mount Stuart. Originally located in the suburb of Pimlico, the university moved to its current site in 1967. Over 10,000 students study at the JCU Townsville, Bebegu Yumba campus, including over 1,300 international students. Adjacent to the university is the Townsville Hospital.

The Discovery Rise project was announced in September 2007. The $1 billion project, aimed at redeveloping the university&#x27;s Townsville campus, was completed in 2015. The Eddie Koiki Mabo Library (built in 1968 and extended in 1990) has received the 25 Year Architecture Award presented by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects – Queensland Chapter. It also has been recognised as one of Australia&#x27;s ten most iconic buildings alongside structures as the Sydney Opera House and the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

In 2015, the JCU Townsville City campus was opened in Townsville&#x27;s CBD on Flinders Street. The campus delivers a diverse range of progressive facilities and services for the university, business and community organisations.

Construction of the Technology Innovation Complex (TIC) began in March 2021. The 94m, 9,400sqm facility &quot;will be the centrepiece of an innovation hub in which undergraduate and post-graduate engineering and IT students, industry partners and researchers will converge and collaborate&quot;.

TropiQ, Townsville&#x27;s Tropical Intelligence and Health Precinct, is &quot;a community dedicated to helping the world access, understand and benefit from breakthroughs and solutions in health and tropical science&quot;. Located on the Bebegu Yumba campus at JCU Townsville, it was developed in partnership between JCU, Townsville Hospital and Health Service and Townsville City Council.

=== Singapore International Campus ===

James Cook University&#x27;s Singapore campus (JCUS) was opened in 2003. In January 2015, James Cook University Singapore relocated to a new campus at 149 Sims Drive, ceasing operations at its previous campus on Upper Thomson Road, where it had been operating since July 2008. In 2020 there were 3644 students studying with JCU Singapore. Courses offered include business, education, information technology, psychology, environmental science, and tourism and hospitality, to international and domestic students. All degrees awarded are accredited by JCU Australia. Unlike its parent institution in Australia, James Cook University Singapore is classified as a private institution under the Ministry of Education&#x27;s Private Education Act and is accredited by both EduTrust and the Council for Private Education. JCUS was awarded two consecutive &quot;Edutrust Star&quot; ratings by EduTrust in 2015 and 2019, the first private school to attain this benchmark.

There is also a study centre located in the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine (AITHM) building on Thursday Island, providing teaching and learning facilities for nursing, education and diploma of higher education students in the Torres Strait region, including the northern tip of Australia. The Thursday Island study centre opened in 2003.

== Governance and structure ==
=== Coat of arms ===
As a corporate body, James Cook University bears arms comprising four main elements – shield, crest (Captain James Cook&#x27;s ship, &quot;HMS Endeavour&quot;, in full sail), supporters (a pair of brolgas with open wings), and motto.

The university motto is &quot;Cresente Luce&quot;, which means &quot;light ever increasing&quot;. This motto was first proposed by Professor Frederick Walter Robinson (Doc Robbie), professor of English at the University of Queensland, in 1962 for the then University College of Townsville. The university college was established as a college of the University of Queensland. Adopted in 1963, the motto remained unchanged after James Cook University of North Queensland was established and incorporated in April 1970, and later became James Cook University.

==Controversies==

===Peter Ridd sacking===
In November 2017, marine physicist Peter Ridd commenced proceedings in the Federal Circuit Court against the university alleging that by censuring and eventually dismissing him from his employment, JCU had breached the intellectual freedom provision in its enterprise agreement, in violation of the Fair Work Act. Ridd was a long-term professor who had been the head of the physics department from 2009 to 2016, and head of the Marine Geophysical Laboratory at JCU for 15 years. He had been critical of the accuracy of studies by the JCU marine studies centre. JCU maintained that &quot;it had never sought to silence Ridd, and his sacking was due to &#x27;serious misconduct&#x27; and breaches of the university&#x27;s code&quot;.

Following a hearing, the Federal Circuit Court found that the university&#x27;s actions were unlawful, and in September 2019 ordered JCU to pay $1.2 million in compensation to Ridd. The Court found that JCU had failed to respect the rights to intellectual freedom under its enterprise agreement.

In July 2020, a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia overturned the Federal Circuit Court&#x27;s decision, finding that JCU&#x27;s actions did not breach the Fair Work Act and that the enterprise agreement did not give Ridd an &quot;untrammelled right&quot; to express professional opinions beyond the standards imposed by the university&#x27;s code of conduct. In February 2021, the High Court of Australia granted special leave to Ridd to appeal the decision. The High Court heard the matter in June 2021.

On October 13, 2021, the High Court unanimously dismissed the appeal brought by Ridd. Although the Court found that some of the university&#x27;s censures of Ridd were in breach of its enterprise agreement, Ridd ran his case on an &quot;all or nothing&quot; basis, and the High Court found that the termination of his employment was ultimately justified in relying on 18 findings of serious misconduct which were not protected by the university&#x27;s academic freedom clause.

===Sexual harassment and assault===
Nine cases of sexual abuse or harassment were reported officially on campus between 2011 and 2016, resulting in one person being removed from a college. These included an allegation of a 2015 incident in which three unidentified males tried to gang-rape a female student.

In 2015 the university promoted a research officer to academic adviser despite his having pleaded guilty to raping a student. The then acting vice-chancellor said there was a failure of internal processes and that the staff member would have been dismissed immediately if senior management had been aware that he had pleaded guilty. However, whistleblowers said there had been a cover-up and that senior management, including the vice-chancellor and the university secretary, had been told of the guilty plea prior to the perpetrator&#x27;s promotion.

The university began a review in 2017 which led to revised policies, mandatory online training for students and staff, first responder training for staff, and counselling for victims.

===Scientific fraud claims===
In May 2021, the American publication Science Magazine made claims about scientific fraud involving 22 papers linked to James Cook University&#x27;s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. The Australian Research Council, the US National Science Foundation, and JCU had been asked to investigate the allegations. The article supported by the international Science Fund for Investigative Reporting, is the culmination of years of research and contested claims over how fish behaviour is changed by rising levels of carbon dioxide in the oceans. Researchers claimed to have evidence of manipulation in publicly available raw data files for two papers, one published in Science Magazine, the other in &quot;Nature Climate Change&quot;, combined with large and &quot;statistically impossible&quot; effects from reported in many of the other papers.

===Scientific Misconduct===

An investigation by the UK scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; published on 8 January 2020, found that eight James Cook University (JCU) studies on the effect of climate change on coral reef fish, one of which was authored by a JCU educated discredited scientist, had a 100 percent replication failure and thus none of the findings of the original eight studies were found to be correct. The Swedish scientists Josefin Sundin and Fredrik Jutfelt were the first to report their suspicions to Uppsala University. Their informal investigation, and the proofs they collected, lead to the formal investigation. Concerns raised about a study the scientist published while at JCU between 2010 and 2014 included an improbable number of lionfish claimed to have been used in this study, and images of 50 fish provided which appeared to include multiple images of some biological specimens, and two images that had been flipped making two fish appear to be four. The scientist had also been found guilty of fabricating data underpinning a study at Uppsala University in Sweden following her departure from JCU in Queensland, Australia. The study was subsequently retracted.

<text>Folke Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg (2 January 1895 – 17 September 1948) was a Swedish nobleman and diplomat. In World War II, he negotiated the release of about 450 Danish Jews and 30,550 non-Jewish prisoners of many nations from the Nazi German Theresienstadt concentration camp. They were released on 14 April 1945. In 1945 he received a German surrender offer from Heinrich Himmler, though the offer was ultimately rejected by the allies.

After the war, Bernadotte was unanimously chosen to be the United Nations Security Council mediator in the Arab–Israeli conflict of 1947–1948. He was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1948 by the paramilitary Zionist group Lehi while pursuing his official duties. Upon his death, Ralph Bunche took up his work at the UN, successfully mediating the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Egypt.

==Early life==
Folke Bernadotte was born in Stockholm into the House of Bernadotte, the Swedish royal family. His father, Prince Oscar Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg (formerly Prince Oscar of Sweden, Duke of Gotland), was the second son of King Oscar II of Sweden; his mother, Ebba Munck af Fulkila, had been a lady in waiting to Victoria of Baden, the wife of Crown Prince Gustaf. Oscar had married Ebba without the consent of the King, and so was forced to renounce his Swedish titles; in 1892, he was granted the titles of Prince Bernadotte and Count of Wisborg by his uncle, Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg.

Bernadotte attended school in Stockholm, after which he entered training to become a cavalry officer at the Royal Military Academy. He took the officer&#x27;s exam in 1915, was commissioned a lieutenant in 1918, and subsequently was promoted to the rank of major.

Bernadotte represented Sweden in 1933 at the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition, and later served as Swedish commissioner general at the New York World&#x27;s Fair in 1939–40. Bernadotte had long been involved with the Swedish Boy Scouts (Sveriges Scoutförbund), and took over as director of the organization in 1937. At the outbreak of World War II, Bernadotte worked to integrate the scouts into Sweden&#x27;s defense plan, training them in anti-aircraft work and as medical assistants. Bernadotte was appointed Vice Chairman of the Swedish Red Cross in 1943.

==Diplomatic career==
===World War II===

During the autumns of 1943 and 1944, he organized prisoner exchanges which brought home 11,000 prisoners from Germany via Sweden. While Vice-President of the Swedish Red Cross in 1945, Bernadotte attempted to negotiate an armistice between Germany and the Allies. He also led several rescue missions in Germany for the Red Cross. In April 1945, Heinrich Himmler asked Bernadotte to convey a peace proposal to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Harry S. Truman without the knowledge of Adolf Hitler. The main point of the proposal was that Germany would surrender only to the Western Allies (the United Kingdom and the United States), but would be allowed to continue resisting the Soviet Union. According to Bernadotte, he told Himmler that the proposal had no chance of acceptance, but nevertheless he passed it on to the Swedish government and the Western Allies. It had no lasting effect.

===White Buses===
Upon the initiative of the Norwegian diplomat Niels Christian Ditleff in the final months of the war, Bernadotte acted as the negotiator for a rescue operation transporting interned Norwegians, Danes and other western European inmates from German concentration camps to hospitals in Sweden.

In the spring of 1945, Bernadotte was in Germany when he met Heinrich Himmler, who was briefly appointed commander of an entire German army following the assassination attempt on Hitler the year before. Bernadotte had originally been assigned to retrieve Norwegian and Danish POWs in Germany. He returned on 1 May 1945, the day after Hitler&#x27;s death. Following an interview, the Swedish newspaper &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; wrote that Bernadotte succeeded in rescuing 15,000 people from German concentration camps, including about 8,000 Danes and Norwegians and 7,000 women of French, Polish, Czech, British, American, Argentinian, and Chinese nationalities. The missions took around two months, and exposed the Swedish Red Cross staff to significant danger, both due to political difficulties and by taking them through areas under Allied bombing.

The mission became known for its buses, painted entirely white except for the Red Cross emblem on the side, so that they would not be mistaken for military targets. In total it included 308 personnel (about 20 medics and the rest volunteer soldiers), 36 hospital buses, 19 trucks, seven passenger cars, seven motorcycles, a tow truck, a field kitchen, and full supplies for the entire trip, including food and gasoline, none of which was permitted to be obtained in Germany. A count of 21,000 people rescued included 8,000 Danes and Norwegians, 5,911 Poles, 2,629 French, 1,615 Jews, and 1,124 Germans.

After Germany&#x27;s surrender, the White Buses mission continued in May and June and about 10,000 additional liberated prisoners were thus evacuated.

Bernadotte recounted the White Buses mission in his book &quot;The End. My Humanitarian Negotiations in Germany in 1945 and Their Political Consequences&quot;, published on June 15, 1945 in Swedish.

====Postwar controversy====
Following the war, some controversies arose regarding Bernadotte&#x27;s leadership of the White Buses expedition, some personal and some as to the mission itself. One aspect involved a long-standing feud between Bernadotte and Himmler&#x27;s personal masseur, Felix Kersten, who had played a role in facilitating Bernadotte&#x27;s access to Himmler, but whom Bernadotte resisted crediting after the war. The resulting feud between Bernadotte and Kersten came to public attention through British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper. In 1953, Trevor-Roper published an article based on an interview and documents originating with Kersten. The article stated that Bernadotte&#x27;s role in the rescue operations was that of &quot;transport officer, no more&quot;. Kersten was quoted as saying that, according to Himmler, Bernadotte was opposed to the rescue of Jews and understood &quot;the necessity of our fight against World Jewry&quot;.

Shortly following the publication of his article, Trevor-Roper began to retreat from these charges. At the time of his article, Kersten had just been nominated by the Dutch government for the Nobel Peace Prize for thwarting a Nazi plan to deport the entire Dutch population, based primarily on Kersten&#x27;s own claims to this effect. A later investigation by Dutch historian Louis de Jong concluded that no such plan had existed, however, and that Kersten&#x27;s documents were partly fabricated. Following these revelations and others, Trevor-Roper told journalist Barbara Amiel in 1995 that he was no longer certain about the allegations, and that Bernadotte may merely have been following his orders to rescue Danish and Norwegian prisoners. Several other historians have also questioned Kersten&#x27;s account, concluding that the accusations were based on a forgery or a distortion devised by Kersten.

Some controversy regarding the White Buses trip has also arisen in Scandinavia, particularly regarding the priority given to Scandinavian prisoners. Political scientist Sune Persson judged these doubts to be contradicted by the documentary evidence. He concluded, &quot;The accusations against Count Bernadotte ... to the effect that he refused to save Jews from the concentration camps are obvious lies&quot; and listed many prominent eyewitnesses who testified on Bernadotte&#x27;s behalf, including the World Jewish Congress representative in Stockholm in 1945.

===UN mediator===

On 20 May 1948, Folke Bernadotte was appointed &quot;United Nations Mediator in Palestine&quot;, in accordance with UN-resolution 186 of 14 May 1948.
It was the first official mediation in the UN&#x27;s history. This was necessitated by the immediate violence that followed the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the subsequent unilateral Israeli Declaration of Independence. In this capacity, he succeeded in achieving an initial truce during the subsequent 1948 Arab–Israeli War and laid the groundwork for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The specific proposals showed the influence of the previously responsible British government, and to a lesser extent the U.S. government.
Bernadotte wrote that: &quot;in putting forward any proposal for the solution of the Palestine problem, one must bear in mind the aspirations of the Jews, the political difficulties and differences of opinion of the Arab leaders, the strategic interests of Great Britain, the financial commitment of the United States and the Soviet Union, the outcome of the war, and finally the authority and prestige of the United Nations.&quot;

After Bernadotte&#x27;s assassination, his assistant American mediator Ralph Bunche was appointed to replace him. Bunche eventually negotiated a ceasefire, signed on the Greek island of Rhodes. See 1949 Armistice Agreements.

==Assassination==
Bernadotte was assassinated on Friday 17 September 1948 by members of the group Lehi, a Zionist paramilitary militant organization, commonly known in the West as the Stern Gang. Immediately after Bernadotte was pronounced dead, his body was moved to the YMCA, after which it was taken to Haifa and flown back to Sweden. Bernadotte was granted a state funeral, Abba Eban attended on behalf of Israel. Bernadotte was survived by a widow and two sons, a 12-year-old and a 17-year-old. He was buried in Prince Oscar Bernadotte&#x27;s family tomb at the Northern Cemetery in Stockholm.

===Planning and background===
Journalist Baruch Nadel planned the murder. The Stern Gang saw Bernadotte as a puppet of the British and the Arabs and therefore a serious threat to the emerging State of Israel. Most immediately, a truce was in force, and Lehi feared that the Israeli leadership would agree to Bernadotte&#x27;s peace proposals, which it considered disastrous. The group was unaware the Israeli government had already decided to reject Bernadotte&#x27;s plan and to take the military option.

The killing was approved by the three-man &#x27;center&#x27; of Lehi: Yitzhak Yezernitsky (the future Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Shamir), Nathan Friedmann (also called Natan Yellin-Mor) and Yisrael Eldad (also known as Scheib). A fourth leader, Emmanuel Strassberg (Hanegbi) was also suspected by the Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion of being part of the group that ordered the assassination.
The assassination was planned by Lehi&#x27;s Jerusalem operations chief, Yehoshua Zettler.

===The attack===

A four-man team, consisting of Yehoshua Cohen, Yitzhak Ben-Moshe (Markovitz), Avraham Steinberg, and Meshulam Makover, ambushed Bernadotte&#x27;s motorcade in Jerusalem&#x27;s Katamon neighborhood. The team left a Lehi base in a Jeep and set up a makeshift roadblock at Ben Zion Guini Square, off Hapalmach Street, and waited in the jeep. When Bernadotte&#x27;s motorcade approached, Cohen, Ben-Moshe, and Steinberg got out and approached it, while Makover, the driver, remained in the jeep. Captain Moshe Hillman, the motorcade&#x27;s Israeli liaison officer, who was sitting in the leading UN vehicle, called out in Hebrew to let them through, but was ignored.

Cohen came up to Bernadotte&#x27;s sedan and fired through an open window, pumping 6 shots into Bernadotte&#x27;s chest, throat and arms and 18 into Colonel André Serot who was seated to his left, killing both. Serot had swapped places in the motorcade to join Bernadotte and thank him personally for having saved his wife&#x27;s life in a German concentration camp. Ben-Moshe and Steinberg shot at the tires of the UN vehicles, while Cohen finished the magazine by firing at the radiator. The driver of the sedan, Colonel Begley, got out and tried to grapple with Cohen as he fired his last shots, but was burned in the face by the gun flashes. Ben-Moshe and Steinberg then rushed back and mounted the jeep, which quickly accelerated down a side road, while Cohen ran away from the scene across a roadside field.

Following the shooting, Bernadotte&#x27;s car sped to Hadassah Mount Scopus Hospital, despite damage to the radiator; the lead vehicle followed as its tires came apart. At the hospital, Bernadotte was pronounced dead.

All four members of the hit team made it to the religious community of Shaarei Pina, where they hid with local Haredi sympathizers. After a few days in hiding, they fled to Tel Aviv in the back of a furniture truck.

===Investigation===
Lehi leaders initially denied responsibility for the attack. Only later did Lehi take responsibility for the killings in the name of &quot;Hazit Hamoledet&quot; (the Homeland Front), a name they copied from a war-time Bulgarian resistance group.

Lehi was forcibly disarmed and many members were arrested, but nobody was charged with the killings. The Israel Police, along with the military police and security services, investigated the assassination, but failed to identify any of the participants in the assassination, and the case was eventually closed without any of the participants having been identified. It has been suggested that the reasons for the failure of the investigation were poor coordination between these bodies, which resulted in information that may have assisted the police not being turned over to them, and the lack of proficiency among police officers and investigators in the early days of the Israel Police. The murder case was identified as &quot;148/48&quot; in Israeli police records.
Yellin-Mor and another Lehi member, Mattityahu Shmulevitz, were charged with belonging to a terrorist organization. They were found guilty but immediately released and pardoned. Yellin-Mor had meanwhile been elected to the first Knesset. Betty Knut-Lazarus, a Lehi militant, and the granddaughter of composer Alexander Scriabin, was also imprisoned for being allegedly involved in the killing, before being subsequently released.

Years later, Cohen&#x27;s role was uncovered by David Ben-Gurion&#x27;s biographer Michael Bar Zohar, while Cohen was working as Ben-Gurion&#x27;s personal bodyguard. The first public admission of Lehi&#x27;s role in the killing was made on the anniversary of the assassination in 1977. The statute of limitations for the murder had expired in 1971. In 1988, two years after Cohen&#x27;s death, Zettler and Makover publicly confessed their role in the assassination and confirmed that Cohen had killed Bernadotte.

The weapon which was used in the assassination (an MP 40, serial number 2581) was lost, and was only found again in 2018 during an inventory check in the , when an unidentified box was found to contain an MP 40 machine pistol and the curator, Shlomi Shitrit, decided to identify the history of the weapon. Prior to finding it, it was believed to have been destroyed.

===Diplomatic fallout===
The day after the murders, by means of Security Council Resolution 57, the United Nations Security Council condemned the killing of Bernadotte as &quot;a cowardly act which appears to have been committed by a criminal group of terrorists in Jerusalem while the United Nations representative was fulfilling his peace-seeking mission in the Holy Land.&quot;

The Swedish government believed that Bernadotte had been assassinated by Israeli government agents. They publicly attacked the inadequacy of the Israeli investigation, and campaigned unsuccessfully to delay Israel&#x27;s admission to the United Nations. In 1950, Sweden recognized Israel, but relations remained frosty despite Israeli attempts to mollify Sweden, such as through the planting of a Bernadotte Forest by the Jewish National Fund in Israel. At a ceremony in Tel Aviv in May 1995, attended by the Swedish deputy prime minister, Israeli Foreign Minister and Labor Party member Shimon Peres issued a &quot;condemnation of terror, thanks for the rescue of the Jews and regret that Bernadotte was murdered in a terrorist way&quot;, adding that &quot;We hope this ceremony will help in healing the wound.&quot;

Ralph Bunche, Bernadotte&#x27;s American deputy, succeeded him as U.N. mediator. Bunche was successful in bringing about the signing of the 1949 Armistice Agreements, for which he received the Nobel Peace Prize.

===Awards and memorials===
In 1998, Bernadotte was posthumously awarded one of the first three Dag Hammarskjöld Medals, given to UN peacekeepers who are killed in the line of duty.
The university library at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, US is named after him.

The Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem features one of the &quot;white buses&quot; of Bernadotte&#x27;s mission to Nazi Germany, which it recognises as rescuing 25,000 prisoners including several thousand Jews.

Bernadotte rescued large number of Jews and others, Yad Vashem did not award him the &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot; title. His name does not appear in that database&#x27;s Sweden section.

==Wife and children==
In 1928 in Pleasantville, New York, Folke Bernadotte married Estelle Romaine Manville (1904–1984), whose family had founded part of the Johns-Manville Corporation.
They had four sons, two of whom died in childhood.
*Count Gustaf Eduard Bernadotte of Wisborg (1930–1936)
*Count Folke Bernadotte of Wisborg (born 1931), married Christine Glahns
*Count Fredrik Oscar Bernadotte of Wisborg (1934–1944)
*Count Bertil Oscar Bernadotte of Wisborg (born 1935) married Rose-Marie Heering (1942–1967) and Jill Georgina Rhodes-Maddox

Seven grandchildren were all born after Folke Bernadotte&#x27;s death. His widow Estelle Bernadotte remarried in 1973.

In September 2008, it became official that before his marriage Bernadotte had a daughter with actress (1892–1981):
*Jeanne Birgitta Sofia Kristina Matthiessen, née Ericson (1921–1991), who was adopted by Carl G. W. Matthiessen (1886–1951) when he married Lillie Ericson in 1925.

<text>Aprilia is an Italian motorcycle and scooter manufacturer in Noale, Italy, by Alberto Beggio.

==History==
=== Early days ===
Aprilia, named after the pre-war Lancia Aprilia, was founded after World War II by Cavaliere Alberto Beggio as a bicycle production factory . 

=== Motorcycles ===
Alberto&#x27;s son, Ivano Beggio, took over the helm of the company in 1968 and constructed a 50 cc &quot;motorcycle&quot;. 

The first production Aprilia mopeds were named &quot;Colibrì&quot;, &quot;Daniela&quot;, and &quot;Packi&quot;. 

In the 1980s, Aprilia added enduro, trials and road bikes of between 50 and 600 cc. 

In 1981, Aprilia introduced the TL320 trials machine. 

In 1983, Aprilia launched the St 125 road bike. 

In 1984, they launched an improved model called STX, as well as an enduro, called the ET 50.

In 1985, Aprilia started outsourcing engines for some models to the Austrian company Rotax. 

In 1985 Aprilia launched a 125 STX and 350 STX. 

In 1990, Aprilia launched the Pegaso 600, a road bike derived from off-road mechanics. 

=== Scooters ===
In the 1990s, Aprilia entered the scooter market starting in 1990 with Italy&#x27;s first all-plastic scooter, the Amico. 

In 1992, Aprilia introduced the Amico LK and the two stroke Pegaso 125, both with catalytic converters. 

In 1993, Aprilia launched a large diameter wheel scooter reusing the name Scarabeo with a four-stroke, four-valve engine. 

Later, Aprilia launched more scooters such as the Leonardo, the SR and the Gulliver.

In 1995, Aprilia commissioned Philippe Starck to design the Motò which was shown in New York&#x27;s Modern Art Museum. 

Also in 1995, Aprilia launched the two stroke RS 125 and RS 250 sports bikes. 

In 1998, Aprilia launched the RSV Mille, a 1000cc V-Twin Superbike, and the Falco, a 1000cc V-Twin sport tourer with emphasis on sport. Both bikes used a variation of a Rotax 1000cc engine.

In 2000, Aprilia launched the 50 cc DiTech (Direct Injection Technology) two stroke engine for scooters which provides high mileage and low emissions, and also the RST Futura, a sport tourer, and the ETV 1000 Caponord; an adventure touring motorcycle. 

Both of these latter two motorcycles used a variation of the Rotax 1000 cc V-Twin.

Most recently, in 2003, Aprilia launched the RSV Mille Tuono which was essentially an RSV Mille with motocross-style high handlebars and only a small headlight fairing. Most of the major motorcycle magazines picked it for the best bike of the year. 

=== Sportbikes ===
Aprilia produced a motocross bike in 50 and 125 cc versions in the 1970s called the Scarabeo. 

Since in the 1980s, Aprilia has also produced large sportbikes such as the 1,000 cc V-twin RSV Mille and the V4 RSV4.

In 1986, Aprilia launched the AF1, a small sports model; and the Tuareg, a large tanked bike for African rallies like the Dakar Rally. 

== Operation ==

=== Acquisition ===
During 2000, Aprilia acquired Moto-Guzzi and Laverda, both historic heritage Italian marques. 

=== Ownership ===
In 2004, Aprilia was acquired by Piaggio &amp; C. SpA, to form the world&#x27;s fourth largest motorcycle group with 1.5 billion Euro in sales, an annual production capacity of over 600,000 vehicles, and a presence in 50 countries.

With the acquisition by Piaggio, the new President of Aprilia is Roberto Colaninno (President of Piaggio &amp; C.), and the managing director is Rocco Sabelli. The son of the founder, Ivano Beggio, was the Honorary President and died on 13 March 2018. 

==Racing==
Despite being a relatively small company by global motorcycling standards, Aprilia is very active in motorcycle sports. 

Aprilia has contested many road racing formulae, including the now-defunct 125 cc, 250 cc and 500 cc Grand Prix classes of FIM World Championships. 

Aprilia have also been in and out of the MotoGP and Superbike World Championship - as a factory team and a constructor, having partnered with Gresini Racing (from 2015 to 2021) and Trackhouse Racing (since 2024) - alongside other commitments.

<doc id="75758" wikidata="Q312870" url="?curid=75758" title="Jerry Garcia">
<text>Jerome John Garcia (August 1, 1942 – August 9, 1995) was an American musician who was the lead guitarist, and a vocalist with the rock band Grateful Dead, which he co-founded and which came to prominence during the counterculture of the 1960s. Although he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader of the band. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 as a member of the Grateful Dead.

As one of its founders, Garcia performed with the Grateful Dead for the band&#x27;s entire 30-year career (1965–1995). Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders–Garcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), the Jerry Garcia Band, Old &amp; In the Way, the Garcia/Grisman and Garcia/Kahn acoustic duos, Legion of Mary, and New Riders of the Purple Sage (which he co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson). He also released several solo albums, and contributed to a number of albums by other artists over the years as a session musician. He was well known for his distinctive guitar playing, and was ranked 13th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; cover story in 2003. In the 2015 version of the list he was ranked at #46. In 2023, Garcia was ranked 34th by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Garcia was renowned for his musical and technical ability, particularly his ability to play a variety of instruments and sustain long improvisations. Garcia believed that improvisation took stress away from his playing and allowed him to make spur of the moment decisions that he would not have made intentionally. In a 1993 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Garcia noted that &quot;my own preferences are for improvisation, for making it up as I go along. The idea of , of eliminating possibilities by deciding, that&#x27;s difficult for me&quot;. Originating from the days of the &quot;Acid Tests&quot;, these improvisations were a form of exploration rather than playing a song already written.

Later in life, Garcia struggled with diabetes. In 1986, he went into a diabetic coma and nearly died. Although his overall health improved somewhat after the incident, he continued to struggle with obesity, smoking, and long-standing heroin and cocaine addictions. He was staying in a California drug rehabilitation facility when he died of a heart attack in August 1995, just eight days after his 53rd birthday.

==Early life==
Garcia&#x27;s ancestors on his father&#x27;s side were from Galicia in northwest Spain. His mother&#x27;s ancestors were Irish and Swedish. He was born in the Excelsior District of San Francisco, California, on August 1, 1942, to Jose Ramon &quot;Joe&quot; Garcia and Ruth Marie &quot;Bobbie&quot; (née Clifford) Garcia, who was herself born in San Francisco. His parents named him after composer Jerome Kern. Jerome John was their second child, preceded by Clifford Ramon &quot;Tiff&quot;, who was born in 1937. Shortly before Clifford&#x27;s birth, their father and a partner leased a building in downtown San Francisco and turned it into a bar, partly in response to Jose being blackballed from a musicians&#x27; union for moonlighting.

Garcia was raised as a Catholic. He was influenced by music at an early age, taking piano lessons for much of his childhood. His father was a retired professional musician and his mother enjoyed playing the piano. His father&#x27;s extended family—which had immigrated from Spain in 1919—would often sing during reunions.

In 1946, two-thirds of four-year-old Garcia&#x27;s right middle finger was cut off by his brother in a wood splitting accident, while the family was vacationing in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Garcia later confessed that he often used it to his advantage in his youth, showing it off to other children in his neighborhood.

Less than a year after this incident his father died in a fly fishing accident when the family was vacationing near Arcata in Northern California. He slipped after entering the Trinity River, part of the Six Rivers National Forest, and drowned before other fishermen could reach him. Although Garcia claimed he saw the incident, Dennis McNally, author of the book &quot;A Long Strange Trip: The Inside Story of the Grateful Dead&quot;, argues Garcia formed the memory after hearing others repeat the story. Blair Jackson, who wrote &quot;Garcia: An American Life&quot;, notes that a local newspaper article describing Jose&#x27;s death did not mention Jerry being present when he died.

===Excelsior District===
Following his father&#x27;s death, Garcia&#x27;s mother Ruth took over her husband&#x27;s bar, buying out his partner for full ownership. She began working full-time there, sending Jerry and his brother to live nearby with her parents, Tillie and William Clifford. During the five-year period in which he lived with his grandparents, Garcia enjoyed autonomy and he attended Monroe Elementary School. At the school, Garcia was greatly encouraged in his artistic abilities by his third grade teacher: through her, he discovered that &quot;being a creative person was a viable possibility in life.&quot; According to Garcia, it was around this time that he was opened up to country and bluegrass music by his grandmother, whom he recalled enjoyed listening to the Grand Ole Opry. His elder brother, Clifford, however, staunchly believed the contrary, insisting that Garcia was &quot;fantasizing all [that] ... she&#x27;d been to Opry, but she didn&#x27;t listen to it on the radio.&quot; It was at this point that Garcia started playing the banjo, his first stringed instrument.

===Menlo Park===
In 1953, Garcia&#x27;s mother married Wally Matusiewicz. Subsequently, Garcia and his brother moved back home with their mother and new stepfather. However, due to the roughneck reputation of their neighborhood at the time, Garcia&#x27;s mother moved their family to Menlo Park. During their stay in Menlo Park, Garcia became acquainted with racism and antisemitism, things he disliked intensely. The same year, Garcia was also introduced to rock and roll and rhythm and blues by his brother, and enjoyed listening to Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, B. B. King, Hank Ballard, and, later, Chuck Berry. Clifford often memorized the vocals for his favorite songs, and would then make Garcia learn the harmony parts, a move to which Garcia later attributed much of his early ear training.

In mid-1957, Garcia began smoking cigarettes and was introduced to marijuana. Garcia would later reminisce about the first time he smoked marijuana: &quot;Me and a friend of mine went up into the hills with two joints, the San Francisco foothills, and smoked these joints and just got so high and laughed and roared and went skipping down the streets doing funny things and just having a helluva time&quot;. During this time, Garcia also studied at what is now the San Francisco Art Institute. At San Francisco Art Institute, Garcia was taught by Wally Hedrick, an artist who came to prominence during the 1960s. During the classes, he often encouraged Garcia to draw and paint, noting that Garcia had skill in both areas. Hedrick also introduced Garcia to the fiction of Jack Kerouac, whom Garcia later cited as a major influence.

===San Francisco===
In June, Garcia graduated from the local Menlo Oaks school. He then moved with his family back to San Francisco, where they lived in an apartment above the family bar, a newly built replacement for the original, which had been torn down to make way for a freeway entrance. Two months later, on Garcia&#x27;s fifteenth birthday, his mother bought an accordion for him, to his great disappointment. Garcia had long been captivated by many rhythm and blues artists, especially Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, leaving him craving an electric guitar. After some pleading, his mother exchanged the accordion for a Danelectro with a small amplifier at a local pawnshop. Garcia&#x27;s stepfather, who was somewhat proficient with instruments, helped tune his guitar to an unusual open tuning.

===Cazadero===
After a short stint at Denman Junior High School, Garcia attended tenth grade at Balboa High School in 1958, where he often got into trouble for skipping classes and fighting. Consequently, in 1959, Garcia&#x27;s mother again moved the family to a safer environment, to Cazadero, a small town in Sonoma County, north of San Francisco. This turn of events did not sit well with Garcia, who had to travel by bus to Analy High School in Sebastopol, the nearest school. Garcia did, however, join a band at his school known as the Chords. After performing in and winning a contest, the band&#x27;s reward was recording a song. They chose &quot;Raunchy&quot; by Bill Justis.

==Recording career==
===Relocation and band beginnings===
Garcia stole his mother&#x27;s car in 1960 and was given the option of joining the U.S. Army in lieu of prison. He received basic training at Fort Ord. After training, he was transferred to Fort Winfield Scott in the Presidio of San Francisco. Garcia spent most of his time in the army at his leisure, missing roll call and accruing many counts of being AWOL. As a result, Garcia was given a general discharge on December 14, 1960.

In January 1961, Garcia drove to East Palo Alto to see Laird Grant, an old friend from middle school. He had purchased a 1950 Cadillac sedan from a cook in the army, which barely made it to Grant&#x27;s residence before it broke down. Garcia spent the next few weeks sleeping where friends would allow, eventually using his car as a home. Through Grant, Garcia met Dave McQueen in February, who, after hearing Garcia perform some blues music, introduced him to local people and to the Chateau, a rooming house located near Stanford University which was then a popular hangout.

On February 20, 1961, Garcia got into a car with Paul Speegle, a sixteen-year-old artist and acquaintance of Garcia; Lee Adams, the house manager of the Chateau and driver of the car; and Alan Trist, a companion of theirs. After speeding past the Palo Alto Veterans Hospital, the driver encountered a curve and, speeding around , crashed into the guard rail, sending the car rolling turbulently. Garcia was hurled through the windshield of the car into a nearby field with such force that he was literally dislodged from his shoes and later unable to recall the ejection. Lee Adams, the driver, and Alan Trist, who was seated in the back, were thrown from the car as well, resulting in abdominal injuries and a spine fracture, respectively. Garcia escaped with a broken collarbone, while Speegle, still in the car, was fatally injured.

Lee&#x27;s reckless driving and crash served as an awakening for Garcia, who later said, &quot;That&#x27;s where my life began. Before then I was always living at less than capacity. I was idling. That was the slingshot for the rest of my life. It was like a second chance. Then I got serious&quot;. It was at this time that Garcia began to realize that he needed to begin playing the guitar in earnest—a move which meant giving up his love of drawing and painting.

In April 1961, Garcia first met Robert Hunter, who would become a long-time friend of and lyricist for the Grateful Dead, collaborating principally with Garcia. The two involved themselves in the South Bay and San Francisco art and music scenes, sometimes playing at Menlo Park&#x27;s Kepler&#x27;s Books. Garcia performed his first concert with Hunter, each earning five dollars. Garcia and Hunter also played in bands (the Wildwood Boys and the Hart Valley Drifters) with David Nelson, who would later play with Garcia in the New Riders of the Purple Sage and contribute to several Grateful Dead album songs.

In 1962, Garcia met Phil Lesh, the eventual bassist of the Grateful Dead, during a party in Menlo Park&#x27;s bohemian Perry Lane neighborhood (where author Ken Kesey lived). Lesh would later write in his autobiography that Garcia reminded him of pictures he had seen of the composer Claude Debussy, with his &quot;dark, curly hair, goatee, Impressionist eyes&quot;. While attending another party in Palo Alto, Lesh approached Garcia to suggest they record Garcia on Lesh&#x27;s tape recorder and produce a radio show for the progressive, community-supported Berkeley radio station KPFA. Using an old Wollensak tape recorder, they recorded &quot;Matty Groves&quot; and &quot;The Long Black Veil&quot;, among several other tunes. The recordings became a central feature of a 90-minute KPFA special broadcast, &quot;The Long Black Veil and Other Ballads: An Evening with Jerry Garcia&quot;. The link between KPFA and the Grateful Dead continues to this day, having included many fundraisers, interviews, live concert broadcasts, taped band performances and all-day or all-weekend &quot;Dead-only&quot; marathons.

Garcia soon began playing and teaching acoustic guitar and banjo. One of Garcia&#x27;s students was Bob Matthews, who later engineered many of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s albums. Matthews attended Menlo-Atherton High School and was friends with Bob Weir, and on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1963, he introduced Weir and Garcia.

Between 1962 and 1964, Garcia sang and performed mainly bluegrass, old-time, and folk music. One of the bands Garcia performed with was the Sleepy Hollow Hog Stompers, a bluegrass act. The group consisted of Garcia on guitar, banjo, vocals, and harmonica, Marshall Leicester on banjo, guitar, and vocals, and Dick Arnold on fiddle and vocals. Soon after this, Garcia, Weir, Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan, and several of their friends formed a jug band called Mother McCree&#x27;s Uptown Jug Champions. Around this time, the psychedelic drug LSD was gaining popularity. Garcia first began using LSD in 1964; later, when asked how it changed his life, he remarked: &quot;Well, it changed everything [...] the effect was that it freed me because I suddenly realized that my little attempt at having a straight life and doing that was really a fiction and just wasn&#x27;t going to work out. Luckily I wasn&#x27;t far enough into it for it to be shattering or anything; it was like a realization that just made me feel immensely relieved.&quot;

In 1965, Mother McCree&#x27;s Uptown Jug Champions evolved into the Warlocks, with the addition of Dana Morgan, Jr. (soon replaced by Phil Lesh) on bass guitar and Bill Kreutzmann on percussion. However, the band discovered a record by another group (possibly the future Velvet Underground or Z.Z. Top, both of which used the name in their early days) called The Warlocks. In response, Garcia came up with &quot;Grateful Dead&quot; by opening a Funk &amp; Wagnalls dictionary to an entry for &quot;Grateful dead&quot;. The definition for &quot;Grateful dead&quot; was &quot;a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial&quot;. The band&#x27;s first reaction was disapproval. Garcia later explained the group&#x27;s reaction: &quot;I didn&#x27;t like it really, I just found it to be really powerful. [Bob] Weir didn&#x27;t like it, [Bill] Kreutzmann didn&#x27;t like it and nobody really wanted to hear about it.&quot; Despite their dislike of the name, it quickly spread by word of mouth, and soon became their official title.

===Career with the Grateful Dead===
Garcia served as lead guitarist and one of the principal vocalists and songwriters of the Grateful Dead for the band&#x27;s entire career. Garcia composed songs such as &quot;Uncle John&#x27;s Band&quot;, &quot;Dark Star&quot;, &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Tower&quot;, and &quot;Scarlet Begonias&quot;, among many others. Robert Hunter, an ardent collaborator with the band, wrote the lyrics to all but a few of Garcia&#x27;s songs.

Garcia was known for his &quot;soulful extended guitar improvisations&quot;, which would frequently feature interplay between him and his fellow band members. His fame, as well as the band&#x27;s, arguably rested on their ability to never play a song the same way twice. Often, Garcia would take cues from rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, remarking that &quot;there are some [...] kinds of ideas that would really throw me if I had to create a harmonic bridge between all the things going on rhythmically with two drums and Phil [Lesh&#x27;s] innovative bass playing. Weir&#x27;s ability to solve that sort of problem is extraordinary. [...] Harmonically, I take a lot of my solo cues from Bob.&quot;

When asked to describe his approach to soloing, Garcia commented: &quot;It keeps on changing. I still basically revolve around the melody and the way it&#x27;s broken up into phrases as I perceive them. With most solos, I tend to play something that phrases the way the melody does; my phrases may be more dense or have different value, but they&#x27;ll occur in the same places in the song. [...]&quot;

Garcia and the band toured almost constantly from their formation in 1965 until Garcia&#x27;s death in 1995. Periodically, there were breaks due to exhaustion or health problems, often due to Garcia&#x27;s drug use. During their three-decade span, the Grateful Dead played 2,314 shows.
Garcia&#x27;s guitar-playing was eclectic. He melded elements from the various kinds of music that influenced him. Echoes of bluegrass playing (such as Arthur Smith and Doc Watson) could be heard. There was also early rock (like Lonnie Mack, James Burton, and Chuck Berry), contemporary blues (Freddie King and Lowell Fulsom), country and western (Roy Nichols and Don Rich), and jazz (Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt) to be heard in Garcia&#x27;s style. Don Rich was the sparkling country guitar player in Buck Owens&#x27;s &quot;the Buckaroos&quot; band of the 1960s, but besides Rich&#x27;s style, both Garcia&#x27;s pedal steel guitar playing (on Grateful Dead records and others) and his standard electric guitar work, were influenced by another of Owens&#x27;s Buckaroos of that time, pedal steel player Tom Brumley. And as an improvisational soloist, John Coltrane was one of his greatest personal and musical influences.

Garcia later described his playing style as having &quot;descended from barroom rock and roll, country guitar. Just &#x27;cause that&#x27;s where all my stuff comes from. It&#x27;s like that blues instrumental stuff that was happening in the late Fifties and early Sixties, like Freddie King.&quot; Garcia&#x27;s style could vary with the song being played and the instrument he was using, but his playing had a number of so-called &quot;signatures&quot;. Among these were lead lines based on rhythmic triplets (examples include the songs &quot;Good Morning Little School Girl&quot;, &quot;New Speedway Boogie&quot;, &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;, &quot;Deal&quot;, &quot;Loser&quot;, &quot;Truckin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s It for the Other One&quot;, &quot;U.S. Blues&quot;, &quot;Sugaree&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Ease Me In&quot;).

===Side projects===
In addition to the Grateful Dead, Garcia participated in numerous musical side projects, including the Jerry Garcia Band. He was also involved with various acoustic projects such as Old &amp; In the Way and other bluegrass bands, including collaborations with noted bluegrass mandolinist David Grisman. The documentary film &quot;Grateful Dawg&quot;, co-produced by Gillian Grisman and former NBC producer Pamela Hamilton chronicles the deep, long-term friendship between Garcia and Grisman. When Garcia and Grisman released Not For Kids Only, Hamilton produced their interview and concert for NBC. After several years of producing stories on the Grateful Dead and band members&#x27; side projects, Hamilton interviewed Bob Weir for a feature on Garcia&#x27;s death marking the end of an era.

Other groups in which Garcia participated at one time or another include Jerry &amp; Sara (with his first wife), the Zodiacs (on bass), the Black Mountain Boys, Legion of Mary, Reconstruction, and the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band. Garcia was also a fan of jazz artists and improvisation: he played with jazz keyboardists Merl Saunders and Howard Wales for many years in various groups and jam sessions, and he appeared on saxophonist Ornette Coleman&#x27;s 1988 album, &quot;Virgin Beauty&quot;. His collaboration with Merl Saunders and Muruga Booker on the world music album &quot;Blues From the Rainforest&quot; launched the Rainforest Band.

Garcia spent a lot of time in the recording studio helping out fellow musician friends in session work, often adding guitar, vocals, pedal steel, sometimes banjo and piano and even producing. He played on over 50 studio albums, the styles of which were eclectic and varied, including bluegrass, rock, folk, blues, country, jazz, electronic music, gospel, funk, and reggae. Artists who sought Garcia&#x27;s help included the likes of Jefferson Airplane (most notably &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot;, Garcia being listed as their &quot;spiritual advisor&quot;). Garcia himself recalled in a mid-1967 interview that he&#x27;d played the high lead on &quot;Today,&quot; played on &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot; and &quot;Comin&#x27; Back to Me&quot; on that album. Others include Tom Fogerty, David Bromberg, Robert Hunter (&quot;Liberty&quot;, on Relix Records), Paul Pena, Peter Rowan, Warren Zevon, Country Joe McDonald, Pete Sears, Ken Nordine, Ornette Coleman, Bruce Hornsby, Bob Dylan, It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day, and many more. In 1995 Garcia played on three tracks for the CD &quot;Blue Incantation&quot; by guitarist Sanjay Mishra, making it his last studio collaboration.

Throughout the early 1970s, Garcia, Lesh, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, and David Crosby collaborated intermittently with MIT-educated composer and biologist Ned Lagin on several projects in the realm of early ambient music; these include the album &quot;Seastones&quot; (released by Ned Lagin on the Round Records subsidiary) and &quot;L&quot;, an unfinished dance work composed by Ned Lagin. In 1970, Garcia participated in the soundtrack for the film &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;.

Garcia also played pedal steel guitar for fellow-San Francisco musicians New Riders of the Purple Sage from their initial dates in 1969 to October 1971, when increased commitments with the Dead forced him to opt out of the group. He appears as a band member on their debut album &quot;New Riders of the Purple Sage&quot;, and produced &quot;Home, Home on the Road&quot;, a 1974 live album by the band. He also contributed pedal steel guitar to the enduring hit &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; by Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young. Garcia also played steel guitar licks on Brewer &amp; Shipley&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Tarkio&quot;. Despite considering himself a novice on the pedal steel, Garcia routinely ranked high in player polls. After a long lapse from playing the pedal steel, he played it once more during several of the Dead&#x27;s concerts with Bob Dylan in the summer of 1987.

In 1988, Garcia agreed to perform at several major benefits including the &quot;Soviet American Peace Walk&quot; concert at the Band Shell, in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, that drew 25,000 people. He was asked to play by longtime friend and fellow musician, Pete Sears, who played piano with all the bands that day, and also procured all the other musicians. Garcia, Mickey Hart and Steve Parish played the show, then were given a police escort to a Grateful Dead show across the bay later that night. Garcia also played with Nick Gravenites and Pete Sears at a benefit given for Vietnam Veteran and peace activist Brian Willson, who lost both legs below the knee when he attempted to block a train carrying weapons to military dictatorships in El Salvador.

Having previously studied at the San Francisco Art Institute as a teenager, Garcia embarked on a second career in the visual arts in the late 1980s. He created a number of drawings, etchings, and water colors. Garcia&#x27;s artistic endeavors were represented by the Weir Gallery in Berkeley, California from 1989 to 1996. During this period, Roberta Weir (unrelated to Garcia&#x27;s bandmate Bob Weir) provided Garcia with new art techniques to use, sponsored his first solo show in 1990, and prepared blank etching plates for him to draw on. These would then be processed and printed by gallery staff and brought back to Garcia for approval and signature, usually with a passing of stacks of paper backstage at a Dead show. His annual shows at the Weir Gallery garnered much attention, leading to further shows in New York and other cities. Garcia was an early adopter of digital art media; his artistic style was as varied as his musical output, and he carried small notebooks for pen and ink sketches wherever he toured. Roberta Weir continues to maintain an archive of the artwork of Jerry Garcia. Perhaps the most widely seen pieces of Jerry Garcia&#x27;s art are the many editions of men&#x27;s neckties produced by Stonehenge Ltd. and Mulberry Neckware. Some began as etchings, other designs came from his drawings, paintings, and digital art. Garcia&#x27;s artwork has since expanded into everything from hotel rooms, wet suits, men&#x27;s sport shirts, a women&#x27;s wear line, boxer shorts, hair accessories, cummerbunds, silk scarves and wool rugs.

==Personal life==
Garcia met his first wife, Sara Ruppenthal, in 1963. She was working at the coffee house in the back of Kepler&#x27;s Books, where Garcia, Hunter, and Nelson regularly performed. They married on April 23, 1963, and on December 8 of that year, their daughter Heather was born. They divorced in 1967.

Carolyn Adams, a Merry Prankster also known as &quot;Mountain Girl&quot; or &quot;M.G.,&quot; had a daughter, Sunshine, with Ken Kesey in 1966. Adams married another Prankster, George Walker, but they soon separated. She and Sunshine then moved into 710 Ashbury with Garcia in late 1966 where they would ultimately live together until 1975. Adams gave birth to Garcia&#x27;s second and third daughters, Annabelle Walker Garcia (b. February 2, 1970) and Theresa Adams &quot;Trixie&quot; Garcia (b. September 21, 1974).

In August 1970, Garcia&#x27;s mother Ruth was involved in a car crash near Twin Peaks in San Francisco. Garcia, who was recording the album &quot;American Beauty&quot; at the time, often left the sessions to visit his mother with his brother Clifford. She died on September 28, 1970.

In the midst of a March 1973 Grateful Dead engagement at Long Island&#x27;s Nassau Coliseum, Garcia met Deborah Koons, an aspiring filmmaker from a wealthy Cincinnati, Ohio-based family who would much later marry him and become his widow. After a brief correspondence, he began his relationship with her in mid-1974. This gradually strained his relationship with Adams and culminated in Garcia leaving Adams for Koons in late 1975. The end of his relationship with Koons in 1977 precipitated a brief reconciliation with Adams, including the reestablishment of their household. However, she did not agree with the guitarist&#x27;s persistent use of narcotics and moved with the children to the Eugene, Oregon area, living near Kesey, in 1978.

Following Adams&#x27; departure, Garcia had an affair with Amy Moore. She was a Kentucky-born member of the extended &quot;Grateful Dead family&quot;, and the mistress of Texas oil heir Roy Cullen. Their affair lasted circa 1980–1981, and inspired the Garcia-Hunter song &quot;Run for the Roses.&quot;

Adams and Garcia were married on December 31, 1981, largely as a result of mutual tax exigencies. Despite the legal codification of their union, she remained in Oregon, while Garcia continued to live near the Grateful Dead&#x27;s offices in San Rafael, California. Garcia lived with a variety of housemates, including longtime Grateful Dead employee and Jerry Garcia Band manager Rock Scully. Scully, who co-managed the Grateful Dead throughout the mid-to-late 1960s before serving as the band&#x27;s &quot;advance man&quot; and publicist, was dismissed by the group in 1984 for enabling Garcia&#x27;s addictions and for allegedly embezzling the Garcia Band&#x27;s profits. Another housemate was Nora Sage, a Deadhead who became Garcia&#x27;s housekeeper while studying at the Golden Gate University School of Law. The exact nature of their relationship remains unclear, although it is believed to have been platonic due to Garcia&#x27;s addictions. She later became his art representative.

While they would briefly reunite following his diabetic coma, Garcia and Adams ultimately divorced in 1994. Phil Lesh has subsequently stated that he rarely saw Adams on any of the band tours. In a 1991 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Garcia stated that &quot;we haven&#x27;t really lived together since the Seventies&quot;.

During the autumn of 1978, Garcia developed a friendship with Shimer College student Manasha Matheson, an artist and music enthusiast. They remained friends over the following nine years before initiating a romantic relationship in Hartford, Connecticut on the Grateful Dead&#x27;s spring 1987 tour. Jerry and Manasha became parents with the birth of their daughter, Keelin Noel Garcia, on December 20, 1987. On August 17, 1990, Garcia and Matheson married at their San Anselmo, California home in a spiritual ceremony free of legal convention. In 1991, Garcia expressed his delight in finding the time to &quot;actually be a father&quot; to Keelin in contrast to his past relationships with his children. A year later, Garcia dedicated his first art book, &quot;Paintings, Drawings and Sketches&quot;, &quot;For Manasha, with love, Jerry.&quot;

In January 1993, Barbara &quot;Brigid&quot; Meier, a former girlfriend from the early 1960s, reentered Garcia&#x27;s life for a brief period. Meier claimed that Garcia had considered her to be the &quot;love of his life&quot; and proposed to her during a Hawaiian vacation shortly after their relationship recommenced. Garcia&#x27;s &quot;love of his life&quot; sentiment was not reserved for one lover, as he expressed the same feelings to several other women in his life. At Garcia&#x27;s 1995 funeral, Koons declared that she was &quot;the love of his life&quot; while paying her final respects, whereupon Meier and Ruppenthal, who were both in attendance, simultaneously exclaimed, &quot;He said that to me!&quot;

The affair with Meier marked the breakup of Garcia&#x27;s family life with Matheson and Keelin. Garcia ended the affair with Meier forty-five days later while on tour in Chicago with the Grateful Dead after she confronted him about his drug use.

Shortly thereafter, Garcia renewed his acquaintance with Deborah Koons in the spring of 1993. They married on February 14, 1994, in Sausalito, California. Garcia and Koons were married at the time of his death.

===Lifestyle and health===
Because of their public profile, Garcia and his collaborators were occasionally singled out in the American government&#x27;s war on drugs. On October 2, 1967, 710 Ashbury Street in San Francisco (where the Grateful Dead had taken up residence the year before) was raided after a police tip-off. Grateful Dead members Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, and Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan were apprehended on marijuana charges which were later dropped, although Garcia himself was not arrested. The following year, Garcia&#x27;s picture was used in a campaign commercial for Richard Nixon.

Most of the band was arrested again in January 1970, after it flew to New Orleans from Hawaii. After returning to their hotel from a performance, the band checked into their rooms, only to be quickly raided by police. Approximately fifteen people were arrested on the spot, including many of the road crew, management, and nearly all of the Grateful Dead except for Garcia, who arrived later, outgoing keyboardist Tom Constanten, who abstained from all drugs as a member of the Church of Scientology, and McKernan, who eschewed illegal drugs in favor of alcohol.

According to Bill Kreutzmann, the band&#x27;s use of cocaine accelerated throughout the early 1970s. After using heroin in a brothel in 1974 (likely on the band&#x27;s second European tour), Garcia was introduced to a smokeable form of the drug (initially advertised as refined opium) colloquially known as &quot;Persian&quot; or &quot;Persian Base&quot; during the group&#x27;s 1975 hiatus. Influenced by the stresses of creating and releasing &quot;The Grateful Dead Movie&quot; and the acrimonious collapse of the band&#x27;s independent record labels over the next two years, Garcia became increasingly dependent upon both substances. These factors, combined with the alcohol and drug abuse of several other members of the Grateful Dead, resulted in a turbulent atmosphere. By 1978, the band&#x27;s chemistry began &quot;cracking and crumbling&quot;, resulting in poor group cohesion. As a result, Keith and Donna Jean Godchaux left the band in February 1979.

With the addition of keyboardist/vocalist Brent Mydland that year amid the ongoing coalescence of the Deadhead subculture, the band reached new commercial heights as a touring group on the American arena circuit in the early 1980s, enabling them to forsake studio recording for several years. Nevertheless, this was offset by such factors as the band&#x27;s atypically large payroll and Garcia&#x27;s $700-a-day () drug addiction, resulting in the guitarist taking on a frenetic slate of solo touring outside of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s rigorous schedule, including abbreviated acoustic duo concerts with Jerry Garcia Band bassist John Kahn that were widely rumored to be a funding conduit for their respective addictions.

Though things seemed to be getting better for the band, Garcia&#x27;s health was declining. By 1983, Garcia&#x27;s demeanor onstage had appeared to change. Despite still playing the guitar with great passion and intensity, there were times that he would appear disengaged; as such, shows were often inconsistent. Years of heavy tobacco smoking had affected his voice, and he gained considerable weight. By 1984, he would often rest his chin on the microphone during performances. The so-called &quot;endless tour&quot;—the result of years of financial risks, drug use, and poor business decisions—had taken its toll.

Garcia&#x27;s decade-long heroin addiction culminated in the rest of the band holding an intervention in January 1985. Given the choice between the band or the drugs, Garcia agreed to check into a rehabilitation center in Oakland, California. A few days later, on January 19, before the start of his program in Oakland, Garcia was arrested for drug possession in Golden Gate Park; he subsequently attended a drug diversion program. Throughout 1985, he tapered his drug use on tour and at home with the assistance of Nora Sage; by the spring of 1986, he was completely abstinent.

Precipitated by an unhealthy weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, and a recent relapse on the Grateful Dead&#x27;s first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later. He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: &quot;Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle in a sort of futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of protoplasm that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off.&quot; Garcia&#x27;s coma had a profound effect on him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.

After Garcia&#x27;s recovery, the band released a comeback album &quot;In the Dark&quot; in 1987, which became their best-selling studio album. Inspired by Garcia&#x27;s improved health, a successful album and the continuing emergence of Mydland as a third frontman, the band&#x27;s energy and chemistry reached a new peak in the late 1980s.

Amid a litany of personal problems, Mydland died of a speedball overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, leading him to believe that the band&#x27;s chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists Vince Welnick and Bruce Hornsby. As the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band&#x27;s future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia began using heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited Phil Lesh over to his home in San Rafael, California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a methadone clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way and return to making music.

After returning from the band&#x27;s 1992 summer tour, Garcia became sick, a throwback to his diabetic coma in 1986. Manasha Garcia nursed Garcia back to health and organized a team of health professionals which included acupuncturist Yen Wei Choong and Randy Baker, MD, a holistic family physician to treat him at home. Garcia recovered over the following days, despite the Grateful Dead having to cancel their fall tour to allow him time to recuperate. Garcia reduced his cigarette smoking and began losing weight. He also became a vegetarian.

Despite these improvements, Garcia&#x27;s physical and mental condition continued to decline throughout 1993 and 1994. He began to use narcotics again to dull the pain. In light of his second drug relapse and current condition, Garcia checked himself into the Betty Ford Center during July 1995. His stay was limited, lasting only two weeks. Motivated by the experience, he then checked into the Serenity Knolls treatment center in Forest Knolls, California, where he died.

==Death==
Garcia died in his room at the rehabilitation clinic on August 9, 1995. The cause of death was a heart attack, likely due to diabetes and his poor diet. Garcia had long struggled with diabetes, weight problems, sleep apnea, heavy smoking, and drug addiction—all of which contributed to his physical decline. Lesh remarked that, upon hearing of Garcia&#x27;s death, &quot;I was struck numb. I had lost my oldest surviving friend, my brother.&quot; Garcia&#x27;s funeral was held on August 12, at St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Belvedere. It was attended by his family, the remaining Grateful Dead members, and their friends, including Bill Walton and Bob Dylan. Deborah Koons barred two of Garcia&#x27;s former wives from the ceremony.

On August 13, about 25,000 people attended a municipally sanctioned public memorial at the Polo Fields of San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park. Crowds produced hundreds of flowers, gifts, images, and a bagpipe rendition of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; in remembrance. In the Haight, a single white rose was reportedly tied to a tree near the Dead&#x27;s former Haight-Ashbury house, where a group of followers gathered to mourn.

On the morning of April 4, 1996, after a total lunar eclipse earlier that day, Weir and Deborah Koons, accompanied by Sanjay Mishra, spread half of Garcia&#x27;s ashes into the Ganges at the holy city of Rishikesh, India, a site sacred to Hindus. The remaining ashes were poured into the San Francisco Bay. Koons did not allow former wife Carolyn Garcia to attend the spreading of the ashes.

== Musical equipment ==

Garcia played many guitars during his career, which ranged from student and budget models to custom-made instruments. During his thirty-five-year career as a professional musician, Garcia used about 25 guitars.

In 1965, when Garcia was playing with the Warlocks, he used a Guild Starfire, which he also used on the début album of the Grateful Dead. Beginning in late 1967 and ending in 1968, Garcia played black or gold mid-1950s Gibson Les Paul guitars with P-90 pickups. In 1969, he picked up the Gibson SG and used it for most of that year and 1970, except for a small period in between where he used a sunburst Fender Stratocaster.

During Garcia&#x27;s &quot;pedal steel flirtation period&quot; (as Bob Weir referred to it in &quot;Anthem to Beauty&quot;), from approximately 1969 to 1972, he initially played a Fender instrument before upgrading to the ZB Custom D-10, especially in his earlier public performances. Although this was a double neck guitar, Garcia used the &quot;E9 neck and the three pedals to raise the tone and two levers to lower it.&quot; He employed an Emmons D-10 at the Grateful Dead&#x27;s and New Riders of the Purple Sage&#x27;s final appearances at the Fillmore East in April 1971.

In 1969, Garcia played pedal steel on three notable outside recordings: the track &quot;The Farm&quot; on the Jefferson Airplane album &quot;Volunteers&quot;, the track &quot;Oh Mommy&quot; by Brewer and Shipley and the hit single &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young from their album &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, released in 1970. Garcia played on the latter album in exchange for harmony lessons for the Grateful Dead, who were at the time recording &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead&quot;.

In 1971, Garcia began playing a sunburst Les Paul. In March and April 1971 – the time period during which the Grateful Dead recorded its second live album, &quot;Grateful Dead&quot; – Garcia played the &quot;Peanut,&quot; a guitar he had received from Rick Turner, who had custom built the guitar&#x27;s body and incorporated the neck, pickups, and hardware from an early &#x27;60s Les Paul.
In May, Garcia began using a 1955 natural finish Stratocaster that had been given to him by Graham Nash in 1969. Garcia added an alligator sticker to the pickguard in the fall of 1971, and the thusly-named &quot;Alligator&quot; would remain Garcia&#x27;s principal electric guitar until August 1973.
In the summer of 1971, Garcia also played a double-cutaway Les Paul TV Junior.
While Alligator was in the shop in the summer of 1972, he briefly reverted to the sunburst Stratocaster; this can be seen in &quot;Sunshine Daydream&quot;.

In late 1972, Garcia purchased the first guitar (&quot;Eagle&quot;) made by Alembic luthier Doug Irwin for $850 (). Enamored of Irwin&#x27;s talents, he immediately commissioned his own custom instrument. This guitar, nicknamed &quot;Wolf&quot; for a sticker Garcia added below the tailpiece, was delivered in May 1973 and replaced Alligator on stage in September. It cost $1,500 (), an extremely high price for the era.

Wolf was made with an ebony fingerboard and featured numerous embellishments like alternating grain designs in the headstock, ivory inlays, and fret marker dots made of sterling silver. The body was composed of western maple wood which had a core of purpleheart. Garcia later had Irwin (who ultimately left Alembic to start his own business) replace the electronics inside the guitar, at which point he added his own logo to the headstock alongside the Alembic logo. The system included two interchangeable plates for configuring pickups: one was made for strictly single coils, while the other accommodated humbuckers. Shortly after receiving the modified instrument, Garcia commissioned another custom guitar from Irwin with one caveat: &quot;Don&#x27;t hold back.&quot;

During the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 1974 European tour, Wolf was dropped on several occasions, one of which caused a minor crack in the headstock. Following filming of &quot;The Grateful Dead Movie&quot; (in which the guitar is prominently visible) a month later, Garcia returned it to Irwin for repairs. Throughout its absence, Garcia predominantly played several Travis Bean guitars, including the TB1000A (1975) and the TB500 (1976-1977). On September 28, 1977, Irwin delivered the refurbished Wolf back to Garcia. The wolf sticker which gave the guitar its name had now been inlaid into the instrument; it also featured an effects loop between the pick-ups and controls (so inline effects would &quot;see&quot; the same signal at all times) which was bypassable. Irwin also put a new face on the headstock with only his logo (he later claimed to have built the guitar himself, though pictures through time clearly show the progression of logos, from Alembic, to Alembic &amp; Irwin, to only Irwin).

The Grateful Dead began using McIntosh Labs amplifiers in the mid-1960s at the insistence and funding of sound technician and prolific LSD chemist Owsley Stanley. Garcia began using a specific McIntosh MC 2300 in 1973, eventually christened with a Budweiser Budman sticker placed on the front in 1974 and making it a unique way of identifying Garcia&#x27;s specific MC 2300 out of the many that powered the Wall of Sound. &quot;Budman&quot; was one of the only components from the Wall to continue traveling with Garcia until 1993 when it was replaced with a cab simulation system.
The Budman amp is the longest continuously used piece of gear in Grateful Dead history. On 14 October 2021 during a Sotheby&#x27;s auction titled &quot;From the Vault: Property from the Grateful Dead and Friends&quot;. Garcia&#x27;s last stage rack containing a MC2300 sold for $226,800 USD. The MC2300 Budman sold for $378,000 USD.

Nearly seven years after he commissioned it, Garcia received his second custom guitar (&quot;Tiger&quot;) from Irwin in the summer of 1979.
He first employed the instrument in concert at a Grateful Dead performance at the Oakland Auditorium Arena on August 4, 1979. Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover.
The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was cocobolo, with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and flame maple, in that order. The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard. The pickups consisted of a single coil DiMarzio SDS-1 and two humbucker DiMarzio Super IIs; these were easily removable, accommodating Garcia&#x27;s preference for replacing his pickups every year or two. The electronics were composed of an effects bypass loop (which allowed Garcia to control the sound of his effects through the tone and volume controls on the guitar) and a preamplifier/buffer, which rested behind a plate in the back of the guitar. Fully outfitted, Tiger weighed . This was Garcia&#x27;s principal guitar for the next eleven years, and his most played. Due to the ongoing repair and retrofitting of other instruments, Garcia played Tiger during the last song (&quot;Box of Rain&quot;) of his final performance with the Grateful Dead at Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field on July 9, 1995.

In the late 1980s Garcia, Weir and CSN (along with many others) endorsed Alvarez Yairi acoustic guitars. There are many photographs circulating (mostly promotional) of Garcia playing a DY99 Virtuoso Custom with a Modulus graphite neck. He opted to play with the less decorated model but the promotional photo from the Alvarez Yairi catalog has him holding the &quot;tree of life&quot; model. This hand-built guitar was notable for the collaboration between Japanese luthier Kazuo Yairi and Modulus Graphite of San Rafael. Since Garcia&#x27;s death, the DY99 model has remained highly valued among collectors.

In 1990, Irwin completed &quot;Rosebud&quot;, Garcia&#x27;s fourth custom guitar. While similar to Tiger in many respects, it featured different inlays and electronics in addition to a slightly lighter weight. Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a tone control, while the middle had its own. Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar. The GK2 was used in conjunction with the Roland GR-50 rack mount synthesizer. In turn, the GR-50 synthesizer drove a Korg M1R synthesizer that produced MIDI effects during live performances of this period, as heard on the Grateful Dead&#x27;s &quot;Without a Net&quot; (1990) and other contemporaneous recordings. Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the weight down to . The inlay, a dancing skeleton holding a rose, covers a plate just below the bridge. The final cost of the instrument was $11,000 ().

In 1993, carpenter and aspiring luthier Stephen Cripe tried his hand at making a speculative instrument for Garcia. After researching Tiger through pictures and films, Cripe set out on what would soon become known as &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;, again named for its inlay. The guitar used Brazilian rosewood for the fingerboard and East Indian rosewood for the body, which, with admitted irony from Cripe, had been taken from a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers. Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was gifted by Cripe to Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively. However, as Cripe had little background in electronics, Garcia hired San Francisco-based repairman Gary Brawer to reconfigure the pickups and make the instrument MIDI-compatible. Additionally, Cripe &quot;hadn&#x27;t known that the oval-shaped body inlays on Tiger and Rosebud concealed their batteries, so Brawer had to remove his inlay and put it on a cover-plate.&quot; A new bridge also was installed during the final Grateful Dead tour.
Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar. Cripe, who had not measured or photographed the original, was told simply to &quot;wing it.&quot; Cripe later delivered the backup, which was known by the name &quot;Top Hat&quot;, in April 1995. Garcia bought it from him for $6,500, making it the first guitar that Cripe had ever sold. Still infatuated with Lightning Bolt, Garcia rarely used the backup.

After Garcia&#x27;s death, the ownership of Wolf and Tiger came into question. According to Garcia&#x27;s will, his guitars were bequeathed to Doug Irwin, who had constructed them. The remaining Grateful Dead members disagreed – they considered his guitars to be property of the band, leading to a lawsuit between the two parties. In 2001, Irwin won the case. However, nearly having been left destitute from a traffic accident in 1998, he decided to place the guitars up for auction in hopes of being able to start another guitar workshop.

On May 8, 2002, Wolf and Tiger, among other memorabilia, were placed for auction at Studio 54 in New York City. Tiger was sold for $957,500, and Wolf for $789,500. Together, the pair sold for $1.74 million, setting a new world record. Wolf went into in the private collection of Daniel Pritzker who kept it in a secure climate controlled room in a private residence at Utica, New York. Tiger went to the private collection of Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay. In May 2017, Wolf was again auctioned, but this time for charity. Pritzker decided to sell the guitar and donate all proceeds to the Montgomery, Alabama based Southern Poverty Law Center. Brian Halligan placed the winning bid totaling $1.9 million.

For the majority of 2019 Wolf and Tiger were included in the &quot;Play it Loud&quot; exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. On June 23, 2019 John Mayer played Wolf with Dead &amp; Company at Citi Field.

==Legacy==
Garcia was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead in 1994. He declined to attend the ceremony; the band jokingly brought a cardboard cutout of Garcia out on stage in his absence.

In 1987, Vermont ice cream maker Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s introduced their Cherry Garcia flavor dedicated to him. It was the first ice cream flavor dedicated to a musician.

Shortly after Garcia&#x27;s death, astronomers Simon Radford and Ed Olszewski named an asteroid that orbits between Mars and Jupiter after him in November 1995. Tom Gehrels, who had originally discovered the asteroid in 1985 but never named it, offered it to them for the occasion.

In 1998, a newly discovered species of roach was named &quot;Cryptocercus garciai&quot; after Garcia.

In 2000, the network NBC broadcast an animated sitcom, &quot;God, the Devil and Bob&quot;, which featured a &quot;God&quot; character based on Garcia&#x27;s appearance. Amid backlash from religious groups and low ratings, the series was cancelled after four episodes.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Jerry Garcia 13th in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.

According to fellow Bay Area guitar player Henry Kaiser, Garcia is &quot;the most recorded guitarist in history. With more than 2,200 Grateful Dead concerts, and 1,000 Jerry Garcia Band concerts captured on tape – as well as numerous studio sessions – there are about 15,000 hours of his guitar work preserved for the ages.&quot;

On July 30, 2004, Melvin Seals was the first Jerry Garcia Band (JGB) member to headline an outdoor music and camping festival called &quot;The Grateful Garcia Gathering&quot;. Jerry Garcia Band drummer David Kemper joined Melvin Seals and JGB in 2007. Other musicians and friends of Garcia include Donna Jean Godchaux, Mookie Siegel, Pete Sears, G.E. Smith, Chuck Hammer, Barry Sless, Jackie Greene, Brian Lesh, Sanjay Mishra, and Mark Karan.

On July 21, 2005, the San Francisco Recreation and Park Commission passed a resolution to name the amphitheater in McLaren Park the &quot;Jerry Garcia Amphitheater.&quot; The amphitheater is located in the Excelsior District, where Garcia grew up. The first show to happen at the Jerry Garcia Amphitheater was Jerry Day 2005 on August 7, 2005. Jerry&#x27;s brother, Tiff Garcia, was the first person to welcome everybody to the &quot;Jerry Garcia Amphitheater.&quot; Jerry Day is an annual celebration of Garcia in his childhood neighborhood. The dedication ceremony (Jerry Day 2) on October 29, 2005, was officiated by mayor Gavin Newsom.

On September 24, 2005, the &quot;Comes a Time: A Celebration of the Music &amp; Spirit of Jerry Garcia&quot; tribute concert was held at the Hearst Greek Theatre in Berkeley, California. The concert featured Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann, Mickey Hart, Bruce Hornsby, Trey Anastasio, Warren Haynes, Jimmy Herring, Michael Kang, Jay Lane, Jeff Chimenti, Mark Karan, Robin Sylvester, Kenny Brooks, Melvin Seals, Merl Saunders, Marty Holland, Stu Allen, Gloria Jones, and Jackie LaBranch.

Georgia-based composer Lee Johnson released an orchestral tribute to the music of the Grateful Dead, recorded with the Russian National Orchestra, entitled &quot;Dead Symphony: Lee Johnson Symphony No. 6.&quot; Johnson was interviewed on NPR on the July 26, 2008 broadcast of &quot;Weekend Edition&quot;, and gave much credit to the genius and craft of Garcia&#x27;s songwriting. A live performance with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Johnson himself, was held Friday, August 1.

In 2010, the Santa Barbara Bowl in California opened Jerry Garcia Glen along the walk up to the venue. There is a statue of Garcia&#x27;s right hand along the way.

Seattle rock band Soundgarden wrote and recorded the instrumental song &quot;Jerry Garcia&#x27;s Finger&quot;, dedicated to the singer, which was released as a b-side with their single &quot;Pretty Noose&quot;.

Numerous music festivals across the United States and Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK hold annual events in memory of Jerry Garcia.

On May 14, 2015, an all-star lineup held a tribute concert for Garcia at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland. The event was called &quot;Dear Jerry&quot;.

In 2015, Hunter and Garcia were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Hunter accepted the award along with Garcia&#x27;s daughter, Trixie Garcia, who accepted on behalf of her father.

In 2015, Jerry Garcia&#x27;s wife, Manasha Garcia and their daughter, Keelin Garcia launched The Jerry Garcia Foundation, a nonprofit charity that supports projects for artistic, environmental, and humanitarian causes. The Foundation&#x27;s Board members are Bob Weir, Peter Shapiro, Glenn Fischer, Irwin Sternberg, Daniel Shiner, TRI Studios CEO, Christopher McCutcheon and Fender Music Foundation Executive Director, 
Lynn Robison. Keelin Garcia said, &quot;It is a tremendous honor to participate in nonprofit work that is in accordance with my father&#x27;s values.&quot;

In 2017 Garcia&#x27;s music was featured in &quot;Red Roses, Green Gold&quot;, an off-Broadway musical featuring the music of Garcia and Robert Hunter, with additional music by Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, and Hunter&#x27;s longtime collaborator Greg Anton. The production was directed and choreographed by Rachel Klein, featured a book by Michael Norman Mann, had Jeff Chimenti serving as music supervisor, and was performed at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York City.

In 2018, Jerry Garcia family members, Keelin Garcia and Manasha Garcia launched the Jerry Garcia Music Arts independent music label.

On November 18, 2021, it was announced Jonah Hill would portray Garcia in a forthcoming Grateful Dead biopic written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski directed by Martin Scorsese for Apple TV+.

<text>This is a list of incorporated cities in Canada, in alphabetical order categorized by province or territory. More thorough lists of communities are available for each province.
== Capital cities ==
== Alberta == 
To qualify as a city in Alberta, a sufficient population size (10,000 people or more) must be present and a majority of the buildings must be on parcels of land less than . A community is not always incorporated as a city even if it meets these requirements. The urban service areas of Fort McMurray and Sherwood Park are hamlets recognized as equivalents of cities, but remain unincorporated. Ten towns are also eligible for city status but remain incorporated as towns.

Alberta has 19 cities. Beaumont is Alberta&#x27;s newest city, incorporating from town status on January 1, 2019.
&quot;Notes:&quot;
== British Columbia == 

In British Columbia, a community can be incorporated as a city if its population exceeds 5,000. Once so incorporated, a city does not lose this status even if its population later declines; the once-larger City of Greenwood, for example, now has a population of just 665 people.

British Columbia has 53 cities.
&quot;Notes:&quot;
== Manitoba ==
A community in Manitoba may seek city status once reaching a population of 7,500. Manitoba&#x27;s newest city is Morden, which changed from town to city status on August 24, 2012.

Manitoba has 10 cities.

&quot;Notes:&quot;
== New Brunswick == 

New Brunswick has eight cities.

&quot;Notes:&quot;
== Newfoundland and Labrador ==
Newfoundland and Labrador has three cities.
&quot;Notes:&quot;
== Northwest Territories ==

As in the other two Canadian territories, the only incorporated city in the Northwest Territories is its capital, Yellowknife.
== Nova Scotia ==
Nova Scotia no longer has any incorporated cities, as they were amalgamated into regional municipalities in the 1990s.

*Halifax – provincial capital and metropolitan area and formerly the largest city in Nova Scotia by population, now part of the Halifax Regional Municipality
*Sydney – formerly the smallest city in Nova Scotia by population, now part of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality
*Dartmouth – formerly a city in Nova Scotia, now part of the Halifax Regional Municipality

== Nunavut ==

As in the other two Canadian territories, the only incorporated city in Nunavut is its capital, Iqaluit.
== Ontario ==

Ontario has 52 cities. In Ontario, city status is conferred by the provincial government, generally upon the request of the incorporated municipality. A municipality may apply for city status anytime after its population surpasses 10,000. This status is not &quot;automatically&quot; conferred on a community that reaches this population target, but must be requested by the municipality and granted by the provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. Not all municipalities which reach this population target have pursued city designation. For example, Ajax, Oakville, and Whitby, which all had populations greater than 100,000 in 2011, are still designated as towns. Once designated a city, however, a municipality does not lose this status even if its population later falls back below 10,000 (as, for example, Dryden). Ontario&#x27;s newest city is Richmond Hill, which changed from town to city status on March 25, 2019.

&quot;Notes:&quot;
== Prince Edward Island ==
Prince Edward Island has two cities.
&quot;Notes:&quot;
== Quebec == 

In Quebec, provincial law does not contain any &quot;cities&quot; at the current time, although the designation exists. — A &quot;ville&quot;, though legally a &quot;township&quot;, may be informally referred to as a town or a city in English, but this is an arbitrary and subjective distinction. Quebec municipal types are &quot;cities&quot; (cités), &quot;townships&quot; (villes), and &quot;municipalités&quot; (municipalités).

Quebec has 223 villes.

&quot;Notes:&quot;
== Saskatchewan == 

In Saskatchewan, Section 39(1) of &quot;The Cities Act&quot; indicates a town must have a population of 5,000 or more and meet other criteria in order to incorporate as a city, although in the early 20th century several centres such as Saskatoon and Regina were granted city status despite having a smaller population. The City of Melville retains its city status despite dropping below 5,000 people in the 1990s. Kindersley has expressed an interest in applying for city status upon reaching the 5,000 milestone. Saskatchewan&#x27;s newest city is Warman, which changed from town to city status on October 24, 2012.

Saskatchewan has 16 cities.

&quot;Notes:&quot;
== Yukon ==

As in the other two Canadian territories, the only incorporated city in the Yukon is its capital, Whitehorse. Dawson was also previously incorporated as a city, but when the criteria were changed in the 1980s, its status was reduced to that of a town due to population. Through special provision, however, it was officially the town of the city of Dawson until 2001.

<doc id="75763" wikidata="Q2879" url="?curid=75763" title="Provinces and territories of Canada">
<text>Canada has ten provinces and three territories that are sub-national administrative divisions under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Constitution. In the 1867 Canadian Confederation, three provinces of British North America—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada (which upon Confederation was divided into Ontario and Quebec)—united to form a federation, becoming a fully independent country over the next century. Over its history, Canada&#x27;s international borders have changed several times as it has added territories and provinces, making it the world&#x27;s second-largest country by area.

The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their power and authority from the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; (formerly called the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;), whereas territories are federal territories whose governments are creatures of statute with powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada. The powers flowing from the &quot;Constitution Act&quot; are divided between the Government of Canada (the federal government) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively. A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a constitutional amendment, whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government.

In modern Canadian constitutional theory, the provinces are considered to be co-sovereign within certain areas based on the divisions of responsibility between the provincial and federal government within the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, and each province thus has its own representative of the Canadian Crown, the lieutenant governor. The territories are not sovereign, but instead their authorities and responsibilities are devolved directly from the federal level, and as a result, have a commissioner that represents the federal government.

==Provinces==
==Territories==
There are three territories in Canada. Unlike the provinces, the territories of Canada have no inherent sovereignty and have only those powers delegated to them by the federal government. They include all of mainland Canada north of latitude 60° north and west of Hudson Bay and all islands north of the Canadian mainland (from those in James Bay to the Queen Elizabeth Islands). They cover 40% of Canada&#x27;s land but only represent 0.3% of the population.

Another territory, the District of Keewatin, existed from October 7, 1876, until September 1, 1905, when it rejoined the Northwest Territories and became the Keewatin Region. It occupied the area that is now the Kenora District of Ontario, northern Manitoba, and mainland Nunavut. The government of Keewatin was based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The territory did not have any representation in federal parliament.

==Population==

The vast majority of Canada&#x27;s population is concentrated in areas close to the Canada–US border. Its four largest provinces by area (Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta) are also (with Quebec and Ontario switched in order) its most populous; together they account for 86% of the country&#x27;s population. The territories (the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon) account for over a third of Canada&#x27;s area but are only home to 0.3% of its population, which skews the national population density value.

Canada&#x27;s population grew by 5.0% between the 2006 and 2011 censuses. Except for New Brunswick, all territories and provinces increased in population during this time. In terms of percent change, the fastest-growing province or territory was Nunavut with an increase of 12.7% between 2011 and 2016, followed by Alberta with 11.6% growth, while New Brunswick&#x27;s population decreased by 0.5%.

Generally, Canadian provinces have steadily grown in population along with Canada. However, some provinces such as Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador have experienced long periods of stagnation or population decline. Ontario and Quebec have always been the two biggest provinces in Canada, with together over 60% of the population at any given time. The population of the West relative to Canada as a whole has steadily grown over time, while that of Atlantic Canada has declined.

==Territorial evolution==


Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia were the original provinces, formed when several British North American colonies federated on July 1, 1867, into the Dominion of Canada and by stages began accruing the indicia of sovereignty from the United Kingdom. Prior to this, Ontario and Quebec were united as the Province of Canada. Over the following years, Manitoba (1870), British Columbia (1871), and Prince Edward Island (1873) were added as provinces.

The British Crown had claimed two large areas north-west of the Canadian colony, known as Rupert&#x27;s Land and the North-Western Territory, and assigned them to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. In 1870, the company relinquished its claims for £300,000 (CND$1.5 million), assigning the vast territory to the government of Canada. Subsequently, the area was re-organized into the province of Manitoba and the North-West Territories. The North-West Territories encompassed all of current northern and western Canada, except for the British holdings in the Arctic islands and the Colony of British Columbia. NWT included the northern two-thirds of Ontario and Quebec. After the province of Manitoba was established in 1870, in a small area in the south of today&#x27;s province, almost all of present-day Manitoba was still contained in the NWT. (Manitoba expanded to its present size in 1912.)

The British claims to the Arctic islands were transferred to Canada in 1880, adding to the size of the North-West Territories. In 1898 the Yukon Territory, later renamed &quot;Yukon&quot; in 2003, was carved from the area surrounding the Klondike gold fields. On September 1, 1905, a portion of the North-West Territories south of the 60th parallel north became the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In 1912, the boundaries of Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba were expanded northward: Manitoba&#x27;s to the 60° parallel, Ontario&#x27;s to Hudson Bay and Quebec&#x27;s to encompass the District of Ungava.

In 1869, the people of Newfoundland voted to remain a British colony over fears that taxes would increase with Confederation, and that the economic policy of the Canadian government would favour mainland industries. In 1907, Newfoundland acquired dominion status. In the middle of the Great Depression in Canada, Newfoundland underwent a prolonged economic crisis, and the legislature turned over political control to the Newfoundland Commission of Government in 1933. Following Canada&#x27;s participation in the Second World War, in a 1948 referendum, a narrow majority of Newfoundland citizens voted to join the Confederation, and on March 31, 1949, Newfoundland became Canada&#x27;s tenth province. The province was officially renamed Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001.

Bermuda, the last British North American colony, which had been somewhat subordinated to Nova Scotia, was one of two Imperial fortress colonies in British North America the other being Nova Scotia, and more particularly the city of Halifax. Halifax and Bermuda were the sites of the Royal Navy&#x27;s North America Station (or, depending on the time period and the extent of the Western Hemisphere it included, the &quot;River St. Lawrence and Coast of America and North America and West Indies Station&quot;, the &quot;North America and Newfoundland Station&quot;, the &quot;North America and West Indies Station&quot;, and finally the &quot;America and West Indies Station&quot;) main bases, dockyards, and Admiralty Houses. The squadron of the station was based at Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax, during the summers and Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda, in the winters until the 1820s, when Bermuda (which was better located to control the Atlantic Seaboard of the United States, impossible to attack over land, and almost impregnable against attack over water) became the main base year round. A large British Army garrison in Bermuda, which fell under the commander-in-chief in Nova Scotia, existed to defend the colony as a naval base (and to prevent it becoming as useful a base to the navy of an adversary), as well as to support amphibious operations throughout the region (such as the Chesapeake campaign during the American War of 1812). Bermuda was consequently the most important British naval and military base in the Americas. Canadian confederation resulted in the Canadian Militia becoming responsible for the defence of the Maritimes, the abolition of the British Army&#x27;s commander-in-chief there, and the reduction of British military forces in the Maritimes to a small garrison for the protection of the Halifax dockyard, which would be withdrawn when that dockyard was handed over to the Dominion government in 1905 for use by the new Canadian naval service. Britain retained control of Bermuda as an imperial fortress, with the governor and commander-in-chief of Bermuda (a military officer previously ranking between lieutenant-colonel and major-general) becoming a lieutenant-general termed a &quot;general officer commanding&quot; and the Bermuda garrison becoming a command in its own right. Bermuda was consequently left out of the confederation of Canada, though it retained naval links with Halifax and the state church (or &quot;established church&quot;), the Church of England, continued to place Bermuda under the bishop of Newfoundland until 1919 (Bermuda also remained linked to the Maritimes under the Methodist and Roman Catholic churches).

In 1903, resolution of the Alaska Panhandle Dispute fixed British Columbia&#x27;s northwestern boundary. This was one of only two provinces in Canadian history to have its size reduced. The second reduction, in 1927, occurred when a boundary dispute between Canada and the Dominion of Newfoundland saw Labrador enlarged at Quebec&#x27;s expense; this land returned to Canada, as part of the province of Newfoundland, in 1949. In 1999, Nunavut was created from the eastern portion of the Northwest Territories. Yukon lies in the western portion of Northern Canada, while Nunavut is in the east.

All three territories combined are the most sparsely populated region in Canada, covering in land area. They are often referred to as a single region, the North, for organizational and economic purposes. For much of the Northwest Territories&#x27; early history it was divided into several districts for ease of administration. The District of Keewatin was created as a separate territory from 1876 to 1905, after which, as the Keewatin Region, it became an administrative district of the Northwest Territories. In 1999, it was dissolved when it became part of Nunavut.

==Government==
Theoretically, provinces have a great deal of power relative to the federal government, with jurisdiction over many public goods such as health care, education, welfare, and intra-provincial transportation. They receive &quot;transfer payments&quot; from the federal government to pay for these, as well as exacting their own taxes. In practice, however, the federal government can use these transfer payments to influence these provincial areas. For instance, in order to receive healthcare funding under Medicare, provinces must agree to meet certain federal mandates, such as universal access to required medical treatment.

Provincial and territorial legislatures have no second chamber like the Canadian Senate. Originally, most provinces had such bodies, known as legislative councils, with members titled councillors. These upper houses were abolished one by one, Quebec&#x27;s being the last in 1968. In most provinces, the single house of the legislature is known as the Legislative Assembly; the exceptions are Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, where the chamber is called the House of Assembly, and Quebec where it is called the National Assembly. Ontario has a legislative assembly but its members are called members of the Provincial Parliament or MPPs. The legislative assemblies use a procedure similar to that of the House of Commons of Canada. The head of government of each province, called the premier, is generally the head of the party with the most seats. This is also the case in Yukon, but the Northwest Territories and Nunavut have no political parties at the territorial level. The King&#x27;s representative in each province is the lieutenant governor. In each of the territories there is an analogous commissioner, but they represent the federal government rather than the monarch.

==Provincial political parties==
Most provinces have rough provincial counterparts to major federal parties. However, these provincial parties are not usually formally linked to the federal parties that share the same name. For example, no provincial Conservative or Progressive Conservative Party shares an organizational link to the federal Conservative Party of Canada, and neither do provincial Green Parties to the Green Party of Canada.

Provincial New Democratic Parties, on the other hand, are fully integrated with the federal New Democratic Party—meaning that provincial parties effectively operate as sections, with common membership, of the federal party.

The Liberal Party of Canada shares such an organizational integration with Atlantic Canada provincial Liberals in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. Other provincial Liberal parties are unaffiliated with their federal counterpart.

Some provinces have provincial political parties with no clear federal equivalent, such as the Alberta Party and Saskatchewan Party.

The provincial political climate of Quebec is different: the main split is between sovereignty, represented by the Parti Québécois and Québec solidaire, and federalism, represented primarily by the Quebec Liberal Party. The , meanwhile, takes an abstentionist position on the question and does not support or oppose sovereignty.

Currently, the one minority provincial/territorial government is held by the Liberals in Yukon. They are in government with a formal confidence and supply agreement from the Yukon New Democratic Party.

==Ceremonial territory==
The Canadian National Vimy Memorial, near Vimy, Pas-de-Calais, and the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial, near Beaumont-Hamel, both in France, are ceremonially considered Canadian territory. In 1922, the French government donated the land used for the Vimy Memorial &quot;freely, and for all time, to the Government of Canada the free use of the land exempt from all taxes&quot;. The site of the Somme battlefield near Beaumont-Hamel site was purchased in 1921 by the people of the Dominion of Newfoundland. These sites do not, however, enjoy extraterritorial status and are thus subject to French law.

==Proposed provinces and territories==

Since Confederation in 1867, there have been several proposals for new Canadian provinces and territories. The Constitution of Canada requires an amendment for the creation of a new province but the creation of a new territory requires only an act of Parliament, a legislatively simpler process.

In late 2004, Prime Minister Paul Martin surprised some observers by expressing his personal support for all three territories gaining provincial status &quot;eventually&quot;. He cited their importance to the country as a whole and the ongoing need to assert sovereignty in the Arctic, particularly as global warming could make that region more open to exploitation leading to more complex international waters disputes.

<doc id="75773" wikidata="Q181427" url="?curid=75773" title="Palenque">
<text>Palenque (; Yucatec Maya: ), also anciently known in the Itza Language as Lakamha (&quot;big water&quot; or &quot;big waters&quot;), was a Maya city-state in southern Mexico that perished in the 8th century. The Palenque ruins date from ca. 226 BC to ca. 799 AD. After its decline, it was overgrown by the jungle of cedar, mahogany, and sapodilla trees, but has since been excavated and restored. It is located near the Usumacinta River in the Mexican state of Chiapas, about south of Ciudad del Carmen, above sea level. It is adjacent to the modern town of Palenque, Chiapas. It averages a humid with roughly of rain a year.

Palenque is a medium-sized site, smaller than Tikal, Chichen Itza, or Copán, but it contains some of the finest architecture, sculpture, roof comb and bas-relief carvings that the Mayas produced. Much of the history of Palenque has been reconstructed from reading the hieroglyphic inscriptions on the many monuments; historians now have a long sequence of the ruling dynasty of Palenque in the 5th century and extensive knowledge of the city-state&#x27;s rivalry with other states such as Calakmul and Toniná. The most famous ruler of Palenque was Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal, or Pacal the Great, whose tomb has been found and excavated in the Temple of the Inscriptions. By 2005, the discovered area covered up to , but it is estimated that less than 10% of the total area of the city is explored, leaving more than a thousand structures still covered by jungle. Palenque received 920,470 visitors in 2017.

==History==
Mythological beings using a variety of emblem glyphs in their titles suggests a complex early history. For instance, Kʼukʼ Bahlam I, the supposed founder of the Palenque dynasty, is called a &quot;Toktan Ajaw&quot; in the text of the Temple of the Foliated Cross.

The famous structures that we know today probably represent a rebuilding effort in response to the attacks by the city of Calakmul and its client states in 599 and 611. One of the main figures responsible for rebuilding Palenque and for a renaissance in the city&#x27;s art and architecture is also one of the best-known Maya &quot;Ajaw&quot;, Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal (Pacal the Great), who ruled from 615 to 683. He is known through his funerary monument dubbed the Temple of the Inscriptions, after the lengthy text preserved in the temple&#x27;s superstructure. At the time Alberto Ruz Lhuillier excavated Pakal&#x27;s tomb, it was the richest and best preserved of any scientifically excavated burial then known from the ancient Americas. It held this position until the discovery of the rich Moche burials at Sipán, Peru and the recent discoveries at Copán and Calakmul.
Beside the attention that Kʼinich Janaab&#x27; Pakal&#x27;s tomb brought to Palenque, the city is historically significant for its extensive hieroglyphic corpus composed during the reigns of Janaabʼ Pakal, his son Kʼinich Kan Bahlam II, and his grandson Kʼinich Akal Moʼ Naabʼ, and for being the location where Heinrich Berlin and later Linda Schele and Peter Mathews outlined the first dynastic list for any Maya city. The work of Tatiana Proskouriakoff as well as that of Berlin, Schele, Mathews, and others, initiated the intense historical investigations that characterized much of the scholarship on the ancient Maya from the 1960s to the present. The extensive iconography and textual corpus has also allowed for study of Classic period Maya mythology and ritual practice.

===Rulers===
A list of possible and known Maya rulers of the city, with dates of their reigns:


===Early Classic period===
The first &quot;ajaw&quot;, or king, of Bʼaakal that we know of was Kʼuk Balam (Quetzal Jaguar), who governed for four years starting in the year 431. After him, a king came to power, nicknamed &quot;Casper&quot; by archaeologists. The next two kings were probably &quot;Casper&quot;&#x27;s sons. Little was known about the first of these, Bʼutz Aj Sak Chiik, until 1994, when a tablet was found describing a ritual for the king. The first tablet mentioned his successor Ahkal Moʼ Naab I as a teenage prince, and therefore it is believed that there was a family relation between them. For unknown reasons, Akhal Moʼ Naab I had great prestige, so the kings who succeeded him were proud to be his descendants.

When Ahkal Moʼ Naab I died in 524, there was an interregnum of four years, before the following king was crowned at Toktán in 529. Kʼan Joy Chitam I governed for 36 years. His sons Ahkal Moʼ Naab II and Kʼan Bʼalam I were the first kings who used the title &quot;Kinich&quot;, which means &quot;the great sun&quot;. This word was used also by later kings. Bʼalam was succeeded in 583 by Yohl Ikʼnal, who was supposedly his daughter. The inscriptions found in Palenque document a battle that occurred under her government in which troops from Calakmul invaded and sacked Palenque, a military feat without known precedents. These events took place in 599.

A second victory by Calakmul occurred some twelve years later, in 611, under the government of Aj Ne&#x27; Yohl Mat, son of Yohl Iknal. In this occasion, the king of Calakmul entered Palenque in person, consolidating a significant military disaster, which was followed by an epoch of political disorder. Aj Ne&#x27; Yohl Mat was to die in 612.

===Late Classic period===

Bʼaakal began the Late Classic period in the throes of the disorder created by the defeats before Calakmul. The glyphic panels at the Temple of the Inscriptions, which records the events at this time, relates that some fundamental annual religious ceremonies were not performed in 613, and at this point states: &quot;Lost is the divine lady, lost is the king.&quot; Mentions of the government at the time have not been found.

It is believed that after the death of Aj Ne&#x27; Yohl Mat, Janaab Pakal, also called Pakal I, took power thanks to a political agreement. Janaab Pakal assumed the functions of the &quot;ajaw&quot; (king) but never was crowned. He was succeeded in 612 by his daughter, the queen Sak Kʼukʼ, who governed for only three years until her son was old enough to rule. It is considered that the dynasty was reestablished from then on, so Bʼaakal retook the path of glory and splendor.
The grandson of Janaab Pakal is the most famous of the Mayan kings, Kʼinich Janaab&#x27; Pakal, also known as Pakal the Great. He began rule at the age of 12 years after his mother Sak Kuk resigned as queen after three years, thus passing power on to him. Pakal the Great reigned in Palenque from 615 to 683, and his mother remained an important force for the first 25 years of his rule. She may have ruled jointly with him. Known as the favorite of the gods, he carried Palenque to new levels of splendor, in spite of having come to power when the city was at a low point. Pakal married the princess of Oktán, Lady Tzakbu Ajaw (also known as Ahpo-Hel) in 624 and had at least three children.
Most of the palaces and temples of Palenque were constructed during his government; the city flourished as never before, eclipsing Tikal. The central complex, known as The Palace, was enlarged and remodeled on various occasions, notably in the years 654, 661, and 668. In this structure, is a text describing how in that epoch Palenque was newly allied with Tikal, and also with Yaxchilan, and that they were able to capture the six enemy kings of the alliance. Not much more had been translated from the text.
After the death of Pakal in 683, his older son Kʼinich Kan Bʼalam assumed the kingship of Bʼaakal, who in turn was succeeded in 702 by his brother Kʼinich Kʼan Joy Chitam II. The first continued the architectural and sculptural works that were begun by his father, as well as finishing the construction of the famous tomb of Pakal. Pakal&#x27;s sarcophagus, built for a very tall man, held the richest collection of jade seen in a Mayan tomb. A jade mosaic mask was placed over his face, and a suit made of jade adorned his body, with each piece hand-carved and held together by gold wire.

Furthermore, Kʼinich Kan Bʼalam I began ambitious projects, including the Group of the Crosses. Thanks to numerous works begun during his government, now we have portraits of this king, found in various sculptures. His brother succeeded him continuing construction and art with the same enthusiasm, reconstructing and enlarging the north side of the Palace. Thanks to the reign of these three kings, Bʼaakal had a century of growth and splendor.
In 711, Palenque was sacked by the realm of Toniná, and the old king Kʼinich Kʼan Joy Chitam II was taken prisoner. It is not known what the final fate of the king was, and it is presumed that he was executed in Toniná. For 10 years there was no king. Finally, Kʼinich Ahkal Moʼ Nab&#x27; III was crowned in 722. Although the new king belonged to the royalty, there is no evidence that he was the direct inheritor of Kʼinich Kʼan Joy Chitam II. It is believed, therefore, that this coronation was a break in the dynastic line, and probably Kʼinich Ahkal Nab&#x27; arrived to power after years of maneuvering and forging political alliances. This king, his son, and grandson governed until the end of the 8th century. Little is known about this period, except that, among other events, the war with Toniná continued, where there are hieroglyphics that record a new defeat of Palenque.

Occasionally city-state lords were women. Lady Sak Kuk ruled at Palenque for at least three years starting in 612 CE, before she passed her title to her son. However, these female rulers were accorded male attributes. They were presented as more masculine, since they had assumed roles that were typically held by men.

===Abandonment===
During the 8th century, Bʼaakal came under increasing stress, in concert with most other Classic Mayan city-states, and there was no new elite construction in the ceremonial center sometime after 800. An agricultural population continued to live here for a few generations, then the site was abandoned and was slowly grown over by the forest. The district was very sparsely populated when the Spanish first arrived in the 1520s.

==Art and architecture==
Important structures at Palenque include:

===Temple of the Inscriptions===
The Temple of the Inscriptions had begun perhaps as early as 675 as the funerary monument of Hanab-Pakal. The temple superstructure houses the second longest glyphic text known from the Maya world (the longest is the Hieroglyphic Stairway at Copan). The Temple of the Inscriptions records approximately 180 years of the city&#x27;s history from the 4th through 12th Kʼatun. The focal point of the narrative records Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal&#x27;s Kʼatun period-ending rituals focused on the icons of the city&#x27;s patron deities prosaically known collectively as the Palenque Triad or individually as GI, GII, and GIII.

The pyramid measures 60 meters wide, 42.5 meters deep and 27.2 meters high. The summit temple measures 25.5 meters wide, 10.5 meters deep and 11.4 meters high. The largest stones weigh 12 to 15 tons. These were on top of the pyramid. The total volume of pyramid and temple is 32,500 cu. meters.

In 1952 Alberto Ruz Lhuillier removed a stone slab in the floor of the back room of the temple superstructure to reveal a passageway (filled in shortly before the city&#x27;s abandonment and reopened by archeologists) leading through a long stairway to Pakal&#x27;s tomb. The tomb itself is remarkable for its large carved sarcophagus, the rich ornaments accompanying Pakal, and for the stucco sculpture decorating the walls of the tomb. Unique to Pakal&#x27;s tomb is the psychoduct, which leads from the tomb itself, up the stairway and through a hole in the stone covering the entrance to the burial. This psychoduct is perhaps a physical reference to concepts about the departure of the soul at the time of death in Maya eschatology where in the inscriptions the phrase &quot;ochb&#x27;ihaj sak ikʼil&quot; (the white breath road-entered) is used to refer to the leaving of the soul. A find such as this is greatly important because it demonstrated for the first time the temple usage as being multifaceted. These pyramids were, for the first time, identified as temples and also funerary structures.
The much-discussed iconography of the sarcophagus lid depicts Pakal in the guise of one of the manifestations of the Maya maize god emerging from the maws of the underworld.

The temple also has a duct structure that still is not completely understood by archaeologists. It has been suggested that the duct aligns with the winter solstice and that the sun shines down on Pakal&#x27;s tomb.

===Temples of the Cross group===

The Temple of the Cross, Temple of the Sun, and Temple of the Foliated Cross are a set of graceful temples atop step pyramids, each with an elaborately carved relief in the inner chamber depicting two figures presenting ritual objects and effigies to a central icon. Earlier interpretations had argued that the smaller figure was that of Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal while the larger figure was Kʼinich Kan Bʼahlam. However, it is now known based on a better understanding of the iconography and epigraphy that the central tablet depicts two images of Kan Bʼahlam. The smaller figure shows Kʼinich Kan Bʼahlam during a rite of passage ritual at the age of six (9.10.8.9.3 9 Akbal 6 Xul) while the larger is of his accession to kingship at the age of 48. These temples were named by early explorers; the cross-like images in two of the reliefs actually depict the tree of creation at the center of the world in Maya mythology.

===Palace===

The Palace, a complex of several connected and adjacent buildings and courtyards, was built by several generations on a wide artificial terrace during four century period. The Palace was used by the Mayan aristocracy for bureaucratic functions, entertainment, and ritualistic ceremonies. The Palace is located in the center of the ancient city.
Within the Palace there are numerous sculptures and bas-relief carvings that have been conserved. The Palace most unusual and recognizable feature is the four-story tower known as The Observation Tower. The Observation Tower like many other buildings at the site exhibit a mansard-like roof. The A-shaped corbel arch is an architectural motif observed throughout the complex. The Corbel arches require a large amount of masonry mass and are limited to a small dimensional ratio of width to height providing the characteristic high ceilings and narrow passageways. The Palace was equipped with numerous large baths and saunas which were supplied with fresh water by an intricate water system. An aqueduct, constructed of great stone blocks with a three-meter-high vault, diverts the Otulum River to flow underneath the main plaza. The Palace is the largest building complex in Palenque measuring 97 meters by 73 meters at its base.

===Other notable buildings===

* The Temple of the Skull has a skull on one of the pillars.
* Temple XIII contained the Tomb of the Red Queen, an unknown noble woman, possibly the wife of Pakal, discovered in 1994. The remains in the sarcophagus were completely covered with a bright red powder made of cinnabar.
* The Temple of The Jaguar (a.k.a. The Temple of the Beautiful Relief) at a distance of some 200 meters south of the main group of temples; its name came from the elaborate bas-relief carving of a king seated on a throne in the form of a jaguar.
* Structure XII with a bas-relief carving of the God of Death.
* Temple of the Count another elegant Classic Palenque temple, which got its name from the fact that early explorer Jean-Frédéric Waldeck lived in the building for some time, and Waldeck claimed to be a count.

The site also has a number of other temples, tombs, and elite residences, some a good distance from the center of the site, a court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame, and an interesting stone bridge over the Otulum River some distance below the Aqueduct.

==Modern investigations==
After de la Nada&#x27;s brief account of the ruins, no attention was paid to them until 1773 when one Don Ramon de Ordoñez y Aguilar examined Palenque and sent a report to the Capitan General in Antigua Guatemala, a further examination was made in 1784 saying that the ruins were of particular interest, so two years later surveyor and architect Antonio Bernasconi was sent with a small military force under Colonel Antonio del Río to examine the site in more detail. Del Rio&#x27;s forces smashed through several walls to see what could be found, doing a fair amount of damage to the Palace, while Bernasconi made the first map of the site as well as drawing copies of a few of the bas-relief figures and sculptures. Draughtsman Luciano Castañeda made more drawings in 1807, and a book on Palenque, &quot;Descriptions of the Ruins of an Ancient City, discovered near Palenque&quot;, was published in London in 1822 based on the reports of those last two expeditions together with engravings based on Bernasconi and Castañedas drawings; two more publications in 1834 contained descriptions and drawings based on the same sources.

Juan Galindo visited Palenque in 1831, and filed a report with the Central American government. He was the first to note that the figures depicted in Palenque&#x27;s ancient art looked like the local Native Americans; some other early explorers, even years later, attributed the site to such distant peoples as Egyptians, Polynesians, or the Lost Tribes of Israel.

Starting in 1832 Jean-Frédéric Waldeck spent two years at Palenque making numerous drawings, but most of his work was not published until 1866. Meanwhile, the site was visited in 1840 first by Patrick Walker and Herbert Caddy on a mission from the governor of British Honduras, and then by John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood who published an illustrated account the following year which was greatly superior to the previous accounts of the ruins.

Désiré Charnay took the first photographs of Palenque in 1858, and returned in 1881–1882. Alfred Maudslay encamped at the ruins in 1890–1891 and took extensive photographs of all the art and inscriptions he could find, and made paper and plaster molds of many of the inscriptions, and detailed maps and drawings, setting a high standard for all future investigators to follow. Maudslay learned the technique of making the papier mache molds of the sculptures from Frenchman Desire Charnay.

Several other expeditions visited the ruins before Frans Blom of Tulane University in 1923, who made superior maps of both the main site and various previously neglected outlying ruins and filed a report for the Mexican government on recommendations on work that could be done to preserve the ruins.

From 1949 through 1952 Alberto Ruz Lhuillier supervised excavations and consolidations of the site for Mexico&#x27;s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH); it was Ruz Lhuillier who was the first person to gaze upon Pacal the Great&#x27;s tomb in over a thousand years. Ruz worked for four years at the Temple of the Inscriptions before unearthing the tomb. Further INAH work was done in lead by Jorge Acosta into the 1970s.

In 1973, the first of the very productive Palenque &quot;Mesa Redonda&quot; (Round table) conferences was held here on the inspiration of Merle Greene Robertson; thereafter every few years leading Mayanists would meet at Palenque to discuss and examine new findings in the field. Meanwhile, Robertson was conducting a detailed examination of all art at Palenque, including recording all the traces of color on the sculptures.

The 1970s also saw a small museum built at the site.

In the last 15 or 20 years, a great deal more of the site has been excavated, but currently archaeologists estimate that only 5% of the total city has been uncovered.

In 2010, Pennsylvania State University researchers, Christopher Duffy and Kirk French, identified the Piedras Bolas Aqueduct as a pressurised aqueduct, the earliest known in the New World. It is a spring-fed conduit located on steep terrain that has a restricted outlet that would cause the water to exit forcefully, under pressure, to a height of . They were unable to identify the use for this man-made feature.

In June 2022, archaeologists from the Mexico&#x27;s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) announced the discovery of a 1,300-year-old nine-inch-tall stucco head statue in a pond, believed to be a young Hun Hunahpu, the Maya&#x27;s mythological maize god. The figure&#x27;s semi-shaved haircut that resembles ripe corn was the reason they identified it as a young maize god. Researchers assume that the Mayan inhabitants of Palenque possibly placed a large stone statuette over a pond to represent the entrance to the underworld. According to archaeologist Arnoldo González Cruz, the Mayan people symbolically shuttered the pool by breaking up some of the stucco and filling it with animal remains, including pottery fragments, carved bone remains, shells, obsidian arrowheads, beads, vegetables, and other items.

== Paleontological significance ==
Research inside the temples of Palenque has revealed the presence of numerous extremely well-preserved fossils of marine fish and invertebrates in the limestone slabs used to build the temples, as well as in the former quarries that this limestone was mined in. The existence of these fossils was known since the 19th century, but they only received significant scientific and archeological attention since the 2000s. These fossils have been dated to the Tenejapa-Lacandón Formation of the Early Paleocene, shortly after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, and document the recovery of marine ecosystems following the extinction, including the development of modern coral reefs. Fossils include some of the earliest representatives of modern reef fish, such as serranids (&quot;Paleoserranus&quot;), damselfish (&quot;Chaychanus&quot;), and syngnathiforms (&quot;Eekaulostomus&quot;), in addition to some of the last members of extinct groups such as pycnodontids. This diverse ecosystem existed despite the area being relatively close to the impact site of the Chixculub meteor, which caused the extinction in the first place. The Mayan residents of the area appear to have been well aware of these fossils and actively collected them, including by using fossil shark teeth and ray spines from the nearby Miocene Tulijá Formation as cutting tools, painting some of the fish skeletons, and cutting the slabs to display the fossils better, making them among the earliest known paleontologists.

==Palenque National Park==
&quot;&#x27;Palenque National Parkʼ&quot; was designated in 1981 by the Mexican government. It covers an area of 17.72 km2, which encompasses the ancient city and the hills to the south. The park includes a family camp site.

<text>Kuro5hin (K5; read &quot;corrosion&quot;) was a collaborative discussion website founded by Rusty Foster in 1999, having been inspired by Slashdot. Articles were created and submitted by users and submitted to a queue for evaluation. Site members could vote for or against publishing an article and once the article had reached a certain number of votes, it was published to the site or deleted from the queue. The site has been described as &quot;a free-for-all of news and opinion written by readers&quot;. Around 2005, its membership numbered in the tens of thousands.

On May 1, 2016, the site was closed down permanently with all content taken offline. Foster stated at the time that it might return in the form of a static archive at a later date.

==Overview==
All content was generated and selected by the users themselves, with the exception of site news written by the administrators. Registered users would submit stories to the &quot;submissions queue&quot; where other users would vote +1 FP (&quot;front page&quot;), +1, 0, or −1. If the story reached a predetermined threshold score, it was posted to the front page or to the relevant section, depending on the proportion of &quot;FP votes&quot;. If it failed to make the threshold, other factors (such as number of comments, type of comments, and their ratings) could still cause the story to be posted to a section or to the front page. Otherwise, it was dropped.

One feature of the story queue was &quot;edit mode&quot;, in which a story was protected from voting for a period of time during which the author could make changes. Comments could still be made on the story to suggest changes before voting began. These comments were distinguished as being &quot;editorial&quot; or &quot;topical&quot;.

A further section was known as the &quot;diaries&quot;. Having no editing or moderation vetting, diaries were essentially weblogs. and formed the source of most of Kuro5hin&#x27;s content by volume. However, unlike the edited article sections, they were not widely syndicated. Other users would also comment on these diaries in the same way as stories but without the editorial or topical stipulation.

==History==

Foster named Kuro5hin—pronounced &quot;corrosion&quot;—as a pun on his first name. The site was powered by the Scoop collaborative system, originally written by Foster himself, with the motto &quot;Technology and Culture, from the Trenches&quot;.

In July 2000, the site was temporarily closed due to comment spam and denial-of-service attacks.

In January 2002, OSDN ended the advertising affiliate agreement with Kuro5hin.

<text>Party games are games that are played at social gatherings to facilitate interaction and provide entertainment and recreation. Categories include (explicit) icebreaker, parlour (indoor), picnic (outdoor), and large group games. Other types include pairing off (partnered) games, and parlour races. Different games will generate different atmospheres so the party game may merely be intended as an icebreakers, or the sole purpose for or structure of the party. As such, party games aim to include players of various skill levels and player-elimination is rare. Party games are intended to be played socially, and are designed to be easy for new players to learn.

==Characteristics==
The characteristics of party games tend to include:
* A game can support a relatively large or undefined number of players, compared to more traditional board games or card games that require a small, set number of players. Some games, especially commercial games, have a set limit based on available equipment; others are limited by other mechanics of the game like time for each turn, while still others have no practical limit, like Appyshot App.
* Team-based play in party games is common, but not required. Games that divide players into two, three, or four roughly equal teams, such as &quot;Cranium&quot;, Charades or &quot;Pictionary&quot; tend to allow for larger total numbers of players. By contrast, other games such as Werewolf and &quot;How to Host a Murder&quot; are role-based, with each player being given a character or other role to play in the course of the game. The number of players is limited to the number of roles, but in many such games there are &quot;generic&quot; roles allowing for a high degree of flexibility.
* Cooperation and interaction between players is encouraged. Both team and role-based play generally encourage this social aspect to the game; games that do not encourage this interaction generally make poor party games.
* Multiple ways to play and contribute. For example, in &quot;Fictionary&quot; not everyone needs to create plausible dictionary definitions; humorous submissions are welcome. In Charades, players can actively participate in guessing without taking a turn at acting. Sports often make poor party games as limitations in a player&#x27;s physical abilities may preclude participation though some party games, such as: relay racing and Red light/Green light, involve a significant physical aspect and are especially suitable for groups similar in age and ability.
* Players participate in gameplay frequently, sometimes on an impromptu basis. Games in which each player has their own independent turn generally make poor party games, especially if a turn takes a long time.
* A game should also have entertainment value for spectators. Many party games involve at least some level of humor, whether inherent in the game or introduced by players. In this way, players not taking a turn can still enjoy the gameplay, whilst party favors can embellish the party atmosphere.
* Player elimination is rare. &quot;Monopoly&quot; makes a poor party game, because bankrupt players must sit out while the remaining players continue to the game&#x27;s conclusion, which can take several hours. In contrast, no matter how far behind a team is in &quot;Pictionary&quot;, all players can participate until the end.
* The amount of specialized equipment needed is not dependent on the number of players. Games such as Liar&#x27;s Dice make poor party games because each player needs a cup and five dice to start the game. By contrast, &quot;Yahtzee&quot; needs only one cup and set of dice regardless of the number of players (the basic Yahtzee game does have other practical limitations).
* The game usually does not involve spending real money as a prerequisite or consequence of playing. Games that require each player to purchase consumable items or specialized equipment are usually poor party games. Casino games are a notable exception. Examples include &quot;casino nights&quot; with a token door charge or buy-in for charity or to defray costs and poker tournaments with a similar small buy-in.

==Video games==

Party video games are commonly designed as a collection of simple minigames, designed to be intuitive and easy to control, and allow for competition between many players. Some games are played on simulated game boards, like the &quot;Itadaki Street&quot; series, &quot;Mario Party&quot; series and &quot;Sonic Shuffle&quot;.

&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1981 called the Olympic sports game &quot;Olympic Decathlon&quot; (1980) &quot;the first true party game for microcomputers&quot;. Another early example is Starpath&#x27;s &quot;Party Mix&quot;. 

Modern examples include &quot;Tower Unite&quot; (2016), a virtual community party game played online, and &quot;The Jackbox Party Pack&quot; series which offers minigames that can be played both online and with people in the same room. 

==Large group games==

Large group games are played by many participants and are often used as planned activities in structured environments, especially as educational activities. They are similar to party games, except that large group games are typically planned for larger numbers (perhaps even hundreds) as part of an event.

Large group games can take a variety of forms and formats.

Some are physical games such as Buck buck.

Some are modeled on the TV game show format, offering points for teams who can answer questions the fastest. Trivia-type games might have questions posed from the stage and each tabletop writing their answers to be collected and scored. Others may take on some of the qualities of Open Space environments and allow participants to wander in a less structured way.

Some are modeled on TV reality shows such as &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; or &quot;Survivor&quot;. Participants compete as individuals or in teams to complete challenges that move them towards victory in a competition spanning the entire party. The TV shows on which such parties are based are normally competitions involving elimination, so such events require significant planning to avoid exclusion or boredom.

There are also now electronic party games such as Cards Against Humanity or Appyshot App that can be played on the phone or computer.

Group board games can take on the design of small groups of players, seated at tables of 4 to 6 people, who work together on a problem. There can be large numbers of people (and thus many tables). If properly designed, these scalable exercises can be used for small groups (12 to 20 people) as well as very large events (600 people or 100 tables).

Generally, for these larger exercises, multimedia projectors, large screens and microphones are required for instructions and communications.

A search for team building events can turn up millions of links to exercises, companies, and various offerings ranging from paintball competitions to fire walks to outdoor climbing or whitewater adventures. The impact on actual team building can vary widely - a golf outing for corporate executives does not generally accomplish much in the way of organizational improvement while a business simulation might be directly focused on linking the play of the game to issues for corporate improvement.

Holiday groups use a gift exchange party game such as white elephant gift exchange for socializing and sharing gifts. New online party games, based on these holiday games, allow larger groups to gather on the internet to save travel expenses.

<text>, better known by the pen name Suihō Tagawa (田河 水泡, &quot;Tagawa Suihō&quot;), was a Japanese manga artist.

==Biography==
Born in Sumida, Tokyo, Nakatarō Takamizawa grew up an orphan: his mother died upon his birth, his father and his uncle (who served as one of his stepparents) both died several years afterwards. He graduated from Fukagawa&#x27;s municipal &quot;Rinkai Jinjō&quot; elementary school in 1911. In 1919, he was conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army, serving in Korea and Manchuria, and left in 1922. In 1925, he graduated from &quot;Nihon Bijutsu Gakkō&quot; (&quot;Japan School of Art&quot;); during his time at the school, he participated in the radical avant-garde movement Mavo, under the pen name Takamizawa Michinao . 

In 1926, he became a &quot;rakugo&quot; author. He began producing manga in 1927. He gained a regular assignment selling manga stories and adopted the pen name , which was later corrupted into : literally means &quot;water bubble&quot;. In 1928 he married (younger sister of Hideo Kobayashi) in a church ceremony.

In 1931, he began the long-running series &quot;Norakuro&quot; in Kodansha&#x27;s anthology magazine &quot;Shōnen Kurabu&quot;, about an anthropomorphic black and white dog in an army of dogs. Although at first intended to have only a brief lifespan, its immense popularity urged Tagawa to continue producing the strip until 1941&quot;.&quot; Tagawa has won numerous awards and is recognized as one of the pioneers of the Japanese manga industry. He mentored Machiko Hasegawa, who would become the creator of the popular comic series Sazae-san, and he was an influence to Osamu Tezuka, the &quot;God of Manga&quot;. Some other comics by Tagawa are &quot;Tako no Yacchan&quot; and &quot;Gasorin Oyoshi&quot;

After World War II he became a &quot;bona fide&quot; Christian; he credited the faith in helping him overcome alcoholism after several failed attempts. In 1988, he produced the autobiographical &quot;Watashi no Rirekisho&quot; (&quot;My Résumé&quot;) for the Japanese &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; newspaper. He died in 1989 at the age of 90.

<text>Bernard Albert Wrightson (October 27, 1948 – March 18, 2017) was an American artist, known for co-creating the Swamp Thing, his adaptation of the novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; illustration work, and for his other horror comics and illustrations, which feature his trademark intricate pen and brushwork.

Wrightson began his career as an illustrator for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; newspaper in 1966. In 1968, he was hired by DC Comics and was a regular artist on the &quot;House of Mystery&quot; and &quot;House of Secrets&quot; horror titles. Wrightson and writer Len Wein created Swamp Thing in &quot;House of Secrets&quot; #92 (July 1971). The character soon received its own monthly series, for which Wrightson drew the first ten issues.

In 1974, Wrightson began working for Warren Publishing magazines. Wrightson illustrated adaptions of works by well-known horror writers, including &quot;The Black Cat&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe and &quot;Cool Air&quot; by H. P. Lovecraft. He drew comic book adaptations of Stephen King&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Creepshow&quot; in 1982, which led to several more collaborations with King. Wrightson spent several years creating an illustrated edition of Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, which was released in 1983. Later in his career, Wrightson provided concept art for various films and television series.

==Early life==
Wrightson was born October 27, 1948, in Dundalk, Maryland. He received training in art from watching Jon Gnagy on television, reading comics, particularly those of EC, as well as through a correspondence course from the Famous Artists School. His artistic influences were Frank Frazetta, Al Williamson, Al Dorne, Graham Ingels, Jack Davis and Howard Pyle. He published a piece of fan art, containing a headstone bearing the inscription &quot;Berni Wrightson, Dec. 15, 1965&quot;, on page 33 of Warren Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Creepy&quot; #9 (cover-dated June 1966).

==Career==
In 1966, Wrightson began working for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; newspaper as an illustrator. The following year, after meeting artist Frank Frazetta at a comic-book convention in New York City, he was inspired to produce his own stories. In 1968, he showed copies of his sequential art to DC Comics editor Dick Giordano and was given a freelance assignment. Wrightson began spelling his name &quot;Berni&quot; in his professional work to distinguish himself from an Olympic diver named Bernie Wrightson, but later restored the final &quot;e&quot; to his name.

In 1968, he drew his first professional comic book story, &quot;The Man Who Murdered Himself&quot;, which appeared in &quot;House of Mystery&quot; #179 (cover-dated March–April 1969). He continued to work on a variety of mystery and anthology titles for both DC and, a few years later, its principal rival, Marvel Comics. It was for Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Chamber of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Tower of Shadows&quot; titles where he was first encouraged to slightly simplify his intricate pen-and-ink drawing, and where his lush brushwork, a hallmark of his comics inking in the 1970s, was first evidenced.

Like many artists in the 1970s and 1980s, Wrightson moved to New York in hopes of finding work with comics publishers. At one point Wrightson lived in the same Queens apartment building as artists Allen Milgrom, Howard Chaykin and Walter Simonson. Simonson recalls, &quot;We&#x27;d get together at 3 a.m. They&#x27;d come up and we&#x27;d have popcorn and sit around and talk about whatever a 26, 27 and 20-year-old guys talk about. Our art, TV, you name it. I pretty much knew at the time, &#x27;These are the good ole days.&#x27;&quot;

===Swamp Thing===

With writer Len Wein, Wrightson co-created the muck creature Swamp Thing in &quot;House of Secrets&quot; #92 (July 1971) in a standalone horror story set in the Victorian era. Wein later recounted how Wrightson became involved with the story: &quot;Bernie Wrightson had just broken up with a girlfriend, and we were sitting in my car just talking about life – all the important things to do when you&#x27;re 19 and 20 years old. [&quot;Laughs&quot;] And I said, &#x27;You know, I just wrote a story that actually kind of feels like the way you feel now.&#x27; I told him about Swamp Thing, and he said, &#x27;I gotta draw that.&#x27;&quot;

In summer 1972, Wrightson published &quot;Badtime Stories&quot;, a horror/science fiction comics anthology featuring his own scripts and artwork (from the period 1970–1971), each story being drawn in a different medium, including ink wash, tonal pencil drawings, duoshade paper, and screen tones, along with traditional pen-and-ink and brushwork. He and writer Marv Wolfman co-created Destiny in &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot; #1 (July–Aug. 1972), a character which would later be used in the work of Neil Gaiman.

In the fall of 1972, the Swamp Thing returned in his own series, set in the contemporary world and in the general DC continuity. Wrightson drew the first ten issues of the series. Abigail Arcane, a major supporting character in the Swamp Thing mythos was introduced by Wrightson and Wein in issue #3 (Feb.-March 1973).

Wrightson had originally been asked by DC to handle the art for its revival of The Shadow, but he left the project early on when he realized he could not produce the necessary minimum number of pages on time, along with his work on &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;. Michael Kaluta illustrated the series, but Wrightson did contribute much to the third issue in both pencils and inks, as well as inking the splash page of issue #4.

===Warren and The Studio===
In the summer of 1973, Wrightson saw the Tod Browning horror film &quot;Freaks&quot; for the first time; in the years immediately afterward, the film influenced much of Wrightson&#x27;s creative output.

In January 1974, Wrightson left DC to work at Warren Publishing, for whose black-and-white horror-comics magazines he produced a series of original work as well as short story adaptations. As with &quot;BadTime Stories&quot;, Wrightson experimented with different media in these black-and-white tales: Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Black Cat&quot; featured intricate pen-and-ink work which stood in direct contrast with his brush-dominated &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; panels. &quot;Jenifer&quot;, scripted by Bruce Jones, was atmospherically rendered with gray markers. &quot;The Pepper Lake Monster&quot; was a synthesis of brush and pen-and-ink, whereas H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;Cool Air&quot; was a foray into duotone paper. &quot;Nightfall&quot; was an exercise in ink wash. &quot;Clarice&quot; was also drawn in pen, brush, and ink, and with ink wash.

In 1975, Wrightson joined with fellow artists Jeff Jones, Michael Kaluta, and Barry Windsor-Smith to form The Studio, a shared loft in Manhattan where the group would pursue creative products outside the constraints of comic book commercialism. Though he continued to produce sequential art, Wrightson at this time began producing artwork for numerous posters, prints, calendars, and even a highly detailed coloring book, &quot;The Monsters&quot;. He also drew sporadic comics stories and single illustrations for &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine from 1973 to 1983.

Wrightson spent seven years drawing approximately 50 detailed pen-and-ink illustrations to accompany an edition of Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. The illustrations themselves are not based upon the Boris Karloff or Christopher Lee films, but on the actual book&#x27;s descriptions of characters and objects. Wrightson also used a period style, saying &quot;I wanted the book to look like an antique; to have the feeling of woodcuts or steel engravings, something of that era&quot; and basing the feel on artists like Franklin Booth, J.C. Coll and Edwin Austin Abbey. &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was an unpaid project, Wrightson describing it as a &quot;labor of love&quot; he worked on over seven years.

===Later career===
The &quot;Captain Sternn&quot; segment of the animated film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; is based on a character created by Wrightson (first appearing in the June 1980 issue of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine). The &quot;Freakshow&quot; graphic novel, written by Bruce Jones and illustrated (via pen, brush, and ink with watercolors) by Wrightson, was published in Spain in 1982 and serialized in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine in the early 1980s.

In 1982 Bernie Wrightson illustrated the comic book adaptation of the Stephen King-penned horror film &quot;Creepshow&quot;. This led to several other collaborations with King, including illustrations for the novella &quot;Cycle of the Werewolf&quot;, the restored edition of King&#x27;s apocalyptic horror epic, &quot;The Stand&quot;, and &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot;, the fifth installment of King&#x27;s &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series. He would later illustrate the cover for &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine&#x27;s April 26 – May 2, 1997, issue, illustrating the TV miniseries of King&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot;.

During production on the 1984 film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, Wrightson was among the artists hired by associate producer Michael C. Gross to provide concept art envisioning the ghosts and other psychic phenomena encountered by that film&#x27;s characters. The artwork he contributed included images of the &quot;escapees&quot; from the Ghostbusters&#x27; electrically powered ghost storage facility, which run amok after the facility&#x27;s electricity is turned off.
Jim Starlin and Wrightson produced &quot;Heroes for Hope&quot;, a 1985 one-shot designed to raise money for African famine relief and recovery. Published in the form of a &quot;comic jam&quot;, the book featured an all-star lineup of comics creators as well as a few notable authors from outside the comic book industry, such as Stephen King, George R. R. Martin, Harlan Ellison, and Edward Bryant. In 1986, Wrightson and writer Susan K. Putney collaborated on the &quot;Spider-Man: Hooky&quot; graphic novel. That same year saw Wrightson and Starlin produce a second benefit comic, &quot;Heroes Against Hunger&quot; featuring Superman and Batman which was published by DC and like the earlier Marvel project featured many top comics creators. Starlin and Wrightson collaborated on two miniseries in 1988, &quot;The Weird&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #29 (featuring the Hulk and the Thing) and &quot;Punisher P.O.V.&quot; for Marvel.

Wrightson brought back his Captain Sternn character in 1993 for the &quot;Captain Sternn: Running Out of Time&quot; miniseries, published by Kitchen Sink Press. In 1997, Wrightson and Ron Marz collaborated on &quot;Batman/Aliens&quot;, a crossover between the &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot; franchises. Wrightson again worked with Punisher for the &quot;Punisher: Purgatory&quot; limited series from 1998 to 1999. The series was unusual for incorporating supernatural elements in a Punisher story.

He illustrated and contributed album covers for a number of bands and musical artists, including Meat Loaf. Wrightson did concept art for film and television, working on productions including &quot;The Faculty&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;The Mist&quot;, &quot;Land of the Dead&quot;, and &quot;Serenity&quot;. In 2012, Wrightson collaborated with Steve Niles on &quot;Frankenstein Alive, Alive!&quot; published by IDW Publishing, for which he won a National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s award.

==Personal life==
Wrightson&#x27;s first wife Michele Wrightson was involved in underground comix, contributing stories to such publications as &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe&quot;, &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot;, and &quot;Arcade&quot;. She died in 2015. Wrightson and Michelle had two sons together, John and Jeffrey. Wrightson lived with his second wife Liz Wrightson and his stepson Thomas Adamson in Austin, Texas.

Wrightson and his wife announced in January 2017 that he was retiring due to having limited body function after multiple brain surgeries. He died on March 18, 2017, at the age of 68. The next day, Liz Wrightson confirmed that his death followed a long diagnosis with brain cancer. &quot;The First Day of the Rest of Your Life&quot;, the April 2, 2017, season 7 finale of the TV series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, was dedicated to Wrightson&#x27;s memory.

==Creative legacy==
Wrightson&#x27;s death met with a series of testimonials and tributes by colleagues and professional admirers that included Joss Whedon, Neil Gaiman, Guillermo del Toro, Walter Simonson, and Mike Mignola. Whedon called Wrightson &quot;a star by which other pencillers chart their course&quot;, while Gaiman stated that Wrightson was the first comics artist whose work he loved. Horror connoisseur del Toro took a 24-hour pledge of silence in honor of Wrightson, writing, &quot;As it comes to all of us, the end came for the greatest that ever lived: Bernie Wrightson. My North dark star of youth. A master.&quot; Hellboy creator Mike Mignola said of Wrightson, &quot;He was a genius, and not just a monster guy. Everything Bernie did had soul.&quot;

Wrightson&#x27;s former neighbor Walter Simonson, who lived in the same building as Wrightson in the 1980s, recalled, &quot;Even at an early age, we were all really in awe of his work, it was so good.&quot; Analyzing Wrightson&#x27;s skill in depth, Simonson explained that in addition to his ability to draw anything, Wrightson was a master of value, able to effect a precise command over the depth and tones of the colors and shades of gray in his work, stating, &quot;&#x27;Frankenstein&#x27; is a complete masterpiece of value, using incredibly complex pictures, and yet you always see exactly what you are supposed to see. He drives the eye right where it needs.&quot; Regarding the famously reproduced two-page spread from that work depicting Frankenstein&#x27;s laboratory, Simonson said of that image, &quot;It&#x27;s so complicated and yet he&#x27;s able to show you what he wants you to see. In some ways [the lab scene is] the core of the story. It&#x27;s where Frankenstein breaks the laws of God.&quot; Comics analyst and historian Scott McCloud called that image a &quot;riot of detail&quot;, saying, &quot;It might take a moment before you even notice the corpse laying at the bottom of the composition on the left. That makes it a bit more of a treasure map. Bit more of a &#x27;Where Is Waldo?&#x27;&quot;

During a 2016 tour of his extensive library of art and pop culture memorabilia, Del Toro named Wrightson&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; as the work whose original artwork was the hardest to find, saying, &quot;They are very rare. The people that have them don&#x27;t let them go. It&#x27;s taken me years to get that. I have nine out of the 13 favorite plates of the Frankenstein book that Bernie Wrightson ever did. The other four: one of them, no one knows where it is, and the other three are, I would say, very hard to pry away from the people that have them.&quot;

==Awards==
* Wrightson won the Shazam Award for Best Penciller (Dramatic Division) in 1972 and 1973 for Swamp Thing, the Shazam Award for Best Individual Story (Dramatic) in 1972 for &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #1 (with Len Wein). He received additional nominations, including for the Shazam Award for Best Inker in 1973 for &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, as well as that year&#x27;s Shazam for Best Individual Story, for &quot;A Clockwork Horror&quot; in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #6 (with Len Wein).

<text>Pictionary (, ) is a charades-inspired word-guessing game invented by Robert Angel with graphic design by Gary Everson and first published in 1985 by Angel Games Inc. Angel Games licensed Pictionary to Western Publishing. Hasbro purchased the rights in 1994 after acquiring the games business of Western Publishing. Mattel acquired ownership of Pictionary in 2001. The game is played in teams with players trying to identify specific words from their teammates. Its name is a portmanteau of &quot;picture&quot; and &quot;dictionary&quot;.

== History ==
The concept of &quot;Pictionary&quot; was first created by Robert Angel and his friends in 1981. Angel and his roommates came up with the concept of the game, which proved to be very popular between them. While originally hesitant to pitch the idea, Angel was inspired by &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, the gameplay of which was similar to his concept and proved to him that such gameplay could work and be successful.

Angel and his business partners Terry Langston and Gary Everson first published &quot;Pictionary&quot; in 1985 through Angel Games. A week before &quot;Pictionary&quot; was first launched, Angel Games&#x27; printing company called to inform them that they could not sort through the 500,000 cards they had printed out. Angel and his partners had to sort through the cards themselves over the course of six days. They managed to sell 6,000 copies in one year at $35 each.

Angel Games licensed the game in 1986 in a joint venture between The Games Gang and Western Publishing. In 1994, Hasbro took over publishing after acquiring the games business of Western Publishing.

In 2001, &quot;Pictionary&quot; was sold to Mattel. At that time they were in 60 countries and 45 languages, with 11 versions just in the US and a total of 32,000,000 games sold worldwide.

==Objective==
Each team moves a piece on a game board consisting of a sequence of squares. Each square has a letter or shape indicating the type of picture to be drawn. To advance to a new square, a player must guess the word or phrase being drawn by their partner. If a player lands on an &quot;all play&quot; square, one player from each team attempts to illustrate the same concept simultaneously, with both teams racing to guess first. The first team to land on the last square and guess correctly wins.

==Gameplay==

The team chooses one person to begin drawing; this position rotates with each word. The drawer chooses a card out of a deck of special &quot;Pictionary&quot; cards and tries to draw pictures which suggest the word printed on the card. The pictures cannot contain any numbers or letters, nor can the drawers use spoken clues about the subjects they are drawing. The teammates try to guess the word the drawing is intended to represent.

There are five types of squares on the board, and each &quot;Pictionary&quot; card has a list of five words printed on it. Players must then draw the word which corresponds to the square their playing piece landed on:
AP category (and a random selection of check-marked words in other categories) are designated as &quot;All Play&quot;. For &quot;All Play,&quot; the teams compete against each other. Each team designates a player whose purpose will be to draw pictures. The team that guesses the word first gets to advance and take the next turn. If none of the teams guess the word, the turn passes to whichever team should have been next. One may not point or gesture to an object

A one-minute timer, usually a sand timer, is used to compel players to rapidly complete their drawing and guessing.

==Television series==
In 2022 in American television debuted a game show based on the game, entitled simply &quot;Pictionary&quot; hosted by Jerry O&#x27;Connell. In 2024 a British version of the show, hosted by Mel Giedroyc, launched on ITV1.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; included &quot;Pictionary&quot; in its top 100 games of 1986, saying, &quot;The frequent All Play rounds, in which all teams try to identify the same word, are especially exciting. Artistic talent is not a requirement; ingeniously simple drawings almost always win. The 2,500 color-coded words provide real tests of imagination.&quot;

<text>A synod () is a council of a Christian denomination, usually convened to decide an issue of doctrine, administration or application. The word &quot;&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek () ; the term is analogous with the Latin word . Originally, synods were meetings of bishops, and the word is still used in that sense in Catholicism, Oriental Orthodoxy and Eastern Orthodoxy. In modern usage, the word often refers to the governing body of a particular church, whether its members are meeting or not. It is also sometimes used to refer to a church that is governed by a synod.

Sometimes the phrase &quot;general synod&quot; or &quot;general council&quot; refers to an ecumenical council. The word &quot;synod&quot; also refers to the standing council of high-ranking bishops governing some of the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox churches. Similarly, the day-to-day governance of patriarchal and major archiepiscopal Eastern Catholic Churches is entrusted to a permanent synod.

==Usages in different Communions==

===Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox===

In Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches, synods of bishops are meetings of bishops within each autonomous Church and are the primary vehicle for the election of bishops and the establishment of inter-diocesan ecclesiastical laws.

A &quot;sobor&quot; () is a formal gathering or of bishops together with other clerical and lay delegates representing the church to deal with matters of faith, morality, rite, and canonical and cultural life. The synod in the Western churches is similar, but it is distinguished by being usually limited to an assembly of bishops.

The term is found among those Eastern Orthodox Churches that use Slavic languages (the Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian and Macedonian Orthodox Churches), along with the Romanian Orthodox Church.

==== Assembly ====

The presence of clerical and lay delegates is for the purpose of discerning the consensus of the church on important matters; however, the bishops form an upper house of the sobor, and the laity cannot overrule their decisions.

Kievan Rus&#x27; chronicles record the first known East Slavic church sobor as having taken place in Kiev in 1051. Sobors were convened periodically from then on; one notable assembly held in 1415 formed a separate metropoly for the church in the Grand Duchy of Lithuanian lands.

Important sobors in the history of the Russian Orthodox Church are:
* Vladimir&#x27;s Sobor in 1276
* The Stoglavy Sobor (Sobor of a Hundred Chapters) in 1551
* The Moscow Sobor of 1666–1667, to deal with disputes surrounding the ecclesiastical reforms of Patriarch Nikon
* The All-Russian Sobor of 1917, which restored the Moscow Patriarchate and elected Saint Tikhon as the first modern Patriarch of Moscow
* The All-Russian Sobor of 1988, called on the 1000th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus&#x27; to guide the church in the wake of glasnost and the loosening of the Soviet grip over the church

A bishop may also call a sobor for his diocese, which again would have delegates from the clergy, monasteries and parishes of his diocese, to discuss important matters. Such diocesan sobors may be held annually or only occasionally.

===Catholic===

In Roman Catholic usage, &quot;synod&quot; and &quot;council&quot; are theoretically synonymous as they are of Greek and Latin origins, respectively, both meaning an authoritative meeting of bishops for the purpose of church administration in the areas of teaching (faith and morals) or governance (church discipline or law). However, in modern use, synod and council are applied to specific categories of such meetings and so do not really overlap. A synod generally meets every three years and is thus designated an &quot;Ordinary General Assembly&quot;. However, &quot;Extraordinary&quot; synods can be called to deal with specific situations. There are also &quot;Special&quot; synods for the Church in a specific geographic area such as the one held November 16 – December 12, 1997, for the Church in America.

==== Synod of Bishops ====
While the words &quot;synod&quot; and &quot;council&quot; usually refer to a transitory meeting, the term &quot;Synod of Bishops&quot; or &quot;Synod of the Bishops&quot;, is also applied to a permanent body established in 1965 as an advisory body of the pope. It holds assemblies at which bishops and religious superiors, elected by bishops conferences or the Union of Superiors General or appointed by the Pope vote on proposals (&quot;propositiones&quot;) to present for the pope&#x27;s consideration, and which in practice the pope uses as the basis of &quot;post-synodal apostolic exhortations&quot; on the themes discussed. While an assembly of the Synod of Bishops thus expresses its collective wishes, it does not issue decrees, unless in certain cases the pope authorizes it to do so, and even then an assembly&#x27;s decision requires ratification by the pope. The pope serves as president of an assembly or appoints the president, determines the agenda, and summons, suspends, and dissolves the assembly.

Modern Catholic synod themes:
* X &quot;The Bishop: Servant of the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST for the hope of the world&quot; 1998
* XI &quot;The Eucharist: Source and Summit of the Life and Mission of the Church 2005
* XII &quot;The Word of God in the Life and Mission of the Church&quot; 2008
* XIII &quot;New Evangelisation for the Transmission of the Christian Faith&quot; 2012
* Extraordinary General &quot;The Pastoral Challenges of the Family in the Context of Evangelization&quot; 2014

====Councils====

Meetings of bishops in the Roman empire are known from the mid-third century and already numbered twenty by the time of the First Council of Nicaea (325). Thereafter they continued by the hundreds into the sixth century. Those authorized by an emperor and often attended by him came to be called ecumenical, meaning throughout the world (as the world was thought of in Western terms). Today, &quot;Council&quot; in Roman Catholic canon law typically refers to an irregular meeting of the entire episcopate of a nation, region, or the world for the purpose of legislation with binding force. Those contemplated in canon law are the following:
* An &quot;ecumenical council&quot; is an irregular meeting of the entire episcopate in communion with the pope and is, along with the pope, the highest legislative authority of the universal Church (can. 336). The pope alone has the right to convoke, suspend, and dissolve an ecumenical council; he also presides over it or chooses someone else to do so and determines the agenda (can. 338). The vacancy of the Holy See automatically suspends an ecumenical council. Laws or teachings issued by an ecumenical council require the confirmation of the pope, who alone has the right to promulgate them (can. 341). The role of the pope in an ecumenical council is a distinct feature of the Catholic Church.
* &quot;Plenary councils&quot;, which are meetings of the entire episcopate of a nation (including a nation that is only one ecclesiastical province), are convoked by the national episcopal conference.
* &quot;Provincial councils&quot;, which consist of the bishops of an ecclesiastical province smaller than a nation, are convoked by the metropolitan with consent of a majority of the suffragan bishops.

Plenary and provincial councils are categorized as particular councils. A particular council is composed of all the bishops of the territory (including coadjutors and auxiliaries) as well as other ecclesiastical ordinaries who head particular churches in the territory (such as territorial abbots and vicars apostolic). Each of these members has a vote on council legislation. Additionally, the following persons by law are part of particular councils but only participate in an advisory capacity: vicars general and episcopal, presidents of Catholic universities, deans of Catholic departments of theology and canon law, some major superiors elected by all the major superiors in the territory, some rectors of seminaries elected by the rectors of seminaries in the territory, and two members from each cathedral chapter, presbyterial council, or pastoral council in the territory (can. 443). The convoking authority can also select other members of the faithful (including the laity) to participate in the council in an advisory capacity.

Meetings of the entire episcopate of a supra-national region have historically been called councils as well, such as the various Councils of Carthage in which all the bishops of North Africa were to attend.

During the Middle Ages, some councils were legatine, called by a papal legate rather than the pope or bishop.

====Synods====
Synods in Eastern Catholic Churches are similar to synods in Orthodox churches in that they are the primary vehicle for election of bishops and establishment of inter-diocesan ecclesiastical laws. The term &quot;synod&quot; in Latin Church canon law, however, refers to meetings of a representative, thematic, non-legislative (advisory) or mixed nature or in some other way do not meet the qualifications of a &quot;council&quot;. There are various types.

Diocesan synods are irregular meetings of the clergy and laity of a particular church summoned by the diocesan bishop (or other prelate if the particular church is not a diocese) to deliberate on legislative matters. Only the diocesan bishop holds legislative authority; the other members of the diocesan synod act only in an advisory capacity. Those who must be invited to a diocesan synod by law are any coadjutor or auxiliary bishops, the vicars general and episcopal, the &quot;officialis&quot;, the vicars forane plus an additional priest from each vicariate forane, the presbyterial council, canons of the cathedral chapter (if there is one), the rector of the seminary, some of the superiors of religious houses in the diocese, and members of the laity chosen by the diocesan pastoral council, though the diocesan bishop can invite others to attend at his own initiative. (can. 463)

====Episcopal conferences====

National episcopal conferences are another development of the Second Vatican Council. They are permanent bodies consisting of all the Latin Church bishops of a nation and those equivalent to diocesan bishops in law (i.e. territorial abbots). Bishops of other &quot;sui juris&quot; churches and papal nuncios are not members of episcopal conferences by law, though the conference itself may invite them in an advisory or voting capacity (can. 450).

While councils (can. 445) and diocesan synods (can. 391 &amp; 466) have full legislative powers in their areas of competence, national episcopal conferences may only issue supplementary legislation when authorized to do so in canon law or by decree of the Holy See. Additionally, any such supplemental legislation requires a two-thirds vote of the conference and review by the Holy See (can. 455) to have the force of law. Without such authorization and review, episcopal conferences are deliberative only and exercise no authority over their member bishops or dioceses.

=== Anglican ===
In the Anglican Communion, synods are elected by clergy and laity. In most Anglican churches, there is a geographical hierarchy of synods, with &quot;General Synod&quot; at the top; bishops, clergy and laity meet as &quot;houses&quot; within the synod.

&quot;Diocesan synods&quot; are convened by a bishop in his or her diocese, and consist of elected clergy and lay members.

&quot;Deanery synods&quot; are convened by the &quot;Rural Dean&quot; (or &quot;Area Dean&quot;) and consist of all clergy licensed to a benefice within the deanery, plus elected lay members.

===Lutheran===
* In North America, a synod can be a local administrative region similar to a diocese in other denominations. An example of this is the Minneapolis Area Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. However, for some denominations such as the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, it denotes an entire church body. The usage of synod as an administrative ecclesiastical region is also reflected by the German term (i.e. synodal federation), such as the Regional Synodal Federation of the Free City of Danzig.
* In Europe, a synod can be a legislature comprising deputies elected by all enfranchised members of a church and competent for the entire church. It is similar to a general assembly in Presbyterianism, and found, in regional Protestant church bodies (Landeskirche) in Germany; examples include (i.e. regional or land synod) or (general synod). A synod can also be used by an administrative subunit of a church body, such as a city synod (; comprising synodal deputies of congregations of one denomination within one city) or provincial synod (; comprising synodal deputies of congregations within an ecclesiastical province). The use of the term synod to describe a small gathering is now obsolete, the term used instead is &quot;Kirchenkreis&quot;.

===Presbyterian===

In the Presbyterian system of church governance the synod is a level of administration between the local presbytery and the national general assembly. Some denominations use the synod, such as the Presbyterian Church in Canada, Uniting Church in Australia, and the Presbyterian Church USA. However some other churches do not use the synod at all, and the Church of Scotland dissolved its synods in 1993, see List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries. The Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church is considered a Synod since there is no national church in the United States. (see establishment principle)

===Reformed===
In Swiss and southern German Reformed churches, where the Reformed churches are organized as regionally defined independent churches (such as Evangelical Reformed Church of Zurich or Reformed Church of Berne), the synod corresponds to the general assembly of Presbyterian churches. In Reformed churches, the synod can denote a regional meeting of representatives of various classes (&quot;regional synod&quot;), or the general denominational meeting of representatives from the regional synods (&quot;general&quot; or &quot;national synod&quot;). Some churches, especially the smaller denominations, do not have the regional synod tier (for example, the Reformed Church in the United States (RCUS)). Historically, these were meetings such as the Synod of Homberg.

===Church of Christ in Congo===
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the vast majority of Protestant denominations have regrouped under a religious institution named the Church of Christ in Congo or CCC, often referred to – within the Congo – simply as The Protestant Church. In the CCC structure, the &quot;national synod&quot; is the general assembly of the various churches that constitutes the CCC. From the Synod is drawn an executive committee, and a secretariat. There are also synods of the CCC in every province of the Congo, known appropriately as &quot;provincial synods&quot;. The CCC regroups 62 Protestant denominations.

<doc id="75795" wikidata="Q19943" url="?curid=75795" title="Juan Carlos I">
<text>Juan Carlos I (; Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias, born 5 January 1938) is a member of the Spanish royal family who reigned as King of Spain from 22 November 1975 until his abdication on 19 June 2014. In Spain, since his abdication, Juan Carlos has usually been referred to as the (&#x27;king emeritus&#x27;) by the press.

Juan Carlos is the son of Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, and grandson of Alfonso XIII, the last king of Spain before the abolition of the monarchy in 1931 and the subsequent declaration of the Second Spanish Republic. Juan Carlos was born in Rome, Italy, during his family&#x27;s exile. Francisco Franco took over the government of Spain after his victory in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, yet in 1947 Spain&#x27;s status as a monarchy was affirmed and a law was passed allowing Franco to choose his successor. Juan Carlos&#x27;s father assumed his claims to the throne after King Alfonso XIII died in February 1941. However, Franco saw Juan Carlos&#x27;s father to be too liberal and in 1969 declared Juan Carlos his successor as head of state.

Juan Carlos spent his early years in Italy and came to Spain in 1947 to continue his studies. After completing his secondary education in 1955, he began his military training and entered the General Military Academy at Zaragoza. Later, he attended the Naval Military School and the General Academy of the Air, and finished his tertiary education at the University of Madrid. In 1962, Juan Carlos married Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark in Athens. The couple have three children: Elena, Cristina, and Felipe. Due to Franco&#x27;s advanced age and declining health amid his struggle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Juan Carlos first began periodically acting as Spain&#x27;s head of state in the summer of 1974. In November the following year, Franco died and Juan Carlos became king.

Juan Carlos was expected to continue Franco&#x27;s legacy, but instead introduced reforms to dismantle the Francoist regime and to begin the Spanish transition to democracy soon after his accession. This led to the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 in a referendum which re-established a constitutional monarchy. In 1981, Juan Carlos played a major role in preventing a coup that attempted to revert to Francoist government in the King&#x27;s name. In 2008, he was considered the most popular leader across all Ibero-America. Hailed for his role in Spain&#x27;s transition to democracy, the King and the monarchy&#x27;s reputation began to suffer after controversies surrounding his family arose, exacerbated by the public controversy centering on an elephant-hunting trip he undertook during a time of financial crisis in Spain.

In June 2014, Juan Carlos abdicated in favour of his son, who acceded to the throne as Felipe VI. Since August 2020, Juan Carlos has lived in self-imposed exile from Spain over allegedly improper ties to business deals in Saudi Arabia. The &quot;New York Times&quot; estimated in 2014 that Juan Carlos&#x27;s fortune was around €1.8 billion ($2.3 billion).

== Early life ==
Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María was born to Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, and Princess María de las Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies in their family home in Rome, where his grandfather King Alfonso XIII and other members of the Spanish royal family lived in exile following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. He was baptized as Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII.

Juan Carlos&#x27;s early life was dictated largely by the political concerns of his father and General Francisco Franco. He moved to Spain in 1948 to be educated there after his father persuaded Franco to allow it. He began his studies in San Sebastián and finished them in 1954 at the Instituto San Isidro in Madrid. He then joined the army, doing his officer training from 1955 to 1957 at the Military Academy of Zaragoza.
According to his sister Pilar, he had difficulty in his studies because of dyslexia.
Juan Carlos has two sisters: Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz (1936–2020); and Infanta Margarita, Duchess of Soria (born 1939). He also had a younger brother, Alfonso (1941–1956). The rendering of his name as &quot;Juan Carlos&quot; (the first and second particles of his baptismal name) was a modification by choice of Franco. He was always known in his familiar circle simply as &quot;Juan&quot; or &quot;Juanito&quot;.

Together with his parents and his sister Pilar, he took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe. On this trip, Juan Carlos met the hosts&#x27; 15-year-old daughter, Sofia, his future wife, for the first time.

===Brother&#x27;s death===
On the evening of Holy Thursday, 29 March 1956, Infante Alfonso died in a gun accident at the family&#x27;s home Villa Giralda in Estoril, on the Portuguese Riviera. The Spanish Embassy in Portugal then issued the following official communiqué:

Alfonso had won a local junior golf tournament earlier in the day, then went to evening Mass and rushed up to the room to see Juan Carlos who had come home for the Easter holidays from military school. Both Juan Carlos, age 18, and Alfonso, age 14, had been apparently playing with a .22LR Star Bonifacio Echeverria Automatic pistol owned by Alfonso. As they were alone in the room, it is unclear how Alfonso was shot, but according to Josefina Carolo, dressmaker to Juan Carlos&#x27;s mother, Juan Carlos pointed the pistol at Alfonso and pulled the trigger, unaware that it was loaded. Bernardo Arnoso, a Portuguese friend of Juan Carlos, also said that Juan Carlos had told him he had fired the pistol not knowing that it was loaded, and adding that the bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Alfonso in the face. Helena Matheopoulos, a Greek author who spoke with the infantes&#x27; sister Pilar, said that Alfonso had been out of the room and when he returned and pushed the door open, the door knocked Juan Carlos in the arm, causing him to fire the pistol.

After learning this news, the Count of Barcelona reportedly grabbed Juan Carlos by the neck and shouted at him angrily, &quot;Swear to me that you didn&#x27;t do it on purpose!&quot; Two days later, the Count sent his son back to the military academy. Following a later declaration of Juan Carlos&#x27;s mother, Paul Preston argues that the content of the former testimony implies that Juan Carlos had pointed the gun at Alfonso, apparently not knowing that the gun was loaded, and pulled the trigger.

=== Education ===
In 1957, Juan Carlos spent a year in the naval school at Marín, Pontevedra, and another in the Air Force school in San Javier in Murcia. In 1960–61, he studied law, international political economy and public finance at the Complutense University of Madrid. He then went to live in the Palace of Zarzuela and began carrying out official engagements.

== Prince of Spain ==
The dictatorial regime of Francisco Franco came to power during the Spanish Civil War, which pitted a government of democrats, anarchists, socialists, and communists, supported by the Soviet Union and international volunteers, against a rebellion of conservatives, monarchists, nationalists, and fascists, supported by both Hitler and Mussolini, with the rebels ultimately winning. Franco&#x27;s authoritarian government remained dominant in Spain until the 1960s. With Franco&#x27;s increasing age, left-wing protests increased, while at the same time, the far right factions demanded the return of a hardline absolute monarchy. At the time, the heir to the throne of Spain was Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, the son of King Alfonso XIII. However, Franco viewed him with extreme suspicion, believing him to be a liberal who was opposed to his regime.

Juan Carlos&#x27;s first cousin Alfonso, Duke of Anjou and Cádiz, was also briefly considered as a candidate. Alfonso was known to be an ardent Francoist and married Franco&#x27;s granddaughter, Doña María del Carmen Martínez-Bordiú y Franco, in 1972.

Ultimately, Franco decided to skip a generation and name Infante Juan Carlos as his personal successor. Franco hoped the young prince could be groomed to take over the nation while still maintaining the ultraconservative and authoritarian nature of his regime. In 1969, Juan Carlos was officially designated heir-apparent and was given the new title of Prince of Spain (not the traditional Prince of Asturias). As a condition of being named heir-apparent, he was required to swear loyalty to Franco&#x27;s Movimiento Nacional, which he did with little outward hesitation. His choice was ratified by the Spanish parliament on 22 July 1969.

Juan Carlos met and consulted Franco many times while heir apparent and often took part in official and ceremonial state functions, standing alongside the dictator, much to the anger of hardline republicans and more moderate liberals, who hoped that Franco&#x27;s death would bring in an era of reform. During 1969–1975, Juan Carlos publicly supported Franco&#x27;s regime. Although Franco&#x27;s health worsened during those years, whenever he did appear in public, from state dinners to military parades, it was in Juan Carlos&#x27;s company. However, as the years progressed, Juan Carlos began meeting secretly with political opposition leaders and exiles, who were fighting to bring liberal reform to the country. He also had secret conversations with his father over the telephone. Franco, for his part, remained largely oblivious to the prince&#x27;s actions and denied allegations from his ministers and advisors that Juan Carlos was in any way disloyal to his vision of the regime.

During periods of Franco&#x27;s temporary incapacity in 1974 and 1975, Juan Carlos was acting head of state. On 30 October 1975, Franco gave full control to Juan Carlos. According to declassified CIA reports, during this time Juan Carlos secretly acquiesced and arranged with King Hassan II of Morocco the terms of the so-called Green March, the partial invasion of the Spanish Sahara by Moroccan civilians, followed by the Madrid Accords handing over the control of the territory to Morocco and Mauritania.

== Reign ==

Franco died on 20 November 1975, and two days later on 22 November the Cortes Españolas proclaimed Juan Carlos King of Spain. In his address to the Cortes, Juan Carlos spoke of three factors: historical tradition, national laws, and the will of the people, and in so doing referred to a process dating back to the Civil War of 1936–39. He swore using the following formula: &quot;I swear to God and the Gospels to comply and enforce compliance to the Fundamental Laws of the Realm and to remain loyal to the Principles of the National Movement&quot;.

On 27 November, a Mass of the Holy Spirit was celebrated in the church of San Jerónimo el Real in Madrid to inaugurate his reign. He opted not to call himself Juan III or Carlos V, but Juan Carlos I. Juan Carlos is reported to have been pressured by Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing to personally tell Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who had traveled to Spain for Franco&#x27;s funeral, not to attend his inauguration. In the end Pinochet did participate of the proclamation at the Palacio de las Cortes, Madrid but not in the follow-up Te Deum. In private Pinochet expressed later his disapproval of what he saw as a lack of recognition of Franco by Juan Carlos I in his speech at the Cortes.

=== Transition ===
Juan Carlos&#x27;s accession met with relatively little parliamentary opposition. Some members of the Movimiento Nacional voted against recognizing him, and even more voted against the 1976 Law for Political Reform. But a majority of Movimiento members supported both measures. Juan Carlos quickly instituted reforms, to the great displeasure of Falangist and conservative (monarchist) elements, especially in the military, who had expected him to maintain the authoritarian state.

In July 1976, Juan Carlos dismissed prime minister Carlos Arias Navarro, who had been attempting to continue Francoist policies in the face of the King&#x27;s attempts at democratization. He instead appointed Adolfo Suárez, a former leader of the Movimiento Nacional, as prime minister.

Further legitimacy was restored to Juan Carlos&#x27;s position on 14 May 1977, when his father (whom many monarchists had recognized as the legitimate, exiled King of Spain during the Franco era) formally renounced his claim to the throne and recognized his son as the sole head of the Spanish Royal House, transferring to him the historical heritage of the Spanish monarchy, thus making Juan Carlos both &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; king in the eyes of the traditional monarchists.

On 20 May 1977, the leader of the only recently legalized Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), Felipe González, accompanied by Javier Solana, visited Juan Carlos in the Zarzuela Palace. The event represented a key endorsement of the monarchy from Spain&#x27;s political left, who had been historically republican. Left-wing support for the monarchy had grown when the Communist Party of Spain was legalized on 9 April 1977, a move Juan Carlos had pressed for, despite enormous right-wing military opposition at that time, during the Cold War.

On 15 June 1977, Spain held its first post-Franco democratic elections. Juan Carlos had played a role as middleman in order to channel $10 million from the Shah of Iran to Adolfo Suárez&#x27;s election campaign, reportedly asking the Shah for the money to &quot;save Spain from Marxism&quot;. Suárez went on to win the election and become the first democratically elected leader of the new regime.

In 1978, the government promulgated a new constitution that acknowledged Juan Carlos as rightful heir of the Spanish dynasty and king; specifically, Title II, Section 57 asserted Juan Carlos&#x27;s right to the throne of Spain by dynastic succession in the Bourbon tradition, as &quot;the legitimate heir of the historic dynasty&quot; rather than as the designated successor of Franco. The Constitution was passed by the democratically elected Constituent Cortes, ratified by the people in a referendum (6 December) and then signed into law by the King before a solemn meeting of the Cortes.

=== 1981 coup d&#x27;état attempt ===

An attempted military coup, known as 23-F, occurred on 23 February 1981, when the Cortes were seized by members of the Guardia Civil in the parliamentary chamber. During the coup, the King, wearing his uniform as Captain-General of the Armed Forces, gave a public television broadcast calling for unambiguous support for the legitimate democratic government. The broadcast is believed to have been a major factor in foiling the coup. The coup leaders had promised many of their potential supporters that they were acting in the King&#x27;s name and with his approval, but were unable to demonstrate either, and the broadcast — coming just after midnight on the night of the coup — definitively showed the King&#x27;s opposition to the coup makers.

When Juan Carlos became king, Communist leader Santiago Carrillo had nicknamed him &quot;Juan Carlos the Brief&quot;, predicting that the monarchy would soon be swept away with the other remnants of the Franco era. After the collapse of the attempted coup however, in an emotional statement, Carrillo remarked: &quot;Today, we are all monarchists.&quot; Public support for the monarchy among democrats and leftists, which had been limited before 1981, increased significantly following the king&#x27;s handling of the coup.

However, this event remains controversial and has led to several alternative theories that cast doubt on the sincerity of the King&#x27;s defense of democracy. The King had close ties with the leader of the rebellion, who had served him as Secretary General of the Royal Household. Above all, Juan Carlos and the main political parties were aware of a plan to put General Alfonso Armada in charge of the government, particularly in order to crack down on the Basque independence organization Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA). Although Juan Carlos strongly condemned the coup attempt — more than six hours after the armed guards invaded Congress — it is still difficult to establish whether he acted out of democratic conviction or because the operation was not going as well as expected, with little support. The reasons for the trial of the coup plotters are still classified.

=== Later role in Spanish politics ===

The victory of the PSOE in 1982 under González marked the effective end of the King&#x27;s active involvement in Spanish politics. González governed for 14 years, longer than any other democratically elected Prime Minister. His administration helped consolidate Spanish democracy and thus maintained the stability of the nation.

On paper, Juan Carlos retained fairly extensive reserve powers. He was the guardian of the Constitution and was responsible for ensuring that it was obeyed. In practice, since the passage of the Constitution (and especially since 1982), he took a mostly non-partisan and representative role, acting almost entirely on the advice of the government. However, he commanded great moral authority as an essential symbol of the country&#x27;s unity.

Under the Constitution, the King has immunity from prosecution in matters relating to his official duties. Consequently, he exercised most of his powers through the ministers; his acts as King (and not as a citizen) were not valid unless countersigned by a minister, who became politically responsible for the act in question.

As head of the Spanish state, Juan Carlos &quot;held political power, gave his opinion and exerted his influence in the economic sphere, for example, in the area of company mergers or public policy during the transition period,&quot; analyses journalist Ana Pardo.

The honour of the royal family is specifically protected from insult by the Spanish Penal Code. Under this protection, Basque independentist Arnaldo Otegi and cartoonists from &quot;El Jueves&quot; were tried and punished.

The King gave an annual speech to the nation on Christmas Eve and was, as King, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish armed forces.

In October 1990, Juan Carlos visited the Chilean city of Valdivia amidst the beginning of the Chilean transition to democracy. While he and the Queen were cheered by some, groups of indigenous Mapuches approached the king some to protest past colonialism and others to have the King ratify past Mapuche-Spanish treaties. According to &quot;El País&quot; political infighting between Mapuches prevented Juan Carlos from hosting an official meeting with Mapuche representatives.

In July 2000, Juan Carlos was the target of an enraged protester when former priest Juan María Fernández y Krohn, who had once attacked Pope John Paul II, breached security and attempted to approach the king.

When the media asked Juan Carlos in 2005 whether he would endorse the bill legalising same-sex marriage that was then being debated in the &quot;Cortes Generales&quot;, he answered &quot;Soy el Rey de España y no el de Bélgica&quot; (&quot;I am the King of Spain, not of Belgium&quot;)a reference to King Baudouin of Belgium, who had refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. The King gave his Royal Assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005; the law legalising same-sex marriage was gazetted in the &quot;Boletín Oficial del Estado&quot; on 2 July, and came into effect on 3 July.

According to a poll in the newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot; in November 2005, 77.5% of Spaniards thought Juan Carlos was &quot;good or very good&quot;, 15.4% &quot;not so good&quot;, and only 7.1% &quot;bad or very bad&quot;. Even so, the issue of the monarchy re-emerged on 28 September 2007 as photos of the king were burnt in public in Catalonia by small groups of protesters wanting the restoration of the Republic.

==== 2007 Ibero-American Summit ====

In November 2007, at the Ibero-American Summit in Santiago, during a heated exchange, Juan Carlos interrupted Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, saying, &quot;¿Por qué no te callas?&quot; (&quot;Why don&#x27;t you shut up?&quot;). Chávez had been interrupting the Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, while the latter was defending his predecessor and political opponent, José María Aznar, after Chávez had referred to Aznar as a fascist and &quot;less human than snakes&quot;. The King shortly afterwards left the hall when President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua accused Spain of intervention in his country&#x27;s elections and complained about some Spanish energy companies working in Nicaragua. This was an unprecedented diplomatic incident and a rare display of public anger by the King.

==== Budget of the royal house ====
Juan Carlos detailed for the first time in 2011 the yearly royal budget of €8.3 million, excluding expenses such as the electricity bill, paid by the State.

==== Botswana hunting trip ====
In April 2012, Juan Carlos faced criticism for an elephant-hunting trip in Botswana. The public found out about the trip only after the King injured himself and a special aircraft was sent to bring him home. Spanish officials stated that the expenses of the trip were not paid by taxpayers or by the palace, but by Mohamed Eyad Kayali, a businessman of Syrian origin. Cayo Lara Moya of the United Left party said the King&#x27;s trip &quot;demonstrated a lack of ethics and respect toward many people in this country who are suffering a lot&quot; while Tomás Gómez of the Socialist party said Juan Carlos should choose between &quot;public responsibilities or an abdication&quot;. In April 2012, Spain&#x27;s unemployment was at 23% and nearly 50% for young workers. &quot;El País&quot; estimated the total cost of a hunting trip at €44,000, about twice the average annual salary in Spain. A petition called for the king to resign from his position as honorary president of the Spanish branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature. The WWF itself responded by asking for an interview with the King to resolve the situation. In July 2012, WWF Spain held a meeting in Madrid and decided with 226 votes to 13 to remove the King from its honorary presidency. He later apologised for the hunting trip.

Up until the Botswana elephant trip, Juan Carlos had enjoyed a high level of shielding from media scrutiny, described as &quot;rare among Western leaders&quot;.

===Interfaith work===
On the 500th anniversary of the Alhambra Decree in 1992, King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia visited the Beth Yaacov Synagogue in Madrid, led by Chief Rabbif of Madrid Yehuda Benasouli to commemorate the occasion. While Sofia had been to the synagogue in the 1970s, the occasion marked the first time that the king had visited a synagogue in Spain. The Spanish royals were joined by Israeli President Chaim Herzog, Herzog&#x27;s predecessor Yitzhak Navon, Rabbi Solomon Gaon and other Israeli and Spanish officials. Also present were descendants of Abraham Senior and Isaac Abarbanel, who had unsuccessfully petitioned King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella to retract the edict.

In 2008, Juan Carlos spoke at the opening of a 3-day Saudi-sponsored World Conference on Dialogue interfaith conference at the Royal Palace of El Pardo outside Madrid. The conference was attended by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, Rabbi David Rosen, and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

=== Abdication ===

Spanish news media started to speculate about the King&#x27;s future in 2013, following public criticism over his taking an elephant hunting safari in Botswana and an embezzlement scandal involving his daughter, Infanta Cristina, Duchess of Palma de Mallorca, and her husband Iñaki Urdangarin. The King&#x27;s private secretary, Rafael Spottorno, denied in a briefing that the &quot;abdication option&quot; was being considered.

On the morning of 2 June 2014, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy made a televised announcement that the King had told him of his intention to abdicate. Later, the King delivered a televised address and announced that he would abdicate the throne in favour of the Prince of Asturias. Royal officials described the King&#x27;s choice as a personal decision which he had been contemplating since his 76th birthday at the start of the year. The King reportedly said, &quot;No queremos que mi hijo se marchite esperando como el príncipe Carlos.&quot; (English: &quot;We do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles.&quot;)

As required by the Spanish constitution, any abdication would be settled by means of an organic law. A draft law was passed with 299 in favour, 19 against and 23 abstaining. On 18 June, he signed the organic law passed by parliament several hours before his abdication took effect. Felipe was enthroned on 19 June 2014, and Juan Carlos&#x27;s granddaughter Leonor became the new Princess of Asturias. Juan Carlos was the fourth European monarch to abdicate in just over a year, following Pope Benedict XVI (28 February 2013), Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands (30 April 2013), and King Albert II of Belgium (21 July 2013).

The Spanish constitution at the time of the abdication did not grant an abdicated monarch the legal immunity of a head of state, but the government changed the law to allow this. However, unlike his previous immunity, the new legislation left him accountable to the supreme court, in a similar type of protection afforded to many high-ranking civil servants and politicians in Spain. The legislation stipulates that all outstanding legal matters relating to the former king be suspended and passed &quot;immediately&quot; to the supreme court.

==== Reactions ====
The Spanish press gave the announcement a broadly positive reception, but described the moment as an &quot;institutional crisis&quot; and &quot;a very important moment in the history of democratic Spain&quot;. Around Spain and in major cities (including London) the news was met by republican celebration and protests, calling for the end of the monarchy.

Catalan leader Artur Mas said that the news of the King&#x27;s abdication would not slow down the process of independence for Catalonia. Iñigo Urkullu, the President of the Basque government, concluded that the King&#x27;s reign was &quot;full of light yet also darkness&quot; and said that his successor Felipe should remember that &quot;the Basque Question has not been resolved&quot;. Other regional leaders had more positive evaluations of Juan Carlos following his decision to abdicate: Alberto Núñez Feijóo of Galicia called him &quot;the King of Democracy&quot; who &quot;guaranteed the continuation of constitutional monarchy&quot; and Alberto Fabra of the Valencian Community said that Spaniards are proud of their king who had been &quot;at the forefront of protecting our interests inside and outside of our borders&quot;.

British Prime Minister David Cameron stated: &quot;I would like to use this opportunity to make a tribute to King Juan Carlos, who has done so much during his reign to aid the successful Spanish transition to democracy, and has been a great friend of the United Kingdom.&quot; The President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, said that Juan Carlos was a &quot;believer in Europeanism and modernity...without whom one could not understand modern Spain&quot;.

The Spanish public also gave a broadly positive opinion not only of the abdication but of his reign as a whole. According to a poll taken by &quot;El Mundo&quot;, 65% saw the King&#x27;s reign as either good or very good, up from 41.3%. Overall, 55.7% of those polled in the 3–5 June survey by Sigma Dos supported the institution of the monarchy in Spain, up from 49.9% when the same question was posed six months prior. 57.5% believed the Prince could restore the royal family&#x27;s lost prestige. An overwhelming majority of Spaniards believed the new King, Felipe VI, would make a good monarch and more than three-quarters believed King Juan Carlos had been right to hand over the throne to his son.

== Retirement ==
After abdication, Juan Carlos continued to have a role as institutional representative of the Crown.

From June 2014 to June 2019, he attended several Latin American presidential inaugurations such as the second inauguration of Juan Manuel Santos as president of Colombia, the inauguration of Tabaré Vázquez as president of Uruguay, and the inauguration of Mauricio Macri as president of Argentina. He also represented the Crown in different cultural and sports events, funerals, and awards ceremonies. Finally, the former sovereign was also present in the events about the 40th anniversary of the Spanish Constitution of 1978.

On 27 May 2019, King Juan Carlos announced by a letter to his son Felipe his intention to retire from public life on 2 June 2019, five years after his abdication.

===Corruption investigations===

==== 2020 Saudi rail deal ====

Recordings of the former King&#x27;s alleged mistress Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn speaking with a former police chief were leaked to the press in mid-2018. Sayn-Wittgenstein claimed that Juan Carlos received kick-backs from commercial contracts in the Gulf States – particularly in the late-2000s construction of the €6.7 billion Haramain high-speed railway in Saudi Arabia – and maintained these proceeds in a bank account in Switzerland. She alleged that he purchased properties in Monaco under her name to circumvent the tax treatment of lawful residents, stating &quot;[not] because he [loved] me a lot, but because I reside in Monaco.&quot; She further claimed the head of the Spanish intelligence service warned her that her life, and those of her children, would be at risk if she spoke of their association. The allegations drew demands for Juan Carlos to be investigated for corruption in early June 2019.

Swiss authorities began investigating Juan Carlos in March 2020 in relation to a $100 million gift to Sayn-Wittgenstein in 2012. This donation was linked to alleged kick-back fees from Saudi Arabia. Sayn-Wittgenstein reportedly told the head Swiss prosecutor on 19 December 2018 that Juan Carlos had given her €65 million out of &quot;gratitude and love&quot;, to guarantee her future and her children&#x27;s, because &quot;he still had hopes to win her back&quot;. A letter written by Juan Carlos to his Swiss lawyers in 2018 stated the gift was irrevocable, despite his having asked in 2014 for the return of the money. On 14 March 2020, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that his son Felipe, King of Spain since 2014, appeared as second beneficiary (after Juan Carlos) of the Lucum Foundation, which had received a €65 million donation by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. On 15 March 2020, the Royal Household declared that Felipe VI would renounce any inheritance from his father. Additionally, the Household announced that the former king would lose his public stipend from the State&#x27;s General Budget.

In June 2020, the public prosecutor&#x27;s office of the Supreme Court of Spain agreed to investigate Juan Carlos&#x27;s role as facilitator in Phase II of the high speed rail connecting Mecca and Medina, intending to determine the criminal relevance of events that took place after his abdication in June 2014. As King of Spain, Juan Carlos was immune from prosecution from 1975 to 2014 by sovereign immunity.

A further investigation by Swiss authorities was undertaken regarding €3.5 million paid from the Lucum Foundation to the Bahamas-based bank Pictet &amp; Ciein for a society called Dolphin, which was controlled by the lawyer Dante Canónica, who also controlled Lucum.

In December 2021, the Swiss prosecutors dropped all cases due to the impossibility of proving any illegality.

====Credit cards and bank accounts====
Spanish prosecutors opened an investigation into the use by Juan Carlos and other members of the royal family of credit cards used between 2016 and 2018 which were paid for by an overseas account to which neither Juan Carlos nor any member of the royal family were signatories, leading to accusations that the funds are undisclosed assets of Juan Carlos, and as the card drawings exceeded €120,000 in one year, comprised undisclosed income and was therefore a tax offence in Spain. Mexican millionaire and investment banker Allen Sanginés-Krause has been named as the owner of the cards, a friend of Juan Carlos to whom he donated sums of money using Air Force Colonel Nicolás Murga Mendoza as an intermediary.

In December 2020, Juan Carlos reportedly paid 678,393.72 euros to Spain&#x27;s tax agency for the concept of defrauded money in an affair of &quot;opaque credit cards&quot; used between 2016 and 2018 by himself, his wife and some grandchildren, intending to avoid further scrutiny from the Supreme Court&#x27;s prosecutor, the payment being an admission of fraud.

Swiss and Spanish prosecutors also investigated several accounts related to the former King, such as an account in Switzerland with almost €8 million and an attempt to withdraw nearly €10 million from Jersey, possibly from a trust set up by or for Juan Carlos in the 1990s. Juan Carlos claims he is &quot;not responsible for any Jersey trust and never has been, either directly or indirectly&quot;.

In March 2022, Spanish prosecutors closed all cases against him following the same decision from Swiss prosecutors in December 2021.

====Zagatka Foundation====
Founded in Liechtenstein in 2003 and owned by Álvaro de Orleans-Borbón, a distant cousin of Juan Carlos who lives in Monaco received a large sum of money from Switzerland, Juan Carlos is named as the third beneficiary. In 2009 Álvaro de Orleans-Borbón paid a cheque from Mexico for €4.3 million into the account which the Swiss adjudicated belonged to Juan Carlos. Juan Carlos appears to have drawn down funds from the Zagatka foundation to spend €8 million between 2009 and 2018 on private flights, with Air Partner receiving around €6.1 million. Zagatka used commissions due to Juan Carlos and paid to Zagatka to invest millions, mainly in Ibex35 companies between 2003 and 2018.

On 25 February 2021, Juan Carlos paid 4 million euros to the Spanish Tax Agency to avoid new tax offenses in relation with these flights.

====Lucum foundation====
A Panamanian Lucum foundation had Juan Carlos as the first beneficiary and King Felipe VI as a named second beneficiary, although Felipe has subsequently relinquished any inheritance from his father Juan Carlos. Lucum received $100 million from the Saudi royal house in 2008. Swiss prosecutors are concerned about who at the Swiss bank Mirabaud &amp; Cie knows who the account was for and what was discovered about the source of the funds from the Ministry of Finance of Saudi Arabia. They are also concerned about a transfer of €3.5m from Lucum to an account held by Dante Canónica in the Bahamas. In 2012 the Mirabaud bank, which had concealed from its employees the beneficial owner of the account, asked for the account to be closed, due to possible adverse publicity; this was when the bulk of the funds were transferred to Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn.

===Claims of harassment===
In 2020, Sayn-Wittgenstein, resident in the United Kingdom, filed an harassment case in London against Juan Carlos, claiming he&#x27;d pressured her to return the money given to her after their break up in 2012. In 2022, Juan Carlos won an appeal that he had immunity from those allegations relating to 2012–2014 when he was still King.

In 2023, the High Court of England and Wales threw out the case on the grounds that it had no jurisdiction in the matter, but made no judgement as to the substance of the allegations.

===Relocation abroad===

On 3 August 2020, the Royal Household announced Juan Carlos wished to relocate from Spain because of increased media press about his business dealings in Saudi Arabia, and he had left a letter to his son saying so. By the time the letter had been made public, he had already left the country. Journalists speculated that he might have fled to the Dominican Republic, Portugal, France, and Italy, and, later, as of 7 August, the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi. The Royal Household initially declined requests to publicly disclose Juan Carlos&#x27;s location; on 17 August, the Royal Household confirmed that, since 3 August, Juan Carlos had been in the United Arab Emirates, where he arrived by taking a private plane from Vigo Airport.

Since then, he has visited Spain regularly, mainly the town of Sanxenxo, in the north of Spain, to do one of his favorite activities, sailing. He was also present at the private celebration that the Spanish royal family made at the Royal Palace of El Pardo to celebrate Leonor&#x27;s 18th birthday.

== Family and private life ==
Juan Carlos was married on 14 May 1962, to Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark, daughter of King Paul of Greece, firstly in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Church of St. Denis, followed by a Greek Orthodox ceremony at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens. She converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism. They have three children:
# Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo (born 20 December 1963)
# Infanta Cristina (born 13 June 1965)
# King Felipe VI of Spain (born 30 January 1968)

Juan Carlos is also allegedly the father of Albert Solà, born in Barcelona in 1956, also of a woman born in Catalonia in 1964, and of Ingrid Sartiau, a Belgian woman born in 1966 who has filed a paternity suit, but complete sovereign immunity prevented that suit prior to his abdication.

Juan Carlos had several extramarital affairs, which adversely affected his marriage. In 2021, the former police official José Manuel Villarejo testified that Juan Carlos was given hormones to reduce his sex drive, as it was seen as a state problem.

In 1972, Juan Carlos, a keen sailor, competed in the Dragon class event at the Olympic Games, finishing 15th. During their summer holidays, the whole family spends time at Marivent Palace (Palma de Mallorca) and on the yacht &quot;Fortuna&quot;, where they would take part in sailing competitions. The king has manned the Bribón series of yachts. In winter, the family often went skiing in Baqueira-Beret and Candanchú (Pyrenees). At present, his hobbies include classic sailing boats. He also hunts bears; in October 2004, he angered environmental activists by killing nine bears in central Romania, one of which was pregnant. It was alleged by the Russian regional authorities that in August 2006 Juan Carlos shot a drunken tame bear (Mitrofan the Bear) during a private hunting trip to Russia; the Office of the Spanish Monarchy denied this claim.

He is a member of the World Scout Foundation and of the Sons of the American Revolution.

==Health==
A benign 17–19 mm tumour was removed under general anaesthetic from King Juan Carlos&#x27;s right lung in an operation carried out in the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona in May 2010. The operation followed an annual check-up, and Juan Carlos was not expected to need any further treatment. He was treated in Clinica Planas.

In April 2012, the King underwent surgery for a triple fracture of the hip at the San Jose Hospital, Madrid, following a fall on a private elephant-hunting trip to Botswana. He also underwent a hip operation in September 2013 at Madrid&#x27;s Quirón hospital. In April 2018, Juan Carlos was admitted to hospital for a surgery on his right knee.

On 24 August 2019 he had heart surgery.

== In popular culture ==
His life between 1948 and 1993 is dealt in the 2014 miniseries &quot;&quot;.

As of 2021, there are four television projects in development set to portray the former king, some of which span along a wider time period of the Royal Household: &quot;Palacio real. Brillo y tragedia de la monarquía española&quot; (Diagonal TV), &quot;El rey&quot; (The Mediapro Studio), &quot;El emérito&quot; (Mandarina Producciones) and &quot;XRey&quot; (Starzplay, Sony Pictures TV and The Weekend Studio).

== Titles, styles, honours and arms ==


In 1969, Juan Carlos was named as General Franco&#x27;s successor and was given the title of &#x27;Prince of Spain&#x27;. Upon the death of Franco in 1975, Juan Carlos acceded to the throne of Spain. The current Spanish constitution refers to the monarch by the simple title &quot;King of Spain&quot;. Aside from this title, the constitution allows for the use of other historic titles pertaining to the Spanish monarchy, without specifying them. This was also reiterated by a decree promulgated on 6 November 1987 concerning titles of members of the royal family. Since his abdication in 2014, King Juan Carlos has retained, by courtesy, the title of king and style of &quot;majesty&quot; that he enjoyed during his reign. Likewise, he maintains his military rank in reserve.

<text>Roanoke ( ) is an independent city in Virginia, United States. It is located in Southwest Virginia along the Roanoke River, in the Blue Ridge range of the greater Appalachian Mountains. Roanoke is approximately north of the VirginiaNorth Carolina border and southwest of Washington, D.C., along Interstate 81. At the 2020 census, Roanoke&#x27;s population was 100,011, making it the most-populous city in Virginia west of the state capital Richmond. It is the primary population center of the Roanoke metropolitan area, which had a population of 315,251 in 2020.

The Roanoke Valley was originally home to members of the Siouan-speaking Tutelo tribe. However, in the 17th and early-to-mid 18th centuries, Scotch-Irish and later German American farmers gradually drove those Native Americans out of the area as the American frontier pressed westward. In 1882, the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W) chose the small town of Big Lick as the site of its corporate headquarters and railroad shops. Within two years, the town had become the City of Roanoke. With a 2,300% population growth rate in the decade from 1880 to 1890, the young city experienced the advantages and disadvantages of its boomtown status. During the 20th century, Roanoke&#x27;s boundaries expanded through multiple annexations from the surrounding Roanoke County, and it became Southwest Virginia&#x27;s economic and cultural hub. The 1982 decision by N&amp;W to relocate their headquarters out of the city, combined with other manufacturing closures, led Roanoke to pivot to a primarily service economy. In the 21st century, a robust healthcare industry and the development and increased marketing of its outdoor amenities have helped reverse prior declining population trends.

Roanoke is known for the Roanoke Star, an illuminated star that sits atop a mountain within the city&#x27;s limits and is the origin of its nickname, &quot;The Star City of the South&quot;. Other points of interest include the Hotel Roanoke, a 330-room Tudor Revival structure built by N&amp;W in 1882, the Taubman Museum of Art, designed by architect Randall Stout, and the city&#x27;s farmer&#x27;s market, the oldest continuously operating open-air market in the state. The Roanoke Valley features of greenways with bicycle and pedestrian trails, and the city&#x27;s location in the Blue Ridge Mountains provides access to numerous outdoor recreation opportunities.

The current site of Roanoke lies near the intersection of the Great Wagon Road and the Carolina Road, two branches of a network of early colonial roads that developed from Native American trails in the Appalachian region. While the name &quot;Roanoke&quot; is said to have originated from a Native American word for shell beads used as currency, that word was first used away, where the Roanoke River empties into the Atlantic Ocean near Roanoke Island. The Roanoke Valley itself was originally home to members of the Tutelo tribe, a Siouan-speaking people who were gradually pushed out of the area by advancing European settlers.

Many of those settlers were Scotch-Irish who arrived in the region during the 18th and early 19th centuries following the Plantation of Ulster. They were followed by significant numbers of Germans from Pennsylvania via the Great Wagon Road. By 1838, the area was populated enough that Roanoke County was created out of parts of Botetourt and Montgomery Counties, and the area&#x27;s first railroad, the Virginia and Tennessee, arrived in 1852.

The railroad built its new depot just south of a small town named Gainesborough, but named the depot after Big Lick, another small community located just to the east, which itself was named after the salt deposits that had drawn game to the area for years. Gainesborough increasingly became referred to as Big Lick (and later as Old Lick) once development drifted farther south towards the depot. Growth in the area was stalled by the Civil War; Roanoke County voted 850–0 in favor of secession and lost many of its men in the subsequent fighting. The burgeoning tobacco trade helped the region&#x27;s recovery during Reconstruction. Within a decade of the war&#x27;s end, there were no fewer than six tobacco factories near the Big Lick Depot.

In 1874, the community surrounding the depot applied for and received a town charter, and the Town of Big Lick was formally established. Eight years later, efforts by town boosters succeeded in securing Big Lick as the junction of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W). The two companies also relocated their respective headquarters to the town (the two lines would officially merge in 1890). Big Lick&#x27;s relatively small size compared to the nearby county seat, Salem, worked in its favor as a draw for the companies. Big Lick&#x27;s ample farmland and nearby water sources were well suited to the railroads&#x27; goal of building much of the town from scratch, including railroad shops, offices, a hotel, and suitable housing for their many employees.

In the early 1880s, Big Lick&#x27;s residents voted to rename the town &quot;Kimball&quot; after Frederick J. Kimball, an executive for the two railroad companies who played a significant role in their new location. Kimball turned down the honor, saying, &quot;On the Roanoke River in Roanoke County – name it Roanoke.&quot; The town obliged, officially becoming the Town of Roanoke on February 3, 1882. The new charter also annexed nearly of additional land, including the Town of Gainesborough (later shortened to Gainsboro), which by that point had already become the center of the area&#x27;s African American community. Kimball chose a wheat field north of the railroad tracks and east of Gainsboro for the N&amp;W&#x27;s new hotel, and the 69-room Hotel Roanoke – designed originally in the Queen Anne style before numerous rebuilds and expansions gave it its current Tudor Revival appearance – opened its doors in 1882.

With the rapid influx of railroad employees and others in associated industries, Roanoke&#x27;s population soared and, by the end of 1883, had passed 5,000. That milestone made the town eligible for a city charter, and on January 31, 1884, the town became the City of Roanoke.

With a population that ballooned from under 700 residents in 1880 to over 16,000 in 1890 and earning itself the nickname &quot;The Magic City&quot; in the process Roanoke suffered many of the same difficulties that affected other 19th century boomtowns. Its infrastructure was essentially nonexistent, and a lack of sewers combined with the area&#x27;s marshy terrain contributed to regular outbreaks of diphtheria and cholera. Bond initiatives designed to alleviate these and other issues highlighted racial tensions in the city, as the African American community – roughly 30 percent of Roanoke&#x27;s population in 1891 – opposed the measures because the money would only be used to improve white neighborhoods. Black neighborhoods in Roanoke typically received public amenities such as running water and paved roads only after their white counterparts, and Roanoke was among the first to adopt the Jim Crow laws that were becoming increasingly popular in the South. The local press, for its part, stoked the white population&#x27;s fears and anxiety with near-constant reports of African American &quot;savagery&quot;.

In September 1893, tensions boiled over when a white woman was allegedly robbed and beaten by an African-American man, Thomas Smith, near the city&#x27;s market. Smith was held in the city jail; a mob of hundreds surrounded the building and demanded &quot;lynch justice&quot;. A shootout between the mob and an undermanned militia ensued, leaving eight dead and thirty-one more injured. Included among the wounded was the city&#x27;s mayor, the previously widely admired Henry S. Trout, who had vowed protection of the prisoner. The rioting mob was eventually successful in gaining control of Smith. They proceeded to hang him and mutilate his body, which was eventually burned when the mob was deterred from its initial plan to bury it in Mayor Trout&#x27;s front yard. The mayor himself was forced to flee the city out of fear for his life and only returned a week later after the national press condemned the riot and praised Trout&#x27;s courage during the event.

=== 20th century present ===
Despite these and other setbacks, the city grew through the early 20th century, both in area and population. In addition to the land gained in its 1882 town charter, relatively unopposed annexations occurred five more times by 1926, though Roanoke County would become less agreeable to later attempts. Mill Mountain became a popular entertainment locale for early residents; an observation tower and the Rockledge Inn each opened atop the mountain in 1892. Mountain Park, an early amusement center complete with a casino and roller coaster, opened at the foot of the mountain in 1903, and beginning in 1910 visitors could pay a quarter to ride an incline railway to the top of Mill Mountain and back.

Another mainstay at the base of the mountain was Roanoke Memorial Hospital. Completed in 1900 as Roanoke Hospital, the building has undergone many expansions and today is the flagship of the Carilion Clinic healthcare group. The hospital joined some manufacturing operations that were established along the banks of the Roanoke River in the early 20th century, including the American Viscose Corporation. That company built a plant in 1917 that by a decade later employed 5,000 and was reportedly the largest rayon producing mill in the world.

The city leased land for an airfield beginning in 1929. Still, its development into the region&#x27;s primary airport did not begin until its designation as a defense project provided federal funding in 1940. That same year, N&amp;W donated the fairground, Maher Field, to the city to build a stadium and armory. Victory Stadium optimistically named upon its completion in 1942 played host to the annual Thanksgiving Day football game between Virginia Tech and Virginia Military Institute for years afterward.

By the mid-20th century, Roanoke was increasingly losing population and businesses to a Roanoke County that had become less rural and more suburban in nature and consequently more resistant to annexation attempts by the city. The city was nevertheless successful in annexing additional land in 1943, 1949, three small acquisitions in 1965, 1967, and 1968, and once more in 1976. The county won immunity from further annexations in 1980, but by then, the city had grown from its original size of to .
In 1949, the local merchants association erected an illuminated star at the top of Mill Mountain in celebration of the upcoming Christmas shopping season. The star was an immediate hit among the city&#x27;s population, leading to its illumination year-round and earning the city its nickname of &quot;Star City of the South&quot;. Despite the popularity boost for the merchants association, shopping habits in Roanoke were becoming more fractured as suburban shopping centers drew patrons away from an increasingly vacant downtown. Crossroads Mall, the first enclosed shopping center in Virginia, and Towers Mall, at the time one of the largest shopping centers in the state, were each completed in 1961. In later years, Tanglewood Mall (1973) and Valley View Mall (1985) contributed to Roanoke&#x27;s status as the region&#x27;s retail hub.

Mid-century change to the city came in the form of a massive &quot;urban renewal&quot; effort that saw the construction of both the Roanoke Civic Center (now Berglund Center) as well as an interstate spur into downtown Roanoke. Much of the land for these projects was in Northeast Roanoke, a community of primarily African American citizens who had been largely redlined from the rest of the city. City officials gained the land through eminent domain and proceeded to clear over 1,000 buildings, often through widescale burning. Later projects in the largely black Gainsboro neighborhood removed hundreds of homes and businesses there as well, and late-20th and early-21st century revitalization efforts by the city&#x27;s government have been met with distrust and varied success.

The second half of the 20th century ushered in a change of identity for Roanoke. In 1982, the N&amp;W completed a merger with the Southern Railway to form the Norfolk Southern Railway, which then relocated their headquarters from Roanoke to Norfolk, Virginia. The company closed their regional headquarters in Roanoke in 2015, and in 2020 shuttered the locomotive shops. The railroad&#x27;s departure and a string of manufacturing plant closures left a hole in the city&#x27;s economic base.

In 1987, however, the merger of two of the area&#x27;s largest hospitals created the forerunner of Carilion Clinic, a medical group that is the largest employer in the state west of Richmond. The group&#x27;s partnerships with Virginia Tech and Radford University have created two colleges and a research facility in what was formerly an industrial brownfield area, but has since been termed the city&#x27;s &quot;innovation corridor&quot;. These developments, along with the city&#x27;s decision to improve its parks and recreation amenities and market itself as an outdoor tourism hotspot, have helped reverse its decades-long loss of young adults, and in 2020 Roanoke&#x27;s population passed 100,000 for the first time since 1980.

==Geography==

Roanoke is the largest city in Virginia west of Richmond and is located in the Blue Ridge Mountains, a range which is part of the greater Appalachian Mountains. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.8%) is water. It is located in the center of the greater Roanoke Valley and is bisected by the Roanoke River, which flows west-to-east through the city. Within the city limits is Mill Mountain, a mountain and 500-acre municipal park which stands detached from the surrounding ranges.

Roanoke&#x27;s location in the Blue Ridge Mountains makes it proximate to hundreds of species of plants and wildlife. The area is home to at least 43 species of salamander, and the Poor Mountain Natural Area Preserve in neighboring Roanoke County protects the world&#x27;s largest collection of piratebush, an exceedingly rare parasitic plant endemic to the Appalachians.
Roanoke is the largest city along both the Appalachian Trail, which runs through Roanoke County just north of the city, and the Blue Ridge Parkway, which runs just south of the city. Carvins Cove, the third-largest municipal park in America at , lies in northeast Roanoke County and southwest Botetourt County. Smith Mountain Lake is several miles southeast of the city, and the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests are nearby. Outdoor pursuits in the region include hiking, mountain biking, cross-country running, canoeing, kayaking, fly fishing, and disc golf.

===Neighborhoods===
Roanoke is divided into 49 separate neighborhoods. The city has incorporated into its comprehensive plan the goal of developing these neighborhoods into &quot;villages&quot;, each with their own village center, and with the Downtown neighborhood acting as the village center for the city as a whole. The Raleigh Court neighborhood has been cited as a model for such development, consisting of a variety of residential settings located around Grandin Village, an active commercial hub anchored by the Grandin Theatre, the city&#x27;s only surviving historic theater. That commercial district is one of the city&#x27;s eight neighborhoods (or portions thereof) that have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Climate===
Though located along the Blue Ridge Mountains at elevations exceeding , Roanoke lies in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with four distinct, but generally mild, seasons. It is located in USDA hardiness zone 7b, with the suburbs falling in zone 7a. Extremes in temperature have ranged from (as recently as August 21, 1983) down to on December 30, 1917. However, neither nor are reached in most years; the most recent occurrence of each is July 20, 2020, and February 20, 2015, respectively. More typically, the area records an average of 6.1 days where the temperature stays at or below freezing and 30.5 days with + highs annually. The monthly mean temperature ranges from in January to in July.

Based on the 1991−2020 period, the city averages of snow per winter. Roanoke experienced a mild snow drought in the 2000s, which ended in December 2009 when of snow fell on Roanoke in a single storm. Winter snowfall has ranged from trace amounts in 1918–19 and 1919–20 to in 1959–60; unofficially, the largest single storm dumped approximately three feet (0.9 m) from December 16−18, 1890.

Historically, flooding has been the primary weather-related hazard faced by Roanoke. Heavy rains, most frequently from the remnants of a hurricane, drain from surrounding areas to the narrow Roanoke Valley. The most recent significant flood was in the fall of 2018, when the remains of Hurricane Michael dumped over five inches of rain on the area in the span of only a few hours. The most severe flooding in the city&#x27;s history occurred on November 4, 1985, when heavy storms from Hurricane Juan stalled over the area. Ten people drowned in the Roanoke Valley and others were saved by rescue personnel. That incident prompted a major flood reduction effort completed in 2012 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has limited the damage caused by subsequent storms.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
At the 2020 census, there were 100,011 people residing in 44,411 households in the city, 21,199 of which housed families. The population density was . The racial makeup of the city was 55.94% White, 27.07% African American, 0.21% Native American, 2.46% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.52% from other races, and 5.26% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.48% of the population.

Among the city&#x27;s households, 25.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them. 30.4% were married couples living together, while 37.4% had a female householder with no spouse or partner present. In total, 42.3% were non-families. 38.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. 24.0% of the population were under the age of 20, and 17.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39.1 years.

According to the unofficial American Community Survey, the median household income in Roanoke was $45,664, and the median family income was $55,345. The per capita income was $29,585. About 20.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.2% of those under age 18 and 12.3% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==

Roanoke&#x27;s economy was long closely linked to its status as the headquarters for the Norfolk and Western Railway. As time progressed, manufacturing and mining businesses contributed to the region&#x27;s growth. After the N&amp;W&#x27;s merger with the Southern Railway created the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1982, Norfolk Southern continued to operate maintenance facilities and a rail yard in Roanoke but moved its headquarters to Norfolk, Virginia, and in 2015 moved out of its downtown Roanoke office building. On May 18, 2020, after 139 years of production, Norfolk Southern shut down its locomotive shops and moved all operations to the Juniata Locomotive Shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania. With Norfolk Southern&#x27;s departure, Roanoke&#x27;s economy has since the mid-1990s shifted to become dominated by the healthcare industry. 
 the city&#x27;s top employer and the largest private employer west of Richmond is Carilion Clinic, which developed from the 1987 merger of two of the area&#x27;s largest hospitals. The non-profit group employs over 13,000 people. It operates nine hospitals in Western Virginia, along with public-private partnerships with Virginia Tech (Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute) and Radford University (Radford University Carilion). The clinic&#x27;s expansions have spurred considerable development in the former brownfields located south of Roanoke&#x27;s downtown, turning the once-abandoned industrial sites into an area called the &quot;innovation corridor&quot; by the city.

Another driving factor in the region&#x27;s economy has been a push during the 21st century to market the area&#x27;s outdoor recreation potential. The Roanoke Regional Partnership, an economic development group representing the area&#x27;s municipalities, has created a division called the Roanoke Outside Foundation that seeks to recruit businesses and talent based on the strength of the region&#x27;s natural amenities. The organization also puts on annual events such as the Blue Ridge Marathon and the GO Outside Festival.

Other areas of strength in the region&#x27;s economy include manufacturing and retail, each comprising over ten percent of the valley&#x27;s industry. Transportation manufacturers such as Yokohama Tire, Volvo, Mack Trucks, Metalsa, and Altec contribute to the thousands of people employed in that field regionally. Night-vision device makers Elbit Systems and the fiber optics company Luna Innovations are among the advanced manufacturers in the area.

===Top employers===
According to Roanoke&#x27;s 2023 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

==Arts and culture==
Serving as a hub for arts and culture in Southwest Virginia, Roanoke is home to several museums and cultural institutions in addition to being the host of several festivals, many centering around Elmwood Park in downtown Roanoke.

===Museums===

Center in the Square, an arts and culture organization located near downtown&#x27;s historic market building and farmers&#x27; market, was developed alongside the city&#x27;s &quot;Design &#x27;79&quot; downtown revitalization effort and opened in 1983. The center, located in a converted warehouse, originally housed the city&#x27;s arts council and museum, history and science museums, and the Mill Mountain Theatre. It has since expanded to five buildings, providing rent-free space to twelve institutions, including the Science Museum of Western Virginia and Hopkins Planetarium, the Harrison Museum of African American Culture, and the Roanoke Pinball Museum.

One of the original tenants of Center in the Square, the Art Museum of Western Virginia, moved to a downtown Salem Avenue facility in 2008. The move was made with the help of a $15.2 million donation from Nicholas and Jenny Taubman, whose family had established Advance Auto Parts in Roanoke in the 1930s. As a result, the museum was renamed the Taubman Museum of Art. The art museum features 19th and 20th century American art, contemporary and modern art, decorative arts, and works on paper. The facility was designed by Los Angeles-based architect Randall Stout, who earlier in his career worked under Frank Gehry. Though the building&#x27;s avant-garde design was controversial, it has since won international praise for its architecture.
Also located downtown is the Virginia Museum of Transportation, which houses many locomotives that were built in Roanoke by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, including the 1218 and 611 steam engines. A 2013 fundraising campaign led to the engine&#x27;s refurbishment, and it now does tourist excursion runs when not home at the museum. In addition to its rail exhibits, the museum also displays a US Army Jupiter rocket and houses exhibits covering aviation as well as automobiles. The museum is located in the former Norfolk and Western freight depot which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The former Norfolk and Western Passenger Station hosts two museums: the O. Winston Link Museum, dedicated to the late steam-era railroad photography of O. Winston Link, and the History Museum of Western Virginia. Originally built in 1905, the station underwent a 1949 renovation in the Moderne style by designer Raymond Loewy, and is one of four contributing structures to the Norfolk and Western Railway Company Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Arts===
The Berglund Performing Arts Theatre is a 2,150-seat venue within the larger Berglund Center complex. It regularly hosts concerts, touring Broadway theatre performances, stand-up comedy shows, and the Miss Virginia pageant. The city&#x27;s first permanent artwork funded by the Percent for Art ordinance a law stating that the city must set aside 1% of its capital improvements budget for the purchasing of public art stands before the theater. Dedicated in 2008 to celebrate the city&#x27;s 150th anniversary, the stainless steel sculpture, &quot;In My Hands&quot;, is one of over 160 public works of art in Roanoke.

The Jefferson Center is a former city high school that saw extensive renovation during the 1990s, turning it into a mixed-use building including office space for non-profits and city departments, event space for meetings and receptions, and the Shaftman Performance Hall, a 925-seat theatre created from the original high school&#x27;s auditorium.

In 2006, the former Dumas Hotel was reopened as the Dumas Center for Artistic and Cultural Development. The center is located on Henry Street, which served as the commercial and cultural center of Roanoke&#x27;s African-American community before a mid-20th century urban renewal project that saw much of the historic Gainsboro neighborhood razed or relocated. The Dumas Hotel hosted such guests as Louis Armstrong, Ethel Waters, Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Nat King Cole when they performed in Roanoke. The renovated Dumas Center features an auditorium with more than 200 seats, and the building is a contributing structure to the Henry Street Historic District, listed in 2004 to the National Register of Historic Places.

Since 1964, the Roanoke Valley has hosted performances by the Mill Mountain Theatre, a regional theatre that has been located in Center in the Square since its original home atop Mill Mountain burned down in 1976. The theatre has both a main stage for mainstream performances and a smaller black box theatre called Waldron Stage, which hosts both newer and more experimental plays along with other live events.

Roanoke has been home to the Showtimers Community Theatre since 1951, and since 2008, the Virginia Children&#x27;s Theatre has presented shows aimed at a younger audience, often based on children&#x27;s literature. Originally formed as Roanoke Children&#x27;s Theatre and housed in the Taubman Museum at that building&#x27;s opening, the theatre expanded into the Dumas Center in 2013, and in 2016 moved to its current home in the Jefferson Center.

Opera Roanoke is Southwest Virginia&#x27;s only professional opera company, established in 1976 as the Southwest Virginia Opera Society. It has performed under its current name since 1991, and its official orchestra since 2004 has been the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra. That group was established in 1953. The orchestra performs out of the Berglund Performing Arts Theatre, Salem Civic Center, and Shaftman Performance Hall at Jefferson Center.

===Points of interest===
Roanoke is the largest metropolitan area on the Blue Ridge Parkway, a 469-mile-long scenic road that is the most-visited element of the National Park System. The Mill Mountain Parkway exit off of the Blue Ridge Parkway leads to the Roanoke Star, an illuminated star sitting atop a mountain inside the city&#x27;s limits. Also on the mountain&#x27;s summit is Mill Mountain Zoo, a Zoological Association of America-accredited facility housing over 170 animals.

The Basilica of St. Andrew rests on a hill overlooking downtown and has been called &quot;one of Virginia&#x27;s foremost examples of the High Victorian Gothic&quot;. The church dates to 1900, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1973. Just below the church lies the Hotel Roanoke, a historic 330-room Tudor Revival hotel originally built by the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1882 and rebuilt and expanded many times since. Nicknamed the &quot;Grand Old Lady&quot;, the hotel was listed on the NRHP in 1995.

A pedestrian bridge leads from the Hotel Roanoke to the city&#x27;s historic market building and farmers&#x27; market, the latter of which dates to 1882 and is the oldest continuously operating open-air market in Virginia. Near the terminus of the market is Fire Station No. 1, which for a time was the oldest continuously operating station in the state. The Georgian Revival structure was listed on the NRHP in 1973, and currently houses a local furniture showroom, restaurant, and boutique hotel. Two blocks west on the same street is Texas Tavern, an &quot;iconic&quot; ten-seat greasy spoon restaurant that the same family has operated since its establishment in 1930.

===Festivals===

Roanoke features several annual festivals and events of various types. A parade for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day occurs every March, and Pride in the Park is an LGBTQ+ community celebration that draws thousands of visitors every April. Several events occur in May, including the Local Colors festival celebrating the cultures of the area&#x27;s diverse ethnicities, the city&#x27;s Strawberry Festival, the Down by Downtown music festival which coincides with the Blue Ridge Marathon, and Memorial Day weekend&#x27;s Festival in the Park, which brings music and vendors to downtown Elmwood Park.

Later in the year, Elmwood Park hosts the Henry Street Heritage Festival, the primary fundraiser for the Harrison Museum of African American Culture. The event&#x27;s popularity necessitated the move from its eponymous location. The Go Outside Festival, also known as GO Fest, is a free three-day event every October that celebrates the region&#x27;s outdoor recreation opportunities, and the city holds the multi-week Dickens of a Christmas each December. This Victorian era-themed event includes a Christmas tree lighting, parade, and horse-drawn carriage rides through downtown.

==Sports==
The 1971–1972 Virginia Squires of the American Basketball Association were the only major league sports team to play home games in Roanoke regularly. During that season, the Squires split home games between Richmond, Norfolk, Hampton Roads and Roanoke. Julius Erving played his professional rookie season with the Squires that year before being sent to the New York Nets.

Minor league baseball has had a long history in the Roanoke Valley. In the 1940s and early 1950s, Roanoke was home to a class B farm team of the Boston Red Sox. Since 1955, neighboring Salem has hosted the local minor league baseball team, which is the Salem Red Sox of the Low-A Carolina League. The team had previously been affiliated with the Houston Astros and Colorado Rockies and known as the Avalanche until becoming an affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, whose ownership group purchased the Avalanche after the 2007 season.

The history of minor league hockey in the Roanoke Valley goes back to 1967. The Roanoke Express of the ECHL built a loyal following in the mid-1990s, but a combination of financial turmoil due to mismanagement and declining attendance from a lack of post-season success led to the ECHL ending their franchise in 2004. An attempt at a revival in 2005–06 by the UHL&#x27;s Roanoke Valley Vipers failed after one season. In 2016, professional ice hockey returned to Roanoke after ten years when the Roanoke Rail Yard Dawgs of the SPHL began to play, and the team won its first-ever President&#x27;s Cup title in 2023.

While the Roanoke area is not home to any NCAA Division I schools, its proximity to Virginia Tech has led it to host some collegiate athletic events. Beginning in 1977, Roanoke, along with Richmond, was one of the primary neutral sites for the annual basketball game between Virginia Tech and the Virginia Cavaliers. In 2000 the schools started holding these games in campus facilities.

From 1913, Roanoke played host to an annual football game between Virginia Tech and the Virginia Military Institute, first at Maher Field and then in the newly constructed Victory Stadium starting in 1942. The game was moved to Thanksgiving Day beginning in the early 1920s and was a holiday mainstay in the city until 1971.

Roanoke&#x27;s location among the Blue Ridge Mountains makes it a destination for other sporting events. Every year since 2010 (barring 2020, when it was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the Roanoke Outside Foundation has put on the Blue Ridge Marathon, which is regarded as difficult due to its considerable elevation changes. The USA Cycling Amateur Road National Championships were held in the city and surrounding areas in 2022 and 2023, and an Ironman 70.3 triathlon event brought competitors to the region from 20212023.

==Parks and recreation==
There are 60 parks within Roanoke&#x27;s city limits, and its parks and recreation department is responsible for nearly 14,000 acres of public land. Highland Park in the historic Old Southwest neighborhood is the city&#x27;s oldest, having been purchased in 1902 when the former farm was still distant from the settled part of the city. Elmwood Park in downtown Roanoke became the city&#x27;s second in 1911. It features a Japanese magnolia tree that was acquired by Commodore Matthew Perry during an expedition to Japan and donated in 1857 to the former owner of the park. Elmwood holds the city&#x27;s main library branch as well as an art walk and a 4,000-seat amphitheater.

Roanoke features an extensive network of paved greenways for walkers, runners, and cyclists. Though the idea for a publicly owned greenway system can be traced back to a 1907 comprehensive plan for the city, it was not until 1995 that an intergovernmental committee was formed to plan and develop the project. Since that time, of greenways have been built across the Roanoke Valley. the longest continuous stretch runs along the Roanoke River from Salem through Roanoke City to Vinton. Roanoke County is also in the planning stages of extending that same stretch westward into Montgomery County. Roanoke contained over of trails and greenways.

==Government==













Like most cities in Virginia, Roanoke has a council-manager form of government. The city manager maintains the day-to-day operation of the city&#x27;s government and has the authority to hire and fire city employees. The mayor has little executive authority and is essentially the &quot;first among equals&quot; on the Roanoke City Council, though the position wields influence through public appearances and annual State of the City addresses.

The city council has six members, not counting the mayor, all of whom are elected on an at-large basis. A proposal for a ward-based council was rejected by Roanoke voters in 1997, but ward system advocates still contend that the at-large system results in a disproportionate number of council members coming from affluent neighborhoods and that electing some or all council members on a ward basis would result in a more equal representation of all areas of the city. The four-year terms of city council members are staggered, with three members elected every two years. The candidate who receives the most votes is designated the vice mayor for the following two years.

On June 27, 2016, Sherman P. Lea Sr. took the office of mayor, and he was re-elected to the same position in 2020. The current city manager, Bob Cowell, has been in that position since 2017. Joseph L. Cobb is serving his second term as the city&#x27;s vice mayor.

The city has adopted a budget for the 2024 fiscal year that includes revenues and expenditures totaling $355.4 million, representing a 9.4% increase over the previous year. Local taxes, including real estate, personal property, and sales taxes, are the government&#x27;s largest source of revenue at over 70% of its intake.

Roanoke is represented by two members of the Virginia House of Delegates, Sam Rasoul (D-11th) and Chris Head (R-17th), and one member of the Virginia Senate, John Edwards (D-21st). In February 2023, Edwards announced his intention to retire after 28 years in the state senate. The city lies within , which also includes Lynchburg and much of the Shenandoah Valley. Since 2019 the district has been represented by Republican Ben Cline.

Roanoke is one of the few Democratic pockets in the otherwise heavily Republican Southwest Virginia. It has supported the Democratic Party nominee in every election since 1988 and in all but one election since 1976.

==Education==
Two four-year private institutions are situated in neighboring localities – Roanoke College in the city of Salem, and Hollins University in Roanoke County. Virginia Tech and Radford University&#x27;s main campuses are located in the nearby New River Valley, and both of those schools have partnered with Carilion Clinic, the regional nonprofit health care organization based in Roanoke, to create medical colleges in the city. Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute was founded in 2007, and Radford University Carilion was established in 2019. The Roanoke Higher Education Center opened in 2000 in the former Norfolk and Western General Office BuildingNorth, and provides over 150 programs ranging from high school equivalent degrees to doctorates. Virginia Western Community College is located in the city and provides associate degrees as well as facilitated transfers to many four-year colleges in the area. ECPI University, a private for-profit institution, also has a campus located in Roanoke.

The local public school division is Roanoke City Public Schools. The two general enrollment public high schools in the city are Patrick Henry High School, located in the Raleigh Court area, and William Fleming High School, located in Northwest Roanoke.

A prominent parochial school in the city is Roanoke Catholic, which dates to 1889 and shares its campus with the Basilica of St. Andrew. Private non-parochial schools in Roanoke include Community High School of Arts and Academics. The school was first housed in the Jefferson Center before moving to its current location in downtown Roanoke in 2011.

==Media==

The city&#x27;s daily newspaper, &quot;The Roanoke Times&quot;, has been published since 1886. weekday and Sunday circulation both average around 25,000. In 2013 the paper was sold to Berkshire Hathaway, which in turn sold its BH Media holdings &quot;The Roanoke Times&quot; included to Lee Enterprises in 2020. Beth Macy, author of the bestselling book &quot;Dopesick&quot; which was adapted into a 2021 Hulu miniseries of the same name, was a reporter at &quot;The Roanoke Times&quot; for 25 years. &quot;The Roanoke Star&quot; and &quot;Cardinal News&quot; are independent digital newspapers that have sought to fill the local news coverage gap resulting from the purchase of &quot;The Roanoke Times&quot; by an out-of-state publisher and its subsequent reduction in staff.

The weekly &quot;Roanoke Tribune&quot; covers the city&#x27;s African-American community. The publication was founded in 1939 by the Rev. Fleming Alexander and since 1971 has been owned and edited by his daughter. &quot;The Roanoker&quot; is the area&#x27;s bi-monthly lifestyle magazine and has been published since 1972 by Leisure Publishing, which also puts out the bi-monthly &quot;Blue Ridge Country&quot; magazine.

Roanoke and Lynchburg are grouped in the same television market, which ranks #71 in the United States with 456,390 households. The city has affiliates for all major networks including NBC affiliate WSLS 10, CBS affiliate WDBJ 7, Fox affiliate WFXR Fox, PBS affiliate WBRA-TV, and ION Television affiliate WPXR-TV. The Roanoke-Lynchburg radio market has a population of 451,600 and is ranked number 122 in the United States . iHeartMedia owns many stations in the area, including WROV, WJJS, WYYD, and WSTV.

The reality television show &quot;Salvage Dawgs&quot; was based out of Roanoke. The show, which ran for 11 seasons on the DIY Network, followed the owners and employees of the architectural salvage company Black Dog Salvage as they located and acquired pieces for their store. Some of the company&#x27;s projects in Roanoke itself were highlighted on the show, including their part in the renovation of Fire Station No. 1.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Interstate 581, the primary north–south roadway in the city, connects Roanoke to Interstate 81 to the north. Interstate 581 is a concurrency with U.S. Route 220, which continues as the Roy L. Webber Expressway from downtown Roanoke, where the I-581 designation ends, south to State Route 419. Route 220 continues south to connect Roanoke to Martinsville, Virginia, and Greensboro, North Carolina; a proposed extension of Interstate 73 into Roanoke from North Carolina, running partially concurrent with and parallel to US 220, has long been stalled due to funding issues.

The primary east–west roadway through the city is U.S. Route 460, named Melrose Avenue and Orange Avenue. Route 460 connects Roanoke to Lynchburg to the east and Christiansburg to the west. U.S. Route 11 passes through the city, primarily as Brandon Avenue and Williamson Road, which was a center of automotive-based commercial development after World War II. Other major roads include U.S. Route 221, State Route 117 (known as Peters Creek Road) and State Route 101 (known as Hershberger Road). The Blue Ridge Parkway also briefly runs adjacent to the city border.

The Roanoke–Blacksburg Regional Airport is located in the northern part of the city. It is the primary passenger and cargo airport for Southwest Virginia. The airport is served by American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta and Allegiant Air. Due to the facility&#x27;s size, location in the mountains, and proximity to Andrews Air Force Base, it is often used as a pilot training destination for the Special Air Mission fleet that serves as Air Force One and Two when the nation&#x27;s leaders are aboard.

While Roanoke is known for its rail history, low ridership numbers led Amtrak to discontinue passenger rail service to the city in 1979. Beginning in 2011, Roanoke funded a bus service, the Smart Way Connector, to connect riders to the Amtrak station in Lynchburg as well as to show Amtrak that there was once again a demand for the service in Roanoke. In August 2013, it was announced that Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; service would be extended from Lynchburg by 2017. On October 31, 2017, after 38 years without passenger rail service, Amtrak resumed service to Roanoke. The service has been successful enough that a second daily train to Roanoke was added in 2022.

Despite Norfolk Southern&#x27;s relocation of its corporate headquarters out of the city, Roanoke is still a major hub in the company&#x27;s freight rail system. The railway&#x27;s Pocahontas Division, consisting of over of track, is headquartered just outside of downtown Roanoke, and though the volume of coal passing through the city has declined in recent decades, 70 million tons of freight are shipped on the area&#x27;s railroads annually.

The Valley Metro provides bus service to the city of Roanoke and surrounding areas. In June 2023, the service began operating out of a new facility on Third Street in downtown Roanoke, built to replace the aging Campbell Court station. Valley Metro also offers bus service to Blacksburg, Christiansburg and Virginia Tech via its Smart Way service, as well as the Ferrum Express, a free shuttle that runs between downtown Roanoke and Ferrum College in nearby Rocky Mount.

The 21st century has seen Roanoke put considerable resources towards improving its cycling infrastructure. In addition to its extensive paved greenway network, Roanoke has added 43 miles of marked bike lanes along its major roads. In recent years, the city has put millions of dollars towards pedestrian safety improvements, including lane reductions on busy roads, audible signals, and additional street lighting. Roanoke is served by RIDE Solutions, a regional transportation demand management agency that provides carpool matching, cycling advocacy, transit assistance and remote work assistance to businesses and citizens in the region.

=== Utilities ===
Roanoke is supplied electricity by the Appalachian Power Company, an American Electric Power division. Appalachian Power serves roughly 500,000 people in Western Virginia and another 500,000 in West Virginia and Tennessee. The area&#x27;s water and wastewater operations are managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority. That organization was founded in 2004 with the consolidation of the water utilities of Roanoke City and Roanoke County, under the logic that the location of watersheds should determine the management of local resources rather than government boundaries. The Water Authority has since taken on the water-based utilities of Franklin and Botetourt Counties as well as the towns of Boones Mill and Vinton.

=== Healthcare ===
Roanoke is the primary center for healthcare in Western Virginia, serving an estimated one million people. Carilion Clinic, a non-profit healthcare group, is the region&#x27;s largest provider with over 750 physicians spread across eight hospitals. The region is also served by the Lewis-Gale Medical Center, a 521-bed facility established in Roanoke in 1911 and now located in Salem, as well as a Veterans Affairs Medical Center serving over 100,000 military veterans in the region, also located in Salem.

==Notable people==
==Sister cities==

* Florianópolis, Brazil
* Kisumu, Kenya
* Lijiang, China
* Opole, Poland
* Saint-Lô, France
* Wonju, South Korea

<text>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is one of the United States Department of Energy national laboratories, managed by the Department of Energy&#x27;s (DOE) Office of Science. The main campus of the laboratory is in Richland, Washington, with additional research facilities around the country.

Originally named the Pacific Northwest Laboratory, PNL was established in 1965 when research and development at the Hanford Site was separated from other Hanford operations. In 1995, the laboratory was renamed the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

==Research facilities==

The Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) is a U.S. Department of Energy national scientific user facility. EMSL provides researchers around the world with integrated capabilities in oxide and mineral interface chemistry, high-performance computing and computational chemistry software, mass spectrometry, high-field magnetic resonance, and subsurface flow and transport research.

The Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Laboratory (BSEL) is a joint effort between Washington State University and PNNL, and is located on the WSU-Tri-Cities campus. Within BSEL, researchers are developing technology for converting agricultural byproducts into chemicals for products like plastics, solvents, fibers, pharmaceuticals, and fuel additives.

Researchers at PNNL&#x27;s Radiochemical Processing Laboratory are developing processes to advance the cleanup of radiological and hazardous wastes; the processing and disposal of nuclear fuels; and the production and delivery of medical isotopes.
Three research facilities were constructed on PNNL&#x27;s Richland, Washington campus to partially replace laboratory and office space PNNL had been using on the south end of the nearby Hanford Site.

The Physical Sciences Facility, a federally funded research complex, houses research in materials science, radiation detection, and ultra-trace analysis.
The privately funded Computational Sciences Facility and Biological Sciences Facility house about 310 staff who support PNNL&#x27;s energy, environmental, national security, and fundamental science research missions. These two new facilities opened in 2009. The CSF contains scientific capabilities in information analytics, high-performance computing, cyber security and bioinformatics. The BSF focuses on bioenergy, environmental and soil remediation and includes systems biology, microbial and cellular biology and analytical interfacial chemistry.

The Electricity Infrastructure Operations Center at PNNL combines software, real-time power grid data and computation into a control room setting. The ideas and technologies developed in the EIOC address better management of the power grid. The EIOC also is available to utilities, vendors, government agencies and universities interested in research, development or training.

PNNL-Sequim (2022–present), previously known as the Marine and Coastal Research Laboratory (2021) and the Marine Sciences Laboratory (1966–2021), located at Sequim, Washington, is the DOE&#x27;s only marine laboratory. PNNL-Sequim provides analytical and general-purpose laboratories, as well as wet or support laboratories supplied with heated and cooled freshwater and seawater. More than 20 engineers and scientists work on coastal restoration and security projects, from reviving salmon habitat to research on how shellfish could detect a bioterrorist attack. PNNL-Sequim also operates a research vessel.

Other PNNL research facilities include the following:
* Research Aircraft 
* Joint Global Change Research Institute
* Shallow underground laboratory for low-activity radiation measurement

==Awards and honors==
PNNL staff have received numerous awards and recognition. These achievements include 126 R&amp;D100 Awards, 102 Federal Laboratory Consortium Awards, seven E. O. Lawrence Awards, and two Department of Energy Office of Science Distinguished Scientist Fellowships. PNNL staff serve as editors-in-chief for scientific journals, hold office in national and international technical societies, and have been granted Guggenheim fellowships, Humboldt Research Awards, and society medals. Staff have been elected to the rank of fellow in national societies including, but not limited to, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Physical Society, the Materials Research Society, and the American Chemical Society.

==History==

PNNL was established in 1965 but traces its origins to World War II, in the establishment of the Hanford Site in 1943. Plutonium production for the Manhattan Project required extensive research and development activities at the Hanford Site. The General Electric Company began operating the site in 1946 and consolidated R&amp;D into the new Hanford Laboratory in 1953. After GE ended its contract in 1963 to avoid conflicts with its growing commercial nuclear business, the Atomic Energy Commission split the Hanford contract among several organizations, awarding the laboratory contract to Ohio-based Battelle Memorial Institute. Battelle took over operations on January 4, 1965, and named it the Pacific Northwest Laboratory.

Initially, PNL&#x27;s research emphasized nuclear energy and non-destructive uses for nuclear materials, including the design for the Fast Flux Test Facility to test fuels and materials for the AEC&#x27;s commercial nuclear power program. However, PNL scientists and engineers also worked on nongovernment projects. Jim Russell patented a method for optical digital recording and playback, eventually used in compact discs and digital video discs, while a Senior Scientist at PNL in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1969, NASA chose PNL to measure the concentration of both solar and galactic cosmic-ray-produced radionuclides in lunar material collected from the entire Apollo program.

In the 1970s, PNL expanded into energy, environment, health and national security research. The shift occurred as the AEC was replaced by the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1974 and the Department of Energy in 1977. During this period, researchers at PNL developed vitrification, a process to lock hazardous waste inside glass, and an acoustic holography technique allowing medical personnel to view internal organs, detect fetal abnormalities, and locate blood clots without an operation.

In the 1980s, PNL researchers introduced the first portable blood irradiator for leukemia treatments, and worked with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle under a cooperative research and development agreement to develop safe and effective protocols for its use. In the mid-1980s, PNL became one of the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s multiprogram laboratories.
In 1995, the laboratory was renamed the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The Laboratory&#x27;s global environmental and nuclear nonproliferation work moved to the forefront during the 1990s. The Pacific Northwest Center for Global Security was established to coordinate nuclear nonproliferation programs, research and policy work within the Laboratory and throughout the region. The Material Identification System and the Ultrasonic Pulse Echo instrument, technologies developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, were provided to customs inspectors in Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union republics to reduce smuggling and terrorism. Researchers also studied global climate models, including cloud formation and radiative properties of clouds. In addition, the Laboratory created energy efficiency centers to promote economic growth while mitigating its harmful effects and participating on the United Nations panel on climate change assessments.

In 2007, more than 20 PNNL scientists were recognized for their contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize in equal parts with former Vice President Al Gore.

Technologies to counter acts of terrorism have progressed at PNNL in this decade with the expansion of radiation portal monitoring technology developed at the Laboratory. This technology is used at ports of entry around the country to scan for and detect the presence of nuclear and radiological materials. In 2004, The U.S. Department of Homeland Security established the National Visualization and Analytics Center (NVAC) to advance visualization research using computer technology to enable humans to visually synthesize and derive insight from massive amounts of information to help the nation predict and respond to manmade and natural disasters and terrorist incidents.

PNNL scientists are designing catalysts to use solar energy to power reactions that turn water into hydrogen. They are incorporating the concepts of energy matching and proton relays to design inexpensive nickel and cobalt containing molecular complexes that catalyze that reaction. DOE has awarded $22.5 million over five years for PNNL&#x27;s new Center for Molecular Electrocatalysis, where scientists will study catalysts that convert electrical energy into chemical bonds and back again.

<text>Roanoke College is a private liberal arts college in Salem, Virginia. It has approximately 2,000 students who represent approximately 40 states and 30 countries. The college offers 35 majors, 57 minors and concentrations, and pre-professional programs. Roanoke awards bachelor&#x27;s degrees in arts, science, and business administration and is one of 280 colleges with a chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.

Roanoke is an NCAA Division III school competing in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference. The college fields varsity teams in eleven men&#x27;s and ten women&#x27;s sports. Roanoke&#x27;s athletic nickname is Maroons and the mascot is Rooney, a maroon-tailed hawk.

==History==
===Early years===
A boys&#x27; preparatory school was founded by Lutheran pastors David F. Bittle and Christopher C. Baughmann. Originally located in Augusta County near Staunton, the school was named Virginia Institute until chartered on January 30, 1845, as Virginia Collegiate Institute. In 1847, the institute moved to Salem which was developing into a center of commerce and transportation in the region; the school moved all of its possessions in a single covered wagon. The Virginia General Assembly granted a college charter on March 14, 1853 and approved the name Roanoke College, chosen in honor of the Roanoke Valley. Bittle then served as the college&#x27;s first president.

Roanoke was one of the few Southern colleges that remained open throughout the American Civil War. The student body was organized into a corps of cadets and fought with Confederate forces near Salem in December 1863. The students were outmatched and quickly forced to surrender, but the Union commander paroled them and allowed them to return to their studies. The college company was formally mustered into the Confederate Army, Virginia Reserves, on September 1, 1864, but the students did not see combat before the war ended.

===International students===

Roanoke enrolled its first international students in the late 19th century; the first Mexican student in 1876 and the first Japanese student in 1888. The first Korean to graduate from an American college or university, Surh Beung Kiu, graduated in 1898.

===Coeducation===

Roanoke became coeducational in 1930. A small number of non-degree-seeking women, mostly from Elizabeth College in Salem, were previously enrolled. Originally named Roanoke Women&#x27;s College, Elizabeth was a sister Lutheran women&#x27;s college destroyed by fire in 1921 and closed; the female students finished the 1921–22 academic year at Roanoke.

Roanoke opened its first women&#x27;s residence hall, Smith Hall, in 1941; it has a prominent position on the John R. Turbyfill Front Quad. The Roanoke Women&#x27;s College campus is its Elizabeth Campus, located approximately two miles from the Roanoke main campus.

Roanoke adopted the alumnae of Marion College, a sister Lutheran women&#x27;s college in Marion, Virginia, when it closed in 1967. Marion Hall, a residence hall constructed in 1968, honors the college and its alumnae.

===National championships===

Roanoke athletic teams have won two national championships: the 1972 NCAA College Division men&#x27;s basketball championship and the 1978 Division II men&#x27;s lacrosse championship. Roanoke&#x27;s third national championship occurred in 2001 when student Casey Smith won an individual championship in the Division III women&#x27;s 10,000m track and field event. In 2009, student Robin Yerkes secured Roanoke&#x27;s fourth national championship when she won an individual championship in the Division III women&#x27;s 400m track and field event.

===Sesquicentennial===

Roanoke experienced exceptional growth in the 1980s and 1990s. Two campaign plans, the 1992 Sesquicentennial Campaign and the 2002 Plan, also known as &quot;The Difference&quot;, were successfully completed with over $150 million raised. The campaigns financed the renovation and construction of numerous facilities including the library, the student center, and the arts and performance center.

Roanoke&#x27;s tenth president, and first female president, Sabine O&#x27;Hara, took office in 2004.

==Lutheran heritage==

Established in 1842, Roanoke is the second-oldest (Gettysburg College is the oldest) Lutheran-affiliated college in the United States and is associated with three synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America: the Virginia Synod, the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Synod, and the West Virginia–Western Maryland Synod. The Virginia Synod is headquartered in Bittle Hall, the college&#x27;s first library now occupied by the Bishop of the Virginia Synod.

Historically, the college has had a small Lutheran population. Roanoke&#x27;s student body represents numerous religious denominations; Roman Catholicism is the most prevalent, and Lutherans total less than ten percent.

==Student life==
===Student organizations===

Roanoke has over 100 student organizations that provide learning experiences outside the classroom. Students may choose from academic, cultural, religious, service, and social organizations including nine Greek organizations.

The Student Government Association at Roanoke exists to give students a voice in the administration. It is the highest level student organization. It is made up of an executive board (President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Attorney General) and the Senate (41 members).

Student publications and media opportunities include the &quot;Brackety-Ack&quot; campus newspaper, a literary magazine titled &quot;On Concept&#x27;s Edge&quot;, the &quot;Roanoke Review&quot; literary journal, and the student-operated radio station named WRKE-LP. Intramural sports are also offered.

===Greek life===

Roanoke has recognized chapters of nine social and two service Greek organizations. The Greek organizations operate in college-owned housing. Roanoke&#x27;s original fraternity row has been converted into residence halls. Roanoke&#x27;s Greek organizations have a prominent role on campus, but are not dominant; approximately 25% of the Roanoke student body participates in Greek life.

==Campus==

===Quadrangles===
Roanoke&#x27;s main campus is relatively self-contained with most academic buildings and residence halls built around three quadrangles: the John R. Turbyfill Front Quad, the Back Quad (central campus), and the Athletic Quad, which surrounds the college&#x27;s newest athletic facilities and residence halls. The campus is lined with brick sidewalks and has been recognized for its landscaping and views of the surrounding mountains. The largest Rock Elm in the United States is located near the library. The only Alice Aycock sculpture in Virginia is on the Back Quad.

===Architecture===

The campus architecture is a blend of traditional collegiate and modern styles. The Administration Building, constructed in 1848 with bricks made on-site, and six other buildings, Miller Hall, Trout Hall, Bittle Hall, Monterey House, West Hall, and the Old Salem Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===National Register of Historic Places===
Seven college buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The buildings, with year of construction, are:
* The Administration Building (1848) 
* Miller Hall (1857) 
* Trout Hall (1867) 
* Bittle Hall (1879) 
* Monterey House (1853)
* West Hall (former Roanoke County Courthouse) (1910) 
* The Post Office (former Salem city post office) (1923)

===Residence halls===

Approximately 70% of the student body resides on campus.

===President&#x27;s House===

The President&#x27;s House is in a residential district approximately one-half-mile north of the Roanoke campus on North Market Street. The colonial revival mansion, one of the largest private homes in the area, was constructed in the late 1930s. It was purchased in the mid-1950s by John P. Fishwick, president of the Norfolk and Western Railway and a Roanoke &amp; Harvard Law School alumnus, and was acquired by the college in 1968.

In April 2011, the President&#x27;s House and its garden were opened to the public during Virginia&#x27;s Historic Garden Week. Selection of sites to participate is very competitive; only five Roanoke Valley residences were featured in 2011.

===Elizabeth Campus===

Additional college facilities, mostly residence halls and athletic fields, are located on the site of Elizabeth College, a Lutheran women&#x27;s college that closed in 1922. The area, approximately two miles east of the main campus, is referred to as Elizabeth Campus. Houses for Kappa Alpha Order, Pi Kappa Alpha, Pi Lambda Phi and Sigma Chi are on Elizabeth Campus along with Elizabeth Hall, a large residence hall with apartments for non-freshman students.

===College Avenue – Main Street===
Roanoke acquired three office buildings on College Avenue across from West Hall in 2005–06. The buildings have been renovated to provide classroom and office space for various college departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://roanoke.edu/x19936.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With the acquisitions, the Roanoke campus occupies both sides of College Avenue from Main Street north to the traditional campus entrance.

In 2013, Roanoke purchased two Main Street buildings: the Bank Building, located on the corner of College Avenue and Main Street across from West Hall, and the Old Salem Post Office, located on the corner of Main and Market Streets. Roanoke had leased the bank building for several years preceding the purchase and will continue to use it for academic purposes. The post office building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is the seventh building on the Roanoke campus listed on the national register; it will be renovated for academic use.

===Recent construction===

Roanoke opened a new 200-bed residence hall in 2012; the building, the college&#x27;s second LEED-certified building, completes the third quadrangle along with Kerr Stadium and Caldwell, Beamer, and Ritter Halls. The college previously completed an eight-court competition tennis complex on the Elizabeth Campus and a large parking lot on the main campus; the projects replaced existing facilities and made land available for the new residence hall. In addition, McClanahan Hall on the Elizabeth Campus reopened in 2012 as the Sigma Chi house; the Sigma Chi house on the main campus was razed and is now green space.

Roanoke&#x27;s most recent major project opened in 2016; the Morris M. Cregger Center is a multi-purpose athletic and recreation center with a 2,500 seat performance arena (basketball and volleyball), a 200-meter indoor track and field facility, athletic department and faculty offices, classrooms, fitness facilities, and a sports medicine clinic. The center is on the north side of campus; Bowman Hall, a large residence hall that opened in 1965, was razed to make land available. Kerr Stadium was incorporated as a part of the western facade so the two facilities form a unified complex; the center overlooks the stadium.

Roanoke, in anticipation of future growth, has purchased a significant number of private homes on Market Street adjacent to campus, which will provide land for expansion.

==Athletics==
Roanoke athletic teams are the Maroons. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) since the 1976–77 academic year. 

Roanoke competes in 23 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor), volleyball (starting in 2022–23) and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

The college&#x27;s athletic colors are maroon and gray. Roanoke is particularly noted for the strength of its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse programs and women&#x27;s track and field.

In June 2023, it was announced that Roanoke would be reinstating the college&#x27;s football program, which has not played since 1942. The Maroons will begin play as NCAA Division III Independents in 2024 becoming full ODAC members in 2025.

===Accomplishments===
;National championships:

Roanoke teams have won two national championships: the 1972 NCAA College Division men&#x27;s basketball championship and the 1978 Division II men&#x27;s lacrosse championship. In 2001, Roanoke student Casey Smith won an individual national championship in the Division III women&#x27;s 10,000m track and field event. In 2009, student Robin Yerkes secured Roanoke&#x27;s fourth national championship when she won an individual championship in the Division III women&#x27;s 400m track and field event. Yerkes is the most decorated athlete ever to graduate from Roanoke, earning 12 All-American honors in multiple events.

;Conference championships:

Roanoke teams have won 101 conference championships as of May 2013 (47 in men&#x27;s sports, 54 in women&#x27;s sports) since the college joined the ODAC as a founding member in 1976. Roanoke has won more conference championships than any other ODAC school in men&#x27;s lacrosse with 18 titles and women&#x27;s basketball with 13 titles. Roanoke, Hampden–Sydney College, and Randolph-Macon College are tied for the most conference championships in men&#x27;s basketball with 10 titles each.

==Notable alumni==
==Roanoke and the railway==

The Norfolk and Western Railway, now Norfolk Southern Corporation, has provided career opportunities for many Roanoke alumni; the NWR was headquartered in Roanoke until 1982 and is a major employer in western Virginia. Roanoke graduates who have advanced to leadership positions include Stuart T. Saunders and John Fishwick, former presidents of the NWR; John R. Turbyfill, retired vice-chairman, NSC; John S. Shannon, retired executive vice president, NSC; and William T. Ross Sr., retired assistant vice president, NWR.

Roanoke has strong historic ties to the railway due in part to its alumni connections. The NWR named a Pullman car &quot;Roanoke College&quot; in honor of the college and Fishwick&#x27;s Salem residence is now the college President&#x27;s House. Saunders and Turbyfill served as chairman of Roanoke&#x27;s board of trustees. In 2007, David R. Goode, retired chairman, NSC, endowed Roanoke&#x27;s Center for Learning and Teaching in honor of his father, sister, and brother-in-law, all Roanoke graduates.

<text>In the United States, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the region. Such regions are not legally incorporated as a city or town would be and are not legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states. As a result, sometimes the precise definition of a given metropolitan area will vary between sources. The statistical criteria for a standard metropolitan area were defined in 1949 and redefined as a metropolitan statistical area in 1983.

Due to suburbanization, the typical metropolitan area is polycentric rather than being centered around a large historic core city such as New York City or Chicago. Some metropolitan areas include more than one large historic core city; examples include the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport News (Hampton Roads), Riverside–San Bernardino (Inland Empire), and Minneapolis–Saint Paul (Twin Cities). 

MSAs are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is part of the Executive Office of the President, and are used by the U.S. Census Bureau and other U.S. federal government agencies for statistical purposes.

==Definitions==

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines a set of core based statistical areas (CBSAs) throughout the country, which are composed of counties and county equivalents. 

CBSAs are delineated on the basis of a central contiguous area of relatively high population density, known as an urban area. The counties containing the core urban area are known as the &quot;central counties&quot; of the CBSA; these are defined as having at least 50% of their population living in urban areas of at least 10,000 in population. Additional surrounding counties, known as &quot;outlying counties&quot;, can be included in the CBSA if these counties have strong social and economic ties to the central county or counties as measured by commuting and employment. Outlying counties are included in the CBSA if 25% of the workers living in the county work in the central county or counties, or if 25% of the employment in the county is held by workers who live in the central county or counties.

Adjacent CBSAs are merged into a single CBSA when the central county or counties of one CBSA qualify as an outlying county or counties to the other CBSAs. One or more CBSAs may be grouped together or combined to form a larger statistical entity known as a combined statistical area (CSA) when the employment interchange measure (EIM) reaches 15% or more.

CBSAs are subdivided into MSAs (formed around urban areas of at least 50,000 in population) and micropolitan statistical areas (μSAs), which are CBSAs built around an urban area of at least 10,000 in population but less than 50,000 in population. Some metropolitan areas may include multiple cities below 50,000 people, but combined have over 50,000 people. Previous terms that are no longer used to describe these regions include &quot;standard metropolitan statistical area&quot; (SMSA) and &quot;primary metropolitan statistical area&quot; (PMSA).

On January 19, 2021, OMB submitted a regulation for public comment that would increase the minimum population needed for an urban area population to be a metropolitan statistical area to be increased from 50,000 to 100,000. It ultimately decided to keep the minimum at 50,000 for the 2020 cycle.

On July 21, 2023, the Office of Management and Budget released revised delineations of the various CBSAs in the United States.

==History==

The Census Bureau created the metropolitan district for the 1910 census as a standardized classification for large urban centers and their surrounding areas. The original threshold for a metropolitan district was 200,000, but was lowered to 100,000 in 1930 and 50,000 in 1940. The metropolitan districts were replaced by standard metropolitan areas (SMAs) in the 1950 census, which were defined by the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget) and later renamed to standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMAs) in 1959. The modern metropolitan statistical area was created in 1983 amid a large increase in the number of eligible markets, which grew from 172 in 1950 to 288 in 1980; the core based statistical area (CBSA) was introduced in 2000 and defined in 2003 with a minimum population of 10,000 required for micropolitan areas and 50,000 for urban areas.

<doc id="75802" wikidata="Q1319773" url="?curid=75802" title="Consistency">
<text>In classical, deductive logic, a consistent theory is one that does not lead to a logical contradiction. A theory formula_1 is consistent if there is no formula formula_2 such that both formula_2 and its negation formula_4 are elements of the set of consequences of formula_1. Let formula_6 be a set of closed sentences (informally &quot;axioms&quot;) and formula_7 the set of closed sentences provable from formula_6 under some (specified, possibly implicitly) formal deductive system. The set of axioms formula_6 is consistent when there is no formula formula_2 such that formula_11 and formula_12. A &quot;trivial&quot; theory (i.e., one which proves every sentence in the language of the theory) is clearly inconsistent. Conversely, in an explosive formal system (e.g., classical or intuitionistic propositional or first-order logics) every inconsistent theory is trivial. Consistency of a theory is a syntactic notion, whose semantic counterpart is satisfiability. A theory is satisfiable if it has a model, i.e., there exists an interpretation under which all axioms in the theory are true. This is what &quot;consistent&quot; meant in traditional Aristotelian logic, although in contemporary mathematical logic the term &quot;satisfiable&quot; is used instead.

In a sound formal system, every satisfiable theory is consistent, but the converse does not hold. If there exists a deductive system for which these semantic and syntactic definitions are equivalent for any theory formulated in a particular deductive logic, the logic is called [[Completeness (logic)#Refutation-completeness|complete]]. The completeness of the propositional calculus was proved by Paul Bernays in 1918 and Emil Post in 1921, while the completeness of (first order) predicate calculus was proved by Kurt Gödel in 1930, and consistency proofs for arithmetics restricted with respect to the induction axiom schema were proved by Ackermann (1924), von Neumann (1927) and Herbrand (1931). Stronger logics, such as second-order logic, are not complete.

A consistency proof is a mathematical proof that a particular theory is consistent. The early development of mathematical proof theory was driven by the desire to provide finitary consistency proofs for all of mathematics as part of Hilbert&#x27;s program. Hilbert&#x27;s program was strongly impacted by the incompleteness theorems, which showed that sufficiently strong proof theories cannot prove their consistency (provided that they are consistent).

Although consistency can be proved using model theory, it is often done in a purely syntactical way, without any need to reference some model of the logic. The cut-elimination (or equivalently the normalization of the underlying calculus if there is one) implies the consistency of the calculus: since there is no cut-free proof of falsity, there is no contradiction in general.

==Consistency and completeness in arithmetic and set theory==
In theories of arithmetic, such as Peano arithmetic, there is an intricate relationship between the consistency of the theory and its completeness. A theory is complete if, for every formula φ in its language, at least one of φ or ¬φ is a logical consequence of the theory.

Presburger arithmetic is an axiom system for the natural numbers under addition. It is both consistent and complete.

Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems show that any sufficiently strong recursively enumerable theory of arithmetic cannot be both complete and consistent. Gödel&#x27;s theorem applies to the theories of Peano arithmetic (PA) and primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA), but not to Presburger arithmetic.

Moreover, Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem shows that the consistency of sufficiently strong recursively enumerable theories of arithmetic can be tested in a particular way. Such a theory is consistent if and only if it does &quot;not&quot; prove a particular sentence, called the Gödel sentence of the theory, which is a formalized statement of the claim that the theory is indeed consistent. Thus the consistency of a sufficiently strong, recursively enumerable, consistent theory of arithmetic can never be proven in that system itself. The same result is true for recursively enumerable theories that can describe a strong enough fragment of arithmetic—including set theories such as Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF). These set theories cannot prove their own Gödel sentence—provided that they are consistent, which is generally believed.

Because consistency of ZF is not provable in ZF, the weaker notion is interesting in set theory (and in other sufficiently expressive axiomatic systems). If &quot;T&quot; is a theory and &quot;A&quot; is an additional axiom, &quot;T&quot; + &quot;A&quot; is said to be consistent relative to &quot;T&quot; (or simply that &quot;A&quot; is consistent with &quot;T&quot;) if it can be proved that
if &quot;T&quot; is consistent then &quot;T&quot; + &quot;A&quot; is consistent. If both &quot;A&quot; and ¬&quot;A&quot; are consistent with &quot;T&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; is said to be independent of &quot;T&quot;.

== First-order logic ==

===Notation===
In the following context of mathematical logic, the turnstile symbol formula_13 means &quot;provable from&quot;. That is, formula_14 reads: &quot;b&quot; is provable from &quot;a&quot; (in some specified formal system).

===Definition===
*A set of formulas formula_15 in first-order logic is consistent (written formula_16) if there is no formula formula_2 such that formula_18 and formula_19. Otherwise formula_15 is inconsistent (written formula_21).
*formula_15 is said to be simply consistent if for no formula formula_2 of formula_15, both formula_2 and the negation of formula_2 are theorems of formula_15.
*formula_15 is said to be absolutely consistent or Post consistent if at least one formula in the language of formula_15 is not a theorem of formula_15.
*formula_15 is said to be maximally consistent if formula_15 is consistent and for every formula formula_2, formula_34 implies formula_35.
*formula_15 is said to contain witnesses if for every formula of the form formula_37 there exists a term formula_38 such that formula_39, where formula_40 denotes the substitution of each formula_41 in formula_2 by a formula_38; see also First-order logic.

===Basic results===
# The following are equivalent:
## formula_21
## For all formula_45
# Every satisfiable set of formulas is consistent, where a set of formulas formula_15 is satisfiable if and only if there exists a model formula_47 such that formula_48.
# For all formula_15 and formula_2:
## if not formula_51, then formula_52;
## if formula_53 and formula_18, then formula_55;
## if formula_53, then formula_57 or formula_58.
# Let formula_15 be a maximally consistent set of formulas and suppose it contains witnesses. For all formula_2 and formula_61:
## if formula_51, then formula_35,
## either formula_35 or formula_65,
## formula_66 if and only if formula_35 or formula_68,
## if formula_69 and formula_70, then formula_68,
## formula_72 if and only if there is a term formula_38 such that formula_74.

===Henkin&#x27;s theorem===
Let formula_75 be a set of symbols. Let formula_15 be a maximally consistent set of formula_75-formulas containing witnesses.

Define an equivalence relation formula_78 on the set of formula_75-terms by formula_80 if formula_81, where formula_82 denotes equality. Let formula_83 denote the equivalence class of terms containing formula_84; and let formula_85 where formula_86 is the set of terms based on the set of symbols formula_75.

Define the formula_75-structure formula_89 over formula_90, also called the term-structure corresponding to formula_15, by:

# for each formula_92-ary relation symbol formula_93, define formula_94 if formula_95
# for each formula_92-ary function symbol formula_97, define formula_98
# for each constant symbol formula_99, define formula_100

Define a variable assignment formula_101 by formula_102 for each variable formula_41. Let formula_104 be the term interpretation associated with formula_15.

Then for each formula_75-formula formula_2:

===Sketch of proof===
There are several things to verify. First, that formula_78 is in fact an equivalence relation. Then, it needs to be verified that (1), (2), and (3) are well defined. This falls out of the fact that formula_78 is an equivalence relation and also requires a proof that (1) and (2) are independent of the choice of formula_110 class representatives. Finally, formula_111 can be verified by induction on formulas.

== Model theory ==

In ZFC set theory with classical first-order logic, an inconsistent theory formula_1 is one such that there exists a closed sentence formula_2 such that formula_1 contains both formula_2 and its negation formula_116. A consistent theory is one such that the following logically equivalent conditions hold

#formula_117
#formula_118
