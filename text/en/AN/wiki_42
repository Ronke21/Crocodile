<text>Caesalpinioideae is a botanical name at the rank of subfamily, placed in the large family Fabaceae or Leguminosae. Its name is formed from the generic name &quot;Caesalpinia&quot;. It is known also as the peacock flower subfamily. The Caesalpinioideae are mainly trees distributed in the moist tropics, but include such temperate species as the honeylocust (&quot;Gleditsia triacanthos&quot;) and Kentucky coffeetree (&quot;Gymnocladus dioicus&quot;). It has the following clade-based definition:
The most inclusive crown clade containing &quot;Arcoa gonavensis&quot; and &quot;Mimosa pudica&quot; , but not &quot;Bobgunnia fistuloides&quot; , &quot;Duparquetia orchidacea&quot; , or &quot;Poeppigia procera&quot; In some classifications, for example the Cronquist system, the group is recognized at the rank of family, Caesalpiniaceae.

==Phylogenetics==
Caesalpinioideae, as it was traditionally circumscribed, was paraphyletic. Several molecular phylogenies in the early 2000s showed that the other two subfamilies of Fabaceae (Faboideae and Mimosoideae) were both nested within Caesalpinioideae. Consequently, the subfamilies of Fabaceae were reorganized to make them monophyletic. Caesalpinioideae, as currently defined, contains the following subclades:

<doc id="78823" wikidata="Q451790" url="?curid=78823" title="Eustace II, Count of Boulogne">
<text>Eustace II, (), also known as Eustace aux Grenons (&quot;Eustace with long moustaches&quot;), was Count of Boulogne from 1049 to 1087. He fought on the Norman side at the Battle of Hastings, and afterwards received large grants of land forming an honour in England. He is one of the few proven companions of William the Conqueror. It has been suggested that Eustace was the patron of the Bayeux Tapestry. His second son Godfrey of Bouillon was a preeminent leader of the First Crusade, and the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

==Origins==
Eustace was the son of Eustace I of Boulogne and Matilda of Louvain.

==Career==
Eustace&#x27;s wife was Gode, the sister of King Edward the Confessor of England. In 1047, Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine rebelled against the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry III, and Eustace joined the rebellion. Then or earlier, he repudiated Gode and married Godfrey&#x27;s daughter Ida. The next year Eustace was excommunicated by Pope Leo IX for marrying within the prohibited degree of kinship. Eustace and Ida were both descended from Louis II of France, and just within the prohibited seventh degree. However, since not all their ancestors are known, there might have existed a closer relationship. The Pope&#x27;s action was possibly at the behest of Henry III. The rebellion failed, and in 1049 Eustace and Godfrey submitted to Henry III.

Eustace visited England in 1051, and was received with honour at the court of Edward the Confessor, his former brother-in-law. Edward attempted to invest Eustace as castellan of a castle in Dover, which was met with resistance by the locals resulting in nearly forty deaths. The brawl in which Eustace and his servants became involved with the citizens of Dover led to a serious quarrel between the king and Godwin. The latter, to whose jurisdiction the men of Dover were subject, refused to punish them. His lack of respect to those in authority became the excuse for his being outlawed together with his family. They left England, but returned the next year in 1052 with a large army, aided by the Flemish.

The following years saw still further advances by Eustace&#x27;s rivals and enemies. Count Baldwin of Flanders consolidated his hold over territories he had annexed to the east. In 1060 he became tutor of his nephew King Philip I of France. In contrast Eustace&#x27;s stepson Walter of Mantes failed in his attempt to claim the County of Maine. He was captured by the Normans and died soon afterwards in mysterious circumstances.

===Battle of Hastings===

These events evidently caused a shift in Eustace&#x27;s political allegiances, for he then became an important participant in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. He fought at Hastings, although sources vary regarding the details of his conduct during the battle. The contemporary chronicler William of Poitiers wrote concerning him:

The depiction in the Bayeux Tapestry shows a knight carrying a banner who rides up to Duke William and points excitedly with his finger towards the rear of the Norman advance. William turns his head and lifts up his visor to show his knights following him that he is still alive and determined to fight on. This conforms therefore with Eustace having somewhat lost his nerve and having urged the Duke to retreat while the Battle was at its height with the outcome still uncertain. Other sources suggest that Eustace was present with William at the Malfosse incident in the immediate aftermath of the battle, where a Saxon feigning death leapt up and attacked him, and was presumably cut down before he could reach William.

Eustace received large land grants afterwards, which suggests he contributed in other ways as well, perhaps by providing ships.

==Rebellion==
In the following year, probably because he was dissatisfied with his share of the spoil, he assisted the Kentishmen in an attempt to seize Dover Castle. The conspiracy failed, and Eustace was sentenced to forfeit his English fiefs. Subsequently, he was reconciled to the Conqueror, who restored a portion of the confiscated lands.

==Death==
Eustace died &quot;circa&quot; 1087, and was succeeded by his son, Eustace III.

==Marriage and progeny==
Eustace married twice: 
*Firstly to Goda, daughter of the English king Æthelred the Unready, and sister of Edward the Confessor. Goda died circa 1047. 
*Secondly in about 1049, soon after Goda&#x27;s death, he married Ida of Lorraine, daughter of Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine. Eustace and Ida had three sons:
**Eustace III, Count of Boulogne
**Godfrey of Bouillon, Defender of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem
**Baldwin I of Jerusalem, King of Jerusalem

By his second wife, Eustace may also have had a daughter, Ida, wife of Conon, Count of Montaigu.

Eustace also had a son, Geoffrey fitz Eustace, who married Beatrice de Mandeville, daughter of Geoffrey de Mandeville. Geoffrey and Beatrice were parents of William de Boulogne and grandparents of William&#x27;s son Faramus de Boulogne.

==Cinematic depictions==
Eustace has been portrayed on screen by Leslie Bradley in the film &quot;Lady Godiva of Coventry&quot; (1955) and by Joby Blanshard in the two-part BBC TV play &quot;Conquest&quot; (1966), part of the series &quot;Theatre 625&quot;.

<doc id="78825" wikidata="Q636425" url="?curid=78825" title="Arachis">
<text>Arachis is a genus of about 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family (Fabaceae), native to South America, and was recently assigned to the informal monophyletic &quot;Pterocarpus&quot; clade of the Dalbergieae. At least one species, the peanut (&quot;Arachis hypogaea&quot;), is a major food crop species of global importance; some of the other species are cultivated for food to a small extent in South America. Other species such as &quot;A. pintoi&quot; are cultivated worldwide as forage and soil conditioner plants, with the leaves providing high-protein feed for grazing livestock and a nitrogen source in agroforestry and permaculture systems.

&quot;Arachis&quot; species, including the peanut, are used as food plants by some Lepidoptera species, including the flame shoulder, nutmeg, and turnip moth.

==Species==
&quot;Arachis&quot; comprises the following sections and species:

<text>Eustace III (c. 1050 – c. 1125) was the count of Boulogne from 1087 succeeding his father, Eustace II. He joined the First Crusade, being present at Nicaea, Dorylaeum, Antioch, and Jerusalem. After fighting in the battle of Ascalon, he returned home. Initially offered the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Eustace was at Apulia when he received news of Baldwin of Bourcq&#x27;s election to the throne. On his return to Boulogne, he founded a Cluniac monastery in Rumilly, retired as a monk, and died in 1125.

==Early life and family==
Eustace was the son of Count Eustace II and Ida of Lorraine. In 1088, he rebelled against William II of England in favour of Robert Curthose. While waiting for Robert Curthose&#x27;s arrival from Normandy, Eustace and his fellow compatriots were besieged at Rochester castle by William II. With provisions running out and the situation becoming dire within the castle, the rebels asked for terms. William II pardoned most of the rebels allowing those such as Eustace to return to Normandy. In 1091, Eustace was with Robert Curthose when the latter agreed to terms with William II, recognizing him as king of England.

Eustace married Mary, daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Eustace and Mary had a daughter, Matilda. 
==Crusade==

Eustace participated in the First Crusade of 1096 along with his brothers Godfrey (duke of Lower Lotharingia) and Baldwin. It is unclear whether he travelled eastward with his brother Godfrey&#x27;s or Robert Curthose&#x27;s army, although throughout the journey to Jerusalem, Eustace assisted Godfrey. Eustace was present at the Siege of Nicaea (May–June 1097), helped rescue Bohemund of Taranto&#x27;s beleaguered troops at the Battle of Dorylaeum (1 July 1097), defeated an enemy ambush during the Siege of Antioch, and was one of the commanders during the capture of Antioch on 3 June 1098.

Eustace, as a member of the council held at Ruj on 4 January 1099, mediated the conflict over the control of Antioch between Bohemund of Taranto and Raymond IV of Toulouse. In early December 1098, Eustace joined Raymond&#x27;s attack on Maarrat al-Nu&#x27;man and an attack on Nablus in July 1099. He gained notoriety for his actions during the Siege of Jerusalem fighting relentlessly from a siege tower along with his brother Godfrey and the crusaders they commanded. They were among the first to breach Jerusalem&#x27;s city walls and participated in the ensuing massacre. Eustace commanded a division of the crusader army during the Battle of Ascalon, and was a patron of the Knights Templar.

==Return home==
While his brothers stayed in the Holy Land, Eustace returned to administer his domains. To commemorate Eustace&#x27;s crusading adventures, the mint at Boulogne struck silver coins with a lion above the walls of Jerusalem stamped on the obverse.

When his youngest brother Baldwin I of Jerusalem died in 1118, the elderly Eustace was offered the throne. Eustace was at first uninterested, but was convinced to accept it. He traveled all the way to Apulia before learning that a distant relative, Baldwin of Bourcq, had been crowned in the meantime. 

Eustace returned to Boulogne, founded the Cluniac house of Rumilly, and retired there as a Cluniac monk. He died about 1125.

On his death the county of Boulogne was inherited by his daughter, Matilda.

<text>Eustace IV (c. 1129/1131 17 August 1153) ruled the County of Boulogne from 1146 until his death. He was the eldest son of King Stephen of England and Countess Matilda I of Boulogne. When his father seized the English throne on Henry I&#x27;s death in 1135, he became heir apparent to the English throne but predeceased his father.

==Early life==
Eustace was first mentioned in one of his parents&#x27; charters dated no later than August 1131. Stephen ascended the English throne upon the death of his uncle King Henry I, but Henry&#x27;s daughter Empress Matilda claimed the throne as well, leading to the long civil war known as the Anarchy. As heir apparent to the English throne in 1137, Eustace did homage for Normandy to King Louis VII of France; he was married to Louis&#x27;s sister Constance in 1140 when she was 16 and he was about 10 or 12. Eustace was knighted in 1147, at which date he was probably from sixteen to eighteen years of age.

==The Anarchy==

In 1151, Eustace joined his brother-in-law, Louis VII, in a raid upon Normandy, also contested between Empress Matilda and King Stephen. This was short-lived, however, when Louis accepted the homage of Henry Plantagenet, son of Empress Matilda, for Normandy. The following year, Eustace was in France as part of a wider coalition of Henry&#x27;s enemies, but Henry&#x27;s control of the duchy remained unshaken.

In the later stages of the Anarchy, Stephen was concerned with cementing Eustace as his heir without question. At a council held in London on 6 April 1152, Stephen induced a small number of barons to pay homage to Eustace as their future king; but the archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, and the other bishops declined to perform the coronation ceremony on the grounds that the Roman curia had declined Stephen&#x27;s request to use the French custom and crown Eustace in his own lifetime, opting rather they stick to English custom, thus denying Eustace his coronation. This infuriated Stephen and Eustace to such a degree that, as recorded by Henry of Huntingdon, they had the prelates confined and attempted by means of &#x27;strong coercion&#x27; to force their acquiescence. Theobald himself was said to have escaped across the Thames and eventually into temporary exile in Flanders. While Edmund King casts doubts on this particular account he does not doubt the King&#x27;s rage. 

This clearly had not been Stephen&#x27;s first attempt at crowning Eustace as John of Salisbury reports that Celestine II had written to Archbishop Theobald as early as 1143 forbidding him &#x27;to allow any change to be made in the English kingdom in the matter of the crown&#x27;, a policy that was maintained by Celestine&#x27;s immediate successors. Eustace&#x27;s mother, Matilda of Boulogne, died on 3 May 1152, making him the count of Boulogne.

After the second siege of Wallingford in July 1153, after Henry had invaded England and attracted widespread support, Stephen was persuaded to agree to terms. The agreement, known as the Treaty of Winchester, established Henry as Stephen&#x27;s heir. Eustace withdrew from the court as a result of this, &quot;greatly vexed and angry, because the war, in his opinion, had not reached a proper conclusion&quot;.

==Death and aftermath==
Eustace died suddenly that same year, in mid-August 1153, struck down (so it was said) by the wrath of God while plundering church lands near Bury St Edmunds. Others believed that Eustace died simply of a broken heart. The death of Eustace was hailed with general satisfaction as opening the possibility of a peaceful settlement between Stephen and his rival, the young Henry Plantagenet. According to William of Newburgh, Stephen was &quot;grieved beyond measure by the death of the son whom he hoped would succeed him; he pursued warlike preparations less vigorously, and listened more patiently than usual to the voices of those urging peace.&quot;

The reputation Eustace left behind was mixed. On the one hand, the &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot;, not content with voicing this sentiment, gives Eustace a bad character. &quot;He was an evil man and did more harm than good wherever he went; he spoiled the lands and laid thereon heavy taxes.&quot; Eustace raided church lands near Peterborough, possibly inciting this hatred from the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. He had used threats against the recalcitrant bishops, and in the war against the Angevin party had demanded contributions from religious houses. However, the &quot;Gesta Stephani&quot; describes his courtly manner as a true heir to Stephen able to &quot;meet men on a footing of equality or superiority as the occasion acquired&quot;.

Eustace was buried in Faversham Abbey in Kent, which was founded by his parents. They too were buried in Faversham Abbey; all three tombs are now lost, as a consequence of the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

<text>Caesarea () also Caesarea Maritima, Caesarea Palaestinae or Caesarea Stratonis, was an ancient and medieval port city on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean, and later a small fishing village. It was the capital of Roman Judaea, Syria Palaestina and Palaestina Prima, successively, for a period of 650 years and a major intellectual hub of the Mediterranean. Today, the site is part of the Caesarea National Park, on the western edge of the Sharon plain in Israel.

The site was first settled in the 4th century BCE as a Phoenician colony and trading village known as Straton&#x27;s Tower after the ruler of Sidon. It was enlarged in the 1st century BCE under Hasmonean rule, becoming a Jewish village; and in 63 BCE, when the Roman Republic annexed the region, it was declared an autonomous city. It was then significantly enlarged in the Roman period by the Judaean client King Herod the Great, who established a harbour and dedicated the town and its port to Caesar Augustus as &quot;Caesarea&quot;.

During the early Roman period, Caesarea became the seat of the Roman procurators in the region. The city was populated throughout the 1st to 6th centuries CE and became an important early centre of Christianity during the Byzantine period. Its importance may have waned following the Muslim conquest of 640 when the city, then known in Arabic as Qisarya (), lost its status as provincial capital. After being re-fortified by Muslim rulers in the 11th century, it was conquered by the Crusaders, who strengthened and made it into an important port, which was finally slighted by the Mamluks in 1265.

Qisarya was a small fishing village in the early modern period. In February 1948, during the 1948 Palestine war and Nakba, some of its population fled following an attack on a bus by the Zionist militant group Lehi, and the remainder were expelled by the Palmach, who subsequently demolished its houses. The ruins of the ancient city beneath the depopulated village were excavated in the 1950s and 1960s for archaeological purposes.

==Name==
Whilst the name &quot;Caesarea&quot; was frequently used alone for the subject of this article, various markers were used to differentiate the location from these other locations; these include &quot;Palestina&quot; (&quot;of Palestine&quot;), &quot;Maritima&quot; (&quot;by the sea&quot;; Greek: &quot;Parálios&quot;), &quot;Sebaste&quot; and &quot;Stratonis&quot;. &quot;Palestina&quot; is the most common term used in ancient sources, but, since the creation of Israel in 1948, historians in the West have tended to use the term less frequently.

The Latin name &quot;Caesarea&quot; also referred to several other cities in the region, notably Caesarea near Mount Hermon and Caesarea the capital of Cappadocia.

==History==
===Classical antiquity===
&quot;Stratonos pyrgos&quot; (Straton&#x27;s Tower) was founded in the 4th century BCE by Abdashtart I, or Straton I king of Sidon. It was first established as a Phoenician colony and trading village. In 90 BCE, Jewish ruler Alexander Jannaeus captured Straton&#x27;s Tower as part of his policy of developing the shipbuilding industry and enlarging the Hasmonean kingdom. Straton&#x27;s Tower remained a Jewish settlement for two more generations, until the area became dominated by the Romans in 63 BCE, when they declared it an autonomous city.

====Herodian Caesarea====

Caesarea was built in Roman Judea under the Jewish client King Herod the Great during 22-10/9 BCE near the ruins of the small naval station of Straton&#x27;s Tower. The site, along with all of Judea, was awarded by Rome to Herod in 30 BCE. The pagan city underwent vast changes under Herod, who renamed it Caesarea in honour of the Roman emperor, Caesar Augustus. Caesarea was known as the administrative, economic, and cultural capital of the Judean province from this time.In 22 BCE, Herod began construction of a deep-sea harbour named Sebastos and built storerooms, markets, wide roads, baths, a temple to the goddess Roma and Emperor Augustus, and imposing public buildings. Herod built his palace on a promontory jutting out into the sea, with a decorative pool surrounded by stoas. Every five years, the city hosted major sports competitions, gladiator games, and theatrical productions in its theatre overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.

===== Sebastos harbor =====

Herod built the two jetties of the harbour between 22 and 15 BCE, and in 10/9 BCE he dedicated the city and harbour to Emperor Augustus (&quot;sebastos&quot; is Greek for &quot;augustus&quot;). The pace of construction was impressive considering the project&#x27;s size and complexity. At its height, Sebastos was one of the most impressive harbours of its time. It had been constructed on a coast that had no natural harbours and served as an important commercial harbour in antiquity, rivaling Cleopatra&#x27;s harbour at Alexandria. Josephus writes: &quot;Although the location was generally unfavorable, [Herod] contended with the difficulties so well that the solidity of the construction could not be overcome by the sea, and its beauty seemed finished off without impediment.&quot;

When it was built in the 1st century BCE, the harbour of Sebastos ranked as the largest artificial harbour built in the open sea, enclosing around 100,000 m2.

The breakwaters were made of lime and pozzolana, a type of volcanic ash, set into an underwater concrete. Herod imported over 24,000 m3 of pozzolana from the name-giving town of Puteoli, today Pozzuoli in Italy, to construct the two breakwaters: the southern one 500 meter, and the northern one 275 meter long.

A shipment of this size would have required at least 44 shiploads of 400 tons each. Herod also had 12,000 m3 of local kurkar stone quarried to make rubble and 12,000 m3 of slaked lime mixed with the pozzolana.

Architects had to devise a way to lay the wooden forms for the placement of concrete underwater. One technique was to drive stakes into the ground to make a box and then fill it with pozzolana concrete bit by bit. However, this method required many divers to hammer the planks to the stakes underwater and large quantities of pozzolana were necessary.

Another technique was a double planking method used in the northern breakwater. On land, carpenters would construct a box with beams and frames on the inside and a watertight, double-planked wall on the outside. This double wall was built with a gap between the inner and outer layer.

Although the box had no bottom, it was buoyant enough to float out to sea because of the watertight space between the inner and outer walls. Once it was floated into position, pozzolana was poured into the gap between the walls and the box would sink into place on the seafloor and be staked down in the corners. The flooded inside area was then filled by divers bit by bit with pozzolana-lime mortar and kurkar rubble until it rose above sea level.

On the southern breakwater, barge construction was used. The southern side of Sebastos was much more exposed than the northern side, requiring sturdier breakwaters. Instead of using the double planked method filled with rubble, the architects sank barges filled with layers of pozzolana concrete and lime sand mortar. The barges were similar to boxes without lids, and were constructed using mortise and tenon joints, the same technique used in ancient boats, to ensure they remained watertight. The barges were ballasted with 0.5 meters of pozzolana concrete and floated out to their position. With alternating layers, pozzolana-based and lime-based concretes were hand-placed inside the barge to sink it and fill it up to the surface.

However, there were underlying problems that led to its demise. Studies of the concrete cores of the moles have shown that the concrete was much weaker than similar pozzolana hydraulic concrete used in ancient Italian ports. For unknown reasons, the pozzolana mortar did not adhere as well to the kurkar rubble as it did to other rubble types used in Italian harbours. Small but numerous holes in some of the cores also indicate that the lime was of poor quality and stripped out of the mixture by strong waves before it could set.

Also, large lumps of lime were found in all five of the cores studied at Caesarea, which shows that the mixture was not mixed thoroughly. However, stability would not have been seriously affected if the harbour had not been constructed over a geological fault line that runs along the coast. Seismic action gradually took its toll on the breakwaters, causing them to tilt down and settle into the seabed. Studies of seabed deposits at Caesarea have shown that a tsunami struck the area sometime during the 1st or 2nd century.

Although it is unknown if this tsunami simply damaged or completely destroyed the harbour, it is known that by the 6th century the harbour was unusable and today the jetties lie more than 5 meters underwater.

====Roman Caeserea====
When Judea became a Roman province in 6 CE, Caesarea replaced Jerusalem as its civilian and military capital and became the official residence of its governors, such as procurator Antonius Felix and prefect Pontius Pilatus. The city was chiefly a commercial centre relying on trade.

Caeserea is described in detail by the 1st-century Roman Jewish historian Flavius Josephus. Josephus describes the harbour as being as large as the one at Piraeus, the major harbour of Athens. Remains of the principal buildings erected by Herod the Great as well as the medieval town are still visible today, including the Crusader city, the city walls, the ruined citadel surrounded by the sea, and remains of the cathedral and a second church. Herod&#x27;s Caesarea grew rapidly, in time becoming the largest city in Judaea with an estimated population of 125,000 over an urban area of . According to Josephus, Caesarea was the scene in 26 CE of a major act of civil disobedience to protest against Pilate&#x27;s order to plant eagle standards on the Temple Mount of Jerusalem.

Emperor Vespasian raised its status to that of a &quot;Colonia&quot;, with the name &quot;Colonia Prima Flavia Augusta Caesarea&quot;. According to Josephus, the outbreak of the Jewish revolt of 66 CE was provoked by Greeks of a certain merchant house in Caesarea sacrificing birds in front of a local synagogue. In 70 CE, after the Jewish revolt was suppressed, games were held there to celebrate the victory of Titus. Many Jewish captives were brought to Caesarea; Kasher claims that 2,500 captives were &quot;slaughtered in gladiatorial games&quot;.

In the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt Caesarea was changed to &quot;Syria Palaestina&quot; in 135. Caesarea was one of four Roman colonies for veteran Roman soldiers in the Syria-Phoenicia region. Caesarea is mentioned in the 3rd-century Mosaic of Rehob, with respect to its non-Jewish population.

=====Early Christian centre=====


According to the Acts of the Apostles, Caesarea was first introduced to Christianity by Philip the Deacon, who later had a house there in which he gave hospitality to Paul the Apostle. It was there that Peter the Apostle baptized Cornelius the Centurion and his household, the first time Christian baptism was conferred on Gentiles. When newly converted Paul was in danger in Jerusalem, the Christians there accompanied him to Caesarea and sent him off to his native Tarsus. He visited Caesarea between his second and third missionary journeys. Paul was a prisoner in Caesarea for two years before being sent to Rome.

In the 3rd century, Origen wrote his &quot;Hexapla&quot; and other exegetical and theological works while living in Caesarea. The Nicene Creed may have originated in Caesarea. The Apostolic Constitutions says that the first Bishop of Caesarea was Zacchaeus the Publican, followed by Cornelius (possibly Cornelius the Centurion) and Theophilus (possibly the recipient of the Gospel of Luke). The first bishops considered historically attested are those mentioned by the early church historian Eusebius of Caesarea, who was the bishop of the see in the 4th century. He speaks of Theophilus who was bishop in the 10th year of Commodus (c. 189), of Theoctistus (216–258), Domnus, and Theotecnus, and Agapius. Among the participants in the Synod of Ancyra in 314 was the bishop of Caesarea named Agricolaus, who may have been the immediate predecessor of Eusebius, who does not mention him, or who may have been bishop of a different Caesarea. The immediate successors of Eusebius were Acacius (340–366) and Gelasius (367–372, 380–395). The latter was ousted by the semi-Arian Euzoius between 373 and 379. French historian Michel Le Quien gives much information about all of these and about later bishops of Caesarea. The Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem has a metropolitan see in Caesarea. The Latin archbishopric of Caesarea in Palestina was made a Roman Catholic titular see in 1432. The Melkite Catholic Church considers Caesarea a titular see.

Through Origen and especially the scholarly presbyter Pamphilus of Caesarea, the theological school of Caesarea gained a reputation for having the most extensive ecclesiastical library of the time, containing more than 30,000 manuscripts: Gregory Nazianzus, Basil the Great, Jerome and others came to study there. The Caesarean text-type is recognized by scholars as one of the earliest New Testament types. The collections of the library suffered during the persecutions under Emperor Diocletian but were repaired subsequently by bishops of Caesarea. The library is mentioned as late as 6th-century manuscripts, but it may not have survived the capture of Caesarea by the Muslim armies in 640.

===Middle Ages===

====Byzantine period====
During the Byzantine period, Caesarea became the capital of the province of Palaestina Prima in 390. Caesarea was also the metropolitan see, with ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Jerusalem, when rebuilt after its destruction in 70. In 451, however, the Council of Chalcedon established Jerusalem as a patriarchate, with Caesarea as the first of its three subordinate metropolitan sees. Caesarea remained the provincial capital throughout the 5th and 6th centuries. It fell to Sassanid Persia in the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, in 614, and was re-conquered by Byzantium in 625.

====Early Muslim period====


Caesarea was lost for good by the Byzantines to the Muslim conquest in 640. Archaeological excavations discovered a destruction layer connected to the Muslim conquest of the city. Some newer research posits that there was no destruction caused by the Persians in 614 and Muslim Arabs in 640, but rather a gradual economic decline accompanied by the Christian aristocracy fleeing from the city.

According to 9th-century Muslim historian al-Baladhuri, the fall of the city was the result of the betrayal of a certain Yusef, who conducted a party of troops of Muawiyah into the city. The city appears to have been partially destroyed upon its conquest. The 7th-century Coptic bishop John of Nikiû, claims there were &quot;horrors committed in the city of Caesarea in Palestine&quot;, while al-Baladhuri merely states that Kaisariyyah/Cæsarea was &quot;reduced&quot;, mentioning it as one of ten towns in Jund Filastin (military district of Palestine) conquered by the Muslim Rashidun army under &#x27;Amr ibn al-&#x27;As&#x27;s leadership during the 630s. After the fall of Caesarea, 4,000 &quot;heads&quot; (captives), men, women and children, were sent to Caliph Umar in Medina, where they were gathered and inspected on the Jurd Plain, a plain commonly used to assemble the troops of Medina before battle, with room for thousands of people, before they were distributed as war booty to slavery in the Rashidun Caliphate.

The former Palaestina Prima became &quot;Jund Filastin&quot;, with the capital first at Ludd and then at Ramla. The city likely remained inhabited for some time under Arab rule, during the 7th and 8th centuries, albeit with much reduced population. Archaeological evidence shows a clear destruction layer identified with the conquest of 640, followed by some evidence of renewed settlement in the early Umayyad Caliphate. The area was farmed from the Rashidun Caliphate through to the First Crusade.

By the 11th century, it appears that the town had once again been developed into a fortified city. Writing in 1047, Nasir Khusraw describes it as &quot;a fine city, with running waters, and palm-gardens, and orange and citron trees. Its walls are strong, and it has an iron gate. There are fountains that gush out within the city&quot;. This is in agreement with William of Tyre&#x27;s description of the Crusaders&#x27; siege in 1101, mentioning catapults and siege engines used against the city fortifications. Nasir Khusraw notes a &quot;beautiful Friday mosque&quot; in Caesarea, &quot;so situated that in its court you may sit and enjoy the view of all that is passing on the sea.&quot; This was converted into the church of St. Peter in Crusader times. A wall which may belong to this building has been identified in modern times.

====Crusader and Ayyubid period====

Caesarea was taken by Baldwin I in the wake of the First Crusade, in 1101. Baldwin sent a message to emir of Caesarea, demanding him to surrender the city or face a siege, but the Muslims refused. On May 2, 1101, Baldwin began sieging the city with trebuchets. After 15 days of resistance, the Crusader army broke through the defenses. Like in Jerusalem in 1099, the Crusaders proceeded to slaughter a portion of the male populace, enslave the women and children, and loot the city. William of Tyre describes the use of catapults and siege towers, and states that the city was taken in an assault after 15 days of siege and given over to looting and pillaging. Syriac Orthodox patriarch Michael the Syrian (born ca. 1126) records that the city was &quot;devastated upon its capture&quot;.

Baldwin spared the emir and qadi for a hefty ransom. Baldwin appointed a cleric veteran of the First Crusade, also named Baldwin, as the Latin archbishop of Caesarea. The city was under Crusader control between 1101 and 1187 and again between 1191 and 1265. William of Tyre mentions the discovery of a &quot;vessel of the most green colour, in the shape of a serving dish&quot; (&quot;vas coloris viridissimi, in modum parapsidis formatum&quot;) which the Genuese thought to be made of emerald, and accepted as their share of the spoils. This refers to the hexagonal bowl known as the &quot;Sacro Catino&quot; in Italian, which was brought to Genoa by Guglielmo Embriaco and was later identified as the Holy Chalice. Caesarea was incorporated as a lordship (dominion) within the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the Latin See of Caesarea was established, with ten archbishops listed for the period 1101–1266 (treated as titular see from 1432–1967). Archbishop Heraclius attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179.

Saladin recaptured the city in 1187, but it was once again captured by the Crusaders during the Third Crusade in 1191. In 1251 during the Seventh Crusade, Louis IX of France fortified the city, ordering the construction of high walls (parts of which are still standing) and a deep moat.

In 1265 the city was reconquered by the Mamluk armies of Sultan Baibars, who ordered his troops to scale the walls in several places simultaneously, enabling them to penetrate the city. Baibars destroyed the fortified city completely to prevent its re-emergence as a Crusader stronghold, in line with the Mamluk practice in other former Crusader coastal cities. During the Mamluk period, the ruins of ancient Caesarea and of the Crusader fortified town lay uninhabited. Al-Dimashqi, writing around 1300, notes that Kaisariyyah belonged to the Kingdom of Ghazza (Gaza).

===Modern period===

====Ottoman Empire====
Caesarea became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1516, along with the rest of the Levant, and remained under Ottoman rule for four centuries. In 1664, a settlement is mentioned consisting of 100 Moroccan families and 7 to 8 Jewish ones. In the 18th century it again declined. In 1806, the German explorer Ulrich Jasper Seetzen saw &quot;Káisserérie&quot; as a ruin occupied by some poor fishermen and their families.

In 1870, French explorer Victor Guérin visited the site. The village of Qisarya () was allocated in 1880 to Bushnak (Bosniak) immigrants from Bosnia. The Bosniaks had emigrated to the area after Ottoman Bosnia was occupied by Austria-Hungary in 1878. According to historian Roy Marom,Fifty families of Bosnian refugees, mostly from Mostar, the main urban center of Bosnia and Herzegovina, settled among the ruins of Caesarea, renaming it with the Arabic name of Qisarya. Using the ancient masonry found on site, the settlers constructed a modern town with spacious accommodations and broad intersecting streets, according to traditional Bosnian town-plans. The town had two mosques, a caravanserai, a marketplace, a residence for the &quot;mudir&quot;, a harbor and custom offices. Qisarya attracted high-ranking Bosnian functionaries who established estates near Qisarya. The town was declared the seat of a &quot;mudirieh&quot; (a minor administrative division).A population list from about 1887 showed that Caesarea had 670 inhabitants, in addition to 265 Muslim inhabitants, who were noted as &quot;Bosniaks&quot;.

Petersen, visiting the place in 1992, noted that the 19th-century houses were built in blocks, generally one story high, with the exception of the house of the governor. Some houses on the western side of the village, near the sea, had survived. There were several mosques in the village in the 19th century, but only one (&quot;The Bosnian mosque&quot;) has survived. This mosque, located at the southern end of the city, next to the harbour, is described as a simple stone building with a red-tiled roof and a cylindrical minaret.

====British Mandate of Palestine====
In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Caesarea had a population of 346; 288 Muslims, 32 Christians and 26 Jews, where the Christians were 6 Orthodox, 3 Syrian Orthodox, 3 Roman Catholics, 4 Melkites, 2 Syrian Catholics and 14 Maronite. The population had increased in the 1931 census to 706; 19 Christians, 4 Druse and 683 Muslims, in 143 houses.

A Jewish settlement, Kibbutz Sdot Yam, was established south of the Muslim town in 1940. The Muslim village declined in economic importance and many of Qisarya&#x27;s Muslim inhabitants left in the mid-1940s, when the British extended the Palestine Railways which bypassed the shallow-draft port. Qisarya had a population of 960 in 1945 statistics, with Qisarya&#x27;s population composition 930 Muslims and 30 Christians in 1945. In 1944/45 a total of 18 dunums of Muslim village land was used for citrus and bananas, 1,020 dunums were used for cereals, while 108 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, while 111 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

====1947–present====
The civil war in Mandatory Palestine began on 30 November 1947. In December 1947 a village notable, Tawfiq Kadkuda, approached local Jews in an effort to establish a non-belligerency agreement. The 31 January 1948 Lehi attack on a bus leaving Qisarya, which killed two and injured six people, precipitated an evacuation of most of the population, who fled to nearby al-Tantura. The Haganah then occupied the village because the land was owned by the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association and, fearing that the British would force them to leave, decided to demolish the houses. This was done on 19–20 February, after the remaining residents were expelled and the houses were looted. According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, the expulsion of the population had more to do with illegal Jewish immigration than the ongoing civil war. In the same month the &#x27;Arab al Sufsafi and Saidun Bedouin, who inhabited the dunes between Qisarya and Pardes left the area.

In 1952, the Jewish town of Caesarea was established to the north of the ruins of the old city, which in 2011 were incorporated into the newly created Caesarea National Park.

In 1992, Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village remains: &quot;Most of the houses have been demolished. The site has been excavated in recent years, largely by Italian, American, and Israeli teams, and turned into a tourist area. Most of the few remaining houses are now restaurants, and the village mosque has been converted into a bar.&quot; Since 2000, the site of Caesarea is included in the &quot;Tentative List of World Heritage Places&quot; of the UNESCO.

==Archaeology and reconstruction==
Large-scale archaeological excavations began in the 1950s and 1960s and continue to this day, conducted by volunteers working under the supervision of archaeologists. The majority of the archaeological excavations are done by the United States and Israel. Remains from many periods have been uncovered, in particular from the large city of the Roman and Byzantine periods and from the fortified town of the Crusaders. Major Classical-era findings are the Roman theatre; a temple dedicated to the goddess Roma and Emperor Augustus; a hippodrome rebuilt in the 2nd century as a more conventional theatre; the Tiberieum, where archaeologists found a reused limestone block with a dedicatory inscription mentioning Pilate the only archaeological find bearing his name and title; a double aqueduct that brought water from springs at the foot of Mount Carmel; a boundary wall; and a 200 ft (60 m) wide moat protecting the harbour to the south and west.

In 1986, the Israel Exploration Society published the archaeological findings of L.I. Levine and E. Netzer, during three seasons of excavations (1975, 1976 and 1979) at Caesarea. In 2010, archaeological surveys-excavations of the site were conducted by Dani Vaynberger and Carmit Gur on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), and others by Peter Gendelman and Jacob Sharvit on behalf of the IAA, Yosef Porath, Beverly Goodman, and Michal Artzy on behalf of University of Haifa. The site continued to be excavated as late as 2013. A new phase of exploration began in 2018 under the direction of Joseph L. Rife, Phillip Lieberman, and Peter Gendelman on behalf of Vanderbilt University and the IAA.

In February 2015, marine archaeologists and diving club members from the Israel Antiquities Authority announced that about 2,000 gold coins dating back more than 1,000 years had been discovered. According to the researchers, the coins may have been part of a large merchant ship trading with the coastal cities and ports in the Mediterranean, and the coins may have been used to pay the salaries of the Fatimid military garrison. In January 2021, researchers re-examined the coins discovered in 2015, and they retrieved hundreds more. The coins with Arabic text on both sides were 24 carat gold and 95 percent purity.

A large compound, located in the archaeologists&#x27; Area CC, in the first &quot;insula&quot; of the Roman and Byzantine city south of the Crusader wall and close to the sea, along the &quot;decumanus&quot;, was in use as the Roman &quot;praetorium&quot; of the equestrian fiscal procurator, and then became the seat of the Byzantine governor. It contained a basilica with an apse, where magistrates would have sat, for the structure was used as a hall of justice, as fragments of inscriptions detailing the fees that court clerks might claim attest.

A rare, colorful mosaic dating from the 2nd-3rd century CE was uncovered in 2018, in the Caesarea National Park near a Crusader bridge. It contains the image of three male figures wearing togas, geometric patterns, as well as a largely damaged inscription in Greek. It is one of the few extant examples of mosaics from that specific time period in Israel. The mosaic measures 3.5 × 8 meters and is, according to its excavators, &quot;of a rare high quality&quot; comparable to that of Israel&#x27;s finest examples.

In 1962, a team of Israeli and American archaeologists discovered in the sand of Caesarea three small fragments of one Hebrew stone inscription bearing the partial names of places associated with the priestly courses (the rest of which had been reconstructed), dated to the third-fourth centuries. The uniqueness of this discovery is that it shows the places of residence in Galilee of the priestly courses, places presumably resettled by Jews after the First Jewish–Roman War under Hadrian.

The main Byzantine church, an octagonal martyrion, was built in the 6th century and sited directly upon the podium that had supported Herod&#x27;s temple, as was a widespread Christian practice. The &quot;martyrion&quot; was richly paved and surrounded by small radiating enclosures. Archaeologists have recovered some foliate capitals that included representations of the Cross. The site would in time be re-occupied, this time by a mosque.

In 2005 excavators found a well-preserved 6th-century panel covered in an exquisite mosaic made of glass gold and coloured opaque glass tesserae, used as a table, patterned with crosses and rosettes. In 2018, a significant hoard of 24 gold coins and a gold earring was unearthed and tentatively dated to 1101.

<doc id="78834" wikidata="Q125017" url="?curid=78834" title="Uma Thurman">
<text>Uma Karuna Thurman (born April 29, 1970) is an American actress. She has performed in a variety of films, from romantic comedies and dramas to science fiction and action films. Following her appearances on the December 1985 and May 1986 covers of British &quot;Vogue&quot;, Thurman starred in &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988). She rose to international prominence with her performance as Mia Wallace in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actress. Often hailed as Tarantino&#x27;s muse, she reunited with the director to play the main role in &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; (2003, 2004), which brought her a BAFTA Award nomination and two additional Golden Globe Award nominations.

Established as a Hollywood actress, Thurman&#x27;s other notable films include &quot;Henry &amp; June&quot; (1990), &quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; (1996), &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1998), &quot;Paycheck&quot; (2003), &quot;The Producers&quot; (2005), &quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot; (2006), &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot; (2010), Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot; (2013), &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot; (2018), and &quot;Hollywood Stargirl&quot; (2022). In 2011, she was a member of the jury for the main competition at the 64th Cannes Film Festival, and in 2017, she was named president of the 70th edition&#x27;s &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; jury. Thurman made her Broadway debut in &quot;The Parisian Woman&quot; (2017–2018).

Thurman won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Film for her performance in the made-for-HBO film &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot; (2002) and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her five-episode role in the NBC musical series &quot;Smash&quot; (2012). She also starred in the miniseries &quot;The Slap&quot; (2015) and the series &quot;Imposters&quot; (2017–2018), &quot;Chambers&quot; (2019) and &quot;Super Pumped&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Uma Karuna Thurman was born on April 29, 1970, in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father, Robert Thurman, is a professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies and an author, who lived as an ordained Buddhist monk for three years. Her mother, Nena von Schlebrügge, a high-fashion model, was born in Mexico City to a German nobleman and a Swedish model, Birgit Holmquist.

Thurman received a Buddhist upbringing, and spent altogether around two years in Almora, Uttarakhand, India. She grew up mostly in Amherst, Massachusetts, where she went to Amherst Regional Junior High School, then moved to Woodstock, New York. She has three brothers, Ganden (b. 1967), Dechen Karl (b. 1973), and Mipam (b. 1978), and a half-sister named Taya (b. 1961), from her father&#x27;s previous marriage. Thurman&#x27;s first cousin once removed is Swedish soccer player Max von Schlebrügge.

She is described, in a 2004 biography, as having been an awkward and introverted girl who was teased for her appearance and unusual name (sometimes using the name &quot;Uma Karen&quot; instead of her birth name). When Thurman was ten years old, a friend&#x27;s mother suggested a nose job. As a child, she suffered bouts of body dysmorphic disorder. She attended Amherst Public Schools, where in eighth grade she discovered her love of acting. At age 14, she attended Northfield Mount Hermon School, a preparatory school in Massachusetts, where talent scouts noticed her performance as Abigail in a production of &quot;The Crucible&quot; and offered her the chance to act professionally; she then dropped out to pursue an acting career.

==Career==
===Modeling and acting beginnings (1985–1989)===
Thurman began her career as a fashion model at age 15, and signed with the agency Click Models. Her early modeling credits included &quot;Glamour&quot; and the December 1985 and May 1986 covers of British &quot;Vogue&quot;. She made the transition to acting with her film debut, the teen thriller &quot;Kiss Daddy Goodnight&quot;, which was released in 1987. Thurman was subsequently cast in three 1988 films — &quot;Johnny Be Good&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; and most notably, &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;. In the comedy &quot;Johnny Be Good&quot;, she played the girlfriend of a top high school quarterback prospect, and in &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;, she made a brief appearance as the goddess Venus; during her entrance she briefly appears nude, in an homage to Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;. 

In the Oscar-winning drama &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, co-starring Glenn Close and John Malkovich, Thurman took on the role of a naive teenager, seduced by a manipulative man. The picture was an arthouse success, and garnered Thurman recognition from critics and audiences; film critic Roger Ebert found her to be &quot;well cast&quot; in her &quot;tricky&quot; key role. At the time, insecure about her appearance, she spent roughly a year in London, during which she often wore loose, baggy clothing. Malkovich said of her, &quot;There is nothing twitchy teenager-ish about her, I haven&#x27;t met anyone like her at that age. Her intelligence and poise stand out. But there&#x27;s something else. She&#x27;s more than a little haunted.&quot;

===Early prominence and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1990–1995)===
In 1990, Thurman appeared with Fred Ward and Maria de Medeiros in &quot;Henry &amp; June&quot;, a sexually provocative drama about the relationship and affairs between writer Henry Miller and his wife June Miller in 1931 Paris. This film was the first to receive an NC-17 rating and partly because many American newspapers refused to advertise films with the new rating, it did not get wide release in the United States. However, it won Thurman good notices; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Thurman, as the Brooklyn-accented June, takes a larger-than-life character and makes her even bigger, though the performance is often as curious as it is commanding.&quot; After playing Maid Marian in the 1991 British adventure film &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, Thurman began filming &quot;Dylan Thomas&quot;, a biopic on Welsh poet Dylan Thomas starring her then-husband Gary Oldman with herself as Caitlin Thomas, however the project was shut down shortly after filming began. Thurman went on to star as the patient of a San Francisco psychiatrist in the neo-noir drama &quot;Final Analysis&quot; (1992), opposite Richard Gere and Kim Basinger, and as a blind woman romantically involved with a former policeman in the thriller &quot;Jennifer 8&quot; (also 1992), with Andy García.

Thurman portrayed a young woman with unusually big thumbs in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 1993 adaptation of Tom Robbins&#x27; novel &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;. The film was a critical and commercial failure, eventually earning Thurman a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described her acting as shallow and remarked: &quot;Thurman&#x27;s strangely passive characterization doesn&#x27;t go much deeper than drawling and flexing her prosthetic thumbs&quot;. Also in 1993, she starred as a waitress opposite Robert De Niro and Bill Murray in the drama &quot;Mad Dog and Glory&quot; and auditioned for Stanley Kubrick while he was casting for his eventually unrealized adaptation of the novel &quot;Wartime Lies&quot;.
In Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s neo-noir black comedy &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), Thurman played Mia Wallace, the wife of a Los Angeles mobster. Several actresses were considered for the role, but Tarantino wanted Thurman after their first meeting. The film grossed $213.9 million worldwide and received widespread acclaim, appearing on many critics&#x27; lists of the greatest films ever made. She dominated most of the movie&#x27;s promotional material; Mia is considered one of the most iconic female film characters of the 1990s. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; asserted that Thurman was &quot;serenely unrecognizable in a black wig, [and] is marvelous as a zoned-out gangster&#x27;s girlfriend&quot;. For her performance, Thurman was nominated for the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and launched into the celebrity A-list. She took little advantage of her new-found fame by choosing not to do any big-budget films for the next three years. In a 2003 interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Tarantino, who considers Thurman his muse, remarked that she was &quot;up there with Garbo and Dietrich in goddess territory&quot;.

===Established career (1996–2002)===
Thurman&#x27;s next films, the romantic dramedy &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;, in which she played a fairly wise love interest, and the comedy &quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot;, in which she top-billed as a ditzy blonde model, were modest commercial successes amid a positive critical response upon their theatrical releases in 1996. In 1997, Thurman starred opposite Ethan Hawke in &quot;Gattaca&quot;, a science fiction film set in a future society driven by eugenics where potential children are conceived through genetic manipulation. The film received critical praise and became successful on the home video market, despite lackluster box office receipts. Her next film role was that of supervillain Poison Ivy in &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997). Budgeted at $160 million, the film grossed a modest $238 million worldwide and is often considered to be one of the worst films ever made. Thurman&#x27;s performance, however, was largely highlighted upon the film&#x27;s release; the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; remarked that &quot;Thurman [...] sometimes seems to be doing Mae West by way of Jessica Rabbit&quot;, and a similar comparison was made by &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;[L]ike Mae West, she mixes true femininity with the winking womanliness of a drag queen&quot;. She obtained a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Best Sci-fi Actress and was also nominated for Favourite Movie Actress at the Kids&#x27; Choice Awards.

Thurman took on the role of Fantine in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, the 1998 film version of Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel of the same name, directed by Bille August. The film was considered an &quot;intelligent, handsomely crafted adaptation&quot; of the classic novel, according to Rotten Tomatoes, and on his review of the film, Roger Ebert expressed that &quot;Thurman&#x27;s performance is the best element&quot; of the story. That year, she also starred as a British secret agent in &quot;The Avengers&quot;, a notable financial and critical flop; CNN described her as &quot;so distanced you feel like you&#x27;re watching her through the wrong end of a telescope&quot;. In 1999, she performed in theater in an update of Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; at the Classic Stage Company, and portrayed a socialite in Woody Allen&#x27;s romantic dramedy &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot;, opposite Sean Penn. Thurman was in a hiatus from acting at the time as she had her daughter in 1998, doing only a few small, low-budget projects after giving birth; she eventually turned down the role of Éowyn in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, which she considers &quot;one of the worst decisions [she] ever made&quot;.
Thurman headlined the period drama &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; (2000), based on the 1904 novel of the same name by Henry James. In November 2000, she narrated the John Moran opera &quot;Book of the Dead (2nd Avenue)&quot; at The Public Theater. The historical drama &quot;Vatel&quot; (2000) saw Thurman play Anne de Montausier, the love interest of 17th-century French chef François Vatel, and in Richard Linklater&#x27;s real-time drama &quot;Tape&quot; (2001), she starred as the former girlfriend of a drug dealer and volunteer firefighter (Ethan Hawke). She was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female for her part in &quot;Tape&quot;. Hawke directed her in &quot;Chelsea Walls&quot; (2001), a drama revolving a number of artists as they spend a single day in New York&#x27;s famed bohemian home Chelsea Hotel. Thurman would win a Golden Globe for her performance in the HBO cable film &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot; (2002), where she was also one of the executive producers. Thurman played a New Jersey woman in the 1980s searching for romance. In its review, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; remarked: &quot;Thurman so commits herself to the role, eyes blazing and body akimbo, that you start to believe that such a creature could exist—an exquisite-looking woman so spastic and needy that she repulses regular Joes. Thurman has bent the role to her will.&quot;

===Renewed success with &quot;Kill Bill&quot; (2003–2005)===
Thurman reunited with Quentin Tarantino for the two-part martial arts action film &quot;Kill Bill&quot; (2003–2004), portraying assassin Beatrix Kiddo, out for revenge against her former lover. Tarantino wrote the part specifically for her. He cited Thurman as his muse while writing the film, and gave her joint credit for the character, whom the two conceived on the set of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; from the sole image of a bride covered in blood. Thurman&#x27;s main inspiration for the role was the title character of &quot;Coffy&quot; (played by Pam Grier) and the character of Gloria Swenson from &quot;Gloria&quot; (played by Gena Rowlands). She said that both of them are &quot;two of the only women I&#x27;ve ever seen be truly women [while] holding a weapon&quot;. Production was delayed for several months after Thurman became pregnant and Tarantino refused to recast the part. The film took nine months to shoot, and was filmed in five different countries. The role was also her most demanding, and she spent three months training in martial arts, swordsmanship, and Japanese. &quot;Kill Bill&quot; was originally set to be released as one film, however, due to its long running time, it was ultimately released in two parts. Both volumes scored highly with critics and audiences, subsequently developing a cult following. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; likened Thurman to &quot;an avenging angel out of a 1940s Hollywood melodrama&quot;. She was nominated for two Golden Globes for both entries, plus three MTV Movie Awards for Best Female Performance and two for Best Fight.

By 2005, Thurman had a reported asking price of $12.5 million per film. Besides the children&#x27;s film &quot;The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie&quot;, in which Thurman had a cameo, she had three other major film releases throughout 2005. Her first film in the year was the crime-comedy &quot;Be Cool&quot;, the sequel to 1995&#x27;s &quot;Get Shorty&quot;, which reunited her with her &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; co-star John Travolta. Despite a lukewarm critical reception, the film grossed $95 million. She next starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Prime&quot; with Meryl Streep, playing a divorced and lonesome business-woman who enters a relationship with a much younger man (Bryan Greenberg). A modest mainstream success, it eventually grossed $67.9 million internationally. In the remake &quot;The Producers&quot; (her last 2005 film), Thurman played Ulla, a Swedish stage actress hoping to win a part in a new Broadway musical. She is credited for her songs in the film. While box office receipts were modest, Thurman garnered acclaim from critics; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;Thurman as a would-be actress is the one bit of genuine radiance in this aggressively and pointlessly shiny, noisy spectacle.&quot;

===Commercial fluctuations (2006–2011)===
In 2006, Thurman starred opposite Luke Wilson in &quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot;, playing a superhero who is dumped by her boyfriend and then takes her revenge upon him. She received $14 million for the role, but the film was panned by critics and made a modest $61 million worldwide. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that it was a &quot;miscalculation to make Thurman the antagonist. She does a sprightly satiric turn, but [it is] wasted in a movie that would rather tweak male paranoia than liberate a nerdette terrified of her powers&quot;. In the 2007 film &quot;The Life Before Her Eyes&quot;, Thurman starred as an accident survivor whose guilt causes her present-day life to fall apart. It received a limited theatrical release and was dismissed by critics as &quot;a confusing, painfully overwrought melodrama&quot;.
In 2008, Thurman starred with Colin Firth and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in &quot;The Accidental Husband&quot;, a romantic comedy where she played a woman who finds herself married while engaged to another man. Despite theatrical runs abroad, the film was released on DVD in North America due to financial problems with its distributor. She also took on the role of a cocaine addict in the British television drama &quot;My Zinc Bed&quot;, which garnered what was considered poor ratings, especially given her involvement.

In 2009&#x27;s &quot;Motherhood&quot;, she starred as a New York City mother whose dilemmas of marriage, work, and self are shown in the trials and tribulations of one pivotal day. &quot;I&#x27;ve never really played a realistic mom before,&quot; she said. Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only, the independent dramedy garnered just $93,388 in three weeks of release. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic A. O. Scott felt that Thurman&#x27;s character is &quot;scattered, ambivalent, flaky and inconsistent—all of which is fine, and energetically conveyed by Ms. Thurman. But what are tolerable quirks in a person can be deadly to a narrative [...] the movie stumbles from loose and scruffy naturalism to sitcom tidiness&quot;. Thurman filmed a brief role in the fantasy adaptation &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot; (2010), appearing as Medusa, a gorgon cursed by Athena.

In 2011, she was a member of the jury for the main competition at the Cannes Film Festival, and her only film in the year—&quot;Ceremony&quot;—was released for VOD and selected theaters after its initial screening at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. In the independent comedy, she starred as woman on the eve of her wedding who re-connects with an old fling (played by Michael Angarano). By that time, she had taken on the roles of a powerful and wealthy mistress in the period drama &quot;Bel Ami&quot; (2012), a trophy wife in the romantic comedy &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot; (2012), and that of Lois Lane in a segment of the anthology film &quot;Movie 43&quot; (2013); all films were panned by critics and flopped at the box office. Writing for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in her review for &quot;Ceremony&quot;, Elizabeth Weitzman noted: &quot;She gets stuck in so many small, undeserving projects, one has to wonder who&#x27;s mapping out her career&quot;.

===Transition to television and Broadway debut (2012–2018)===
Thurman ventured into television in 2012, when she joined the cast of the drama series &quot;Smash&quot; in its first season, portraying the five-episode role of Rebecca Duvall, a Hollywood actress who wants to star in a new Broadway musical, despite having limited musical ability. Her performance garnered critical acclaim, with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; writing: &quot;Uma Thurman is a lot of fun. She gives that character some pop, playing both the shallow, demanding side of celebrity [...] and the sincere, talented side [...]&quot;. She earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.
Thurman appeared in the &quot;Volume I&quot; of Lars von Trier&#x27;s two-part ensemble art drama &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot; (2013) as Mrs. H, a rejected wife who confronts her estranged husband. Despite her limited screen time in the film, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that she was &quot;sensational&quot; in a role that defies &quot;[von Trier]&#x27;s mixed feelings about female power&quot;, while &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; found her to be &quot;downright terrific&quot;, noting that she &quot;lends the character [...] a good deal of dignity&quot;. For her part, she received a Bodil Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and in 2014, she won the BAMBI Award for Best International Actress.

In 2015, Thurman starred on the NBC miniseries &quot;The Slap&quot;, the American adaptation of the Australian series of the same name about the fallout after a man slaps another couple&#x27;s misbehaving child, and played a famed restaurant critic named Simone in the drama &quot;Burnt&quot;, starring Bradley Cooper. In 2017, Thurman took on the recurring role of a fixer on the Bravo dark comedy series &quot;Imposters&quot;, which ran for two seasons, and was named president of Cannes Film Festival &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; jury for &quot;works which offer a unique perspective and aesthetic&quot;.

Thurman made her Broadway debut in &quot;The Parisian Woman&quot;, a play written by Beau Willimon. Set in Washington, D.C., the production saw her star as a socialite coming to terms with politics, her past, her marriage and an uncertain future. The play ran for 141 performances, including previews, between November 2017 and March 2018, garnering a mixed critical response and what was described as &quot;strong&quot; box-office returns by &quot;Playbill&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked: &quot;Unlike many actors whose expertise derives from movies, [Thurman] has no trouble fully inhabiting, and projecting, even a jury-rigged character like [hers]. Her intelligence and, it has to be said, her innate glamour, make it possible to care about someone you do not believe in&quot;. For her role, she won the Broadway.com Audience Award for Favorite Leading Actress in a Play.

&quot;The Con Is On&quot;, an independent heist comedy Thurman filmed in 2015, opposite Tim Roth, was released on May 4, 2018. Both actors played a con-artist couple planning a jewel heist in Los Angeles, after escaping from a notorious Russian gangster. She reunited with director Lars von Trier to play the first victim of a serial killer during the 1980s in his psychological horror film &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot;, which premiered on May 14, 2018, at the Cannes Film Festival. In her next film, the supernatural thriller &quot;Down a Dark Hall&quot; (2018), directed by Rodrigo Cortés, Uma portrayed the role of Madame Duret, the eccentric headmistress of a mysterious school for troubled girls. In its review for the latter film, &quot;Variety&quot; noted that she &quot;cuts an elegant figure [...] but her somewhat unconvincing villain could have used more notes of mystery and wit&quot;.

===Television and film roles (2019–present)===
Thurman played a grieving mother in the Netflix supernatural horror series &quot;Chambers&quot;, which was released on April 26, 2019. Alex McLevy, for &quot; The A.V. Club&quot;, felt that she sold &quot;the hell out of [her] often absurd role&quot;, which he found to be &quot;over-written&quot;, as part of an overall mixed response. In 2019, Thurman also received a career honorary award at the David di Donatello Film Awards in Italy, and performed the role of Helene Alving in a revival of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot; at the Williamstown Theatre Festival.

Thurman reunited with Robert De Niro, her co-star in &quot;Mad Dog and Glory&quot;, for the family comedy &quot;The War with Grandpa&quot;, in which she portrayed the daughter of his recently widowed character. Originally filmed in May 2017, the film had a lengthy post-production due to the closure of The Weinstein Company, the original distributor, but was eventually released theatrically in North America on October 9, 2020, by 101 Studios. Despite negative reviews, &quot;The War with Grandpa&quot; made US$40 million worldwide, which was deemed a success amid the COVID-19 pandemic. She served as the narrator of &quot;The Age of Nature&quot;, a three-part documentary series, which aired on PBS in October 2020.

The Apple TV+ thriller series &quot;Suspicion&quot;, which premiered on February 4, 2022, featured Thurman as an American media mogul whose son is kidnapped. The production received mixed reviews from critics, who collectively noted that she &quot;was barely in it at all&quot;, despite being heavily promoted. She next portrayed Arianna Huffington, the co-founder of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, in &quot;The Battle For Uber&quot;, the first season of &quot;Super Pumped&quot;, an anthology drama television series created by Brian Koppelman and David Levien, which debuted on Showtime on February 27, 2022. While Brian Lowry of CNN praised Thurman&#x27;s efforts at a Greek accent, Adrian Horton of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described her portrayal as &quot;a cringey caricature&quot; of Huffington. Thurman appeared as Roxanne Martel in the coming-of-age film &quot;Hollywood Stargirl&quot;, which was released on June 3, 2022, on Disney+.

As of 2023, Thurman will star as an art dealer in the crime thriller &quot;The Kill Room&quot;, alongside &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; collaborator Samuel L. Jackson, and as fictional US president Ellen Claremont in the Amazon Prime romantic comedy &quot;Red White &amp; Royal Blue&quot;. She also joined the cast of the sequel to &quot;The Old Guard&quot;, alongside Charlize Theron.

===General===

&quot;Empire&quot; included Thurman among &quot;The 100 Sexiest Stars in Film History&quot; in 1995 as well as &quot;The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time&quot; in 1997. A regular feature on &quot;FHM&quot;″s &quot;100 Sexiest Women in the World&quot; from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, she also ranked at No. 34, No. 21 and No. 30 on the &quot;Maxim&quot; Hot 100 in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively. In 2013, Thurman was named one of the &quot;100 Hottest Women of the 21st Century&quot; by &quot;GQ&quot;.

On February 7, 2006, Thurman was awarded and named a knight of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France for outstanding achievement in the field of art and literature, and for her work and importance as an actress.

The American rock band Fall Out Boy released a song titled &quot;Uma Thurman&quot; in 2015, celebrating the actress and her roles in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. She gave permission for the band to use her name, and during an interview on the &quot;Today Show&quot;, stated: &quot;It&#x27;s very, like unbelievably polite and gracious of them. So sweet. I&#x27;m so happy for their big success&quot;.

In 2020, scientists named a new species of fringe-toed lizard from southwest Arizona (&quot;Uma thurmanae&quot;) after Thurman.

===Fashion===
The lavender Prada dress Thurman wore to the 67th Academy Awards on March 27, 1995, was admired by the media. Stylecaster.com stated that, as a result, &quot;Thurman became known for her stellar fashion sense, while Prada got a huge boost from instant name recognition the world over.&quot; Similarly, her crimson Alberta Ferretti dress at the 72nd Academy Awards on March 26, 2000, remains among her most notable, with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; voting it the 20th greatest red carpet gown of all time. Thurman has been a face and spokeswoman of Lancôme, TAG Heuer, Louis Vuitton, and Parfums Givenchy. She posed for the 2014 Campari Calendar and was among the actresses photographed by Peter Lindbergh for the 2017 Pirelli Calendar.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Thurman met English actor Gary Oldman on the set of &quot;State of Grace&quot;; they married in 1990 and divorced in 1992. On May 1, 1998, she married American actor Ethan Hawke, whom she met on the set of the 1997 film &quot;Gattaca&quot;. Hawke&#x27;s novel &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is dedicated to &quot;Karuna&quot;, Thurman&#x27;s middle name. Together, Thurman and Hawke have two children, a daughter, Maya (born in 1998), and a son, Levon (born in 2002). The couple separated in 2003, and the divorce was finalized in August 2005.

Thurman began dating London-based French financier Arpad Busson in 2007, and they announced their engagement in June 2008. In late 2009, they called off their engagement, but reconciled soon after. The couple called off the engagement for the second time in April 2014. Thurman and Busson have a daughter, Luna Thurman-Busson, born in July 2012. In January 2017, Thurman and Busson began child custody negotiations in relation to their daughter, which resulted in Thurman receiving primary physical custody later that month.

===Stalking incidents and sexual assaults===
Thurman was the target of a stalker, Jack Jordan, from about 2004 to 2011. He was arrested in October 2007 and, following a trial in which Thurman testified as a witness, was convicted of stalking and harassment charges the following May. Sentenced to three years&#x27; probation, Jordan was arrested again in 2010 on charges of violating a restraining order by attempting to contact her. He pleaded guilty in November 2011 after spending 11 months in jail in lieu of bail, and was released with time served.

In 2017, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, Thurman was interviewed, and, when asked about the scandal, she replied, &quot;no comment,&quot; stating she was too angry to talk about the case. A few weeks later, through an Instagram post, she joined the &quot;Me Too&quot; hashtag, confirming that she had suffered sexual harassment and expressing disgust for Harvey Weinstein. In a 2018 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Thurman revealed that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her in 1994 at the Savoy Hotel in London. She also revealed that she had been sexually assaulted at age 16 by an actor nearly 20 years her senior.

===&quot;Kill Bill&quot; car crash===
In the same 2018 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, Thurman described how she had been in a serious car accident back in 2003 on the set of &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, because Tarantino had insisted she perform her own driving stunts. Two weeks after the crash, she tried to see footage of the incident. Thurman stated that Miramax would only agree to show her the footage if she signed a contract &quot;releasing them of any consequences of my future pain and suffering&quot;, which she refused. As a result of the crash, she sustained permanent injuries to her neck and knees. Tarantino later called this incident &quot;the biggest regret of his life&quot;. Thurman later clarified on Instagram that Tarantino had apologized to her for the incident and that she has since forgiven him, being open to working with him again.

==Activism and political views==
Thurman has been involved in various philanthropic and activist causes. She is a supporter of the Democratic Party, and has given money to the campaigns of John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, and Joseph R. Driscoll. She supports gun control laws, and in 2000 participated in &quot;Marie Claire&quot;″s &quot;End Gun Violence Now&quot; campaign. She is a member of the board of Room to Grow, a charitable organization providing aid to families and children suffering poverty. She serves on the board of the Tibet House US. In 2007, she hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, with actor Kevin Spacey.

In February 2008, ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Thurman talked about human rights in China alongside Steven Spielberg and others, describing actions and policies carried out by the government of China as &quot;horrible&quot; and &quot;unspeakable crimes against humanity&quot;.

In 2011, Thurman was one of several celebrities associated with the USAID and Ad Council&#x27;s FWD campaign, an awareness initiative tied to that year&#x27;s East Africa drought. She joined Geena Davis, Chanel Iman and Josh Hartnett in TV and internet ads to &quot;forward the facts&quot; about the crisis. During the same year, she also participated at Human Rights Campaign for LGBT civil rights, saying &quot;We&#x27;re fighting for a conservative value: the right to make a lifelong commitment to someone you love&quot;. In 2015, Thurman joined &quot;Rhino Rescue Project&quot; and traveled to Southern Africa to assist and help relocate the threatened species of black rhinoceros; being in close contact with rhinos, Thurman defined her experience with those animals to be &quot;spiritual, surreal&quot;.

In December 2017, amidst allegations of sexual misconduct against Roy Moore, Thurman voiced her disapproval of his candidacy in the United States Senate special election in Alabama.

Thurman was critical of the Texas Heartbeat Act, an abortion ban that went into effect in September 2021. She called the law a &quot;human rights crisis for American women&quot;, and discussed her experience of obtaining an abortion in her teens after she had been &quot;accidentally impregnated by a much older man.&quot; She described her abortion as &quot;the hardest decision of my life,&quot; but maintained that it &quot;allowed me to grow up and become the mother I wanted and needed to be.&quot;

==Filmography==
Thurman has starred in over 50 films. According to review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes and infotainment website &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, her most critically acclaimed and commercial successful films include &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988), &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; (2003), &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot; (2004), &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1984), &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988), &quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; (1996), &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; (1996), &quot;Mad Dog and Glory&quot; (1993), &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; (1999), &quot;Tape&quot; (2001), &quot;Les Miserables&quot; (1998), and &quot;A Month by the Lake&quot; (1995).

<text>Giorgio Cavazzano (; born 19 October 1947) is an Italian cartoonist, and one of the most famous Disney comics artists in the world.

==Biography==
Giorgio Cavazzano was born 19 October 1947 in Venice, Italy. At the age of twelve, Cavazzano started to work with his cousin, the cartoonist Luciano Capitanio, helping him ink comics for the publishers Mondadori and Dardo, as well as a comic story published in the magazine Voci d’Oltremare. Still a teenager, he started his apprenticeship with the renowned Italian cartoonist Romano Scarpa, and at the age of 15, from issue #70 of &quot;Topolino&quot; (December 1962) ‑ he was Scarpa&#x27;s personal inker.

Cavazzano made his debut as a cartoonist in 1967 with the story &quot;Paperino e il singhiozzo a martello&quot;, while his first script was on &quot;Zio Paperone e il cambio della guardia&quot;, in 1985.

At the beginning of his career, his style was affected by Romano Scarpa&#x27;s style and the prevailing tradition of comic drawing of Carl Barks. Later, Cavazzano developed his own distinctive style, which marks a watershed between the traditional and the modern way of drawing Disney ducks and mice.

In his career, he has co-created numerous characters, including Queen Reginella, Humphrey Gokart, O.K. Quack, Pandy Pap (Italian name), and the most recent one, Brick Boulder. In 1981, he started drawing Disney stories for the French weekly magazine &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot; and covers for the magazines &quot;Mickey Parade&quot; and &quot;Super Picsou Géant&quot;. Since 1994, Cavazzano has been drawing covers and stories for the Scandinavian publisher Egmont, including the 2003 &quot;The Saga of Dragon Lords&quot;.

In 1999, he and the writer Tito Faraci launched the Disney noir series of &quot;MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine&quot;. Their artistic partnership led him to draw a superhero comic set in Cavazzano&#x27;s home town Venice, &quot;Il segreto del vetro&quot; (2003); this was the very first &quot;Spider-Man&quot; story realized entirely by Italian creators. This is not his only tribute to the Marvel world. The year after, Giorgio drew a cover for a special issue of &quot;Devil &amp; Hulk&quot; for the 10th anniversary of Marvel Italy.

Cavazzano has produced many non-Disney comics as well. With writer Giorgio Pezzin, Cavazzano introduced &quot;Walkie e Talkie&quot; in &quot;Il Corriere dei Piccoli&quot; (1973-1975), &quot;Oscar e Tango&quot; in &quot;Il Messagero dei Ragazzi&quot; (1974), &quot;Smalto e Johnny&quot; in &quot;Il Mago&quot; (1977), &quot;Capitan Rogers&quot; in &quot;Il Giornalino&quot; (1981-1989) and &quot;Timothée Titan&quot; in &quot;Le Journal de Mickey&quot; (1987).

With Tiziano Sclavi, the creator of &quot;Dylan Dog&quot;, Cavazzano drew the saga of &quot;Altai &amp; Jonson&quot; in 1975. He also partnered with Bonvi, the creator of &quot;Sturmtruppen&quot;, to produce &quot;Maledetta galassia&quot; and &quot;La Città&quot;, published by Sergio Bonelli Editore.

Cavazzano has contributed to the Italian tradition of &quot;Le Grandi Parodie Disney&quot;, a series of parodies of literary works, theatre, opera and cinema masterpieces. Cavazzano has drawn parodies of the films &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;La Strada&quot;, &quot;1900&quot; and &quot;The Man Without a Past&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Topolino&quot; published Bruno Enna and Giorgio Cavazzano&#x27;s homage to Hugo Pratt&#x27;s &quot;Corto Maltese&quot;: &quot;Topo Maltese: Una ballata del topo salato&quot;.

In addition to comics, Cavazzano has produced a vast amount of illustrations and advertising material, among others for Eldorado, Fiat and Xerox.

<text>Lisnaskea () is the second-biggest settlement in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. It is situated mainly in the townland of Lisoneill, with some areas in the townland of Castle Balfour Demesne, both in the civil parish of Aghalurcher and the historic barony of Magherastephana. It had a population of 3,020 people at the 2021 Census.

The nearby monument of &quot;Sciath Ghabhra&quot; is where the Maguires were crowned as kings and chiefs of Fermanagh. The town developed after the Plantation of Ulster and is built around the long main street. At the middle, the old market place, formerly known as The Diamond, contains a high cross (grid ref:H364340) from an early monastery. 19th century buildings include the former market house, corn market and butter market. The Castle Park Leisure Centre is situated just off the main street.

==History==
The name Lisnaskea comes from &quot;Lios na Scéithe&quot; meaning &quot;fort of the shield&quot;. North of the village, in the townland of Cornashee, is a large burial mound within a round enclosure, which is a scheduled monument. This is believed to be &quot;Sciath Ghabhra&quot; (Skeagoura), the coronation place of the Maguires, who were kings and chiefs of Fermanagh. Nearby is another ringfort known as &quot;Lios Uí Néill&quot; (Lisoneill). The name Lisnaskea may be a combination of the &#x27;lis&#x27; element of Lisoneill and &#x27;skea&#x27; from Skeagoura. There is also evidence of a much earlier ringfort (with radiocarbon dates of 359–428 AD) in the townland of Castle Balfour Demesne, suggesting the area was inhabited from a very early date. The ruins of the old monastery, associated with St Ronan, who died sometime before 635 AD, are to the west of the town.

In 1618, during the Plantation of Ulster, Castle Balfour was built by Scotsman James, Lord Balfour, and its remains are just off the Main Street of Lisnaskea.

In the Irish Rebellion of 1641, it was noted that: &quot;At Lissenskeah they hanged, or otherwise killed, above 100 persons, most of them of the Scottish nation&quot;. The castle was altered in 1652 and damaged in 1689, but remained inhabited into the 19th century. It was restored and conserved in the 1960s and 1990s.

The village came under the control of the Earls of Erne in 1821. They established the market in the town while bolstering and controlling development around the high street.

===The Troubles===

In December 2013, suspected dissident republicans fired shots at Lisnaskea PSNI station. There were no casualties.

===The Workhouse===

Lisnaskea Poor Law Union was formally declared on 27 June 1840, and in August Sir Arthur Brooke was elected Chairman. The workhouse was built (at a total cost of over £6,400) on a six-acre site to the south of Lisnaskea purchased from Lord Erne to accommodate 500 inmates, the first of whom were received on 25 February 1843. During 1846, the number of inmates rose from 263 to 817 by the end of the year.

In 1847, additional accommodation was erected for 130 inmates. In the early 1920s, during the &quot;Troubles&quot; of that time, the workhouse was used to house soldiers of the Royal Hampshire Regiment. The workhouse later resumed its operation until 1940 when it was used for men of the 8th Battalion of the Sherwood Foresters. The inmates were transferred to Enniskillen, and in 1948 to Armagh. Eventually, part of the workhouse was used for a time as the headquarters of Lisnaskea Fire Brigade. Later, the buildings were adapted for a mixture of residential and commercial use.

A large iron pot, said to have held 300 gallons of gruel, rested at one time in its gardens. In July 2011, part of the upper floor of the building was completely gutted in a fire, believed to be malicious.

==Sport==

Throughout the history of the Gaelic Athletic Association in Fermanagh, Lisnaskea Emmetts have consistently been a major force in Gaelic football winning 20 Fermanagh Senior Football Championship titles, ladies football and hurling. They have won a range of honours in the sport including the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football Championship in 2011, and also won the ladies&#x27; equivalent later that year. They wear red and green. Lisnaskea Emmetts over the years have had clubmen involved in the Fermanagh GAA and Ulster Railway Cup team.

<text>Heather Nova (born Heather Allison Frith, 6 July 1967) is a Bermudian singer-songwriter and poet. , she has released eleven full-length albums, six EPs and twelve singles.

==Biography==
Heather Nova was born Heather Allison Frith on Bermuda, a British overseas territory. Her mother is a native of Nova Scotia, Canada, and her father is a native of Bermuda. Nova spent most of her childhood with her family, including one sister, television reporter and fashion model Susannah, and one brother, reggae singer Mishka, on a sailboat (named &quot;Moon&quot;) built by her father, where the Friths spent most of the 1970s and part of the 1980s, sailing throughout the Atlantic and Caribbean waters and coasts. Since her idyllic childhood, Heather has played over 600 concerts, sold over 2 million albums and has a career of over 30 years in the music industry.

Nova started playing guitar and violin at an early age, writing her first song when she was 12. Nova enrolled at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where she majored in film in 1989. She also sat in on poetry classes and wrote music to go with her student films. But songwriting remained her passion.

She was married to Felix Tod from 1996 to 2014. In 2004, her son Sebastian was born.

===Career===
After graduating from RISD, Nova moved to London, a place she called home for twelve years (she already had British citizenship due to her Bermudian origins). In 1990, she released her first recording, &quot;Heather Frith&quot;, an EP; she had not yet changed her name. The new name debuted in 1993 with her second EP entitled &quot;Spirit in You&quot; and her first full album, the critically acclaimed &quot;Glow Stars&quot;, produced by Felix Tod, after being discovered by Big Cat label manager Steven Abbott. The success of the album led her to record and release her first live album &quot;Blow&quot; the same year.

In 1994, she released &quot;Oyster&quot;, her breakout album that was produced by Youth and Felix Tod and began almost two years of touring. Another live album, &quot;Live from the Milky Way&quot;, was released in 1995. &quot;Siren&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Oyster&quot; because of the hit single &quot;London Rain&quot;, was released in 1998, after which she joined Sarah McLachlan and others on the North American Lilith Fair, a music festival with only female performers. After the release of &quot;Siren&quot; and a world tour to promote the record, Nova took a break while various television show and film soundtracks licensed some of her songs and her record company (Sony Records/The WORK Group) released various singles from the album, which received only moderate play on America&#x27;s MTV2, Europe&#x27;s MTV and Canada&#x27;s MuchMusic and on mainstream radio, although she was popular on college radio. Also during this time, she recorded a version of the often covered traditional song &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot;, for the German WWII feature film drama &quot;Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod&quot; (released under the international title, &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot;). In 2000, Nova released yet another live album entitled &quot;Wonderlust&quot;.

Over the years, Nova has written and recorded over 120 songs. With the release of &quot;South&quot; (2001), she returned to the international spotlight with an appearance on the soundtrack of the John Cusack movie &quot;Serendipity&quot;. She also appeared on the soundtracks to the Sean Penn film, &quot;I Am Sam&quot;; &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot;; and &quot;The Craft&quot;. A collaboration with Swedish indiepop band Eskobar, for a song called &quot;Someone New&quot;, led to its music video being played primarily on America&#x27;s MTV. &quot;Storm&quot;, Nova&#x27;s fifth studio album, recorded with Mercury Rev as her backing band, was released in late 2003 on her own Saltwater label, went top 5 in Germany, followed by a tour during which Nova became pregnant. She quickly followed the birth of her son with her next record &quot;Redbird&quot;, released in 2005, again Top 10 in Germany.

In December 2005, Nova released &quot;Together As One&quot;, an EP supporting the Bermuda Sloop Foundation which operates the Bermuda sloop Spirit of Bermuda. In 2002, she self-published &quot;The Sorrowjoy&quot;, a 72-page book of her poetry and drawings. An album of the same name was unofficially released in March 2006, which featured Nova reading the poems from her book set to ambient music. She also collaborated with the German trance artist ATB on tracks like &quot;Love Will Find You&quot;, &quot;Feel You Like a River&quot; and the international hit &quot;Renegade&quot;. In 2008, she released an album called &quot;The Jasmine Flower&quot;, a solar powered acoustic album recorded in Bermuda, before touring as an acoustic tour.

In late 2010 she embarked on another European tour promoting her &quot;The Jasmine Flower&quot; album. On this tour, she played four unreleased songs (&quot;Save a Little Piece of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Everything Changes&quot;, &quot;Burning to Love&quot;, and &quot;Turn the Compass Round&quot;) that are included on her album, &quot;300 Days at Sea&quot;, produced by Felix Tod. This full-band album was released on 27 May 2011. In late 2014, she began working on studio album called &quot;The Way It Feels&quot; which was released in May 2015. Her tenth album, &quot;Pearl&quot;, was released on 28 June 2019.

Nova released her latest album, &quot;Other Shores&quot;, on 26 August 2022.

<doc id="78879" wikidata="Q17705" url="?curid=78879" title="Pan (moon)">
<text>Pan is the innermost named moon of Saturn. It is approximately 35 kilometres across and 23 km wide and orbits within the Encke Gap in Saturn&#x27;s A Ring. Pan is a ring shepherd and is responsible for keeping the Encke Gap free of ring particles. It is sometimes described as having the appearance of a walnut, or raviolo. 

Pan was discovered by Mark R. Showalter in 1990 from analysis of old &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe photos and received the provisional designation  because the discovery images dated back to 1981.

==Prediction and discovery==
The existence of a moon in the Encke Gap was first predicted by Jeffrey N. Cuzzi and Jeffrey D. Scargle in 1985, based on wavy edges of the gap which indicated a gravitational disturbance. In 1986, Showalter &quot;et al.&quot; inferred its orbit and mass by modeling its gravitational wake. They arrived at a precise prediction of 133,603 ± 10 km for the semi-major axis and a mass of 5–10 Saturn masses, and inferred that there was only a single moon within the Encke gap. The actual semi-major axis differs by 19 km, and the actual mass is 8.6 of Saturn&#x27;s.

The moon was later found within 1° of the predicted position. The search was undertaken by considering all &quot;Voyager 2&quot; images and using a computer calculation to predict whether the moon would be visible under sufficiently favorable conditions in each one. Every qualifying Voyager 2 image with a resolution better than ~50 km/pixel shows Pan clearly. In all, it appears in eleven &quot;Voyager 2&quot; images.

==Name==
The moon was named on 16 September 1991 after the mythological Greek god named Pan, who was (among other things) the god of shepherds. This is a reference to Pan&#x27;s role as a shepherd moon. It is also designated .

==Orbit==
The eccentricity of Pan&#x27;s orbit causes its distance from Saturn to vary by ~4 km. Its inclination, which would cause it to move up and down, is not distinguishable from zero with present data. The Encke Gap, within which Pan orbits, is about 322 km wide.

==Geography==

&quot;Cassini&quot; scientists have described Pan as &quot;walnut-shaped&quot; owing to the equatorial ridge, similar to that on Atlas, that is visible in images. The ridge is due to ring material that Pan has swept up from the Encke gap. It has been referred to by journalists as a space empanada, a form of stuffed bread or pastry, as well as a ravioli. A new study suggests that the bizarre shape of Pan could also be due to collisions between tiny moonlets, thus causing them to merge and form Pan (known as the pyramidal regime formation scenario).

==Pandean ringlet==
The Encke Gap contains a ringlet that is coincident with Pan&#x27;s orbit, indicating that Pan maintains the particles in horseshoe orbits. A second ringlet is periodically disrupted by Pan, similarly to how the F Ring is disturbed by Prometheus.

<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Pan (; ) is the god of the wild, shepherds and flocks, rustic music and impromptus, and companion of the nymphs. He has the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat, in the same manner as a faun or satyr. With his homeland in rustic Arcadia, he is also recognized as the god of fields, groves, wooded glens, and often affiliated with sex; because of this, Pan is connected to fertility and the season of spring.

In Roman religion and myth, Pan was frequently identified with Faunus, a nature god who was the father of Bona Dea, sometimes identified as Fauna; he was also closely associated with Silvanus, due to their similar relationships with woodlands, and Inuus, a vaguely-defined deity also sometimes identified with Faunus. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Pan became a significant figure in the Romantic movement of Western Europe and also in the twentieth-century Neopagan movement.
==Origins==
Many modern scholars consider Pan to be derived from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European god &quot;*Péh₂usōn&quot;, whom they believe to have been an important pastoral deity (&quot;*Péh₂usōn&quot; shares an origin with the modern English word &quot;pasture&quot;). The Rigvedic psychopomp god Pushan (from PIE zero grade &quot;*Ph₂usōn&quot;) is believed to be a cognate of Pan. The connection between Pan and Pushan, both of whom are associated with goats, was first identified in 1924 by the German scholar Hermann Collitz. The familiar form of the name Pan is contracted from earlier &quot;Πάων&quot;, derived from the root *&quot;peh₂-&quot; (guard, watch over). According to Edwin L. Brown, the name &quot;Pan&quot; is probably a cognate with the Greek word ὀπάων &quot;companion&quot;.

In his earliest appearance in literature, Pindar&#x27;s Pythian Ode iii. 78, Pan is associated with a mother goddess, perhaps Rhea or Cybele; Pindar refers to maidens worshipping Cybele and Pan near the poet&#x27;s house in Boeotia.

== Worship ==
The worship of Pan began in Arcadia which was always the principal seat of his worship. Arcadia was a district of mountain people, culturally separated from other Greeks. Arcadian hunters used to scourge the statue of the god if they had been disappointed in the chase.

Being a rustic god, Pan was not worshipped in temples or other built edifices, but in natural settings, usually caves or grottoes such as the one on the north slope of the Acropolis of Athens. These are often referred to as the Cave of Pan. The only exceptions are the Sanctuary of Pan on the Neda River gorge in the southwestern Peloponnese – the ruins of which survive to this day – and the Temple of Pan at Apollonopolis Magna in ancient Egypt. In the fourth century BC Pan was depicted on the coinage of Pantikapaion.

Archaeologists, while excavating a Byzantine church of around 400 AD in Banyas, discovered in the walls of the church an altar of the god Pan with a Greek inscription, dating back to the second or third century AD. The inscription reads, &quot;Atheneon son of Sosipatros of Antioch is dedicating the altar to the god Pan Heliopolitanus. He built the altar using his own personal money in fulfillment of a vow he made.&quot;

In the mystery cults of the highly syncretic Hellenistic era, Pan is identified with Phanes/Protogonos, Zeus, Dionysus and Eros.
=== Epithets ===

* Aegocerus () was an epithet of Pan descriptive of his figure with the horns of a goat.
* Lyterius (), meaning &quot;Deliverer&quot;. There was a sanctuary at Troezen, and he had this epithet because he was believed during a plague to have revealed in dreams the proper remedy against the disease.
* Maenalius () or Maenalides (), derived from mount Maenalus which was sacred to the god.
== Parentage ==


Numerous different parentages are given for Pan by different authors. According to the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Pan&quot;, he is the child of Hermes and an (unnamed) daughter of Dryops. Several authors state that Pan is the son of Hermes and &quot;Penelope&quot;, apparently Penelope, the wife of Odysseus: according to Herodotus, this was the version which was believed by the Greeks, and later sources such as Cicero and Hyginus call Pan the son of Mercury and Penelope. In some early sources such as Pindar (c. 518 – c. 438 BC) and Hecataeus (c. 550 – c. 476 BC), he is called the child of Penelope by Apollo. Apollodorus records two distinct divinities named Pan; one who was the son of Hermes and Penelope, and the other who had Zeus and a nymph named Hybris for his parents, and was the mentor of Apollo. Pausanias records the story that Penelope had in fact been unfaithful to her husband, who banished her to Mantineia upon his return. Other sources (Duris of Samos; the Vergilian commentator Servius) report that Penelope slept with all 108 suitors in Odysseus&#x27; absence, and gave birth to Pan as a result. This myth reflects the folk etymology that equates Pan&#x27;s name (Πάν) with the Greek word for &quot;all&quot; (πᾶν). According to Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&quot;, Apollodorus has his parents as Hermes and Oeneis, while scholia on Theocritus have Aether and Oeneis.

Like other nature spirits, Pan appears to be older than the Olympians, if it is true that he gave Artemis her hunting dogs and taught the secret of prophecy to Apollo. Pan might be multiplied as the Pans (Burkert 1985, III.3.2; Ruck and Staples, 1994, p. 132) or the &quot;Paniskoi&quot;. Kerenyi (p. 174) notes from scholia that Aeschylus in &quot;Rhesus&quot; distinguished between two Pans, one the son of Zeus and twin of Arcas, and one a son of Cronus. &quot;In the retinue of Dionysos, or in depictions of wild landscapes, there appeared not only a great Pan, but also little Pans, Paniskoi, who played the same part as the Satyrs&quot;.

Herodotus wrote that according to Egyptian chronology, Pan was the most ancient of the gods; but according to the version in which Pan was the son of Hermes and Penelope, he was born only eight hundred years before Herodotus, and thus after the Trojan war. Herodotus concluded that that would be when the Greeks first learnt the name of Pan.

== Mythology ==
=== Battle with Typhon ===
The goat-god Aegipan was nurtured by Amalthea with the infant Zeus in Crete. In Zeus&#x27; battle with Typhon, Aegipan and Hermes stole back Zeus&#x27; &quot;sinews&quot; that Typhon had hidden away in the Corycian Cave. Pan aided his foster-brother in the battle with the Titans by letting out a horrible screech and scattering them in terror. According to some traditions, Aegipan was the son of Pan, rather than his father. The constellation Capricornus is traditionally depicted as a sea-goat, a goat with a fish&#x27;s tail (see &quot;Goatlike&quot; Aigaion called Briareos, one of the Hecatonchires). A myth reported as &quot;Egyptian&quot; in Hyginus&#x27;s &quot;Poetic Astronomy&quot; (which would seem to be invented to justify a connection of Pan with Capricorn) says that when Aegipan—that is Pan in his goat-god aspect—was attacked by the monster Typhon, he dived into the river Nile; the parts above the water remained a goat, but those under the water transformed into a fish.

=== Erotic aspects ===
Pan is famous for his sexual prowess and is often depicted with a phallus. Diogenes of Sinope, speaking in jest, related a myth of Pan learning masturbation from his father, Hermes, and teaching the habit to shepherds.

There was a legend that Pan seduced the moon goddess Selene, deceiving her with a sheep&#x27;s fleece.

One of the famous myths of Pan involves the origin of his pan flute, fashioned from lengths of hollow reed. Syrinx was a lovely wood-nymph of Arcadia, daughter of Ladon, the river-god. As she was returning from the hunt one day, Pan met her. To escape from his importunities, the fair nymph ran away and didn&#x27;t stop to hear his compliments. He pursued from Mount Lycaeum until she came to her sisters who immediately changed her into a reed. When the air blew through the reeds, it produced a plaintive melody. The god, still infatuated, took some of the reeds, because he could not identify which reed she became, and cut seven pieces (or according to some versions, nine), joined them side by side in gradually decreasing lengths, and formed the musical instrument bearing the name of his beloved Syrinx. Henceforth, Pan was seldom seen without it.

Echo was a nymph who was a great singer and dancer and scorned the love of any man. This angered Pan, a lecherous god, and he instructed his followers to kill her. Echo was torn to pieces and spread all over Earth. The goddess of the Earth, Gaia, received the pieces of Echo, whose voice remains repeating the last words of others. In some versions, Echo and Pan had two children: Iambe and Iynx. In other versions, Pan had fallen in love with Echo, but she scorned the love of any man but was enraptured by Narcissus. As Echo was cursed by Hera to only be able to repeat words that had been said by someone else, she could not speak for herself. She followed Narcissus to a pool, where he fell in love with his own reflection and changed into a narcissus flower. Echo wasted away, but her voice could still be heard in caves and other such similar places.

Pan also loved a nymph named Pitys, who was turned into a pine tree to escape him. In another version, Pan and the north wind god Boreas clashed over the lovely Pitys. Boreas uprooted all the trees to impress her, but Pan laughed and Pitys chose him. Boreas then chased her and threw her off a cliff resulting in her death. Gaia pitied Pitys and turned her into a pine tree.

According to some traditions, Pan taught Daphnis, a rustic son of Hermes, how to play the pan-pipes, and also fell in love with him.

Women who had had sexual relations with several men were referred to as &quot;Pan girls.&quot;

=== Panic ===
Disturbed in his secluded afternoon naps, Pan&#x27;s angry shout inspired panic (&quot;panikon deima&quot;) in lonely places. Following the Titans&#x27; assault on Olympus, Pan claimed credit for the victory of the gods because he had frightened the attackers. In the Battle of Marathon (490 BC), it is said that Pan favored the Athenians and so inspired panic in the hearts of their enemies, the Persians.

=== Music ===
In two late Roman sources, Hyginus and Ovid, Pan is substituted for the satyr Marsyas in the theme of a musical competition (&quot;agon&quot;), and the punishment by flaying is omitted.

Pan once had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and to challenge Apollo, the god of the lyre, to a trial of skill. Tmolus, the mountain-god, was chosen to judge. Pan blew on his pipes and gave great satisfaction with his rustic melody to himself and to his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but Midas agreed with the judgment. Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and turned Midas&#x27; ears into those of a donkey.

=== All of the Pans ===

Pan could be multiplied into a swarm of Pans, and even be given individual names, as in Nonnus&#x27; &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, where the god Pan had twelve sons that helped Dionysus in his war against the Indians. Their names were Kelaineus, Argennon, Aigikoros, Eugeneios, Omester, Daphoenus, Phobos, Philamnos, Xanthos, Glaukos, Argos, and Phorbas.

Two other Pans were Agreus and Nomios. Both were the sons of Hermes, Agreus&#x27; mother being the nymph Sose, a prophetess: he inherited his mother&#x27;s gift of prophecy, and was also a skilled hunter. Nomios&#x27; mother was Penelope (not the same as the wife of Odysseus). He was an excellent shepherd, seducer of nymphs, and musician upon the shepherd&#x27;s pipes. Most of the mythological stories about Pan are actually about Nomios, not the god Pan. Although, Agreus and Nomios could have been two different aspects of the prime Pan, reflecting his dual nature as both a wise prophet and a lustful beast.

Aegipan, literally &quot;goat-Pan,&quot; was a Pan who was fully goatlike, rather than half-goat and half-man. When the Olympians fled from the monstrous giant Typhoeus and hid themselves in animal form, Aegipan assumed the form of a fish-tailed goat. Later he came to the aid of Zeus in his battle with Typhoeus, by stealing back Zeus&#x27; stolen sinews. As a reward the king of the gods placed him amongst the stars as the Constellation Capricorn. The mother of Aegipan, Aix (the goat), was perhaps associated with the constellation Capra.

Sybarios was an Italian Pan who was worshipped in the Greek colony of Sybaris in Italy. The Sybarite Pan was conceived when a Sybarite shepherd boy named Krathis copulated with a pretty she-goat amongst his herds.

==&quot;The great god Pan is dead&quot;==

In Pseudo-Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;De defectu oraculorum&quot; (&quot;The Obsolescence of Oracles&quot;), Pan is the only Greek god who actually dies. During the reign of Tiberius (AD 14–37), the news of Pan&#x27;s death came to one Thamus, a sailor on his way to Italy by way of the Greek island of Paxi. A divine voice hailed him across the salt water, &quot;Thamus, are you there? When you reach Palodes, take care to proclaim that the great god Pan is dead.&quot; Which Thamus did, and the news was greeted from shore with groans and laments.

Christian apologists, including Eusebius of Caesarea, have long made much of Plutarch&#x27;s story of the death of Pan. Due to the word &quot;all&quot; in Greek also being &quot;pan,&quot; a pun was made that &quot;all demons&quot; had perished.

In Rabelais&#x27; &quot;Fourth Book of Pantagruel&quot; (sixteenth century), the Giant Pantagruel, after recollecting the tale as told by Plutarch, opines that the announcement was actually about the death of Jesus Christ, which did take place at about the same time (towards the end of Tiberius&#x27; reign), noting the aptness of the name: &quot;for he may lawfully be said in the Greek tongue to be Pan, since he is our all. For all that we are, all that we live, all that we have, all that we hope, is him, by him, from him, and in him.&quot; In this interpretation, Rabelais was following Guillaume Postel in his &quot;De orbis terrae concordia&quot;.

The nineteenth-century visionary Anne Catherine Emmerich, in a twist echoed nowhere else, claims that the phrase &quot;the Great Pan&quot; was actually a demonic epithet for Jesus Christ, and that &quot;Thamus, or Tramus&quot; was a watchman in the port of Nicaea, who, at the time of the other spectacular events surrounding Christ&#x27;s death, was then commissioned to spread this message, which was later garbled &quot;in repetition.&quot;

In modern times, G. K. Chesterton has repeated and amplified the significance of the &quot;death&quot; of Pan, suggesting that with the &quot;death&quot; of Pan came the advent of theology. To this effect, Chesterton claimed, &quot;It is said truly in a sense that Pan died because Christ was born. It is almost as true in another sense that men knew that Christ was born because Pan was already dead. A void was made by the vanishing world of the whole mythology of mankind, which would have asphyxiated like a vacuum if it had not been filled with theology.&quot; It was interpreted with concurrent meanings in all four modes of medieval &quot;exegesis&quot;: literally as historical fact, and allegorically as the death of the ancient order at the coming of the new.

In more modern times, some have suggested a possible naturalistic explanation for the myth. For example, Robert Graves (&quot;The Greek Myths&quot;) reported a suggestion that had been made by Salomon Reinach and expanded by James S. Van Teslaar that the sailors actually heard the excited shouts of the worshipers of Tammuz, (, &quot;All-great Tammuz is dead!&quot;), and misinterpreted them as a message directed to an Egyptian sailor named &#x27;Thamus&#x27;: &quot;Great Pan is Dead!&quot; Van Teslaar explains, &quot;[i]n its true form the phrase would have probably carried no meaning to those on board who must have been unfamiliar with the worship of Tammuz which was a transplanted, and for those parts, therefore, an exotic custom.&quot; Certainly, when Pausanias toured Greece about a century after Plutarch, he found Pan&#x27;s shrines, sacred caves and sacred mountains still very much frequented. However, a naturalistic explanation might not be needed. For example, William Hansen has shown that the story is quite similar to a class of widely known tales known as &quot;Fairies Send a Message.&quot;

The cry &quot;The Great Pan is dead&quot; has appealed to poets, such as John Milton, in his ecstatic celebration of Christian peace, &quot;On the Morning of Christ&#x27;s Nativity&quot; line 89, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Louisa May Alcott.

==Influence==
=== Iconography ===
Representations of Pan have influenced conventional popular depictions of the Devil.
===Literary revival===

In the late-eighteenth century, interest in Pan revived among liberal scholars. Richard Payne Knight discussed Pan in his &quot;Discourse on the Worship of Priapus&quot; (1786) as a symbol of creation expressed through sexuality. &quot;Pan is represented pouring water upon the organ of generation; that is, invigorating the active creative power by the prolific element.&quot;

John Keats&#x27;s &quot;Endymion&quot; (1818) opens with a festival dedicated to Pan where a stanzaic hymn is sung in praise of him. Keats drew most of his account of Pan&#x27;s activities from the Elizabethan poets. Douglas Bush notes, &quot;The goat-god, the tutelary divinity of shepherds, had long been allegorized on various levels, from Christ to &#x27;Universall Nature&#x27; (Sandys); here he becomes the symbol of the romantic imagination, of supra-mortal knowledge.

In the late-nineteenth century Pan became an increasingly common figure in literature and art. Patricia Merivale states that between 1890 and 1926 there was an &quot;astonishing resurgence of interest in the Pan motif&quot;. He appears in poetry, in novels and children&#x27;s books, and is referenced in the name of the character Peter Pan. In the Peter Pan stories, Peter represents a golden age of pre-civilisation in both the minds of very young children (before enculturation and education), and in the natural world outside the influence of humans. Peter Pan&#x27;s character is both charming and selfish - emphasizing our cultural confusion about whether human instincts are natural and good, or uncivilised and bad. J. M. Barrie describes Peter as &#x27;a betwixt and between&#x27;, part animal and part human, and uses this device to explore many issues of human and animal psychology within the Peter Pan stories.

Arthur Machen&#x27;s 1894 novella &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; uses the god&#x27;s name in a simile about the whole world being revealed as it really is: &quot;seeing the Great God Pan&quot;. The novella is considered by many (including Stephen King) as being one of the greatest horror-stories ever written.

In an article in &quot;Hellebore&quot; magazine, Melissa Edmundson argues that women writers from the nineteenth century used the figure of Pan &quot;to reclaim agency in texts that explored female empowerment and sexual liberation&quot;. In Eleanor Farjeon&#x27;s poem &quot;Pan-Worship&quot;, the speaker tries to summon Pan to life after feeling &quot;a craving in me&quot;, wishing for a &quot;spring-tide&quot; that will replace the stagnant &quot;autumn&quot; of the soul. A dark version of Pan&#x27;s seductiveness appears in Margery Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Robin&#x27;s Rath&quot;, both giving and taking life and vitality.

Pan is the eponymous &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; in the seventh chapter of Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; (1908). Grahame&#x27;s Pan, unnamed but clearly recognisable, is a powerful but secretive nature-god, protector of animals, who casts a spell of forgetfulness on all those he helps. He makes a brief appearance to help Rat and Mole recover the Otter&#x27;s lost son Portly.

The goat-footed god entices villagers to listen to his pipes as if in a trance in Lord Dunsany&#x27;s novel &quot;The Blessing of Pan&quot; (1927). Although the god does not appear within the story, his energy invokes the younger folk of the village to revel in the summer twilight, while the vicar of the village is the only person worried about the revival of worship of the old pagan god.

Pan features as a prominent character in Tom Robbins&#x27; &quot;Jitterbug Perfume&quot; (1984).

The British writer and editor Mark Beech of Egaeus Press published in 2015 the limited-edition anthology &quot;Soliloquy for Pan&quot; which includes essays and poems such as &quot;The Rebirthing of Pan&quot; by Adrian Eckersley, &quot;Pan&#x27;s Pipes&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson, &quot;Pan with Us&quot; by Robert Frost, and &quot;The Death of Pan&quot; by Lord Dunsany. Some of the detailed illustrated depictions of Pan included in the volume are by the artists Giorgio Ghisi, Sir James Thornhill, Bernard Picart, Agostino Veneziano, Vincenzo Cartari, and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.

In the Percy Jackson novels, author Rick Riordan uses &quot;The Great God Pan is dead&quot; quote as a plot point in the novel &quot;The Sea of Monsters&quot;, and in &quot;The Battle of the Labyrinth&quot; Pan is revealed to be in a state of half-death.

=== Revival in music ===
Pan inspired pieces of classical music by Claude Debussy. &quot;Syrinx&quot;, written as part of incidental music to the play &quot;Psyché&quot; by Gabriel Mourey, was originally called &quot;Flûte de Pan&quot;. &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; was based on a poem by Stéphane Mallarmé.

The story of Pan is the inspiration for the first movement in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s work for solo oboe, Six Metamorphoses after Ovid first performed in 1951. Inspired by characters from Ovid&#x27;s fifteen-volume work Metamorphoses, Britten titled the movement, &quot;Pan: who played upon the reed pipe which was Syrinx, his beloved.&quot;

The British rock band Pink Floyd named its first album &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; in reference to Pan as he appears in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;. Andrew King, Pink Floyd&#x27;s manager, said Syd Barrett &quot;thought Pan had given him an understanding into the way nature works. It formed into his holistic view of the world.&quot;

Brian Jones, a founding member of The Rolling Stones, strongly identified with Pan. He produced the live album &quot;Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka&quot;, about a Moroccan festival that evoked the ancient Roman rites of Pan.

Musician Mike Scott of the Waterboys refers to Pan as an archetypal force within us all, and talks about his search for “The Pan Within&quot;, a theme also reflected in the song’s sequel, “The Return of Pan&quot;.

=== Revived worship ===
In the English town of Painswick in Gloucestershire, a group of eighteenth-century gentry, led by Benjamin Hyett, organised an annual procession dedicated to Pan, during which a statue of the deity was held aloft, and people shouted &quot;Highgates! Highgates!&quot; Hyett also erected temples and follies to Pan in the gardens of his house and a &quot;Pan&#x27;s lodge&quot;, located over Painswick Valley. The tradition died out in the 1830s, but was revived in 1885 by a new vicar, W. H. Seddon, who mistakenly believed that the festival had been ancient in origin. One of Seddon&#x27;s successors, however, was less appreciative of the pagan festival and put an end to it in 1950, when he had Pan&#x27;s statue buried.

Occultists Aleister Crowley and Victor Neuburg built an altar to Pan on Da&#x27;leh Addin, a mountain in Algeria, where they performed a magic ceremony to summon the god. In the final rite of the 1910 ritual play &quot;The Rites of Eleusis&quot;, written by Crowley, Pan &quot;pulls back the final veil, revealing the child Horus, who represents humanity&#x27;s eternal and divine element.&quot;

=== Neopaganism ===
In 1933, the Egyptologist Margaret Murray published the book &quot;The God of the Witches&quot;, in which she theorised that Pan was merely one form of a horned god who was worshipped across Europe by a witch-cult. This theory influenced the Neopagan notion of the Horned God, as an archetype of male virility and sexuality. In Wicca, the archetype of the Horned God is highly important, as represented by such deities as the Celtic Cernunnos, the Hindu Pashupati, and the Greek Pan.

<text>The genus Pan consists of two extant species: the chimpanzee and the bonobo. Taxonomically, these two ape species are collectively termed panins. The two species were formerly collectively called &quot;chimpanzees&quot; or &quot;chimps&quot;; if bonobos were recognized as a separate group at all, they were referred to as &quot;pygmy&quot; or &quot;gracile chimpanzees&quot;. Together with humans, gorillas, and orangutans they are part of the family Hominidae (the great apes, or &quot;hominids&quot;). Native to sub-Saharan Africa, chimpanzees and bonobos are currently both found in the Congo jungle, while only the chimpanzee is also found further north in West Africa. Both species are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and in 2017 the Convention on Migratory Species selected the chimpanzee for special protection.

== Chimpanzee and bonobo: comparison ==
The chimpanzee (&quot;P. troglodytes&quot;), which lives north of the Congo River, and the bonobo (&quot;P. paniscus&quot;), which lives south of it, were once considered to be the same species, but since 1928 they have been recognized as distinct. In addition, &quot;P. troglodytes&quot; is divided into four subspecies, while &quot;P. paniscus&quot; is undivided. Based on genome sequencing, these two extant &quot;Pan&quot; species diverged around one million years ago.

The most obvious differences are that chimpanzees are somewhat larger, more aggressive and male-dominated, while the bonobos are more gracile, peaceful, and female-dominated. Their hair is typically black or brown. Males and females differ in size and appearance. Both chimpanzees and bonobos are some of the most social great apes, with social bonds occurring throughout large communities. Fruit is the most important component of a chimpanzee&#x27;s diet; but they will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and even other chimpanzees or monkeys. They can live over 30 years in both the wild and captivity.

Chimpanzees and bonobos are equally humanity&#x27;s closest living relatives. They use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. Their learning abilities have been extensively studied. There may even be distinctive cultures within populations. Field studies of &quot;Pan troglodytes&quot; were pioneered by primatologist Jane Goodall.

==Names==
The genus name &quot;Pan&quot; was first introduced by Lorenz Oken in 1816. While Oken did not give a rationale for his choice, it is generally thought to have been inspired by the name of the Greek god Pan. An alternative &quot;Theranthropus&quot; was suggested by Brookes 1828 and &quot;Chimpansee&quot; by Voigt 1831. &quot;Troglodytes&quot; was not available, as it had been given as the name of a genus of wren in 1809, for &quot;cave-dweller&quot;, reflecting the tendency of some wrens to forage in dark crevices. The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature adopted &quot;Pan&quot; as the only official name of the genus in 1895, though the &quot;cave-dweller&quot; connection was able to be included, albeit at the species level (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot; – the common chimpanzee) for one of the two species of &quot;Pan&quot;. 

The first use of the name &quot;chimpanze&quot; is recorded in &quot;The London Magazine&quot; in 1738, glossed as meaning &quot;mockman&quot; in a language of &quot;the Angolans&quot; (apparently from a Bantu language; reportedly modern Vili (Civili), a Zone H Bantu language, has the comparable &quot;ci-mpenzi&quot;). The spelling &quot;chimpanzee&quot; is found in a 1758 supplement to &quot;Chamber&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot;. The colloquialism &quot;chimp&quot; was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s.

The chimpanzee was named &quot;Simia troglodytes&quot; by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1776. The species name &quot;troglodytes&quot; is a reference to the &quot;Troglodytae&quot; (literally &quot;cave-goers&quot;), an African people described by Greco-Roman geographers. Blumenbach first used it in his &quot;De generis humani varietate nativa liber&quot; (&quot;On the natural varieties of the human genus&quot;) in 1776, Linnaeus 1758 had already used &quot;Homo troglodytes&quot; for a hypothetical mixture of human and orangutan.

The bonobo, in the past also referred to as the &quot;pygmy chimpanzee&quot;, was given the species name of &quot;paniscus&quot; by Ernst Schwarz (1929), a of the theonym &quot;Pan&quot; used by Cicero.

==Distribution and habitat==
There are two species of the genus &quot;Pan&quot;, both previously called simply chimpanzees: 
# Chimpanzees or &quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;, are found almost exclusively in the heavily forested regions of Central and West Africa. With at least four commonly accepted subspecies, their population and distribution is much more extensive than the bonobos, in the past also called &#x27;pygmy chimpanzee&#x27;. 
# Bonobos, &quot;Pan paniscus&quot;, are found only in Central Africa, south of the Congo River and north of the Kasai River (a tributary of the Congo), in the humid forest of the Democratic Republic of Congo of Central Africa.


==Evolutionary history==
===Evolutionary relationship===

The genus &quot;Pan&quot; is part of the subfamily Homininae, to which humans also belong. The lineages of chimpanzees and humans separated in a process of speciation between roughly five to twelve million years ago, making them humanity&#x27;s closest living relative. Research by Mary-Claire King in 1973 found 99% identical DNA between human beings and chimpanzees. For some time, research modified that finding to about 94% commonality, with some of the difference occurring in noncoding DNA, but more recent knowledge puts the difference in DNA between humans, chimpanzees and bonobos at just about 1%–1.2% again.

===Fossils===
The chimpanzee fossil record has long been absent and thought to have been due to the preservation bias in relation to their environment. However, in 2005, chimpanzee fossils were discovered and described by Sally McBrearty and colleagues. Existing chimpanzee populations in West and Central Africa are separate from the major human fossil sites in East Africa; however, chimpanzee fossils have been reported from Kenya, indicating that both humans and members of the &quot;Pan&quot; clade were present in the East African Rift Valley during the Middle Pleistocene.

==Anatomy and physiology==

The chimpanzee&#x27;s arms are longer than its legs. The male common chimp stands up to high. Male adult wild chimps weigh between 40 and 60 kg with females weighing between 27 and 50 kg. When extended, the common chimp&#x27;s long arms span one and a half times the body&#x27;s height. The bonobo is slightly shorter and thinner than the common chimpanzee, but has longer limbs. In trees, both species climb with their long, powerful arms; on the ground, chimpanzees usually knuckle-walk, or walk on all fours, clenching their fists and supporting themselves on the knuckles. Chimpanzees are better suited for walking than orangutans, because the chimp&#x27;s feet have broader soles and shorter toes. The bonobo has proportionately longer upper limbs and walks upright more often than does the common chimpanzee. Both species can walk upright on two legs when carrying objects with their hands and arms.
The chimpanzee is tailless; its coat is dark; its face, fingers, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet are hairless. The exposed skin of the face, hands, and feet varies from pink to very dark in both species, but is generally lighter in younger individuals and darkens with maturity. A University of Chicago Medical Centre study has found significant genetic differences between chimpanzee populations. A bony shelf over the eyes gives the forehead a receding appearance, and the nose is flat. Although the jaws protrude, a chimp&#x27;s lips are thrust out only when it pouts.

The brain of a chimpanzee has been measured at a general range of 282–500 cm3. The human brain, in contrast, is about three times larger, with a reported average volume of about 1330 cm3.
Chimpanzees reach puberty between the age of eight and ten years. A chimpanzee&#x27;s testicles are unusually large for its body size, with a combined weight of about compared to a gorilla&#x27;s or a human&#x27;s . This relatively great size is generally attributed to sperm competition due to the polygynandrous nature of chimpanzee mating behaviour. Unlike gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos have long and filiform penises without a glans.

==Longevity==
In the wild, chimpanzees live to their 30s, while some captured chimps have reached an age of 70 years and older.

===Muscle strength===

Chimpanzees are known for possessing great amount of muscle strength, especially in their arms. However, compared to humans the amount of strength reported in media and popular science is greatly exaggerated with numbers of four to eight times the muscle strength of a human. These numbers stem from two studies in 1923 and 1926 by a biologist named John Bauman. These studies were refuted in 1943 and an adult male chimpanzee was found to pull about the same weight as an adult man. Corrected for their smaller body sizes, chimpanzees were found to be stronger than humans but not anywhere near four to eight times. In the 1960s these tests were repeated and chimpanzees were found to have twice the strength of a human when it came to pulling weights. The reason for the higher strength seen in chimpanzees compared to humans are thought to come from longer skeletal muscle fibers that can generate twice the work output over a wider range of motion compared to skeletal muscle fibers in humans.

==Behaviour==
It is suspected that human observers can influence chimpanzee behaviour. For this reason researchers sometimes prefer camera traps and remote microphones rather than human observers.

===Chimpanzee vs. bonobo===

Anatomical differences between the common chimpanzee and the bonobo are slight. Both are omnivorous adapted to a mainly frugivorous diet. Yet sexual and social behaviours are markedly different. The common chimpanzee has a troop culture based on beta males led by an alpha male, and highly complex social relationships. The bonobo, on the other hand, has egalitarian, nonviolent, matriarchal, sexually receptive behaviour. Bonobos frequently have sex, sometimes to help prevent and resolve conflicts. Different groups of chimpanzees also have different cultural behaviour with preferences for types of tools. The common chimpanzee tends to display greater aggression than does the bonobo. The average captive chimpanzee sleeps 9 hours and 42 minutes per day.

Contrary to what the scientific name (&quot;Pan&quot; &quot;troglodytes&quot;) may suggest, chimpanzees do not typically spend their time in caves, but there have been reports of some of them seeking refuge in caves because of the heat during daytime.

===Chimpanzees===

====Social structure====

Chimpanzees live in large multi-male and multi-female social groups, which are called communities. Within a community, the position of an individual and the influence the individual has on others dictates a definite social hierarchy. Chimpanzees live in a leaner hierarchy wherein more than one individual may be dominant enough to dominate other members of lower rank. Typically, a dominant male is referred to as the alpha male. The alpha male is the highest-ranking male that controls the group and maintains order during disputes. In chimpanzee society, the &#x27;dominant male&#x27; sometimes is not the largest or strongest male but rather the most manipulative and political male that can influence the goings on within a group. Male chimpanzees typically attain dominance by cultivating allies who will support that individual during future ambitions for power. The alpha male regularly displays by puffing his normally slim coat up to increase view size and charge to seem as threatening and as powerful as possible; this behaviour serves to intimidate other members and thereby maintain power and authority, and it may be fundamental to the alpha male&#x27;s holding on to his status. Lower-ranking chimpanzees will show respect by submissively gesturing in body language or reaching out their hands while grunting. Female chimpanzees will show deference to the alpha male by presenting their hindquarters.
Female chimpanzees also have a hierarchy, which is influenced by the position of a female individual within a group. In some chimpanzee communities, the young females may inherit high status from a high-ranking mother. Dominant females will also ally to dominate lower-ranking females: whereas males mainly seek dominant status for its associated mating privileges and sometimes violent domination of subordinates, females seek dominant status to acquire resources such as food, as high-ranking females often have first access to them. Both genders acquire dominant status to improve social standing within a group.

Community female acceptance is necessary for alpha male status; females must ensure that their group visits places that supply them with enough food. A group of dominant females will sometimes oust an alpha male which is not to their preference and back another male, in whom they see potential for leading the group as a successful alpha male.

The mating system within each community is polygynandrous, with each male and female possibly having multiple sexual partners.

====Intelligence====

Chimpanzees make tools and use them to acquire foods and for social displays; they have sophisticated hunting strategies requiring cooperation, influence and rank; they are status conscious, manipulative and capable of deception; they can learn to use symbols and understand aspects of human language including some relational syntax, concepts of number and numerical sequence; and they are capable of spontaneous planning for a future state or event.

====Tool use====

In October 1960, Jane Goodall observed the use of tools among chimpanzees. Recent research indicates that chimpanzees&#x27; use of stone tools dates back at least 4,300 years (about 2,300 BC). One example of chimpanzee tool usage behavior includes the use of a large stick as a tool to dig into termite mounds, and the subsequent use of a small stick altered into a tool that is used to &quot;fish&quot; the termites out of the mound. Chimpanzees are also known to use smaller stones as hammers and a large one as an anvil in order to break open nuts.

In the 1970s, reports of chimpanzees using rocks or sticks as weapons were anecdotal and controversial. However, a 2007 study claimed to reveal the use of spears, which common chimpanzees in Senegal sharpen with their teeth and use to stab and pry Senegal bushbabies out of small holes in trees.

Prior to the discovery of tool use by chimpanzees, humans were believed to be the only species to make and use tools; however, several other tool-using species are now known.

====Nest-building====
Nest-building, sometimes considered to be a form of tool use, is seen when chimpanzees construct arboreal night nests by lacing together branches from one or more trees to build a safe, comfortable place to sleep; infants learn this process by watching their mothers. The nest provides a sort of mattress, which is supported by strong branches for a foundation, and then lined with softer leaves and twigs; the minimum diameter is and may be located at a height of . Both day and night nests are built, and may be located in groups. A study in 2014 found that the muhimbi tree is favoured for nest building by chimpanzees in Uganda due to its physical properties, such as bending strength, inter-node distance, and leaf surface area.

====Altruism and emotivity====

Studies have shown chimpanzees engage in apparently altruistic behaviour within groups. Some researchers have suggested that chimpanzees are indifferent to the welfare of unrelated group members, but a more recent study of wild chimpanzees found that both male and female adults would adopt orphaned young of their group. Also, different groups sometimes share food, form coalitions, and cooperate in hunting and border patrolling. Sometimes, chimpanzees have adopted young that come from unrelated groups. And in some rare cases, even male chimpanzees have been shown to take care of abandoned infant chimpanzees of an unrelated group, though in most cases they would kill the infant.

According to a literature summary by James W. Harrod, evidence for chimpanzee emotivity includes display of mourning; &quot;incipient romantic love&quot;; &quot;rain dances&quot;; appreciation of natural beauty (such as a sunset over a lake); curiosity and respect towards other wildlife (such as the python, which is neither a threat nor a food source to chimpanzees); altruism toward other species (such as feeding turtles); and animism, or &quot;pretend play&quot;, when chimpanzees cradle and groom rocks or sticks.

====Communication between chimpanzees====

Chimpanzees communicate in a manner that is similar to that of human nonverbal communication, using vocalizations, hand gestures, and facial expressions. There is some evidence that they can recreate human speech. Research into the chimpanzee brain has revealed that when chimpanzees communicate, an area in the brain is activated which is in the same position as the language center called Broca&#x27;s area in human brains.

====Aggression====

Adult common chimpanzees, particularly males, can be very aggressive. They are highly territorial and are known to kill others of their species.

====Hunting====

Chimpanzees also engage in targeted hunting of smaller primates, such as the red colobus and bush babies. Males who acquire the meat may share it with females to have sex or for grooming.

====Puzzle solving====

In February 2013, a study found that chimpanzees solve puzzles for entertainment.

==Chimpanzees in human history==
Chimpanzees, as well as other apes, had also been purported to have been known to ancient writers, but mainly as myths and legends on the edge of European and Near Eastern societal consciousness. Apes are mentioned variously by Aristotle. The English word &quot;ape&quot; translates Hebrew &quot;קוף (qof)&quot; in English translations of the Bible (1 Kings 10:22), but the word may refer to a monkey rather than an ape proper.

The diary of Portuguese explorer Duarte Pacheco Pereira (1506), preserved in the Portuguese National Archive (&quot;Torre do Tombo&quot;), is probably the first written document to acknowledge that chimpanzees built their own rudimentary tools. The first of these early transcontinental chimpanzees came from Angola and were presented as a gift to Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange in 1640, and were followed by a few of its brethren over the next several years. Scientists described these first chimpanzees as &quot;pygmies&quot;, and noted the animals&#x27; distinct similarities to humans. The next two decades, a number of the creatures were imported into Europe, mainly acquired by various zoological gardens as entertainment for visitors.
Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection (published in 1859) spurred scientific interest in chimpanzees, as in much of life science, leading eventually to numerous studies of the animals in the wild and captivity. The observers of chimpanzees at the time were mainly interested in behaviour as it related to that of humans. This was less strictly and disinterestedly scientific than it might sound, with much attention being focused on whether or not the animals had traits that could be considered &#x27;good&#x27;; the intelligence of chimpanzees was often significantly exaggerated, as immortalized in Hugo Rheinhold&#x27;s &quot;Affe mit Schädel&quot; (see image, left). By the end of the 19th century, chimpanzees remained very much a mystery to humans, with very little factual scientific information available.

In the 20th century, a new age of scientific research into chimpanzee behaviour began. Before 1960, almost nothing was known about chimpanzee behaviour in their natural habitats. In July of that year, Jane Goodall set out to Tanzania&#x27;s Gombe forest to live among the chimpanzees, where she primarily studied the members of the Kasakela chimpanzee community. Her discovery that chimpanzees made and used tools was groundbreaking, as humans were previously believed to be the only species to do so. The most progressive early studies on chimpanzees were spearheaded primarily by Wolfgang Köhler and Robert Yerkes, both of whom were renowned psychologists. Both men and their colleagues established laboratory studies of chimpanzees focused specifically on learning about the intellectual abilities of chimpanzees, particularly problem-solving. This typically involved basic, practical tests on laboratory chimpanzees, which required a fairly high intellectual capacity (such as how to solve the problem of acquiring an out-of-reach banana). Notably, Yerkes also made extensive observations of chimpanzees in the wild which added tremendously to the scientific understanding of chimpanzees and their behaviour. Yerkes studied chimpanzees until World War II, while Köhler concluded five years of study and published his famous &quot;Mentality of Apes&quot; in 1925 (which is coincidentally when Yerkes began his analyses), eventually concluding, &quot;chimpanzees manifest intelligent behaviour of the general kind familiar in human beings ... a type of behaviour which counts as specifically human&quot; (1925).
The August 2008 issue of the &quot;American Journal of Primatology&quot; reported results of a year-long study of chimpanzees in Tanzania&#x27;s Mahale Mountains National Park, which produced evidence of chimpanzees becoming sick from viral infectious diseases they had likely contracted from humans. Molecular, microscopic and epidemiological investigations demonstrated the chimpanzees living at Mahale Mountains National Park have been suffering from a respiratory disease that is likely caused by a variant of a human paramyxovirus.

==Conservation==
The US Fish and Wildlife Service finalized a rule on June 12, 2015, creating very strict regulations, practically barring any activity with chimpanzees other than for scientific, preservation-oriented purposes.

<text>Toad of Toad Hall is a play written by A. A. Milne – the first of several dramatisations of Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s 1908 novel &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; – with incidental music by Harold Fraser-Simson. It was originally produced by William Armstrong at the Playhouse Theatre, Liverpool, on 21 December 1929. It was given in the West End the following year, and has been revived frequently by many theatrical companies.

== Background and first productions==
For his stage version of Grahame&#x27;s book, the humorist and playwright A. A. Milne concentrated on the adventures of Mr Toad, which make up about half of the original book, because they lent themselves most easily to being staged. He loved Grahame&#x27;s book, which was one of the reasons why he decided to adapt it. He wrote in the introduction to the published play:
The first production was at the Playhouse Theatre, Liverpool, on 21 December 1929, under the direction of William Armstrong. The first London productions were at the Lyric Theatre on 17 December 1930 and the Savoy Theatre on 22 December 1931, directed by Frank Cellier.

===Original casts===

:Sources: &quot;The Stage&quot; (1929); &quot;The Era&quot; (1930); and playscript (1931).

==Synopsis==
The play comprises a prologue, four acts and an epilogue:

*Prologue and Act 1
:*Down by the Willows
:::The play is framed by scenes featuring two characters not in Grahame&#x27;s book: a 12-year-old girl, Marigold, and her nurse, sitting near a river. Marigold tells her nurse about the riverbank animals, and the scene fades into the main action. Marigold and the nurse are not seen again until the epilogue of the play. Mole emerges from his underground home, and meets Rat and Badger for the first time. They are joined by Toad, who persuades Mole and Rat to join him on a holiday in his new horse-drawn caravan, pulled by the querulous horse Alfred. Unseen, the weasels, ferrets and stoats curse Toad, whom they hate. The caravan is in collision with a motor-car, and Toad becomes instantly obsessed with becoming a motorist. Mole and Rat lead him homewards.
*Act II
::1. The Wild Wood
:::In deep snow, Toad, who has once again crashed his car (his eighth), walks fearfully through the wood, harried by the weasels and their allies. When he has gone, Mole stumbles on, lost, and is rescued by Rat, who has been looking for him. They find themselves at the entrance to Badger&#x27;s house and ring the bell.
::2. Badger&#x27;s House
:::Safely inside Badger&#x27;s underground house, Mole and Rat refresh themselves, and discuss with Badger the excesses Toad has been committing, squandering his fortune on expensive cars and crashing them. Toad now finds Badger&#x27;s house, and seeks refuge. Badger lectures him about his foolish ways, but Toad is unrepentant. Badger says that Toad must stay with him until his motor-mania has worn off, and Toad is locked into the guest-bedroom.
::3. The Same. Some Weeks Later
:::In the absence of Badger and Mole, Toad tricks Rat into letting him escape from his confinement at Badger&#x27;s house and he flees, singing a gleeful and boastful song to himself.
*Act III
::1. The Court-House
:::Toad is on trial for stealing a motor-car, driving recklessly, and, most seriously, being grossly impertinent to a police officer. He is found guilty and sentenced to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment.
::2. The Dungeon
:::Phoebe, the jailer&#x27;s daughter, takes pity on Toad, and helps him escape by disguising him as a washerwoman.
::3. The Canal Bank
:::Toad shakes off the pursuing forces of law and order, and hitches a ride on a canal barge. He quarrels with the barge-woman, steals her horse and rides off.
*Act IV
::1. Rat&#x27;s House By The River
:::Toad makes his way to Rat&#x27;s house, where he learns to his horror that his grand residence, Toad Hall, has been occupied by the weasels, ferrets and stoats. When Mole and Badger enter, the four discuss how to drive the occupiers out.
::2. The Underground Passage
:::In a secret underground passage the four friends prepare to enter Toad Hall and catch the occupiers unawares.
::3. The Banqueting-Room at Toad Hall
:::The Chief Weasel&#x27;s birthday party is in progress. Badger leads the attack and the enemy is quickly routed. Toad sings a song about his homecoming and gradually the other characters of the play – including the weasels, Mole, Rat, the judge, Alfred, the barge-woman, Phoebe, and last of all Badger – join in dancing in a circle round the triumphant Toad.
*Epilogue
::The Wind in the Willows
:::The scene at Toad Hall fades away and the setting is as it was for the prologue. Marigold is asleep; a badger, a water-rat, a mole and finally a toad pass the slumbering child, before the nurse tells her it is time to wake up and come home.

==Music ==
Although not a musical, the play contains ten musical numbers composed by Harold Fraser-Simson:
:1. &quot;Down by the willows&quot; (introductory music)
:2. Thunderstorm, war-song, dance and chorus, &quot;Toad, Toad, down with Toad!&quot;
:3. Mole&#x27;s song, &quot;&#x27;I have noticed before&#x27;, said the wise Mr Rat&quot;
:4. Carol-singers&#x27; chorus, &quot;Joy shall be yours in the morning&quot;
:5. Rat&#x27;s song, &quot;Duck&#x27;s Ditty&quot;

:6. Toad&#x27;s first song, &quot;The World has held great heroes&quot;
:7. The Judge&#x27;s song, &quot;If an animal errs or a citizen sins&quot;
:8. Quartet, &quot;When night comes on and the owls are hooting
:9. Weasel&#x27;s song: &quot;Toad he went a-pleasuring gaily down the road&quot;
:10. Toad&#x27;s second song, &quot;The Toad came home&quot;.
==Critical response==
Reviewing the Liverpool premiere, &quot;The Stage&quot; commented that Milne had succeeded brilliantly in putting Grahame&#x27;s characters on the stage, but thought the play might be over the heads of a children&#x27;s audience, having &quot;so much in it to appeal to the adult mind&quot;. The other principal theatrical paper, &quot;The Era&quot;, thought that there might be &quot;a certain amount of doubt whether Mr Milne has succeeded in bringing the peculiar and indefinable atmosphere of Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s little classic in the realms of fantasy, &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, on to the stage. But perhaps he never attempted to do so. What he has actually done has been to provide an entertainment brimful of delight, for childish hearts&quot;.

==Revivals==
The play was revived in the West End each year from 1932 to 1935, and was next seen there in 1954, in a production first seen at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, with Leo McKern as Toad, William Squire as Rat, Edward Atienza as Mole and Brewster Mason as Badger.

In the 1960s and 1970s there were annual West End revivals during the Christmas season, with Goolden returning to the part of Mole in every year except one. Among the actors appearing in the play in London and elsewhere were, in the title role Michael Bates, Hywel Bennett, Derek Godfrey, Nicky Henson, Michael Hordern, Paul Scofield, Ian Wallace, Michael Williams, Peter Woodthorpe and Patrick Wymark. Alan Badel and Clive Revill were among those seen as Rat; Badgers included Michael Blakemore, Mark Dignam, John Justin and John Woodvine. Performers seen in other roles in the play included Beverley Cross, Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Rita Tushingham and Brett Usher.
In the 1980s and subsequently the play has been frequently revived in London, the British provinces and in North America.

== Adaptations ==
The BBC has broadcast several adaptations of the play. A 1942 radio version featured Goolden and Burtwell reprising their roles from the first London production, Fred Yule was Badger and Vernon Harris was Rat. Michael Barry&#x27;s television version of the play was broadcast live on eight occasions between 1946 and 1950 with varying casts, the only principal common to all eight being Kenneth More as Badger. A 1953 television version featured Gerald Campion as Toad and Patrick Troughton as Badger.

A serialised radio adaptation of the play was broadcast on &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; in 1948; Norman Shelley played Toad, Goolden was Mole and Leslie French Rat. A 1973 radio version featured Goolden with Derek Smith as Toad, Bernard Cribbins as Rat, Cyril Luckham as Badger and Hugh Paddick as the Judge. This version was broadcast again in 1973, 1976, 1979, 1981 and 1990.

<text>Boraginaceae, the [[Boraginaceae|borage]] or [[forget-me-not]] family, includes about 2,000 species of shrubs, trees, and herbs in 146 to 154 genera with a worldwide distribution.

The APG IV system from 2016 classifies the Boraginaceae as single family of the order Boraginales within the asterids. Under the older Cronquist system, it was included in the Lamiales, but clearly is no more similar to the other families in this order than it is to families in several other asterid orders. A revision of the Boraginales, also from 2016, split the Boraginaceae into 11 distinct families: Boraginaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, Codonaceae, Coldeniaceae, Cordiaceae, Ehretiaceae, Heliotropiaceae, Hoplestigmataceae, Hydrophyllaceae, Lennoaceae, Namaceae, and Wellstediaceae.

These plants have alternately arranged leaves, or a combination of alternate and opposite leaves. The leaf blades usually have a narrow shape; many are linear or lance-shaped. They are smooth-edged or toothed, and some have petioles. Most species have bisexual flowers, but some taxa are dioecious. Most pollination is by hymenopterans, such as bees. Most species have inflorescences that have a coiling shape, at least when new, called scorpioid cymes. The flower has a usually five-lobed calyx. The corolla varies in shape from rotate to bell-shaped to tubular, but it generally has five lobes. It can be green, white, yellow, orange, pink, purple, or blue. There are five stamens and one style with one or two stigmas. The fruit is a drupe, sometimes fleshy.

Most members of this family have hairy leaves. The coarse character of the hairs is due to cystoliths of silicon dioxide and calcium carbonate. These hairs can induce an adverse skin reaction, including itching and rash in some individuals, particularly among people who handle the plants regularly, such as gardeners. In some species, anthocyanins cause the flowers to change color from red to blue with age. This may be a signal to pollinators that a flower is old and depleted of pollen and nectar.

Well-known members of the family include:
* alkanet (&quot;Alkanna tinctoria&quot;)
* borage (&quot;Borago officinalis&quot;)
* comfrey (&quot;Symphytum&quot; spp.)
* fiddleneck (&quot;Amsinckia&quot; spp.)
* forget-me-not (&quot;Myosotis&quot; spp.)
* geigertree (&quot;Cordia sebestena&quot;)
* green alkanet (&quot;Pentaglottis sempervirens&quot;)
* heliotrope (&quot;Heliotropium&quot; spp.)
* hound&#x27;s tongue (&quot;Cynoglossum&quot; spp.)
* lungwort (&quot;Pulmonaria&quot; spp.)
* oysterplant (&quot;Mertensia maritima&quot;)
* purple viper&#x27;s bugloss/Salvation Jane (&quot;Echium plantagineum&quot;)
* Siberian bugloss (&quot;Brunnera macrophylla&quot;)
* viper&#x27;s bugloss (&quot;Echium vulgare&quot;)

<text>Symphytum is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae, known by the common name comfrey (pronounced , from the Latin confervere to &#x27;heal&#x27; or literally to &#x27;boil together&#x27;, referring to uses in ancient traditional medicine).

&quot;Symphytum&quot; is native to northern temperate regions of Asia and North America, with a wide introduced distribution on both continents. There are 59 recognized species. Some species and hybrids, particularly &quot;S. officinale&quot;, &quot;Symphytum grandiflorum&quot;, and &quot;S.&quot; × &quot;uplandicum&quot;, are used in gardening and herbal medicine. Species in the genus &quot;Symphytum&quot; are different from &quot;Andersonglossum virginianum&quot;, known as wild comfrey, which is another member of the borage family.

*&quot;Symphytum × wettsteinii&quot; 

==Cultivation==
The Russian comfrey &#x27;Bocking 14&#x27; cultivar was developed during the 1950s by Lawrence D. Hills, the founder of the Henry Doubleday Research Association (the organic gardening organization itself named after Henry Doubleday, who first introduced Russian comfrey into Britain in the nineteenth century) following trials at Bocking, Essex.

===Propagation===
Bocking 14 is sterile, and therefore will not set seed (one of its advantages over other cultivars as it will not spread out of control); thus, it is propagated from root cuttings. The gardener can produce &quot;offsets&quot; from mature, strongly growing plants by driving a spade horizontally through the leaf clumps about below the soil surface. This removes the crown, which can then be split into pieces. The original plant will quickly recover, and each piece can be replanted with the growing points just below the soil surface, and will quickly grow into new plants. Offsets can also be purchased by mail order from specialist nurseries in order to initially build up a stock of plants.

==Phytochemistry, folk medicine, and toxicity==
Folk medicine names for comfrey include knitbone, boneset, and the derivation of its Latin name &quot;Symphytum&quot; (from the Greek &quot;symphis&quot;, meaning growing together of bones, and &quot;phyton&quot;, a plant), referring to its ancient uses. Similarly, the common French name is , meaning to weld together. The tradition in different cultures and languages suggest a common belief in its usefulness for mending bones.

Comfrey contains mixed phytochemicals in varying amounts, including allantoin, mucilage, saponins, tannins, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and inulin, among others. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are responsible for comfrey&#x27;s liver toxicity, which is associated with consuming this plant or its extracts. In modern herbalism, comfrey is most commonly used topically.

In 2001, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a ban of comfrey products marketed for internal use, and a warning label for those intended for external use. Use of comfrey is particularly discouraged during pregnancy and lactation, in infants, and in people with liver, kidney, or vascular diseases.

<text>A strophe () is a poetic term originally referring to the first part of the ode in Ancient Greek tragedy, followed by the antistrophe and epode. The term has been extended to also mean a structural division of a poem containing stanzas of varying line length. Strophic poetry is to be contrasted with poems composed line-by-line non-stanzaically, such as Greek epic poems or English blank verse, to which the term &quot;stichic&quot; applies.

In its original Greek setting, &quot;strophe, antistrophe and epode were a kind of stanza framed only for the music&quot;, as John Milton wrote in the preface to &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;, with the strophe chanted by a Greek chorus as it moved from right to left across the scene.

==Etymology==
Strophe (from Greek , &quot;turn, bend, twist&quot;) is a concept in versification which properly means a turn, as from one foot to another, or from one side of a chorus to the other.

==Poetic structure==
In a more general sense, the strophe is a pair of stanzas of alternating form on which the structure of a given poem is based, with the strophe usually being identical to the stanza in modern poetry and its arrangement and recurrence of rhymes giving it its character. But the Greeks called a combination of verse-periods a system, giving the name &quot;strophe&quot; to such a system only when it was repeated once or more in unmoved form.

A simple form of Greek strophe is the Sapphic strophe. Like all Greek verse, it is composed of alternating long and short syllables (symbolized by — for long, u for short and x for either long or short) in this case arranged in the following manner:

— u — x — u u — u — —

— u — x — u u — u — —

— u — x — u u — u — x — u u — —

Far more complex forms are found in the odes of Pindar and the choral sections of Greek drama.

In choral poetry, it is common to find the strophe followed by a metrically identical antistrophe, which may – in Pindar and other epinician poets – be followed in turn by a metrically dissimilar epode, creating an &quot;AAB&quot; form.

==Origins and development==
It is said that Archilochus first created the strophe by binding together systems of two or three lines. But it was the Greek ode-writers who introduced the practice of strophe-writing on a large scale, and the art was attributed to Stesichorus, although it is likely that earlier poets were acquainted with it. The arrangement of an ode in a splendid and consistent artifice of strophe, antistrophe and epode was carried to its height by Pindar.

==Variant forms==
With the development of Greek prosody, various peculiar strophe-forms came into general acceptance, and were made celebrated by the frequency with which leading poets employed them. Among these were the &quot;Sapphic,&quot; the &quot;Elegiac,&quot; the &quot;Alcaic,&quot; and the &quot;Asclepiadean&quot; strophe, all of them prominent in Greek and Latin verse. The briefest and the most ancient strophe is the &quot;dactylic distich,&quot; which consists of two verses of the same class of rhythm, the second producing a melodic counterpart to the first.

==Reproductions==
The forms in modern English verse which reproduce most exactly the impression aimed at by the ancient ode strophe are the elaborate rhymed stanzas of such poems as Keats&#x27; &quot;&quot; or Matthew Arnold&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

A strophic form of poetry called Muwashshah developed in Andalucia as early as the 9th century CE, which then spread to North Africa and the Middle East. Muwashshah was typically in classical Arabic, with the refrain sometimes in the local dialect.

==Contemporary usage==
The term strophe is used in modern and post-modern criticism to indicate &quot;long non-isomorphic units&quot; of verse whereas the term &quot;stanza [is used] for more regular ones&quot;.

<text>According to one meaning of the word, an epode is the third part of an ancient Greek choral ode that follows the strophe and the antistrophe and completes the movement.

The word epode is also used to refer to the second (shorter) line of a two-line stanza of the kind composed by Archilochus and Hipponax in which the first line consists of a dactylic hexameter or an iambic trimeter. (See Archilochian.) It can also be used (as in Horace&#x27;s Epodes), to refer to poems written in such stanzas.

In the performance of a choral ode, at a certain point in time the choirs, which had previously chanted to the right of the altar or stage, and then to the left of it, combined and sang in unison, or permitted the &quot;coryphaeus&quot; to sing for them all, while standing in the centre.

The epode soon took its place in choral poetry, which it lost when that branch of literature declined. But it extended beyond the ode, and in the early dramatists we find numerous examples of monologues and dialogues framed on the epodical system. In Latin poetry the epode was cultivated, in conscious archaism, both as a part of the ode and as an independent branch of poetry. Of the former class, the epithalamia of Catullus, founded on an imitation of Pindar, present us with examples of strophe, antistrophe and epode; and it has been observed that the celebrated ode 1.12 of Horace, beginning , possesses this triple character.

==&quot;Epodes&quot; of Horace==
The word is now mainly familiar from the or the &quot;Book of Epodes&quot;, one of the early works of Horace. He says in the course of these poems that in composing them he was introducing a new form, at least in Latin literature, and that he was imitating the effect of the iambic distichs invented by Archilochus. Accordingly, the first ten of these epodes are composed in alternate verses of iambic trimeter and iambic dimeter, as at, for example, &quot;Epode&quot; 5.1–2:

:&#x27;But, o any of the gods in the heavens ruling&lt;br&gt;      the lands and the human race.&#x27;

In the seven remaining epodes Horace diversified the measures, while retaining the general character of the distich. This group of poems belongs mostly to the early youth of the poet and displays a truculence and a controversial heat which are absent from his more mature writings. As he was imitating Archilochus in form, he believed himself justified in repeating the sarcastic violence of his fierce model. These particular poems of Horace, which are short lyrical satires, have appropriated almost exclusively the name of epodes, although they bear little enough resemblance to the epode of early Greek literature.

<text>Antistrophe (, &quot;a turning back&quot;) is the portion of an ode sung by the chorus in its returning movement from west to east in response to the strophe, which was sung from east to west.

== Characteristics ==

=== Usage as a literary device ===
It has the nature of a reply and balances the effect of the strophe. Thus, in Gray&#x27;s ode called &quot;The Progress of Poesy&quot; (excerpt below), the strophe, which dwelt in triumphant accents on the beauty, power and ecstasy verse, is answered by the antistrophe, in a depressed and melancholy key:
When the sections of the chorus have ended their responses, they unite and close in the epode, thus exemplifying the triple form, in which the ancient sacred hymns of Greece were coined, from the days of Stesichorus onwards. As Milton says: &quot;strophe, antistrophe and epode were a kind of stanza framed for the music then used with the chorus that sang&quot;.

=== Other semantic usage ===
&quot;Antistrophe&quot; was also a kind of ancient dance, wherein dancers stepped sometimes to the right, and sometimes to the left, still doubling their turns or conversions. The motion toward the left, they called &quot;antistrophe&quot;, from &quot;ἀντί&quot;, &quot;against&quot;, and &quot;στροφή&quot;, of &quot;στρέφω&quot;, &quot;I turn&quot;.

<doc id="78910" wikidata="Q216870" url="?curid=78910" title="Samuel Barber">
<text>Samuel Osmond Barber II (March 9, 1910 – January 23, 1981) was an American composer, pianist, conductor, baritone, and music educator, and one of the most celebrated composers of the mid-20th century. Principally influenced by nine years&#x27; composition studies with Rosario Scalero at the Curtis Institute and more than 25 years&#x27; study with his uncle, the composer Sidney Homer, Barber&#x27;s music usually eschewed the experimental trends of musical modernism in favor of traditional 19th-century harmonic language and formal structure embracing lyricism and emotional expression. However, he adopted elements of modernism after 1940 in some of his compositions, such as an increased use of dissonance and chromaticism in the &quot;Cello Concerto&quot; (1945) and &quot;Medea&#x27;s Dance of Vengeance&quot; (1955); and the use of tonal ambiguity and a narrow use of serialism in his &quot;Piano Sonata&quot; (1949), &quot;Prayers of Kierkegaard&quot; (1954), and &quot;Nocturne&quot; (1959).

Barber was adept at both instrumental and vocal music. His works became successful on the international stage and many of his compositions enjoyed rapid adoption into the classical performance canon. In particular, his &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; (1936) has earned a permanent place in the orchestral concert repertory, as has that work&#x27;s adaptation for chorus, &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; (1967). He received the Pulitzer Prize for Music twice: for his opera &quot;Vanessa&quot; (1956–1957), and for the &quot;Concerto for Piano and Orchestra&quot; (1962). Also widely performed is his &quot;&quot; (1947), a setting for soprano and orchestra of a prose text by James Agee. At the time of Barber&#x27;s death, nearly all of his compositions had been recorded. Many of his compositions were commissioned or first performed by such noted groups and artists as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera, Vladimir Horowitz, Eleanor Steber, Raya Garbousova, John Browning, Leontyne Price, Pierre Bernac, Francis Poulenc, and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.

While Barber composed a significant body of purely instrumental music, two-thirds of his compositional output was art songs for voice and piano, choral music, and songs for voice and orchestra. Some of his most frequently performed songs include both the solo voice and choral versions of &quot;Sure on this shining night&quot; (solo version from 1938 and choral version from 1961) with text by Agee; and the song cycle &quot;Hermit Songs&quot; (1953), with anonymous texts by Irish monks from the eighth through thirteenth centuries. This emphasis on sung material was rooted in his own brief career as a professional baritone in his 20s which inspired a lifelong love of vocal music. In 1935, Barber recorded his own setting of Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Dover Beach&quot; for NBC, singing the vocal part accompanied by string quartet, and he was also featured weekly on NBC Radio in 1935–1936 performing German lieder and art songs. He also occasionally conducted performances and recordings of his works with symphony orchestras during the 1950s, and taught composition at the Curtis Institute from 1939 to 1942.

Barber was in a relationship with the composer Gian Carlo Menotti for more than 40 years. They lived at Capricorn, a house just north of New York City, where they frequently hosted parties with academic and music luminaries. Menotti was Barber&#x27;s librettist for two of his three operas. When the relationship ended in 1970, they remained close friends until Barber&#x27;s death from cancer in 1981.

==Biography==
===Childhood (1910–1923)===
Barber was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, the son of Marguerite McLeod (née Beatty) and Samuel Le Roy Barber. He was born into a comfortable, educated, social, and distinguished American family. His father was a physician; his mother was a pianist of English-Scottish-Irish descent whose family had lived in the United States since the time of the American Revolutionary War. His maternal aunt, Louise Homer, was a leading contralto at the Metropolitan Opera; his uncle, Sidney Homer, was a composer of American art songs. Louise Homer is known to have influenced Barber&#x27;s interest in voice. Through his aunt, Barber was introduced to many great singers and songs. Sidney Homer mentored Barber for more than 25 years, and profoundly influenced his compositional aesthetics.

A child prodigy, Barber became profoundly interested in music at a very young age, and it was apparent that he had great musical talent and ability. He began studying the piano at the age of six and at age seven composed his first work, &quot;Sadness&quot;, a 23-measure solo piano piece in C minor. Despite Barber&#x27;s interest in music, his family wanted him to become a typical extroverted, athletic American boy. This meant, in particular, they encouraged his playing football. However, Barber was in no way a typical boy, and at the age of nine he wrote to his mother:

At the age of 10, Barber wrote his first operetta, &quot;The Rose Tree&quot;, to a libretto by the family&#x27;s cook. At the age of 12, he became an organist at a local church.

===Education and early career (1924–1941)===
As a young boy, Barber took private lessons from William Hatton Green. Constant Vauclain, one of Barber&#x27;s peers, described Green being one of Barber&#x27;s greatest early influences. At the age of 14, Barber entered the youth artist program at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he ultimately spent ten years developing his talents as a triple prodigy in composition, voice, and piano. During his initial studies at Curtis, he simultaneously attended and graduated from West Chester High School (later West Chester Henderson High School), during which time he composed his school&#x27;s alma mater which is still in use. Following his graduation from high school in 1928, he entered the adult professional program at Curtis from which he graduated in 1934. At Curtis he studied piano with George Frederick Boyle and Isabelle Vengerova, composition with Rosario Scalero, conducting with Fritz Reiner, and voice with Emilio de Gogorza. In 1928, he met fellow Curtis schoolmate Gian Carlo Menotti, who became his partner in life as well as in their shared profession. During his last year at Curtis he became a favorite of the conservatory&#x27;s founder, Mary Louise Curtis Bok. It was through Mrs. Bok that Barber was introduced to his lifelong publishers, the Schirmer family.

From his early adulthood, Barber wrote a flurry of successful compositions, launching him into the spotlight of the classical music world. According to Walter Simmons, Barber&#x27;s earlier compositions contain certain characteristics that directly relate to the &quot;childhood&quot; period of his composition, extending to 1942. The use of tonal harmony, unresolved dissonance, moderate chromaticism, and largely diatonic, lyrical melodies are some of the defining features of this period in his compositional career. At the age of 18, he won the Joseph H. Bearns Prize from Columbia University for his violin sonata (since lost or destroyed by the composer). He won the Bearns Prize a second time for his first large-scale orchestral work, an overture to &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, which was composed in 1931 when he was 21 years old. It premiered successfully two years later in a performance given by the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of conductor Alexander Smallens.

While a student at Curtis, Barber also pursued other music development opportunities as well as personal interests through travels in Europe; mainly in the summer months when school was not in session but also sometimes for longer periods. His first European trip began in the summer of 1928 in which he visited Paris, Brittany, and Italy with cellist and composer David Freed. He continued to travel in Europe in the fall of 1928 without Freed to other European cities in Czechoslovakia, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria; during which time he first visited the city of Vienna which would later become an important city in his musical development. During this first stay in Vienna in 1928 he formed a friendship with composer George Antheil.

Barber returned to Italy in the summer of 1929 using funds he received upon winning the Bearns Prize; this time with Menotti as his travel companion. He returned to Paris in the summer of 1930, and in the summers of 1931 and 1933 both Barber and Menotti studied composition with Rosario Scalero in Montestrutto, Turin while staying with Menotti&#x27;s parents in Cadegliano. After winning the Bearns Prize a second time in April 1933, he extended his stay in Europe beyond the summer of that year to pursue further studies in Vienna; staying in that city in the Autumn of 1933 into the early part of 1934. During this period his studies were mainly focused on developing his talents as a vocalist with the intent of pursuing a career as a baritone. He also studied conducting independently during this period; making his professional conducting debut in Vienna on January 4, 1934. In March 1934 he returned to Philadelphia to finish his studies at Curtis.

After graduating from Curtis in the spring of 1934, Barber pursued further studies in conducting and singing with John Braun in Vienna in the summers of 1935 and 1936 through the aid of a Pulitzer traveling scholarship. He soon after was awarded the Rome Prize which enabled him to pursue further studies at the American Academy in Rome from 1935 to 1937. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1946 and also studied conducting privately with George Szell.

In his early career Barber had a brief career as a professional baritone, performing on the NBC Music Guild concert series and earning a weekly contract on NBC radio in 1935. Musicologist Barbara Heyman wrote that Barber&#x27;s recording of his own setting of Arnold&#x27;s Dover Beach was hailed as having &quot;singular charm and beauty, intelligently sung by a naturally beautiful voice&quot;. First-hand experience as a singer and an intuitive empathy with the voice would find expression in the large legacy of songs that occupy some two-thirds of his output.

Barber&#x27;s first orchestral work to receive international attention was his &quot;Symphony in One Movement&quot; which he wrote while studying composition in Rome. The work was premiered by the Orchestra dell&#x27;Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome under the baton of Bernardino Molinari in December 1936, and was soon after programmed by symphony orchestras in New York City and Cleveland. The work was the first symphonic composition created by an American to appear at the Salzburg Festival, where it was performed in 1937.

In 1938, when Barber was 28, his &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; was performed by the NBC Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Arturo Toscanini, along with his first &quot;Essay for Orchestra&quot;. The Adagio had been arranged from the slow movement of Barber&#x27;s String Quartet, Op. 11. Toscanini had rarely performed music by American composers before (an exception was Howard Hanson&#x27;s Symphony No. 2, which he conducted in 1933). At the end of the first rehearsal of the piece, Toscanini remarked, &quot;Semplice e bella&quot; (simple and beautiful). From 1939 to 1942, Barber taught composition at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.

During this time, there was a major turning point in Barber&#x27;s music. In 1940, he wrote a choral piece using Stephen Spender&#x27;s war poem, &quot;A Stopwatch and an Ordnance Map&quot;. From this point forward, World War II caused his second phase of composing. This new phase was greatly influenced by other composers such as Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Bartók, and genres such as jazz. His new era of composition would feature a greater involvement in American literature and culture.

===Mid career (1942–1966)===
In 1942, after the US entered World War II, Barber joined the Army Air Corps where he remained in service through 1945. Barber&#x27;s first work after his military induction was the &quot;Commando March&quot; (1943), which was his only work for a concert band. It was premièred by the Army Air Forces Technical Training Command Band in Atlantic City on May 23, 1943. Sergei Koussevitzky commissioned an orchestral version for performance by the Boston Symphony that same year.

While in the Army Air Corps Barber was commissioned to write other several works for the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO), including his &quot;Cello Concerto&quot; for Raya Garbousova and his &quot;Second Symphony&quot;, a work he later suppressed. Composed in 1943, the symphony was originally titled &quot;Symphony Dedicated to the Air Forces&quot; and was premiered in early 1944 by Serge Koussevitzky and the BSO. Barber revised the symphony in 1947 and it was subsequently published by G. Schirmer in 1950 and recorded the following year by the New Symphony Orchestra of London, conducted by Barber himself. According to some sources, Barber destroyed the score in 1964. Hans Heinsheimer was an eyewitness, and reported that he accompanied Barber to the publisher&#x27;s office where they collected all the music from the library, and Barber &quot;tore up all these beautifully and expensively copied materials with his own hands&quot;. Doubt has been cast on this story, however, on grounds that Heinsheimer, as an executive at G. Schirmer, would have been unlikely to have allowed Barber into the Schirmer offices to watch him rip apart the music that his company had invested money in publishing. The score was later reconstructed from the instrumental parts, and released in a Vox Box &quot;Stradivari Classics&quot; recording by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra conducted by Andrew Schenck in 1988.

In 1943, Barber and Menotti purchased &#x27;Capricorn&#x27;, a house north of Manhattan in suburban Mount Kisco, New York. The home served as their artistic retreat up until 1972, and it was at this house that Barber had his most productive years as a composer during the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s. Here he wrote ballet suite &quot;Medea&quot; (1946) for Martha Graham and the symphonic work &quot;&quot; for soprano and orchestra for opera singer Eleanor Steber who premiered the work with the BSO in 1948. In 1946 he was selected by the United States Department of State to be a member of the American delegation to the first Prague Spring International Music Festival where his music was showcased alongside other prominent American composers such as Leonard Bernstein. In 1949 he achieved a major critical success with his &quot;Piano Sonata&quot; which was premiered by Vladimir Horowitz and commissioned by Irving Berlin and Richard Rodgers to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the League of Composers. Popularized in concerts internationally by Horowitz and other prominent pianists, the work earned an enduring place in the performance canon.

In the 1950s Barber was engaged to conduct his own works with several symphony orchestras internationally for performances and recordings, including the BSO, the Berlin Philharmonic and the Frankfurt Radio Symphony. To prepare for recordings of his &quot;Second Symphony&quot;, &quot;Cello Concerto&quot; and the &quot;Medea&quot; ballet suite, he studied conducting with Nikolai Malko in 1951. In 1952 he was elected vice president of the International Music Council. In 1953 Barber was introduced to soprano Leontyne Price by her voice teacher Florence Kimball, who was a friend of Barber, when he approached Kimball about needing a singer to perform his song cycle &quot;Hermit Songs&quot;. Impressed with her voice, Barber engaged her to premiere the work at the Library of Congress with Barber accompanying on the piano. Price also sang for the premiere of Barber&#x27;s cantata &quot;Prayers of Kierkegaard&quot; with the BSO in 1954, and would become closely associated with performances of his music over the next two decades.

In 1958 Barber won the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his first opera &quot;Vanessa&quot; which premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in January 1958 with a cast that included opera stars Eleanor Steber, Rosalind Elias, Regina Resnik, Nicolai Gedda, and Giorgio Tozzi. The Met took the production to the Salzburg Festival later that year, becoming the first American opera to be performed at that festival. Menotti wrote the libretto for both &quot;Vanessa&quot;, and Barber&#x27;s second opera &quot;A Hand of Bridge&quot;. This latter work premiered at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy in 1959 with a cast that included Patricia Neway and William Lewis.

In 1962 Barber became the first American composer to attend the biennial Congress of Soviet Composers in Moscow. That same year he won the Pulitzer Prize a second time for his &quot;Piano Concerto&quot; which was one of three works by him commissioned for the opening of Lincoln Center and was performed at the opening of Philharmonic Hall with pianist John Browning in September 1962. The second work performed for the opening of Lincoln Center was his &quot;Andromache&#x27;s Farewell&quot;, a piece for soprano and orchestra, which was premiered by the New York Philharmonic and soprano Martina Arroyo with Thomas Schippers conducting in April 1963. The final composition composed for Lincoln center was his third and final opera, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, which premiered at the opening of the new Metropolitan Opera House in 1966 with Leontyne Price and Justino Diaz in the title roles. Barber worked on the opera in Greece and was visited by writer William Goyen&#x27;s former lover, American artist Joseph Glasco and his collector-friend Stanley Seeger. This visit may have proved to be a distraction and the work was poorly received by critics, although Barber himself believed it contained some of his best work, and he spent the decade following its premiere revising the opera.

===Later years (1966–1981)===

After the harsh rejection of his third opera &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1966), Barber battled depression and alcoholism which had a negative impact on his creative productivity. He began to divide his time between his home in New York and a chalet in Santa Cristina, Italy, where he spent long periods in isolation. Tensions grew between Menotti and Barber, leading Menotti to insist that the couple end their romantic attachment and put &#x27;Capricorn&#x27; up for sale in 1970. Capricorn sold in 1972, and the two men remained friends after their romantic involvement ended.
During his troubled later years, Barber continued to write music until he was almost 70 years old. In 1967 he successfully adapted his &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; (1936) to a choral work, &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;, set to the Latin liturgical mass text on the Lamb of God. The work has become widely performed and recorded by choirs internationally. In 1969 Leontyne Price performed the premiere of Barber&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Despite and Still&quot; which emphasized textual themes of loneliness, isolation, and lost love; all issues present in Barber&#x27;s own personal life at the time of this work&#x27;s creation. This work adopted a more modern dissonant harmonic language with vivid textual imagery characterized by tonal ambiguity and a frequent use of chromaticism, conflicting triads, tritones, and whole-tone segments. In 1971 his cantata &quot;The Lovers&quot; was well received by audiences and critics when it premiered in performances with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Finnish baritone Tom Krause, and the Temple University Chorus directed by Robert Page. The &quot;Third Essay for Orchestra&quot; (1978) was his last major work.

Barber was hospitalized on and off between 1978 and 1981 while undergoing treatment for cancer. He died of the disease on January 23, 1981, at his 907 Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan at the age of 70. The funeral was held at the First Presbyterian Church of West Chester three days later and he was buried in the Oaklands Cemetery there. His final composition, &quot;Canzone for oboe and string orchestra&quot; (1981), was published after his death. Initially intended to be a fully developed oboe concerto, Barber only completed the second movement of that work.

==Achievements and awards==
At the time of Barber&#x27;s death in 1981, Pulitzer Prize winning music critic Donal Henahan wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about Barber that &quot;probably no other American composer has ever enjoyed such early, such persistent and such long-lasting acclaim&quot;.

Barber received numerous awards and prizes, including the Rome Prize, two Pulitzer Prizes, the Henry Hadley Medal (1958), and the Gold Medal for Music at the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters (1976). He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and, as a Fellow, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1961.

Barber was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal in 1980 by the MacDowell Colony for outstanding contribution to the arts. In 1998, the American Classical Music Hall of Fame inducted Barber posthumously.

In addition to composing, Barber was active in organizations that sought to help musicians and promote music. He was president of the International Music Council of UNESCO. He worked to bring attention to and ameliorate adverse conditions facing musicians and musical organizations worldwide. He was one of the first American composers to visit Russia (then part of the Soviet Union). Barber was also influential in the successful campaign by composers against ASCAP, the goal of which was to increase royalties paid to composers.

==Music==

===Orchestral===
Through the success of his Overture to &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1931), &quot;Music for a Scene from Shelley&quot; (1933), &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; (1936), (First) &quot;Symphony in One Movement&quot; (1936), (First) &quot;Essay for Orchestra&quot; (1937) and Violin Concerto (1939), Barber garnered performances by the world&#x27;s leading conductors such as Artur Rodziński, Eugene Ormandy, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Bruno Walter, Charles Münch, George Szell, Leopold Stokowski, and Thomas Schippers.

Among his works are four concertos, one each for violin (1939), cello (1945) and piano (1962), and the neoclassical &quot;Capricorn Concerto&quot; for flute, oboe, trumpet and string orchestra (1944). He also wrote a concertante work for organ and orchestra entitled &quot;Toccata Festiva&quot; (1960).

Barber&#x27;s final opus was the &quot;Canzonetta&quot; for oboe and string orchestra (1977–78), Op. 48, originally intended as the second movement of an oboe concerto.

===Piano===
Barber&#x27;s most important and most played works for the piano include his &quot;Excursions&quot;, Op. 20, which emulate four styles of classic American idioms, including the boogie-woogie and blues, and the Piano Sonata in E-flat minor, Op. 26. The &quot;Nocturne (Homage to John Field)&quot;, Op. 33, is another respected piece which he composed for the instrument. In 1977, the Van Cliburn Foundation commissioned Barber to write a &quot;Ballade&quot;, Op. 46, for the fifth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition.

===Opera===
Menotti supplied the libretto for Barber&#x27;s opera &quot;Vanessa&quot;. (Menotti also contributed the libretto for Barber&#x27;s chamber opera &quot;A Hand of Bridge&quot;.) In 1956, using his vocal training, Barber played and sang the score of &quot;Vanessa&quot; for the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s general manager, Rudolf Bing, who accepted the work. It premiered in January 1958. &quot;Vanessa&quot; won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize and gained acclaim as the first American grand opera.

Barber&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; was commissioned for the new Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center, and premiered at the opening of Opera House on September 16, 1966. The elaborate production, designed by Franco Zeffirelli, was plagued with technical disasters; it also overwhelmed and obscured Barber&#x27;s music, which most critics derided as uncharacteristically weak and unoriginal. The critical rejection of music that Barber considered to be among his best sent him into a deep depression. In recent years, a revised version of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, for which Menotti provided collaborative assistance, has enjoyed some success.

===Violin===
In 1939 Philadelphia industrialist Samuel Simeon Fels commissioned Barber to write a violin concerto for Fels&#x27;s ward, Iso Briselli, a 1934 graduate from the Curtis Institute of Music (as Barber was). The Barber biographies written by Nathan Broder (1954) and Barbara B. Heyman (1992) discuss the genesis of the concerto during the period of the violin concerto&#x27;s commission and subsequent year leading up to the first performance. Heyman interviewed Briselli and others familiar with the history for her book. In late 2010, previously unpublished letters written by Fels, Barber, and Albert Meiff (Briselli&#x27;s violin coach in that period), from the Samuel Simeon Fels Papers archived at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, became available to the public.

<text>Fraxinus americana, the white ash or American ash, is a fast-growing species of ash tree native to eastern and central North America.

White ash trees are threatened by the invasive emerald ash borer. The tree is highly valued as lumber.

== Description ==

The name white ash derives from the glaucous undersides of the leaves. It is similar in appearance to the green ash, making identification difficult. The lower sides of the leaves of white ash are lighter in color than their upper sides, and the outer surface of the twigs of white ash may be flaky or peeling. Green ash leaves are similar in color on upper and lower sides, and twigs are smoother. White ash leaves turn yellow or red in autumn. Despite some overlap, the two species tend to grow in different locations as well; white ash is a forest tree that commonly occurs alongside sugar maple while green ash is a pioneer species that inhabits riparian zones and disturbed areas. The white ash&#x27;s compound leaves usually have seven leaflets per leaf whereas the counts in other ash trees more often vary.

Like other species in the section &quot;Melioides&quot;, &quot;Fraxinus americana&quot; is dioecious, with male and female flowers produced on separate individuals.

The C-shaped leaf scars of white ash are useful in distinguishing this species from the closely related green ash (&quot;Fraxinus pennsylvanica&quot;). The lateral buds of &quot;F. pennsylvanica&quot; share a less curved margin with their corresponding leaf scars, imparting an overall D shape to the latter.

==Distribution and habitat==

The species is native to mesophytic hardwood forests from Nova Scotia west to Minnesota, south to northern Florida, and southwest to eastern Texas. Isolated populations have also been found in western Texas, Wyoming, and Colorado, and the species is reportedly naturalized in Hawaii.

There are an estimated 8 billion ash trees in the United States – the majority being white ash trees and green ash trees.

== Ecology ==

=== Emerald ash borer ===
The emerald ash borer (&quot;Agrilus planipennis&quot;), also commonly known by the acronym EAB, is a green beetle native to Asia; its larvae kill ash trees. In North America, the EAB is an invasive species, highly destructive to ash trees in its introduced range. The damage of this insect rivals that of chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease. For perspective, the number of chestnuts killed by the chestnut blight was around 3.5 billion chestnut trees while there are 3.5 billion ash trees in Ohio alone. Dutch elm disease killed only 200 million elm trees while EAB threatens 7.5 billion ash trees in the United States. The insect threatens the entire North American genus &quot;Fraxinus&quot;. Since its introduction into the United States and Canada in the 1990s, and its subsequent detection in Detroit, Michigan, in 2002, it has spread to eleven states and adjacent parts of Canada. It has killed at least 50 million ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the ash trees throughout North America. White ash exhibits a little more resistance to the EAB than green ash, which has nearly no resistance; however this could also possibly be due to white ash not being used in landscaping as extensively or placed in high-stress environments.

An infested tree can be recognized by premature fall color and leaf senescence observed on affected branches between August and last week of September. Before the EAB was officially identified, such dieback symptoms were thought to have been caused by a vascular disease classified as ash yellows. It was assumed damage was caused by the EAB taking advantage of weakened trees. Other recognizable signs regularly observed have been upper crown dieback, epicormic shoots or sprouts, bark lesions, frass filled larval galleries, and deformed exit holes. When the &quot;flatheaded&quot; beetle has fully developed, it will bore out of the tree, in this instance, with a hole in a deformed &quot;D&quot; shape. In the past, it was assumed once any symptoms had started to show, or once a tree had become infested, it was likely too late to begin management. Later it became clear that only on-site professionals diagnosing an individual tree can responsibly make such determinations.

=== Ash fungal disease ===
&quot;Hymenoscyphus fraxineus&quot; is a fungal disease that attacks ash trees. The disease causes leaf loss, crown dieback, and lesions in the bark. This fungus is, for the most part, fatal, both directly and indirectly, by weakening the tree&#x27;s immune system so that it is more susceptible to attacks from pests or pathogens. Because of this, younger trees are more affected, and fully mature ash trees are incapable of living long enough to reproduce. The disease has spread over most of Europe and has been confirmed in Britain, however it has not been found in North America. The scale of the threat is not yet known, but is thought to be able to cause significant damage to the ash landscape of Europe and the UK.

== Cultivation and uses ==
White ash is one of the most used trees for everyday purposes and, to keep up with high demand, is cultivated almost everywhere possible. The wood is white and quite dense (within 20% of 670 kg/m3), strong, and straight-grained. Its species produces an ideal, atypical dominant excurrent structured crown. It is a traditional timber of choice for production of baseball bats and tool handles. The wood is also favorable for furniture and flooring. A study compared it to eight other different species, and it showed the highest antibacterial activity in the context of manufacturing chopping boards.

Woodworkers use the timber mainly for interior uses due to high perishability in contact with ground soil. It is also used to make lobster traps. Since the 1950s, it has also become a popular choice for solid electric guitar bodies. It makes a serviceable longbow if properly worked. The wood was used in ceiling fan blades from the 1970s through the mid-1980s, though cane was sometimes simulated with plastic then. It is no longer used for ceiling fan blades in most countries.

White ash is not seen in cultivation as often as green ash, due to its preference for undisturbed forest sites away from urban pollution and soil compaction. It sometimes has been planted for its consistently reliable autumn colors, which typically are bright orange and red hues as opposed to other species of ash that produce a uniform yellow color.

Cultivation of white ash differs across North American continent. For example, within the City of Chicago region, 2010 statistics show most common street tree species is white ash at 6.2%. Along with third ranked green type at 4.9%, ashes combine to make up 11% percent of the city&#x27;s street trees, with an overall population of 13,648,044 million standing ashes within Cook County alone.

Autumn Purple, or Junginger, a wild variety of American white ash selected for its purple leaf color, was discovered by University of Wisconsin horticulturist Karl Junginger of McKay Nursery in Waterloo, Iowa. After its introduction in 1956, it quickly became the most popular and most expensive landscaping selection, surpassing the high priced ginkgo, London plane and white/burr oak. A related species, Biltmore ash, is sometimes treated as a variety of white ash. Other taxonomists argue that Biltmore ash is its own species (&quot;Fraxinus biltmoreana&quot;).

North American native ash tree species are used by North American frogs as a critical food source, as leaves that fall from the trees are particularly suitable for tadpoles to feed upon in ponds (both temporary and permanent), large puddles, and other water sources. Species such as red maple, which are taking the place of ash due to the ash borer, are much less suitable for the frogs as a food source—resulting in poor frog survival rates and small frog sizes. The lack of tannins in the American ash variety makes them a good food source for frogs, but are not resistant to the ash borer. Varieties of ash from outside North America typically have much higher tannin levels and resist the borer. Maples and various non-native invasive trees, trees that are taking the place of American ash species in the North American ecosystem, typically have much higher leaf tannin levels. Ash species native to North America also provide important habitat and food for various other creatures that are native to North America.

<text>Oleaceae, also known as the olive family or sometimes the lilac family, is a taxonomic family of flowering shrubs, trees, and a few lianas in the order Lamiales. It presently comprises 28 genera, one of which is recently extinct. The extant genera include &quot;Cartrema&quot;, which was resurrected in 2012. The number of species in the Oleaceae is variously estimated in a wide range around 700. The flowers are often numerous and highly odoriferous. The family has a subcosmopolitan distribution, ranging from the subarctic to the southernmost parts of Africa, Australia, and South America. Notable members include olive, ash, jasmine, and several popular ornamental plants including privet, forsythia, fringetrees, and lilac.

==Genera==
The following 29 extant genera are recognized in the family Oleaceae. &quot;Linociera&quot; is not included, even though some authors continue to recognize it. &quot;Linociera&quot; is not easy to distinguish from &quot;Chionanthus&quot;, mostly because the latter is polyphyletic and not clearly defined.

== Overview ==
The type genus for Oleaceae is &quot;Olea&quot;, the olives. Recent classifications recognize no subfamilies, but the family is divided into five tribes. The distinctiveness of each tribe has been strongly supported in molecular phylogenetic studies, but the relationships among the tribes were not clarified until 2014. The phylogenetic tree for Oleaceae is a 5-grade that can be represented as {Myxopyreae [Forsythieae (Fontanesieae &lt;Jasmineae + Oleeae&gt;)]}.

The major centers of diversity for Oleaceae are in Southeast Asia and Australia. There are also a significant number of species in Africa, China, and North America. In the tropics the family is represented in a variety of habitats, from low-lying dry forest to montane cloud forest. In Oleaceae, the seed dispersal is almost entirely by wind or animals. In the case that the fruit is a berry, the species is mostly dispersed by birds. The wind-dispersed fruits are samaras.

Some of the older works have recognized as many as 29 genera in Oleaceae. Today, most authors recognize at least 25, but this number will change because some of these genera have recently been shown to be polyphyletic.

Estimates of the number of species in Oleaceae have ranged from 600 to 900. Most of the species number discrepancy is due to the genus &quot;Jasminum&quot; in which as few as 200 or as many as 450 species have been accepted.

In spite of the sparsity of the fossil record, and the inaccuracy of molecular-clock dating, it is clear that Oleaceae is an ancient family that became widely distributed early in its history. Some of the genera are believed to be relictual populations that remained unchanged over long periods because of isolation imposed by geographical barriers like the low-elevation areas that separate mountain peaks.

== Description ==
Members of the family Oleaceae are woody plants, mostly trees and shrubs; a few are lianas. Some of the shrubs are , climbing by scrambling into other vegetation.

Leaves without stipules; simple or pinnately or ternately compound. The family is characterized by opposite leaves. Alternate or whorled arrangements are rarely observed, with some &quot;Jasminum&quot; species presenting a spiral configuration. The laminas are pinnately veined and can be serrate, dentate or entire at the margin. Domatia are observed in certain taxa. The leaves may be either deciduous or evergreen, with evergreen species predominating in warm temperate and tropical regions, and deciduous species predominating in colder regions.

The flowers are most often bisexual and actinomorphic, occurring in racemes or panicles, and often fragrant. The calyx and corolla, when present, are gamosepalous and gamopetalous, respectively, their lobes connate, at least at the base. The androecium has 2 stamens. These are inserted on the corolla tube and alternate with the corolla lobes. The stigmas are two-lobed. The gynoecium consists of a compound pistil with two carpels. The ovary is superior with two locules. The placentation is axile. Ovules usually 2 per locule; sometimes 4, rarely many. Nectary disk, when present, encircling the base of the ovary. The plants are most often hermaphrodite but sometimes polygamomonoecious.

The fruit can be a berry, drupe, capsule or samaras.

The obvious feature that distinguishes Oleaceae and its sister family, Carlemanniaceae, from all others, is the fact that while the flowers are actinomorphic, the number of stamens is reduced to two.

Many members of the family are economically significant. The olive (&quot;Olea europaea&quot;) is important for its fruit and for the olive oil extracted from it. The ashes (&quot;Fraxinus&quot;) are valued for their tough wood. Forsythias, lilacs, jasmines, osmanthuses, privets, and fringe trees are valued as ornamental plants in gardens and landscaping. At least two species of jasmine are the source of an essential oil. Their flowers are often added to tea.

== History ==
Carl Linnaeus named eight of the genera of Oleaceae in 1753 in his Species Plantarum. He did not designate what we now know as plant families, but placed his genera in artificial groups for purposes of identification. After the work of Linnaeus, names for groups that included the genera of Oleaceae were used, but none of them was a valid publication of the family name Oleaceae. For example, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, in his &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot; in 1789, placed them in an order which he called &quot;Jasmineae&quot;. In 1809, in a flora of Portugal, Johann Centurius Hoffmannsegg and Johann H.F. Link described at the taxonomic rank of family a group which they called &quot;Oleinae&quot;. Their description is now regarded as the establishment of what we now know as Oleaceae.

The last revision of Oleaceae was published in 2004 in a series entitled &quot;The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants&quot;. Since that time, molecular phylogenetic work has shown that the next revision of Oleaceae must include substantial changes to the circumscription of genera.

== Classification ==
Oleaceae is most closely related to the small Indo-Malesian family Carlemanniaceae. These two families form the second most basal clade in the order Lamiales, after Plocospermataceae. The families Plocospermataceae, Carlemanniaceae, Oleaceae, and Tetrachondraceae form a polyphyletic group known as the &quot;basal Lamiales&quot;, which is in contrast to the monophyletic &quot;core Lamiales&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
Oleaceae is one of only a few major plant families for which no well-sampled molecular phylogenetic study has ever been conducted. The only DNA sequence study of the entire family sampled 76 species for two noncoding chloroplast loci, &quot;rps16&quot; and &quot;trnL–F&quot;. Little was determined in this study, largely because the mutation rate in the chloroplast genome of Oleaceae is very low compared to that of most other angiosperm families.

Also, the family is notorious for incongruence between phylogenies based on plastid and nuclear DNA. The most likely cause of this incongruence is reticulate evolution resulting from rampant hybridization.

The delimitation of genera in Oleaceae has always been especially problematic. Some recent studies of small groups of related genera have shown that some of the genera are not monophyletic. For example, &quot;Olea&quot; section &quot;Tetrapilus&quot; is separate from the rest of &quot;Olea&quot;. It is a distinct group of 23 species and had been named as a genus, &quot;Tetrapilus&quot;, by João de Loureiro in 1790.

The genus &quot;Ligustrum&quot; has long been suspected of having originated from within &quot;Syringa&quot;, and this was confirmed in a cladistic comparison of selected chloroplast genes.

&quot;Osmanthus&quot; consists of at least three lineages whose closest relatives are not other lineages of &quot;Osmanthus&quot;.

&quot;Chionanthus&quot; is highly polyphyletic, with its species scattered across the phylogenetic tree of the subtribe Oleinae. Its African species are closer to &quot;Noronhia&quot; than to its type species, the North American &quot;Chionanthus virginicus&quot;. Its Madagascan species are phylogenetically within &quot;Noronhia&quot; and will be formally transferred to it in a forthcoming paper.

The monophyly of &quot;Nestegis&quot; is in considerable doubt, but few of its closest relatives have been sampled in phylogenetic studies.

<text>In Greek mythology, Apate (; Ancient Greek: Ἀπάτη &quot;Apátē&quot;) is the goddess and personification of deceit. Her mother is Nyx, the personification of the night. In Roman mythology her equivalent is Fraus (Fraud), while her male counterpart is Dolus (Deception), and her opposite number Aletheia, the goddess of truth.

== Family ==
Apate was the daughter of the primordial deities Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night).

== Mythology ==
The only myth in which Apate appeared was that of the affair between Zeus, king of the gods, and Semele, a Theban princess who bore him the god of wine, Dionysus. After knowing this infidelity of her husband, Hera sought the help of Apate in her scheme of punishing the mortal paramour of Zeus. Apate then willingly gave her a magical girdle which Hera then used to trick Semele into asking Zeus to appear before in his true form which resulted in her death (i.e. Semele) because no mortal being can directly gaze the presence of a god. The story as recounted in Nonnus&#x27; Dionysiaca were as follows:

[Hera learns Semele is pregnant with a child of Zeus:] Nor did the consort of Zeus [Hera] abate her heavy anger. She stormed with flying shoe through the heaven bespangled with tis pattern of shining stars, she coursed through innumerable cities with travelling foot, seeking if anywhere she could find Apate (Deceit) the crafty one. But when high above Korybantian Dikte (Corybantian Dicte) she beheld the child bed water of neighbouring Amnisos, the fickle deity met her there on the hills; for she was fond of the Kretans (Cretans) for they are always liars, and she used to stay by the false tomb of Zeus. About her hips was a Kydonian (Cydonian) cincture, which contains all the cunning bewitchment of mankind : trickery with its many shifts, cajoling seduction, all the shapes of guile, perjury itself which flies on the winds of heaven.Then subtle minded Hera began to coax wily Apate (Deceit) with wily words, hoping to have revenge on her husband: &quot;Good greeting, lady of wily mind and wily snares! Not Hermes Hoaxthewits himself can outdo you with his plausible prittleprattle! Lend me also that girdle or many colours, which Rheia once bound about her flanks when she deceived her husband [Kronos (Cronus)]! I bring no prettified shape for my Kronion (Cronion) [Zeus], I do not trick my husband with a wily stone. No! a woman of the earth compels me whose bed makes furious Ares declare that he will house in heaven no more! What do I profit by being a goddess immortal? ... I am afraid Kronides (Cronides), who is called my husband and brother, will banish me from heaven for a woman&#x27;s bed, afraid he may make Semele queen of his Olympos! If you favour Zeus Kronion more than Hera, if you will not give me your all-bewitching girdle to bring back again to Olympos my wandering son, I will leave heaven because of their earthly marriage, I will go to the uttermost bounds of Okeanos (Oceanus) and share the hearth of primeval Tethys; thence I will pass to the house of and abide with Ophion. Come then, honour the mother of all [Hera], the bride of Zeus, and lend me the help of your girdle, that I may charm my runaway son furious Ares, to make heaven once more his home.When she had finished, the goddess replied with obedient words: &quot;Mother of Enyalios (i.e. Ares), bride first enthroned of Zeus! I will give my girdle and anything else you ask me; I obey, since you reign over the gods with Kronion. Receive this sash; bind it about your bosom, and you may bring back Ares to heaven. If you like, charm the mind of Zeus, and if it is necessary, charm Okeanos also from his anger. Zeus sovereign in the heights will leave his earthly loves and return self-bidden to heaven he will change his mind by my guileful girdle. This one puts to shame the heart bewitching girdle of the Paphian [Aphrodite].&quot; This said, the wilyminded deity was off under the wind, cleaving the air with flying shoe.

<text>Phalaris () was the tyrant of Akragas (now Agrigento) in Sicily in Magna Graecia, from approximately 570 to 554 BC.

==History==

Phalaris was renowned for his excessive cruelty. Among his alleged atrocities is cannibalism: he was said to have eaten suckling babies.

Another expression of his sadistic brutality is that he supposedly ordered a sculptor named Perilaus to make him a brazen hollow bull. The bull could hold a man and was used as an execution machine. The condemned person was placed inside, then the bull was closed and a fire lit underneath. The sculpture was made in such a way that, while the condemned met a horrible death in the burning furnace, their cries were said to sound like the bellowing of a bull.

Phalaris was entrusted with the building of the temple of Zeus Atabyrius in the citadel and took advantage of his position to make himself despot. Under his rule, Agrigentum seemed to have attained considerable prosperity. He supplied the city with water, adorned it with fine buildings, and strengthened it with walls. On the northern coast of the island, the people of Himera elected him general with absolute power, in spite of the warnings of the poet Stesichorus. According to the &quot;Suda&quot; he succeeded in making himself master of the whole of the island.

He was at last overthrown in a general uprising headed by Telemachus, the ancestor of Theron of Acragas (tyrant c. 488–472 BC), and burned in his own brazen bull. Pindar, who lived less than a century afterwards, expressly associates this instrument of torture with the name of the tyrant, while Lucian mentions it in two satirical dialogues, &quot;Phalaris A&quot; and &quot;Phalaris B&quot;, he wrote about the tyrant.

There was certainly a brazen bull at Agrigentum that was carried off by the Carthaginians to Carthage. This is said to have been later taken by Scipio Africanus and restored to Agrigentum circa 200 BC. However, it is more likely that it was Scipio Aemilianus who returned this bull and other stolen works of art to the original Sicilian cities, after his total destruction of Carthage circa 146 BC, which ended the Third Punic War.

==Literary rehabilitation==
Despite his alleged cruelties, Phalaris gained in medieval times a certain literary fame as the supposed author of an epistolary corpus. In 1699, Richard Bentley published an influential &quot;Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris&quot;, in which he proved that the epistles were misattributed and had actually been written around the 2nd century AD.

<text>Aphaia (, &quot;Aphaía&quot;) was a Greek goddess who was worshipped almost exclusively at a single sanctuary on the island of Aegina in the Saronic Gulf.

== Cult and worship ==
She originated as early as the 14th century BCE as a local deity associated with fertility and the agricultural cycle. Under the later Athenian hegemony she came to be identified with the goddesses Athena and Artemis and with the nymph Britomartis as well, by the 2nd century CE, the time of Pausanias:

On &quot;Aegina&quot; as one goes toward the mountain of Zeus, god of all the Hellenes, the sanctuary of &quot;Aphaia&quot; comes up, for whom Pindar composed an ode at the behest of the Aeginetans. The Cretans say (the myths about her are native to Crete) that Euboulos was the son of Kharmanor, who purified Apollo of the killing of the Python, and they say that Britomartis was the daughter of Zeus and Kharme (the daughter of this Euboulos). She enjoyed races and hunts and was particularly dear to Artemis. While fleeing from Minos, who lusted after her, she cast herself into nets cast for a catch of fish. Artemis made her a goddess, and not only the Cretans but also the Aeginetans revere her. The Aeginetans say that Britomartis showed herself to them on their island. Her epithet among the Aeginetans is &quot;Aphaia&quot;, and it is &quot;Diktynna of the Nets&quot; on Crete.
Description of Greece 2.30.3

The remains of the Late Archaic period Temple of Aphaia are located within a sanctuary complex on a 160 meter peak at the northeastern end of the island: 37°45&#x27;14.82&quot;N, 23°32&#x27;0.24&quot;E. The extant temple was built at around 500 BCE on the site of an earlier temple that had burned around 510 BCE.

An inscribed potsherd of the 5th century BCE found in the precinct of the Temple of Apollo at Bassae in Arcadia is inscribed with what may be a dedication to Aphaia. If so, it would be the first known inscribed dedication to this goddess outside Aegina.

<text>Britomartis (;) was a Greek goddess of mountains and hunting, who was primarily worshipped on the island of Crete. She was sometimes believed to be an oread, a mountain nymph, but she was often conflated or syncretized with Artemis and Aphaea, the &quot;invisible&quot; patroness of Aegina. She is also known as Dictynna or as a daughter of Dictynna (Δίκτυννα).

In the 16th century, the naming of a character identified with English military prowess as &quot;Britomart&quot; in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s knightly epic &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; led to a number of appearances by &quot;Britomart&quot; figures in British art and literature.

==Etymology==
According to Solinus, the name &#x27;Britomartis&#x27; is from a Cretan dialect; he also says that her name means &quot;virgo dulcis&quot;, or &quot;sweet virgin&quot;. Solinus also identifies her explicitly as the Cretan Artemis. Hesychius of Alexandria also equates the Cretan word βριτύ (&quot;britý&quot;) with Greek γλυκύ (&quot;glyký&quot;) &#x27;sweet&#x27;. Other scholars have argued that &quot;Britomartis&quot; (&quot;sweet maid&quot;) is an epithet that does not reveal the goddess&#x27;s name, nor her character, instead arguing that it may be a noa-name.

==Mythology==
The goddess was frequently portrayed on Cretan coinage, either as herself or as Diktynna, the goddess of Mount Dikte, Zeus&#x27; birthplace. As Diktynna, she was depicted as a winged goddess with a human face, standing atop her ancient mountain, grasping an animal in each hand, in the guise of &quot;Potnia Theron&quot;, the mistress of animals.

By Hellenistic and Roman times, Britomartis was given a genealogical setting that cast her into a Classical context:

Britomartis, who is also called Dictynna, the myths relate, was born at Caeno in Crete of Zeus and Carmê, the daughter of Eubulus who was the son of Demeter; she invented the nets (dictya) which are used in hunting.

The third hymn to Artemis by Callimachus tells how she was pursued by Minos and, as Diktynna, &quot;Lady of the Nets&quot;, threw herself into fishermen&#x27;s nets to escape him; thus rescued, she was taken by the fishermen to mainland Greece. She was also known as Dicte. This myth element &quot;explains&quot; the spread of the Cretan goddess&#x27;s cult to Greece. Diodorus Siculus found it less than credible:

But those men who tell the tale that she has been named Dictynna because she fled into some fishermen&#x27;s nets when she was pursued by Minos, who would have ravished her, have missed the truth; for it is not a probable story that the goddess should ever have got into so helpless a state that she would have required the aid that men can give, being as she is the daughter of the greatest one of the gods.

Strabo notes she was venerated as Diktynna only in western Crete, in the region of Cydonia, where there was a &quot;Diktynnaion&quot;, or temple of Diktynna. &quot;Oupis [Artemis], O queen, fairfaced Bringer of Light, thee too the Kretans name after that Nymph,&quot; Callimachus says. &quot;She passed her time in the company of Artemis, this being the reason why some men think Diktynna and Artemis are one and the same goddess,&quot; Diodorus Siculus (5.76.3) suggested. 

In the second century CE, the Greek writer Pausanias describes Britomartis saying, &quot;She was made a goddess by Artemis, and she is worshipped, not only by the Cretans, but also by the Aiginetans.&quot;

Antoninus Liberalis wrote that after escaping Minos, she arrived at Aegina, but a local fisherman named Andromedes tried to lay hands on her, so she jumped off her boat, and became known as Aphaea, a local Aeginetan goddess, whose name Antoninus interprets as &#x27;she who disappeared&#x27;. In Britomartis&#x27;s place, a statue appeared in a temple of Artemis in Aegina. 

== As Diktynna ==
A &quot;xoanon&quot;, a wooden cult statue, of Britomartis, allegedly carved by Daedalus, sat in the temple of Olous. In Chersonesos and Olous, she was often portrayed on coins, showing that she was worshipped in those cities; the festival Britomarpeia was held in her honor. As Diktynna, her face was pictured on Cretan coins of Kydonia, Polyrrhenia and Phalasarna as the nurse of Zeus. On Crete, she was connected with the mountain where Zeus was said to have been born—Mount Dikte. On some early Britomartis coins of Kydonia, the coin was manufactured as an overstrike of specimens manufactured by Aegina.

Temples dedicated to her existed in Athens, Sparta, Massalia and between Ambrosus and Anticyra in Phocis, where, as Artemis Diktynna, her cult object was a black stone worked by Aeginetans, but she was primarily a goddess of local importance in Western Crete, such as Lysos and West of Kydonia. Her temples were said to be guarded by vicious dogs stronger than bears. A temple dedicated to the goddess was erected in ancient times on Mount Tityros near Cydonia. Another name, Pipituna, found on Linear B may be another form of Diktynna.

== As Aphaea ==
Britomartis was worshipped as Aphaea primarily on the island of Aegina, where the temple &quot;Athena Aphaea&quot; stood. A temple dedicated to her also existed at the Aspropyrgos on the outskirts of Athens.

== Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Britomart&quot; ==

Britomart figures in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s knightly epic &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, where she is an allegorical figure of the virgin Knight of Chastity, representing English virtue—in particular, English military power—through a folk etymology that associated &quot;Brit-,&quot; as in &quot;Briton&quot;, with &quot;Martis&quot;, here thought of as &quot;of Mars&quot;, the Roman war god. In Spenser&#x27;s allegory, Britomart connotes the Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I of England.

In his retelling of the King Arthur legends, &quot;Arthur Rex&quot;, author Thomas Berger suggests that Queen Guinevere may have become a powerful female knight known as Britomart after the death of the King.

<text>Fruit trees are grown in a variety of shapes, sometimes for aesthetic appeal but mainly to encourage fruit production. The form or shape of fruit trees can be manipulated by pruning and training. Shaping and promoting a particular tree form is undertaken to establish the plant in a particular situation under certain environmental conditions, to increase fruit yield, and to enhance fruit quality. For example, pruning a tree to a pyramid shape enables trees to be planted closer together. An open bowl or cup form helps sunlight penetrate the canopy, thus encouraging a high fruit yield whilst keeping the tree short and accessible for harvesting. Other shapes such as cordons, espaliers and fans provide opportunities for growing trees two dimensionally against walls or fences, or they can be trained to function as barriers.

==Forms==

Some of the following fruit tree forms require training by tying the branches to the required form. Most also require pruning to retain the desired structure. However, not all types of fruit tree are suitable for all forms; apples and pears do well as cordons and espaliers, for example, whereas cherries are better suited to the fan form.

===Bush===
An open-centred crown on a short trunk of less than . This is a traditional and popular form for apple trees. Bush trees are easy to maintain and bear fruit at a young age. Final height is between and , depending on which rootstock is used.

===Standard===
Larger than the bush form, with trunks of or more. Standard trees can reach a total height of . They eventually produce high yields but, being large trees, are not easy to maintain.

===Pyramid===
Similar to the bush form, although the main leader shoot is allowed to maintain its dominance, resulting in a pyramidal shape.

===Spindlebush===
A variant of the pyramid form in which the lateral branches are tied down to a horizontal position. 
Designed for dense orchards by Otto Schmitz-Hübsch and Heinrichs in Germany in 1936, this is currently the most popular training system for dwarf apple and pear trees.

===Cordon===
Single-stemmed trees planted at an angle (usually 45°), with fruiting spurs encouraged to form along the stem. Any side branches are removed by pruning. Cordons take less space and crop earlier than most other forms, so more varieties can be grown in a given space, but yields are smaller per tree. A special cordon set-up is the Bouché-Thomas system.

===Espalier===
A central vertical trunk with three or four horizontal branches on each side. A special espalier in this group is the LePage-system.

===Fan===
A short central trunk with several radiating branches growing from the crown.

===Step-over espalier===
Espaliers with just one tier of horizontal branches above the ground. These make a novel and productive border for a vegetable plot.

A study on orchard mango trees in Nelspruit, South Africa, compared the open vase, closed vase, central leader, palmette and standard pruning systems and recommended a modified pyramid, somewhere between a central leader and a closed vase system, for high-density mango orchards. The study also evaluated both post-fruit-set and post-harvest pruning, indicating that late mango cultivars benefit from pruning while bearing fruit in late fall, while early cultivars may be best pruned immediately after harvest.

<doc id="78941" wikidata="Q493081" url="?curid=78941" title="Paco Gento">
<text>Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Gento López (21 October 1933 – 18 January 2022) was a Spanish footballer who played as an outside left. A fast runner, Gento was referred to as the &quot;Gale of the Cantabrian Sea&quot; () in reference to his speed down the wing. He was voted by IFFHS (International Federation of Football History and Statistics) as the greatest Spanish footballer and 30th greatest world footballer of the 20th century. Gento is also widely regarded as one of the greatest wingers in the history of the sport.

Gento began his career at Racing Santander in 1952 and moved to Real Madrid the following season. He appeared in a joint record eight European Cup finals, winning a joint record six, as well as winning a record 12 La Liga titles. In a 14-year international career, Gento earned 43 caps for Spain, playing at the World Cup in 1962 and 1966.

Following the death of Alfredo Di Stéfano in 2014, Gento was appointed the Honorary President of Real Madrid.

==Club career==
Gento debuted in the &quot;Primera División&quot; with Racing Santander in the 1952–53 season. He was still playing mostly for the B team at Santander when a flu virus saw him promoted to the first team ahead of a home game against Real Madrid. Such was his performance in the match, that Madrid signed him three days later. 

La &quot;Galerna del Cantábrico&quot; (The Gale of the Cantabrian Sea), as he was known, played outside left and was noted for his exceptional pace, his skills with the ball and his scoring prowess from the midfield position. In 1967, following Alfredo Di Stéfano&#x27;s departure and Ferenc Puskás&#x27;s retirement, he became the captain of a young side, known in Spain as &quot;Ye-yé&quot;, because of the popularity of The Beatles at that time.

Gento did not score in his first season and was under pressure from club president Santiago Bernabéu. The president was won over by Di Stéfano&#x27;s argument &quot;he is quick and hits the ball like a cannon. That can&#x27;t be learned, it&#x27;s innate. We can teach him the rest&quot;.
Among other honors, Gento won the European Cup a record six times with Real Madrid between 1955 and 1966 being the only Madrid player to figure in all of the wins (a record since equalled by Nacho, Luka Modrić and Dani Carvajal). He contributed with 31 goals in 88 European Cup career matches.

Gento played in eight European Cup finals, with a 6–2 record, and he also appeared in a ninth European final appearance in the 1970–1971 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final that Real Madrid lost to Chelsea. He holds this record jointly with Milan&#x27;s Paolo Maldini, who has an inferior 5–3 record. Gento&#x27;s legendary Real Madrid teammate, Alfredo Di Stéfano&#x27;s 5–2 record comes third.Domestically, Gento collected 12 La Liga titles during his time with Madrid. He scored 128 times in 428 league appearances for the club, a strong return for a winger, especially as he was often providing goals for teammates Di Stéfano and Puskás. He won 23 trophies for the club, which remained an outright record until equalled by Marcelo days before Gento&#x27;s death.

After he retired from football in 1971, he coached various lower-league teams, such as Castilla, Castellón, Palencia, and Granada. In 1978–79, he led Palencia to promotion to the Segunda División for the first time in their history. He later took up a role as an ambassador for Real Madrid throughout Europe, alongside Di Stéfano. After Di Stéfano died in 2014, Gento became the honorary president of the club.

==International career==
Gento played for the Spain national team from 1955 to 1969, winning 43 caps and scoring five times. His debut came on 18 May 1955 in a 1–1 draw with England in Madrid. He was initially known as &quot;La tercera G&quot; (the third G) for succeeding Agustín Gaínza and Guillermo Gorostiza in his position. His rival for his position was his friend Enrique Collar of Atlético Madrid, and the pair played together at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile.

In 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup qualification, Gento was included alongside Collar under new manager José Villalonga, but was dropped after a home defeat to Belgium on 1 December 1963; Carlos Lapetra took his place for the finals which Spain won. Due to improved form and fitness in the second half of the 1965–66 season, he was recalled for the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, playing all three games of a group-stage elimination.

Shortly before turning 36, Gento was given his 43rd and final cap on 15 October 1969 by his former teammate László Kubala, in a 6–0 win over already eliminated Finland in 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification. He ended short of the record of 46 caps by Ricardo Zamora.

==Personal life and death==

Gento&#x27;s two younger brothers, Julio (1939–2016) and Antonio (1940–2020) also played football professionally; the latter played for Real Madrid, too, but they were not as successful as their older brother Francisco.

His nephews were also athletes – José Luis Llorente and Toñín Llorente played basketball, whilst Paco Llorente and Julio Llorente were footballers. Grand-nephew Marcos Llorente, son of Paco Llorente, is also a footballer.

Gento died in his sleep on 18 January 2022, at the age of 88.

Real Madrid announced in a statement, &quot;Real Madrid would like to express its condolences and its love and affection to his wife Mari Luz, his sons Francisco and Julio, his granddaughters Aitana and Candela and all his relatives, colleagues and loved ones, he will always be remembered by Madridistas and all football fans as one of their greatest.&quot; FIFA President Gianni Infantino said, “I am deeply saddened to learn of Paco Gento’s passing today at the age of 88. One of the greatest players of his generation, Paco leaves behind a lifetime of memories for all fans of football, but especially those of Spain and Real Madrid. Our thoughts and best wishes go to Paco’s family and friends, to Real Madrid, to the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and to all those who treasure memories of this great player.”

==Legacy==
Regarded as one of the greatest Spanish players of all time and one of the greatest ever players in his position, Gento was an extremely fast left winger, which made him an effective assist provider with high accuracy in his crosses.

<doc id="78943" wikidata="Q989960" url="?curid=78943" title="North Platte, Nebraska">
<text>North Platte is a city in and the county seat of Lincoln County, Nebraska, United States. It is located in the west-central part of the state, along Interstate 80, at the confluence of the North and South Platte Rivers forming the Platte River. The population was 23,390 at the 2020 census, making it the 11th most populous city in Nebraska.

North Platte is a railroad town; Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s large Bailey Yard is located within the city. Today, North Platte is served only by freight trains, but during World War II the city was known for the North Platte Canteen, a volunteer organization serving food to millions of traveling soldiers.

North Platte is the principal city of the North Platte Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Lincoln, Logan, and McPherson counties.

==History==

North Platte was established in 1866 when the Union Pacific Railroad was extended to that point. It derives its name from the North Platte River.

North Platte was the western terminus of the Union Pacific Railway from December 1866 until the next section to Ogallala was opened the following year. Even though Congress had authorized the building of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1862, it had been extended only as far as Fremont, Nebraska by the end of the 1865 construction season. The section from Fremont to North Platte was completed in 1866.
In the 1880s, Buffalo Bill Cody established his ranch, known as Scout&#x27;s Rest Ranch, just north of town. It is now a National Historic Landmark.

On July 13, 1929, a black man shot and killed a white police officer. The black man reportedly took his own life, being trapped by a mob. This led to the formation of white mobs combing the city, and ordering black residents to leave North Platte. Fearing mob violence, most of North Platte&#x27;s black residents fled.
The North Platte Canteen was one of the largest volunteer efforts of World War II, originating in 1941. Tens of thousands of volunteers from North Platte and surrounding towns met the troop trains passing through North Platte, offering coffee, sandwiches, dessert, and hospitality to nearly seven million servicemen.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===

North Platte experiences a dry continental climate similar to that of the Nebraska High Plains, classified as hot-summer humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dcao&quot;), and, with an annual average precipitation of , barely avoids semi-arid classification; it is part of USDA Hardiness zone 5a. The normal monthly mean temperature ranges from in January to in July. On an average year, there are 3.8 afternoons that reach or higher, 39 afternoons that reach or higher, 31.4 afternoons that do not climb above freezing, and 12.2 mornings with a low of or below.

<text>Hemoglobinopathy is the medical term for a group of inherited blood disorders involving the hemoglobin, the major protein of red blood cells. They are generally single-gene disorders and, in most cases, they are inherited as autosomal recessive traits.

There are two main groups: abnormal structural hemoglobin variants caused by mutations in the hemoglobin genes, and the thalassemias, which are caused by an underproduction of otherwise normal hemoglobin molecules. The main structural hemoglobin variants are HbS, HbE and HbC. The main types of thalassemia are alpha-thalassemia and beta thalassemia.

==Hemoglobin functions==
Hemoglobin is a protein containing iron that facilitates the transportation of oxygen in red blood cells. Hemoglobin in the blood carries oxygen from the lungs to the other tissues of the body, where it releases the oxygen to enable aerobic respiration which powers the metabolism. Normal levels of hemoglobin vary according to sex and age in the range 9.5 to 17.2 grams of hemoglobin in every deciliter of blood.

Hemoglobin also transports other gases. It carries off some of the body&#x27;s respiratory carbon dioxide (about 20–25% of the total) as carbaminohemoglobin, in which CO2 binds to the heme protein. The molecule also carries the important regulatory molecule nitric oxide bound to a thiol group in the globin protein, releasing it at the same time as oxygen.

== Hemoglobin structural biology ==

Normal human hemoglobins are tetrameric proteins composed of two pairs of globin chains, each of which contains one alpha-like (α) globin and one beta-like (β) globin. Each globin chain is associated with an iron-containing heme moiety. Throughout life, the synthesis of the α and the β chains is balanced so that their ratio is relatively constant and there is no excess of either type.

The specific α and β chains that are incorporated into Hb are highly regulated during development:
* Embryonic Hb are expressed as early as four to six weeks of embryogenesis and disappear around the eighth week of gestation as they are replaced by fetal Hb. Embryonic Hbs include:
** Hb Gower-1, composed of two ζ (zeta) globins and two ε (epsilon) globins, i.e., ζ2ε2
** Hb Gower-2, composed of two α globins and two ε globins (α2ε2)
** Hb Portland, composed of two ζ globins and two γ (gamma) globins (ζ2γ2)
* Fetal Hb (HbF) is produced from approximately eight weeks of gestation through birth and constitutes approximately 80 percent of Hb in the full-term neonate. It declines during the first few months of life and, in the normal state, constitutes &lt;1 percent of total Hb by early childhood. HbF is composed of two α globins and two γ globins (α2γ2).
* Adult Hb (HbA) is the predominant Hb in children by six months of age and onward; it constitutes 96-97% of total Hb in individuals without a hemoglobinopathy. It is composed of two α globins and two β globins (α2β2).
* HbA2 is a minor adult Hb that normally accounts for approximately 2.5–3.5% of total Hb from six months of age onward. It is composed of two α globins and two δ (delta) globins (α2δ2).

== Classification of hemoglobinopathies ==

=== A) Qualitative ===

==== Structural abnormalities ====
Hemoglobin structural variants manifest a change in the structure of the Hb molecule. The majority of hemoglobin variants do not cause disease and are most commonly discovered either incidentally or through newborn screening. Hb variants can usually be detected by protein-based assay methods such as electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, or high-performance liquid chromatography. Diagnosis is commonly confirmed by DNA sequencing.

The hemoglobin structural variants can be broadly classified as follows:
* Sickle cell disorders, which are the most prevalent form of hemoglobinopathy. Sickle hemoglobin (HbS) is prone to polymerize when deoxygenated, precipitating within the red blood cell. This damages the RBC membrane resulting in its premature destruction and consequent anemia.
* Unstable hemoglobin variants are mutations that cause the hemoglobin molecule to precipitate, spontaneously or upon oxidative stress, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Precipitated, denatured hemoglobin can attach to the inner layer of the plasma membrane of the red blood cell (RBC) forming Heinz bodies, leading to premature destruction of the RBC and anemia.
* Change in oxygen affinity. High or low oxygen affinity hemoglobin molecules are more likely than normal to adopt the relaxed (R, oxy) state or the tense (T, deoxy) state, respectively. High oxygen affinity variants (R state) cause polycythemia (e.g., Hb Chesapeake, Hb Montefiore). Low oxygen affinity variants can cause cyanosis (e.g., Hb Kansas, Hb Beth Israel).

====Chemical abnormalities====
Methemoglobinemia is a condition caused by elevated levels of methemoglobin in the blood. Methaemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin that contains the ferric [Fe3+] form of iron, instead of the ferrous [Fe2+] form . Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen, which means it cannot carry oxygen to tissues. In human blood a trace amount of methemoglobin is normally produced spontaneously; the enzyme methemoglobin reductase is responsible for converting methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. Methemoglobinemia can be hereditary but more commonly occurs as a side effect of certain medications or by abuse of recreational drugs.

===B) Quantitative===

==== Production abnormalities ====
Thalassemias are quantitative defects that lead to reduced levels of one type of globin chain, creating an imbalance in the ratio of alpha-like chains to beta-like chains. This ratio is normally tightly regulated to prevent excess globin chains of one type from accumulating. The excess chains that fail to incorporate into normal hemoglobin can form non-functional aggregates that precipitate. This can lead to premature RBC destruction in the bone marrow and/or in the peripheral blood. Thalassemia subtypes of clinical significance are alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. A third subtype, delta thalassemia, affects production of HBA2 and is generally asymptomatic.

The severity of alpha thalassemia depends on how many of the four genes that code for alpha globin are faulty. In the fetus, a deficiency of alpha globin results in the production of Hemoglobin Barts - a dysfunctional hemoglobin that consists of four gamma globins. In this situation, a fetus will develop hydrops fetalis and normally die before or shortly after birth. In adults alpha thalassemia manifests as HbH disease. In this, excess beta-globin forms β-tetramers, which accumulate and precipitate in red blood cells, damaging their membranes. Damaged RBCs are removed by the spleen resulting in moderate to severe anemia.

In beta thalassemia, reduced production of beta globin, combined with a normal synthesis of alpha globin, results in an accumulation of excess unmatched alpha globin. This precipitates in the red cell precursors in the bone marrow, triggering their premature destruction. Anemia in beta thalassemia results from a combination of ineffective production of RBCs, peripheral hemolysis, and an overall reduction in hemoglobin synthesis.

== Combination hemoglobinopathies ==
A combination hemoglobinopathy occurs when someone inherits two different abnormal hemoglobin genes. If these are different versions of the same gene, one having been inherited from each parent it is an example of compound heterozygosity.

Both alpha- and beta- thalassemia can coexist with other hemoglobinopathies. Combinations involving alpha thalassemia are generally benign.

Some examples of clinically significant combinations involving beta thalassemia include:

* Hemoglobin C/ beta thalassemia: common in Mediterranean and African populations generally results in a moderate form of anemia with splenomegaly.
* Hemoglobin D/ beta thalassemia: common in the northwestern parts of India and Pakistan (Punjab region).

* Hemoglobin E/ beta thalassemia: common in Cambodia, Thailand, and parts of India, it is clinically similar to β thalassemia major or β thalassemia intermedia.
* Hemoglobin S/ beta thalassemia: common in African and Mediterranean populations, it is clinically similar to sickle-cell anemia.
* Delta-beta thalassemia is a rare form of thalassemia in which there is a reduced production of both the delta and beta globins. It is generally asymptomatic.

There are two clinically significant combinations involving the sickle cell gene:

* Hemoglobin S/ beta thalassemia: (see above).
* Hemoglobin S/ hemoglobin C (Hemoglobin SC disease) occurs when an individual inherits one gene for hemoglobin S (sickle cell) and one gene for hemoglobin C, The symptoms are very similar to sickle cell disease.

== Hemoglobin variants ==
Hemoglobin variants are not necessarily pathological. For example, Hb Lepore-Boston and G-Waimanalo are two variants which are non-pathological. There are in excess of 1,000 known hemoglobin variants. A research database of hemoglobin variants is maintained by Penn State University. A few of these variants are listed below.

=== Normal hemoglobins ===

; Embryonic

* HbE Gower 1 (ζ2ε2)
* HbE Gower 2 (α2ε2)
* HbE Portland I (ζ2γ2)
* HbE Portland II (ζ2β2)

; Fetal

* HbF/Fetal (α2γ2) dominating during pregnancy and reducing close to zero a few weeks after birth
* HbA (α2β2) Adult hemoglobin, present in small quantities during pregnancy 

; Adult

* HbA (α2β2) comprising approximately 97% of adult hemoglobin 
* HbA2 (α2δ2) comprising approximately 3% of adult hemoglobin 
* HbF/Fetal (α2γ2) dominating during pregnancy and reducing close to zero after birth

=== Relatively common abnormal hemoglobins ===

* HbS (α2βS2) causing sickle cell disease
* HbC (α2βC2) causing mild anemia if homozygous 
* HbE (α2βE2) causing mild anemia if homozygous
* HbD causing mild anemia if homozygous
* HbH formed from 4 beta globins in severe alpha thalassemia causing severe anemia

==Evolutionary advantage==
Some hemoglobinopathies seem to have given an evolutionary benefit, especially to heterozygotes, in areas where malaria is endemic. Malaria parasites infect red blood cells, but subtly disturb normal cellular function and subvert the immune response. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increased chance of survival for the carrier of an abnormal hemoglobin trait.

<text>Paul Ehrenfest (18 January 1880 – 25 September 1933) was an Austrian theoretical physicist who made major contributions to statistical mechanics and its relation to quantum mechanics, including the theory of phase transition and the Ehrenfest theorem. He befriended Albert Einstein on a visit to Prague in 1912 and became a professor in Leiden, where he frequently hosted Einstein. He died by murder-suicide in 1933, killing his disabled son, Wassik, and then himself.

== Biography ==
Paul Ehrenfest was born on 18 January 1880 in Vienna to Jewish parents, who were originally from Loštice in Moravia (now part of the Czech Republic). His parents, Sigmund Ehrenfest and Johanna Jellinek, managed a grocery store. Although the family was not overly religious, Paul studied Hebrew and Jewish history. Later, he always emphasized his Jewish ancestry. Ehrenfest excelled in grade school but did not do well at the Akademisches Gymnasium, his best subject being mathematics. After transferring to the Franz Josef Gymnasium, his marks improved. In 1899, he passed the final exams.

He majored in chemistry at the Vienna Institute of Technology, but took courses at the University of Vienna, in particular from Ludwig Boltzmann on his kinetic theory of thermodynamics. These lectures had a profound influence: they were instrumental in developing Ehrenfest&#x27;s interest in theoretical physics, defined his main area of research for years to come, and provided an example of inspired teaching. At the time, it was customary in the German-speaking world to study at more than one university, and in 1901, Ehrenfest transferred to University of Göttingen, which until 1933 was an important site for mathematics and theoretical physics. There he met his future wife, Tatyana Afanasyeva, a young mathematician born in Kiev (then the capital of the Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire) and educated in St Petersburg. In 1903, he met Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz during a short visit to Leiden, Netherlands. He wrote his dissertation on &quot;Die Bewegung starrer Körper in Flüssigkeiten und die Mechanik von Hertz&quot; (&quot;The Motion of Rigid Bodies in Fluids and the Mechanics of Hertz&quot;) and obtained his Ph.D. on 23 June 1904 in Vienna, where he stayed from 1904 to 1905.

On 21 December 1904, he married Afanasyeva, who collaborated with him in his work. They had two daughters and two sons: Tatyana (&#x27;Tanja&#x27;) (1905–1984) also became a mathematician; Galinka (&#x27;Galja&#x27;) (1910–1979) became an author and illustrator of children&#x27;s books; Paul, Jr. (&#x27;Pavlik&#x27;) (1915–1939) became a physicist; and Vassily (&#x27;Wassik&#x27;) (1918–1933).

The Ehrenfests returned to Göttingen in September 1906. They did not see Boltzmann again: on 5 September Boltzmann took his own life in Duino near Trieste. Ehrenfest published an extensive obituary describing Boltzmann&#x27;s accomplishments. Felix Klein, dean of the Göttingen mathematicians and chief editor of the &quot;Enzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften&quot; (&quot;Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences&quot;), had counted on Boltzmann for a review about statistical mechanics. Now he asked Ehrenfest to take on this task. Together with his wife, Ehrenfest worked on it for several years; the article was not published until 1911. It is a review of the work of Boltzmann and his school, and has a style all its own: a sharp logical analysis of the fundamental hypotheses, clear delineation of unsolved questions, and an explanation of general principles by cleverly chosen transparent examples.

In 1907, the couple relocated to St. Petersburg. Ehrenfest found good friends there, in particular the physicist A.F. Joffe, but felt scientifically isolated. Moreover, because he was unwilling to declare belief in any religious denomination, he could not apply for a professorship and therefore had no prospect of securing a permanent position. In 1912, Ehrenfest toured German-speaking universities in the hope of a position. He visited Berlin, where he saw Max Planck; Leipzig, where he met his old friend German mathematician Gustav Herglotz; Munich, where he met theoretical physicist Arnold Sommerfeld; Zürich; and Vienna. In Prague he met Albert Einstein for the first time, and they remained close friends thereafter. Einstein recommended that Ehrenfest succeed him in his position in Prague, but the plan failed since Ehrenfest declared himself an atheist. Sommerfeld offered him a position in Munich, but Ehrenfest received a better offer; at the same time there was an unexpected turn of events: H. A. Lorentz resigned his position at the University of Leiden, and on his advice, Ehrenfest was appointed as his successor.

=== Academic career ===
In October 1912, Ehrenfest arrived in Leiden, and on 4 December, he gave his inaugural lecture, &quot;Zur Krise der Lichtaether-Hypothese&quot; (About the crisis of the light-ether hypothesis). He remained in Leiden for the rest of his career. To stimulate interaction and exchange among physics students, Ehrenfest organized a discussion group and a study association called &quot;De Leidsche Flesch&quot; (&quot;The Leyden jar&quot;). He maintained close contact with prominent physicists in the country and abroad, and invited them to visit Leiden and give presentations in his lecture series. Ehrenfest was an outstanding debater, quick to point out weaknesses and summarize the essentials. 
 
In his lectures, Ehrenfest emphasized simple models and examples to illustrate and clarify basic assumptions. His classes were small, and he made an effort to get to know students who made use of the reading room. Though few of them were accepted as majors in theoretical physics, he had long discussions with them almost daily. According to Einstein:
He was not merely the best teacher in our profession whom I have ever known; he was also passionately preoccupied with the development and destiny of men, especially his students. To understand others, to gain their friendship and trust, to aid anyone embroiled in outer or inner struggles, to encourage youthful talent—all this was his real element, almost more than his immersion in scientific problems.
If Ehrenfest felt there was little more he could teach a student, he would send them to other centers in Europe for more training. He would also encourage students to accept positions abroad. Among his students were Johannes Burgers, Hendrik Kramers, Dirk Coster, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit, who became famous for jointly proposing the concept of electron spin, Jan Tinbergen, Arend Rutgers, Hendrik Casimir, Gerhard Dieke, Dirk Struik, and Gerard Kuiper. His assistants included Yuri Krutkov, Viktor Trkal, Adriaan Fokker, Paul Epstein, and Gregory Breit. Other young foreign scientists who spent extended periods in his laboratory included Gunnar Nordström, Enrico Fermi, Igor Tamm, Oskar Klein, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Walter Elsasser, Ralph Kronig, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac, and David Dennison.

Ehrenfest had ambivalent opinions about science, technological progress, and cultural and social issues.

In 1919, he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

===Final years===
Going by his correspondence with his friends, it seems that Ehrenfest suffered from severe depression at latest by May 1931. By August 1932, Einstein was so worried that he wrote to the Board of the University of Leiden, expressing concern and suggesting ways in which Ehrenfest&#x27;s workload could be reduced.

Having made arrangements for the care of his other children, on 25 September 1933, in Amsterdam, Ehrenfest fatally shot his younger son Wassik, who had Down syndrome, then killed himself.

== Research ==
Most of Ehrenfest&#x27;s scientific papers deal primarily with fundamentals, and seek to clarify single sub-topics. His publications are renowned for their lucidity and directness, and for solving paradoxes by providing clearer descriptions. His method is best illustrated by what he wrote to Robert Oppenheimer in the summer of 1928, after Oppenheimer invited himself for an extended stay in Leiden:
If you intend to mount heavy mathematical artillery again during your coming year in Europe, I would ask you not only not to come to Leiden, but if possible not even to Holland, and just because I am really so fond of you and want to keep it that way. But if, on the contrary, you want to spend at least your first few months patiently, comfortably, and joyfully in discussions that keep coming back to the same few points, chatting about a few basic questions with me and our young people—and without thinking much about publishing (!!!)—why then I welcome you with open arms!!
Characteristically, he did not like the abstraction of the new quantum theory of Heisenberg and Dirac.

Ehrenfest&#x27;s most important contribution from 1912 to 1933 is the theory of adiabatic invariants. It is a concept derived from classical mechanics that can serve to refine certain methods of Niels Bohr&#x27;s model of the atom (although initially Ehrenfest did not accept Bohr&#x27;s ideas), and also creates an association between atomic mechanics and statistical mechanics. He made major contributions to quantum physics, including the theory of phase transitions and the Ehrenfest theorem, which states that expectation values of a quantum system conform to classical mechanics. His name is also given to the Ehrenfest paradox, an apparent paradox of relativity still discussed, to the Ehrenfest model, and to Ehrenfest time, the time characterizing the difference of quantum dynamics for observables from classical dynamics.

Ehrenfest was also interested in developing mathematical theories for economics. This interest was stimulated by his notion that there should be an analogy between thermodynamics and economic processes. While this did not result in publications, he did encourage his graduate student Jan Tinbergen to research this. Tinbergen&#x27;s thesis was devoted to problems from both physics and economics, and he later became an economist and was awarded the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969.

== Einstein and Bohr in Leiden ==
Ehrenfest was particularly close to both Einstein and Bohr. After Niels Bohr&#x27;s first visit to Leiden in 1919, for Hans Kramers&#x27; thesis defense, he wrote to Ehrenfest:
I am sitting and thinking of all what you have told me about so very many different things, and whatever I think of I feel that I have learned so much from you which will be of great importance for me; but, at the same time, I wish so much to express my feeling of happiness over your friendship and of thankfulness for the confidence and sympathy you have shown me, I find myself so utterly incapable of finding words for it.
On his invitation Einstein accepted in 1920 an appointment as extraordinary professor at the University of Leiden. This arrangement allowed Einstein to visit Leiden for a few weeks every year. At these occasions Einstein would stay at Ehrenfest&#x27;s home. In 1923 Einstein stayed there for six weeks, after German ultra-nationalists in Berlin had made threats against his life.
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Lorentz&#x27; doctorate (December 1925) Ehrenfest invited both Bohr and Einstein over to Leiden, in an attempt to reconcile their scientific differences about the emerging quantum theory. These discussions were continued at the 1927 Solvay Conference, where Ehrenfest much to his dismay preferred Bohr&#x27;s argument in this great debate.

==Quotes==
Ehrenfest used colourful German language in his physics lectures:

Das ist der springende Punkt (translation: That is the crucial point)&lt;br&gt;
Das ist wo der Frosch ins Wasser springt (That is where the frog jumps into the water)&lt;br&gt;
Das ist der Patentanspruch (That is the patent claim, the essence)&lt;br&gt;
Da hat Herr ... schliesslich die Ratte aus der Suppe gezogen (There Mr. X finally pulled the rat out of the soup) [ when a scientist had solved a messy problem]&lt;br&gt;
Je besser man&#x27;s versteht um so besser steht es dort (The better one understands, the better it is written there, [Ehrenfest&#x27;s comment when Dirac was asked in writing for an explanation of his work, and Dirac characteristically simply reproduced exactly his previous explanation.]
==Legacy==
The monthly evening colloquium in physics at Leiden University Ehrenfest initiated in 1912 at his house continues with the name &quot;Colloquium Ehrenfestii&quot;.

<text>Eileithyia or Ilithyia (; ; (&quot;Eleuthyia&quot;) in Crete, also (&quot;Eleuthia&quot;) or (&quot;Elysia&quot;) in Laconia and Messene, and (&quot;Eleuthō&quot;) in literature) was the Greek goddess of childbirth and midwifery, and the daughter of Zeus and Hera. In the cave of Amnisos (Crete) she was related with the annual birth of the divine child, and her cult is connected with &quot;Enesidaon&quot; (the earth shaker), who was the chthonic aspect of the god Poseidon. It is possible that her cult is related with the cult of Eleusis. In his &quot;Seventh Nemean Ode&quot;, Pindar refers to her as the maid to or seated beside the Moirai (Fates) and responsible for the creation of offspring. Her son was Sosipolis, who was worshiped at Elis.

==Etymology==
The earliest form of the name is the Mycenaean Greek , &quot;e-re-u-ti-ja&quot;, written in the Linear B syllabic script. Ilithyia is the latinisation of &quot;&quot;.

The etymology of the name is uncertain, but debated among scholars. R. S. P. Beekes suggests a non-Indo-European etymology, and Nilsson believed that the name is Pre-Greek. 19th-century scholars suggested that the name is Greek, derived from the verb &quot;eleutho&quot; &quot;()&quot;, &quot;to bring&quot;, the goddess thus meaning &quot;The Bringer&quot;. Walter Burkert believed that &quot;Eileithyia&quot; is the Greek goddess of birth and that her name is pure Greek. However, the relation with the Greek prefix &#x27; is uncertain, because the prefix appears in some pre-Greek toponyms like &#x27; (Eleutherna); therefore it is possible that the name is pre-Greek. Her name &quot;&quot; (&quot;Elysia&quot;) in Laconia and Messene probably relates her with the month &quot;Eleusinios&quot; and Eleusis. Nilsson also believed that the name &quot;Eleusis&quot; is pre-Greek.

==Origins==
According to F. Willets, the goddess shows a clear connection to a preexisting Minoan goddess, as well as an earlier Neolithic concept. Eileithyia&#x27;s guidance in childbirth may give influence of the first midwife. To Homer, she is &quot;the goddess of childbirth&quot;. The &quot;Iliad&quot; pictures Eileithyia alone, or sometimes multiplied, as the Eileithyiai:

Hesiod (c. 700 BC) described Eileithyia as a daughter of Hera by Zeus (&quot;Theogony&quot; 921)—and the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; (Roman-era) and Diodorus Siculus (c. 90–27 BC) (5.72.5) agreed. Also, a poem at the Greek Anthology Book 6, mention Eileithyia as Hera&#x27;s daughter. But Pausanias, writing in the 2nd century AD, reported another early source (now lost): &quot;The Lycian Olen, an earlier poet, who composed for the Delians, among other hymns, one to Eileithyia, styles her as &#x27;the clever spinner&#x27;, clearly identifying her with the Fates, thus making her older than Cronus.&quot; Being the youngest born to Gaia, Cronus was a Titan of the first generation and he was identified as the father of Zeus. Likewise, the meticulously accurate mythographer Pindar (522–443 BC) also makes no mention of Zeus:

Later, for the Classical Greeks, &quot;She is closely associated with Artemis and Hera,&quot; Burkert asserts, &quot;but develops no character of her own&quot;. In the &quot;Orphic Hymn&quot; to Prothyraia, virginal Artemis is given an epithet relating to the goddess of childbirth, making the divine huntress also &quot;she who comes to the aid of women in childbirth&quot;:

Eileithyia is commonly in classical Greek art most often depicted assisting childbirth. Vase-painters, when illustrating the birth of Athena from Zeus&#x27; head, may show two assisting Eileithyiai, with their hands raised in the epiphany gesture. The Beauty of Durrës, a large 4th-century B.C.E. mosaic shows the head figure of a woman, probably portrays the goddess Eileithyia. A fragment by Callimachus has Eileithyia assist her full-sister Hebe in her labour, presumably when she gave birth to Alexiares and Anicetus, her sons by Heracles.

==Cult==

As the primary goddess of childbirth along with Artemis, Eileithyia had numerous shrines in many locations in Greece dating from Neolithic to Roman times, indicating that she was extremely important to pregnant women and their families. People would pray for and leave offerings for aid in fertility, safe childbirth, or give appreciation for a successful birth. Archaeological evidence of terracotta votive figurines depict children found at shrines, and holy sites dedicated to Eileithyia suggest that she was a kourotrophic divinity, whom parents would have prayed to for protection and care of their children. Midwives had an essential role in ancient Greek society, with women of all classes participating in the profession - many being slaves with only empirical training or some theoretical training in obstetrics and gynecology. More highly educated midwives, typically from higher classes, were referred to as or doctors of women&#x27;s diseases and would be respected as physicians.

She was invoked by women in labour, to ease the pain of labour, and to further the birth. Callimachus recorded the hymn:

She was strongly connected with the goddesses Artemis and Hekate, sharing with the latter strong chthonic elements in her cult.

===Achaea===
Pausanias described a sanctuary to the goddess in the city of Aigion, and the cult associated with it: &quot;At Aigion [in Akhaia] is an ancient sanctuary of Eileithyia, and her image is covered from head to foot with finely-woven drapery; it is of wood except the face, hands and feet, which are made of Pentelic marble. One hand is stretched out straight; the other holds up a torch. One might conjecture that torches are an attribute of Eileithyia because the pangs of women are just like fire. The torches might also be explained by the fact that it is Eileithyia who brings children to the light.&quot;

Aside from the sanctuary in the city of Aigion, Pausanias also noted that there were temples to the goddess in the towns of Boura and Pellene in Achaea.

===Arcadia ===
Pausanias described two sanctuaries to the goddess in Arcadia, one in the town of Kleitor and the other one in Tegea. In Kleitor, she was worshipped as one of the most important deities, along with Demeter and Asklepios, and her sanctuary the most important one alongside the other two.

=== Argos ===
Offerings were often given to the goddess Eileithyia within the ten days following a child&#x27;s birth Pausanias describes a sanctuary to her in the city of Argos, and the myth associated with it: &quot;Near the Lords [sanctuary of the Dioskouroi at Argos] is a sanctuary of Eilethyia, dedicated by Helene when, Theseus having gone away with Peirithous to Thesprotia, Aphidna had been captured by the Dioskouroi and Helen was being brought to Lakedaimon. For it is said that she was with child, was delivered in Argos, and founded the sanctuary of Eilethyia, giving the daughter she bore to Klytaimnestra, who was already wedded to Agamemnon.&quot; Pausanias noted a shrine to her in Mycenae, and an important shrine in Mases in Argolis: &quot;[At Mases, Argos] there is a sanctuary of Eileithyia within the wall. Every day, both with sacrifices and with incense, they magnificently propitiate the goddess, and, moreover, there is a vast number of votive gifts offered to Eileithyia. But the image no one may see, except, perhaps, the priestesses.&quot;

=== Athens ===
There were ancient icons of Eileithyia at Athens, one said to have been brought from Crete, according to Pausanias, who mentioned shrines to Eileithyia in Tegea and Argos, with an extremely important shrine in Aigion. Eileithyia, along with Artemis and Persephone, is often shown carrying torches to bring children out of darkness and into light: in Roman mythology her counterpart in easing labor is Lucina (&quot;of the light&quot;).

Pausanias noted: 

===Corinth===
Pausanias noted a sanctuary in Corinth: &quot;When you have turned from the Akrokorinthos [at Korinthos] into the mountain road you see the Teneatic gate and a sanctuary of Eileithyia.&quot;

=== Crete ===
The Cave of Eileithyia near Amnisos, the harbor of Knossos, mentioned in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (xix.189) in connection with her cult, was accounted the birthplace of Eileithyia. In the river nearby also named Amnisos, lived nymphs that were sacred to Eileithyia named Amnisades and Amnisabes. The Cretan cave has stalactites suggestive of the goddess&#x27; double form (Kerenyi 1976 fig. 6), of bringing labor on and of delaying it, and votive offerings to her have been found establishing the continuity of her cult from Neolithic times, with a revival as late as the Roman period. Here she was probably being worshipped before Zeus arrived in the Aegean, but certainly in Minoan–Mycenaean times. The goddess is mentioned as Eleuthia in a Linear B fragment from Knossos, where it is stated that her temple is given an amphora of honey. In the cave of Amnisos (Crete) the god Enesidaon (the &quot;earth shaker&quot;, who is the chthonic Poseidon) is related to the cult of Eileithyia. She was related with the annual birth of the divine child. The goddess of nature and her companion survived in the Eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered: &quot;Mighty Potnia bore a strong son.&quot;

In classical times, there were shrines to Eileithyia in the Cretan cities of Lato and Eleutherna and a sacred cave at Inatos. At a sanctuary in Tsoutsouros Inatos, two small terracotta figures, one breastfeeding and the other pregnant, have been dated to the 7th century.

=== Delos ===
According to the Homeric Hymn III to Delian Apollo, Hera detained Eileithyia, who was coming from the Hyperboreans in the far north, to prevent Leto from going into labor with Artemis and Apollo, since the father was her husband Zeus. Hera was jealous of Zeus&#x27;s affairs and tended to enact revenge upon the women. The other goddesses present at the birthing on Delos had sent Iris to bring Eileithyia forth. As she stepped upon the island, the birth began. This hymn is contradicted by Hesiod&#x27;s Theogony, where Apollo and Artemis are born before Hera&#x27;s marriage to Zeus, and therefore neither Hera or Eileithyia are mentioned interfering with the birth of the twins. On Delos, a shrine was dedicated to Eileithyia, and was worshipped in a mid-winter festival the named &quot;Eileithyaea&quot;. It was said by Callimachus that the hymn sung during festival was the same as that sung by nymphs at Apollo&#x27;s birth. This cult likely goes back to the Archaic period, and the cult was associated with other local Delian childbirth deities associated with Artemis, Upis and Arge.

===Eretriam===
Archaeologists uncovered a sanctuary dedicated to Eileithyia at Eretria. The sanctuary had been placed in the northwestern section of a gymnasium.

===Messene===
Pausanias noted that &quot;The Messenians have a temple erected to Eileithyia [at Messene, Messenia] with a stone statue.&quot;

===Olympia===
On the Greek mainland, at Olympia, an archaic shrine with an inner cella sacred to the serpent-savior of the city (Sosipolis) and to Eileithyia was seen by the traveler Pausanias in the 2nd century AD (&quot;Description of Greece&quot; vi.20.1–3); in it, a virgin-priestess cared for a serpent that was fed on honeyed barley-cakes and water—an offering suited to Demeter. The shrine memorialized the appearance of a crone with a babe in arms, at a crucial moment when Elians were threatened by forces from Arcadia. The child, placed on the ground between the contending forces, changed into a serpent, driving the Arcadians away in flight, before it disappeared into the hill.

=== Paros ===
Eileithyia had a cult south of the Mount Kounados on the Cycladic Island of Paros, where a cave with a natural spring functioned as an informal sanctuary. Numerous artifacts have been found, such as pottery, bronze pieces, and marble plaques, which indicate use of the site from the Geometric period to the Roman period. It has been theorized that the site was used for prayers for both female and male fertility, based on the type of offerings that have been found.

=== Sparta ===
There was a sanctuary dedicated to Eileithyia near the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia, which Pausanias noted: &quot;Not far from Orthia [the temple of Artemis in Sparta, Lakedaimon] is a sanctuary of Eileithyia. They say that they built it, and came to worship Eileithyia as a goddess, because of an oracle from Delphoi.&quot;

=== Syria ===
Lucian, in On the Syrian Goddess said that there was a statue of Eilithyia in the temple of Hierapolis Bambyce, at Manbij, in Syria.

<text>Quintin Hogg (14 February 1845 – 17 January 1903) was an English philanthropist, remembered primarily as a benefactor of the Royal Polytechnic institution at Regent Street, London, now the University of Westminster.

==Early life==
Hogg, the seventh son of Sir James Hogg, 1st Baronet, was born and spent most of his life in London. He was educated at Eton College, where he was known as &quot;Piggy Hogg&quot;. Hogg was a keen and accomplished sportsman, and along with other Etonians he was a pioneer of Association Football. Whilst at Eton, he won the Eton Fives, was keeper of fives and in the shooting XI, and was a member of the Wall and Field football XIs. He showed strong religious convictions and held prayer meetings; he was also a prominent rifle volunteer.

He made 31 appearances for Wanderers F.C. (winners of the first F.A. Cup) between the 1865–66 and the 1870–71 seasons. He twice represented Scotland versus England in the unofficial internationals of 1870 and 1871. He captained the Old Etonians for seven years, during which he was never on the losing side.

He became involved in trade, particularly the commodities of tea and sugar. As a senior partner in a firm of tea merchants, he modernised sugar production in Demerara at the plantation of his brother-in-law, the former slave owner Charles McGarel. While in Demerara he played two first-class cricket matches for the colony.

==Educational reform==

Having made his fortune, he became concerned with Christian-motivated philanthropy. 
Much of London and its population at the time suffered from extremely deprived social conditions. Hogg turned his energy to educational reform: in 1864 he founded York Place Ragged School. With Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird (1847–1923, later 11th Baron Kinnaird) and Thomas Henry William Pelham (1847–1916), he rented rooms in York Place (formerly Alley), off The Strand in central London, for a boys&#x27; school, initially a day school, later open in the evenings. 
In 1882, he founded the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Institute, which was renamed the Regent Street Polytechnic (incorporating the Royal Polytechnic Institution). 
The polytechnic was later part of Polytechnic of Central London (PCL) and is now the University of Westminster. 
It is the largest provider of adult education in London, and its headquarters are still at the same location on Regent Street.
==Other==
Hogg was an alderman of the first London County Council, encouraging the founding of other polytechnics, then called working men&#x27;s (or mechanics&#x27;) institutes. For example, in 1886, he was consulted by Frank Didden about establishing a polytechnic in Woolwich (Hogg had founded a ragged school in Castle Street, Woolwich); Woolwich Polytechnic, England&#x27;s second polytechnic, eventually opened in 1891.

==Personal life==
He married Alice Anna Graham, daughter of William Graham, on 16 May 1871, in the St George Hanover Square parish. They had three sons and two daughters:

* Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham (1872–1950), the father of Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone (1907–2001)
* Elsie Florence Hogg (1873–?), married Vincent Robertson Hoare (1873–1915)
*Ian Graham Hogg (1875–1914), lieutenant colonel, died September 1914 of wounds.
* Ethel Mary Hogg (1876–1970), married Herbert Frederick Wood. She wrote a biography of her father, as Ethel M. Wood;
* Malcolm Nicholson Hogg (1883–1948) 

Hogg died in the bath while staying at the Polytechnic in 1903. An inquest found death was due to asphyxiation from an inadequately ventilated gas heater. His funeral took place at All Souls, Langham Place, followed by cremation. His ashes were buried at the East Finchley Cemetery.

His wealth at death was valued for probate at £161,253 8s. 9d (around £17m at 2018 prices).

<doc id="78965" wikidata="Q536598" url="?curid=78965" title="Klazomenai">
<text>Klazomenai () or Clazomenae was one of the 12 cities of ancient Ionia (the others being Chios, Samos, Phocaea, Erythrae, Teos, Lebedus, Colophon, Ephesus, Priene, Myus, and Miletus). It is located at the south coast of Smyrna Gulf, Ionia, and a member of the Ionian League. It was one of the first cities to issue silver coinage. Its ruins are now located in the modern town Urla near İzmir in İzmir Province, Turkey.

==Location==
Klazomenai is located in modern Urla (Vourla (Βουρλά) in Greek) on the western coast of Anatolia, on the southern coast of the Gulf of İzmir, at about west of İzmir. The city was originally located on the mainland at Limantepe, but probably during the early fifth-century BC Ionian Revolt from the Persians, it was moved to the Karantina Island just off the coast. Soon after that, the city of Chyton was founded on the mainland the late fifth-century BC. Both cities had conflictual relations but Alexander the Great eventually connected Karantina island to the mainland with a causeway, the remains of which are still visible.

==Mythology==
A silver coin minted in Klazomenai shows the head of Apollo, the principal god of the city. According to myth, swans drew the chariot in which Apollo every year flew south from his winter home in the land of the Hyperboreans. But Klazomenai was also home to large numbers of swans, and it is thought that the verb &quot;klazo&quot; was used to describe the call of the wild birds. The swan on the obverse is both an attribute of Apollo and a pun on the name Klazomenai.

==Ancient times==
Though not in existence before the arrival of the Ionians in Asia, its original founders were largely settlers from Phlius and Cleonae. It stood originally near Limantepe; but the inhabitants, alarmed by the encroachments of the Persians, moved to the Karantina island of the bay, and established their city there.

Clazomenae was attacked by the Lydian king Alyattes in the 6th century. During the 5th century it was for some time subject to the Athenians, but about the middle of the Peloponnesian War (412 BC) it revolted. After a brief resistance, however, it again acknowledged the Athenian supremacy, and repelled a Lacedaemonian attack. In 387 BC Klazomenai and other cities in Asia were taken over by Persia, but the city continued to issue its own coins.

The philosopher Anaxagoras (c. 510 – 428 BC), often styled &quot;Anaxagoras of Clazomenae&quot;, was born in Clazomenae, as was the earlier philosopher Hermotimus of Clazomenae.

Herodotos of Klazomenai was the first Clazomenian Olympic winner, his victory being in the boys foot-race. The Clazomenians dedicated a statue of him at Olympia, Greece.

Scopelian or Skopelianos of Clazomenae (Σκοπελιανός), was an ancient Greek sophist.

Under the Romans, Clazomenae was included in the province of Asia, and enjoyed an immunity from taxation.

Clazomenae became a Christian bishopric early. Its bishop, Eusebius took part in the Council of Ephesus in 431 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Another, Macarius, participated in the Council of Constantinople (869), which is seen within the Catholic Church as the eighth ecumenical council. Although still documented at the end of the 14th century, it is no longer a residential bishopric. Accordingly, Clazomenae is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

==Archaeology==
The site of Liman Tepe, which lies near an old harbour contains very important Bronze Age excavations, the most prominent and remarkable of which is the amount of varying archaic burial sites, as well as evidence of the practises associated with them close by. One possible explanation for this is that these sites were used by different social groups within society.

The city was famous for production and exports of olive oil and its painted terracotta Klazomenian sarcophagi, which are the finest monuments of Ionian painting in the 6th century BC.

A large painted terracotta sarcophagus and lid, together weighing about 2 tonnes, were discovered in the vicinity of Klazomenai in the late nineteenth century. An ancient Greek work dating to about 500 BC, the funerary objects depict war scenes, chariot racing, hunting as well as geometric patterns throughout and is now in the British Museum&#x27;s collection.

It was also prized for its variety of garum.

==Ancient olive press==

Olive oil extraction installation (&quot;işlik&quot;) dating back to the third quarter of the 6th century BC uncovered in Klazomenai is the only surviving example of a level and weights press from an ancient Greek city and precedes by at least two centuries the next securely datable earliest presses found in Greece. It was restored and reconstructed in 2004–2005 through collaboration between Ege University, a Turkish olive-oil exporter and a German natural building components company, as well as by local artisans, on the basis of the clearly visible millstone with a cylindrical roller and three separation pits. The olive oil obtained turned out to be quite a success in business terms as well. The reconstructed olive oil press is located on the original mainland site of Klazomenai, at .

==Financial pioneers==
In an event noted by Aristotle, Klazomenians also appear as financial pioneers in economic history, for having used one commodity (&quot;olive oil&quot;), in an organized manner and on a city-scale, to purchase another (&quot;wheat&quot;), with interests refundable on the value of the first. Around 350 B.C., suffering from a shortage of grain and scarcity of funds, the rulers of the city passed a resolution calling on citizens who had stores of olive oil to lend to the city at interest. The loan arranged, they hired vessels and sent them to ports of exportation of grain and bought a consignment on the pledged security of the value of the oil.

<text>The Indo-Aryan languages, or sometimes Indic languages, are a branch of the Indo-Iranian languages in the Indo-European language family. As of 2024, there are more than 1.5 billion speakers, primarily concentrated east of the Indus river in Bangladesh, North India, Eastern Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Nepal. Moreover, apart from the Indian subcontinent, large immigrant and expatriate Indo-Aryan–speaking communities live in Northwestern Europe, Western Asia, North America, the Caribbean, Southeast Africa, Polynesia and Australia, along with several million speakers of Romani languages primarily concentrated in Southeastern Europe. There are over 200 known Indo-Aryan languages.

Modern Indo-Aryan languages descend from Old Indo-Aryan languages such as early Vedic Sanskrit, through Middle Indo-Aryan languages (or Prakrits). The largest such languages in terms of first-speakers are Hindi–Urdu (), Bengali (242 million), Punjabi (about 150 million), Marathi (112 million), and Gujarati (60 million). A 2005 estimate placed the total number of native speakers of the Indo-Aryan languages at nearly 900 million people. Other estimates are higher, suggesting a figure of 1.5 billion speakers of Indo-Aryan languages.

== Classification ==
=== Theories ===

The Indo-Aryan family as a whole is thought to represent a dialect continuum, where languages are often transitional towards neighboring varieties. Because of this, the division into languages vs. dialects is in many cases somewhat arbitrary. The classification of the Indo-Aryan languages is controversial, with many transitional areas that are assigned to different branches depending on classification. There are concerns that a tree model is insufficient for explaining the development of New Indo-Aryan, with some scholars suggesting the wave model.

==== Subgroups ====
The following table of proposals is expanded from (from Hoernlé to Turner), and also includes subsequent classification proposals. The table lists only some modern Indo-Aryan languages.

Anton I. Kogan, in 2016, conducted a lexicostatistical study of the New Indo-Aryan languages based on a 100-word Swadesh list, using techniques developed by the glottochronologist and comparative linguist Sergei Starostin. That grouping system is notable for Kogan&#x27;s exclusion of Dardic from Indo-Aryan on the basis of his previous studies showing low lexical similarity to Indo-Aryan (43.5%) and negligible difference with similarity to Iranian (39.3%). He also calculated Sinhala–Dhivehi to be the most divergent Indo-Aryan branch. Nevertheless, the modern consensus of Indo-Aryan linguists tends towards the inclusion of Dardic based on morphological and grammatical features.

==== Inner–Outer hypothesis ====

The Inner–Outer hypothesis argues for a core and periphery of Indo-Aryan languages, with Outer Indo-Aryan (generally including Eastern and Southern Indo-Aryan, and sometimes Northwestern Indo-Aryan, Dardic and Pahari) representing an older stratum of Old Indo-Aryan that has been mixed to varying degrees with the newer stratum that is Inner Indo-Aryan. It is a contentious proposal with a long history, with varying degrees of claimed phonological and morphological evidence. Since its proposal by Rudolf Hoernlé in 1880 and refinement by George Grierson it has undergone numerous revisions and a great deal of debate, with the most recent iteration by Franklin Southworth and Claus Peter Zoller based on robust linguistic evidence (particularly an Outer past tense in &quot;-l-&quot;). Some of the theory&#x27;s skeptics include Suniti Kumar Chatterji and Colin P. Masica.

=== Groups ===
The below classification follows , and .

==== Dardic ====

The Dardic languages (also Dardu or Pisaca) are a group of Indo-Aryan languages largely spoken in the northwestern extremities of the Indian subcontinent. Dardic was first formulated by George Abraham Grierson in his Linguistic Survey of India but he did not consider it to be a subfamily of Indo-Aryan. The Dardic group as a genetic grouping (rather than areal) has been scrutinised and questioned to a degree by recent scholarship: Southworth, for example, says &quot;the viability of Dardic as a genuine subgroup of Indo-Aryan is doubtful&quot; and &quot;the similarities among [Dardic languages] may result from subsequent convergence&quot;.

The Dardic languages are thought to be transitional with Punjabi and Pahari (e.g. Zoller describes Kashmiri as &quot;an interlink between Dardic and West Pahāṛī&quot;), as well as non-Indo-Aryan Nuristani; and are renowned for their relatively conservative features in the context of Proto-Indo-Aryan.

* Kashmiri: Kashmiri, Kishtwari, Poguli;
* Shina: Brokskad, Kundal Shahi, Shina, Ushojo, Kalkoti, Palula, Savi;
* Chitrali: Kalasha, Khowar;
* Kohistani: Bateri, Chilisso, Gowro, Indus Kohistani, Kalami, Tirahi, Torwali, Wotapuri-Katarqalai;
* Pashayi
* Kunar: Dameli, Gawar-Bati, Nangalami, Shumashti.

==== Northern Zone ====
The Northern Indo-Aryan languages, also known as the Pahari (&#x27;hill&#x27;) languages, are spoken throughout the Himalayan regions of the subcontinent.

* Eastern Pahari: Nepali, Jumli, Doteli;
* Central Pahari: Garhwali, Kumaoni;
* Western Pahari: Dogri, Kangri, Bhadarwahi, Churahi, Bhateali, Bilaspuri, Chambeali, Gaddi, Pangwali, Mandeali, Mahasu Pahari, Jaunsari, Kullui, Pahari Kinnauri, Hinduri, Sarazi, Sirmauri.

==== Northwestern Zone ====
Northwestern Indo-Aryan languages are spoken in the northwestern region of India and eastern region of Pakistan. Punjabi is spoken predominantly in the Punjab region and is the official language of the northern Indian state of Punjab, in addition to being the most widely-spoken language in Pakistan. Sindhi and its variants are spoken natively in the Pakistani province of Sindh and neighbouring regions. Northwestern languages are ultimately thought to be descended from Shauraseni Prakrit, with influence from Persian and Arabic.

* Punjabi
** Central: Majhi
** Central-Western: Dhanni, Jhangvi, Pahari-Pothwari, Shahpuri, Thali
** Eastern: Doabi, Malwai, Puadhi
** Standard
** Western: Hindko (Kohati, Ghebi, Awankari, Chachhi, Peshawari, Hazarvi), Inku, Saraiki (Riasti, Derawali, Multani)
* Sindhi: Sindhi, Jadgali, Kutchi, Luwati, Memoni, Khetrani, Kholosi.

==== Western Zone ====
Western Indo-Aryan languages are spoken in central and western India, in states such as Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, in addition to contiguous regions in Pakistan. Gujarati is the official language of Gujarat, and is spoken by over 50 million people. In Europe, various Romani languages are spoken by the Romani people, an itinerant community who historically migrated from India. The Western Indo-Aryan languages are thought to have diverged from their northwestern counterparts, although they have a common antecedent in Shauraseni Prakrit.

*Rajasthani: Bagri, Marwari, Mewati, Dhundari, Harauti, Mewari, Shekhawati, Dhatki, Malvi, Nimadi, Gujari, Goaria, Loarki, Bhoyari/Pawari, Kanjari, Od, Lambadi;
* Gujarati: Gujarati, Jandavra, Saurashtra, Aer, Vaghri, Parkari Koli, Kachi Koli, Wadiyara Koli;
* Bhil: Kalto, Vasavi, Wagdi, Gamit, Vaagri Booli;
** Northern Bhil: Bauria, Bhilori, Magari;
** Central Bhil: Bhili proper, Bhilali, Chodri, Dhodia, Dhanki, Dubli;
** Bareli: Palya Bareli, Pauri Bareli, Rathwi Bareli, Pardhi;
* Khandeshi
* Domaaki
* Domari
* Romani: Carpathian Romani, Balkan Romani, Vlax Romani, Baltic Romani; 
** Northern Romani
*** British Romani: Angloromani, Welsh Romani
*** Northwestern Romani: Sinte Romani, Finnish Kalo

==== Zone ====

Within India, Central Indo-Aryan languages are spoken primarily in the western Gangetic plains, including Delhi and parts of the Central Highlands, where they are often transitional with neighbouring lects. Many of these languages, including Braj and Awadhi, have rich literary and poetic traditions. Urdu, a Persianised derivative of Dehlavi descended from Shauraseni Prakrit, is the official language of Pakistan and also has strong historical connections to India, where it also has been designated with official status. Hindi, a standardised and Sanskritised register of Dehlavi, is the official language of the Government of India (along with English). Together with Urdu, it is the third most-spoken language in the world.

* Western Hindi: Hindustani (including Standard Hindi and Standard Urdu), Khariboli, Braj, Haryanvi, Bundeli, Kannauji, Parya, Sansi. 
* Eastern Hindi: Bagheli, Chhattisgarhi, Surgujia, Awadhi (Fiji Hindi, Caribbean Hindustani).

==== Eastern Zone ====

The Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, also known as Magadhan languages, are spoken throughout the eastern subcontinent, including Odisha and Bihar, alongside other regions surrounding the northwestern Himalayan corridor. Bengali is the seventh most-spoken language in the world, and has a strong literary tradition; the national anthems of India and Bangladesh are written in Bengali. Assamese and Odia are the official languages of Assam and Odisha, respectively. The Eastern Indo-Aryan languages descend from Magadhan Apabhraṃśa and ultimately from Magadhi Prakrit. Eastern Indo-Aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of Munda languages, while western Indo-Aryan languages do not. It is suggested that &quot;proto-Munda&quot; languages may have once dominated the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain, and were then absorbed by Indo-Aryan languages at an early date as Indo-Aryan spread east.

* Bihari:
** Bhojpuri, Caribbean Hindustani, Fiji Hindi;
** Magahi, Khortha;
** Maithili, Angika, Bajjika, Thethi, Dehati;
** Sadanic: Nagpuri, Kurmali (Panchpargania);
** Tharu: Kochila Tharu, Rana Tharu, Kathariya Tharu, Sonha Tharu, Dangaura Tharu, Chitwania Buksa, Majhi, Musasa;
** Kumhali, Kuswaric: Danwar, Bote-Darai; 
* Halbic: Halbi, Kamar, Bhunjia, Nahari;
* Odia: Baleswari, Kataki, Ganjami, Sundargadi, Sambalpuri, Desia;
** Bodo Parja, Bhatri, Reli, Kupia;
* Bengali–Assamese
** Bengali-Gauda: Bengali (Bangali, Rarhi, Varendri, Sundarbani, Manbhumi, Dhakaiya Kutti, Dobhashi), Sylheti, Noakhailla, Chittagonian, Bishnupriya Manipuri, Hajong, Chakma, Tanchangya, Rohingya;
** Kamarupic: Assamese (Kamrupi, Goalpariya), Rangpuri, Surjapuri, Rajbanshi;

==== Southern Zone ====
Marathi-Konkani languages are ultimately descended from Maharashtri Prakrit, whereas Insular Indo-Aryan languages are descended from Elu Prakrit and possess several characteristics that markedly distinguish them from most of their mainland Indo-Aryan counterparts. Insular Indo-Aryan languages (of Sri Lanka and Maldives) started developing independently and diverging from the continental Indo-Aryan languages from around 5th century BCE.

* Marathi-Konkani
** Marathic: Marathi, Varhadi, Andh, Agri, Zadi Boli, Thanjavur, Berar-Deccan Marathi, Phudagi, Judeo, Katkari, Varli, Kadodi;
** Konkanic: Konkani, Canarese Konkani, Maharashtrian Konkani.
* Insular Indo-Aryan
** Sinhala: Vedda
** Maldivian: Dhivehi

==== Unclassified ====
The following languages are otherwise unclassified within Indo-Aryan:

* Chinali–Lahul Lohar: Chinali, Lahul Lohar.
* Badeshi

Dates indicate only a rough time frame.
* Proto-Indo-Aryan (before 1500 BCE, reconstructed)
* Old Indo-Aryan (–300 BCE)
** early Old Indo-Aryan: includes Vedic Sanskrit ( to 500 BCE)
** late Old Indo-Aryan: Epic Sanskrit, Classical Sanskrit ( to 1300 CE)

** late Middle Indo-Aryan: e.g. Abahattha ( to 1500 CE)
* Early Modern Indo-Aryan (Late Medieval India): e.g. early Dakhini and emergence of the Dehlavi dialect
==== Proto-Indo-Aryan ====
Proto-Indo-Aryan (or sometimes Proto-Indic) is the reconstructed proto-language of the Indo-Aryan languages. It is intended to reconstruct the language of the pre-Vedic Indo-Aryans. Proto-Indo-Aryan is meant to be the predecessor of Old Indo-Aryan (1500–300 BCE), which is directly attested as Vedic and Mitanni-Aryan. Despite the great archaicity of Vedic, however, the other Indo-Aryan languages preserve a small number of conservative features lost in Vedic.

==== Mitanni-Aryan hypothesis ====
Some theonyms, proper names, and other terminology of the Late Bronze Age Mitanni civilization of Upper Mesopotamia exhibit an Indo-Aryan superstrate. While what few written records left by the Mittani are either in Hurrian (which appears to have been the predominant language of their kingdom) or Akkadian (the main diplomatic language of the Late Bronze Age Near East), these apparently Indo-Aryan names suggest that an Indo-Aryan elite imposed itself over the Hurrians in the course of the Indo-Aryan expansion. If these traces are Indo-Aryan, they would be the earliest known direct evidence of Indo-Aryan, and would increase the precision in dating the split between the Indo-Aryan and Iranian languages (as the texts in which the apparent Indicisms occur can be dated with some accuracy).

In a treaty between the Hittites and the Mitanni, the deities Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and the Ashvins (Nasatya) are invoked. Kikkuli&#x27;s horse training text includes technical terms such as &quot;aika&quot; (cf. Sanskrit &quot;eka&quot;, &quot;one&quot;), &quot;tera&quot; (&quot;tri&quot;, &quot;three&quot;), &quot;panza&quot; (&quot;panca&quot;, &quot;five&quot;), &quot;satta&quot; (&quot;sapta&quot;, seven), &quot;na&quot; (&quot;nava&quot;, &quot;nine&quot;), &quot;vartana&quot; (&quot;vartana&quot;, &quot;turn&quot;, round in the horse race). The numeral &quot;aika&quot; &quot;one&quot; is of particular importance because it places the superstrate in the vicinity of Indo-Aryan proper as opposed to Indo-Iranian in general or early Iranian (which has &quot;aiva&quot;). Another text has &quot;babru&quot; (&quot;babhru&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;), &quot;parita&quot; (&quot;palita&quot;, &quot;grey&quot;), and (&quot;pingala&quot;, &quot;red&quot;). Their chief festival was the celebration of the solstice (&quot;vishuva&quot;) which was common in most cultures in the ancient world. The Mitanni warriors were called &quot;marya&quot;, the term for &quot;warrior&quot; in Sanskrit as well; note &quot;mišta-nnu&quot; (= &quot;miẓḍha&quot;, ≈ Sanskrit &quot;mīḍha&quot;) &quot;payment (for catching a fugitive)&quot; (M. Mayrhofer, &quot;Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen&quot;, Heidelberg, 1986–2000; Vol. II:358).

Sanskritic interpretations of Mitanni royal names render Artashumara (&quot;artaššumara&quot;) as &quot;Ṛtasmara&quot; &quot;who thinks of Ṛta&quot; (Mayrhofer II 780), Biridashva (&quot;biridašṷa, biriiašṷ&quot;a) as &quot;Prītāśva&quot; &quot;whose horse is dear&quot; (Mayrhofer II 182), Priyamazda (&quot;priiamazda&quot;) as &quot;Priyamedha&quot; &quot;whose wisdom is dear&quot; (Mayrhofer II 189, II378), Citrarata as &quot;Citraratha&quot; &quot;whose chariot is shining&quot; (Mayrhofer I 553), Indaruda/Endaruta as &quot;Indrota&quot; &quot;helped by Indra&quot; (Mayrhofer I 134), Shativaza (&quot;šattiṷaza&quot;) as &quot;Sātivāja&quot; &quot;winning the race price&quot; (Mayrhofer II 540, 696), Šubandhu as &quot;Subandhu&quot; &quot;having good relatives&quot; (a name in Palestine, Mayrhofer II 209, 735), Tushratta (&quot;tṷišeratta, tušratta&quot;, etc.) as *tṷaiašaratha, Vedic Tvastar &quot;whose chariot is vehement&quot; (Mayrhofer, Etym. Wb., I 686, I 736).

==== Old Indo-Aryan ====
The earliest evidence of the group is from Vedic Sanskrit, that is used in the ancient preserved texts of the Indian subcontinent, the foundational canon of the Hindu synthesis known as the Vedas. The Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni is of similar age to the language of the Rigveda, but the only evidence of it is a few proper names and specialized loanwords.

While Old Indo-Aryan is the earliest stage of the Indo-Aryan branch, from which all known languages of the later stages Middle and New Indo-Aryan are derived, some documented Middle Indo-Aryan variants cannot fully be derived from the documented form of Old Indo-Aryan (on which Vedic and Classical Sanskrit are based), but betray features that must go back to other undocumented dialects of Old Indo-Aryan.

From Vedic Sanskrit, &quot;Sanskrit&quot; (literally &#x27;put together, perfected, elaborated&#x27;) developed as the prestige language of culture, science and religion, as well as the court, theatre, etc. Sanskrit of the later Vedic texts is comparable to Classical Sanskrit, but is largely mutually unintelligible with Vedic Sanskrit.

==== Middle Indo-Aryan (Prakrits) ====
Outside the learned sphere of Sanskrit, vernacular dialects (Prakrits) continued to evolve. The oldest attested Prakrits are the Buddhist and Jain canonical languages Pali and Ardhamagadhi Prakrit, respectively. Inscriptions in Ashokan Prakrit were also part of this early Middle Indo-Aryan stage.

By medieval times, the Prakrits had diversified into various Middle Indo-Aryan languages. &quot;Apabhraṃśa&quot; is the conventional cover term for transitional dialects connecting late Middle Indo-Aryan with early Modern Indo-Aryan, spanning roughly the 6th to 13th centuries. Some of these dialects showed considerable literary production; the &quot;Śravakacāra&quot; of Devasena (dated to the 930s) is now considered to be the first Hindi book.

The next major milestone occurred with the Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent in the 13th–16th centuries. Under the flourishing Turco-Mongol Mughal Empire, Persian became very influential as the language of prestige of the Islamic courts due to adoption of the foreign language by the Mughal emperors.

The largest languages that formed from Apabhraṃśa were Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindustani, Assamese, Sindhi, Gujarati, Odia, Marathi, and Punjabi.

==== New Indo-Aryan ====
===== Medieval Hindustani =====
In the Central Zone Hindi-speaking areas, for a long time the prestige dialect was Braj Bhasha, but this was replaced in the 13th century by Dehlavi-based Hindustani. Hindustani was strongly influenced by Persian, with these and later Sanskrit influence leading to the emergence of Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu as registers of the Hindustani language. This state of affairs continued until the division of the British Indian Empire in 1947, when Hindi became the official language in India and Urdu became official in Pakistan. Despite the different script the fundamental grammar remains identical, the difference is more sociolinguistic than purely linguistic. Today it is widely understood/spoken as a second or third language throughout South Asia and one of the most widely known languages in the world in terms of number of speakers.

=== Outside the Indian subcontinent ===
==== Domari ====
Domari is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by older Dom people scattered across the Middle East. The language is reported to be spoken as far north as Azerbaijan and as far south as central Sudan. Based on the systematicity of sound changes, linguists have concluded that the ethnonyms &quot;Domari&quot; and &quot;Romani&quot; derive from the Indo-Aryan word &quot;ḍom&quot;.

==== Lomavren ====
Lomavren is a nearly extinct mixed language, spoken by the Lom people, that arose from language contact between a language related to Romani and Domari and the Armenian language.

==== Parya ====
Parya is spoken in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by the descendants of migrants from the Indian subcontinent. The language retains many features similar to Punjabi and the Western Hindi dialects, while also bearing some influence from Tajik Persian.

==== Romani ====
The Romani language is usually included in the Western Indo-Aryan languages. Romani varieties, which are mainly spoken throughout Europe, are noted for their relatively conservative nature; maintaining the Middle Indo-Aryan present-tense person concord markers, alongside consonantal endings for nominal case. Indeed, these features are no longer evident in most other modern Central Indo-Aryan languages. Moreover, Romani shares an innovative pattern of past-tense person, which corresponds to Dardic languages, such as Kashmiri and Shina. This is believed to be further indication that proto-Romani speakers were originally situated in central regions of the subcontinent, before migrating to northwestern regions. However, there are no known historical sources regarding the development of the Romani language specifically within India.

Research conducted by nineteenth-century scholars Pott (1845) and Miklosich (1882–1888) demonstrated that the Romani language is most aptly designated as a New Indo-Aryan language (NIA), as opposed to Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA); establishing that proto-Romani speakers could not have left India significantly earlier than AD 1000.

The principal argument favouring a migration during or after the transition period to NIA is the loss of the old system of nominal case, coupled with its reduction to a two-way nominative-oblique case system. A secondary argument concerns the system of gender differentiation, due to the fact that Romani has only two genders (masculine and feminine). Middle Indo-Aryan languages (named MIA) generally employed three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), and some modern Indo-Aryan languages retain this aspect today.

It is suggested that loss of the neuter gender did not occur until the transition to NIA. During this process, most of the neuter nouns became masculine, while several became feminine. For example, the neuter &quot;aggi&quot; &quot;fire&quot; in Prakrit morphed into the feminine &quot;āg&quot; in Hindi, and &quot;jag&quot; in Romani. The parallels in grammatical gender evolution between Romani and other NIA languages have additionally been cited as indications that the forerunner of Romani remained on the Indian subcontinent until a later period, possibly as late as the tenth century.

==== Sindhic migrations ====
Kholosi, Jadgali, and Luwati represent offshoots of the Sindhic subfamily of Indo-Aryan that have established themselves in the Persian Gulf region, perhaps through sea-based migrations. These are of a later origin than the Rom and Dom migrations which represent a different part of Indo-Aryan as well.

==== Indentured labourer migrations ====
The use by the British East India Company of indentured labourers led to the transplanting of Indo-Aryan languages around the world, leading to locally influenced lects that diverged from the source language, such as Fiji Hindi and Caribbean Hindustani.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===

==== Stop positions ====
The normative system of New Indo-Aryan stops consists of five places of articulation: labial, dental, &quot;retroflex&quot;, palatal, and velar, which is the same as that of Sanskrit. The &quot;retroflex&quot; position may involve retroflexion, or curling the tongue to make the contact with the underside of the tip, or merely retraction. The point of contact may be alveolar or postalveolar, and the distinctive quality may arise more from the shaping than from the position of the tongue. Palatal stops have affricated release and are traditionally included as involving a distinctive tongue position (blade in contact with hard palate). Widely transcribed as , claims to be a more accurate rendering.

Moving away from the normative system, some languages and dialects have alveolar affricates instead of palatal, though some among them retain in certain positions: before front vowels (esp. ), before , or when geminated. Alveolar as an &quot;additional&quot; point of articulation occurs in Marathi and Konkani where dialect mixture and others factors upset the aforementioned complementation to produce minimal environments, in some West Pahari dialects through internal developments (, &gt; ), and in Kashmiri. The addition of a retroflex affricate to this in some Dardic languages maxes out the number of stop positions at seven (barring borrowed ), while a reduction to the inventory involves *ts &gt; , which has happened in Assamese, Chittagonian, Sinhala (though there have been other sources of a secondary ), and Southern Mewari.

Further reductions in the number of stop articulations are in Assamese and Romani, which have lost the characteristic dental/retroflex contrast, and in Chittagonian, which may lose its labial and velar articulations through spirantisation in many positions (&gt; ).
 /q x ɣ f/ are restricted to Perso-Arabic loanwords in most IA languages but they occur natively in Khowar. According to Masica (1991) some dialects of Pashayi have a /θ/ which is unusual for IA languages. Domari which is spoken in the Middle East and had high contact with Middle Eastern languages has /q ħ ʕ ʔ/ and emphatic consonants from loanwords.

==== Nasals ====
Sanskrit was noted as having five nasal-stop articulations corresponding to its oral stops, and among modern languages and dialects Dogri, Kacchi, Kalasha, Rudhari, Shina, Saurashtri, and Sindhi have been analysed as having this full complement of phonemic nasals , with the last two generally as the result of the loss of the stop from a homorganic nasal + stop cluster ( &gt; and &gt; ), though there are other sources as well.

In languages that lack phonemic nasals at some places of articulation, they can still occur allophonically from place assimilation in a nasal + stop culture, e.g. Hindi &gt; .

==== Aspiration and breathy-voice ====
Most Indo-Aryan languages have contrastive aspiration (), and some retain historical breathy voice on voiced consonants (). Sometimes both phenomena are analysed as a single aspiration contrast. The places and manners of articulation which allow contrastive aspiration vary by language; e.g. Sindhi permits phonemic , but the phonemic status of this sound in Hindi is uncertain, and many &quot;Dardic&quot; languages lack aspirated retroflex sibilants despite having unaspirated equivalents.

In languages that have lost breathy-voice, the contrast has often been replaced with tone.

==== Regional developments ====
Some of these are mentioned in .

* Implosives: Languages in the Sindhic subfamily, as well as Saraiki, western Marwari dialects, and some dialects of Gujarati have developed implosive consonants from historical intervocalic geminates and word-initial stops. Sindhi has a full implosive series except for the dental implosive: . It has been claimed that Wadiyari Koli has the dental implosive too. Other languages have less complete implosive series, e.g. Kacchi has just .
* Prenasalized stops: Sinhala and Maldivian (Dhivehi) have a series of prenasalized stops covering all places except for palatal: .
* Palatalization: Kashmiri (natively) and some Romani dialects (from contact with Slavic languages) have contrastive palatalisation.
* Voiceless lateral In Gawarbati, some Pashai dialects, partly Bashkarik and some Shina dialects have /ɬ/ from clusters of tr kr or sometimes pr; dr gr and br merged with /l/ in these languages.
* Lateral affricates: Bhadarwahi has an unusual series of lateral retroflex affricates ( derived from historical clusters.

=== Vowels ===
Vowel typologies are varied across Indo-Aryan due to diachronic mergers and (in some cases) splits, as well as different accounts by linguists for even the widely-spoken languages. Vowel systems per are listed below. Many languages also have phonemic nasal vowels.

Sylheti language is one of the few tonal Indo-Aryan languages, others being Punjabi and a few Dardic languages. The vowels of Sylheti language listed below.
=== Charts ===
The following are consonant systems of major and representative New Indo-Aryan languages, mostly following , though here they are in IPA. Parentheses indicate those consonants found only in loanwords: square brackets indicate those with &quot;very low functional load&quot;. The arrangement is roughly geographical.

== Sociolinguistics ==

=== Register ===
In many Indo-Aryan languages, the literary register is often more archaic and utilises a different lexicon (Sanskrit or Perso-Arabic) than spoken vernacular. One example is Bengali&#x27;s high literary form, Sādhū bhāṣā, as opposed to the more modern Calita bhāṣā (Cholito-bhasha). This distinction approaches diglossia.

=== Language and dialect ===
In the context of South Asia, the choice between the appellations &quot;language&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot; is a difficult one, and any distinction made using these terms is obscured by their ambiguity. In one general colloquial sense, a language is a &quot;developed&quot; dialect: one that is standardised, has a written tradition and enjoys social prestige. As there are degrees of development, the boundary between a language and a dialect thus defined is not clear-cut, and there is a large middle ground where assignment is contestable.
There is a second meaning of these terms, in which the distinction is drawn on the basis of linguistic similarity. Though seemingly a &quot;proper&quot; linguistics sense of the terms, it is still problematic: methods that have been proposed for quantifying difference (for example, based on mutual intelligibility) have not been seriously applied in practice; and any relationship established in this framework is relative.

<text>In Greek mythology, Niobe (; : Nióbē) was a daughter of Tantalus and of either Dione (as most frequently cited) or of Eurythemista or Euryanassa. She was the wife of Amphion and the sister of Pelops and Broteas.

Niobe is mentioned by Achilles in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, which relates her &quot;hubris&quot;, for which she was punished by Leto, who sent Apollo and Artemis to slay all of her children, after which her children lay unburied for nine days while she abstained from food. Once the gods had interred the slain, Niobe retreated to her native Sipylus, &quot;where Nymphs dance around the River Acheloos, and though turned to stone, she broods over the sorrows sent by the Gods&quot;. Later writers asserted that Niobe was wedded to Amphion, one of the twin founders of Thebes, where there was a single sanctuary where the twin founders were venerated, but no shrine to Niobe.

== Mythology ==
=== Family ===
Her father was the ruler of a city located near Manisa in today&#x27;s Aegean Turkey that was called &quot;Tantalis&quot; or &quot;the city of Tantalus&quot;, or &quot;Sipylus&quot;. The city was located at the foot of Mount Sipylus and its ruins were reported to be still visible at the beginning of the 1st century AD, although few traces remain today. Pliny reports that Tantalis was destroyed by an earthquake and the city of Sipylus (Magnesia ad Sipylum) was built in its place.

Niobe&#x27;s father is referred to as &quot;Phrygian&quot; and sometimes even as &quot;King of Phrygia&quot;, although his city was located in the western extremity of Anatolia where Lydia was to emerge as a state before the beginning of the first millennium BC, and not in the traditional heartland of Phrygia, situated more inland. There are references to his son and Niobe&#x27;s brother as &quot;Pelops the Lydian&quot;, and this led some scholars to suspect Niobe belonged to a primordial house of Lydia.

Niobe&#x27;s husband was Amphion, a son of Zeus and Antiope. Amphion&#x27;s twin brother, Zethus, was a ruler of Thebes. Amphion became a great singer and musician after his lover Hermes taught him to play music and gave him a golden lyre. Zethus&#x27;s wife and Niobe&#x27;s sister-in-law was Aëdon, who had a single child, Itylus. Aëdon was jealous of the vast progeny Niobe had produced, so she conceived a plan to kill Niobe&#x27;s firstborn, a boy named Amaleus. Aëdon instructed her son to sleep in the back of the room, or in the innermost position of the bed that night, but Itylus forgot about his mother&#x27;s words. So when Aëdon entered the children&#x27;s chamber, she unknowingly killed her own child instead of Niobe&#x27;s. Her pain was so great the gods transformed her into a nightingale.

=== Blasphemous boast ===
Niobe boasted of her fourteen children, seven male and seven female (the Niobids), to Leto who only had two children, the twins Apollo and Artemis. The number varies in different sources. Her speech which caused the indignation of the goddess was rendered in the following manner:
Using arrows, Artemis killed Niobe&#x27;s daughters and Apollo killed Niobe&#x27;s sons. According to some versions, at least two of Niobe&#x27;s children (usually Meliboea, along with her brother Amyclas in other renderings) was spared. Their father, Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo for having sworn revenge. Devastated, Niobe fled back to Mount Sipylus and was turned into stone, and, as she wept unceasingly, waters started to pour from her petrified complexion. Mount Sipylus indeed has a natural rock formation which resembles a female face, and it has been associated with Niobe since ancient times and described by Pausanias. The rock formation is also known as the &quot;Weeping Rock&quot; (), since rainwater seeps through its porous limestone.

After Niobe&#x27;s overweening pride in her children, offending Apollo and Artemis, brought about her children&#x27;s deaths, Amphion commits suicide out of grief; according to Telesilla, Artemis and Apollo murder him along with his children. Hyginus, however, writes that in his madness he tried to attack the temple of Apollo, and was killed by the god&#x27;s arrows.

The only Niobid spared stayed greenish pale from horror for the rest of her life, and for that reason she was called Chloris (the pale one).

==Within Greek culture==
In his archaic role as bringer of diseases and death, Apollo with his poison arrows killed Niobe&#x27;s sons and Artemis with her poison arrows killed Niobe&#x27;s daughters. This is related to the myth of the seven youths and seven maidens who were sent every year to the king Minos of Crete as an offering sacrifice to the Minotaur. Niobe was transformed into a stone on Mount Sipylus in her homeland of Phrygia, where she brooded over the sorrows sent by the gods. In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone,&quot; the heroine believes that she will have a similar death.
The iconic number &quot;seven&quot; often appears in Greek legends, and represents an ancient tradition because it appears as a lyre with seven strings in the Hagia Triada sarcophagus in Crete during the Mycenean age. Apollo&#x27;s lyre had also seven strings.

==In literature and fine arts==
===Literature===

The story of Niobe, and especially her sorrows, is an ancient one. The context in which she is mentioned by Achilles to Priam in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; is as a stock type for mourning. Priam is not unlike Niobe in the sense that he was also grieving for his son Hector, who was killed and not buried for several days.

Niobe is also mentioned in Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot; where, as Antigone is marched toward her death, she compares her own loneliness to that of Niobe. Sophocles is said to have also contributed a play titled &quot;Niobe&quot; that is lost.

The &quot;Niobe&quot; of Aeschylus, set in Thebes, survives in fragmentary quotes that were supplemented by a papyrus sheet containing twenty-one lines of text. From the fragments it appears that for the first part of the tragedy the grieving Niobe sits veiled and silent.

Furthermore, the conflict between Niobe and Leto is mentioned in one of Sappho&#x27;s poetic fragments (&quot;Before they were mothers, Leto and Niobe had been the most devoted of friends.&quot;).

In Latin language sources, Niobe&#x27;s account is first told by Hyginus in his collection of stories in brief and plain &quot;Fabulae&quot;.

Parthenius of Nicaea records a rare version of the story of Niobe, in which her father is called Assaon and her husband Philottus. The circumstances in which Niobe loses her children are also different, see .

Niobe&#x27;s iconic tears were also mentioned in Hamlet&#x27;s soliloquy (Act 1, Scene 2), in which he contrasts his mother&#x27;s grief over the dead King, Hamlet&#x27;s father – &quot;like Niobe, all tears&quot; – to her unseemly hasty marriage to Claudius.

The quotation from Hamlet is also used in Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; novel &quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot;, in which an advertising agency&#x27;s client turns down an advertisement using the quotation as a caption.

In William Faulkner&#x27;s novel &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; Faulkner compares Ellen, the wife of Sutpen and father of Henry and Judith, to Niobe, &quot;this Niobe without tears, who had conceived to the demon [Sutpen] in a kind of nightmare&quot; (Chapter 1).

Among works of modern literature which have Niobe as a central theme, Kate Daniels&#x27; &quot;Niobe Poems&quot; can be cited.

===Arts===
The subject of Niobe and the destruction of the Niobids was part of the repertory of Attic vase-painters and inspired sculpture groups and wall frescoes as well as relief carvings on Roman sarcophagi.

The subject of the Attic calyx-krater from Orvieto conserved in the Musée du Louvre has provided the name for the Niobid Painter.

A lifesize group of marble Niobids, including one of Niobe sheltering one of her daughters, found in Rome in 1583 at the same time as the &quot;Wrestlers&quot;, were taken in 1775 to the Uffizi in Florence where, in a gallery devoted to them, they remain some of the most prominent surviving sculptures of Classical antiquity (&quot;see below&quot;). New instances come to light from time to time, like one headless statue found in early 2005 among the ruins of a villa in the Villa dei Quintili just outside Rome.

In painting, Niobe was painted by post-Renaissance artists from varied traditions (&quot;see below&quot;). An early appearance, &quot;The Death of Niobe&#x27;s Children&quot; by Abraham Bloemaert, was painted in 1591 towards the start of the Dutch Golden Age. The English artist Richard Wilson gained great acclaim for his &quot;The Destruction of the Children of Niobe&quot;, painted in 1760. Three notable works, all dating from the 1770s, &quot;Apollo and Diana Attacking Niobe and her Children&quot; by Anicet-Charles-Gabriel Lemonnier, &quot;The Children of Niobe Killed by Apollo and Diana&quot; by Pierre-Charles Jombert and &quot;Diana and Apollo Piercing Niobe’s Children with their Arrows&quot; by Jacques-Louis David belong to the tradition of French Baroque and Classicism.

&quot;Niobe&quot; is an abstract painting by Károly Patkó.
In classical music, Italian composer Agostino Steffani (1654–1728) dedicated his opera &quot;Niobe, Queen of Saba&quot; to her myth, and Giovanni Pacini too wrote an opera on this myth. Benjamin Britten based one of his &quot;Six Metamorphoses after Ovid&quot; on Niobe.

In modern music, Caribou called the last track on his 2007 album &quot;Andorra&quot; &quot;Niobe&quot;.

In modern dance, José Limón named a section of his dance theatre work &quot;Dances for Isadora&quot; as &quot;Niobe&quot;. The section is a solo for a woman mourning the loss of her children.

A marble statue of Niobe is a female lead character in a long-running 1892 farce Niobe (play) by Harry Paulton. In the play she is bought to life by a quaint electrical storm and brings the Edwardian values and relationships in the household to disarray. The season at the London Royal Strand Theatre enjoyed more than five hundred performances. The play is the subject of a musical dedication by Australian composer Thomas Henry Massey. The play was filmed in 1915.
===Examples in painting and sculpture===
==Related terms==
The choice of &quot;Niobe&quot; simply as a name in works of art and literature is not uncommon either. Two minor characters of Greek mythology have the same name (&quot;see Niobe (disambiguation)&quot;) and the name occurs in several works of the 19th century. More recently, one of the characters in &quot;The Matrix&quot; film series is also named Niobe. A character named Niobe also appeared in the &quot;Rome&quot; TV series.

The element niobium was so named as an extension of the inspiration which had led earlier to the naming of the element tantalum by Anders Gustaf Ekeberg. On the basis of his argument according to which there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, Heinrich Rose named them after children of Tantalus—niobium and pelopium—although the argument was later contested as far as pelopium was concerned.

A mountain in British Columbia, Canada is named Mount Niobe.

Four successive ships of the British Royal Navy were called &quot;HMS Niobe&quot;.

<text>Pixar (), doing business as Pixar Animation Studios, is an American animation studio based in Emeryville, California, known for its critically and commercially successful computer-animated feature films. Pixar is a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios, a division of Disney Entertainment, a segment of the Walt Disney Company.

Pixar started in 1979 as part of the Lucasfilm computer division. It was known as the Graphics Group before its spin-off as a corporation in 1986, with funding from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who became its majority shareholder. Disney announced its acquisition of Pixar in January 2006, and completed it in May 2006. Pixar is best known for its feature films, technologically powered by RenderMan, the company&#x27;s own implementation of the industry-standard RenderMan Interface Specification image-rendering API. The studio&#x27;s mascot is Luxo Jr., a desk lamp from the studio&#x27;s 1986 short film of the same name.

Pixar has produced 28 feature films, with its first film being &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995), which is also the first fully computer-animated feature film, and its most recent film was &quot;Inside Out 2&quot; (2024). The studio also produced many short films. , its feature films have earned over $15 billion at the worldwide box office with an average gross of $589 million per film. &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010), &quot;Finding Dory&quot; (2016), &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; (2018), &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019) and &quot;Inside Out 2&quot; all grossed over $1 billion and are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time. Moreover, 15 of Pixar&#x27;s films are in the 50 highest-grossing animated films of all time. &quot;Inside Out 2&quot; is currently the second highest-grossing animated film of all time.

Pixar has earned 23 Academy Awards, 10 Golden Globe Awards, and 11 Grammy Awards, along with numerous other awards and acknowledgments. Since its inauguration in 2001, eleven Pixar films have won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, including &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003), &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (2004), &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007), &quot;WALL-E&quot; (2008), &quot;Up&quot; (2009), the aforementioned &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, &quot;Brave&quot; (2012), &quot;Inside Out&quot; (2015), &quot;Coco&quot; (2017), and &quot;Soul&quot; (2020). &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; and &quot;Up&quot; were also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

In February 2009, Pixar executives John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, and Lee Unkrich were presented with the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement by the Venice Film Festival. The physical award was ceremoniously handed to Lucasfilm&#x27;s founder, George Lucas.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

Pixar got its start in 1974, when New York Institute of Technology&#x27;s (NYIT) founder, Alexander Schure, who was also the owner of a traditional animation studio, established the Computer Graphics Lab (CGL) and recruited computer scientists who shared his ambitions about creating the world&#x27;s first computer-animated film. Edwin Catmull and Malcolm Blanchard were the first to be hired and were soon joined by Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco some months later, who were the four original members of the Computer Graphics Lab, located in a converted two-story garage acquired from the former Vanderbilt-Whitney estate. Schure invested significant funds into the computer graphics lab, approximately $15 million, providing the resources the group needed but contributing to NYIT&#x27;s financial difficulties. Eventually, the group realized they needed to work in a real film studio to reach their goal. Francis Ford Coppola then invited Smith to his house for a three-day media conference, where Coppola and George Lucas shared their visions for the future of digital moviemaking.

When Lucas approached the group and offered them a job at his studio, six employees moved to Lucasfilm. During the following months, they gradually resigned from CGL, found temporary jobs for about a year to avoid making Schure suspicious, and joined the Graphics Group at Lucasfilm. The Graphics Group, which was one-third of the Computer Division of Lucasfilm, was launched in 1979 with the hiring of Catmull from NYIT, where he was in charge of the Computer Graphics Lab. He was then reunited with Smith, who also made the journey from NYIT to Lucasfilm, and was made the director of the Graphics Group. At NYIT, the researchers pioneered many of the CG foundation techniques — in particular, the invention of the alpha channel by Catmull and Smith. Over the next several years, the CGL would produce a few frames of an experimental film called &quot;The Works&quot;. After moving to Lucasfilm, the team worked on creating the precursor to RenderMan, called REYES (for &quot;renders everything you ever saw&quot;), and developed several critical technologies for CG — including particle effects and various animation tools.

John Lasseter was hired to the Lucasfilm team for a week in late 1983 with the title &quot;interface designer&quot;; he animated the short film &quot;The Adventures of André &amp; Wally B.&quot; In the next few years, a designer suggested naming a new digital compositing computer the &quot;Picture Maker&quot;. Smith suggested that the laser-based device have a catchier name, and came up with &quot;Pixer&quot;, which after a meeting was changed to &quot;Pixar&quot;. According to Michael Rubin, the author of &quot;Droidmaker: George Lucas and the Digital Revolution&quot;, Smith and three other employees came up with the name during a restaurant visit in 1981, but when interviewing them he got four different versions about the origin of the name.

In 1982, the Pixar team began working on special-effects film sequences with Industrial Light &amp; Magic. After years of research, and key milestones such as the Genesis Effect in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; and the Stained Glass Knight in &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot;, the group, which then numbered 40 individuals, was spun out as a corporation in February 1986 by Catmull and Smith. Among the 38 remaining employees were Malcolm Blanchard, David DiFrancesco, Ralph Guggenheim, and Bill Reeves, who had been part of the team since the days of NYIT. Tom Duff, also an NYIT member, would later join Pixar after its formation. With Lucas&#x27;s 1983 divorce, which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from &quot;Star Wars&quot; licenses following the release of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, they knew he would most likely sell the whole Graphics Group. Worried that the employees would be lost to them if that happened, which would prevent the creation of the first computer-animated movie, they concluded that the best way to keep the team together was to turn the group into an independent company. But Moore&#x27;s Law also suggested that sufficient computing power for the first film was still some years away, and they needed to focus on a proper product until then. Eventually, they decided they should be a hardware company in the meantime, with their Pixar Image Computer as the core product, a system primarily sold to governmental, scientific, and medical markets. They also used SGI computers.

In 1983, Nolan Bushnell founded a new computer-guided animation studio called Kadabrascope as a subsidiary of his Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theatres company (PTT), which was founded in 1977. Only one major project was made out of the new studio, an animated Christmas special for NBC starring Chuck E. Cheese and other PTT mascots; known as &quot;Chuck E. Cheese: The Christmas That Almost Wasn&#x27;t&quot;. The animation movement would be made using tweening instead of traditional cel animation. After the video game crash of 1983, Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat. Sente Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) was sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope was sold to Lucasfilm. The Kadabrascope assets were combined with the Computer Division of Lucasfilm. Coincidentally, one of Steve Jobs&#x27;s first jobs was under Bushnell in 1973 as a technician at his other company Atari, which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications in 1976 to focus on PTT. PTT would later go bankrupt in 1984 and be acquired by ShowBiz Pizza Place.

=== Independent company (1986–1999) ===
In 1986, the newly independent Pixar was headed by President Edwin Catmull and Executive Vice President Alvy Ray Smith. Lucas&#x27;s search for investors led to an offer from Steve Jobs, which Lucas initially found too low. He eventually accepted after determining it impossible to find other investors. At that point, Smith and Catmull had been declined by 35 venture capitalists and ten large corporations, including a deal with General Motors which fell through three days before signing the contracts. Jobs, who had been edged out of Apple in 1985, was now founder and CEO of the new computer company NeXT. On February 3, 1986, he paid $5 million of his own money to George Lucas for technology rights and invested $5 million cash as capital into the company, joining the board of directors as chairman.

In 1985 while still at Lucasfilm, they had made a deal with the Japanese publisher Shogakukan to make a computer-animated movie called &quot;Monkey&quot;, based on the Monkey King. The project continued sometime after they became a separate company in 1986, but it became clear that the technology was not sufficiently advanced. The computers were not powerful enough and the budget would be too high. As a result, they focused on the computer hardware business for years until a computer-animated feature became feasible according to Moore&#x27;s law.

At the time, Walt Disney Studios made the decision to develop more efficient ways of producing animation. They reached out to Graphics Group at Lucasfilm and to Digital Productions. Because of the Graphics Group&#x27;s deeper understanding of animation, and Smith&#x27;s experience with paint programs at NYIT, it convinced Disney they were the right choice. In May 1986 Pixar signed a contract with Disney, who eventually bought and used the Pixar Image Computer and custom software written by Pixar as part of its Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) project, to migrate the laborious ink and paint part of the 2D animation process to a more automated method. The company&#x27;s first feature film to be released using this new animation method was &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990).

In a bid to drive sales of the system and increase the company&#x27;s capital, Jobs suggested releasing the product to the mainstream market. Pixar employee John Lasseter, who had long been working on not-for-profit short demonstration animations, such as &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; (1986) to show off the device&#x27;s capabilities, premiered his creations to great fanfare at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics industry&#x27;s largest convention.

However, the Image Computer had inadequate sales which threatened to end the company as financial losses grew. Jobs increased investment in exchange for an increased stake, reducing the proportion of management and employee ownership until eventually, his total investment of $50 million gave him control of the entire company. In 1989, Lasseter&#x27;s growing animation department which was originally composed of just four people (Lasseter, Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Sam Leffler), was turned into a division that produced computer-animated commercials for outside companies. In April 1990, Pixar sold its hardware division, including all proprietary hardware technology and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and transferred 18 of Pixar&#x27;s approximately 100 employees. In the same year Pixar moved from San Rafael to Richmond, California. Pixar released some of its software tools on the open market for Macintosh and Windows systems. RenderMan is one of the leading 3D packages of the early 1990s, and Typestry is a special-purpose 3D text renderer that competed with RayDream.

During this period of time, Pixar continued its successful relationship with Walt Disney Feature Animation, a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately become its most important partner. As 1991 began, however, the layoff of 30 employees in the company&#x27;s computer hardware department—including the company&#x27;s president, Chuck Kolstad, reduced the total number of employees to just 42, approximately its original number. On March 6, 1991, Steve Jobs bought the company from its employees and became the full owner. He contemplated folding it into NeXT, but the NeXT&#x27;s co-founders refused. A few months later Pixar made a historic $26 million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995), the product of the technological limitations that challenged CGI. By then the software programmers working on RenderMan and IceMan, and Lasseter&#x27;s animation department, which made television commercials (and four Luxo Jr. shorts for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; the same year), were all that remained of Pixar.

Despite the income from these projects, the company still continued to lose money and Steve Jobs, as chairman of the board and now owner, often considered selling it. As late as 1994, Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies such as Hallmark Cards, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and Oracle CEO and co-founder Larry Ellison. After learning from New York critics that &quot;Toy Story&quot; would probably be a hit, and confirming that Disney would distribute it for the 1995 Christmas season, he decided to give Pixar another chance. Also for the first time, he took an active leadership role in the company and made himself CEO. &quot;Toy Story&quot; grossed more than $373 million worldwide and, when Pixar held its initial public offering on November 29, 1995, it exceeded Netscape&#x27;s as the biggest IPO of the year. In its first half-hour of trading, Pixar stock shot from $22 to $45, delaying trading because of unmatched buy orders. Shares climbed to and closed the day at $39.

The company continued to make the television commercials during the production of &quot;Toy Story&quot;, which came to an end on July 9, 1996, when Pixar announced they would shut down its television commercial unit, which counted 18 employees, to focus on longer projects and interactive entertainment.

During the 1990s and 2000s, Pixar gradually developed the &quot;Pixar Braintrust&quot;, the studio&#x27;s primary creative development process, in which all of its directors, writers, and lead storyboard artists regularly examine each other&#x27;s projects and give very candid &quot;notes&quot;, the industry term for constructive criticism. The Braintrust operates under a philosophy of a &quot;filmmaker-driven studio&quot;, in which creatives help each other move their films forward through a process somewhat like peer review, as opposed to the traditional Hollywood approach of an &quot;executive-driven studio&quot; in which directors are micromanaged through &quot;mandatory notes&quot; from development executives outranking the producers. According to Catmull, it evolved out of the working relationship between Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, Lee Unkrich, and Joe Ranft on &quot;Toy Story&quot;.

As a result of the success of &quot;Toy Story&quot;, Pixar built a new studio at the Emeryville campus which was designed by PWP Landscape Architecture and opened in November 2000.

=== Collaboration with Disney (1999–2006) ===
Pixar and Disney had disagreements over the production of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. Originally intended as a direct-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar&#x27;s three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement, but Disney refused. Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled marketing and distribution. Profits and production costs were split equally, but Disney exclusively owned all story, character, and sequel rights and also collected a 10- to 15-percent distribution fee.

The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement for ten months and failed on January 26, 2001, July 26, 2002, April 22, 2003, January 16, 2004, July 22, 2004, and January 14, 2005. The proposed distribution deal meant Pixar would control production and own the resulting story, character, and sequel rights, while Disney would own the right of first refusal to distribute any sequels. Pixar also wanted to finance its own films and collect 100 percent profit, paying Disney the 10- to 15-percent distribution fee. In addition, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under the old agreement, including &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (2004) and &quot;Cars&quot; (2006). Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.

Disagreements between Steve Jobs and Disney chairman and CEO Michael Eisner caused the negotiations to cease in 2004, with Disney forming Circle Seven Animation and Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney. Despite this announcement and several talks with Warner Bros., Sony Pictures, and 20th Century Fox, Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors, although a Warner Bros. spokesperson told CNN, &quot;We would love to be in business with Pixar. They are a great company.&quot; After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for its major releases during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying &quot;Cars&quot; from November 4, 2005, to June 9, 2006, was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract, to see how things would play out between the two companies.

Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar, the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, to ensure that if the acquisition failed, this one film would be released through Disney&#x27;s distribution channels. In contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, &quot;Ratatouille&quot; was meant to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received a distribution fee. The completion of Disney&#x27;s Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.

=== Walt Disney Studios subsidiary (2006–present) ===
After extended negotiations, Disney ultimately agreed on January 24, 2006, to buy Pixar for approximately $7.4 billion in an all-stock deal. Following Pixar shareholder approval, the acquisition was completed on May 5, 2006. The transaction catapulted Jobs, who owned 49.65% of total share interest in Pixar, to Disney&#x27;s largest individual shareholder with 7%, valued at $3.9 billion, and a new seat on its board of directors. Jobs&#x27; new Disney holdings exceeded holdings belonging to Eisner, the previous top shareholder, who still held 1.7%; and Disney Director Emeritus Roy E. Disney, who held almost 1% of the corporation&#x27;s shares. Pixar shareholders received 2.3 shares of Disney common stock for each share of Pixar common stock redeemed.

As part of the deal, John Lasseter, by then Executive Vice President, became Chief Creative Officer (reporting directly to president and CEO Bob Iger and consulting with Disney Director Roy E. Disney) of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios (including its division Disneytoon Studios), as well as the Principal Creative Adviser at Walt Disney Imagineering, which designs and builds the company&#x27;s theme parks. Catmull retained his position as President of Pixar, while also becoming President of Walt Disney Animation Studios, reporting to Iger and Dick Cook, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios. Jobs&#x27;s position as Pixar&#x27;s chairman and chief executive officer was abolished, and instead, he took a place on the Disney board of directors.

After the deal closed in May 2006, Lasseter revealed that Iger had felt that Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade at the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005. Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade, none were characters that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar. Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information to the board of directors at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar. Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth-generation iPod Classic), and in turn, Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his feeling that Disney needed to re-focus on animation.
Lasseter and Catmull&#x27;s oversight of both the Disney Feature Animation and Pixar studios did not mean that the two studios were merging, however. In fact, additional conditions were laid out as part of the deal to ensure that Pixar remained a separate entity, a concern that analysts had expressed about the Disney deal. Some of those conditions were that Pixar HR policies would remain intact, including the lack of employment contracts. Also, the Pixar name was guaranteed to continue, and the studio would remain in its current Emeryville, California, location with the &quot;Pixar&quot; sign. Finally, branding of films made post-merger would be &quot;Disney•Pixar&quot; (beginning with &quot;Cars&quot;).

Jim Morris, producer of &quot;WALL-E&quot; (2008), became general manager of Pixar. In this new position, Morris took charge of the day-to-day running of the studio facilities and products.

After a few years, Lasseter and Catmull were able to successfully transfer the basic principles of the Pixar Braintrust to Disney Animation, although meetings of the Disney Story Trust are reportedly &quot;more polite&quot; than those of the Pixar Braintrust. Catmull later explained that after the merger, to maintain the studios&#x27; separate identities and cultures (notwithstanding the fact of common ownership and common senior management), he and Lasseter &quot;drew a hard line&quot; that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and would not be allowed to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other. The rule ensures that each studio maintains &quot;local ownership&quot; of projects and can be proud of its own work. Thus for example, when Pixar had issues with &quot;Ratatouille&quot; and Disney Animation had issues with &quot;Bolt&quot; (2008), &quot;nobody bailed them out&quot; and each studio was required &quot;to solve the problem on its own&quot; despite knowing that there were personnel at the other studio who theoretically could have helped.

==== Expansion and John Lasseter&#x27;s exit (2010–2018) ====
On April 20, 2010, Pixar opened Pixar Canada in the downtown area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The roughly 2,000 square meters studio produced seven short films based on &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Cars&quot; characters. In October 2013, the studio was closed down to refocus Pixar&#x27;s efforts at its main headquarters.

In November 2014, Morris was promoted to president of Pixar, while his counterpart at Disney Animation, general manager Andrew Millstein, was also promoted to president of that studio. Both continued to report to Catmull, who retained the title of president of both Disney Animation and Pixar.

On November 21, 2017, Lasseter announced that he was taking a six-month leave of absence after acknowledging what he called &quot;missteps&quot; in his behavior with employees in a memo to staff. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Lasseter had a history of alleged sexual misconduct towards employees. On June 8, 2018, it was announced that Lasseter would leave Disney Animation and Pixar at the end of the year, but would take on a consulting role until then. Pete Docter was announced as Lasseter&#x27;s replacement as chief creative officer of Pixar on June 19, 2018.

==== Sequels and financial success (2018–2019) ====
On June 15, 2018, &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; was released, setting a record for widest opening weekend worldwide and domestic for an animated film. The film would eventually gross $1.2 billion worldwide. On October 23, 2018, it was announced that Catmull would be retiring. He stayed in an adviser role until July 2019. On January 18, 2019, it was announced that Lee Unkrich would be leaving Pixar after 25 years. On June 21, 2019, &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; was released, surpassing the widest opening worldwide weekend record that &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; set. The film would make over $1 billion and win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. During the 2019 D23 Expo, Pixar announced that their next film, &quot;Soul&quot;, would release in 2020. Ahead of the launch of Disney+, Pixar debuted &quot;SparkShorts&quot;, experimental shorts done by Pixar staff.

==== COVID-19, Disney+ releases, and some financial struggles (2020–present) ====
Pixar released &quot;Onward&quot; on March 6, 2020. However, due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the film underperformed at the box office and was released onto rental digital services on March 20, and later on Disney+ on April 3. Due to the pandemic, &quot;Soul&quot; was moved to November 2020, and ultimately released on December 25, 2020, on Disney+ at no additional cost to subscribers, and later became the first animated streaming film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Pixar&#x27;s next two features, &quot;Luca&quot; and &quot;Turning Red&quot;, were also released free on Disney+ in June 2021 and March 2022, respectively. In 2021, several Pixar employees anonymously criticized Disney&#x27;s decision to release their films direct to Disney+.

&quot;Lightyear&quot;, Pixar&#x27;s first movie to return to theaters was released in June 2022. The film became a box-office failure with &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; calculating the film lost the studio $106 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues. In September 2022, Jonas Rivera was promoted to Executive VP of Film Production at Pixar overseeing all film and streaming production. In December 2022, Disney CEO Bob Iger noted that they would rely more on the Pixar brand. In June 2023, Disney laid off 75 employees including the director of &quot;Lightyear&quot; Angus MacLane, and the film&#x27;s producer Galyn Susman.

During that same month, &quot;Elemental&quot; was released. During the film&#x27;s opening weekend, Docter stated that Pixar &quot;trained audiences that these films will be available for you on Disney+&quot;. Despite opening below projections, &quot;Elemental&quot; ultimately made a box office comeback by early August 2023, crossing $400 million at the worldwide box office. Disney&#x27;s EVP of Theatrical Distribution Tony Chambers stated &quot;After a disappointing opening weekend, we&#x27;re really pleased that audiences have discovered what a great movie it is.&quot; That same month, Morris said &quot;at the box office we&#x27;re looking at now, [the film] should do better than break even theatrically. And then we have revenue from streaming, theme parks and consumer products. This will certainly be a profitable film for the Disney company.&quot; In December 2023, it was announced that &quot;Soul&quot;, &quot;Turning Red&quot; and &quot;Luca&quot; would be released in theaters in the United States in the first quarter of 2024.

In January 2024, it was reported that Pixar&#x27;s staff would face imminent layoffs by 20 percent, reducing the studio&#x27;s workforce to less than 1,000 employees. However, the layoffs were then delayed and did not occur, reportedly because of production schedules. In May 2024, the studio proceeded with slightly smaller layoffs: 175 employees or approximately 14 percent of the studio&#x27;s workforce of over 1,300 employees. The layoffs occurred as the studio began to rely less on direct-to-streaming series and more on feature films intended primarily for theatrical exhibition.

On June 14 of the same year, &quot;Inside Out 2&quot; was released and became financially successful. The film had a domestic opening of $154 million, the third highest for an animated film, and the biggest global opening for an animated movie with $294 million. Since then the film broke multiple box office records. It had the highest second weekend gross for an animated film with $100 million, being the first to reach the 6 digit second opening weekend. It became the fastest animated movie to reach $1 billion at the global box office, reaching the milestone in 17 days. It also out-grossed &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; to become the highest grossing Pixar film globally.

== Campus ==
When Steve Jobs, chief executive officer of Apple Inc. and Pixar, and John Lasseter, then-executive vice president of Pixar, decided to move their studios from a leased space in Point Richmond, California, to larger quarters of their own, they chose a 20-acre site in Emeryville, California, formerly occupied by Del Monte Foods, Inc. The first of several buildings, the high-tech structure designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson has special foundations and electricity generators to ensure continued film production, even through major earthquakes. The character of the building is intended to abstractly recall Emeryville&#x27;s industrial past. The two-story steel-and-masonry building is a collaborative space with many pathways.

The digital revolution in filmmaking was driven by applied mathematics, including computational physics and geometry. In 2008, this led Pixar senior scientist Tony DeRose to offer to host the second Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at the Emeryville campus.

=== Traditions ===
Some of Pixar&#x27;s first animators were former cel animators including John Lasseter, and others came from computer animation or were fresh college graduates. A large number of animators that make up its animation department had been hired around the releases of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998), &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; (2001), and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003). The success of &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995) made Pixar the first major computer-animation studio to successfully produce theatrical feature films. The majority of the animation industry was (and still is) located in Los Angeles, and Pixar is located north in the San Francisco Bay Area. Traditional hand-drawn animation was still the dominant medium for feature animated films.

With the scarcity of Los Angeles-based animators willing to move their families so far north to give up traditional animation and try computer animation, Pixar&#x27;s new hires at this time either came directly from college or had worked outside feature animation. For those who had traditional animation skills, the Pixar animation software Marionette was designed so that traditional animators would require a minimum amount of training before becoming productive.

In a 2007 interview with PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley, Lasseter said that Pixar&#x27;s films follow the same theme of self-improvement as the company itself has: with the help of friends or family, a character ventures out into the real world and learns to appreciate his friends and family. At the core, Lasseter said, &quot;it&#x27;s gotta be about the growth of the main character and how he changes.&quot;

Actor John Ratzenberger, who had previously starred in the television series &quot;Cheers&quot; (1982–1993), has voiced a character in every Pixar feature film from &quot;Toy Story&quot; through &quot;Onward&quot; (2020). A non-speaking background character in &quot;Soul&quot; (2020) bears his likeness. Pixar paid tribute to Ratzenberger in the end credits of &quot;Cars&quot; (2006) by parodying scenes from three of its earlier films (&quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, and &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;), replacing all of the characters with motor vehicle versions of them and giving each film an automotive-based title. After the third scene, Mack (his character in &quot;Cars&quot;) realizes that the same actor has been voicing characters in every film.

Due to the traditions that have occurred within the films and shorts such as anthropomorphic creatures and objects, and easter egg crossovers between films and shorts that have been spotted by Pixar fans, a blog post titled &quot;The Pixar Theory&quot; was published in 2013 by Jon Negroni, and popularized by the YouTube channel Super Carlin Brothers, proposing that all of the characters within the Pixar universe were related, surrounding Boo from &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot; and the Witch from &quot;Brave&quot; (2012).

Additionally, Pixar is known for their films having expensive budgets, ranging from $150–200 million. Some of these films include &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007), &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010), &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019), &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; (2018), &quot;Inside Out&quot; (2015), &quot;Inside Out 2&quot; (2024), &quot;The Good Dinosaur&quot; (2015), the aforementioned &quot;Onward&quot; and &quot;Soul&quot;, &quot;Turning Red&quot;, &quot;Lightyear&quot; (both 2022), and &quot;Elemental&quot; (2023). In a 2023 interview, Pixar&#x27;s president Jim Morris stated that one of the reasons why their films have expensive budgets is because they are produced entirely in the U.S. with all of the artists under one roof, while almost all of their competitors keep costs down by doing work offshore.

=== Sequels and prequels ===

As of September 2022, six Pixar films have received or will receive sequels or prequels. These films are &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;Cars&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, and &quot;Inside Out&quot;.

&quot;Toy Story 2&quot; was originally commissioned by Disney as a 60-minute direct-to-video film. Expressing doubts about the strength of the material, John Lasseter convinced the Pixar team to start from scratch and make the sequel their third full-length feature film.

Following the release of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; in 1999, Pixar and Disney had a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar&#x27;s involvement though retaining a right to do so. After the two companies were unable to agree on a new deal, Disney announced in 2004 they would plan to move forward on sequels with or without Pixar and put &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; into pre-production at Disney&#x27;s then-new CGI division Circle Seven Animation. However, when Lasseter was placed in charge of all Disney and Pixar animation following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Pixar in 2006, he put all sequels on hold and &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was canceled. In May 2006, it was announced that &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was back in pre-production with a new plot and under Pixar&#x27;s control. The film was released on June 18, 2010, as Pixar&#x27;s eleventh feature film.

Shortly after announcing the resurrection of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, Lasseter stated, &quot;If we have a great story, we&#x27;ll do a sequel.&quot; &quot;Cars 2&quot;, Pixar&#x27;s first non-&quot;Toy Story&quot; sequel, was officially announced in April 2008 and released on June 24, 2011, as their twelfth. &quot;Monsters University&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; (2001), was announced in April 2010 and initially set for release in November 2012; the release date was pushed to June 21, 2013, due to Pixar&#x27;s past success with summer releases, according to a Disney executive.

In June 2011, Tom Hanks, who voiced Woody in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; series, implied that &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; was &quot;in the works&quot;, although it had not yet been confirmed by the studio. In April 2013, &quot;Finding Dory&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, was announced for a June 17, 2016, release. In March 2014, &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; and &quot;Cars 3&quot; were announced as films in development. In November 2014, &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; was confirmed to be in development with Lasseter serving as director. However, in July 2017, Lasseter announced that he had stepped down, leaving Josh Cooley as sole director. Released in June 2019, &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; ranks among the 40 top-grossing films in American cinema.

On July 3, 2016, Pixar president Jim Morris announced that the studio might be moving away from sequels after &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;. This was affirmed by producer Mark Nielsen in May 2019. Shortly after its release, Pixar&#x27;s chief creative officer Pete Docter confirmed that the studio would take a break from sequels and focus on original projects. However, in a later interview, Docter said the studio would have to return to making sequels at some point for its &quot;financial safety&quot;. In September 2022, during the D23 Expo, Docter and Amy Poehler (voice of Joy in &quot;Inside Out&quot;) confirmed that &quot;Inside Out 2&quot; was in development, with the film being released on June 14, 2024. In February 2023, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that &quot;Toy Story 5&quot; was in development, aiming for a 2026 release. In August 2024, during the D23 Expo, Docter announced that &quot;Incredibles 3&quot; is in development, with Brad Bird returning to develop.

That same month, on the subject of making a sequel, Docter stated &quot;I want to make it because we have something new to say with these characters. And there&#x27;s been a number of films that we would love to have a sequel to, that we couldn&#x27;t find something.&quot;

=== Adaptation to television ===

&quot;Toy Story&quot; is the first Pixar film to be adapted for television as a &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot; film and TV series on the UPN television network, now The CW. &quot;Cars&quot; became the second with the help of &quot;Cars Toons&quot;, a series of 3-to-5-minute short films running between regular Disney Channel show intervals and featuring Mater from &quot;Cars&quot;. Between 2013 and 2014, Pixar released its first two television specials, &quot;Toy Story of Terror!&quot; and &quot;Toy Story That Time Forgot&quot;. &quot;Monsters at Work&quot;, a television series spin-off of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; produced by Disney Television Animation, premiered in July 2021 on Disney+.

On December 10, 2020, it was announced that three series would be released on Disney+. The first is &quot;Dug Days&quot; (featuring Dug from &quot;Up&quot; (2009)), which premiered on September 1, 2021. The second is a &quot;Cars&quot; show, titled &quot;Cars on the Road&quot;, which follows Mater and Lightning McQueen as they go on a road trip. It premiered on Disney+ on September 8, 2022. An original show entitled &quot;Win or Lose&quot;, which will follow a middle school softball team the week leading up to the big championship game where each episode will be from a different perspective, premiered on Disney+ on February 19, 2025.

A TV series based on &quot;Inside Out&quot; was announced to be in development for Disney+ in June 2023, with &quot;Soul&quot; co-writer Mike Jones hired as developer. The series, titled &quot;Dream Productions&quot;, premiered on Disney+ on December 11, 2024.

=== 2D animation and live-action ===
The Pixar filmography to date has been computer-animated features. So far, &quot;WALL-E&quot; (2008) has been the only Pixar film not to be completely animated as it features a small amount of live-action, including footage from the 1969 film &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; while the short films &quot;Your Friend the Rat&quot; (2007), &quot;Day &amp; Night&quot; (2010), &quot;Kitbull&quot; (2019), &quot;Burrow&quot; (2020), and &quot;Twenty Something&quot; (2021) feature 2D animation. &quot;1906&quot;, the live-action film by Brad Bird based on a screenplay and novel by James Dalessandro about the 1906 earthquake, was in development but has since been abandoned by Bird and Pixar. Bird has stated that he was &quot;interested in moving into the live-action realm with some projects&quot; while &quot;staying at Pixar [because] it&#x27;s a very comfortable environment for me to work in&quot;. In June 2018, Bird mentioned the possibility of adapting the novel as a TV series, and the earthquake sequence as a live-action feature film.

The &quot;Toy Story Toons&quot; short &quot;Hawaiian Vacation&quot; (2011) also includes the fish and shark as live-action.

Jim Morris, president of Pixar, produced Disney&#x27;s &quot;John Carter&quot; (2012) which Andrew Stanton co-wrote and directed.

Pixar&#x27;s creative heads were consulted to fine tune the script for the 2011 live-action film &quot;The Muppets&quot;. Similarly, Pixar assisted in the story development of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (2016) as well as providing suggestions for the film&#x27;s end credits sequence. Both Pixar and Mark Andrews were given a &quot;Special Thanks&quot; credit in the film&#x27;s credits. Additionally, many Pixar animators, both former and current, were recruited for a traditional hand-drawn animated sequence for the 2018 film &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;.

Pixar representatives have also assisted in the English localization of several Studio Ghibli films, mainly those from Hayao Miyazaki.

In 2019, Pixar developed a live-action hidden camera reality show, titled &quot;Pixar in Real Life&quot;, for Disney+.

=== Upcoming films ===
Four upcoming films have been announced: original film &quot;Elio&quot;, directed by Domee Shi and Madeline Sharafian with initial direction by Adrian Molina and to be released on , original film &quot;Hoppers&quot;, directed by Daniel Chong and to be released on , sequel &quot;Toy Story 5&quot;, directed by Andrew Stanton and to be released on , and sequel &quot;Incredibles 3&quot;, currently without a release date.

<text>In some stories from Greek mythology, Itylus or Itylos (Ancient Greek: Ἴτυλος) was the son of Aedon, who was the daughter of Pandareus of Ephesus and the wife of King Zethus of Thebes.

In others, Itys was the son of Procne and Tereus.

== Mythology ==

Aedon was envious of Niobe, her sister-in-law, who had six sons and six daughters. Aedon planned to kill the eldest of Niobe&#x27;s sons, but by mistake killed her own son Itylus. Zeus relieved her grief by changing her into a nightingale, whose songs are Aedon&#x27;s lamentations about her child.

The story was an ancient one; for example, Homer&#x27;s listeners were expected to know the allusion, when Penelope reveals to the still-disguised Odysseus her anguish: I lie on my bed, and the sharp anxieties swarming&lt;br&gt;thick and fast on my beating heart torment my sorrowing self.&lt;br&gt;As when Pandareos&#x27; daughter, the greenwood nightingale&lt;br&gt;perching in the deep of the forest foliage sings out&lt;br&gt;her lovely song when springtime is just begun, she varying&lt;br&gt;the manifold strains of her voice, pours out the melody&lt;br&gt;mourning Itylos, son of the lord Zethos, her own beloved&lt;br&gt;child, whom she once killed with the bronze, when the madness was upon her;&lt;br&gt;So my mind is divided, and starts one way, then another. —&quot;Odyssey&quot; xix.519-24; Richmond Lattimore&#x27;s translation).

As one of only nine similes in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; that are longer than five lines, the thematic complexity of the image and its multiple points of contact with Penelope&#x27;s situation has arrested the attention of many readers.

In an explanatory &quot;scholium&quot; on this passage, an anonymous scholiast, echoed by Eustathius, explains that Aedon attempted to kill Amaleus, the son of her sister-in-law and rival, Niobe, but accidentally killed her own son instead: thus, the gods changed her into a nightingale to weep for eternity. The setting of the episode is Thebes.

Attic authors later than Homer, including the dramatists, knew a different nightingale myth in which Procne was married to Tereus, who raped her sister Philomela. Tereus cut out Philomela&#x27;s tongue so that she could not tell. (In some versions, Philomela is the name of the wife, Procne of her mutilated sister.) Philomela wove her story into a robe that she gave to Procne. In a fit of madness, Procne then murdered her own child by Tereus, Itys. All were changed to birds, though the specific birds vary; for example, in Ovid, Philomela is changed to a nightingale. For more details, see Philomela.

<text>Fritjof Capra (born February 1, 1939) is an Austrian-born American author, physicist, systems theorist and deep ecologist. In 1995, he became a founding director of the Center for Ecoliteracy in Berkeley, California. He was on the faculty of Schumacher College which was disestablished in 2024.

Capra is the author of several books, including &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot; (1975), &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1982), &quot;Uncommon Wisdom&quot; (1988), &quot;The Web of Life&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Hidden Connections&quot; (2002), and co-author of &quot;The Systems View of Life&quot; (2014).

== Life and work ==
Born in Vienna, Austria, Capra attended the University of Vienna, where he earned his PhD in theoretical physics in 1966. He conducted research in particle physics and systems theory at the University of Paris (1966–1968), the University of California, Santa Cruz (1968–1970), the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (1970), Imperial College, London (1971–1974) and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (1975–1988). While at Berkeley, he was a member of the Fundamental Fysiks Group, founded in May 1975 by Elizabeth Rauscher and George Weissmann, which met weekly to discuss philosophy and quantum physics. He also taught at U.C. Santa Cruz, U.C. Berkeley, and San Francisco State University.

He has written popular books on the implications of science, notably &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot; (1975), subtitled &quot;An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism&quot;. &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot; asserts that both physics and metaphysics lead inexorably to the same knowledge. After touring Germany in the early 1980s, Capra co-wrote &quot;Green Politics&quot; with author Charlene Spretnak in 1984.

He is fluent in German, English, French and Italian.

Capra contributed to the screenplay for the 1990 movie &quot;Mindwalk&quot;, starring Liv Ullmann, Sam Waterston and John Heard. The film is loosely based on his book, &quot;The Turning Point&quot;.

In 1991 Capra co-authored &quot;Belonging to the Universe&quot; with David Steindl-Rast, a Benedictine monk. Using Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; as a stepping stone, the book explores parallels between new paradigm thinking in science and in religion; the authors posit that, together, these new paradigms offer remarkably compatible views about the universe.

Capra advocates that Western culture abandon conventional linear thought and the mechanistic views of Descartes. Critiquing the reductionistic Cartesian view that everything can be studied in parts to understand the whole, he encourages a holistic approach. In &quot;The Web of Life&quot;, Capra focuses on systemic information generated by the &quot;relationships&quot; among all parts as a significant additional factor in understanding the character of the whole, emphasizing the web-like structure of all systems and the interconnectedness of all parts.

He is a founding director of the Center for Ecoliteracy located in Berkeley, California, which promotes ecology and systems thinking in primary and secondary education.

Capra is an Earth Charter International Council member.

== Bibliography ==

* &quot;The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism&quot; (1975), Capra&#x27;s first book, draws parallels between Vedic and Oriental mystical traditions and the discoveries of 20th century physics. Originally published by a small publisher with no budget for promotion, the book became a bestseller by word of mouth until it was picked up by a major American publishing house. It has now been published in 43 editions in 23 languages. It is credited as a major influence for the rise of quantum mysticism.
* &quot;The Turning Point: Science, Society, and the Rising Culture&quot; (1982) explains perceived scientific and economic crises. It begins by outlining and tracing the history of science and economics, and criticizing Cartesian, Newtonian, and reductionist paradigms. It argues that such viewpoints have grown inadequate for modern technology and ecology needs, and that science needs to develop the concepts and insights of holism and systems theory to solve society&#x27;s complex problems.
* &quot;Green Politics&quot; (1984), co-authored with Charlene Spretnak, analyzes the rise of the Green Party in Germany and similar ecology-oriented political parties in other European countries. It has been published in 7 editions in 4 languages.
* &quot;Uncommon Wisdom&quot; (1988) describes dialogues and personal encounters between himself and the thinkers who helped to shape the theme of &quot;The Turning Point&quot;. It has been published in 16 editions and 12 languages.
* &quot;Belonging to the Universe: Explorations on the Frontiers of Science and Spirituality&quot; (1993) was coauthored with David Steindl-Rast and Thomas Matus. The book explores parallels between ways of thinking in science and Christian theology. It has been published in 10 editions in 7 languages.
* &quot;The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems&quot; (1996) starts from the conceptual framework presented in &quot;The Turning Point&quot;, summarizes the mathematics of complexity, and offers a synthesis of recent nonlinear theories of living systems that have dramatically increased our understanding of the key characteristics of life. Capra makes extensive reference to the work of Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, Ilya Prigogine, Gregory Bateson and others in proposing a new, systems-based scientific approach for describing the interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena. The book has been published in 14 editions in 10 languages.
* &quot;The Hidden Connections&quot; (2002) extends the framework of systems and complexity theory to the social domain and uses the extended framework to discuss some of the critical issues of our time.
* &quot;The Science of Leonardo: Inside the Mind of the Great Genius of the Renaissance&quot; (2007). Its central idea is that Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s science is a science of living forms, of quality, which can be seen as a distant forerunner of today&#x27;s complexity and systems theories. The book has been published in 7 editions in 5 languages.
* &quot;Learning from Leonardo: Decoding the Notebooks of a Genius&quot; (2013), offers a glimpse into the works of the prescient thinker, Leonardo da Vinci, whose pioneering genius contributed to many scientific fields. 
* &quot;The Systems View of Life&quot; (2014), co-authored with Pier Luigi Luisi, offers radical solutions to twenty-first century challenges by focusing on the connected world and examining life through its inextricably linked systems.
* &quot;Patterns of Connection: Essential Essays from Five Decades&quot; (2021) is a personal account of the author&#x27;s intellectual journey, documented by a series of essays together with extensive commentaries that interweave the essays and provide historical and philosophical context.

<doc id="78972" wikidata="Q599737" url="?curid=78972" title="Marsyas">
<text>In Greek mythology, the satyr Marsyas (; ) is a central figure in two stories involving music: in one, he picked up the double oboe (&quot;aulos&quot;) that had been abandoned by Athena and played it; in the other, he challenged Apollo to a contest of music and lost his hide and life. Literary sources from antiquity often emphasize the &quot;hubris&quot; of Marsyas and the justice of his punishment.

One strand of modern comparative mythography regards the domination of Marsyas by Apollo as an example of myth that recapitulates a supposed supplanting by the Olympian pantheon of an earlier &quot;Pelasgian&quot; religion of chthonic heroic ancestors and nature spirits.
Marsyas was a devoté of the ancient Mother Goddess Rhea/Cybele, and the mythographers situate his episodes in Celaenae (or Kelainai), in Phrygia, at the main source of the Meander (the river Menderes in Turkey).

== Family ==
When a genealogy was applied to him, Marsyas was the son of the &quot;divine&quot; Hyagnis. His father was called Oeagrus or Olympus. Alternatively, the latter was said to be Marsyas&#x27; son and/or pupil and &quot;eromenos&quot;.

== Mythology ==

===The finding of the aulos===

Marsyas was an expert player on the double-piped double reed instrument known as the aulos. The dithyrambic poet Melanippides of Melos ( 480 – 430 BC) embellished the story in his dithyramb &quot;Marsyas&quot;, claiming that the goddess Athena, who was already said to have invented the aulos, once looked in the mirror while she was playing it and saw how blowing into it puffed up her cheeks and made her look silly, so she threw the aulos away and cursed it so that whoever picked it up would meet an awful death. Marsyas picked up the aulos and was later killed by Apollo for his hubris. The fifth-century BC poet Telestes doubted that virginal Athena could have been motivated by such vanity.

Later, however, Melanippides&#x27;s story became accepted as canonical and the Athenian sculptor Myron created a group of bronze sculptures based on it, which was installed before the western front of the Parthenon around 440 BC. In the second century AD, the travel writer Pausanias saw this set of sculptures and described it as &quot;a statue of Athena striking Marsyas the Silenos for taking up the flutes [aulos] that the goddess wished to be cast away for good&quot;.

=== Marsyas and Apollo ===
In the contest between Apollo and Marsyas, which was judged by the Muses or the Nysean nymphs, the terms stated that the winner could treat the defeated party any way he wanted. Marsyas played his flute, putting everyone there into a frenzy, and they started dancing wildly. When it was Apollo&#x27;s turn, he played his lyre so beautifully that everyone was still and had tears in their eyes. 

There are several versions of the contest; according to Hyginus, Marsyas was departing as victor after the first round, when Apollo, turning his lyre upside down, played the same tune. This was something that Marsyas could not do with his flute. According to Diodorus Siculus, Marsyas was defeated when Apollo added his voice to the sound of the lyre. Marsyas protested, arguing that the skill with the instrument was to be compared, not the voice. However, Apollo replied that when Marsyas blew into the pipes, he was doing almost the same thing. The Nysean nymphs supported Apollo&#x27;s claim, leading to his victory.

Yet another version states that Marsyas played the flute out of tune, and hence accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he chose the penalty of being skinned to be used as a winesack.

He was flayed alive in a cave near Celaenae for his hubris to challenge a deity. Apollo then nailed Marsyas&#x27; skin to a pine tree, near Lake Aulocrene (&quot;Karakuyu Gölü&quot; in modern Turkey), which Strabo noted was full of the reeds from which the pipes were fashioned. Diodorus Siculus felt that Apollo must have repented this &quot;excessive&quot; deed, and said that he had laid aside his lyre for a while, but Karl Kerenyi observes of the flaying of Marsyas&#x27; &quot;shaggy hide: a penalty which will not seem especially cruel if one assumes that Marsyas&#x27; animal guise was merely a masquerade&quot;. Classical Greeks were unaware of such shamanistic overtones, and the flaying of Marsyas became a theme for painting and sculpture. His brothers, nymphs, gods, and goddesses mourned his death, and their tears, according to Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, were the source of the river Marsyas in Phrygia (called Çine Creek today), which joins the Meander near Celaenae, where Herodotus reported that the flayed skin of Marsyas was still to be seen, and Ptolemy Hephaestion recorded a &quot;festival of Apollo, where the skins of all those victims one has flayed are offered to the god&quot;.

Plato was of the opinion that the skin of Marsyas had been made into a wineskin.
Ovid touches upon the theme of Marsyas twice, very briefly telling the tale in &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; vi.383–400, where he concentrates on the tears shed into the river Marsyas, and making an allusion in &quot;Fasti&quot;, vi.649–710, where Ovid&#x27;s primary focus is on the &quot;aulos&quot; and the roles of flute-players rather than Marsyas, whose name is not mentioned.

== The wise Marsyas ==
The hubristic Marsyas in surviving literary sources eclipses the figure of the wise Marsyas that is suggested in a few words by the Hellenistic historian Diodorus Siculus, who refers to Marsyas as admired for his intelligence (&quot;sunesis&quot;) and self-control (&quot;sophrosune&quot;), not qualities found by Greeks in ordinary satyrs. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, when Alcibiades likens Socrates to Marsyas, it is this aspect of the wise satyr that is intended. Jocelyn Small identifies in Marsyas an artist great enough to challenge a deity, who can only be defeated through a ruse. A prominent statue of Marsyas as a wise old silenus stood near the Roman Forum.

This is the Marsyas of the journal, &quot;Marsyas: Studies in the History of Art&quot;, published since 1941 by students of the Institute of Art, New York University.

== Prophecy and free speech at Rome ==
Among the Romans, Marsyas was cast as the inventor of augury and a proponent of free speech (the philosophical concept παρρησία, &quot;parrhesia&quot;) and &quot;speaking truth to power&quot;. The earliest known representation of Marsyas at Rome stood for at least 300 years in the Roman Forum near or in the comitium, the space for political activity. He also was depicted as a &quot;silen&quot;, carrying a wineskin on his left shoulder and raising his right arm. The statue was regarded as an &quot;indicium libertatis&quot;, a symbol of liberty, and was associated with demonstrations of the &quot;plebs&quot;, or common people. It often served as a sort of kiosk upon which invective verse was posted.

Marsyas served as a minister for Dionysus or Bacchus, who was identified by the Romans with their Father Liber, one of three deities in the Aventine Triad, along with Ceres and Libera (identified with Persephone). These deities were regarded as concerning themselves specially with the welfare of the &quot;plebs&quot;. The freedom that the ecstasies of Dionysian worship represented took on a political meaning in Rome as the &quot;libertas&quot; that distinguished the free from the enslaved. The Liberalia, celebrated March 17 in honor of Liber, was a time of speaking freely, as the poet and playwright Gnaeus Naevius declared: &quot;At the Liberalia games we enjoy free speech.&quot; Nonetheless, Naevius was arrested for his invectives against the powerful.
Marsyas was sometimes considered a king and contemporary of Faunus, portrayed by Vergil as a native Italian ruler at the time of Aeneas. Servius, in his commentary on the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, says that Marsyas sent Faunus envoys who showed techniques of augury to the Italians. The plebeian &quot;gens&quot; of the Marcii claimed that they were descended from Marsyas. Gaius Marcius Rutilus, who rose to power from the &quot;plebs&quot;, is credited with having dedicated the statue that stood in the Roman forum, most likely in 294 BC, when he became the first plebeian censor and added the &quot;cognomen&quot; Censorinus to the family name. Marcius Rutilus was also among the first plebeian augurs, co-opted into their college in 300 BC, and so the mythical teacher of augury was an apt figure to represent him.
In 213 BC, two years after suffering one of the worst military defeats in its history at the Battle of Cannae, Rome was in the grip of a reactionary fear that led to excessive religiosity. The senate, alarmed that its authority was being undermined by &quot;prophets and sacrificers&quot; in the forum, began a program of suppression. Among the literature confiscated was an &quot;authentic&quot; prophecy calling for the institution of games in the Greek manner for Apollo, which the Roman senate and elected officials would control. The prophecy was attributed to Gnaeus Marcius, reputed to be a descendant of Marsyas. The games were duly carried out, but the Romans failed to bring the continuing wars with the Carthaginians to a victorious conclusion until they heeded a second prophecy and imported the worship of the Phrygian Great Mother, Cybele, whose song Marsyas was said to have composed; the song had further relevance in that it was also credited by the Phrygians with protecting them from invaders. The power relations between Marsyas and Apollo reflected the continuing Struggle of the Orders between the elite and the common people, expressed in political terms by &quot;optimates&quot; and &quot;populares&quot;. The arrest of Naevius for exercising free speech also took place during this period.

Another descendant of Marcius Rutilus, L. Marcius Censorinus, issued coins depicting the statue of Marsyas, at a time when the augural college was the subject of political controversy during the Sullan civil wars of the 80s BC. On the coin, Marsyas wears a Phrygian cap or &quot;pilleus&quot;, an emblem of liberty. This Marcius Censorinus was killed by Sulla and his head displayed outside Praeneste. Sulla&#x27;s legislative program attempted to curtail power invested in the people, particularly restricting the powers of the plebeian tribunes, and to restore the dominance of the senate and the privileges of patricians.

Marsyas was claimed as the eponym of the Marsi as well, one of the ancient peoples of Italy. The Social War of 91–88 BC, in which the Italian peoples fought to advance their status as citizens under Roman rule, is sometimes called the Marsic War because of the leadership of the Marsi. The Roman Paestum and Alba Fucens, along with other Italian cities, set up their own statues of Marsyas as assertions of their political status.

During the Principate, Marsyas became a subversive symbol in opposition to Augustus, whose propaganda systematically associated Augustus with Apollo as the torturer of sileni. Augustus&#x27;s daughter Julia held nocturnal assemblies at the statue, and crowned it to defy her father. The poet Ovid, who was ultimately exiled by Augustus, twice tells the story of Marsyas&#x27;s flaying by Apollo, in his epic &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and in the &quot;Fasti&quot;, the calendrical poem left unfinished at his death. Although the immediate cause of Ovid&#x27;s exile remains one of literary history&#x27;s great mysteries, Ovid says that a &quot;poem and transgression&quot; were contributing factors; his poetry tests the boundaries of permissible free speech during Rome&#x27;s transition from republic to imperial monarchy.

Pliny indicates that in the first century AD, the painting &quot;Marsyas religatus&quot; (&quot;Marsyas Bound&quot;), by Zeuxis of Heraclea, could be viewed at the Temple of Concordia in Rome. The goddess Concordia, like the Greek Harmonia, was a personification of both musical harmony as it was understood in antiquity, and of social order, as expressed by Cicero&#x27;s phrase &quot;concordia ordinum&quot;. The apparent incongruity of exhibiting the tortured silenus in a temple devoted to harmony has been interpreted in modern scholarship as a warning against criticizing authority.

===The Louvre&#x27;s Apollo–Marsyas sarcophagus===

A sarcophagus depicting the competition between Marsyas and Apollo, dating to around 300 CE, was discovered in 1853 on the bank of the river Chiarone in Tuscany, on the former Emilia-Aurelia road. Its gathering of deities reads visually from left to right, starting from Athena with her staff and Erichthonius, forming her caduceus, which is partially broken along with a portion of her arm. In Greek myth, Athena was once associated with the pipes that later became those of Marsyas, so that other narratives were developed explaining the transfer as Athena having discarded the instrument in a pique (as in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;). The flaying of Marsyas is set on the end opposite to Athena, on the extreme right.

== In later arts ==

In the art of later periods, allegory is applied to gloss over the somewhat ambivalent morality of the flaying of Marsyas. Marsyas is often seen with a flute, pan pipes, or even bagpipes. Apollo is shown with his lyre, or sometimes a harp, viol, or other stringed instrument. The contest of Apollo and Marsyas is seen as symbolizing the eternal struggle between the Apollonian and Dionysian aspects of human nature and cultures.

Paintings taking Marsyas as a subject include &quot;Apollo and Marsyas&quot; by Michelangelo Anselmi (c. 1492 – c.1554), &quot;The Flaying of Marsyas&quot; by Jusepe de Ribera (1591–1652), the &quot;Flaying of Marsyas&quot; by Titian (c. 1570–1576), &quot;Apollo and Marsyas&quot; by Bartolomeo Manfredi (St. Louis Art Museum), and &quot;Apollo and Marsyas&quot; by Luca Giordano (c.1665).

James Merrill based a poem, &quot;Marsyas&quot;, on this myth; it appears in &quot;The Country of a Thousand Years of Peace&quot; (1959). Zbigniew Herbert and Nadine Sabra Meyer each entitled poems &quot;Apollo and Marsyas&quot;. Following Ovid&#x27;s retelling of the Apollo and Marsyas tale, the poem &quot;The Flaying Of Marsyas&quot; features in Robin Robertson&#x27;s 1997 collection &quot;a painted field&quot;.

Hugo Claus based his poem, &quot;Marsua&quot; (included in the 1955 poem collection Oostakkerse Gedichten), on the myth of Marsyas, describing the process of flaying from the perspective of Marsyas.

In 2002, British artist Anish Kapoor created and installed an enormous sculpture in London&#x27;s Tate Modern entitled, &quot;Marsyas&quot;. Consisting of three huge steel rings and a single red PVC membrane, The work was impossible to view as a whole because of its size, but had obvious anatomical connotations.

A bridge that was built toward the end of the Roman period on the river Marsyas is still called by the satyr&#x27;s name, &quot;Marsiyas&quot;.

The late composer Kyle Rieger wrote a duet for saxophone and piano based on the contest between Marsyas and Apollo titled &quot;Aulos &amp; Lyre&quot;.

<doc id="78973" wikidata="Q2738502" url="?curid=78973" title="Niobids">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Niobids were the children of Amphion of Thebes and Niobe, slain by Apollo and Artemis because Niobe, born of the royal house of Phrygia, had boastfully compared the greater number of her own offspring with those of Leto, Apollo&#x27;s and Artemis&#x27; mother: a classic example of &quot;hubris&quot;.

== Names ==
The number of Niobids mentioned most usually numbered twelve (Homer) or fourteen (Euripides and Apollodorus), but other sources mention twenty, four (Herodotus), or eighteen (Sappho). Generally half these children were sons, the other half daughters. The names of some of the children are mentioned; these lists vary by author:

Other different names were also mentioned, including Amaleus, Amyclas and Meliboea (also in Apollodorus, see below).

Manto, the seeress daughter of Tiresias, overheard Niobe&#x27;s remark and bid the Theban women placate Leto, in vain. Apollo and Artemis slew all the children of Niobe with their arrows, Apollo shooting the sons, Artemis the daughters. According to some sources, however, two of the Niobids who had supplicated Leto were spared: Apollodorus gives their names as Meliboea (Chloris) and Amyclas. Another apparent survivor is Phylomache, who is mentioned by Apollodorus as one of the two possible spouses of Pelias.

The Niobids were buried by the gods at Thebes. Ovid remarked that all men mourned Amphion, for the extinction of his line, but none mourned Niobe save her brother Pelops.

==Parthenius variant==
In another version of the myth, the Niobids are the children of Philottus and Niobe, daughter of Assaon. When Niobe dares to argue with Leto about the beauty of her children, Leto comes up with multi-stage punishment. First, Philottus is killed while hunting. Then, her father Assaon makes advances to his own daughter, which she refuses. He invites her children to a banquet and burns them all to death. As a result of these calamities, Niobe flings herself from a rock. Assaon, reflecting over his crimes, also killed himself.

==Art==
Due to their appearance in the mythology of Apollo, male and female Niobids frequently appeared in classical art. One of the two ivory reliefs added to the doors of the Temple of Apollo Palatinus in its Augustan rebuild depicted their death. They are also known from figurative sculpture, examples of which are to be found at the Palazzo Massimo in Rome and in the group of Niobids (including Niobe sheltering one of her daughters) found in Rome in 1583 along with the &quot;Wrestlers&quot; and brought to the Uffizi in Florence in 1775.

A terracotta figurine of Astycrateia is shown in the MAK Collection Online. A 3D-model of the same figurine was published on sketchfab.

In the best-known version of the story, the favorite companion of Cyparissus was a tamed stag, which he accidentally killed with his hunting javelin as it lay sleeping in the woods. The boy&#x27;s grief was such that it transformed him into a cypress tree, a classical symbol of mourning. The myth is thus aetiological in explaining the relation of the tree to its cultural significance. The subject is mainly known from Hellenized Latin literature and frescoes from Pompeii. No Greek hero cult devoted to Cyparissus has been identified.

== Family ==
According to the grammarian Servius (4th and 5th centuries AD), Cyparissus was the son of Telephus, and thus the grandson of Heracles.

== Mythology ==

===As initiation myth===

The myth of Cyparissus, like that of Hyacinthus, has often been interpreted as reflecting the social custom of pederasty in ancient Greece, with the boy the beloved &quot;(eromenos)&quot; of Apollo. Pederastic myth represents the process of initiation into adult male life, with a &quot;death&quot; and transfiguration for the &quot;eromenos.&quot; &quot;In all these tales,&quot; notes Karl Kerenyi, &quot;the beautiful boys are doubles of [Apollo] himself.&quot;

The stag as a gift from Apollo reflects the custom in Archaic Greek society of the older male &quot;(erastēs)&quot; giving his beloved an animal, an act often alluded to in vase painting. In the initiatory context, the hunt is a supervised preparation for the manly arts of war and a testing ground for behavior, with the stag embodying the gift of the hunter&#x27;s prey.

Similarly, the myth was used to explain the connection of the cypress tree to mourning and sorrow. Forbes-Irving has argued that the cypress as tree of mourning was mostly a Roman tradition, with little evidence of it playing such a role in Greek society. It is possible however that the earlier Greek source of Cyparissus&#x27;s myth diverged significantly from the surviving later ones, and was originally used to explain the connection of the cypress to Apollo specifically.

===Ovid&#x27;s version===
 The tameness of the deer may be the invention of the Augustan poet Ovid, and a late literary reversal of the boy&#x27;s traditional role. Ovid&#x27;s Cyparissus is so grief-stricken at accidentally killing his pet that he asks Apollo to let his tears fall forever. The god then turns the boy into a cypress tree (Latin: &quot;cupressus&quot;), whose sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.

Ovid frames the tale within the story of Orpheus, whose failure to retrieve his bride Eurydice from the underworld causes him to forsake the love of women in favor of that of boys. When Orpheus plays his lyre, even the trees are moved by the music; in the famous cavalcade of trees that ensues, the position of the cypress at the end prompts a transition to the metamorphosis of Cyparissus.

=== The commentaries of Servius and the Vatican Mythographer ===
According to one of the Vatican Mythographers, another Roman tradition makes the lover out to be the woodland god Silvanus. An invocation by Virgil of &quot;Silvanus who bears the slender cypress uprooted&quot; was explained in the commentary of Servius as alluding to a love affair. In his brief account, Servius differs from Ovid mainly in substituting Silvanus for Apollo, but also changes the gender of the deer and makes the god responsible for its death:
Silvanus loved a boy &quot;(puer)&quot; named Cyparissus who had a tame deer. When Silvanus unintentionally killed her, the boy was consumed by sorrow. The lover-god turned him into the tree that has his name, which he is said to carry as a consolation.
It is unclear whether Servius is inventing an &quot;aition&quot;, a story to explain why Silvanus was depicted holding an evergreen bough, or recording an otherwise unknown version. Elsewhere, Servius mentions a version in which the lover of Cyparissus was Zephyrus, the West Wind. The cypress, he notes, was associated with the underworld, either because they don&#x27;t grow back when pruned too severely, or because in Attica households in mourning are garlanded with cypress.

=== Cyparissus in Phocis===
According to a different tradition, a Cyparissus, possibly not the same figure, was the son of Minyas, and the mythical founder of Cyparissus (Kyparissos) in Phocis, which later was called Anticyra.

==In botany==
The word &quot;Cupressus&quot; was used to describe a genus of cypress trees; this genus was first described in the 18th century by the Swedish biologist Linnaeus. In modern times there is a taxonomic debate regarding which species should be retained in the genus &quot;Cupressus&quot;.

<doc id="78976" wikidata="Q916442" url="?curid=78976" title="Telephus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Telephus (; , &quot;Tēlephos&quot;, &quot;far-shining&quot;) was the son of Heracles and Auge, who was the daughter of king Aleus of Tegea. He was adopted by Teuthras, the king of Mysia, in Asia Minor, whom he succeeded as king. Telephus was wounded by Achilles when the Achaeans came to his kingdom on their way to sack Troy and bring Helen back to Sparta, and later healed by Achilles. He was the father of Eurypylus, who fought alongside the Trojans against the Greeks in the Trojan War. Telephus&#x27; story was popular in ancient Greek and Roman iconography and tragedy. Telephus&#x27; name and mythology were possibly derived from the Hittite god Telepinu.

==Birth to adulthood==
===Summary===
Telephus&#x27; mother was Auge, the daughter of Aleus, the king of Tegea, a city in Arcadia, in the Peloponnese of mainland Greece. His father was Heracles, who had seduced or raped Auge, a priestess of Athena. When Aleus found out, he tried to dispose of mother and child, but eventually both ended up in Asia Minor at the court of Teuthras, king of Mysia, where Telephus was adopted as the childless king&#x27;s heir.

There were three versions of how Telephus, the son of an Arcadian princess, came to be the heir of a Mysian king. In the oldest extant account, Auge goes to Mysia, is raised as a daughter by Teuthras, and Telephus is born there. In some accounts Telephus arrives in Mysia as an infant with his mother, where Teuthras marries Auge, and adopts Telephus. In others, while Auge (in various ways) is delivered to the Mysian court where she again becomes wife to the king, Telephus is instead left behind in Arcadia, having been abandoned on Mount Parthenion, either by Aleus, or by Auge when she gave birth while being taken to the sea by Nauplius to be drowned. However Telephus is suckled by a deer found and raised by King Corythus, or his herdsmen. Seeking knowledge of his mother, Telephus consulted the Delphic oracle which directed him to Mysia, where he was reunited with Auge and adopted by Teuthras.

===Sources===

A surviving fragment of the Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot; (sixth century BC), representing perhaps the oldest tradition, places Telephus&#x27; birth in Mysia. In this telling Telephus&#x27; mother Auge had been received at the court of Teuthras in Mysia (possibly at the command of the gods) and raised by him as a daughter. And it is in Mysia that Heracles, while seeking the horses of Laomedon, fathers Telephus.

All other surviving sources have Telephus born in Arcadia. The oldest such account (c. 490–480 BC), by the historian and geographer Hecataeus, says that Heracles used to have sex with Auge whenever he came to Tegea. We are told this by the second-century traveler Pausanias, who goes on to say, perhaps drawing upon Hecataeus, that when Aleus discovered that Auge had given birth to Telephus, he had mother and child shut up in a wooden chest and cast adrift on the open sea. The chest made its way from Arcadia to the Caicus river plain in Asia Minor, where the local king Teuthras married Auge.

Sophocles, in the fifth century BC, wrote a tragedy &quot;Aleadae&quot; (&quot;The sons of Aleus&quot;), which apparently told the circumstances of Telephus&#x27; birth. The play is lost and only fragments now remain, but a declamation attributed to the fourth-century BC orator Alcidamas probably used Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Aleadae&quot; for one of its sources. According to Alcidamas, Auge&#x27;s father Aleus had been warned by the Delphic oracle that if Auge had a son, then this grandson would kill Aleus&#x27; sons, so Aleus made Auge a priestess of Athena, telling her she must remain a virgin, on pain of death. But Heracles passing through Tegea, being entertained by Aleus in the temple of Athena, became enamored of Auge and while drunk had sex with her. Aleus discovered that Auge was pregnant and gave her to Nauplius to be drowned. But, on the way to the sea, Auge gave birth to Telephus on Mount Parthenion, and according to Alcidamas, Nauplius, ignoring his orders, sold mother and child to the childless Mysian king Teuthras, who married Auge and adopted Telephus, and &quot;later gave him to Priam to be educated at Troy&quot;. Alcidamas&#x27; version of the story must have diverged from Sophocles in at least this last respect. For, rather than the infant Telephus being sold to Teuthras, as in Alcidamas, an &quot;Aleadae &quot; fragment seems to insure that in the Sophoclean play, as in many later accounts (see above), the new-born Telephus was instead abandoned (on Mount Parthenion?), where he is suckled by a deer.
Euripides wrote a play &quot;Auge&quot; (408 BC?) which also dealt with Telephus&#x27; birth. The play is lost, but a summary of the plot can be pieced together from various later sources, in particular a narrative summary, given by the Armenian historian Moses of Chorene. A drunken Heracles, during a festival of Athena, rapes &quot;Athena&#x27;s priestess Auge, daughter of Aleus, as she conducted the dances during the nocturnal rites.&quot; Auge gives birth secretly in Athena&#x27;s temple at Tegea, and hides the new-born Telephus there. The child is discovered, and Aleus orders Telephus exposed and Auge drowned, but Heracles returns and apparently saves the pair from immediate death, and the play perhaps ended with the assurance (from Athena to Heracles?) that Auge and Telephus would be wife and son to Teuthras.

Strabo, gives a version of the story similar to Pausanias&#x27;, saying that, after discovering &quot;her ruin by Heracles&quot;, Aleus put Auge and Telephus into a chest and cast it into the sea, that it washed up at the mouth of the Caicus, and that Teuthras married Auge, and adopted Telephus.

Later accounts by the first-century BC Historian Diodorus Siculus and the 1st or second-century AD mythographer Apollodorus provide additional details and variations. Diodorus, as in Alcidamas&#x27; account, says that Aleus gave the pregnant Auge to Nauplius to be drowned, that she gave birth to Telephus near Mount Parthenion, and that she ended up with Teuthras in Mysia. But in Diodorus&#x27; account, instead of being sold, along with his mother, to Teuthras, Telephus is abandoned by Auge &quot;in some bushes&quot;, where he is suckled by a doe, and found by herdsmen. They give him to their king Corythus, who raises Telephus as his son. When Telephus grows up, wishing to find his mother, he consults the oracle at Delphi, which sends him to king Teuthras in Mysia. There he finds Auge and, as before, is adopted by the childless king, and made his heir. Apollodorus, as in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Auge&quot;, says that Auge delivered Telephus secretly in Athena&#x27;s temple, and hid him there. Apollodorus adds that an ensuing famine, was declared by an oracle to be the result of some impiety in the temple, and a search of the temple caused Telephus to be found. Aleus had Telephus exposed on Parthenion, where as in Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Aleadae&quot;, he is suckled by a doe. According to Apollodorus, he was found and raised by herdsman. As in Diodorus&#x27; account, Telephus consults the oracle at Delphi, is sent to Mysia, where he becomes the adopted heir of Teuthras.

According to the mythographer Hyginus (whose account is apparently taken from an older tragic source, probably Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Mysians&quot;), after Auge abandoned Telephus on Mount Parthenion she fled to Mysia where, as in the &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, she became the adopted daughter (not wife) of Teuthras. When Telephus goes to Mysia on the instruction of the oracle, Teuthras promises him his kingdom and his daughter Auge in marriage if he would defeat his enemy Idas. This Telephus did, with the help of Parthenopeus, a childhood companion who had been found as a baby on Mount Parthenion at the same time as Telephus, and was raised together with him. Teuthras then gave Auge to Telephus, but Auge still faithful to Heracles, attacked Telephus with a sword in their wedding chamber, but the gods intervened sending a serpent to separate them, causing Auge to drop her sword. Just as Telephus was about to kill Auge, she called out to Heracles for rescue and Telephus then recognized his mother.

==The silence of Telephus==
Presumably Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Aleadae&quot; (&quot;The Sons of Aleus&quot;) told how Telephus, while still in Arcadia, prior to going to Mysia in search of his mother, killed Aleus&#x27; sons, thereby fulfilling the oracle. Ancient sources confirm the killing, however virtually nothing is known of how this may have come about.

The murder of his uncles would have caused Telephus to become religiously polluted, and in need of purification,
and apparently, Greek religious practice required criminal homicides to remain silent until their blood-guilt could be expiated. Aristotle in the &quot;Poetics&quot;, in a reference to Telephus&#x27; appearance in a tragedy called &quot;Mysians&quot;, mentions &quot;the man who came from Tegea to Mysia without speaking&quot;. And indeed, the silence of Telephus was apparently &quot;proverbial&quot;. The comic poet Alexis writes about a voracious dinner guest who like &quot;Telephus in speechless silence sits, / Making but signs to those who ask him questions&quot;, presumably too intent on eating to converse. And another comic poet Amphis, complains about fishmongers who &quot;mute they stand like Telephus&quot;, going on to say that the comparison of the fishmongers to Telephus is apt since &quot;they all are homicides&quot;.

==King in Mysia==
===Summary===
====Attacked by the Greeks====

Telephus was made the heir of Teuthras&#x27; kingdom of Teuthrania in Mysia, and eventually succeeded Teuthras as its king. During Telephus&#x27; reign, in a prelude to the Trojan War, the Greeks attacked Telephus&#x27; city mistaking it for Troy. Telephus routed the Greeks, killing Thersander, son of Polynices, and forcing the Greeks back to their ships.

But Telephus was tripped by a vine and wounded in the thigh by Achilles&#x27; spear. According to Apollodorus, and a scholiast on Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Telephus was tripped while fleeing from Achilles&#x27; attack. The scholiast says that Dionysus caused the vine to trip Telephus because Telephus had failed to properly honor him. Dionysus&#x27; involvement is attested by a late sixth-century or early fifth-century BC red-figure calyx krater. Philostratus and Dictys Cretensis give detailed elaborations of all these events.

====Wound and healing====
The Mysians were victorious, and the Greeks returned home, but Telephus&#x27; wound would not heal. Telephus consulted the oracle of Apollo which gave the famous reply ὁ τρώσας ἰάσεται (&quot;your assailant will heal you&quot;). So Telephus went to Argos to seek a cure, and there was healed by Achilles. In return Telephus agreed to guide the Greeks to Troy. Apollodorus and Hyginus tell us that rust scraped from Achilles&#x27; spear was the healing agent. The healing of Telephus was a frequent theme in Augustan age and later Roman poetry. The &quot;Pharmacologia&quot; of John Ayrton Paris identifies verdigris, which has medicinal properties, as the healing rust of the spear. 

===Sources===
There is no mention of the battle in Mysia in the &quot;Iliad&quot; or the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.
However, the &quot;Cypria&quot; (late seventh century BC?), one of the poems of the Epic Cycle, told the story. According to Proclus&#x27; summary of the &quot;Cypria&quot;, the Greeks mistook Mysia for Troy, Telephus killed Thersander, but was wounded by Achilles. Telephus, guided by an oracle, came to Argos, where Achilles cured him in return for Telephus guiding the Greeks to Troy. Pindar (c. 522–443 BC), knew the story of Telephus&#x27; wounding by Achilles, presumably after being tripped by a vine: &quot;Achilles, who stained the vine-covered plain of Mysia, spattering it with the dark blood of Telephus&quot;.
Each of the three tragedians, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides wrote plays, all now lost, telling Telephus&#x27; story. Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Telephus&quot; (438 BC), dramatized Telephus&#x27; trip to Argos seeking a cure for his festering wound. In Euripides&#x27; account, Telephus disguised himself as a beggar dressed in rags. After his disguise was revealed, Telephus seized the Greek king Agamemnon&#x27;s infant son Orestes to use as a hostage. But it was discovered that Telephus was a Greek by birth, and Telephus agreed to guide the Greek army to Troy, in return for Achilles&#x27; healing his wound. Orestes being held hostage by Telephus was already being illustrated on red-figure pottery possibly as early as the second quarter of the fifth century, and the scene perhaps also appeared previously in Aeschylus&#x27; presentation of the story.

An Etruscan mirror, from the second half of the fourth century BC (Berlin, Antikensammlung Fr. 35) and a bas-relief (c. first century BC) from Herculaneum (Naples, National Archaeological Museum 6591) are interpreted as depicting Achilles healing Telephus with rust from his spear. Pliny the Elder (first-century AD) describes paintings (undated) which depicted Achilles scraping rust from his spear into the wound of Telephus. One such painting was perhaps attributed by tradition to the fifth-century BC Athenian painter Parrhasius. The first literary references to the use of rust scraped from Achilles&#x27; spear as the healing agent for Telephus&#x27; wound are found in the first-century BC Roman poets Propertius and Ovid.

Apollodorus gives a version of the Mysian expedition, probably drawn directly from the &quot;Cypria&quot;. Apollodorus&#x27; account agrees with Proclus&#x27; summary, but gives more of the story. Telephus killed many Greeks in addition to Thersander, but was tripped by a vine while fleeing from Achilles. Apollo told Telephus that his wound &quot;would be cured when the one who wounded him should turn physician&quot;. So Telephus went to Argos &quot;clad in rags&quot; (as in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Telephus&quot;) and, promising to guide the Greeks to Troy, begged Achilles to cure him, which Achilles did by using rust scraped from his spear. Telephus then showed the Greeks the way to Troy. The A scholia on &quot;Iliad&quot; 1.59, agrees with Proclus&#x27; and Apollodorus&#x27; accounts, but attributes the vine-tripping to Dionysus, angry because of unpaid honors, and adds that in addition to leading the Greeks to Troy, Telephus also agreed not to aid the Trojans in the coming war.

Hyginus&#x27; account seems to be based, in part at least, on one or more of the tragedians&#x27; lost plays. Hyginus tells of the wound inflicted by Achilles&#x27; spear, the wound&#x27;s festering, and Telephus&#x27; consulting of the Apollo&#x27;s oracle, with the answer that &quot;the only thing that could cure him was the very same spear by which he had been wounded.&quot; So Telephus sought out Agamemnon, and on the advice of Agamemnon&#x27;s wife Clytemnestra, Telephus snatched their infant son Orestes from his cradle, and threatened to kill the child unless his wound was healed. As the Greeks had also received an oracle saying that they would not be able to take Troy without Telephus&#x27; aid, they asked Achilles to heal Telephus. When Achilles protested he did not know anything about medicine, Odysseus pointed out that Apollo did not mean Achilles, but that the spear itself would be the cure. So they scraped rust from the spear into the wound, and Telephus was cured. The Greeks then asked Telephus to join them in sacking Troy, but Telephus refused because his wife Laodice was the daughter of Priam, the king of Troy. However, Telephus did promise to be the Greeks&#x27; guide to Troy.

==Wives and offspring==
The earliest mention of Telephus, which occurs in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; (c. eighth century BC), says that Telephus had a son Eurypylus, who died at Troy. Nothing is said there about who Eurypylus&#x27; mother was, but all ancient sources that do mention Eurypylus&#x27; mother say that she was Astyoche, who was (usually) Priam&#x27;s sister. Eurypylus led a large force of Mysians to fight on the side of Troy during the final stages of the Trojan War. Eurypylus was a great warrior, and killed many opponents, including Machaon and Nireus, but was finally killed by Achilles&#x27; son Neoptolemus. The irony of Achilles&#x27; son killing Telephus&#x27; son using the same spear that Achilles had used to both wound and heal Telephus, apparently figured in Sophocles&#x27; lost play &quot;Eurypylus&quot;. According to Servius, Eurypylus had a son, Grynus, who became king in Mysia and was known as the eponym of Gryneion and the founder of Pergamon.
Three other wives are given for Telephus, with no mention of offspring. According to Hyginus (as mentioned above) Telephus&#x27; wife was Priam&#x27;s daughter Laodice. According to Diodorus Siculus, Telephus married Agriope a daughter of Teuthras. While Philostratus says that Hiera, the leader of a contingent of Mysian women cavalry, killed in battle by Nireus, was the wife of Telephus. The Amazon-like Hiera had already been portrayed, on horseback, leading the Mysian women into battle, on the second-century BC Telephus frieze of the Pergamon Altar.

Three other offspring of Telephus are given which link Telephus with Italian myths. In Lycophron&#x27;s &quot;Alexandra&quot;, the legendary founders of the Etruscan Dodecapolis, Tarchon and Tyrensus (also spelled Tyrrhenus) are the sons of Telephus. That Tyrrhenus was said to be the son of Telephus is also reported by Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Neither Lycophron nor Dionysius mention the name of their mother, although apparently according to some, their mother was Hiera. Plutarch says that, according to one account, Telephus was the father of a daughter, Roma, from whom the city of Rome took its name.

==Iconography==

Over a hundred entries for Telephus are cataloged in the &quot;Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae&quot; (&quot;LIMC&quot;). Most representations associated with Telephus are late, with only a few earlier than the fourth century BC. Early examples include Attic red-figure pottery from as early as c. 510 BC, and East-Ionian engraved gems (c. 480 BC). Scenes showing Telephus suckled by a deer or holding Orestes hostage were particularly popular. Other scenes include either his wounding or his healing by Achilles. The most complete single account of the life of Telephus is depicted in the first-century BC Telephus frieze.

===Telephus frieze===
The Telephus frieze (between 180 and 156 BC) formed part of the decoration of the Pergamon Altar. The frieze adorned the inside walls of the colonnade that surrounded the raised interior court containing the sacrificial altar. It was nearly 60 meters in length, and was composed of around 74 marble panels each 1.58 meters high, of which 47 panels are completely or partially preserved.

The panels depict scenes from the life of Telephus, from events preceding his birth, to perhaps his death and heroizing. Panels have been interpreted as showing Heracles&#x27; first glimpse of Auge in an oak grove (panel 3); carpenters building the vessel in which Auge will be cast into the sea (panels 5–6); Teuthras finding Auge on the shore in Mysia (panel 10); Heracles discovering the abandoned Telephus being suckled by a lioness (panel 12); Telephus receiving arms from Auge, and leaving for the war against Idas (panels 16–18); Teuthras giving Auge to Telephus in marriage (panel 20); and Auge and Telephus, being startled by a serpent, and recognizing each other on their wedding night (panel 21). The next several panels have been interpreted as depicting the battle between the Mysians and the Greeks on the Caicus plain, including Hiera, Telephus&#x27; Amazon-like wife, leading a group of Mysian women cavalry into battle (panels 22–24) and Achilles, aided by Dionysus, wounding Telephus (panels 30–31). Scenes follow which have been interpreted as showing Telephus consulting the oracle of Apollo regarding the healing of his wound (panel 1); Telephus arriving at Argos, seeking a cure for his wound (panels 34–35); his welcome there (panels 36–38); a banquet at Argos during which Telephus&#x27; identity is revealed (panels 39–40); Telephus threatening the infant Orestes at an altar (panel 42); and presumably his healing by Achilles. Two final panels perhaps depict Telephus&#x27; death and heroizing (panels 47–48).

===Suckled by a deer ===
The abandoned Telephus being suckled by a deer was a frequent iconographic motif. Except for the Telephus frieze, which depicts the abandoned Telephus being suckled by a lioness, every other depiction of this event shows Telephus suckled by a deer. The earliest such representations occur on East-Ionian engraved gems (c. 480 BC), depicting the infant Telephus keeling or crawling under a standing deer, grasping the deer&#x27;s teats. Nearly identical scenes appears on Tegeatic coins from about 370 BC. Pausanias reports seeing an image of Telephus suckled by a deer on Mount Helicon in Boeotia. Representations showing Heracles finding Telephus with a deer are also frequent from the first century AD. The scene continued to be popular through the third century AD.

===Wounded by Achilles===
A late sixth-century or early fifth-century Attic fragmentary red-figure calyx krater, attributed to Phintias (St. Petersburg, State Hermitage Museum ST1275) apparently depicted the battle between Telephus and Achilles. Fragments show Patroclus, and a bent over Diomedes (both named), part of a thyrsos, and the inscription &quot;Dionysos&quot;. It is presumed that Diomedes is attending to the fallen Thersander, and that the central part of the vase depicted Achilles wounding Telephus, with the aid of the god Dionysus.

According to Pausanias, the battle between the Telephus and Achilles at the Caicus river was also depicted on the West pediment of the Temple of Athena Alea at Tegea (finished c. 350–340 BC). Only fragments remain of the West pediment, which indicate that Telephus perhaps wore the lion-skin of his father Heracles. Inscriptions show that Telephus and Auge were represented on the metopes of the temple, and Pausanias also mentions seeing a portrait painting of Auge there.

===At Agamemnon&#x27;s altar===

Telephus&#x27; taking refuge at Agamemnon&#x27;s altar, usually with Orestes as hostage, was also a frequent motif. Attic vase painting depicts the scene, often with either Agamemnon, or Clytemnestra, also present. Perhaps the earliest example, an Attic kylix cup (c. 470 BC) from Eastern Etruria (MFA 98.931) shows Telephus, with bandaged thigh, sitting alone on an altar holding two spears. An Attic pelike (c. 450 BC), from Vulci (British Museum E 382) shows Telephus, with bandaged thigh, sitting on an altar, holding a spear in his right hand, and the infant Orestes with his left arm. From the left, Agamemnon confronts Telephus, with spear. Later Italic treatments of the scene usually include both Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, often with Clytemnestra or sometimes Odysseus restraining Agamemnon from attacking Telephus.

===Healed by Achilles===
The healing of Telephus was, according to tradition, depicted by the fifth-century BC Athenian painter Parrhasius. An engraved Etruscan bronze mirror, from the second half of the fourth century BC (Berlin, Antikensammlung Fr. 35) and a marble bas-relief, c. first century BC, from Herculaneum (Naples, National Archaeological Museum 6591) show Achilles healing Telephus with rust from his spear.

==Tragic tradition==

Telephus was a popular tragic hero, whose family history figured in several Greek tragedies. Aristotle writes that &quot;the best tragedies are written about a few families—Alcmaeon for instance and Oedipus and Orestes and Meleager and Thyestes and Telephus.&quot; All of these plays about Telephus are now lost. We know of them only through preserved fragments, and the reports of other ancient writers. Each of the three great tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides wrote multiple plays which featured the story.

Aeschylus wrote a play called &quot;Mysians&quot; which perhaps told the story of Telephus coming to Mysia and seeking purification for having killed his maternal uncles. Aeschylus wrote another play &quot;Telephus&quot; thought to be a sequel to &quot;Mysians&quot;, in which Telephus comes to Argos seeking the healing of his wound, and perhaps also included Telephus&#x27; seizure of Orestes as hostage.

Sophocles probably wrote at least four plays: &quot;Aleadae&quot; (&quot;The Sons of Aleus&quot;), &quot;Mysians&quot;, &quot;Telephus&quot;, and &quot;Eurypylus&quot;, involving Telephus and his family. A fifth play &quot;The Gathering of the Achaeans&quot; possibly also involved Telephus. A fourth-century BC inscription mentions a &quot;Telepheia&quot; by Sophocles, which may refer to a trilogy or tetralogy on Telephus, perhaps including one or more of these plays. &quot;The Sons of Aleus&quot; presumably told the story of Telephus&#x27; killing his uncles, and thus fulfilling the oracle (see above). Fragments suggest a quarrel over Telephus&#x27; illegitimate birth, which perhaps resulted in the killings. &quot;Mysians&quot; and &quot;Telephus&quot; are presumed to continue the story of Telephus, after his arrival as an adult in Mysia. Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Eurypylus&quot; apparently told the story of Tellephus&#x27; son Eurypylus, killed at Troy by Achilles son Neoptolemus. The irony of Achilles&#x27; son, killing Telephus&#x27; son, using the same spear that Achilles had used to heal Telephus, apparently also figured in the tragedy.

Euripides wrote a play &quot;Auge&quot; (see above) which told the circumstances of Telephus&#x27; birth. His mother Auge having been raped by a drunken Heracles, the infant Telephus is found in Athena&#x27;s temple, ordered put to death, but saved by Heracles. Euripides, like Aeschylus and Sophocles, also wrote a play entitled &quot;Telephus&quot;. Euripides&#x27; &quot;Telephus&quot; (see above) famously told the story of Telephus going to Argos disguised as a beggar where, after taking Orestes as hostage, he agreed to guide the Greeks to Troy in return for the healing of his wound.

A measure of the fame of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Telephus&quot; can be inferred from two comedies of Aristophanes (c. 446 – c. 386 BC), which extensively parodied the play. In the &quot;Acharnians&quot;, the comic hero of the play, Dicaeopolis, modelled on the Euripidean Telephus, takes as hostage a charcoal basket, and borrows Telephus&#x27; beggar costume from Euripides (who appears as a character in the play), to wear as a disguise. In &quot;Women at the Thesmophoria&quot;, a kinsman of Euripides (who again is a character in the play), disguises himself (as a women). When he is exposed, he grabs an infant (which turns out to be a disguised wineskin) as hostage, and takes refuge at a sacrificial altar.

Several later tragic poets apparently also wrote plays on the subject. The late fifth-century poet Agathon, (probably the most well known tragedian after Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides) wrote plays with titles &quot;Mysians&quot; and &quot;Telephus&quot;. Another late fifth-century poet Iophon, and the fourth-century poets Cleophon and Moschion, each wrote plays called &quot;Telephus&quot;. The fourth-century poet Aphareus wrote an &quot;Auge&quot;, and the Hellenistic Nicomachus of Alexandria in Troas wrote a &quot;Mysians&quot;.

The Roman poets Ennius (c. 239–169 BC), and Accius (170–c. 86 BC) also wrote plays called &quot;Telephus&quot;.

==Pergamon==
Telephus was considered to be the mythical founder of Pergamon, as well as the ancestor of the Attalids, Pergamon&#x27;s ruling dynasty (from 241 BC). As early as a Milesian inscription (after 129 BC), the people of Pergamon were called Telephidai, descendants of Telephus. According to Pausanias, the Pergamon people claimed to be descendants of the Arcadians who had come with Telephus to Mysia. Inscriptions record the association between Pergamon and Tegea, and the most important cult of Pergamon, the cult of Athena, was said to have been brought from Tegea, and established at Pergamon by Auge.

Their claimed descent from the hero Telephos, as prominently proclaimed by the Telephus frieze, was used by the Attalids to legitimize their claim to sovereignty, and to establish Pergamon&#x27;s Greek heritage. Telephus was the object of ritual hero worship at Pergamon. According to Pausanias, the Pergamenes sung hymns and made offerings to Telephus.

==Cult==
As noted above, Telephus was the object of cult hero worship at Pergamon. Telephus was also worshipped on Mount Parthenion in Arcadia, and honored at Tegea, where he was shown on the pediment of the Temple of Athena Alea at Tegea, fighting Achilles.

<text>In Greek mythology, Peneus (; Greek: Πηνειός) was a Thessalian river god, one of the three thousand Rivers, a child of Oceanus and Tethys.

== Family ==
The nymph Creusa bore him one son, Hypseus, who was King of the Lapiths, and three daughters, Menippe (mother of Phrastor by Pelasgus), Daphne and Stilbe. Some sources state that he was the father of Cyrene, alternately known as his granddaughter through Hypseus. Daphne, in an Arcadian version of the myth, was instead the daughter of the river god Ladon.

Peneus also had a son Atrax with Bura, and Andreus with an unknown consort. Tricce (or Tricca), eponym of the city Tricca, was mentioned as his daughter. In later accounts, Peneus was credited to be the father of Chrysogenia who consorted with Zeus and became the mother of Thissaeus. Meanwhile, his daughter Astabe coupled with Hermes and became the parents of Astacus, father of Iocles, father of Hipponous. According to Hellanicus, Peneus was the father of Iphis, mother of Salmoneus by Aeolus the son of Hellen.

== Mythology ==
Eros shot Apollo with one of his arrows, causing him to fall in love with Daphne. It was Eros&#x27;s plan that Daphne would scorn Apollo because Eros was angry that Apollo had made fun of his archery skills. Eros also claimed to be irritated by Apollo&#x27;s singing. Daphne prayed to the river god Peneus to help her. He changed her into a laurel tree, which later became sacred to Apollo &quot;(see Apollo and Daphne)&quot;.

There are several versions of the myth in which she appears, but the general narrative, found in Greco-Roman mythology, is that due to a curse made by the fierce wrath of the god Cupid, son of Venus, on the god Apollo (Phoebus), she became the unwilling object of the infatuation of Apollo, who chased her against her wishes. Just before being kissed by him, Daphne invoked her river god father, who transformed her into a laurel tree, thus foiling Apollo.

Thenceforth Apollo developed a special reverence for laurel. At the Pythian Games, which were held every four years in Delphi in honour of Apollo, a wreath of laurel gathered from the Vale of Tempe in Thessaly was given as a prize. Hence it later became customary to award prizes in the form of laurel wreaths to victorious generals, athletes, poets and musicians, worn as a chaplet on the head. The Poet Laureate is a well-known modern example of such a prize-winner, dating from the early Renaissance in Italy. According to Pausanias the reason for this was &quot;simply and solely because the prevailing tradition has it that Apollo fell in love with the daughter of Ladon (Daphne)&quot;. Most artistic depictions of the myth focus on the moment of Daphne&#x27;s transformation.

== Family ==
Sources variously claim Daphne to have been a daughter of the (1) Thessalian river god Peneus by the nymph Creusa, or of (2) another Arcadian river-deity Ladon (Orontes) by Ge (Earth) and Stymphalis, or lastly, King Amyclas of Amyclae.
== Mythology ==
The earliest source of the myth of Daphne and Apollo is Phylarchus, quoted by Parthenius of Nicaea. Later, the Roman poet Ovid does a retelling of this Greek legend, which appears in his work &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

=== Ovid ===
The pursuit of a local nymph by an Olympian god, part of the archaic adjustment of religious cult in Greece, was given an arch anecdotal turn in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by the Roman poet Ovid (died AD 17). According to this version Apollo&#x27;s infatuation was caused by a golden-tipped arrow shot at him by Cupid, son of Venus, who wanted to punish Apollo for having insulted his archery skills by commenting &quot;What hast thou to do with the arms of men, thou wanton boy?&quot;, and to demonstrate the power of love&#x27;s arrow. Eros also shot Daphne, but with a leaden-tipped arrow, the effect of which was to make her flee from Apollo.

Elated with sudden love, Apollo chased Daphne continually. He tried to make her cease her flight by saying he did not wish to hurt her. When she kept fleeing, Apollo lamented that even though he had the knowledge of medicinal herbs, he had failed to cure himself from the wound of Cupid&#x27;s arrow. When Apollo finally caught up with her, Daphne prayed for help to her father, the river god Peneus of Thessaly, who immediately commenced her transformation into a laurel tree (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;):

a heavy numbness seized her limbs, thin bark closed over her breast, her hair turned into leaves, her arms into branches, her feet so swift a moment ago stuck fast in slow-growing roots, her face was lost in the canopy. Only her shining beauty was left.

Even this did not quench Apollo&#x27;s ardour, and as he embraced the tree, he felt her heart still beating. He then declared:

&quot;My bride,&quot; he said, &quot;since you can never be, at least, sweet laurel, you shall be my tree. My lure, my locks, my quiver you shall wreathe.&quot;

Upon hearing his words, Daphne bends her branches, unable to stop it.

=== Parthenius ===
A version of the attempt on Daphne&#x27;s sworn virginity that has been less familiar since the Renaissance was narrated by the Hellenistic poet Parthenius, in his &quot;Erotica Pathemata&quot;, &quot;The Sorrows of Love&quot;, which he attributes to Hellenistic historian Phylarchus. In this, which is the earliest written account, Daphne is a mortal girl, daughter of Amyclas, fond of hunting and determined to remain a virgin; she is pursued by the boy Leucippus (&quot;white stallion&quot;), who disguises himself in a girl&#x27;s outfit in order to join her band of huntresses. He is also successful in gaining her innocent affection. This makes Apollo angry and he puts it into the girl&#x27;s mind to stop to bathe in the river Ladon; there, as all strip naked, the ruse is revealed, as in the myth of Callisto, and the affronted huntresses plunge their spears into Leucippus. At this moment Apollo&#x27;s attention becomes engaged, and he begins his own pursuit. Daphne, fleeing to escape Apollo&#x27;s advances, prays to Zeus to help. Zeus turns her into laurel tree. Parthenius&#x27; modern editor remarks on the rather awkward transition, linking two narratives.

=== Pausanias ===
Parthenius&#x27; tale was known to Pausanias, who recounted it in his &quot;Description of Greece&quot; (2nd century AD). According to him, Leucippus was a son of the prince of Pisa, whose attempts to woo her by open courtship all failed, as Daphne avoided all males. Leucippus then thought of the following trick; he grew his hair and wore women&#x27;s clothes, and this way managed to get close to Daphne, to whom he introduced himself as a daughter of the prince. As he was the highest-ranking and best huntsman of Daphne&#x27;s company, he became good friends with her. Apollo, himself in love with Daphne too, was jealous of Leucippus&#x27; success in love, however Leucippus&#x27; ruse was soon discovered when the girls took a bath in a lake; they stripped a reluctant Leucippus naked, and upon discovering his true sex, killed him with javelins and daggers.

=== Hyginus ===
When Apollo pursued the virgin Daphne, who in Hyginus&#x27; version is a daughter of the river god Peneus, it was the earth goddess Gaia to whom she begged for protection. Gaia then received her, changing her into a laurel tree, while Apollo created a wreath with one of its branches.

=== Other authors ===
Philostratus in his &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot; says the Assyrians, who worshipped Apollo Daphnaeus (&quot;Apollo of the Laurel&quot;) place the site of Daphne&#x27;s transformation from Arcadia to Antioch (modern day Antakya in Turkey).

Nonnus also placed Daphne&#x27;s dwellings near the Orontes River, and says that it was Gaia who swallowed up the girl before she knew marriage; Apollo always blamed Gaia for this.

In his &quot;Dialogues of the Gods&quot;, satirical author Lucian of Samosata has Apollo call Daphne and Hyacinthus his two greatest loves, and regret losing them both; he declares himself unlucky in love, especially since Daphne found the option of becoming a tree more attractive than him. Eros also mentions to Zeus Daphne not falling for Apollo.

A sixth century AD poet, Dioscorus of Aphrodito, composed a poem where Apollo calls Daphne and Hyacinthus his two greatest loves, and mourns their loss.

== Laurel varieties ==
The name Daphne, in Greek Δάφνη, means &quot;laurel. While the story of Daphne is traditionally connected with the bay laurel (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;), almost 90 species of evergreen shrubs noted for their scented flowers and poisonous berries are grouped under the genus Daphne—including the garland flower (&quot;Daphne cneorum&quot;); the February Daphne or mezereon (&quot;Daphne mezereum&quot;); and spurge laurel or wood laurel (&quot;Daphne laureola&quot;). These species are in the family Thymelaeaceae and are native to Asia, Europe and North Africa.

== Temples ==
=== Artemis Daphnaia ===
Artemis Daphnaia, who had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi in antiquity, on the slopes of Mount Cnacadion near the Spartan frontier, had her own sacred laurel trees.

=== Apollo Daphnephoros, Eretria ===
At Eretria the identity of an excavated 7th- and 6th-century BCE temple to &quot;Apollo Daphnephoros&quot;, &quot;Apollo, laurel-bearer&quot;, or &quot;carrying off Daphne&quot;, a &quot;place where the citizens are to take the oath&quot;, is identified in inscriptions.
