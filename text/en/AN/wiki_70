<text>Santa Cruz (Spanish for &quot;Holy Cross&quot;) is the largest city and the county seat of Santa Cruz County, in Northern California. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 62,956. Situated on the northern edge of Monterey Bay, Santa Cruz is a popular tourist destination, owing to its beaches, surf culture, and historic landmarks.

Santa Cruz was founded by the Spanish in 1791, when Fermín de Lasuén established Mission Santa Cruz. Soon after, a settlement grew up near the mission called Branciforte, which came to be known across Alta California for its lawlessness. With the Mexican secularization of the Californian missions in 1833, the former mission was divided and granted as rancho grants. Following the American Conquest of California and the admission of California as a U. S. state in 1850, Santa Cruz was incorporated as a town in 1866, and became a charter city in 1876. The completion of the South Pacific Coast Railroad in 1880 and the creation of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk in 1904 solidified the city&#x27;s status as a seaside resort community, while the establishment of the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1965 made Santa Cruz a college town.

==History==

===Indigenous period===
Indigenous people have been living in the Santa Cruz region for at least 12,000 years. Prior to the arrival of Spanish soldiers, missionaries and colonists in the late 18th century, the area was home to the Awaswas nation of Ohlone people, who lived in a territory stretching slightly north of Davenport to Rio Del Mar. The Awaswas tribe was made up of no more than 1,000 people and their language is now extinct. The only remnants of their spoken language are three local place names: Aptos, Soquel and Zayante; and the name of a native shellfish – abalone. At the time of colonization, the Indigenous people belonged to the Uypi tribe of the &quot;Awaswas&quot;-speaking dialectical group. They called the area &quot;Aulinta&quot;.

===Spanish period===

The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portolá expedition led by Gaspar de Portolá, passed through the area on its way north, still searching for the &quot;port of Monterey&quot; described by Sebastian Vizcaino in 1602. The party forded the river (probably near where the Soquel Avenue bridge now stands) and camped nearby on October 17, 1769. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespí, traveling with the expedition, noted in his diary that, &quot;This river was named San Lorenzo.&quot; (for Saint Lawrence).

Next morning, the expedition set out again, and Crespi noted that, &quot;Five hundred steps after we started we crossed a good arroyo of running water which descends from some high hills where it rises. It was named &quot;El Arroyo de la Santísima Cruz, which translates literally as &quot;The Stream of the Most Holy Cross&quot;.

In 1791, Father Fermín Lasuén continued the use of Crespi&#x27;s name when he declared the establishment of &quot;La Misión de la Exaltación de la Santa Cruz&quot; (also known as Mission Santa Cruz) for the conversion of the Awaswas of Chatu-Mu and surrounding Ohlone villages. Santa Cruz was the twelfth mission to be founded in California. The creek, however, later lost the name, and is known today as Laurel Creek because it parallels Laurel Street. It is the main feeder of Neary Lagoon.

In 1797, Governor Diego de Borica, by order of the Viceroy of New Spain, Miguel de la Grúa Talamanca y Branciforte, marqués de Branciforte, established the &quot;Villa de Branciforte&quot;, a town named in honor of the Viceroy. One of only three civilian towns established in California during the Spanish colonial period (the other two became Los Angeles and San Jose), the Villa was located across the San Lorenzo River, less than a mile from the Mission. Its original main street is now North Branciforte Avenue. Villa de Branciforte later lost its civic status, and in 1905 the area was annexed into the City of Santa Cruz.

===Mexican period===

In the 1820s, newly independent Mexico assumed control of the area. Following the Mexican secularization act of 1833, governor Figueroa attempted to rename the community that had grown up around the mission after himself, to &quot;Pueblo de Figueroa&quot;. The pueblo designation was never made official, however. The new name did not catch on and Santa Cruz remained Santa Cruz.

The Santa Cruz mission, along with the rest of the twenty-one Alta California missions, was secularized within a few years after 1833. Even before secularization, the Native American population had declined. Following secularization, mission grazing lands, which once extended from the San Lorenzo River north along the coast to approximately today&#x27;s Santa Cruz County border, were taken away and broken up into large land grants called &quot;ranchos&quot;. The grants were made by several different governors between 1834 and 1845 (see List of Ranchos of California).

Two ranchos were totally within the boundaries of today&#x27;s city of Santa Cruz. Rancho Potrero Y Rincon de San Pedro Regalado consisted mostly of flat, river-bottom pasture land north of Mission Hill (&quot;potrero&quot; translates as &quot;pasture&quot;). Rancho Tres Ojos de Agua was on the west side. Three other rancho boundaries later became part of the modern city limits: Rancho Refugio on the west. Rancho Carbonera on the north, and Rancho Arroyo del Rodeo on the east.

After secularization put most California land into private hands, immigrants from the United States began to arrive in steadily increasing numbers, especially in the 1840s when overland routes like the California Trail were opened. In 1848, following the Mexican–American War, Mexico ceded the territory of Alta California to the U.S. in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

Demoted to a parish church, the former Santa Cruz mission was unable to maintain its building complex after secularization, and the adobe buildings slowly began to fall apart from wet weather and lack of maintenance. The chapel tower fell in 1840 and the entire front wall was destroyed in the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. In 1858 a &quot;modern&quot; church was built next door to the remaining rear portion of the chapel. That remainder was demolished in 1889, when today&#x27;s Holy Cross church was built on the site, in a gothic style.

=== American period===

California was the first portion of the former Mexican territory to become a state, in 1850. Santa Cruz County was established the same year, and Santa Cruz became the county seat. Santa Cruz was incorporated as a town in 1866, and became a charter city in 1876.

Following the U.S. Conquest of California, Santa Cruz steadily grew with the arrival of immigrants from the eastern United States. Elihu Anthony (1818–1905) arrived in Santa Cruz in 1847 and opened many firsts for the city, including the first Protestant Church and the first blacksmith foundry. He built the first wharf and was the first postmaster. He developed the first commercial blocks in downtown Santa Cruz with his early blacksmith foundry located at what is now the corner of Pacific Avenue and Mission Street. With Frederick A. Hihn, Anthony built the first private water supply network in the city and serving nearby communities.

The establishment of railroad lines in Santa Cruz in 1875–76 with the Santa Cruz &amp; Felton Railroad and the Santa Cruz Railroad provided market access for the city&#x27;s timber, leather and limestone industries.

California Powder Works began manufacturing blasting powder for California mining when normal supplies were interrupted by the American Civil War. The extensive complex built on the San Lorenzo River upstream of Santa Cruz used charcoal and powder kegs manufactured from local forests. The Works later manufactured smokeless powder used in United States Army Krag-Jørgensen rifles and guns of the United States Navy Pacific and Asiatic fleets.

Santa Cruz was hard hit by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that killed three people. It was also hit by ocean surges caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, wherein the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor sustained an estimated $10 million of damage, with another $5 million of damage to docked boats there. Following the earthquake, a former building chief urged the city government to consider relocating to a safer location with lower risk of damage from seismic activity. It was again hit by ocean surges caused by 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai eruption and tsunami, that caused damages to the harbor.

Santa Cruz became one of the first cities to approve marijuana for medicinal uses. In 1992, residents overwhelmingly approved Measure A, which allowed for the medicinal uses of marijuana. Santa Cruz was home to the second above-ground medical marijuana club in the world when the Santa Cruz Cannabis Buyers Club opened its doors in April 1995. Santa Cruz also became one of the first cities in California to test the state&#x27;s medical marijuana laws in court after the arrest of Valerie Corral and Mike Corral, founders of the Wo/Men&#x27;s Alliance for Medical Marijuana, by the DEA. In January 2020, Santa Cruz became the third city in the US and second city in California to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms in addition to a slew of other entheogenic plants on the Federal Schedule 1 Substance List.

In 1998, the Santa Cruz community declared itself a nuclear-free zone, and in 2003, the Santa Cruz City Council became the first city council in the U.S. to denounce the Iraq War. The City Council of Santa Cruz also issued a proclamation opposing the USA PATRIOT Act.

Notable feminist activists Nikki Craft and Ann Simonton resided in Santa Cruz, where they formed the &quot;Praying Mantis Brigade&quot;. This collection of activists organized the &quot;Myth California Pageant&quot; in the 1980s protesting the objectification of women. Myth California was staged concurrently with the Miss California pageant held in Santa Cruz since the 1920s. The protests ran for nine years and eventually contributed to the Miss California pageant leaving Santa Cruz. 

Riots occurred on May 1, 2010, sparked when anarchist extremists threw paint at police cars and painted anarchist symbols and anti-capitalist phrases onto buildings, resulting in more than a dozen buildings being vandalized and numerous storefronts being damaged. Property damages are estimated to top roughly $100,000. Prior to the riot, a May Day rally was being held for worker and immigrant rights. According to police, the rally was infiltrated by a local anarchist group, who used the rally as a cover for attacking corporate premises.

Occupy Santa Cruz formed as an autonomous organization in solidarity with the worldwide Occupy movement, a broad-based protest against economic and social inequality. The organization gained most of its notoriety when members barricaded themselves in an empty bank building owned by Wells Fargo and occupied the building for 72 hours, causing $30,000 in damages. Eleven criminal charges were filed, at least seven of which have since been dropped.

===Climate===
Santa Cruz has mild weather throughout the year, experiencing a warm-summer Mediterranean climate characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, mostly dry summers. Due to its proximity to Monterey Bay, fog and low overcast are common during the night and morning hours, especially in the summer. Santa Cruz frequently experiences an Indian summer, with the year&#x27;s warmest temperatures often occurring in the autumn. Since the city faces south rather than west with mountains to its north, temperatures are usually several degrees warmer than in coastal areas to its northwest.

===Historic landmarks===

By the 1860s, Pacific Avenue had become the main street of downtown Santa Cruz, and remains so today. Local architect Kermit Darrow and landscape architect Roy Rydell were engaged in 1969 to convert several blocks of Pacific Avenue into a semi-pedestrian street named the Pacific Garden Mall. The Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 destroyed nearly all of the 19th-century buildings in the downtown area. The Pacific Avenue Historic District had been recognized by the National Register of Historic Places; it was delisted in 1991. After the earthquake, the Pacific Garden Mall theme was eliminated, and an updated downtown design plan by ROMA Design Group was implemented. As of 2016, only one empty lot remains on Pacific Avenue from the destruction of the 1989 earthquake.

Landmarks on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Santa Cruz County, California include the Branciforte Adobe, the Cowell Lime Works Historic District, the Golden Gate Villa, the Hinds House, Mission Santa Cruz, the Neary-Rodriguez Adobe, the Octagon Building, and the Santa Cruz Looff Carousel and Roller Coaster, among others.

===&quot;Surf City&quot; nickname controversy===
After Huntington Beach, California, trademarked the &quot;Surf City USA&quot; name, Santa Cruz politicians tried to stop the mark from being registered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office because of a 10-year-old controversy over Santa Cruz&#x27;s nickname &quot;Surf City&quot;. Huntington Beach has obtained a total of seven registrations for the &quot;Surf City USA&quot; trademark. None of these registrations of the trademark are on the principal register, but on the secondary register, which means that Huntington Beach has no exclusive right to assert ownership over the &quot;Surf City USA&quot; trademark. Two Santa Cruz surf shops, Shoreline Surf Shop and Noland&#x27;s on the Wharf, sued the city of Huntington Beach in order to protect the public use of the term &quot;Surf City&quot;. The parties reached a confidential settlement in January 2008, in which neither side admitted liability and all claims and counterclaims were dismissed. The Santa Cruz surf shops continue to print T-shirts, and the Visitor&#x27;s Bureau retains the right to use the trademark.

===Transportation===
State Routes 1 and 17 are the main roads in and out of Santa Cruz, with the latter being the primary route north to San Jose and the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area. Geographically constrained between the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Monterey Bay, the narrow transportation corridor served by SR 1, California&#x27;s Pacific Coast Highway, suffers excessive congestion. The ramp from SR 1 northbound to SR 17 southbound, onto Ocean Street, is commonly known as the &quot;fish hook&quot; due to its tightening curve. A project to widen the highway and this interchange was begun in 2006 and completed in the fall of 2008.

The nearest airports served by major commercial airlines are San Jose International Airport, Monterey Regional Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and Oakland International Airport. The nearest public airport of any kind is Watsonville Municipal Airport, about eight miles to the southeast, which serves general aviation users.

Horsecars offered tram service from 1876, and the Santa Cruz, Garfield Park, and Capitola Electric Railroad began operations in 1881. The Union Traction Company consolidated three electric tram service routes in 1904. One line ran from DeLaveaga Park along Water Street and Pacific Avenue to the beach, another from Ocean Cliffs to downtown along what would become SR 1, and a line through Seabright to Capitola was completed in 1906. Competition from automobiles ended streetcar service in 1926. The Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District now provides bus service throughout Santa Cruz County.

Amtrak serves Santa Cruz via Amtrak Thruway from rail connections at Amtrak San Jose Diridon Train Station operated by the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District by way of a partnership with the Amtrak, &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot;, and Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. Other rail connections such as Altamont Corridor Express and Caltrain are also available at Amtrak&#x27;s San Jose passenger station.

Greyhound Lines bus service is another, albeit less commonly used, option for visiting Santa Cruz.

Santa Cruz has an extensive network of bike lanes and bike paths. Most major roads have bike lanes, and wide bike lanes were recently installed on Beach Street, near the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Additionally, there are levee bike paths along the San Lorenzo River. A Rail Trail – a bicycle and pedestrian path beside an existing coastal train track—is under consideration.

The Santa Cruz, Big Trees and Pacific Railway operates diesel-electric tourist trains between the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and Roaring Camp in Felton, through Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, with its famous Redwood Grove walking trail.

The Santa Cruz Railroad was a narrow gauge railroad that operated between Santa Cruz and Pajaro.

===Public safety===

A 2013 article in the &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; noted that according to FBI statistics, Santa Cruz had the highest property crime rates per capita for medium and large-sized cities in the state of California, in addition to some of the highest violent crime rates in the state of California for medium and large-sized cities. The article noted tourism, police staffing concerns, prolific liquor licenses, widespread availability of drugs, and large numbers of transients as potential causes. The 2019 edition of the FBI&#x27;s Uniform Crime Reports data published by the Santa Cruz Police Department showed that crime rates had decreased for all crimes except arson when measured against a five-year rolling average.

In 1973, after the discovery of four bodies in Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, Peter Chang, the district attorney for Santa Cruz County referred to the city as &quot;the murder capital of the world&quot; in an interview. The bodies were later determined to be victims of the serial killer Herbert Mullin.

<doc id="81729" wikidata="Q602258" url="?curid=81729" title="Melampus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Melampus (; , &quot;Melampous&quot;) was a legendary soothsayer and healer, originally of Pylos, who ruled at Argos. He was the introducer of the worship of Dionysus, according to Herodotus, who asserted that his powers as a seer were derived from the Egyptians and that he could understand the language of animals. A number of pseudepigraphal works of divination were circulated in Classical and Hellenistic times under the name Melampus. According to Herodotus and Pausanias (vi.17.6), on the authority of Hesiod, his father was Amythaon, whose name implies the &quot;ineffable&quot; or &quot;unspeakably great&quot;; thus Melampus and his heirs were &quot;Amythaides&quot; of the &quot;House of Amythaon&quot;. Maurice de Guérin made him one of the characters of the first Western prose poem, &quot;The Centaur&quot;, in 1835.

==Homer==
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, a digression concerning the lineage of Theoclymenus, &quot;a prophet, sprung from Melampus&#x27; line of seers&quot;, sketches the epic narrative concerning Melampus with such brevity that its details must have been familiar to Homer&#x27;s audience. With brief hints, a sequence of episodes is alluded to, in which we discern strife in Pylos between Melampus and Neleus, who usurps Melampus&#x27;s &quot;great high house&quot;, forcing him into heroic exile. Melampus spends a year as bondsman in the house of Phylacus, &quot;all for Neleus&#x27; daughter Pero&quot;. At his extremity, Melampus is visited by &quot;the mad spell a Fury, murderous spirit, cast upon his mind. But the seer worked free of death&quot; and succeeded at last in rustling Phylacus&#x27;s cattle back to Pylos, where he avenged himself on Neleus and gave Pero in marriage to his brother Bias. But Melampus&#x27;s own destiny lay in Argos, where he lived and ruled, married and sired a long line, also briefly sketched in Homer&#x27;s excursus.

==Later myths==
At a later date the narrative was embellished with anecdotal detail: Melampus lived in Pylos during the reign of Anaxagoras or possibly Proetus. The king offered a reward for anybody that could heal his son, who suffered from a strange malady. Melampus killed an ox and talked to the vultures that came to eat the corpse. They said that the last time they had had such a feast was when the king had made a sacrifice. They told Melampus that the prince had been frightened of the big, bloody knife and the king tossed it aside to calm the child. It had hit a tree and injured a hamadryad, who cursed the prince with the sickness. The hamadryad told Melampus that the boy would be healed if the knife was taken out of the trunk of the tree and boiled, then the prince should drink the rusty water that resulted. Melampus followed her directions and, as payment for the cure, demanded two thirds of the kingdom for himself, and one third for his brother, Bias. The king agreed.

In another version of Melampus&#x27; story, when the women of Argos were driven mad by Dionysus, in the reign of Anaxagoras or possibly Proetus, Melampus was brought in to cure them, but demanded a third of the kingdom as payment. The king refused, but the women became wilder than ever, and he was forced to seek out Melampus again, who this time demanded both a third for himself and another third for his brother Bias. The king felt he had no choice but to agree, and so Melampus led them to the city of Lusi where they were healed of their madness in a sanctuary of Artemis.

Melampus&#x27; reputation as a seer spawned myths that verge on anecdote, to account for his gift, the offering of serpents. In one, as a young boy, he told his servants not to kill two snakes. Grateful, the snakes gave Melampus the ability to speak with animals.

Another version says that he found a mother snake that had been crushed under a cart and two orphaned babies. Rather than leaving them he gave the snake a burial and raised the young ones. To thank him they licked his ears so clean that he was able to understand animals.

After this there were three kings ruling Argos at any time, one descended from each of Bias, Melampus, and Anaxagoras. Melampus was succeeded by his son Mantius, and his house of Melampus lasted down to the brothers Alcmaeon and Amphilochus, who fought in the Trojan War.

Late in his life, Melampus was kidnapped. In his cell, he overheard two termites talking, claiming they would be finished eating through Melampus&#x27; ceiling the next morning. Melampus called his captors and demanded a move. He made such an uproar that the kidnappers agreed. When the ceiling collapsed the next morning, the kidnappers decided he was a prophet and that to hold on to him might offend the gods. They let him go.

Melampus also figures in the tale of King Midas, the pleasure-loving King of Phrygia. King Midas was chosen to be a judge between the famous musical contest between Apollo and Marsyas. Although Apollo clearly had won, King Midas disagreed with the other judges. Apollo called the King an ass, and to prove his point he touched him on the head and gave Midas the ears of a donkey. Long and hairy they sprouted up, and Midas in a panic covered them up with a tall Phrygian cap, hoping nobody ever discovered his embarrassing secret.
Only his barber knew of this disgraceful matter, but Midas had warned him that he would be put to death if ever he revealed to anyone the asinine state of the King&#x27;s ears. The barber found himself bursting with the secret and couldn&#x27;t bear to keep the gossip to himself, but was afraid for his life. So he dug a hole in the bank of the Pactolus river and, after making certain that nobody was listening, he whispered into the hole that &quot;King Midas has ass&#x27;s ears.&quot; Filling up the hole to forever bury the secret, the barber went away happy and at peace with himself.

All was well until the next spring, when a reed sprouted up from the hole and whispered to the other reeds that King Midas had the ears of a donkey. These reeds in turn whispered the secret to all creatures who passed. Soon the birds learned the news and brought it to Melampus. Melampus told all his friends and soon the entire kingdom knew about King Midas&#x27; miserable secret.

==Melampus&#x27; alleged writings==
Three works have survived under the name &quot;Melampus.&quot; 
* &quot;Peri Palmon Mantike&quot;, an extended treatise on divination by twitches (palomancy), existing in a number of versions; 
* &quot;Peri Elaion tou somatos&quot;, a short work on divination by moles 
* An astrological lunarium. The twitch text begins with a dedication to a king Ptolemy, probably Ptolemy Philadelphus, which is also probably .
A certain Melampus wrote a treatise on the laws of symmetry prior to the first century BC. (Vitruvius VII, introduction). This treatise is lost.

==&quot;Melampodia&quot;==
A work attributed in antiquity to Hesiod exists (&quot;Melampodia&quot;) in such fragmentary quotations and chance remarks that its reconstruction, according to Walter Burkert, is &quot;most uncertain.&quot; An attempt was made by I Löffler, &quot;Die Melampodie: Versuch einer Rekonstruction des Inhalts&quot; (1963).

<text>In Greek mythology, Neoptolemus (; ), originally called Pyrrhus at birth (; ), was the son of the mythical warrior Achilles and the princess Deidamia, and the brother of Oneiros. He became the progenitor of the ruling dynasty of the Molossians of ancient Epirus. In a reference to his pedigree, Neoptolemus was sometimes called Achillides (from his father Achilles&#x27; name) or, from his grandfather&#x27;s or great-grandfather&#x27;s names, Pelides or [[Neoptolemus|Aeacides]].

== Description ==
In his &quot;Chronography&quot; the chronicler Malalas described Neoptolemus as &quot;of good stature, good chest, thin, white, good nose, ruddy hair, wooly hair, light-eyed, big-eyed, blond eyebrows, blond beginnings of a beard, round-faced, precipitate, daring, agile, a fierce fighter&quot;. Meanwhile, in the account of Dares the Phrygian, he was described as &quot;large, robust, and easily irritated. He lisped slightly, and was good-looking, with a hooked nose, round eyes, and shaggy eyebrows&quot;.

=== Background and Birth ===

In &quot;Cypria&quot;, Achilles sails to Skyros after a failed expedition to Troy, marries princess Deidamia and fathers Neoptolemus with her before being called to arms yet again.

In a non-Homeric version of the story, Achilles&#x27;s mother Thetis had a vision many years before Achilles&#x27;s birth that there would be a great war, and that her only son was to die in it if he partook. She tried to prevent him from being called to fight in the Trojan War by hiding him, disguised as a woman, in the court of Lycomedes, the king of Skyros. During his stay, Achilles had an affair with the princess, Deidamea, who then gave birth to Neoptolemus (originally called Pyrrhus, because his father had called himself Pyrrha, the female version of that name, while disguised as a woman). 

Most accounts mention Deidamia being Neoptolemus&#x27;s mother, but in some accounts, he was the son of Achilles by Iphigenia instead. In those accounts, his father transported him to the island of Skyros after the sacrifice of his mother.

=== Trojan War ===
The Greeks captured the Trojan seer Helenus and forced him to tell them under what conditions they could take Troy. Helenus revealed to them that they could defeat Troy if they could acquire the poisonous arrows of Heracles (then in the possession of Philoctetes); steal the Palladium (which led to the building of the famous wooden horse of Troy); and put Achilles&#x27; son in the war.

The Greeks then sent Odysseus to retrieve Neoptolemus, then a mere teenager, from Skyros. The two then went to Lemnos to retrieve Philoctetes (years earlier, on the way to Troy, Philoctetes had been bitten by a snake on Chryse Island). Agamemnon had advised that he be left behind because the wound was festering and smelled bad. Philoctetes&#x27;s retrieval is the plot of &quot;Philoctetes&quot;, a play by Sophocles.

Some sources portray Neoptolemus as brutal. He killed at least six on the field of battle and several more during the subsequent fall of Troy (Priam, Eurypylus, Polyxena, Polites and Astyanax (Hector and Andromache&#x27;s infant son) among others). He captured Helenus, and made Andromache his concubine. The ghost of Achilles appeared to the survivors of the war, demanding the Trojan princess Polyxena to be sacrificed before anybody could leave for home; Neoptolemus was the one to carry out the sacrifice. (In scene (ll 566–575) of Euripides&#x27;s play &quot;Hekabe&quot; (also known as &quot;Hecuba&quot;) Neoptolemus is shown as a torn young man who kills Polyxena in the least painful way possible, contrasting with his usual brutal and uncompassionate image.) With Andromache, Helenus and Phoenix, Neoptolemus then sailed to the Epirot Islands and became the king of Epirus. 

By the enslaved Andromache, daughter of Cilician king Eëtion, Neoptolemus was the father of Molossos (and, according to the myth, therefore an ancestor of Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great), Pielus, Pergamus and Amphialus.

Hyginus has a section on Amphialus:

Neoptolemus, son of Achilles and Deidamia, begat Amphialus by captive Andromache, daughter of Ēëtion. But after he heard that Hermione his betrothed had been given to Orestes in marriage, he went to Lacedaemon and demanded her from Menelaus. Menelaus did not wish to go back on his word, and took Hermione from Orestes and gave her to Neoptolemus. Orestes, thus insulted, slew Neoptolemus as he was sacrificing to Delphi, and recovered Hermione. The bones of Neoptolemus were scattered through the land of Ambracia, which is in the district of Epirus.

By Lanassa, granddaughter of Heracles, he fathered eight children.

Like in Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Hekabe&quot;, Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Philoctetes&quot; also shows him as a much kinder man, who honours his promises and shows remorse when he is made to trick Philoctetes.

=== After the War ===
There are two differing accounts of Neoptolemus&#x27;s death: he was either killed after he attempted to take Hermione from Orestes, or after he denounced Apollo, the murderer of his father. In the first case, he was killed by Orestes; in the second, the Delphic priest of Apollo named Machaereus took revenge.

After Neoptolemus&#x27;s death his kingdom was partitioned. According to Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Helenus (who later married Andromache) took part of it: &quot;Helenus, a son of Priam, was king over these Greek cities of Epirus, having succeeded to the throne and bed of Pyrrhus ...&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Lycomedes (), also known as Lycurgus, was the most prominent king of the Dolopians in the island of Scyros near Euboea during the Trojan War.

== Family ==
Lycomedes was the father of seven daughters including Deidameia, and grandfather of Pyrrhus or Neoptolemus.

==Mythology==
===Death of Theseus===
Plutarch says that Lycomedes killed Theseus, who had fled to his island in exile by pushing him off a cliff for he feared that Theseus would dethrone him, as people of the island treated the guest with marked honor. Some related that the cause of this violence was that Lycomedes would not give up the estates which Theseus had in Scyros, or the circumstance that Lycomedes wanted to gain the favour of Menestheus.

===Achilles===

At the request of Thetis, Lycomedes concealed Achilles in female disguise among his own daughters. At Lycomedes&#x27; court, Achilles had an affair with Deidamia, which resulted in the birth of Neoptolemus (Pyrrhus). As Odysseus drew Achilles out of his disguise and took him to Troy, Neoptolemus stayed with his grandfather until he too was summoned during the later stages of the war.

== Namesake ==
The asteroid 9694 Lycomedes is named for him – being a Jupiter Trojan, a group of asteroids which are by convention named for characters associated with the Trojan War.

<text>In Greek mythology, Deidamia (; Ancient Greek: Δηϊδάμεια &quot;Deïdameia&quot;) was a princess of Scyros as a daughter of King Lycomedes.

== Mythology ==
Deidamia was one of King Lycomedes&#x27; seven daughters with whom Achilles was concealed. Some versions of this story state that Achilles was hidden in Lycomedes&#x27; court as one of the king&#x27;s daughters, some say as a lady-in-waiting under the name &quot;Pyrrha&quot;. The two soon became romantically involved to the point of intimacy. After Odysseus arrived at Lycomedes&#x27;s palace and exposed Achilles as a young man, the hero decided to join the Trojan War, along with his &quot;therápon&quot; Patroclus, leaving behind his wife Deidamia. 

Years later, Deidamia tried to persuade their son, Neoptolemus, not to join his father in the same war. After the death of Achilles, his father, Neoptolemus went to the Trojan War as the next &quot;Aristos Achaion&quot; &quot;Best of the Achaeans (Greeks)&quot;. After the war, she was given in marriage by Neoptolemus to his slave Helenus of Troy, the son of Priam who he had brought to Epirus. Later on, Neoptolemus was eventually killed by Orestes when the son of Agamemnon went mad. 

In some accounts, Achilles and Deidamia had another son, Oneiros. He was killed by Orestes, who didn&#x27;t recognize him, in Phocis while fighting with him over a place to pitch a tent.

<doc id="81735" wikidata="Q223134" url="?curid=81735" title="Olympias">
<text>Olympias (; c. 375–316 BC) was a Greek princess of the Molossians, the eldest daughter of king Neoptolemus I of Epirus, the sister of Alexander I of Epirus, the fourth wife of Philip II, the king of Macedonia and the mother of Alexander the Great. She was extremely influential in Alexander&#x27;s life and was recognized as &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Macedon during Alexander&#x27;s conquests. According to the 1st century AD biographer, Plutarch, she was a devout member of the orgiastic snake-worshiping cult of Dionysus, and he suggests that she slept with snakes in her bed.

After her son&#x27;s death, Olympias fought on behalf of Alexander&#x27;s son Alexander IV, successfully defeating Adea Eurydice. After she was finally defeated by Cassander, his armies refused to execute her, and he finally had to summon family members of those Olympias had previously killed to end her life.

==Origin==
Olympias was the eldest daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of the Molossians, an ancient Greek tribe in Epirus, and sister of Alexander I of Epirus. She also had a sister named Troas, who married their paternal uncle Arrybas of Epirus.

Her family belonged to the Aeacidae, a well-respected family of Epirus, which claimed descent from Neoptolemus, son of Achilles. They took their name from the mythical king Aeacus, who ruled in the island of Aegina in the Saronic Gulf. The Aeacidae were perhaps the only Epirotes who were universally recognised as Greek. Although unknown, some scholars have theorized that Olympias&#x27; mother may have been a Chaonian princess, based on the rumour that Olympias used to say that she was also a descendant of the Trojan prince, Helenus son of Priam (the last king of Troy) and Andromache, wife of Hector. 

Apparently, she was originally named Polyxena, as Plutarch mentions in his work &quot;Moralia&quot;, and changed her name to Myrtale prior to her marriage to Philip II of Macedon as part of her initiation into an unknown mystery cult. The name &quot;Olympias&quot; was the third of four names by which she was known. She probably took it as a recognition of Philip&#x27;s victory in the Olympic Games of 356 BC, the news of which coincided with Alexander&#x27;s birth (Plut. Alexander 3.8). She was finally named Stratonice, which was probably an epithet attached to Olympias following her victory over Eurydice in 317 BC.

==Queen of Macedonia==
When Neoptolemus I died in 360 BC, his brother Arybbas succeeded him on the Molossian throne. In 358 BC, Arybbas made a treaty with the new king of Macedonia, Philip II, and the Molossians became allies of the Macedonians. The alliance was cemented with a diplomatic marriage between Arybbas&#x27; niece, Olympias, and Philip in 357 BC. It made Olympias the queen consort of Macedonia, and Philip the king. Philip had allegedly fallen in love with Olympias when both were initiated into the mysteries of Cabeiri at the Sanctuary of the Great Gods, on the island of Samothrace, though their marriage was largely political in nature in order to seal the alliance between Macedonia and Epirus.

One year later, in 356 BC, Philip&#x27;s race horse won in the Olympic Games; for this victory, his wife, who was known then as Myrtale, received the name &quot;Olympias&quot;. In the summer of the same year, Olympias gave birth to her first child, Alexander. In ancient Greece people believed that the birth of a great man was accompanied by portents. As Plutarch describes, the night before the consummation of their marriage, Olympias dreamed that a thunderbolt fell upon her womb and a great fire was kindled, its flames dispersed all about and then were extinguished. After the marriage Philip dreamed that he put a seal upon his wife&#x27;s womb, the device of which was the figure of a lion. Aristander&#x27;s interpretation was that Olympias was pregnant of a son whose nature would be bold and lion-like. Philip and Olympias also had a daughter, Cleopatra, who later married her uncle, Alexander I of Epirus, to further diplomatic ties between Macedonia and Epirus.
According to primary sources, their marriage was very stormy due to Philip&#x27;s volatility and Olympias&#x27; ambition and jealousy, which led to their growing estrangement. Things got more tumultuous in 337 BC when Philip married a noble Macedonian woman, Cleopatra, the niece of Attalus, who was given the name Eurydice by Philip. At a gathering after the marriage, Philip failed to defend Alexander&#x27;s claim to the Macedonian throne when Attalus threatened his legitimacy, causing great tensions between Philip, Olympias, and Alexander. Olympias went into voluntary exile in Epirus along with Alexander, staying at the Molossian court of her brother Alexander I, who was the king at the time.

In 336 BC, Philip cemented his ties to Alexander I of Epirus by offering him the hand of his and Olympias&#x27; daughter Cleopatra in marriage, a fact that led Olympias to further isolation as she could no longer count on her brother&#x27;s support. However, Philip was murdered by Pausanias, a member of Philip&#x27;s &quot;somatophylakes&quot;, his personal bodyguard, while attending the wedding, and Olympias, who returned to Macedonia, was suspected of having countenanced his assassination.

==Alexander&#x27;s reign and the Wars of the Diadochi==
After the death of Philip II, which Olympias was believed to have either ordered or been an accessory to according to some ancient historical accounts, Olympias was allegedly also involved in overseeing the execution of Eurydice and her child in order to secure Alexander&#x27;s position as the rightful king of Macedonia. During Alexander&#x27;s campaigns, she regularly corresponded with him and may have confirmed her son&#x27;s claim in Egypt that his father was not Philip but Zeus. The relationship between Olympias and Alexander was cordial, but her son tried to keep her away from politics. However, she wielded great influence in Macedonia and caused troubles to Antipater, the regent of the kingdom. In 330 BC, she returned to Epirus and served as a regent to her cousin Aeacides in the Epirote state, as her brother Alexander I had died during a campaign in southern Italy.

After Alexander the Great&#x27;s death in Babylon in 323 BC, his wife Roxana gave birth to their son named Alexander IV. Alexander IV and his uncle Philip III Arrhidaeus, the half brother of Alexander the Great who may have been disabled, were subject to the regency of Perdiccas, who tried to strengthen his position through a marriage with Antipater&#x27;s daughter Nicaea. At the same time, Olympias offered Perdiccas the hand of her and Philip&#x27;s daughter, Cleopatra. Perdiccas chose Cleopatra, which angered Antipater, who allied himself with several other Diadochi, deposed Perdiccas, and was declared regent, only to die within the year.

Polyperchon succeeded Antipater in 319 BC as regent, but Antipater&#x27;s son Cassander established Philip II&#x27;s son Philip III (Arrhidaeus) as king and forced Polyperchon out of Macedonia. He fled to Epirus, taking Roxana and her son Alexander IV with him, who had previously been left in the care of Olympias. At the beginning, Olympias had not been involved in this conflict, but she soon realized that in the case of Cassander&#x27;s rule, her grandson would lose the crown, so she allied with Polyperchon in 317 BC. The Macedonian soldiers supported her return and the united armies of Polyperchon and Olympias, with the house of Aeacides, invaded Macedonia to drive Cassander out from power.

After winning in battle by convincing the army of Adea Eurydice, the wife of Philip III, to side with her own, Olympias captured and executed the two in October 317 BC. She also captured Cassander&#x27;s brother and a hundred of his partisans. Cassander soon blockaded and besieged Olympias in Pydna and one of the terms of the capitulation had been that Olympias&#x27;s life would be saved, but Cassander had decided to execute her, sparing only temporarily the lives of Roxana and Alexander IV (they were executed a few years later in 309 BC). When the fortress of Pydna fell, Cassander ordered Olympias killed, but the soldiers refused to harm the mother of Alexander the Great. There are differing stories about her death. Pausanias states that she was stoned to death by the families of her many victims. Justinus says she went out to meet her enemies in royal attire with two maids and forced them to stab her publicly, &quot;so that you could see Alexander even in his dying mother.&quot; Cassander is also said to have denied to her body the rites of burial. 
==Iconography==
A medal bearing the name &quot;Olympias&quot; was found in 1902 at Abu Qir, Egypt that dates back to AD 225–250, and belongs to the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. The reverse shows a Nereid mounted on a fantastic sea creature. It had been suggested that the Olympias depicted on the medal was Queen Olympias, but this theory has been challenged. The name ΟΛΥΜΠΙΑΔΟΣ is thought to refer to the Olympiads instead.

<doc id="81736" wikidata="Q1972279" url="?curid=81736" title="Wilfredo Gómez">
<text>Wilfredo Gómez Rivera (; born October 29, 1956), sometimes referred to as Bazooka Gómez, is a Puerto Rican former professional boxer and three weight world champion. He is frequently mentioned among the best Puerto Rican boxers of all time by sports journalists and analysts, along with Félix Trinidad, Miguel Cotto, Wilfred Benítez, Esteban De Jesús, Edwin Rosario, and Carlos Ortíz.

His seventeen consecutive knockouts in championship defenses as a junior featherweight is a record for all boxing divisions. He was ranked number 13 on The Ring magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 greatest punchers of all time&quot;. In 1995, Gómez was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
Gómez was born in a poor area of Las Monjas of Hato Rey in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the son of Jacobo Gómez and Paula Rivera. Gómez himself reportedly used a bicycle as means of transportation when he was young, and he sold candy to earn pocket money before becoming an amateur boxer.

==Amateur career and professional debut==
Gómez won the gold medal at the 1974 Central American and Caribbean Games held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and 1974 World Championships in Havana, Cuba before turning professional. He also competed in the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany, getting eliminated by an Egyptian rival in the Olympic&#x27;s first round of bouts. He compiled an overall record of 96 wins and 3 defeats as an amateur boxer. Because of his family&#x27;s economic situation, he decided not to wait for the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, opting to begin making money right after the 1974 World Amateur Boxing championship instead. Coming from Puerto Rico, he settled for less money and exposure from the American media, and moved to Panama, where he began to tour all of Central America in hopes of finding matches. His professional debut came in Panama City, Panama, where he fought to a draw with Jacinto Fuentes.

==Professional career==
After this inauspicious debut, he reeled off a streak of 32 consecutive knockouts including wins over Fuentes, who was dispatched in 2 rounds in a rematch, and future world champion Alberto Davila, who lasted 9 rounds before being defeated. His 32 consecutive knockouts place him in a third place tie with Deontay Wilder and behind LaMar Clark (44) and Billy Fox (43) for the all-time knockout streak.

Gómez&#x27;s knockout streak caught the eye of the WBC and Lineal Super Bantamweight champion Dong Kyun Yum of South Korea, who travelled to San Juan, Puerto Rico to defend his crown against Gómez. Yum had a promising start, dropping Gómez 30 seconds into the bout, but Gómez picked himself up and eventually won the crown, his first world title, with a 12th-round knockout. His second defense took him to Tokyo, where he beat former world champion Royal Kobayashi in three rounds. Kobayashi had lasted 5 rounds vs Alexis Argüello. Next was Sagat Petchyindee in a small city of Thailand. He lasted two rounds. Petchyndee later became a world champion Thai and kick-boxer and famous actor in Thailand. The bout with Petchyndee was preceded by a large tragedy when a column collapsed inside the stadium before the evening&#x27;s main event; ten people lost their lives and an estimated 300 were injured, but the contest&#x27;s organizers nevertheless decided to continue with the day&#x27;s boxing show.

Gómez&#x27;s streak reached 32 knockouts in a row, including what is generally considered to be his biggest victory ever, a five-round defeat of bantamweight champion Carlos Zárate, who was 55–0 with 54 knockout wins coming into their San Juan bout. Also included in that streak was future world champion Leo Cruz, beaten in 13 rounds at San Juan and Derrik Holmes, knocked out in five rounds in a fight attended, among others, by Sylvester Stallone, Carl Weathers and Alexis Arguello. After recording his 32nd. knockout win in a row, he moved up in weight to face the world featherweight champion Salvador Sánchez of Mexico.He lost to Salvador Sanchez by 8th-round TKO.

Hoping to get a rematch with Sanchez, Gómez went back to the super bantamweight division, where he got a dispense from the WBC to make two preparation bouts before defending his title again. He did so and won two non-title bouts, both by knockout, one in the 2nd round over Jose Luis Soto, who was a stablemate of Julio César Chávez back in Culiacán, Mexico. Wins over future world champ Juan &#x27;Kid&#x27; Meza, knocked out in six in Atlantic City, and Juan Antonio Lopez, knocked out in ten as part of the Larry Holmes vs. Gerry Cooney undercard followed. But all chances of a rematch with Sanchez were dashed when Sanchez died in a car crash outside Mexico City the morning of August 12, 1982. Boxing fans across Latin America mourned the tragedy. Gómez, who was training to defend against Mexican Roberto Rubaldino only five days later, took a quick trip to Mexico to offer Sanchez flowers and then returned to Puerto Rico the same afternoon. He beat Rubaldino by knockout in 8 rounds and made one more title defense, against the Mexican bantamweight world champ Lupe Pintor in the Carnival of Champions in New Orleans, winning by knockout in 14 rounds. The Pintor contest was the only time a Gómez fight was showcased on HBO, which at the time exclusively showcased the largest boxing fights, much like the Pay Per View system does currently.

By the time he was done with the Junior Featherweights, Gómez had established a division record of 17 defenses, and a world record of most defenses in a row won by knockout, all his defenses finishing before the established distance limit.

==Featherweight division==

He then re-tried winning the Featherweight title and this time, he achieved his dream, winning his second world title by dethroning Juan Laporte, a fellow Puerto Rican who had won the title left vacant after Sanchez died. He beat Laporte by a 12-round unanimous decision. This time, however, he didn&#x27;t enjoy a lengthy title reign. Ahead on all scorecards, Gómez was the victim of a rally by Azumah Nelson of Ghana who knocked him out in 11 rounds in San Juan, December 8, 1984.

Gómez wanted either a rematch with Nelson or a shot at WBA and Lineal Junior Lightweight world champion Rocky Lockridge of New Jersey, whichever came first. Lockridge was first to offer Gómez a try, and the 2 battled a closely scored 15 round bout in San Juan, with Gómez being given a majority 15-round decision, which many experts have said Lockridge deserved, but also which in the opinion of most who saw it live, was a justified decision.

Around this time, he began a shortly lived career as a boxing broadcaster. He specifically covered the Victor Callejas-Loris Stecca rematch from Italy for Puerto Rico&#x27;s WAPA-TV, won by Callejas by sixth round technical knockout, and some local matches involving Alberto Mercado and Juan Carazo in Puerto Rico for Tele-Once.

This reign also came to an end quick, Gómez being handed his 3rd loss at the hands of young Alfredo Layne by knockout in 9 rounds. Layne lost the title in his own first defense to South Africa&#x27;s Brian Mitchell, and it became obvious Gómez&#x27;s best years had gone by, so he retired after this fight.

==Last fights and retirement==
Gómez tried a comeback in 1988 and 1989, but after winning 2 more bouts by knockout, he realized boxing wasn&#x27;t in his heart anymore and retired for good. He later moved to Venezuela, where he ran into drug problems, causing him trouble with the law and spending some months in jail. He attended a rehabilitation center in Colombia. Gómez rebounded and is now back in Puerto Rico, where he has managed to stay off drugs. He helped Hector Camacho with the training of Camacho&#x27;s son Héctor Camacho Jr., who was a boxer in the Jr Welterweight division. In 1998, Gómez became a born-again Christian.

On May 18, 2003, Gómez returned to Panama, where he was received by friends Roberto Duran and Eusebio Pedroza, among others. In a message geared towards Panamanians, he expressed thanks to that country, calling it his second country and saying, among other things &quot;I&#x27;m very motivated now that I will return to Puerto Rico, and no one should be surprised if I buy an apartment in Panama and move my family here&quot;. However, he bought a house in Orlando, Florida in 2006.

Gómez had a record of 44 wins, 3 losses and 1 draw, with 42 knockout wins and all three losses also by knockout. In 1978, he was named Boxing Illustrated&#x27;s Fighter of the Year.

<doc id="81737" wikidata="Q19376" url="?curid=81737" title="Andromache">
<text>In Greek mythology, Andromache (; , ) was the wife of Hector, daughter of Eetion, and sister to Podes. She was born and raised in the city of Cilician Thebe, over which her father ruled. The name means &#x27;man battler&#x27; or &#x27;fighter of men&#x27; or &#x27;man fighter&#x27; (there was also a famous Amazon warrior named &quot;Andromache&quot;, probably in this meaning) or &#x27;man&#x27;s battle&#x27; (that is: &#x27;courage&#x27; or &#x27;manly virtue&#x27;), from the Greek stem &#x27;man&#x27; and &#x27;battle&#x27;.

Following the Trojan War, after Achilles had killed Hector and Troy had been captured and sacked by the Greeks, the Greek herald Talthybius informed her of a plan to kill Astyanax, her son by Hector, by throwing him from the city walls. This act was carried out by Neoptolemus who then took Andromache as a concubine and Hector&#x27;s brother, Helenus, as a slave. By Neoptolemus, she was the mother of Molossus, and according to Pausanias, of Pielus and Pergamus. When Neoptolemus died, Andromache married Helenus and became Queen of Epirus. Pausanias also implies that Helenus&#x27; son, Cestrinus, was by Andromache. In Epirus Andromache faithfully continued to make offerings at Hector’s cenotaph. Andromache eventually went to live with her youngest son, Pergamus in Pergamum, where she died of old age. Andromache was famous for her fidelity and virtue; her character represents the suffering of Trojan women during war.

== Description ==
Andromache was described by the chronicler Malalas in his account of the &quot;Chronography&quot; as &quot;above average height, thin, well turned out, good nose, good breasts, good eyes, good brows, wooly hair, blondish hair long in back, large-featured, good neck, dimples on her cheeks, charming, quick&quot;. Meanwhile, in the account of Dares the Phrygian, she was illustrated as &quot;. . .bright-eyed and fair, with a tall and beautiful body. She was modest, wise, chaste, and charming.&quot;

==Life==
=== Families ===
Andromache was born in Cilician Thebe, a city that the Achaeans later sacked, with Achilles killing her father Eetion and seven brothers. After this, her mother died of illness (6.425). She was taken from her father&#x27;s household by Hector, who had brought countless wedding-gifts (22.470-72). Thus Priam’s household alone provides Andromache with her only familial support. In contrast to the inappropriate relationship of Paris and Helen, Hector and Andromache fit the Greek ideal of a happy and productive marriage, which heightens the tragedy of their shared misfortune. Andromache and Hector have a son together, named Scamandrius but called Astyanax by both the people of Troy and Homer. 

Andromache is alone after Troy falls and her son is killed. Notably, Andromache remains unnamed in &quot;Iliad&quot; 22, referred to only as the wife of Hector (Greek &quot;alokhos&quot;), indicating the centrality of her status as Hector&#x27;s wife and of the marriage itself to her identity. The Greeks divide the Trojan women as spoils of war and permanently separate them from the ruins of Troy and from one another. Hector&#x27;s fears of her life as a captive woman are realized as her family is entirely stripped from her by the violence of war, as she fulfills the fate of conquered women in ancient warfare (6.450–465). Without her familial structure, Andromache is a displaced woman who must live outside familiar and even safe societal boundaries.

=== Life after the fall of Troy ===

After Troy falls, Andromache is given as a concubine to Neoptolemus, also called Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, after her son Astyanax is murdered at the suggestion of Odysseus, who fears he will grow up to avenge his father Hector. She goes with him to Phthia, where Thetis and Peleus, the parents of Achilles, lived. Hyginus calls her son Amphialus, while Euripides gives his name as Molossus and Pausanias says that she has three children, named Molossus, Pielus and Pergamus. In Euripides&#x27; &quot;Andromache&quot;, Hermione, the wife of Neoptolemus and daughter of Helen and Menelaus, tries to kill Andromache because she believes Andromache has cursed her with infertility. In the play, Neoptolemus is killed by Orestes, who marries Hermione, and the goddess Thetis announces that Andromache will marry her ex-brother-in-law Helenus and live with him in &quot;the land of the Molossians&quot;, where her son Molossus will start &quot;an unbroken succession of kings who will live happy lives&quot;. In Pausanias&#x27; account Helenus&#x27; son Cestrinus was the child of Andromache. Aeneas also visits Andromache and Helenus when they are living in Chaonia, where Helenus gives him a prophecy and Andromache brings robes and a Phrygian cloak for Aeneas&#x27; son Ascanius and tells him he is &quot;the sole image left to [her] of [her] Astyanax&quot;. Pausanias, writing in the 2nd century AD, says that &quot;there is still a shrine [to Andromache] in the city&quot; that was named after her son Pergamus.

== Role in society ==

===Mourning her husband===
Andromache&#x27;s gradual discovery of her husband&#x27;s death and her immediate lamentation (22.437–515) culminate the shorter lamentations of Priam and Hecuba upon Hector&#x27;s death (22.405–36). In accordance with traditional customs of mourning, Andromache responds with an immediate and impulsive outburst of grief (&quot;goos&quot;) that begins the ritual lamentation. She casts away her various pieces of headdress (22.468-72) and leads the Trojan women in ritual mourning, both of which they did (22.405–36). Although Andromache adheres to the formal practice of female lamentation in Homeric epic, the raw emotion of her discovery yields a miserable beginning to a new era in her life without her husband and, ultimately, without a home. The final stage of the mourning process occurs in &quot;Iliad&quot; 24 in the formal, communal grieving (&quot;thrēnos&quot;) upon the return of Hector&#x27;s body (24.703–804). In a fragment of Ennius&#x27; &quot;Andromacha&quot;, quoted by Cicero in the Tusculan Disputations (3.44-46), Andromacha sings about her loss of Hector.

===Duties as wife===
In &quot;Iliad&quot; 22, Andromache is portrayed as the perfect wife, weaving a cloak for her husband in the innermost chambers of the house and preparing a bath in anticipation of his return from battle (22.440–6). Here she is carrying out an action Hector had ordered her to perform during their conversation in &quot;Iliad&quot; 6 (6.490–92), and this obedience is another display of womanly virtue in Homer&#x27;s eyes. However, Andromache is seen in &quot;Iliad&quot; 6 in an unusual place for the traditional housewife, standing before the ramparts of Troy (6.370–373). Traditional gender roles are breached as well, as Andromache gives Hector military advice (6.433–439). Although her behavior may seem nontraditional, hard times disrupt the separate spheres of men and women, requiring a shared civic response to the defence of the city as a whole. Andromache&#x27;s sudden tactical lecture is a way to keep Hector close, by guarding a section of the wall instead of fighting out in the plains. Andromache&#x27;s role as a mother, a fundamental element of her position in marriage, is emphasized within this same conversation. Their infant son, Astyanax, is also present at the ramparts as a maid tends to him. Hector takes his son from the maid, yet returns him to his wife, a small action that provides great insight into the importance Homer placed on her care-taking duties as mother (6.466–483). A bonding moment between mother and father occurs in this scene when Hector&#x27;s helmet scares Astyanax, providing a moment of light relief in the story. After Hector&#x27;s death in &quot;Iliad&quot; 22, Andromache&#x27;s foremost concern is Astyanax&#x27;s fate as a mistreated orphan (22.477–514).

==Modern treatment==

Andromache is the subject of a tragedy by French classical playwright Jean Racine (1639–1699), entitled &quot;Andromaque&quot;, and a minor character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. &quot;The Andromache&quot; is referenced in The Duc De L&#x27;Omelette written by Edgar Allan Poe in published in 1832. In 1857, she also importantly appears in Baudelaire&#x27;s poem, &quot;Le Cygne&quot;, in &quot;Les Fleurs du Mal&quot;. Andromache is the subject of a 1932 opera by German composer Herbert Windt and also a lyric scena for soprano and orchestra by Samuel Barber. She was portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave in the 1971 film version of Euripides&#x27; &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;, and by Saffron Burrows in the 2004 film &quot;Troy&quot;. She also appears as a character in David Gemmell&#x27;s &quot;Troy&quot; series. In the 2018 TV miniseries &quot;&quot;, she was portrayed by Chloe Pirrie. Andromache is one of the main characters of the 2023 fictional retelling of Troy, &quot;Horses of Fire&quot; by A.D. Rhine (pseudonym of Ashlee Cowles and Danielle Stinson).

<text>In Greek mythology, Astyanax (; &quot;Astyánax&quot;, &quot;lord of the city&quot;) was the son of Hector, the crown prince of Troy, and of his wife, Princess Andromache of Cilician Thebe. His birth name was Scamandrius (in Greek: Σκαμάνδριος Skamandrios, after the river Scamander), but the people of Troy nicknamed him Astyanax (i.e. high king, or overlord of the city), because he was the son of the city&#x27;s great defender (&quot;Iliad&quot; VI, 403) and the heir apparent&#x27;s firstborn son.

During the Trojan War, Andromache hid the child in Hector&#x27;s tomb, but the child was discovered. His fate was debated by the Greeks, for if he were allowed to live, it was feared he would avenge his father and rebuild Troy. In the version given by the &quot;Little Iliad&quot; and repeated by Pausanias (x 25.4), he was killed by Neoptolemus (also called Pyrrhus), who threw the infant from the walls, as predicted by Andromache in the Iliad. Another version is given in &quot;Iliou persis&quot;, in which Odysseus kills Astyanax. It has also been depicted in some Greek vases that Neoptolemus kills Priam, who has taken refuge near a sacred altar, using Astyanax&#x27;s dead body to club the old king to death, in front of horrified onlookers. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, the child is thrown from the walls by the Greek victors (13, 413ff). In Euripides&#x27;s &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; (719 ff), the herald Talthybius reveals to Andromache that Odysseus has convinced the council to have the child thrown from the walls, and the child is in this way killed. In Seneca&#x27;s version of &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;, the prophet Calchas declares that Astyanax must be thrown from the walls if the Greek fleet is to be allowed favorable winds (365–70), but once led to the tower, the child himself leaps off the walls (1100–3). For Hector&#x27;s mother, Hecuba, Astyanax was the only hope and consolation, and his death&#x27;s announcement was a terrible climax of the catastrophe. Other sources for the story of the Sack of Troy and Astyanax&#x27;s death can be found in the &quot;Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)&quot;, Hyginus (&quot;Fabula&quot; 109), Tryphiodorus (&quot;Sack of Troy&quot; 644–6).

==Survival==
There are numerous traditions up through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance that have Astyanax survive the destruction of Troy:

* In one version, either Talthybius finds he cannot bear to kill him or else kills a slave&#x27;s child in his place. Astyanax survives to found settlements in Corsica and Sardinia.
*The &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot; contains the oldest mention of a medieval legend linking the Franks to the Trojans. One legend, as further elaborated through the Middle Ages, established Astyanax, renamed &quot;Francus&quot;, as the founder of the Merovingian dynasty and forefather of Charlemagne.
* In Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, &quot;the sons of Hector&quot; reigned in Troy after the expulsion of Antenor and his followers.
*In Matteo Maria Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot; (1495), Andromache saves Astyanax by hiding him in a tomb, replacing him with another child who is killed along with her by the Greeks. Taken to Sicily, Astyanax becomes the ruler of Messina, killing the giant-king of Agrigento (named Agranor) and marries the queen of Syracuse. He is killed treacherously by Aegisthus, but his wife escapes to Reggio and bears a son (Polidoro), from whom the epic hero Ruggiero is descended (III, v, 18-27). In this tradition, the epic hero Roland&#x27;s sword Durendal is the very sword used by Hector, and Roland wins the sword by defeating a Saracen knight (Almonte, the son of Agolant) who had defeated Ruggiero II.
*In Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, a continuation of Boiardo&#x27;s poem, Astyanax is saved from Odysseus (36.70) by substituting another boy of his age for himself. Astyanax arrives in Sicily, eventually becomes King of Messina, and his heirs later rule over Calabria (36.70–73). From these rulers is descended Ruggiero II, father of the hero Ruggiero, legendary founder of the house of Este.
* Based on the medieval legend, Jean Lemaire de Belges&#x27;s &quot;Illustrations de Gaule et Singularités de Troie&quot; (1510–12) has Astyanax survive the fall of Troy and arrive in Western Europe. He changes his name to Francus and becomes King of Celtic Gaul (while, at the same time, &quot;Bavo&quot;, cousin of Priam, comes to the city of Trier) and founds the dynasty leading to Pepin and Charlemagne.
*Lemaire de Belges&#x27; work inspired Pierre de Ronsard&#x27;s epic poem &quot;La Franciade&quot; (1572). In this poem, Jupiter saves Astyanax (renamed Francus). The young hero arrives in Crete and falls in love with the princess Hyanthe with whom he is destined to found the royal dynasty of France.
*In Jean Racine&#x27;s play &quot;Andromaque&quot; (1667), Astyanax has narrowly escaped death at the hands of Odysseus, who has unknowingly been tricked into killing another child in his place. Andromache has been taken prisoner in Epirus by Neoptolemus (&quot;Pyrrhus&quot;) who is due to be married to Hermione, the only daughter of the Spartan king Menelaus and Helen of Troy. Orestes, son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, brother to Electra and Iphigenia, and by now absolved of the crime of matricide prophesied by the Delphic oracle, has come to the court of Pyrrhus to plead on behalf of the Greeks for the return of Astyanax.

==Modern literature==
Astyanax is also the subject of several modern works:
*In David Gemmell&#x27;s &quot;Troy&quot; series, Astyanax is the son of Andromache and Aeneas/Helikaon (though he is unaware of this for most of the story). After the Trojan War, Aeneas escapes from Troy with Andromache and Astyanax to Seven hills, a colony in Italy Aeneas and Odysseus found.
*In S. P. Somtow&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Shattered Horse&quot;, Astyanax&#x27;s playmate, dressed in the prince&#x27;s armor, is mistakenly killed in his place; Astyanax survives to manhood and encounters many of the principal characters of the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

<text>The Appaloosa is an American horse breed best known for its colorful spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse&#x27;s color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.

Artwork depicting prehistoric horses with leopard spotting exists in prehistoric cave paintings in Europe. Images of domesticated horses with leopard spotting patterns appeared in artwork from Ancient Greece and Han dynasty China through the early modern period. In North America, the Nez Perce people of what today is the United States Pacific Northwest developed the original American breed. Settlers once referred to these spotted horses as the &quot;Palouse horse&quot;, possibly after the Palouse River, which ran through the heart of Nez Perce country. Gradually, the name evolved into &quot;Appaloosa&quot;.

The Nez Perce lost most of their horses after the Nez Perce War in 1877, and the breed fell into decline for several decades. A small number of dedicated breeders preserved the Appaloosa as a distinct breed until the Appaloosa Horse Club (ApHC) was formed as the breed registry in 1938. The modern breed maintains bloodlines tracing to the foundation bloodstock of the registry; its partially open stud book allows the addition of some Thoroughbred, American Quarter Horse and Arabian blood.

Today, the Appaloosa is one of the most popular breeds in the United States; it was named the official state horse of Idaho in 1975. It is best known as a stock horse used in a number of western riding disciplines, but is also a versatile breed with representatives seen in many other types of equestrian activity. Appaloosas have been used in many movies; an Appaloosa is a mascot for the Florida State Seminoles. Appaloosa bloodlines have influenced other horse breeds, including the Pony of the Americas, the Nez Perce Horse, and several gaited horse breeds.

== Breed characteristics ==
The Appaloosa is best known for its distinctive, leopard complex-spotted coat, which is preferred in the breed. Spotting occurs in several overlay patterns on one of several recognized base coat colors. There are three other distinctive, &quot;core&quot; characteristics: mottled skin, striped hooves, and eyes with a white sclera.

Skin mottling is usually seen around the muzzle, eyes, anus, and genitalia. Striped hooves are a common trait, quite noticeable on Appaloosas, but not unique to the breed. The sclera is the part of the eye surrounding the iris; although all horses show white around the eye if the eye is rolled back, to have a readily visible white sclera with the eye in a normal position is a distinctive characteristic seen more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Because the occasional individual is born with little or no visible spotting pattern, the ApHC allows &quot;regular&quot; registration of horses with mottled skin plus at least one of the other core characteristics. Horses with two ApHC parents but no &quot;identifiable Appaloosa characteristics&quot; are registered as &quot;non-characteristic,&quot; a limited special registration status.

There is a wide range of body types in the Appaloosa, in part because the leopard complex characteristics are its primary identifying factors, and also because several different horse breeds influenced its development. The weight range varies from , and heights from . However, the ApHC does not allow pony or draft breeding.

The original &quot;old time&quot; or &quot;old type&quot; Appaloosa was a tall, narrow-bodied, rangy horse. The body style reflected a mix that started with the traditional Spanish horses already common on the plains of America before 1700. Then, 18th-century European bloodlines were added, particularly those of the &quot;pied&quot; horses popular in that period and shipped &quot;en masse&quot; to the Americas once the color had become unfashionable in Europe. These horses were similar to a tall, slim Thoroughbred-Andalusian type of horse popular in Bourbon-era Spain. The original Appaloosa tended to have a convex facial profile that resembled that of the warmblood-Jennet crosses first developed in the 16th century during the reign of Charles V.

The old-type Appaloosa was later modified by the addition of draft horse blood after the 1877 defeat of the Nez Perce, when U.S. Government policy forced the Native Americans to become farmers and provided them with draft horse mares to breed to existing stallions. The original Appaloosas frequently had a sparse mane and tail, but that was not a primary characteristic, as many early Appaloosas did have full manes and tails. There is a possible genetic link between the leopard complex and sparse mane and tail growth, although the precise relationship is unknown.

After the formation of the Appaloosa Horse Club in 1938, a more modern type of horse was developed after the addition of American Quarter Horse and Arabian bloodlines. The addition of Quarter Horse lines produced Appaloosas that performed better in sprint racing and in halter competition. Many cutting and reining horses resulted from old-type Appaloosas crossed on Arabian bloodlines, particularly via the Appaloosa foundation stallion Red Eagle. An infusion of Thoroughbred blood was added during the 1970s to produce horses more suited for racing. Many current breeders also attempt to breed away from the sparse, &quot;rat tail&quot; trait, and therefore modern Appaloosas have fuller manes and tails.

== Color and spotting patterns ==


The coat color of an Appaloosa is a combination of a base color with an overlaid spotting pattern. The base colors recognized by the Appaloosa Horse Club include bay, black, chestnut, palomino, buckskin, cremello or perlino, roan, gray, dun and grulla. Appaloosa markings have several pattern variations. It is this unique group of spotting patterns, collectively called the &quot;leopard complex&quot;, that most people associate with the Appaloosa horse. Spots overlay darker skin, and are often surrounded by a &quot;halo&quot;, where the skin next to the spot is also dark but the overlying hair coat is white.

It is not always easy to predict a grown Appaloosa&#x27;s color at birth. Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns sometimes change over the course of the horse&#x27;s life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.

The ApHC also recognizes the concept of a &quot;solid&quot; horse, which has a base color, &quot;but no contrasting color in the form of an Appaloosa coat pattern&quot;. Solid horses can be registered if they have mottled skin, and one other leopard complex characteristic.

Solid Appaloosa horses are not to be confused with gray horses, which display a similar mottling called &quot;fleabitten gray&quot;. As they age, &quot;fleabitten&quot; grays may develop pigmented speckles in addition to a white coat. However, &quot;fleabitten gray&quot; is a different gene, and is unrelated to the leopard complex gene seen in the Appaloosa breed. While the Appaloosa Horse Club (ApHC) allows gray Appaloosa horses to be registered, gray is rare in the breed. Similarly, &quot;dapple&quot; gray horses are also different from Appaloosa horses, in terms of both coat color genes and patterning.

Base colors are overlain by various spotting patterns, which are variable and often do not fit neatly into a specific category. These patterns are described as follows:

=== Color genetics ===

Any horse that shows Appaloosa core characteristics of coat pattern, mottled skin, striped hooves, and a visible white sclera, carries at least one allele of the dominant &quot;leopard complex&quot; (LP) gene. The use of the word &quot;complex&quot; is used to refer to the large group of visible patterns that may occur when LP is present. LP is an autosomal incomplete dominant mutation in the TRPM1 gene located at horse chromosome 1 (ECA 1). All horses with at least one copy of LP show leopard characteristics, and it is hypothesized that LP acts together with other patterning genes (PATN) that have not yet been identified to produce the different coat patterns. Horses that are heterozygous for LP tend to be darker than homozygous horses, but this is not consistent.

Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TRPM1 gene have been identified as closely associated with the LP mutation, although the mechanism by which the pattern is produced remains unclear. A commercially available DNA based test is likely to be developed in the near future, which breeders can use to determine if LP is present in horses that do not have visible Appaloosa characteristics.

Not every Appaloosa exhibits visible coat spotting, but even apparently solid-colored horses that carry at least one dominant LP allele will exhibit characteristics such as vertically striped hooves, white sclera of the eye, and mottled skin around the eyes, lips, and genitalia. Appaloosas may also exhibit sabino or pinto type markings; as pinto genes may cover or obscure Appaloosa patterns, pinto breeding is discouraged by the ApHC, which will deny registration to horses with excessive white markings. The genes that create these different patterns can be present in the same horse. The Appaloosa Project, a genetic study group, researchers the interactions of Appaloosa and pinto genes, and how they affect each other.

== History ==

Recent research has suggested that Eurasian prehistoric cave paintings depicting leopard-spotted horses may have accurately reflected a phenotype of ancient wild horse. Domesticated horses with leopard complex spotting patterns have been depicted in art dating as far back as Ancient Greece, Ancient Persia, and the Han Dynasty in China; later depictions appeared in 11th-century France and 12th-century England. French paintings from the 16th and 17th centuries show horses with spotted coats being used as riding horses, and other records indicate they were also used as coach horses at the court of Louis XIV of France. In mid-18th-century Europe, there was a great demand for horses with the leopard complex spotting pattern among the nobility and royalty. These horses were used in the schools of horsemanship, for parade use, and other forms of display. Modern horse breeds in Europe today that have leopard complex spotting include the Knabstrupper and the Pinzgau, or Noriker horse.

The Spanish probably obtained spotted horses through trade with southern Austria and Hungary, where the color pattern was known to exist. The Conquistadors and Spanish settlers then brought some vividly marked horses to the Americas when they first arrived in the early 16th century. One horse with snowflake patterning was listed with the 16 horses brought to Mexico by Cortez, and additional spotted horses were mentioned by Spanish writers by 1604. Others arrived in the western hemisphere when spotted horses went out of style in late 18th-century Europe, and were shipped to Mexico, California and Oregon.

=== Nez Perce people ===

The Nez Perce people lived in what today is eastern Washington, Oregon, and north central Idaho, where they engaged in agriculture as well as horse breeding. The Nez Perce first obtained horses from the Shoshone around 1730. They took advantage of the fact that they lived in excellent horse-breeding country, relatively safe from the raids of other tribes, and developed strict breeding selection practices for their animals, establishing breeding herds by 1750. They were one of the few tribes that actively used the practice of gelding inferior male horses and trading away poorer stock to remove unsuitable animals from the gene pool, and thus were notable as horse breeders by the early 19th century.

Early Nez Perce horses were considered to be of high quality. Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition wrote in his February 15, 1806, journal entry: &quot;Their horses appear to be of an excellent race; they are lofty, eligantly formed, active and durable: in short many of them look like fine English coarsers and would make a figure in any country.&quot; Lewis did note spotting patterns, saying, &quot;... some of these horses are pided [pied] with large spots of white irregularly scattered and intermixed with the black brown bey or some other dark colour&quot;. By &quot;pied&quot;, Lewis may have been referring to leopard-spotted patterns seen in the modern Appaloosa, though Lewis also noted that &quot;much the larger portion are of a uniform colour&quot;. The Appaloosa Horse Club estimates that only about ten percent of the horses owned by the Nez Perce at the time were spotted. While the Nez Perce originally had many solid-colored horses and only began to emphasize color in their breeding some time after the visit of Lewis and Clark, by the late 19th century they had many spotted horses. As white settlers moved into traditional Nez Perce lands, a successful trade in horses enriched the Nez Perce, who in 1861 bred horses described as &quot;elegant chargers, fit to mount a prince.&quot; At a time when ordinary horses could be purchased for $15, non-Indians who had purchased Appaloosa horses from the Nez Perce turned down offers of as much as $600.

=== Nez Perce War ===

Peace with the United States dated back to an alliance arranged by Lewis and Clark, but the encroachment of gold miners in the 1860s and settlers in the 1870s put pressure on the Nez Perce. Although a treaty of 1855 originally allowed them to keep most of their traditional land, another in 1863 reduced the land allotted to them by 90 percent. The Nez Perce who refused to give up their land under the 1863 treaty included a band living in the Wallowa Valley of Oregon, led by Heinmot Tooyalakekt, widely known as Chief Joseph. Tensions rose, and in May 1877, General Oliver Otis Howard called a council and ordered the non-treaty bands to move to the reservation. Chief Joseph considered military resistance futile, and by June 14, 1877, had gathered about 600 people at a site near present-day Grangeville, Idaho. But on that day a small group of warriors staged an attack on nearby white settlers, which led to the Nez Perce War. After several small battles in Idaho, more than 800 Nez Perce, mostly non-warriors, took 2000 head of various livestock including horses and fled into Montana, then traveled southeast, dipping into Yellowstone National Park. A small number of Nez Perce fighters, probably fewer than 200, successfully held off larger forces of the U.S. Army in several skirmishes, including the two-day Battle of the Big Hole in southwestern Montana. They then moved northeast and attempted to seek refuge with the Crow Nation; rebuffed, they headed for safety in Canada.

Throughout this journey of about the Nez Perce relied heavily on their fast, agile and hardy Appaloosa horses. The journey came to an end when they stopped to rest near the Bears Paw Mountains in Montana, from the Canada–US border. Unbeknownst to the Nez Perce, Colonel Nelson A. Miles had led an infantry-cavalry column from Fort Keogh in pursuit. On October 5, 1877, after a five-day fight, Joseph surrendered. The battle—and the war—was over. With most of the war chiefs dead, and the noncombatants cold and starving, Joseph declared that he would &quot;fight no more forever&quot;.

=== Aftermath of the Nez Perce War ===

When the U.S. 7th Cavalry accepted the surrender of Chief Joseph and the remaining Nez Perce, they immediately took more than 1,000 of the tribe&#x27;s horses, sold what they could and shot many of the rest. But a significant population of horses had been left behind in the Wallowa valley when the Nez Perce began their retreat, and additional animals escaped or were abandoned along the way. The Nez Perce were ultimately settled on reservation lands in north central Idaho, were allowed few horses, and were required by the Army to crossbreed to draft horses in an attempt to create farm horses. The Nez Perce tribe never regained its former position as breeders of Appaloosas. In the late 20th century, they began a program to develop a new horse breed, the Nez Perce horse, with the intent to resurrect their horse culture, tradition of selective breeding, and horsemanship.

Although a remnant population of Appaloosa horses remained after 1877, they were virtually forgotten as a distinct breed for almost 60 years. A few quality horses continued to be bred, mostly those captured or purchased by settlers and used as working ranch horses. Others were used in circuses and related forms of entertainment, such as Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show and Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. The horses were originally called &quot;Palouse horses&quot; by settlers, a reference to the Palouse River that ran through the heart of what was once Nez Perce country. Gradually, the name evolved into &quot;Apalouse&quot;, and then &quot;Appaloosa&quot;. Other early variations of the name included &quot;Appalucy&quot;, &quot;Apalousey&quot; and &quot;Appaloosie&quot;. In one 1948 book, the breed was called the &quot;Opelousa horse&quot;, described as a &quot;hardy tough breed of Indian and Spanish horse&quot; used by backwoodsmen of the late 18th century to transport goods to New Orleans for sale. By the 1950s, &quot;Appaloosa&quot; was regarded as the correct spelling.

=== Revitalization ===

The Appaloosa came to the attention of the general public in January 1937 in &quot;Western Horseman&quot; magazine when Francis D. Haines, a history professor from Lewiston, Idaho, published an article describing the breed&#x27;s history and urging its preservation. Haines had performed extensive research, traveling with a friend and Appaloosa aficionado named George Hatley, visiting numerous Nez Perce villages, collecting history, and taking photographs. The article generated strong interest in the horse breed, and led to the founding of the Appaloosa Horse Club (ApHC) by Claude Thompson and a small group of other dedicated breeders in 1938. The registry was originally housed in Moro, Oregon; but in 1947 the organization moved to Moscow, Idaho, under the leadership of George Hatley. The Appaloosa Museum foundation was formed in 1975 to preserve the history of the Appaloosa horse. The &quot;Western Horseman&quot; magazine, and particularly its longtime publisher, Dick Spencer, continued to support and promote the breed through many subsequent articles.

A significant crossbreeding influence used to revitalize the Appaloosa was the Arabian horse, as evidenced by early registration lists that show Arabian-Appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC. For example, one of Claude Thompson&#x27;s major herd sires was Ferras, an Arabian stallion bred by W.K. Kellogg from horses imported from the Crabbet Arabian Stud of England. Ferras sired Red Eagle, a prominent Appaloosa stallion added to the Appaloosa Hall of Fame in 1988. Later, Thoroughbred and American Quarter Horse lines were added, as well as crosses from other breeds, including Morgans and Standardbreds. In 1983 the ApHC reduced the number of allowable outcrosses to three main breeds: the Arabian, the American Quarter Horse and the Thoroughbred.

By 1978 the ApHC was the third largest horse registry for light horse breeds. From 1938 to 2007 more than 670,000 Appaloosas were registered by the ApHC. The state of Idaho adopted the Appaloosa as its official state horse on March 25, 1975, when Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus signed the enabling legislation. Idaho also offers a custom license plate featuring an Appaloosa, the first state to offer a plate featuring a state horse.

== Registration ==


Located in Moscow, Idaho, the ApHC is the principal body for the promotion and preservation of the Appaloosa breed and is an international organization. Affiliate Appaloosa organizations exist in many South American and European countries, as well as South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico and Israel. The Appaloosa Horse Club has 33,000 members as of 2010, circulation of the &quot;Appaloosa Journal&quot;, which is included with most types of membership, was at 32,000 in 2008. The American Appaloosa Association was founded in 1983 by members opposed to the registration of plain-colored horses, as a result of the color rule controversy. Based in Missouri, it has a membership of more than 2,000 as of 2008. Other &quot;Appaloosa&quot; registries have been founded for horses with leopard complex genetics that are not affiliated with the ApHC. These registries tend to have different foundation bloodstock and histories than the North American Appaloosa. The ApHC is by far the largest Appaloosa horse registry, and it hosts one of the world&#x27;s largest breed shows.

The Appaloosa is &quot;a breed defined by ApHC bloodline requirements and preferred characteristics, including coat pattern&quot;. In other words, the Appaloosa is a distinct breed from limited bloodlines with distinct physical traits and a desired color, referred to as a &quot;color preference&quot;. Appaloosas are not strictly a &quot;color breed&quot;. All ApHC-registered Appaloosas must be the offspring of two registered Appaloosa parents or a registered Appaloosa and a horse from an approved breed registry, which includes Arabian horses, Quarter Horses, and Thoroughbreds. In all cases, one parent must always be a regular registered Appaloosa. The only exception to the bloodline requirements is in the case of Appaloosa-colored geldings or spayed mares with unknown pedigrees; owners may apply for &quot;hardship registration&quot; for these non-breeding horses. The ApHC does not accept horses with draft, pony, Pinto, or Paint breeding, and requires mature Appaloosas to stand, unshod, at least . If a horse has excessive white markings not associated with the Appaloosa pattern (such as those characteristic of a pinto) it cannot be registered unless it is verified through DNA testing that both parents have ApHC registration.

Certain other characteristics are used to determine if a horse receives &quot;regular&quot; registration: striped hooves, white sclera visible when the eye is in a normal position, and mottled (spotted) skin around the eyes, lips, and genitalia. As the Appaloosa is one of the few horse breeds to exhibit skin mottling, this characteristic &quot;...is a very basic and decisive indication of an Appaloosa.&quot; Appaloosas born with visible coat pattern, or mottled skin and at least one other characteristic, are registered with &quot;regular&quot; papers and have full show and breeding privileges. A horse that meets bloodline requirements but is born without the recognized color pattern and characteristics can still be registered with the ApHC as a &quot;non-characteristic&quot; Appaloosa. These solid-colored, &quot;non-characteristic&quot; Appaloosas may not be shown at ApHC events unless the owner verifies the parentage through DNA testing and pays a supplementary fee to enter the horse into the ApHC&#x27;s Performance Permit Program (PPP).

=== Color rule controversy ===

During the 1940s and 1950s, when both the Appaloosa Horse Club (ApHC) and the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) were in their formative years, minimally marked or roan Appaloosas were sometimes used in Quarter Horse breeding programs. At the same time, it was noted that two solid-colored registered Quarter Horse parents would sometimes produce what Quarter Horse aficionados call a &quot;cropout&quot;, a foal with white coloration similar to that of an Appaloosa or Pinto. For a considerable time, until DNA testing could verify parentage, the AQHA refused to register such horses. The ApHC did accept cropout horses that exhibited proper Appaloosa traits, while cropout pintos became the core of the American Paint Horse Association. Famous Appaloosas who were cropouts included Colida, Joker B, Bright Eyes Brother and Wapiti.

In the late 1970s, the color controversy went in the opposite direction within the Appaloosa registry. The ApHC&#x27;s decision in 1982 to allow solid-colored or &quot;non-characteristic&quot; Appaloosas to be registered resulted in substantial debate within the Appaloosa breeding community. Until then, a foal of Appaloosa parents that had insufficient color was often denied registration, although non-characteristic Appaloosas were allowed into the registry. But breeder experience had shown that some solid Appaloosas could throw a spotted foal in a subsequent generation, at least when bred to a spotted Appaloosa. In addition, many horses with a solid coat exhibited secondary characteristics such as skin mottling, the white sclera, and striped hooves. The controversy stirred by the ApHC&#x27;s decision was intense. In 1983 a number of Appaloosa breeders opposed to the registration of solid-colored horses formed the American Appaloosa Association, a breakaway organization.

== Uses ==

Appaloosas are used extensively for both Western and English riding. Western competitions include cutting, reining, roping and O-Mok-See sports such as barrel racing (known as the Camas Prairie Stump Race in Appaloosa-only competition) and pole bending (called the Nez Percé Stake Race at breed shows). English disciplines they are used in include eventing, show jumping, and fox hunting. They are common in endurance riding competitions, as well as in casual trail riding. Appaloosas are also bred for horse racing, with an active breed racing association promoting the sport. They are generally used for middle-distance racing at distances between and ; an Appaloosa holds the all-breed record for the distance, set in 1989. 

Appaloosas are often used in Western movies and television series. Examples include &quot;Cojo Rojo&quot; in the Marlon Brando film &quot;The Appaloosa&quot;, &quot;Zip Cochise&quot; ridden by John Wayne in the 1966 film &quot;El Dorado&quot; and &quot;Cowboy&quot;, the mount of Matt Damon in &quot;True Grit&quot;. An Appaloosa horse is part of the controversial mascot team for the Florida State Seminoles, Chief Osceola and Renegade; even though the Seminole Tribe of Florida were not directly associated with Appaloosa horses.

=== Influence ===

There are several American horse breeds with leopard coloring and Appaloosa ancestry. These include the Pony of the Americas and the Colorado Ranger. Appaloosas were also crossbred with gaited horse breeds in an attempt to create leopard-spotted ambling horse breeds, including the Walkaloosa, the Spanish Jennet Horse, and the Tiger horse. Because such crossbred offspring are not eligible for ApHC registration, their owners have formed breed registries for horses with leopard complex patterns and gaited ability. In 1995 the Nez Perce tribe began a program to develop a new and distinct horse breed, the Nez Perce Horse, based on crossbreeding the Appaloosa with the Akhal-Teke breed from Central Asia. Appaloosa stallions have also been exported to Denmark to add new blood to the Knabstrupper breed.

== Health issues ==

=== Genetically linked vision issues ===
Two genetically-linked conditions are linked to blindness in Appaloosas, both associated with the Leopard complex color pattern.

Appaloosas have an eightfold greater risk of developing Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25 percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. Uveitis in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness. Eighty percent of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light-colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting the most at-risk individuals. Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease.

Appaloosas that are homozygous for the leopard complex (LP) gene are also at risk for congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). This form of night blindness has been linked with the leopard complex since the 1970s, and in 2007 a &quot;significant association&quot; between LP and CSNB was identified. CSNB is a disorder that causes an affected animal to lack night vision, although day vision is normal. It is an inherited disorder, present from birth, and does not progress over time. Studies in 2008 and 2010 indicate that both CSNB and leopard complex spotting patterns are linked to TRPM1.

=== Drug rules ===

In 2007 the ApHC implemented new drug rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs furosemide, known by the trade name of Lasix, and acetazolamide. Furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition, and is widely used in horse racing. Acetazolamide (&quot;Acet&quot;) is used for treating horses with the genetic disease hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures. Acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers. The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain American Quarter Horse bloodlines be tested for HYPP, and owners have the option to choose to place HYPP testing results on registration papers. Foals of AQHA-registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1, 2007 that carry HYPP will be required to be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers.

Both drugs are controversial, in part because they are considered drug maskers and diuretics that can make it difficult to detect the presence of other drugs in the horse&#x27;s system. On one side, it is argued that the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF), which sponsors show competition for many different horse breeds, and the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI), which governs international and Olympic equestrian competition, ban the use of furosemide. On the other side of the controversy, several major stock horse registries that sanction their own shows, including the American Quarter Horse Association, American Paint Horse Association, and the Palomino Horse Breeders of America, allow acetazolamide and furosemide to be used within 24 hours of showing under certain circumstances.

<text>A ziggurat (; Cuneiform: 𒅆𒂍𒉪, Akkadian: &#x27;, [[D-stem]] of&#x27; &#x27;to protrude, to build high&#x27;, cognate with other Semitic languages like Hebrew &quot;zaqar&quot; (זָקַר) &#x27;protrude&#x27;) is a type of massive structure built in ancient Mesopotamia. It has the form of a terraced compound of successively receding stories or levels. Notable ziggurats include the Great Ziggurat of Ur near Nasiriyah, the Ziggurat of Aqar Quf near Baghdad, the no longer extant Etemenanki in Babylon, Chogha Zanbil in Khūzestān and Sialk. The Sumerians believed that the gods lived in the temple at the top of the ziggurats, so only priests and other highly-respected individuals could enter. Sumerian society offered these individuals such gifts as music, harvested produce, and the creation of devotional statues to entice them to live in the temple.

==History==
The word ziggurat comes from &quot;ziqqurratum&quot; (height, pinnacle), in ancient Assyrian. From &quot;zaqārum&quot;, to be high up. The Ziggurat of Ur is a Neo-Sumerian ziggurat built by King Ur-Nammu, who dedicated it in honor of Nanna/Sîn in approximately the 21st century BC during the Third Dynasty of Ur.

==Description==
Ziggurats were built by ancient Sumerians, Akkadians, Elamites, Eblaites and Babylonians for local religions. Each ziggurat was part of a temple complex with other buildings. Before the ziggurats there were raised platforms that date from the Ubaid period during the sixth millennium BCE. The ziggurats began as platforms (usually oval, rectangular or square). The ziggurat was a mastaba-like structure with a flat top. The sun-baked bricks made up the core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the outside. Each step was slightly smaller than the step below it. The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had astrological significance. Kings sometimes had their names engraved on these glazed bricks. The number of floors ranged from two to seven.

According to archaeologist Harriet Crawford,

Access to the shrine would have been by a series of ramps on one side of the ziggurat or by a spiral ramp from base to summit. The Mesopotamian ziggurats were not places for public worship or ceremonies. They were believed to be dwelling places for the gods, and each city had its own patron god. Only priests were permitted on the ziggurat or in the rooms at its base, and it was their responsibility to care for the gods and attend to their needs. The priests were very powerful members of Sumerian and Assyro-Babylonian society.
One of the best-preserved ziggurats is Chogha Zanbil in western Iran. The Sialk ziggurat, in Kashan, Iran, is the oldest known ziggurat, dating to the early 3rd millennium BCE. Ziggurat designs ranged from simple bases upon which a temple sat, to marvels of mathematics and construction which spanned several terraced stories and were topped with a temple.

An example of a simple ziggurat is the White Temple of Uruk, in ancient Sumer. The ziggurat itself is the base on which the White Temple is set. Its purpose is to get the temple closer to the heavens, and provide access from the ground to it via steps. The Mesopotamians believed that these pyramid temples connected heaven and earth. In fact, the ziggurat at Babylon was known as Etemenanki, which means &quot;House of the foundation of heaven and earth&quot; in Sumerian.

The date of its original construction is unknown, with suggested dates ranging from the fourteenth to the ninth century BC, with textual evidence suggesting it existed in the second millennium. Unfortunately, not much of even the base is left of this massive structure, yet archeological findings and historical accounts put this tower at seven multicolored tiers, topped with a temple of exquisite proportions. The temple is thought to have been painted and maintained an indigo color, matching the tops of the tiers. It is known that there were three staircases leading to the temple, two of which (side flanked) were thought to have only ascended half the ziggurat&#x27;s height.

==Interpretation and significance==

According to Herodotus, at the top of each ziggurat was a shrine, although none of these shrines has survived. Functionally, ziggurats offered a high place on which priests could escape rising water that annually inundated lowlands and occasionally flooded for hundreds of kilometres. They also offered security; since the shrine was accessible only by way of three stairways, a small number of guards could prevent non-priests from spying on the rituals at the shrine on top of the ziggurat, such as initiation rituals like the Eleusinian mysteries, cooking of sacrificial food and burning of sacrificial animals. Each ziggurat was part of a temple complex that included a courtyard, storage rooms, bathrooms, and living quarters, around which a city spread, as well as a place for the people to worship. It was considered to be a sacred structure.

== Influence ==
The biblical account of the Tower of Babel has been associated by modern scholars to the massive construction undertakings of the ziggurats of Mesopotamia, and in particular to the ziggurat of Etemenanki in Babylon in light of the Tower of Babel Stele describing its restoration by Nebuchadnezzar II.

According to some historians the design of Egyptian pyramids, especially the stepped designs of the oldest pyramids (Pyramid of Zoser at Saqqara, 2600 BCE), may have been an evolution from the ziggurats built in Mesopotamia. Others say the Pyramid of Zoser and the earliest Egyptian pyramids may have been derived locally from the bench-shaped mastaba tomb.

The shape of the ziggurat experienced a revival in modern architecture and Brutalist architecture starting in the 1970s. The Al Zaqura Building is a government building situated in Baghdad. It serves the office of the prime minister of Iraq. The Babylon Hotel in Baghdad also is inspired by the ziggurat. The Chet Holifield Federal Building is colloquially known as &quot;the Ziggurat&quot; due to its form. It is a United States government building in Laguna Niguel, California, built between 1968 and 1971. Further examples include The Ziggurat in West Sacramento, California, and the SIS Building in London.

<text>Eurytion (Ancient Greek: Εὐρυτίων, &quot;widely honoured&quot;) or Eurythion (Εὐρυθίων) was a name attributed to several individuals in Greek mythology:

*Eurytion, the king of Phthia.
*Eurytion, a Centaur of Arcadia who demanded to marry the daughter of Dexamenus of Olenus, either Mnesimache or Deianira, or who threatened violence against his daughter Hippolyte on the day of her marriage to Azan. Her father was forced to agree, but Heracles intervened on her behalf and killed the wild horse-man.
*Eurytion, another Centaur, of Thessaly, who attempted to carry off the bride of Peirithous, king of the Lapiths, on their wedding day. He and his fellows were killed in the fight with the Lapiths that followed, the Centauromachy. Ovid refers to him as &quot;Eurytus&quot;, and by his Latinized Greek name &quot;Eurytion&quot;.
*Eurytion, and the two-headed dog Orthrus, were the guardians of the cattle of Geryon and were killed by Heracles.
*Eurytion, a Trojan archer during the Trojan War, son of Lycaon and brother of Pandarus. He participated in the funeral games of Anchises.
*Eurytion, a defender of Thebes against the Seven, was killed by Parthenopaeus.
* Eurytion, an alternate name for a Gigas who was slain by Artemis.

<text>In Greek mythology, the name Thessalus is attributed to the following individuals, all of whom were considered possible eponyms of Thessaly.

*Thessalus, son of Haemon, son of Chlorus, son of Pelasgus.
*Thessalus, son of Poseidon and one of the reputed father of Minyas, founder of Minyan Orchomenus.
*Thessalus, son of Jason and Medea, the twin of Alcimenes and older brother of Tisandrus. He escaped being murdered by his mother and, after the death of Acastus, became king of Iolcus.
*Thessalus, also called Thettalus, son of Heracles and Chalciope. He was the father of Antiphus, Pheidippus and Nesson. After the Carians settled at Calydna and Nisyros, Thessalus took possession of both islands later.

<text>In Greek mythology, Astydamea or Astydamia (; Ancient Greek: Ἀστυδάμεια &quot;Astudámeia&quot;, derived from ἄστυ &quot;ástu&quot;, &quot;town&quot;, and δαμάω &quot;damáo&quot;, &quot;to tame&quot;) is a name attributed to several individuals:
* Astydamia (wife of Acastus), also known as Hippolyta, daughter of Cretheus and queen of Iolcus as the wife of Acastus. Her husband purified Peleus of the murder of King Eurytion of Phthia. Astydameia fell in love with Peleus but he scorned her, so she told Acastus that Peleus had tried to rape her. Acastus took Peleus on hunting trip and left him unprotected to a Centaurs attacked. Peleus escaped death and later pillaged Iolcus and killed Astydameia.
* Astydamea, daughter of Pelops and Hippodamia. She married Alcaeus and had Amphitryon and Anaxo by him. In other accounts, the wife of Alcaeus was named Hipponome, daughter of Menoeceus or Laonome, daughter of Guneus.
* Astydamea, daughter of Phorbas and mother of Lepreus by Caucon, son of Poseidon. She persuaded Heracles to reconcile with her son, who had previously advised Augeas to cast Heracles in bonds.
* Astydamea, mother of Ctesippus by Heracles. In one source, she was the daughter of Amyntor, possibly by Kleoboule or Hippodameia. Another account makes her the daughter of Ormenus, king of Ormenion. Heracles, the same source relates, wooed her, but Ormenius would not marry her to him since Heracles was already married to Deianira. Heracles then led a war against Ormenius, killed him and took Astydameia by force. Astydameia (or Astygeneia) is also an alternate name for Astyoche, daughter of Phylas, who bore Heracles a son Tlepolemus.
* Astydamea, was briefly mentioned by a scholiast on Euripides as the daughter of Strophius and Cydragora and sister of Pylades.

*Phocus, son of Aeacus and Psamathe, also possible eponym of Phocis according to a scholiast on the &quot;Iliad&quot;.
* Phocus, son of Ornytion.
* Phocus, father of Callirhoe.
*Phocus, father of Manthea(seems to be a variation of the Callisto story) who consorted with Zeus(who was in the form of a bear) and became the mother of Arctos(seems to be variation of the character of Arcas) by the god according to clementine literature,Recognitions.The figure is mentioned by the literature to criticize the evils of polytheism in the views of christianity, specifically focusing on adulteries of Zeus.
* Phocus and Priasus, two sons of Caeneus, were counted among the Argonauts.
*Phocus the builder, son of Danaus, is mentioned by Hyginus among the Achaeans against Troy, but is otherwise unknown. Epeius, builder of the Trojan Horse, was a grandson of Phocus the son of Aeacus.

Phocus is also the name of the son of Phocion.

<text>In Greek mythology, Psamathe () is a Nereid, one of the fifty daughters of the sea god Nereus and the Oceanid Doris. By Aeacus, the king of Aegina, she is the mother of a son, Phocus. When Phocus is killed by his half-brothers Peleus and Telamon, Psamathe sends a giant wolf at Peleus&#x27;s herd.

== Family ==

Psamathe is one of the fifty Nereids, daughters of Nereus and Doris. By Aeacus, the king of Aegina, she is the mother of a son, Phocus. She is later the wife of Proteus, king of Egypt, by whom she has a son, Theoclymenos, and a daughter, Eido (later known as Theonoe).

== Mythology ==

There are two myths which involve Psamathe. The first is the story of her violation by Aeacus. Upon his advances, she transforms herself into a seal in an attempt to escape. She is unsuccessful, however, and from their union is born Phocus, whose name (&quot;phoke&quot; meaning &quot;seal&quot;) recalls his mother&#x27;s metamorphosis.

Peleus and Telamon are the sons of Aeacus by his wife Endeis. The two of them kill their half-brother Phocus, and they are subsequently exiled from Aegina by their father. The second story which features Psamathe involves her sending of a wolf at the herds of Peleus, out of revenge for her son&#x27;s death. After the wolf eats part of Peleus&#x27;s herd, it is turned to stone by either Psamathe herself, or her sister Thetis.

== Sources ==

Psamathe is first mentioned in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; (c. 730–700 BC), where she described as &quot;Psamathe of charming figure&quot; and &quot;the fair goddess&quot;. Hesiod lists her among the Nereids, and calls her the mother of Phocus by Aeacus. Pindar (c. 518–438 BC), who calls her &quot;Psamatheia&quot; (&quot;Ψαμάθεια&quot;), says that she bore Phocus by the shore of the sea, while Euripides, in his play Helen (c. 412 BC), offers a very different account of Psamathe, in which, &quot;after she left Aiakos&#x27;s bed&quot;, she is the wife of Proteus, the king of Egypt, by whom she has two children, Theoclymenos and Eido (the latter of which is later known as Theonoe).

The myth of Psmathe&#x27;s transformation into a seal comes from the mythographer Apollodorus (first or second century AD) and a scholiast on Euripides&#x27;s play &quot;Andromache&quot;, while multiple versions of the story of the wolf are given by different authors. Ovid, in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (c. 8 AD), presents the most detailed account. After Phocus is killed by his half-brothers Peleus and Telamon, they are exiled from the island of Aegina by their father Aeacus. Psamathe, out of revenge for her son&#x27;s murder, sends at Peleus&#x27;s herd of cattle a wolf that is described as a &quot;huge beast&quot;, with &quot;great, murderous jaws&quot; and &quot;eyes blazing with red fire&quot;. Peleus is informed of the wolf by his herdsman, and &quot;well [knows] that the bereaved Nereid [is] sending this calamity upon him&quot;. In desperation, he prays to Psamathe to &quot;put away her wrath and come to his help&quot;; she remains unmoved, however, until her sister Thetis prays for her forgiveness alongside Peleus, at which point she transforms the wolf into what Ovid describes as &quot;marble&quot;. Antoninus Liberalis (second to third century AD), in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, presents a much briefer version, which he attributes to Nicander of Colophon (second century BC). In this version the origin of the wolf is not specified, and it is transformed into stone, not by Psamathe, but by &quot;divine will&quot;. A wolf is similarly mentioned by the Hellenistic poet Lycophron (born 330–325 BC), in his &quot;Alexandra&quot;: &quot;... the Wolf that devoured the atonement and was turned to stone ...&quot;. The byzantine poet John Tzetzes (c. 1110–1180), in his commentary on Lycophron&#x27;s &quot;Alexandra&quot;, presents a version of the story in which Psamathe sends the wolf, but does not transform it herself; instead it is Thetis who turns it to stone.

Psamathe also appears in book 43 of Nonnus&#x27;s &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; (c. fifth century AD), during the fight between Poseidon and Dionysus, where, from the beach, she pleads to Zeus to end the battle.

== Iconography ==

Psamathe is depicted on a number of Attic vases dating from the late fifth century BC. The iconography of Psamathe is typical for a Nereid, and she is depicted in such scenes as the fight between Peleus and Thetis, and the transportation of the weapons and armour of Achilles, where she is among the Nereids carrying his weaponry while riding on a dolphin.

<text>The Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is a private research university in Henrietta, New York, a suburb of Rochester. It was founded in 1829. It is one of only two institutes of technology in New York state, the other being the New York Institute of Technology.

RIT enrolls about 19,000 students, of whom 16,000 are undergraduate and 3,000 are graduate students. These students come from all 50 states in the United States and more than 100 countries. The university has more than 4,000 faculty and staff. It also has branches abroad in China, Croatia, Kosovo, and the United Arab Emirates. The university is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

==History==
The university began as a result of an 1891 merger between Rochester Athenæum, a struggling literary society founded in 1829 by Colonel Nathaniel Rochester and associates, and The Mechanics Institute, a Rochester school of practical technical training for local residents founded in 1885 by a consortium of local businessmen including Captain Henry Lomb, co-founder of Bausch &amp; Lomb. The name of the merged institution at the time was called Rochester Athenæum and Mechanics Institute (RAMI). The Mechanics Institute was considered as the surviving school and took over The Rochester Athenæum&#x27;s 1829 founding charter. From the time of the merger until 1944, many of its students, administration and faculty staff alike, not only celebrated the former Mechanics Institute&#x27;s 1885 founding charter, but its former name as well. In 1944, the school changed its name to Rochester Institute of Technology, re-established The Athenæum&#x27;s 1829 founding charter and became a full-fledged research university.
The university originally resided within the city of Rochester, New York, proper, on a block bounded by the Erie Canal, South Plymouth Avenue, Spring Street, and South Washington Street (approximately ). Its art department was originally located in the Bevier Memorial Building. By the middle of the twentieth century, RIT began to outgrow its facilities, and surrounding land was scarce and expensive; additionally, in 1959, the New York Department of Public Works announced a new freeway, the Inner Loop, was to be built through the city along a path that bisected the university&#x27;s campus and required demolition of key university buildings. In 1961, a donation of $3.27 million from local Grace Watson, for whom RIT&#x27;s dining hall was later named, allowed the university to purchase land for a new campus several miles south along the east bank of the Genesee River in suburban Henrietta. Upon completion in 1968, the university moved to the new suburban campus, where it resides today.

In 1966, RIT was selected by the federal government to be the site of the newly founded National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID). NTID admitted its first students in 1968, concurrent with RIT&#x27;s transition to the Henrietta campus.

In 1979, RIT took over Eisenhower College, a liberal arts college located in Seneca Falls, New York. Despite making a 5-year commitment to keep Eisenhower open, RIT announced in July 1982 that the college would close immediately. One final year of operation by Eisenhower&#x27;s academic program took place in the 1982–83 school year on the Henrietta campus. The final Eisenhower graduation took place in May 1983 back in Seneca Falls.

The microelectronic engineering program, created in 1982 and the only ABET-accredited undergraduate program in the country, was the nation&#x27;s first Bachelor of Science program specializing in the fabrication of semiconductor devices and integrated circuits. In 1990, RIT started its first PhD program, in imaging science – the first PhD program of its kind in the U.S. The information technology program was the first nationally recognized IT degree, created in 1993. In 1996, RIT became the first college in the U.S. to offer a Software Engineering degree at the undergraduate level.

==Campus==
The main campus is housed on a property. This property is largely covered with woodland and fresh-water swamp making it a very diverse wetland that is home to a number of somewhat rare plant species. The campus comprises 237 buildings and of building space. The nearly universal use of bricks in the campus&#x27;s construction – estimated at 15,710,693 bricks as of August 6, 2018 – prompted students to give it the semi-affectionate nickname &quot;Brick City,&quot; reflected in the name of events such as the annual &quot;Brick City Homecoming.&quot; Though the buildings erected in the first few decades of the campus&#x27;s existence reflected the architectural style known as brutalism, the warm color of the bricks softened the impact somewhat. More recent additions to the campus have diversified the architecture while still incorporating the traditional brick colors. The main campus was listed as a census-designated place in 2020.

In 2009, the campus was named a &quot;Campus Sustainability Leader&quot; by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.

The residence halls and the academic side of campus are connected with a walkway called the &quot;Quarter Mile&quot;. Along the Quarter Mile, between the academic and residence hall side are various administration and support buildings. On the academic side of the walkway is a courtyard, known as the Infinity Quad due to a striking polished stainless steel sculpture (by Jose&#x27; de Rivera, 1968, 19&#x27;×8&#x27;×2&#x27;) of a continuous ribbon-like Möbius strip (commonly referred to as the infinity loop because if the sun hits the strip at a certain angle it will cast a shadow in the shape of an infinity symbol on the ground) in the middle of it; on the residence hall side is a sundial and a clock. Standing near the Administration Building and the Student Alumni Union is The Sentinel, a steel structure created by the acclaimed metal sculptor, Albert Paley. Reaching high and weighing 110 tons, the sculpture is the largest on any American university campus. There are four RIT-owned apartment complexes: Global Village, Perkins Green, Riverknoll, and University Commons.
Along the Quarter Mile is the Gordon Field House, a , two-story athletic center. Opened in 2004 and named in honor of Lucius &quot;Bob&quot; Gordon and his wife Marie, the Field House hosts numerous campus and community activities, including concerts, career fairs, athletic competitions, graduations, and other functions. Other facilities between the residence halls and academic buildings include the Hale-Andrews Student Life Center, Student Alumni Union, Ingle Auditorium, Clark Gymnasium, Frank Ritter Memorial Ice Arena, and the Schmitt Interfaith Center.

===Art on campus===
The RIT Art Collection, part of the RIT Archive Collections at RIT Libraries, comprises thousands of works, including hundreds by RIT faculty, students, and alumni. The collection grows every year through the Purchase Prize Program, which enables the university to purchase select art works from students in the School of Art and Design, the School for American Crafts, and the School of Photographic Arts and Sciences.

Many pieces from the collection are on public display around campus, including:
* &quot;Sentinel&quot; – a 73-foot-tall sculpture created by the acclaimed metal sculptor, Albert Paley, located on Administration Circle.
* &quot;Growth and Youth&quot; – a set of two murals by Josef Albers located in the lobby of the George Eastman Building.
* &quot;Principia&quot; – a mural by Larry Kirkland that is etched into the black granite floor of the atrium in the College of Science (Gosnell Hall). The work features illustrations, symbols, formulae, quotes, and images representing milestones in the history of science.
* &quot;Three Piece Reclining Figure No. 1&quot; – a bronze sculpture by English artist Henry Moore located in Eastman Kodak Quad.
* &quot;Grand Hieroglyph&quot; – a 24-foot-long tapestry by Shiela Hicks located in the George Eastman Building.
* &quot;Sundial&quot; – a sculpture by Alistair Bevington located on the Residence Quad.
* &quot;The Monument to Ephemeral Facts&quot; – a mixed media sculpture by Douglas Holleley located in Wallace Library.
* &quot;Unity&quot; – a 24-foot-tall stainless steel sculpture sited between the College of Art and Design, the College of Engineering Technology, and the College of Engineering.

===Demographics===
The RIT campus is a census-designated place (CDP) with a population of 7,322 at the 2020 census.

&quot;Note: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category. This table excludes Latinos from the racial categories and assigns them to a separate category. Hispanics/Latinos can be of any race.&quot;

==Organization and administration==

As of 2017, the president is David C. Munson, formerly the dean of engineering at the University of Michigan. Munson, the university&#x27;s tenth president, took office on July 1, 2017, replacing William W. Destler, who retired after 10 years at RIT. Prabu David, formerly vice provost at Michigan State University, was named provost in August 2023. He replaced Ellen Granberg, the first woman to serve in that role at RIT.

The school is also a member of the Association of Independent Technological Universities.

===Colleges===
RIT has nine colleges:
* College of Art and Design
* Saunders College of Business
* Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences
* Kate Gleason College of Engineering
* College of Engineering Technology
* College of Health Sciences and Technology
* College of Liberal Arts
* National Technical Institute for the Deaf
* College of Science

There are also two smaller academic units that grant RIT degrees but do not have full college faculties:
* Golisano Institute for Sustainability
* School of Individualized Study

In addition to these colleges, RIT operates three branch campuses in Europe, one in the Middle East and one in East Asia:
* RIT Croatia (formerly the American College of Management and Technology) in Dubrovnik and Zagreb, Croatia
* RIT Kosovo (formerly the American University in Kosovo) in Pristina, Kosovo
* RIT Dubai in Dubai, United Arab Emirates
* RIT China – Weihai

==Academics==

The university is chartered by the New York state legislature and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The university offers more than 200 academic programs, including seven doctoral programs across its nine constituent colleges. In 2008–2009, RIT awarded 2,483 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 912 master&#x27;s degrees, 10 doctorates, and 523 other certificates and diplomas.

The four-year, full-time undergraduate program constitutes the majority of enrollments at the university and emphasizes instruction in the &quot;arts &amp; sciences/professions.&quot; RIT is a member of the Rochester Area College consortium, which allows students to register at other colleges in the Rochester metropolitan area without tuition charges. RIT&#x27;s full-time undergraduate and graduate programs used to operate on an approximately 10-week quarter system with the primary three academic quarters beginning on Labor Day in early September and ending in late May. In August 2013, RIT transitioned from a quarter system to a semester system. The change was hotly debated on campus, with a majority of students opposed according to an informal survey; Student Government also voted against the change.

Among the eight colleges, 6.8% of the student body is enrolled in the Saunders College of Business, 15.0% in the Kate Gleason College of Engineering, 4.3% in the College of Liberal Arts, 25.4% in the College of Applied Science and Technology, 18.0% in the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences, 13.9% in the College of Imaging Arts and Science, 5.7% in the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, and 9.2% in the College of Science. The five most commonly awarded degrees are in Business Administration, Engineering Technology, School of Photographic Arts &amp; Sciences, School of Art and Design, and Information Technology.

RIT has struggled with student retention, although the situation has improved during president Destler&#x27;s tenure. 91.3% of freshmen in the fall of 2009 registered for fall 2010 classes, which Destler noted as a school record.

===Student body===

RIT enrolled 13,711 undergraduate and 3,131 graduate students in fall 2015. Admissions are characterized as &quot;more selective, higher transfer-in&quot; by the Carnegie Foundation. RIT received 12,725 applications for undergraduate admission in Fall 2008, 60% were admitted, 34% enrolled, and 84% of students re-matriculated as second-year students. The interquartile range on the SAT was 1630–1910. 26% of students graduated after four years and 64% after six years. As of 2013, the 25th–75th percentile SAT scores are 540–650 Critical Reading, 570–680 Math, and 520–630 Writing—the average composite score being 1630–1960.

===Rankings===
In 2017, RIT was ranked No. 97 (tie) in the National Universities category by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.
Business Insider ranked RIT No. 14 in Northeast and No. 36 in the country for Computer Science.
RIT was ranked among the top 50 national universities in a national survey of &quot;High School Counselors Top College Picks&quot;.
RIT&#x27;s Saunders College of Business ranked No. 26 in the United States for &quot;Best Online MBA Programs&quot; for the online executive MBA program by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;/&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; ranked the MBA program at Saunders College of Business No. 54 among business colleges and universities around the world for the year 2019.
RIT was ranked among the top 20 universities recognized for excellent co-operative learning and internship programs. It was further placed at No. 24 in the top 30 universities for Computer Science with the best Returns on Investment (ROI) in the US.

The Princeton Review ranked RIT No. 8 nationally for &quot;top schools for video game design for 2019&quot; in undergraduate programs and No. 7 in graduate programs. Among the top 75 universities for Video Game Design in the US, RIT was ranked No. 4.

===Co-op program===
RIT&#x27;s co-op program, which began in 1912, is the fourth-oldest in the world. It is also the fifth-largest in the nation, with approximately 3,500 students completing a co-op each year at over 2,000 businesses. The program requires (or allows, depending on major) students to work in the workplace for up to five quarters alternating with quarters of class. The amount of co-op varies by major, usually between 3 and 5 three-month &quot;blocks&quot; or academic quarters. Many employers prefer students to co-op for two consecutive blocks, referred to as a &quot;double-block co-op&quot;. During a co-op, the student is not required to pay tuition to the school and is still considered a &quot;full time&quot; student. 

===Library and special collections===
RIT library services are based in the Wallace Library. The Cary Graphic Arts Collection contains books, manuscripts, printing-type specimens, letterpress printing equipment, documents, and other artifacts related to the history of graphic communication. RIT Archives document more than 180 years of the university&#x27;s history, and students in the Museum Studies program frequently work with these artifacts and help create exhibitions. The RIT/NTID Deaf Studies Archive preserves and illustrates the history, art, culture, technology, and language of the Deaf community. The RIT Art Collection contains thousands of works showcasing RIT&#x27;s visual arts curriculum.

===Vignelli Center for Design Studies===
The Vignelli Center for Design Studies was established in 2010 and houses the archives of Italian designers Massimo and Lella Vignelli. The center is a hub for design education, scholarship and research.

===ESL Global Cybersecurity Institute===

Founded in 2020, the Global Cybersecurity Institute was funded in part by a $50 million gift from RIT alumnus Austin McChord. The gift also funded four named endowments for students and cybersecurity researchers. In 2022, the Institute received a $3 million naming gift from ESL Federal Credit Union, a Rochester-area company that provides banking and wealth management services.

==Research==
The total value of research grants to university faculty for fiscal year 2022 totaled $92 million. The university currently offers twelve PhD programs: Imaging science, Microsystems Engineering, Computing and Information Sciences, Color science, Astrophysical Sciences and Technology, Sustainability, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Biomedical and Chemical Engineering, Business Administration, Physics, and Mathematical Modeling.

In 1986, RIT founded the Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science, and started its first doctoral program in Imaging Science in 1989. The Imaging Science department also offers the only Bachelors (BS) and Masters (MS) degree programs in imaging science in the country. The Carlson Center features a diverse research portfolio; its major research areas include Digital Image Restoration, Remote Sensing, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Printing Systems Research, Color Science, Nanoimaging, Imaging Detectors, Astronomical Imaging, Visual Perception, and Ultrasonic Imaging.

The Center for Advancing the Study of CyberInfrastructure (CASCI) is a multidisciplinary center housed in the College of Computing and Information Sciences. The Departments of Computer science, Software Engineering, Information technology, Computer engineering, Imaging Science, and Bioinformatics collaborate in a variety of research programs at this center. RIT was the first university to launch a Bachelor&#x27;s program in Information technology in 1991, the first university to launch a Bachelor&#x27;s program in Software Engineering in 1996, and was also among the first universities to launch a Computer science Bachelor&#x27;s program in 1972. RIT helped standardize the Forth programming language, and developed the CLAWS software package.

RIT has collaborated with many industry players in the field of research as well, including IBM, Xerox, Rochester&#x27;s &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot;, Siemens, NASA, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 2005, it was announced by Russell W. Bessette, Executive Director New York State Office of Science Technology &amp; Academic Research (NYSTAR), that RIT will lead the University at Buffalo and Alfred University in an initiative to create key technologies in microsystems, photonics, nanomaterials, and remote sensing systems and to integrate next generation IT systems. In addition, the collaboratory is tasked with helping to facilitate economic development and tech transfer in New York State. More than 35 other notable organizations have joined the collaboratory, including Boeing, Eastman Kodak, IBM, Intel, SEMATECH, ITT, Motorola, Xerox, and several Federal agencies, including as NASA.

In 2017, the U.S. Department of Energy selected RIT to lead its Reducing Embodied-Energy and Decreasing Emissions (REMADE) Institute aimed at forging new clean energy measures through the Manufacturing USA initiative.

==Athletics==

RIT was a long-time member of the Empire 8, an NCAA Division III athletic conference, but moved to the Liberty League beginning with the 2011–2012 academic year. All of RIT&#x27;s teams compete at the Division III level, with the exception of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey programs. Those teams play at the Division I level in Atlantic Hockey America, formed after the 2023–24 season by the merger of the Tigers&#x27; former hockey homes of the men-only Atlantic Hockey Association and the women-only College Hockey America. In 2010, the men&#x27;s ice hockey team was the first ever from the Atlantic Hockey Association to reach the NCAA tournament semi-finals: The Frozen Four.

In 2011–2012, the RIT women&#x27;s ice hockey team had a regular season record of 28–1–1, and won the NCAA Division III national championship, defeating the defending champion Norwich University 4–1. The women&#x27;s team had carried a record of 54–3–3 over their past two regular seasons leading up to that point. The women&#x27;s hockey team then moved from Division III to Division I. Starting in the 2012–2013 season, the women&#x27;s team played in the College Hockey America conference. In 2014–2015, the team became eligible for NCAA Division I postseason play.

In 2021, the RIT men&#x27;s lacrosse team beat Salisbury in double overtime to take the NCAA Division III national championship. In 2022, the RIT men&#x27;s lacrosse team won a second national title, following a 12–10 victory over Union College.

RIT&#x27;s Alpine Ski Club competes at United States Collegiate Ski &amp; Snowboard Association (USCSA), which uses NCAA II competition and academic standards. The varsity Alpine Ski Team competes at the USCSA Mid East Region.

Tom Coughlin, coach of the NFL&#x27;s 2008 and 2012 Super Bowl champion New York Giants, taught physical education and was the head coach of the RIT Men&#x27;s Varsity Football team for four seasons in the early 1970s. Overseeing RIT football&#x27;s transition from a club sport to an NCAA Division III team, this was the first head coaching job of Coughlin&#x27;s career with him calling his time at RIT &quot;a great experience.&quot;

Since 1968 RIT&#x27;s hockey teams played at Frank Ritter Memorial Ice Arena on campus. In 2010, RIT began raising money for a new arena. In 2011, B. Thomas Golisano and the Polisseni Foundation donated $4.5 million for the new arena, which came to be named the Gene Polisseni Center.

===Mascot===

RIT&#x27;s athletics nickname is the &quot;Tigers&quot;, a name given following the undefeated men&#x27;s basketball season of 1955–56. Prior to that, RIT&#x27;s athletic teams were called the &quot;Techmen&quot; and had blue and silver as the sports colors. In 1963, RIT students fundraised using ‘Tigershares’ to buy a rescued Bengal tiger cub that became the university&#x27;s mascot, named SpiRIT which stands for Student Pride in RIT. Ambitious students were trained as the Tiger Cubs handlers and took him to most sport events until 1964. It was then discovered that the cub was ill and eventually he was put down due to these health complications. The original tiger&#x27;s pelt now resides in the RIT Archive Collections at RIT Libraries. RIT helped the Seneca Park Zoo purchase a new tiger shortly after SpiRIT&#x27;s death, but it was not used as a school mascot. A bronze sculpture by D.H.S. Wehle in the center of the Henrietta campus now provides an everlasting version of the mascot.

A costumed tiger mascot named RITchie was later introduced, appearing at a variety of campus events. The name was selected as part of a student contest in 1989.

==Student life==
In addition to its academic and athletic endeavors, RIT has over 150 student clubs, 10 major student organizations, an interfaith center and 30 different Greek organizations.

&quot;Reporter&quot; magazine, founded in 1951, is the university&#x27;s primary student-run magazine. RIT also has its own ambulance corps, bi-weekly television athletics program RIT SportsZone, pep band, radio station, and tech crew.

The university&#x27;s Gordon Field House and Activities Center is home to competitive and recreational athletics and aquatics, a fitness center, and an auditorium hosting frequent concerts and other entertainment. Its opening in late 2004 was inaugurated by concerts by performers including Kanye West and Bob Dylan. It is the second-largest venue in Monroe County.

===Deaf and hard-of-hearing students===
One of RIT&#x27;s unique features is the large presence of deaf and hard-of-hearing students, who make up 8.8% of the student body. The National Technical Institute for the Deaf, one of RIT&#x27;s nine colleges, provides interpreting and captioning services to students for classes and events. Many courses&#x27; lectures at RIT are interpreted into American Sign Language or captioned in real-time for the benefit of hard-of-hearing and deaf students. There are several deaf and hard-of-hearing professors and lecturers, too; an interpreter can vocalize their lectures for hearing students. This significant portion of the RIT population provides another dynamic to the school&#x27;s diversity, and it has contributed to Rochester&#x27;s high number of deaf residents per capita.
===Fraternities and sororities===
RIT&#x27;s campus is host to thirty fraternities and sororities (eighteen fraternities and twelve sororities), that make up 6.5% of the total RIT population. RIT and Phi Kappa Psi alumni built six large buildings for Greek students on the academic side of campus next to the Riverknoll apartments. In addition to these six houses, there is also limited space within the residence halls for another six chapters.

===Special Interest Houses===
RIT&#x27;s dormitories are home to six &quot;Special Interest Houses&quot; — Art House, Computer Science House, Engineering House, House of General Science, Photo House, and Unity House — that provide an environment to live immersed in a specific interest, such as art, engineering, or computing. Members of a special-interest house share their interests with each other and the rest of campus through academic focus and special activities. Special Interest Houses are self-governing and accept members based on their own criteria. In the early 2000s, RIT had a Special Interest House called Business Leaders for Tomorrow, but it no longer exists. Prior to the 2022–2023 academic year, RIT had a Special Interest House called &quot;International House&quot;, but it no longer exists.

===ROTC programs===
RIT is the host of the Air Force ROTC Detachment 538 &quot;Blue Tigers&quot; and the Army ROTC &quot;Tiger Battalion&quot;. RIT students may also enroll in the Naval ROTC program based at the University of Rochester.

In 2009, the &quot;Tiger Battalion&quot; was awarded the Eastern Region&#x27;s Outstanding ROTC Unit Award, given annually by the Order of the Founders and Patriots of America. In 2010, it was awarded the National MacArthur Award for 2nd Brigade.

===Reporter Magazine===
Reporter magazine (&quot;Reporter&quot;) is a completely student-run organization. The magazine is a 32-page full-color issue distributed on the first Monday of the month for the duration of the academic year, supplemented with regular online content.

&quot;Reporter&quot; began as a newspaper in 1951 and changed to a magazine format in 1969 to better showcase the talents of students enrolled in programs at the College of Imaging Arts &amp; Sciences. The first magazine issue was released on January 10, 1969. The magazine continued to be released on a weekly cycle until 2013.

===K2GXT – RIT Amateur Radio Club===
Students interested in amateur radio can join K2GXT, the RIT amateur radio club. It is the oldest club on campus, founded in 1952 at the original downtown Rochester campus. The club maintains a UHF and VHF amateur radio repeater system operating on the 2 meter band, and the 70 centimeter band. The repeater system serves the campus and surrounding areas.

===WITR 89.7===

An FM radio station run by students at RIT, WITR 89.7 broadcasts various music genres, RIT athletic events, and several talk radio programs.

===College Activities Board===
The College Activities Board, frequently abbreviated as CAB, is a student-run organization responsible for providing &quot;diverse entertainment and activities to enhance student life on the RIT campus.&quot; CAB is responsible for annual concerts, class trips, movie screenings, and other frequent events.

===Imagine RIT===

An annual festival, publicized as &quot;Imagine RIT&quot;, was initiated in May 2008 to showcase innovative and creative activity at RIT. It is one of the most prominent changes brought to RIT by former university president, William Destler.

An open event, visitors to Imagine RIT have an opportunity to tour the RIT campus and view new ideas for products and services, admire fine art, explore faculty and student research, examine engineering design projects, and interact with hundreds of hands-on exhibits. Theatrical and musical performances take place on stages in many locations on the RIT campus. Intended to appeal to visitors of all ages, including children, the festival features a variety of exhibits. More than 17,000 people attended the inaugural festival on May 3, 2008, and ten years later the number of people attending has doubled, reaching almost 35,000.

===Rochester Game Festival===
Sponsored by RIT&#x27;s MAGIC Center, ROC Game Dev, and the Irondequoit Library, the Rochester Game Festival is an annual convention that showcases video games and tabletop games produced by students and by independent developers in the surrounding region. More than 1,300 people attended the festival in 2019.

===RIT Ambulance===
RIT Ambulance (RITA) is a community run, 9-1-1 dispatched New York State Certified Basic Life Support Ambulance agency. 

===Public Safety===
RIT Public Safety is the primary agency responsible for the protection of students, staff, and property, as well as enforcement of both college policies and state laws. Officers are NYS Licensed Security Guards who possess an expanded scope of authority under NYS Education Law, and many Officers have prior law enforcement backgrounds. In 2016, it was announced that RIT Public Safety will deploy officers armed with long guns to respond to active shooter incidents. Public Safety Officers operate both a dispatch center and various types of patrol units on campus and at off-campus holdings (such as The Inn and Conference Center) and also manage the Call Box System. Activating a call box will automatically place the user in touch with an Officer in the dispatch center who will direct Patrol Officers to respond to the location; if necessary, Officers will summon the Monroe County Sheriff&#x27;s to respond as well. As the college does not have 24/7 on campus crisis intervention counselors, in the event of a mental or behavioral health incident during hours where a counselor is not available, Public Safety Officers are also trained to act as mediators until an on-call counselor can be summoned.

===Dining services===
RIT Dining Services manages a large number of restaurants and food shops, along with the sole dining hall on campus. There are multiple cafeterias and small retail locations throughout the campus, including near the Residence Halls, in the Student Alumni Union, Global Village, and in certain academic buildings. Dining Services at RIT is completely internal and run through the university. RIT Dining Services also provides opportunities for international students to work on campus. In early 2019 the campus started providing food from a Hydroponic farm on campus that supplied lettuce, kale, and other crops.
==Governance==
RIT is governed under a shared governance model. The shared governance system is composed of the Student Government, the Staff Council, and the Academic Senate. The University Council brings together representatives from all three groups and makes recommendations to the president of the university. Once the University Council has made a recommendation, the president makes the final decision.

===Student Government===
The Student Government consists of an elected student senate and a cabinet appointed by the president and vice president. Elections for academic and community senators occur each spring, along with the elections for the president and vice president. The cabinet is appointed by the president and vice president.

The Student Government is an advocate for students and is responsible for basic representation as well as improving campus for students. The Student Government endorses proposal that are brought before the University Council.

===Academic Senate===
The Academic Senate is responsible for representing faculty within the shared governance system. The Academic Senate has 43 senators.

===Staff Council===
The Staff Council represents staff in the shared governance system.

==Notable alumni==

RIT has over 125,000 alumni worldwide. Eleven RIT alumni, affiliates, and faculty members have been recipients of the Pulitzer Prize, winning a total of 15 prizes.

Notable alumni include Fredericka Douglass Sprague Perry, a philanthropist, a pioneer in the welfare of Black children, and the granddaughter of Frederick Douglass; Bob Duffy, former New York Lieutenant Governor; Tom Curley, former president and CEO of the Associated Press; Daniel Carp, former chairman of the Eastman Kodak Company; John Resig, software developer and creator of jQuery; N. Katherine Hayles, critical theorist; Austin McChord, founder and CEO of Datto; Jack Van Antwerp, former director of photography for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;; and photojournalist Bernie Boston.
==Presidents and provosts==
In the decades prior to the selection of RIT&#x27;s first president, the university was administered primarily by the board of trustees.
In addition to the ten official presidents, Provost Thomas R. Plough served as acting president twice: once, in February 1991 when M. Richard Rose was on sabbatical with the CIA, and again in 1992 between Rose&#x27;s retirement and Albert J. Simone&#x27;s installation.

<text>In Greek mythology, the name Periboea (; Ancient Greek: Περίβοια &quot;surrounded by cattle&quot; derived from &quot;peri&quot; &quot;around&quot; and &quot;boes&quot; &quot;cattle&quot;) refers to multiple figures:

*Periboea, one of the 3,000 Oceanids, water-nymph daughters of the Titans Oceanus and his sister-wife Tethys. She was the mother of Aura by Lelantos.
*Periboea, daughter of the Giant Eurymedon and the mother of Nausithous with Poseidon.
*Periboea, daughter of either King Cychreus of Salamis or of King Alcathous of Megara, her mother in the latter case being either Pyrgo or Evaechme, daughter of King Megareus of Onchestus. She was ravished by Telamon who then fled away; when her father learned of that, he ordered for her to be cast in the sea, but the guard who was to perform that took pity on her and sold her away; the one who bought her happened to be Telamon. She became by him mother of Ajax. She was among the would-be sacrificial victims of Minotaur; while on board the ship, Minos attempted to sexually abuse her but she was defended by Theseus, with whom she later consorted. Also known as Eriboea.
*Periboea, an alternate name for Merope, the wife of King Polybus of Corinth and mother of Alcinoe. She was the foster mother of Oedipus, future king of Thebes.
*Periboea, a Naiad, wife of Icarius, mother of Penelope, Perilaus, Aletes, Damasippus, Imeusimus and Thoas, presumably also of Iphthime. Icarius&#x27; wife is alternatively known as Asterodia, Dorodoche or Polycaste
*Periboea, the Olenian daughter of Hipponous and mother of Tydeus and possibly Melanippus or Olenias by Oeneus. She was sent by his father to Oeneus because she was seduced by Hippostratus, son of Amarynceus.
*Periboea, one of the first two maidens sent by the people of Locris to the shrine of Athena at Troy, in order to relieve them of plague. The other was named Cleopatra.
*Periboea, eldest daughter of Acessamenus, and mother of Pelagon by the river-god Axius.
*Periboea, mother, by Meges, of the Trojans Celtus and Eubius (Εὔβιος).
*Periboea, daughter of Aeolus, the wind lord, and Telepora or Telepatra.

<doc id="81761" wikidata="Q38423" url="?curid=81761" title="Diesel fuel">
<text>Diesel fuel, also called diesel oil, heavy oil (historically) or simply diesel, is any liquid fuel specifically designed for use in a diesel engine, a type of internal combustion engine in which fuel ignition takes place without a spark as a result of compression of the inlet air and then injection of fuel. Therefore, diesel fuel needs good compression ignition characteristics.

The most common type of diesel fuel is a specific fractional distillate of petroleum fuel oil, but alternatives that are not derived from petroleum, such as biodiesel, biomass to liquid (BTL) or gas to liquid (GTL) diesel are increasingly being developed and adopted. To distinguish these types, petroleum-derived diesel is sometimes called petrodiesel in some academic circles. Diesel is a high-volume product of oil refineries.

In many countries, diesel fuel is standardized. For example, in the European Union, the standard for diesel fuel is EN 590. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) is a diesel fuel with substantially lowered sulfur contents. As of 2016, almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe, and North America is of a ULSD type. Before diesel fuel had been standardized, the majority of diesel engines typically ran on cheap fuel oils. These fuel oils are still used in watercraft diesel engines. Despite being specifically designed for diesel engines, diesel fuel can also be used as fuel for several non-diesel engines, for example the Akroyd engine, the Stirling engine, or boilers for steam engines. Diesel is often used in heavy trucks. However, diesel exhaust, especially from older engines, can cause health damage.

== Names ==
Diesel fuel has many colloquial names; most commonly, it is simply referred to as &quot;diesel&quot;. In the United Kingdom, diesel fuel for road use is commonly called &quot;diesel&quot; or sometimes &quot;white diesel&quot; if required to differentiate it from a reduced-tax agricultural-only product containing an identifying coloured dye known as &quot;red diesel&quot;. The official term for white diesel is &quot;DERV&quot;, standing for &quot;diesel-engine road vehicle&quot;. In Australia, diesel fuel is also known as distillate (not to be confused with &quot;distillate&quot; in an older sense referring to a different motor fuel), and in Indonesia (as well in Israel), it is known as Solar, a trademarked name from the country&#x27;s national petroleum company Pertamina. The term gas oil (French: &quot;gazole&quot;) is sometimes also used to refer to diesel fuel.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Diesel fuel originated from experiments conducted by German scientist and inventor Rudolf Diesel for his compression-ignition engine which he invented around 1892. Originally, Diesel did not consider using any specific type of fuel. Instead, he claimed that the operating principle of his rational heat motor would work with any kind of fuel in any state of matter. The first diesel engine prototype and the first functional Diesel engine were only designed for liquid fuels.

At first, Diesel tested crude oil from Pechelbronn, but soon replaced it with petrol and kerosene, because crude oil proved to be too viscous, with the main testing fuel for the Diesel engine being kerosene (paraffin). Diesel experimented with types of lamp oil from various sources, as well as types of petrol and ligroin, which all worked well as Diesel engine fuels. Later, Diesel tested coal tar creosote, paraffin oil, crude oil, gasoline and fuel oil, which eventually worked as well. In Scotland and France, shale oil was used as fuel for the first 1898 production Diesel engines because other fuels were too expensive. In 1900, the French Otto society built a Diesel engine for the use with crude oil, which was exhibited at the 1900 Paris Exposition and the 1911 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris. The engine actually ran on peanut oil instead of crude oil, and no modifications were necessary for peanut oil operation.

During his first Diesel engine tests, Diesel also used illuminating gas as fuel, and managed to build functional designs, both with and without pilot injection. According to Diesel, neither was a coal-dust–producing industry existent, nor was fine, high-quality coal-dust commercially available in the late 1890s. This is the reason why the Diesel engine was never designed or planned as a coal-dust engine. Only in December 1899, did Diesel test a coal-dust prototype, which used external mixture formation and liquid fuel pilot injection. This engine proved to be functional, but suffered from piston ring failure after a few minutes due to coal dust deposition.

=== Since the 20th century ===

Before diesel fuel was standardised, diesel engines typically ran on cheap fuel oils. In the United States, these were distilled from petroleum, whereas in Europe, coal-tar creosote oil was used. Some diesel engines were fuelled with mixtures of fuels, such as petrol, kerosene, rapeseed oil, or lubricating oil which were cheaper because, at the time, they were not being taxed. The introduction of motor-vehicle diesel engines, such as the Mercedes-Benz OM 138, in the 1930s meant that higher-quality fuels with proper ignition characteristics were needed. At first no improvements were made to motor-vehicle diesel fuel quality. After World War II, the first modern high-quality diesel fuels were standardised. These standards were, for instance, the DIN 51601, VTL 9140–001, and NATO F 54 standards. In 1993, the DIN 51601 was rendered obsolete by the new EN 590 standard, which has been used in the European Union ever since. In sea-going watercraft, where diesel propulsion had gained prevalence by the late 1970s due to increasing fuel costs caused by the 1970s energy crisis, cheap heavy fuel oils are still used instead of conventional motor-vehicle diesel fuel. These heavy fuel oils (often called Bunker C) can be used in diesel-powered and steam-powered vessels.

== Types ==
Diesel fuel is produced from various sources, the most common being petroleum. Other sources include biomass, animal fat, biogas, natural gas, and coal liquefaction.

Petroleum diesel is the most common type of diesel fuel. It is produced by the fractional distillation of crude oil between at atmospheric pressure, resulting in a mixture of carbon chains that typically contain between 9 and 25 carbon atoms per molecule. This fraction is subjected to hydrodesulfurization.

Usually such &quot;straight-run&quot; diesel is insufficient in supply and quality, so other sources of diesel fuels are blended in. One major source of additional diesel fuel is obtained by cracking heavier fractions, using visbreaking and coking. This technology converts less useful fractions but the product contains olefins (alkenes) which require hydrogenation to give the saturated hydrocarbons as desired. Another refinery stream that contributes to diesel fuel is hydrocracking. Finally, kerosene is added to modify its viscosity.

=== Synthetic diesel ===

Synthetic diesel can be produced from many carbonaceous precursors but natural gas is most important. Raw materials are converted to synthesis gas which by the Fischer–Tropsch process is converted to a synthetic diesel. Synthetic diesel produced in this way generally is mainly paraffins with low sulfur and aromatics content. This material is blended often into the above mentions petroleum derived diesel.

=== Biodiesel ===

Biodiesel is obtained from vegetable oil or animal fats (biolipids) which are mainly fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), and transesterified with methanol. It can be produced from many types of oils, the most common being rapeseed oil (rapeseed methyl ester, RME) in Europe and soybean oil (soy methyl ester, SME) in the US. Methanol can also be replaced with ethanol for the transesterification process, which results in the production of ethyl esters. The transesterification processes use catalysts, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, to convert vegetable oil and methanol into biodiesel and the undesirable byproducts glycerine and water, which will need to be removed from the fuel along with methanol traces. Biodiesel can be used pure (B100) in engines where the manufacturer approves such use, but it is more often used as a mix with diesel, BXX where XX is the biodiesel content in percent.

FAME used as fuel is specified in DIN EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards.
== Storage and additives==

In the US, diesel is recommended to be stored in a yellow container to differentiate it from kerosene, which is typically kept in blue containers, and gasoline (petrol), which is typically kept in red containers. In the UK, diesel is normally stored in a black container to differentiate it from unleaded or leaded petrol, which are stored in green and red containers, respectively.

Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) is added to diesel as a &quot;cold flow improver&quot;. 50-500 ppm of EVA inhibits crystallization of waxes, which can block fuel filters. Antifoaming agents (silicones), antioxidants (hindered phenols), and &quot;metal deactivating agents&quot; (salicylaldimines) are other additives. Their use is dictated by the particular composition of and storage plans for diesel fuels. Each is added at the 5-50 ppm level.

== Standards ==

The diesel engine is a multifuel engine and can run on a huge variety of fuels. However, development of high-performance, high-speed diesel engines for cars and lorries in the 1930s meant that a proper fuel specifically designed for such engines was needed: diesel fuel. In order to ensure consistent quality, diesel fuel is standardised; the first standards were introduced after World War II. Typically, a standard defines certain properties of the fuel, such as cetane number, density, flash point, sulphur content, or biodiesel content. Diesel fuel standards include:

Diesel fuel
* EN 590 (European Union)
* ASTM D975 (United States)
* GOST R 52368 (Russia; equivalent to EN 590)
* NATO F 54 (NATO; equivalent to EN 590)
* DIN 51601 (West Germany; obsolete)

Biodiesel fuel
* EN 14214 (European Union)
* ASTM D6751 (United States)
* CAN/CGSB-3.524 (Canada)

== Measurements and pricing ==

=== Cetane number ===

The principal measure of diesel fuel quality is its cetane number. A cetane number is a measure of the delay of ignition of a diesel fuel. A higher cetane number indicates that the fuel ignites more readily when sprayed into hot compressed air. European (EN 590 standard) road diesel has a minimum cetane number of 51. Fuels with higher cetane numbers, normally &quot;premium&quot; diesel fuels with additional cleaning agents and some synthetic content, are available in some markets.

=== Fuel value and price ===
About 86.1% of diesel fuel mass is carbon, and when burned, it offers a net heating value of 43.1 MJ/kg as opposed to 43.2 MJ/kg for gasoline. Due to the higher density, diesel fuel offers a higher volumetric energy density: the density of EN 590 diesel fuel is defined as at , about 9.0-13.9% more than EN 228 gasoline (petrol)&#x27;s at 15 °C, which should be put into consideration when comparing volumetric fuel prices. The emissions from diesel are 73.25 g/MJ, just slightly lower than for gasoline at 73.38 g/MJ.

Diesel fuel is generally simpler to refine from petroleum than gasoline. Additional refining is required to remove sulfur, which contributes to a sometimes higher cost. In many parts of the United States and throughout the United Kingdom and Australia, diesel fuel may be priced higher than petrol per gallon or liter. Reasons for higher-priced diesel include the shutdown of some refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, diversion of mass refining capacity to gasoline production, and a recent transfer to ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD), which causes infrastructural complications. In Sweden, a diesel fuel designated as MK-1 (class 1 environmental diesel) is also being sold. This is a ULSD that also has a lower aromatics content, with a limit of 5%. This fuel is slightly more expensive to produce than regular ULSD. In Germany, the fuel tax on diesel fuel is about 28% lower than the petrol fuel tax.

=== Taxation ===
Diesel fuel is similar to heating oil, which is used in central heating. In Europe, the United States, and Canada, taxes on diesel fuel are higher than on heating oil due to the fuel tax, and in those areas, heating oil is marked with fuel dyes and trace chemicals to prevent and detect tax fraud. &quot;Untaxed&quot; diesel (sometimes called &quot;off-road diesel&quot; or &quot;red diesel&quot; due to its red dye) is available in some countries for use primarily in agricultural applications, such as fuel for tractors, recreational and utility vehicles or other noncommercial vehicles that do not use public roads. This fuel may have sulfur levels that exceed the limits for road use in some countries (e.g. US).

This untaxed diesel is dyed red for identification, and using this untaxed diesel fuel for a typically taxed purpose (such as driving use), the user can be fined (e.g. US$10,000 in the US). In the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands, it is known as red diesel (or gas oil), and is also used in agricultural vehicles, home heating tanks, refrigeration units on vans/trucks which contain perishable items such as food and medicine and for marine craft. Diesel fuel, or marked gas oil is dyed green in the Republic of Ireland and Norway. The term &quot;diesel-engined road vehicle&quot; (DERV) is used in the UK as a synonym for unmarked road diesel fuel. In India, taxes on diesel fuel are lower than on petrol, as the majority of the transportation for grain and other essential commodities across the country runs on diesel.

Taxes on biodiesel in the US vary between states. Some states (Texas, for example) have no tax on biodiesel and a reduced tax on biodiesel blends equivalent to the amount of biodiesel in the blend, so that B20 fuel is taxed 20% less than pure petrodiesel. Other states, such as North Carolina, tax biodiesel (in any blended configuration) the same as petrodiesel, although they have introduced new incentives to producers and users of all biofuels.

== Uses ==

Diesel fuel is mostly used in high-speed diesel engines, especially motor-vehicle (e.g. car, lorry) diesel engines, but not all diesel engines run on diesel fuel. For example, large two-stroke watercraft engines typically use heavy fuel oils instead of diesel fuel, and certain types of diesel engines, such as MAN M-System engines, are designed to run on petrol with knock resistances of up to 86 RON. On the other hand, gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines, and external combustion engines, can also be designed to take diesel fuel.

The viscosity requirement of diesel fuel is usually specified at 40 °C. A disadvantage of diesel fuel in cold climates is that its viscosity increases as the temperature decreases, changing it into a gel (see Compression Ignition – Gelling) that cannot flow in fuel systems. Special low-temperature diesel contains additives to keep it liquid at lower temperatures.

=== On-road vehicles ===

Trucks and buses, which were often otto-powered in the 1920s through 1950s, are now almost exclusively diesel-powered. Due to its ignition characteristics, diesel fuel is thus widely used in these vehicles. Since diesel fuel is not well-suited for otto engines, passenger cars, which often use otto or otto-derived engines, typically run on petrol instead of diesel fuel. However, especially in Europe and India, many passenger cars have, due to better engine efficiency, diesel engines, and thus run on regular diesel fuel.

=== Railroad ===

Diesel displaced coal and fuel oil for steam-powered vehicles in the latter half of the 20th century, and is now used almost exclusively for the combustion engines of self-powered rail vehicles (locomotives and railcars).

=== Aircraft ===
In general, diesel engines are not well-suited for planes and helicopters. This is because of the diesel engine&#x27;s comparatively low power-to-mass ratio, meaning that diesel engines are typically rather heavy, which is a disadvantage in aircraft. Therefore, there is little need for using diesel fuel in aircraft, and diesel fuel is not commercially used as aviation fuel. Instead, petrol (Avgas), and jet fuel (e. g. Jet A-1) are used. However, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, numerous series-production aircraft diesel engines that ran on fuel oils were made, because they had several advantages: their fuel consumption was low, they were reliable, not prone to catching fire, and required minimal maintenance. The introduction of petrol direct injection in the 1930s outweighed these advantages, and aircraft diesel engines quickly fell out of use. With improvements in power-to-mass ratios of diesel engines, several on-road diesel engines have been converted to and certified for aircraft use since the early 21st century. These engines typically run on Jet A-1 aircraft fuel (but can also run on diesel fuel). Jet A-1 has ignition characteristics similar to diesel fuel, and is thus suited for certain (but not all) diesel engines.

=== Military vehicles ===

Until World War II, several military vehicles, especially those that required high engine performance (armored fighting vehicles, for example the M26 Pershing or Panther tanks), used conventional otto engines and ran on petrol. Ever since World War II, several military vehicles with diesel engines have been made, capable of running on diesel fuel. This is because diesel engines are more fuel efficient, and diesel fuel is less prone to catching fire. Some of these diesel-powered vehicles (such as the Leopard 1 or MAN 630) still ran on petrol, and some military vehicles were still made with otto engines (e. g. Ural-375 or Unimog 404), incapable of running on diesel fuel.

=== Tractors and heavy equipment ===

Today&#x27;s tractors and heavy equipment are mostly diesel-powered. Among tractors, only the smaller classes may also offer gasoline-fuelled engines. The dieselization of tractors and heavy equipment began in Germany before World War II but was unusual in the United States until after that war. During the 1950s and 1960s, it progressed in the US as well. Diesel fuel is commonly used in oil and gas extracting equipment, although some locales use electric or natural gas powered equipment.

Tractors and heavy equipment were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s, running either spark-ignition and low-compression engines, akryod engines, or diesel engines. Thus many farm tractors of the era could burn gasoline, alcohol, kerosene, and any light grade of fuel oil such as heating oil, or tractor vaporising oil, according to whichever was most affordable in a region at any given time. On US farms during this era, the name &quot;distillate&quot; often referred to any of the aforementioned light fuel oils. Spark ignition engines did not start as well on distillate, so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting, and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later, after warm-up, to transition to distillate. Engine accessories such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used, both with the aim of capturing heat, because when such an engine was run on distillate, it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature. Dieselization with dedicated diesel engines (high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition) replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned.

=== Other uses ===
Poor quality diesel fuel has been used as an extraction agent for liquid–liquid extraction of palladium from nitric acid mixtures. Such use has been proposed as a means of separating the fission product palladium from PUREX raffinate which comes from used nuclear fuel. In this system of solvent extraction, the hydrocarbons of the diesel act as the diluent while the dialkyl sulfides act as the extractant. This extraction operates by a solvation mechanism. So far, neither a pilot plant nor full scale plant has been constructed to recover palladium, rhodium or ruthenium from nuclear wastes created by the use of nuclear fuel.

Diesel fuel is often used as the main ingredient in oil-base mud drilling fluid. The advantage of using diesel is its low cost and its ability to drill a wide variety of difficult strata, including shale, salt and gypsum formations. Diesel-oil mud is typically mixed with up to 40% brine water. Due to health, safety and environmental concerns, Diesel-oil mud is often replaced with vegetable, mineral, or synthetic food-grade oil-base drilling fluids, although diesel-oil mud is still in widespread use in certain regions.

During development of rocket engines in Germany during World War II J-2 Diesel fuel was used as the fuel component in several engines including the BMW 109-718. J-2 diesel fuel was also used as a fuel for gas turbine engines.

== Chemical analysis ==

=== Chemical composition ===

In the United States, petroleum-derived diesel is composed of about 75% saturated hydrocarbons (primarily paraffins including &quot;n&quot;, &quot;iso&quot;, and cycloparaffins), and 25% aromatic hydrocarbons (including naphthalenes and alkylbenzenes). The average chemical formula for common diesel fuel is C12H23, ranging approximately from C10H20 to C15H28.

=== Chemical properties ===

Most diesel fuels freeze at common winter temperatures, while the temperatures greatly vary. Petrodiesel typically freezes around temperatures of , whereas biodiesel freezes between temperatures of . The viscosity of diesel noticeably increases as the temperature decreases, changing it into a gel at temperatures of , that cannot flow in fuel systems. Conventional diesel fuels vaporise at temperatures between 149 °C and 371 °C.

Conventional diesel flash points vary between 52 and 96 °C, which makes it safer than petrol and unsuitable for spark-ignition engines. Unlike petrol, the flash point of a diesel fuel has no relation to its performance in an engine nor to its auto ignition qualities.

== Carbon dioxide formation ==
As a good approximation the chemical formula of diesel is . Diesel is a mixture of different molecules. As carbon has a molar mass of 12 g/mol and hydrogen has a molar mass of about 1 g/mol, so the fraction by weight of carbon in EN 590 diesel fuel is roughly 12/14.

The reaction of diesel combustion is given by:

2 + 3n 2n + 2n

Carbon dioxide has a molar mass of 44g/mol as it consists of 2 atoms of oxygen (16 g/mol) and 1 atom of carbon (12 g/mol). So 12 g of carbon yield 44 g of Carbon dioxide.

Diesel has a density of 838 g per liter.

Putting everything together the mass of carbon dioxide that is produced by burning 1 liter of diesel fuel can be calculated as:

formula_1

The figure obtained with this estimation is close to the values found in the literature.

For gasoline, with a density of 0.75 kg/L and a ratio of carbon to hydrogen atoms of about 6 to 14, the estimated value of carbon emission if 1 liter of gasoline is burnt gives:

formula_2

== Hazards ==
=== Environment hazards of sulfur ===

In the past, diesel fuel contained higher quantities of sulfur. European emission standards and preferential taxation have forced oil refineries to dramatically reduce the level of sulfur in diesel fuels. In the European Union, the sulfur content has dramatically reduced during the last 20 years. Automotive diesel fuel is covered in the European Union by standard EN 590. In the 1990s specifications allowed a content of 2000 ppm max of sulfur, reduced to a limit of 350 ppm by the beginning of the 21st century with the introduction of Euro 3 specifications. The limit was lowered with the introduction of Euro 4 by 2006 to 50 ppm (ULSD, Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel). The standard for diesel fuel in force in Europe as of 2009 is the Euro 5, with a maximum content of 10 ppm.

In the United States, more stringent emission standards have been adopted with the transition to ULSD starting in 2006, and becoming mandatory on June 1, 2010 (see also diesel exhaust).

=== Algae, microbes, and water contamination ===

There has been much discussion and misunderstanding of algae in diesel fuel. Algae need light to live and grow. As there is no sunlight in a closed fuel tank, no algae can survive, but some microbes can survive and feed on the diesel fuel.

These microbes form a colony that lives at the interface of fuel and water. They grow quite fast in warmer temperatures. They can even grow in cold weather when fuel tank heaters are installed. Parts of the colony can break off and clog the fuel lines and fuel filters.

Water in fuel can damage a fuel injection pump. Some diesel fuel filters also trap water. Water contamination in diesel fuel can lead to freezing while in the fuel tank. The freezing water that saturates the fuel will sometimes clog the fuel injector pump. Once the water inside the fuel tank has started to freeze, gelling is more likely to occur. When the fuel is gelled it is not effective until the temperature is raised and the fuel returns to a liquid state.

=== Road hazard ===
Diesel is less flammable than gasoline / petrol. However, because it evaporates slowly, any spills on a roadway can pose a slip hazard to vehicles. After the light fractions have evaporated, a greasy slick is left on the road which reduces tire grip and traction, and can cause vehicles to skid. The loss of traction is similar to that encountered on black ice, resulting in especially dangerous situations for two-wheeled vehicles, such as motorcycles and bicycles, in roundabouts.

<doc id="81763" wikidata="Q577552" url="?curid=81763" title="Antilochus (son of Nestor)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Antilochus (; Ancient Greek: Ἀντίλοχος &quot;Antílokhos&quot;) was a prince of Pylos and one of the Achaeans in the Trojan War.

== Family ==
Antilochus was the son of King Nestor either by Anaxibia or Eurydice. He was the brother to Thrasymedes, Pisidice, Polycaste, Perseus, Stratichus, Aretus, Echephron and Pisistratus.

== Mythology ==
One of the suitors of Helen, Antilochus accompanied his father Nestor and his brother Thrasymedes to the Trojan War. When fighting there resumed after the aborted duel of Paris and Menelaus, Antilochus was first to kill a Trojan (namely Echepolus). Antilochus was distinguished for his beauty, swiftness of foot, and skill as a charioteer. Though the youngest among the Greek princes, he commanded the Pylians in the war and performed many deeds of valour. He was a favorite of the gods and a friend of Achilles, to whom he was commissioned to announce the death of Patroclus.

When his father Nestor was attacked by Memnon, Antilochus sacrificed himself to save him, thus fulfilling an oracle which had warned to &quot;beware of an Ethiopian.&quot; Antilochus&#x27; death was avenged by Achilles, who drove the Trojans back to the gates, where he is killed by Paris. In later accounts, Antilochus was slain by Hector or by Paris in the temple of the Thymbraean Apollo together with Achilles His ashes, along with those of Achilles and Patroclus, were enshrined in a mound on the promontory of Sigeion, where the inhabitants of Ilium offered sacrifice to the dead heroes. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the three friends are represented as united in the underworld and walking together in the Asphodel Meadows. However, according to Pausanias, they dwell together on the island of Leuke.

Among the Trojans he killed were Melanippus, Ablerus, Atymnius, Phalces, Echepolos, and Thoon, although Hyginus records that he only killed two Trojans. At the funeral games of Patroclus, Antilochus finished second in the chariot race and third in the foot race.

Antilochus left behind in Messenia a son Paeon, whose descendants were among the Neleidae expelled from Messenia, by the descendants of Heracles.

<doc id="81768" wikidata="Q180237" url="?curid=81768" title="Typhon">
<text>Typhon (; , ), also Typhoeus (; ), Typhaon () or Typhos (), was a monstrous serpentine giant and one of the deadliest creatures in Greek mythology. According to Hesiod, Typhon was the son of Gaia and Tartarus. However, one source has Typhon as the son of Hera alone, while another makes Typhon the offspring of Cronus. Typhon and his mate Echidna were the progenitors of many famous monsters.

Typhon attempted to overthrow Zeus for the supremacy of the cosmos. The two fought a cataclysmic battle, which Zeus finally won with the aid of his thunderbolts. Defeated, Typhon was cast into Tartarus, or buried underneath Mount Etna, or in later accounts, the island of Ischia.

Typhon mythology is part of the Greek succession myth, which explained how Zeus came to rule the gods. Typhon&#x27;s story is also connected with that of Python (the serpent killed by Apollo), and both stories probably derived from several Near Eastern antecedents. Typhon was (from ) also identified with the Egyptian god of destruction Set. In later accounts, Typhon was often confused with the Giants.

==Mythology==
===Birth===
According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; ( – 7th century BC), Typhon was the son of Gaia (Earth) and Tartarus: &quot;when Zeus had driven the Titans from heaven, huge Earth bore her youngest child Typhoeus of the love of Tartarus, by the aid of golden Aphrodite&quot;. The mythographer Apollodorus (1st or 2nd century AD) adds that Gaia bore Typhon in anger at the gods for their destruction of her offspring the Giants.

Numerous other sources mention Typhon as being the offspring of Gaia, or simply &quot;earth-born&quot;, with no mention of Tartarus. However, according to the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot; (6th century BC), Typhon was the child of Hera alone. Hera, angry at Zeus for having given birth to Athena by himself, prayed to Gaia, Uranus, and the Titans, to give her a son stronger than Zeus, then slapped the ground and became pregnant. Hera gave the infant Typhon to the serpent Python to raise, and Typhon grew up to become a great bane to mortals.

Several sources locate Typhon&#x27;s birth and dwelling place in Cilicia, and in particular the region in the vicinity of the ancient Cilician coastal city of Corycus (modern Kızkalesi, Turkey). The poet Pindar () calls Typhon &quot;Cilician&quot;, and says that Typhon was born in Cilicia and nurtured in &quot;the famous Cilician cave&quot;, an apparent allusion to the Corycian cave in Turkey. In Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, Typhon is called the &quot;dweller of the Cilician caves&quot;, and both Apollodorus and the poet Nonnus (4th or 5th century AD) have Typhon born in Cilicia.

The b scholia to &quot;Iliad&quot; 2.783, preserving a possibly Orphic tradition, has Typhon born in Cilicia, as the offspring of Cronus. Gaia, angry at the destruction of the Giants, slanders Zeus to Hera. So Hera goes to Cronus, her and Zeus&#x27; father (whom Zeus had overthrown), and Cronus gives Hera two eggs smeared with his own semen, telling her to bury them underground, and that from them would be born one who would overthrow Zeus. Hera, angry at Zeus, buries the eggs in Cilicia &quot;under Arimon&quot;, but when Typhon is born, Hera, now reconciled with Zeus, informs him.

===Descriptions===
According to Hesiod, Typhon was &quot;terrible, outrageous and lawless&quot;, immensely powerful, and on his shoulders were one hundred snake heads, that emitted fire and every kind of noise:
Strength was with his hands in all that he did and the feet of the strong god were untiring. From his shoulders grew a hundred heads of a snake, a fearful dragon, with dark, flickering tongues, and from under the brows of his eyes in his marvelous heads flashed fire, and fire burned from his heads as he glared. And there were voices in all his dreadful heads which uttered every kind of sound unspeakable; for at one time they made sounds such that the gods understood, but at another, the noise of a bull bellowing aloud in proud ungovernable fury; and at another, the sound of a lion, relentless of heart; and at another, sounds like whelps, wonderful to hear; and again, at another, he would hiss, so that the high mountains re-echoed.

The &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot; describes Typhon as &quot;fell&quot; and &quot;cruel&quot;, and like neither gods nor men. Three of Pindar&#x27;s poems have Typhon as hundred-headed (as in Hesiod), while apparently a fourth gives him only fifty heads, but a hundred heads for Typhon became standard. A Chalcidian hydria (–530 BC), depicts Typhon as a winged humanoid from the waist up, with two snake tails for legs below. Aeschylus calls Typhon &quot;fire-breathing&quot;. For Nicander (2nd century BC), Typhon was a monster of enormous strength, and strange appearance, with many heads, hands, and wings, and with huge snake coils coming from his thighs.

Apollodorus describes Typhon as a huge winged monster, whose head &quot;brushed the stars&quot;, human in form above the waist, with snake coils below, and fire flashing from his eyes:

In size and strength he surpassed all the offspring of Earth. As far as the thighs he was of human shape and of such prodigious bulk that he out-topped all the mountains, and his head often brushed the stars. One of his hands reached out to the west and the other to the east, and from them projected a hundred dragons&#x27; heads. From the thighs downward he had huge coils of vipers, which when drawn out, reached to his very head and emitted a loud hissing. His body was all winged: unkempt hair streamed on the wind from his head and cheeks; and fire flashed from his eyes.

The most elaborate description of Typhon is found in Nonnus&#x27;s &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;. Nonnus makes numerous references to Typhon&#x27;s serpentine nature, giving him a &quot;tangled army of snakes&quot;, snaky feet, and hair. According to Nonnus, Typhon was a &quot;poison-spitting viper&quot;, whose &quot;every hair belched viper-poison&quot;, and Typhon &quot;spat out showers of poison from his throat; the mountain torrents were swollen, as the monster showered fountains from the viperish bristles of his high head&quot;, and &quot;the water-snakes of the monster&#x27;s viperish feet crawl into the caverns underground, spitting poison!&quot;.

Following Hesiod and others, Nonnus gives Typhon many heads (though untotaled), but in addition to snake heads, Nonnus also gives Typhon many other animal heads, including leopards, lions, bulls, boars, bears, cattle, wolves, and dogs, which combine to make &#x27;the cries of all wild beasts together&#x27;, and a &quot;babel of screaming sounds&quot;. Nonnus also gives Typhon &quot;legions of arms innumerable&quot;, and where Nicander had only said that Typhon had &quot;many&quot; hands, and Ovid had given Typhon a hundred hands, Nonnus gives Typhon two hundred.

===Offspring===
According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Typhon &quot;was joined in love&quot; to Echidna, a monstrous half-woman and half-snake, who bore Typhon &quot;fierce offspring&quot;. First, according to Hesiod, there was Orthrus, the two-headed dog who guarded the Cattle of Geryon, second Cerberus, the multiheaded dog who guarded the gates of Hades, and third the Lernaean Hydra, the many-headed serpent who, when one of its heads was cut off, grew two more. The &quot;Theogony&quot; next mentions an ambiguous &quot;she&quot;, which might refer to Echidna, as the mother of the Chimera (a fire-breathing beast that was part lion, part goat, and had a snake-headed tail) with Typhon then being the father.

While mentioning Cerberus and &quot;other monsters&quot; as being the offspring of Echidna and Typhon, the mythographer Acusilaus (6th century BC) adds the Caucasian Eagle that ate the liver of Prometheus. The mythographer Pherecydes of Athens (5th century BC) also names Prometheus&#x27;s eagle, and adds Ladon (though Pherecydes does not use this name), the dragon that guarded the golden apples in the Garden of the Hesperides (according to Hesiod, the offspring of Ceto and Phorcys). The lyric poet Lasus of Hermione (6th century BC) adds the Sphinx.

Later authors mostly retain these offspring of Typhon by Echidna, while adding others. Apollodorus, in addition to naming as their offspring Orthrus, the Chimera (citing Hesiod as his source) the Caucasian Eagle, Ladon, and the Sphinx, also adds the Nemean lion (no mother is given), and the Crommyonian Sow, killed by the hero Theseus (unmentioned by Hesiod).

Hyginus (1st century BC), in his list of offspring of Typhon (all by Echidna), retains from the above: Cerberus, the Chimera, the Sphinx, the Hydra and Ladon, and adds &quot;Gorgon&quot; (by which Hyginus means the mother of Medusa, whereas Hesiod&#x27;s three Gorgons, of which Medusa was one, were the daughters of Ceto and Phorcys), the Colchian dragon that guarded the Golden Fleece and Scylla. The Harpies, in Hesiod the daughters of Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra, in one source, are said to be the daughters of Typhon.

The sea serpents which attacked the Trojan priest Laocoön, during the Trojan War, were perhaps supposed to be the progeny of Typhon and Echidna. According to Hesiod, the defeated Typhon is the father of destructive storm winds.

===Battle with Zeus===
Typhon challenged Zeus for rule of the cosmos. The earliest mention of Typhon, and his only occurrence in Homer, is a passing reference in the &quot;Iliad&quot; to Zeus striking the ground around where Typhon lies defeated. Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; gives the first account of their battle. According to Hesiod, without the quick action of Zeus, Typhon would have &quot;come to reign over mortals and immortals&quot;. In the &quot;Theogony&quot; Zeus and Typhon meet in cataclysmic conflict:

[Zeus] thundered hard and mightily: and the earth around resounded terribly and the wide heaven above, and the sea and Ocean&#x27;s streams and the nether parts of the earth. Great Olympus reeled beneath the divine feet of the king as he arose and earth groaned thereat. And through the two of them heat took hold on the dark-blue sea, through the thunder and lightning, and through the fire from the monster, and the scorching winds and blazing thunderbolt. The whole earth seethed, and sky and sea: and the long waves raged along the beaches round and about at the rush of the deathless gods: and there arose an endless shaking. Hades trembled where he rules over the dead below, and the Titans under Tartarus who live with Cronos, because of the unending clamor and the fearful strife.

Zeus with his thunderbolt easily overcomes Typhon, who is thrown down to earth in a fiery crash:

So when Zeus had raised up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and lurid thunderbolt, he leaped from Olympus and struck him, and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him. But when Zeus had conquered him and lashed him with strokes, Typhoeus was hurled down, a maimed wreck, so that the huge earth groaned. And flame shot forth from the thunderstricken lord in the dim rugged glens of the mount, when he was smitten. A great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapor and melted as tin melts when heated by men&#x27;s art in channelled crucibles; or as iron, which is hardest of all things, is shortened by glowing fire in mountain glens and melts in the divine earth through the strength of Hephaestus. Even so, then, the earth melted in the glow of the blazing fire.

Defeated, Typhon is cast into Tartarus by an angry Zeus.

Epimenides (7th or 6th century BC) seemingly knew a different version of the story, in which Typhon enters Zeus&#x27; palace while Zeus is asleep, but Zeus awakes and kills Typhon with a thunderbolt. Pindar apparently knew of a tradition which had the gods, in order to escape from Typhon, transform themselves into animals, and flee to Egypt. Pindar calls Typhon the &quot;enemy of the gods&quot;, and says that he was defeated by Zeus&#x27; thunderbolt. In one poem Pindar has Typhon being held prisoner by Zeus under Etna, and in another says that Typhon &quot;lies in dread Tartarus&quot;, stretched out underground between Mount Etna and Cumae. In Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, a &quot;hissing&quot; Typhon, his eyes flashing, &quot;withstood all the gods&quot;, but &quot;the unsleeping bolt of Zeus&quot; struck him, and &quot;he was burnt to ashes and his strength blasted from him by the lightning bolt. And now, a helpless and a sprawling bulk, he lies hard by the narrows of the sea, pressed down beneath the roots of Aetna; while on the topmost summit Hephaestus sits and hammers the molten ore. There, one day, shall burst forth [370] rivers of fire,1with savage jaws devouring the level fields of Sicily, land of fair fruit—such boiling rage shall Typho, although charred by the blazing lightning of Zeus, send spouting forth with hot jets of appalling, fire-breathing surge.&quot;

According to Pherecydes of Athens, during his battle with Zeus, Typhon first flees to the Caucasus, which begins to burn, then to the volcanic island of Pithecussae (modern Ischia), off the coast of Cumae, where he is buried under the island. Apollonius of Rhodes (3rd century BC), like Pherecydes, presents a multi-stage battle, with Typhon being struck by Zeus&#x27; thunderbolt on mount Caucasus, before fleeing to the mountains and plain of Nysa, and ending up (as already mentioned by the fifth-century BC Greek historian Herodotus) buried under Lake Serbonis in Egypt.

Like Pindar, Nicander has all the gods, but Zeus and Athena, transform into animal forms and flee to Egypt: Apollo became a hawk, Hermes an ibis, Ares a fish, Artemis a cat, Dionysus a goat, Heracles a fawn, Hephaestus an ox, and Leto a mouse.

The geographer Strabo (c. 20 AD) gives several locations which were associated with the battle. According to Strabo, Typhon was said to have cut the serpentine channel of the Orontes River, which flowed beneath the Syrian Mount Kasios (modern Jebel Aqra), while fleeing from Zeus, and some placed the battle at Catacecaumene (&quot;Burnt Land&quot;), a volcanic plain, on the upper Gediz River, between the ancient kingdoms of Lydia, Mysia and Phrygia, near Mount Tmolus (modern Bozdağ) and Sardis the ancient capital of Lydia.

In the versions of the battle given by Hesiod, Aeschylus and Pindar, Zeus&#x27; defeat of Typhon is straightforward; however, a more involved version of the battle is given by Apollodorus. No early source gives any reason for the conflict, but Apollodorus&#x27;s account seemingly implies that Typhon had been produced by Gaia to avenge the destruction, by Zeus and the other gods, of the Giants, a previous generation of offspring of Gaia. According to Apollodorus, Typhon, &quot;hurling kindled rocks&quot;, attacked the gods, &quot;with hissings and shouts, spouting a great jet of fire from his mouth.&quot; Seeing this, the gods transformed into animals and fled to Egypt (as in Pindar and Nicander). However &quot;Zeus pelted Typhon at a distance with thunderbolts, and at close quarters struck him down with an adamantine sickle&quot;. Wounded, Typhon fled to the Syrian Mount Kasios, where Zeus &quot;grappled&quot; with him. But Typhon, twining his snaky coils around Zeus, was able to wrest away the sickle and cut the sinews from Zeus&#x27; hands and feet. Typhon carried the disabled Zeus across the sea to the Corycian cave in Cilicia where he set the she-serpent Delphyne to guard over Zeus and his severed sinews, which Typhon had hidden in a bearskin. But Hermes and Aegipan (possibly another name for Pan) stole the sinews and gave them back to Zeus. His strength restored, Zeus chased Typhon to mount Nysa, where the Moirai tricked Typhon into eating &quot;ephemeral fruits&quot; which weakened him. Typhon then fled to Thrace, where he threw mountains at Zeus, which were turned back on him by Zeus&#x27; thunderbolts, and the mountain where Typhon stood, being drenched with Typhon&#x27;s blood, became known as Mount Haemus (Bloody Mountain). Typhon then fled to Sicily, where Zeus threw Mount Etna on top of Typhon burying him, and so finally defeated him.

Oppian (2nd century AD) says that Pan helped Zeus in the battle by tricking Typhon to come out from his lair, and into the open, by the &quot;promise of a banquet of fish&quot;, thus enabling Zeus to defeat Typhon with his thunderbolts.

====Nonnus&#x27;s &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;====
The longest and most involved version of the battle appears in Nonnus&#x27;s &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; (late 4th or early 5th century AD). Zeus hides his thunderbolts in a cave, so that he might seduce the maiden Pluto, and so produce Tantalus. But smoke rising from the thunderbolts, enables Typhon, under the guidance of Gaia, to locate Zeus&#x27;s weapons, steal them, and hide them in another cave. Immediately Typhon extends &quot;his clambering hands into the upper air&quot; and begins a long and concerted attack upon the heavens. Then &quot;leaving the air&quot; he turns his attack upon the seas. Finally Typhon attempts to wield Zeus&#x27; thunderbolts, but they &quot;felt the hands of a novice, and all their manly blaze was unmanned.&quot;

Now Zeus&#x27; sinews had somehow – Nonnus does not say how or when — fallen to the ground during their battle, and Typhon had taken them also. But Zeus devises a plan with Cadmus and Pan to beguile Typhon. Cadmus, disguised as a shepherd, enchants Typhon by playing the panpipes, and Typhon entrusting the thunderbolts to Gaia, sets out to find the source of the music he hears. Finding Cadmus, he challenges him to a contest, offering Cadmus any goddess as wife, excepting Hera whom Typhon has reserved for himself. Cadmus then tells Typhon that, if he liked the &quot;little tune&quot; of his pipes, then he would love the music of his lyre – if only it could be strung with Zeus&#x27; sinews. So Typhon retrieves the sinews and gives them to Cadmus, who hides them in another cave, and again begins to play his bewitching pipes, so that &quot;Typhoeus yielded his whole soul to Cadmos for the melody to charm&quot;.

With Typhon distracted, Zeus takes back his thunderbolts. Cadmus stops playing, and Typhon, released from his spell, rushes back to his cave to discover the thunderbolts gone. Incensed Typhon unleashes devastation upon the world: animals are devoured, (Typhon&#x27;s many animal heads each eat animals of its own kind), rivers turned to dust, seas made dry land, and the land &quot;laid waste&quot;.

The day ends with Typhon yet unchallenged, and while the other gods &quot;moved about the cloudless Nile&quot;, Zeus waits through the night for the coming dawn. Victory &quot;reproaches&quot; Zeus, urging him to &quot;stand up as champion of your own children!&quot; Dawn comes and Typhon roars out a challenge to Zeus. And a cataclysmic battle for &quot;the sceptre and throne of Zeus&quot; is joined. Typhon piles up mountains as battlements and with his &quot;legions of arms innumerable&quot;, showers volley after volley of trees and rocks at Zeus, but all are destroyed, or blown aside, or dodged, or thrown back at Typhon. Typhon throws torrents of water at Zeus&#x27; thunderbolts to quench them, but Zeus is able to cut off some of Typhon&#x27;s hands with &quot;frozen volleys of air as by a knife&quot;, and hurling thunderbolts is able to burn more of Typhon&#x27;s &quot;endless hands&quot;, and cut off some of his &quot;countless heads&quot;. Typhon is attacked by the four winds, and &quot;frozen volleys of jagged hailstones.&quot; Gaia tries to aid her burnt and frozen son. Finally Typhon falls, and Zeus shouts out a long stream of mocking taunts, telling Typhon that he is to be buried under Sicily&#x27;s hills, with a cenotaph over him which will read &quot;This is the barrow of Typhoeus, son of Earth, who once lashed the sky with stones, and the fire of heaven burnt him up&quot;.

Most accounts have the defeated Typhon buried under either Mount Etna in Sicily, or the volcanic island of Ischia, the largest of the Phlegraean Islands off the coast of Naples, with Typhon being the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

Though Hesiod has Typhon simply cast into Tartarus by Zeus, some have read a reference to Mount Etna in Hesiod&#x27;s description of Typhon&#x27;s fall:
And flame shot forth from the thunderstricken lord in the dim rugged glens of the mount when he was smitten. A great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapor and melted as tin melts when heated by men&#x27;s art in channelled crucibles; or as iron, which is hardest of all things, is shortened by glowing fire in mountain glens and melts in the divine earth through the strength of Hephaestus. Even so, then, the earth melted in the glow of the blazing fire.

The first certain references to Typhon buried under Etna, as well as being the cause of its eruptions, occur in Pindar:

Son of Cronus, you who hold Aetna, the wind-swept weight on terrible hundred-headed Typhon, 

and:
among them is he who lies in dread Tartarus, that enemy of the gods, Typhon with his hundred heads. Once the famous Cilician cave nurtured him, but now the sea-girt cliffs above Cumae, and Sicily too, lie heavy on his shaggy chest. And the pillar of the sky holds him down, snow-covered Aetna, year-round nurse of bitter frost, from whose inmost caves belch forth the purest streams of unapproachable fire. In the daytime her rivers roll out a fiery flood of smoke, while in the darkness of night the crimson flame hurls rocks down to the deep plain of the sea with a crashing roar. That monster shoots up the most terrible jets of fire; it is a marvellous wonder to see, and a marvel even to hear about when men are present. Such a creature is bound beneath the dark and leafy heights of Aetna and beneath the plain, and his bed scratches and goads the whole length of his back stretched out against it.

Thus Pindar has Typhon in Tartarus, and buried under not just Etna, but under a vast volcanic region stretching from Sicily to Cumae (in the vicinity of modern Naples), a region which presumably also included Mount Vesuvius, as well as Ischia.

Many subsequent accounts mention either Etna or Ischia. In &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, Typhon is imprisoned underneath Etna, while above him Hephaestus &quot;hammers the molten ore&quot;, and in his rage, the &quot;charred&quot; Typhon causes &quot;rivers of fire&quot; to pour forth. Ovid has Typhon buried under all of Sicily, with his left and right hands under Pelorus and Pachynus, his feet under Lilybaeus, and his head under Etna; where he &quot;vomits flames from his ferocious mouth&quot;. And Valerius Flaccus has Typhon&#x27;s head under Etna, and all of Sicily shaken when Typhon &quot;struggles&quot;. Lycophron has both Typhon and Giants buried under the island of Ischia. Virgil, Silius Italicus and Claudian, all calling the island &quot;Inarime&quot;, have Typhon buried there. Strabo, calling Ischia &quot;Pithecussae&quot;, reports the &quot;myth&quot; that Typhon lay buried there, and that when he &quot;turns his body the flames and the waters, and sometimes even small islands containing boiling water, spout forth.&quot;

In addition to Typhon, other mythological beings were also said to be buried under Mount Etna and the cause of its volcanic activity. Most notably the Giant Enceladus was said to be entombed under Etna, the volcano&#x27;s eruptions being the breath of Enceladus, and its tremors caused by the Giant rolling over from side to side beneath the mountain. Also said to be buried under Etna were the Hundred-hander Briareus, and Asteropus who was perhaps one of the Cyclopes.

====Boeotia====

Typhon&#x27;s final resting place was apparently also said to be in Boeotia. The Hesiodic &quot;Shield of Heracles&quot; names a mountain near Thebes Typhaonium, perhaps reflecting an early tradition which also had Typhon buried under a Boeotian mountain. And some apparently claimed that Typhon was buried beneath a mountain in Boeotia, from which came exhalations of fire.

===&quot;Couch of Typhoeus&quot;===
Homer describes a place he calls the &quot;couch [or bed] of Typhoeus&quot;, which he locates in the land of the Arimoi (&quot;εἰν Ἀρίμοις&quot;), where Zeus lashes the land about Typhoeus with his thunderbolts. Presumably this is the same land where, according to Hesiod, Typhon&#x27;s mate Echidna keeps guard &quot;in Arima&quot; (&quot;εἰν Ἀρίμοισιν&quot;).

But neither Homer nor Hesiod say anything more about where these Arimoi or this Arima might be. The question of whether an historical place was meant, and its possible location, has been, since ancient times, the subject of speculation and debate.

Strabo discusses the question in some detail. Several locales, Cilicia, Syria, Lydia, and the island of Ischia, all places associated with Typhon, are given by Strabo as possible locations for Homer&#x27;s &quot;Arimoi&quot;.

Pindar has his Cilician Typhon slain by Zeus &quot;among the Arimoi&quot;, and the historian Callisthenes (4th century BC), located the Arimoi and the Arima mountains in Cilicia, near the Calycadnus river, the Corycian cave and the Sarpedon promomtory. The b scholia to &quot;Iliad&quot; 2.783, mentioned above, says Typhon was born in Cilicia &quot;under Arimon&quot;, and Nonnus mentions Typhon&#x27;s &quot;bloodstained cave of Arima&quot; in Cilicia.

Just across the Gulf of Issus from Corycus, in ancient Syria, was Mount Kasios (modern Jebel Aqra) and the Orontes River, sites associated with Typhon&#x27;s battle with Zeus, and according to Strabo, the historian Posidonius (c. 2nd century BC) identified the Arimoi with the Aramaeans of Syria.

Alternatively, according to Strabo, some placed the Arimoi at Catacecaumene, while Xanthus of Lydia (5th century BC) added that &quot;a certain Arimus&quot; ruled there. Strabo also tells us that for &quot;some&quot; Homer&#x27;s &quot;couch of Typhon&quot; was located &quot;in a wooded place, in the fertile land of Hyde&quot;, with Hyde being another name for Sardis (or its acropolis), and that Demetrius of Scepsis (2nd century BC) thought that the Arimoi were most plausibly located &quot;in the Catacecaumene country in Mysia&quot;. The 3rd-century BC poet Lycophron placed the lair of Typhon&#x27;s mate Echidna in this region.

Another place, mentioned by Strabo, as being associated with Arima, is the island of Ischia, where according to Pherecydes of Athens, Typhon had fled, and in the area where Pindar and others had said Typhon was buried. The connection to Arima, comes from the island&#x27;s Greek name Pithecussae, which derives from the Greek word for monkey, and according to Strabo, residents of the island said that &quot;arimoi&quot; was also the Etruscan word for monkeys.

==Name==
Typhon&#x27;s name has a number of variants. The earliest forms, Typhoeus and Typhaon, occur prior to the 5th century BC. Homer uses Typhoeus, Hesiod and the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot; use both Typhoeus and Typhaon. The later forms Typhos and Typhon occur from the 5th century BC onwards, with Typhon becoming the standard form by the end of that century.

Though several possible derivations of the name Typhon have been suggested, the derivation remains uncertain. Consistent with Hesiod&#x27;s making storm winds Typhon&#x27;s offspring, some have supposed that Typhon was originally a wind-god, and ancient sources associated him with the Greek words &quot;tuphon, tuphos&quot; meaning &quot;whirlwind&quot;. Other theories include derivation from a Greek root meaning &quot;smoke&quot; (consistent with Typhon&#x27;s identification with volcanoes), from an Indo-European root (*&quot;dhuH&quot;-) meaning &quot;abyss&quot; (making Typhon a &quot;Serpent of the Deep&quot;), and from Sapõn the Phoenician name for the Ugaritic god Baal&#x27;s holy mountain Jebel Aqra (the classical Mount Kasios) associated with the epithet Baʿal Sapōn.

The name may have influenced the Persian word &quot;tūfān&quot; which is a source of the meteorological term typhoon.

==Comparative mythology==
===Succession myth===
The Typhonomachy—Zeus&#x27; battle with, and defeat of Typhon—is just one part of a larger &quot;Succession Myth&quot; given in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;. The Hesiodic succession myth describes how Uranus, the original ruler of the cosmos, hid his offspring away inside Gaia, but was overthrown by his Titan son Cronus, who castrated Uranus, and how in turn, Cronus, who swallowed his children as they were born, was himself overthrown by his son Zeus, whose mother had given Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes to swallow, in place of Zeus. However Zeus is then confronted with one final adversary, Typhon, which he quickly defeats. Now clearly the supreme power in the cosmos, Zeus is elected king of gods. Zeus then establishes and secures his realm through the apportionment of various functions and responsibilities to the other gods, and by means of marriage. Finally, by swallowing his first wife Metis, who was destined to produce a son stronger than himself, Zeus is able to put an end to the cycle of succession.

===Python===
Typhon&#x27;s story seems related to that of another monstrous offspring of Gaia: Python, the serpent killed by Apollo at Delphi, suggesting a possible common origin.
Besides the similarity of names, their shared parentage, and the fact that both were snaky monsters killed in single combat with an Olympian god, there are other connections between the stories surrounding Typhon, and those surrounding Python.

Although the Delphic monster killed by Apollo is usually said to be the male serpent Python, in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot;, the earliest account of this story, the god kills a nameless she-serpent (&quot;drakaina&quot;), subsequently called Delphyne, who had been Typhon&#x27;s foster-mother. Delphyne and Echidna, besides both being intimately connected to Typhon—one as mother, the other as mate—share other similarities. Both were half-maid and half-snake, a plague to men, and associated with the Corycian cave in Cilicia.

Python was also perhaps connected with a different Corycian Cave than the one in Cilicia, this one on the slopes of Parnassus above Delphi, and just as the Corycian cave in Cilicia was thought to be Typhon and Echidna&#x27;s lair, and associated with Typhon&#x27;s battle with Zeus, there is evidence to suggest that the Corycian cave above Delphi was supposed to be Python&#x27;s (or Delphyne&#x27;s) lair, and associated with his (or her) battle with Apollo.

===Near Eastern influence===
From at least as early as Pindar, and possibly as early as Homer and Hesiod (with their references to the Arimoi and Arima), Typhon&#x27;s birthplace and battle with Zeus were associated with various Near East locales in Cilicia and Syria, including the Corycian Cave, Mount Kasios, and the Orontes River. Besides this coincidence of place, the Hesiodic succession myth, (including the Typhonomachy), as well as other Greek accounts of these myths, exhibit other parallels with several ancient Near Eastern antecedents, and it is generally held that the Greek accounts are intimately connected with, and influenced by, these Near Eastern counterparts. In particular, the Typhonomachy is generally thought to have been influenced by several Near Eastern monster-slaying myths.

====Mesopotamia====
Three related god vs. monster combat myths from Mesopotamia, date from at least the early second-millennium BC or earlier. These are the battles of the god Ninurta with the monsters Asag and Anzu, and the god Marduk&#x27;s battle with the monstrous Tiamat.

=====Ninurta vs. Asag=====

&quot;Lugal-e&quot;, a late-third-millennium BC Sumerian poem, tells the story of the battle between the Mesopotamian hero-god Ninurta and the terrible monster Asag. Like Typhon, Asag was a monstrous hissing offspring of Earth (Ki), who grew mighty and challenged the rule of Ninurta, who like Zeus, was a storm-god employing winds and floods as weapons. As in Hesiod&#x27;s account of the Typhonomachy, during their battle, both Asag and Ninurta set fire to the landscape. And like Apollodorus&#x27; Typhon, Asag evidently won an initial victory, before being finally overcome by Ninurta.

=====Ninurta vs. Anzû=====
The early second millennium BC Akkadian epic &quot;Anzû&quot; tells the story of another combat of Ninurta with a monstrous challenger. This second foe is the winged monster Anzû, another offspring of Earth. Like Hesiod&#x27;s Typhon, Anzû roared like a lion, and was the source of destructive storm winds. Ninurta destroys Anzû on a mountainside, and is portrayed as lashing the ground where Anzû lay with a rainstorm and floodwaters, just as Homer has Zeus lash the land about Typhon with his thunderbolts.

=====Marduk vs. Tiamat=====

The early second-millennium BC Babylonian-Akkadian creation epic &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot; tells the story of the battle of the Babylonian supreme god Marduk with Tiamat, the Sea personified. Like Zeus, Marduk was a storm-god, who employed wind and lightning as weapons, and who, before he can succeed to the kingship of the gods, must defeat a huge and fearsome enemy in single combat. This time the monster is female, and may be related to the Pythian dragoness Delphyne, or Typhon&#x27;s mate Echidna, since like Echidna, Tiamat was the mother of a brood of monsters.

====Mount Kasios====
Like the Typhonomachy, several Near East myths, tell of battles between a storm-god and a snaky monster associated with Mount Kasios, the modern Jebel Aqra. These myths are usually considered to be the origins of the myth of Zeus&#x27;s battle with Typhon.

=====Baal Sapon vs. Yamm=====
From the south side of the Jebel Aqra, comes the tale of Baal Sapon, and Yamm, the deified Sea (like Tiamat above). Fragmentary Ugaritic tablets, dated to the fourteenth or thirteenth-century BC, tell the story of the Canaanite storm-god Baal Sapon&#x27;s battle against the monstrous Yamm on Mount Sapuna the Canaanite name for later Greeks&#x27; Mount Kasios. Baal defeats Yamm with two throwing clubs (thunderbolts?) named &#x27;Expeller&#x27; and &#x27;Chaser&#x27;, which fly like eagles from the storm-god&#x27;s hands. Other tablets associate the defeat of the snaky Yamm with the slaying of a seven headed serpent &quot;ltn&quot; (Litan/Lotan), apparently corresponding to the biblical Leviathan.

=====Tarhunna vs. Illuyanka=====

From the north side of the Jebel Aqra, come Hittite myths, c. 1250 BC, which tell two versions of the storm-god Tarhunna&#x27;s (Tarhunta&#x27;s) battle against the serpent Illuyanka(s). In both of these versions, Tarhunna suffers an initial defeat against Illuyanka. In one version, Tarhunna seeks help from the goddess Inara, who lures Illuyanka from his lair with a banquet, thereby enabling Tarhunna to surprise and kill Illuyanka. In the other version Illuyanka steals the heart and eyes of the defeated god, but Tarhunna&#x27;s son marries a daughter of Illuyanka and is able to retrieve Tarhunna&#x27;s stolen body parts, whereupon Tarhunna kills Illuyanka.

These stories particularly resemble details found in the accounts of the Typhonomachy of Apollodorus, Oppian and Nonnus, which, though late accounts, possibly preserve much earlier ones: The storm-god&#x27;s initial defeat (Apollodorus, Nonnus), the loss of vital body parts (sinews: Apollodorus, Nonnus), the help of allies (Hermes and Aegipan: Apollodorus; Cadmos and Pan: Nonnus; Pan: Oppian), the luring of the serpentine opponent from his lair through the trickery of a banquet (Oppian, or by music: Nonnus).

=====Teshub vs. Hedammu and Ullikummi=====
Another c. 1250 BC Hittite text, derived from the Hurrians, tells of the Hurrian storm-god Teshub (with whom the Hittite&#x27;s Tarhunna came to be identified) who lived on Mount Hazzi, the Hurrian name for the Jebel Aqra, and his battle with the sea-serpent Hedammu. Again the storm-god is aided by a goddess Sauska (equivalent to Inaru), who this time seduces the monster with music (as in Nonnus), drink, and sex, successfully luring the serpent from his lair in the sea. Just as the Typhonomachy can be seen as a sequel to the Titanomachy, a different Hittite text derived from the Hurrians, &quot;The Song of Ullikummi&quot;, a kind of sequel to the Hittite &quot;kingship in heaven&quot; succession myths of which the story of Teshub and Hedammu formed a part, tells of a second monster, this time made of stone, named Ullikummi that Teshub must defeat, in order to secure his rule.

====Set====
From apparently as early as Hecataeus of Miletus (), Typhon was identified with Set, the Egyptian god of chaos and storms. This syncretization with Egyptian mythology can also be seen in the story, apparently known as early as Pindar, of Typhon chasing the gods to Egypt, and the gods transforming themselves into animals. Such a story arose perhaps as a way for the Greeks to explain Egypt&#x27;s animal-shaped gods. Herodotus also identified Typhon with Set, making him the second to last divine king of Egypt. Herodotus says that Typhon was deposed by Osiris&#x27; son Horus, whom Herodutus equates with Apollo (with Osiris being equated with Dionysus), and after his defeat by Horus, Typhon was &quot;supposed to have been hidden&quot; in the &quot;Serbonian marsh&quot; (identified with modern Lake Bardawil) in Egypt.

==Confused with the Giants==
Typhon bears a close resemblance to an older generation of descendants of Gaia, the Giants. They, like their younger brother Typhon after them, challenged Zeus for supremacy of the cosmos, were (in later representations) shown as snake-footed, and end up buried under volcanos.

While distinct in early accounts, in later accounts Typhon was often considered to be one of the Giants. The &quot;Fabulae&quot; (c. 2nd century AD), a Latin handbook of mythology, includes Typhon in its list of Giants, while the Roman poet Horace (65 – 8 BC), mentions Typhon, along with the Giants Mimas, Porphyrion, and Enceladus, as together battling Athena, during the Gigantomachy. The &quot;Astronomica&quot;, attributed to the 1st-century AD Roman poet and astrologer Marcus Manilius, and the late 4th-century early 5th-century Greek poet Nonnus, also consider Typhon to be one of the Giants.

<text>The lyre () (from Greek λύρα and Latin &quot;lyra)&quot; is a stringed musical instrument that is classified by Hornbostel–Sachs as a member of the lute family of instruments. In organology, a lyre is considered a yoke lute, since it is a lute in which the strings are attached to a yoke that lies in the same plane as the sound table, and consists of two arms and a crossbar.

The lyre has its origins in ancient history. Lyres were used in several ancient cultures surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The earliest known examples of the lyre have been recovered at archeological sites that date to c. 2700 BCE in Mesopotamia.

 The oldest lyres from the Fertile Crescent are known as the eastern lyres and are distinguished from other ancient lyres by their flat base. They have been found at archaeological sites in Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and the Levant.

The round lyre or the Western lyre also originated in Syria and Anatolia, but was not as widely used and eventually died out in the east c. 1750 BCE. The round lyre, so called for its rounded base, reappeared in ancient Greece c. 1700–1400 BCE, and then later spread throughout the Roman Empire. This lyre served as the origin of the European lyre known as the Germanic lyre or [[Rotte (instrument)|rotte]] that was widely used in north-western Europe from pre-Christian to medieval times.

==Etymology==
The earliest reference to the word &quot;lyre&quot; is the Mycenaean Greek &quot;ru-ra-ta-e&quot;, meaning &quot;lyrists&quot; and written in the Linear B script. In classical Greek, the word &quot;lyre&quot; could either refer specifically to an amateur instrument, which is a smaller version of the professional cithara and eastern-Aegean barbiton, or &quot;lyre&quot; can refer generally to all three instruments as a family. The English word comes via Latin from the Greek.

==Classification==

Hornbostel–Sachs classifies the lyre as a member of the lute-family of instruments which is one of the families under the chordophone classification of instruments. Hornbostel–Sachs divide lyres into two groups Bowl lyres (321.21), Box lyres (321.22).
 In organology, a lyre is considered a yoke lute, since it is a lute in which the strings are attached to a yoke that lies in the same plane as the sound table, and consists of two arms and a crossbar.

==Ancient lyres==
There is evidence of the development of many forms of lyres from the period 2700 BCE through 700 BCE. Lyres from the ancient world are divided by scholars into two separate groups, the eastern lyres and the western lyres, which are defined by patterns of geography and chronology.

===Eastern lyres===
Eastern lyres, also known as flat-based lyres, are lyres which originated in the Fertile Crescent (Mesoptamia) in what is present day Syria, Anatolia, the Levant and Egypt. The eastern lyres all contain sound boxes with flat bases. They are the oldest lyres with iconographical evidence of their existence, such as depictions of the eastern lyre on pottery, dating back to 2700 BCE.

While flat-based lyres originated in the East, they were also later found in the West after 700 BCE. By the Hellenistic period (c. 330 BCE) what was once a clearly divided use of flat-based lyres in the East and round-based lyres in the West had disappeared, as trade routes between the East and the West dispersed both kinds of instruments across more geographic regions.

Eastern lyres are divided into four main types: bull lyres, thick lyres, thin lyres and giant lyres.

====Bull lyres==== 
Bull lyres are a type of eastern lyre that have a flat base and bull&#x27;s head on one side. The &quot;lyres of Ur&quot; are bull lyres excavated in ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), which date to 2500 BCE and are considered to be the world&#x27;s oldest surviving stringed instruments. However, older pictorial evidence of bull lyres exist in other parts of Mesopotamia and Elam, including Susa.

====Thick lyres====
Thick lyres are a type of flat-based eastern lyre that comes from Egypt (2000–100 BCE) and Anatolia (c. 1600 BCE). The thick lyre is distinguished by a thicker sound box which allowed for the inclusion of more strings. These strings were held on a larger &#x27;box-bridge&#x27; than the other type of eastern lyres, and the sound hole of the instrument was cut in the body of the lyre behind the box-bridge.

While similar to the bull lyre in size, the thick lyre did not contain the head of an animal, but did depict images of animals on the arms or yoke of the instrument. Like the bull lyre, the thick lyre did not use a plectrum but was plucked by hand.

While the clearest examples of the thick lyre are extant to archaeological sites in Egypt and Anatolia, similar large lyres with thicker soundboxes have been found in Mesopotamia (1900–1500 BCE). However, these Mesopotamia lyres lack the box-bridge found in the instruments from Egypt and Anatolia.

====Thin lyres====
Thin lyres are a type of flat-based eastern lyre with a thinner soundbox where the sound hole is created by leaving the base of the resonator open. The earliest known example of the thin lyre dates to c. 2500 BCE in Syria. After this, examples of the thin lyre can be found throughout the Fertile Crescent. The thin lyre is the only one of the ancient eastern lyres that is still used in instrument design today among current practitioners of the instrument. As a means of support, players of the thin lyre wear a sling around the left wrist which is also attached to the base of the lyre&#x27;s right arm. It is played using a plectrum or pic to strike the strings; a technique later used by the Greeks on the western lyres.

There are several regional variations in the design of thin lyres. The Egyptian thin lyre was characterized by arms that bulged outwards asymmetrically; a feature also found later in Samaria (c. 375–323 BCE). In contrast, thin lyres in Syria and Phoenicia (c. 700 BCE) were symmetrical in shape and had straight arms with a perpendicular yoke which formed the outline of a rectangle.

The kinnor is an ancient Israelite musical instrument that is thought to be a type of thin lyre based on iconographic archaeological evidence. It is the first instrument from the lyre family mentioned in the Old Testament. Its exact identification is unclear, but in the modern day it is generally translated as &quot;harp&quot; or &quot;lyre&quot;, and associated with a type of lyre depicted in Israelite imagery, particularly the Bar Kochba coins. It has been referred to as the &quot;national instrument&quot; of the Jewish people, and modern luthiers have created reproduction lyres of the &quot;kinnor&quot; based on this imagery.

====Giant lyres====
Giant lyres are a type of flat-based eastern lyre of immense size that typically required two players. Played from a standing position, the instrument stood taller than the instrumentalists. The oldest extent example of the instrument was found in the ancient city of Uruk in what is present day Iraq, and dates to c. 2500 BCE. Well preserved giant lyres dating to c. 1600 BCE have been found in Anatolia. The instrument reached the height of its popularity in Ancient Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten (c. 1353—1336 BCE). A giant lyre found in the ancient city of Susa (c. 2500 BCE) is suspected to have been played by only a single instrumentalist, and giant lyres in Egypt dating from the Hellenistic period most likely also required only a single player.

===Western lyres===
Western lyres, sometimes referred to as round-based lyres, are lyres from the ancient history that were extant in the Aegean, Greece and Italy. They initially contained only round rather than flat bases; but by the Hellenistic period both constructs of lyre could be found in these regions. Like the flat-based Eastern lyres, the round-based lyre also originated in northern Syria and southern Anatolia in the 3rd millennium BCE. However, this round-based construction of the lyre was less common than its flat-based counterparts in the east, and by c. 1750 BCE the instrument had died out completely in this region. The round-based lyre re-appeared in the West in Ancient Greece where it was sole form of lyre used between 1400 BCE and 700 BCE.

Like the eastern flat-based lyre, the western round-based lyre also had several sub-types. Homer described two different western lyres in his writings, the phorminx and kitharis. However, both of these terms have not had uniform meaning across time, and their use during Homer&#x27;s time was later altered. Today, scholars divide instruments referred to as kitharis into two subgroups, the round-based cylinder kithara and the flat-based concert kithara.

====Phorminx====

==Cultural use in Ancient Greece==

In Ancient Greece, recitations of lyric poetry were accompanied by lyre playing. The earliest picture of a Greek lyre appears in the famous sarcophagus of Hagia Triada (a Minoan settlement in Crete). The sarcophagus was used during the Mycenaean occupation of Crete ().

The lyre of classical antiquity was ordinarily played by being strummed like a guitar or a zither, rather than being plucked with the fingers as with a harp. A pick called a plectrum was held in one hand, while the fingers of the free hand silenced the unwanted strings.

=== Construction ===
A classical lyre has a hollow body or sound-chest (also known as soundbox or resonator), which, in ancient Greek tradition, was made out of turtle shell. Extending from this sound-chest are two raised arms, which are sometimes hollow, and are curved both outward and forward. They are connected near the top by a crossbar or yoke. An additional crossbar, fixed to the sound-chest, makes the bridge, which transmits the vibrations of the strings. The deepest note was that closest to the player&#x27;s body; since the strings did not differ much in length, more weight may have been gained for the deeper notes by thicker strings, as in the violin and similar modern instruments, or they were tuned by having a slacker &quot;tension&quot;. The strings were of gut (animal intestines). They were stretched between the yoke and bridge, or to a tailpiece below the bridge. There were two ways of tuning: one was to fasten the strings to pegs that might be turned, while the other was to change the placement of the string on the crossbar; it is likely that both expedients were used simultaneously.

Lyres were used without a fingerboard, no Greek description or representation having ever been met with that can be construed as referring to one. Nor was a bow possible, the flat sound-board being an insuperable impediment. The pick, or plectrum, however, was in constant use. It was held in the right hand to set the upper strings in vibration; when not in use, it hung from the instrument by a ribbon. The fingers of the left hand touched the lower strings (presumably to silence those whose notes were not wanted).

=== Number of strings ===
Before Greek civilization had assumed its historic form (c. 1200 BCE), there was likely to have been great freedom and independence of different localities in the matter of lyre stringing, which is corroborated by the antique use of the chromatic (half-tone) and enharmonic (quarter-tone) tunings - pointing to an early exuberance, and perhaps also to a bias towards refinements of intonation. The number of strings on the classical lyre therefore varied, with three, four, six, seven, eight and ten having been popular at various times.

The priest and biographer Plutarch (c. 100 CE) wrote of the musicians of the archaic period Olympus and Terpander, that they used only three strings to accompany their recitation; but there is no evidence for or against this dating from that period. The earliest known lyre had four strings, tuned to create a tetrachord or series of four tones filling in the interval of a perfect fourth. By doubling the tetrachord a lyre with seven or eight strings was obtained. Likewise the three-stringed lyre may have given rise to the six-stringed lyre depicted on many archaic Greek vases. The accuracy of this representation cannot be insisted upon, the vase painters being little mindful of the complete expression of details; yet one may suppose their tendency would be rather to imitate than to invent a number. It was their constant practice to represent the strings as being damped by the fingers of the left hand of the player, after having been struck by the plectrum held in the right hand.

=== Origin ===
According to ancient Greek mythology, the young god Hermes stole a herd of sacred cows from Apollo. In order not to be followed, he made shoes for the cows which were facing backwards, making it appear that the animals had walked in the opposite direction. Apollo, following the trails, could not follow where the cows were going. Along the way, Hermes slaughtered one of the cows and offered all but the entrails to the gods. From the entrails and a tortoise/turtle shell, he created the Lyre. Apollo, figuring out it was Hermes who had his cows, confronted the young god. Apollo was furious, but after hearing the sound of the lyre, his anger faded. Apollo offered to trade the herd of cattle for the lyre. Hence, the creation of the lyre is attributed to Hermes. Other sources credit it to Apollo himself.

Some of the cultures using and developing the lyre were the Aeolian and Ionian Greek colonies on the coasts of Asia (ancient Asia Minor, modern day Turkey) bordering the Lydian empire. Some mythic masters like Musaeus, and Thamyris were believed to have been born in Thrace, another place of extensive Greek colonization. The name &quot;kissar&quot; (cithara) given by the ancient Greeks to Egyptian box instruments reveals the apparent similarities recognized by Greeks themselves. The cultural peak of ancient Egypt, and thus the possible age of the earliest instruments of this type, predates the 5th century classic Greece. This indicates the possibility that the lyre might have existed in one of Greece&#x27;s neighboring countries, either Thrace, Lydia, or Egypt, and was introduced into Greece at pre-classic times.

==Central and Northern European lyres==
Other instruments known as lyres have been fashioned and used in Europe outside the Greco-Roman world since at least the Iron Age. Lyres are depicted on ceramic and bronze vessels of the Proto-Celtic Hallstatt culture across central Europe. Among them there are lyres with rounded bottoms, stringed instruments whose resonators seem to be missing and lyres with strongly curved yokes and single or double bulging resonators. The number of strings depicted varies from two to ten. Fragmented tuning pegs and bridges made of wood have been discovered from the Iron Age industrial settlement in the Ramsau valley at Dürrnberg, Austria. Possible further wooden tuning pegs have been found in Glastonbury in Somerset in England and Biskupin in Poland. The remains of what is thought to be the bridge of a 2300-year-old lyre were discovered on the Isle of Skye, Scotland in 2010.

In 1988, a stone bust from the 2nd or 1st century BCE was discovered in Brittany, France which depicts a figure wearing a torc playing a seven-string lyre.

The Germanic lyre is representative of a separate strand of lyre development. Appearing in warrior graves of the first millennium CE, these lyres differ from the lyres of the Mediterranean antiquity, by a long, shallow and broadly rectangular shape, with a hollow soundbox curving at the base, and two hollow arms connected across the top by an integrated crossbar or ‘yoke. Famous examples include the lyre from the ship burial at Sutton Hoo, and the decayed lyre discovered in silhouette at the Prittlewell royal Anglo-Saxon burial in Essex. The waterlogged lyre recovered from a grave at Trossingen, Germany, in 2001 is the best-preserved example found so far.

==Bowed lyres==

Some instruments called &quot;lyres&quot; were played with a bow in Europe and parts of the Middle East, namely the Arabic rebab and its descendants, including the Byzantine lyra.

After the bow made its way into Europe from the Middle-East, it was applied to several species of those lyres that were small enough to make bowing practical. The dates of origin and other evolutionary details of the European bowed lyres continue to be disputed among organologists, but there is general agreement that none of them were the ancestors of modern orchestral bowed stringed instruments, as once was thought.

There came to be two different kinds of bowed European lyres: those with fingerboards, and those without.

The last surviving examples of instruments within the latter class were the Scandinavian talharpa and the Finnish jouhikko. Different tones could be obtained from a single bowed string by pressing the fingernails of the player&#x27;s left hand against various points along the string to fret the string.

The last of the bowed lyres with a fingerboard was the &quot;modern&quot; () Welsh crwth. It had several predecessors both in the British Isles and in Continental Europe. Pitch was changed on individual strings by pressing the string firmly against the fingerboard with the fingertips. Like a violin, this method shortened the vibrating length of the string to produce higher tones, while releasing the finger gave the string a greater vibrating length, thereby producing a tone lower in pitch. This is the principle on which the modern violin and guitar work.

==Modern lyres==
==In popular culture==

The term is also used metaphorically to refer to the work or skill of a poet, as in Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is&quot; or Byron&#x27;s &quot;I wish to tune my quivering lyre, / To deeds of fame, and notes of fire&quot;.

==Other instruments called &quot;lyres&quot;==
Over time, the name in the wider Hellenic space came to be used to label mostly bowed lutes such as the Byzantine lyra, the Pontic lyra, the Constantinopolitan lyra, the Cretan lyra, the lira da braccio, the Calabrian lira, the lijerica, the lyra viol, the lirone.

<doc id="81776" wikidata="Q748296" url="?curid=81776" title="Laertes (father of Odysseus)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Laertes (; ; also spelled Laërtes) was the king of the Cephallenians, an ethnic group who lived both on the Ionian Islands and on the mainland. He presumably inherited the kingdom from his father Arcesius and grandfather Cephalus. His realm included Ithaca and surrounding islands, and perhaps even the neighboring part of the mainland of other Greek city-states. Laertes was also an Argonaut, and a participant in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar.

== Family ==
Laertes was the son of Arcesius and Chalcomedusa; and the father of Odysseus (who was thus called &quot;Laertiádēs&quot;, Λαερτιάδης, &quot;son of Laertes&quot;) and Ctimene by his wife Anticlea, daughter of the thief Autolycus. Another account says that Laertes was not Odysseus&#x27;s true father; rather, it was Sisyphus, who had seduced Anticlea.

== Mythology ==
Laertes stays away from Odysseus&#x27; home while Odysseus is gone. He keeps to himself on his farm, overcome with grief over Odysseus&#x27; absence and alone after his wife, Anticleia, died from grief herself. Odysseus finally comes to see Laertes after he has killed all the suitors competing for Penelope. He finds his father spading a plant, looking old and tired and filled with sadness. Odysseus keeps his identity to himself at first, identifying himself only as Quarrelman, only son of King Allwoes (in the Fitzgerald translation of Homer), but when he sees how disappointed Laertes is to learn that this &quot;stranger&quot; has no news of his son, Odysseus reveals himself, and proves his identity by reciting all the trees he received from Laertes when he was a boy. This emphasis on the land of Ithaca itself perhaps signifies that Odysseus has finally reconnected with his homeland, and his journey is over.

Laertes had trained Odysseus in husbandry. After their reunion, the two of them go to Odysseus&#x27; home to fend off the families of the dead suitors. Athena infuses vigour into Laertes, so he can help Odysseus. He kills Eupeithes, father of Antinous. Three years after Odysseus&#x27; return, Laertes died.

<text>In Greek mythology, Arcesius, Arceisius, Arkeisios or Arcisius () was the son of either Zeus or Cephalus, and king in Ithaca.

==Mythology==
According to scholia on the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Arcesius&#x27; parents were Zeus and Euryodeia; Ovid also writes of Arcesius as a son of Zeus. Other sources make him a son of Cephalus. Aristotle in his lost work &quot;The State of the Ithacians&quot; cited a myth according to which Cephalus was instructed by an oracle to mate with the first female being he should encounter if he wanted to have offspring; Cephalus mated with a she-bear, who then transformed into a human woman and bore him a son, Arcesius. Hyginus makes Arcesius a son of Cephalus and Procris, while Eustathius and the exegetical scholia to the &quot;Iliad&quot; report a version according to which Arcesius was a grandson of Cephalus through Cillus or Celeus.

Zeus made Arcesius&#x27; line one of &quot;only sons&quot;: his only son was Laertes, whose only son was Odysseus, whose only son was Telemachus. Arcesius&#x27;s wife (and thus mother of Laertes) was Chalcomedusa.

==Arcesius line==
Arceisiades () was a patronymic from Arcesius, which Laertes as well as his son, Odysseus, is designated by. 

==Namesakes==
Of another Arcesius, an architect, Vitruvius (vii, introduction) notes: &quot;Arcesius, on the Corinthian order proportions, and on the Ionic order temple of Aesculapius at Tralles, which it is said that he built with his own hands.&quot;

<text>David Byrne (; born 14 May 1952) is a Scottish-American musician, writer, visual artist, and filmmaker. He was a founding member, principal songwriter, lead singer, and guitarist of the American new wave band Talking Heads.

Byrne has released solo recordings and worked with various media including film, photography, opera, fiction, and non-fiction. He has received an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, a Special Tony Award, and a Golden Globe Award, and he is an inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of Talking Heads.

==Early life and education==
David Byrne was born on 14 May 1952 in Dumbarton, Dunbartonshire, Scotland, the elder of two children born to Tom (from Lambhill, Glasgow) and Emma Byrne. Byrne&#x27;s father was Catholic and his mother Presbyterian. Two years after his birth, the family moved to Canada, settling in Hamilton, Ontario. The family left Scotland in part because there were few jobs requiring his father&#x27;s engineering skills and in part because of the tensions in the extended family caused by his parents&#x27; interfaith marriage. When Byrne was eight or nine years old they moved to Arbutus, Maryland, in the United States, where his father worked as an electronics engineer at Westinghouse Electric Corporation and his mother later became a teacher. Byrne stated that he initially grew up speaking with a Scottish accent but adopted an American one in order to fit in at school. He later recalled &quot;I felt like a bit of an outsider. But then I realized the world was made up of people who were all different. But we&#x27;re all here.&quot;

Before high school, Byrne already knew how to play the guitar, accordion, and violin. He was rejected from his middle school&#x27;s choir because they said he was &quot;off-key and too withdrawn&quot;. From a young age, he had a strong interest in music. His parents say that he would constantly play his phonograph from age three and he learned how to play the harmonica at age five. His father used his electrical engineering skills to modify a reel-to-reel tape recorder so that Byrne could make multitrack recordings.

Byrne graduated from Lansdowne High School in southwest Baltimore County, Maryland. He attended the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in Providence, Rhode Island, during the 1970–71 term and the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore during the 1971–72 term before dropping out.

==Career==
===Early career: 1971–1974===
He started his musical career in a high school band called Revelation. Between 1971 and 1972, he was one half of a duo named Bizadi with Marc Kehoe. Their repertoire consisted mostly of songs such as &quot;April Showers&quot;, &quot;96 Tears&quot;, &quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot; and Frank Sinatra songs. He returned to Providence in 1973 and formed a band called the Artistics with fellow RISD student Chris Frantz. The band dissolved in 1974. Byrne moved to New York City in May that year, and in September of that year, Frantz and his girlfriend Tina Weymouth followed suit. After Byrne and Frantz were unable to find a bass guitar player in New York for nearly two years, Weymouth learned to play the instrument. While working day jobs in late 1974, they were contemplating a band.

===Talking Heads: 1975–1991===

By January 1975, Talking Heads were practicing and playing together, while still working normal day jobs. They played their first gig in June.

In May 1976, Byrne quit his day job, and the three-piece band signed to Sire Records in November of that year. Byrne was the youngest member of the band. Multi-instrumentalist Jerry Harrison, previously of The Modern Lovers, joined the band in 1977. The band released eight studio albums to critical acclaim and commercial success. Four albums achieved gold status (exceeding 500,000 in sales) and two others were certified double-platinum (exceeding two million in sales). Talking Heads were pioneers of the new wave music scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s with popular and creative music videos in regular rotation on MTV.

In 1988 the band quietly went on hiatus during which Byrne launched a solo career and the other members pursued their own projects. Talking Heads reunited in 1991 to record the single &quot;Sax and Violins&quot; and officially split in December 1991.

In 2002, Talking Heads was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, where they reunited to play three tracks, including &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; and &quot;Burning Down the House&quot;.

===Solo album career: 1979–1981, 1989–present===

During his time in the band, David Byrne took on outside projects, collaborating with Brian Eno during 1979 and 1981 on the album &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot;, which attracted considerable critical acclaim due to its early use of analogue sampling and found sounds. Following this record, Byrne focused his attention on Talking Heads. &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot; was re-released for its 25th anniversary in early 2006, with new bonus tracks. In keeping with the spirit of the original album, stems for two of the songs&#x27; component tracks were released under Creative Commons licenses and a remix contest website was launched.

&quot;Rei Momo&quot; (1989) was the first solo album by Byrne after leaving Talking Heads, and features mainly Afro-Cuban, Afro-Hispanic, and Brazilian song styles, including popular dances such as merengue, son cubano, samba, mambo, cumbia, cha-cha-chá, bomba and charanga. His third solo album, &quot;Uh-Oh&quot; (1992), featured a brass section and was driven by tracks such as &quot;Girls on My Mind&quot; and &quot;The Cowboy Mambo (Hey Lookit Me Now)&quot;. His fourth solo album, titled &quot;David Byrne&quot; (1994), was a more proper rock record, with Byrne playing most of the instruments on it, leaving percussion for session musicians. &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Back in the Box&quot; were the two main singles released from the album. The first one entered the US Modern Rock Tracks chart, reaching No. 24. For his fifth studio effort, the emotional &quot;Feelings&quot; (1997), Byrne employed a brass orchestra called Black Cat Orchestra. His sixth, &quot;Look into the Eyeball&quot; (2001), continued the same musical exploration of &quot;Feelings&quot;, but was compiled of more upbeat tracks, like those found on &quot;Uh-Oh&quot;.

&quot;Grown Backwards&quot; (2004), released by Nonesuch Records, used orchestral string arrangements, and includes two operatic arias as well as a rework of X-Press 2 collaboration &quot;Lazy&quot;. He also launched a North American and Australian tour with the Tosca Strings. This tour ended with Los Angeles, San Diego and New York shows in August 2005. He also collaborated with Selena on her 1995 album &quot;Dreaming of You&quot; with &quot;God&#x27;s Child (Baila Conmigo)&quot;.

Byrne and Eno reunited for his eighth album &quot;Everything That Happens Will Happen Today&quot; (2008). He assembled a band to tour worldwide for the album for a six-month period from late 2008 through early 2009 on the Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno Tour.

In 2012, he released a collaborative album with American singer-songwriter St. Vincent called &quot;Love This Giant&quot;. The album featured both Byrne and St. Vincent on vocals and guitar, backed by a brass section. To promote the album, both artists travelled throughout North America, Europe, and Australia on the Love This Giant Tour in 2012 and 2013, with each performing pieces from their career in the album&#x27;s distinctive brass band style alongside those composed for the album.

In January 2018, Byrne announced his first solo album in 14 years. &quot;American Utopia&quot; was released in March through Todo Mundo and Nonesuch Records. He also released the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Coming to My House&quot;, which he co-wrote with Eno. The subsequent tour – which showcased songs from &quot;American Utopia&quot; alongside highlights from his Talking Heads and solo career to date – was described by &quot;NME&quot; as being perhaps &quot;the most ambitious and impressive live show of all time&quot;, blurring the lines &quot;between gig and theatre, poetry and dance&quot;.

===Work in theatre, film, and television: 1981–present===
In 1981, Byrne partnered with choreographer Twyla Tharp, scoring music he wrote that appeared on his album &quot;The Catherine Wheel&quot; for a ballet with the same name, prominently featuring unusual rhythms and lyrics. Productions of &quot;The Catherine Wheel&quot; appeared on Broadway that same year.

He was chiefly responsible for the stage design and choreography of the concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; (1984).

Byrne wrote the Dirty Dozen Brass Band-inspired score &quot;Music for &quot;The Knee Plays&quot;&quot;, released in 1985, for Robert Wilson&#x27;s vast five-act opera &quot;The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down&quot;.

He wrote, directed, and starred in &quot;True Stories&quot; (1986), a musical collage of discordant Americana for which he also produced most of the film&#x27;s music. He was impressed by the experimental theatre that he saw in New York City in the 1970s and collaborated with several of its best-known representatives. He worked with Robert Wilson on &quot;The Knee Plays&quot; and &quot;The Forest&quot;, and invited Spalding Gray (of The Wooster Group) to act in &quot;True Stories&quot;, while Meredith Monk provided a portion of the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

Byrne also provided a soundtrack for JoAnne Akalaitis&#x27; film &quot;Dead End Kids&quot; (1986), made after a Mabou Mines theatre production. Byrne&#x27;s artistic outlook has a great deal in common with the work of these artists. The same year he also added &quot;Loco de Amor&quot; with Celia Cruz to Jonathan Demme&#x27;s film &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1986).

His work has been extensively used in film soundtracks, most notably in collaboration with Ryuichi Sakamoto and Cong Su on Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987), which won an Academy Award for Best Original Score.

Some of the music from Byrne&#x27;s orchestral album &quot;The Forest&quot; was originally used in a Robert Wilson–directed theatre piece titled &quot;The Forest&quot;. The play premiered at the &quot;Theater der Freien Volksbühne&quot;, Berlin, in 1988. It received its New York premiere in December 1988 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM). The Forestry Maxi-single contained dance and industrial remixes of pieces from &quot;The Forest&quot; by Jack Dangers, Rudy Tambala, and Anthony Capel. Byrne released his soundtrack album in 1991.

Byrne also directed the documentary &quot;Île Aiye&quot; (1989) and the concert film of his 1992 Latin-tinged tour titled &quot;Between the Teeth&quot; (1994).

&quot;In Spite of Wishing and Wanting&quot; is a soundscape Byrne produced in 1999 for Belgian choreographer Wim Vandekeybus&#x27;s dance company Ultima Vez.

In 2003, Byrne guest starred as himself on a season 14 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Released the same year, &quot;Lead Us Not into Temptation&quot; included tracks and musical experiments from his score to film &quot;Young Adam&quot; (2003).

In late 2005, Byrne and Fatboy Slim began work on &quot;Here Lies Love&quot;, a disco opera or song cycle about the life of Imelda Marcos, the controversial former First Lady of the Philippines. Some music from this piece was debuted at Adelaide Festival of Arts in Australia in February 2006 and the following year at Carnegie Hall on 3 February 2007.

In 2008, Byrne released &quot;Big Love: Hymnal&quot; – his soundtrack to season two of &quot;Big Love&quot;, which aired in 2007. These two albums constituted the first releases on his independent record label Todo Mundo. Byrne and Brian Eno provided the soundtrack for the film &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot; (2010).

In 2015, he organised &quot;Contemporary Color&quot;, two arena concerts in Brooklyn and Toronto, for which he brought in ten musical acts who teamed up with ten color guard groups. The concerts were made into a 2016 documentary film, directed by the Ross brothers, and produced by Byrne.

He collaborated with Stanford University professor Mala Gaonkar in 2016 to co-create NEUROSOCIETY, a guided immersive theater performance.

In October 2019, his &quot;American Utopia&quot; opened at the Hudson Theatre on Broadway. Byrne appeared in comedian John Mulaney&#x27;s children&#x27;s musical comedy special &quot;John Mulaney &amp; the Sack Lunch Bunch&quot; (2019), where he performed the song &quot;Pay Attention!&quot; His song &quot;Tiny Apocalypse&quot; was also featured as the special&#x27;s end credits song.

On February 29, 2020, after a 30-year absence, Byrne performed as the musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with John Mulaney as host. Byrne performed &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; and &quot;Toe Jam&quot; with the cast of the Broadway show &quot;American Utopia&quot; and appears in the &quot;Airport Sushi&quot; sketch singing a parody of &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot;. This was Byrne&#x27;s third appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. He previously served as the musical guest as part of Talking Heads in 1979, and as a solo musical guest in 1989.

In 2022, Byrne again collaborated with Mala Gaonkar on another immersive theater production based on his life, &quot;Theater of the Mind&quot; transforming a 15,000 square-foot warehouse in Denver, Colorado.

===Other musical contributions: 1990–present===

Byrne has contributed songs to five AIDS benefit compilation albums produced by the Red Hot Organization: &quot;Red Hot + Blue: A Tribute to Cole Porter&quot;, &quot;Red Hot + Rio&quot;, &quot;Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin&quot;, &quot;Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. He appeared as a guest vocalist/guitarist for 10,000 Maniacs during their &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; concert, though the songs in which he is featured were cut from the following album. One of them, &quot;Let the Mystery Be&quot;, appeared as the fourth track on 10,000 Maniacs&#x27; CD single &quot;Few and Far Between&quot;.

On 24 March 1992, he performed with Richard Thompson at St. Ann &amp; The Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights, New York. The concert was recorded and released as &quot;An Acoustic Evening&quot;. Byrne worked with Latin superstar Selena in March 1995; writing, producing and singing a bilingual duet titled &quot;God&#x27;s Child (Baila Conmigo)&quot;. This became the last song Selena recorded before she was murdered on March 31, 1995. The song was included on the singer&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;Dreaming of You&quot;.

In 1997, he was the host of &quot;Sessions at West 54th&quot; during its second of three seasons and collaborated with members of Devo and Morcheeba to record the album &quot;Feelings&quot;.

In 2001, a version of Byrne&#x27;s single &quot;Like Humans Do&quot;, edited to remove its marijuana reference, was selected by Microsoft as the sample music for Windows XP to demonstrate Windows Media Player.

In 2002, Byrne co-wrote and provided vocals for a track, &quot;Lazy&quot; by X-Press 2, which reached No. 2 in the United Kingdom and number-one on the US Dance Charts. He said in an interview on BBC Four &quot;Sessions&quot; coverage of his Union Chapel performance that &quot;Lazy&quot; was number-one in Syria. The track later featured with orchestral arrangements on his &quot;Grown Backwards&quot; (2004) album.

In September 2004, Byrne co-authored a CD collection and performed with Gilberto Gil at a benefit concert promoting the Creative Commons license.

In 2006, his singing was featured on &quot;The Heart&#x27;s a Lonely Hunter&quot; on &quot;The Cosmic Game&quot; by Thievery Corporation.

In 2007, he provided a cover of the Fiery Furnaces&#x27; song &quot;Ex-Guru&quot; for a compilation to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of Thrill Jockey, a Chicago-based record label.

In April 2008, Byrne took part in the Paul Simon retrospective concert series at BAM performing &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; and &quot;I Know What I Know&quot; from Simon&#x27;s &quot;Graceland&quot; album. Later that year, Byrne and his production team turned the Battery Maritime Building, a 99-year-old ferry terminal in Manhattan, into a playable musical instrument. The structure was connected electronically to a pipe organ and made playable for a piece called &quot;Playing the Building&quot;. This project was previously installed in Stockholm in 2005, and later at the London Roundhouse in 2009. Byrne says that the point of the project was to allow people to experience art first hand, by creating music with the organ, rather than simply looking at it. Also in 2008, he collaborated with the Brighton Port Authority, composing the music and singing the lyrics for &quot;Toe Jam&quot;.

Byrne is featured on the tracks &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;The People Tree&quot;, on N.A.S.A.&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;The Spirit of Apollo&quot;. In 2009, he also appeared on HIV/AIDS charity album &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot; for Red Hot Organization. He collaborated with Dirty Projectors on the song &quot;Knotty Pine&quot;. In the same year, Byrne performed at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. He also was a signator of a letter protesting the decision of the Toronto International Film Festival to choose Tel Aviv as the subject of its inaugural City-to-City Spotlight strand.

In May 2011, Byrne contributed backing vocals to the Arcade Fire track &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; which appeared on the deluxe edition of their 2010 album &quot;The Suburbs&quot;.

Jherek Bischoff&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Composed&quot; features Byrne on the track &quot;Eyes&quot;. The same year, he also released a show recorded with Caetano Veloso in 2004 at New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall (&quot;Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;).

In March 2013, he debuted a fully staged production of his 2010 concept album &quot;Here Lies Love&quot; at New York&#x27;s Public Theater, directed by Tony Award-nominee Alex Timbers following its premiere at MoCA earlier in the year. That same month, he and Sakamoto released a re-recording of their 1994 collaboration &quot;Psychedelic Afternoon&quot; to raise money and awareness for children impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

In May 2014, Byrne announced his involvement with Anna Calvi&#x27;s EP, &quot;Strange Weather&quot;, collaborating with her on two songs: a cover of Keren Ann&#x27;s &quot;Strange Weather&quot; and Connan Mockasin&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m the Man, That Will Find You&quot;.

In August 2016, he was featured on &quot;Snoopies&quot; on the Kickstarter-funded album, &quot;And the Anonymous Nobody...&quot; by De La Soul.

In 2022, he co-wrote and provided vocals on the song &quot;This Is a Life&quot; for the original soundtrack to the 2022 film &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;, alongside the film&#x27;s composers Son Lux and American singer Mitski. Byrne performed the song with Son Lux at the 95th Academy Awards, with Stephanie Hsu providing vocals in place of Mitski.

On July 20, 2023, the stage version of &quot;Here Lies Love&quot; made its Broadway debut. In the leadup to the premiere, Broadway&#x27;s musicians&#x27; union criticized the show for planning to use a pre-recorded soundtrack and no live musicians. Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians criticized this choice as &quot;A direct attack on Broadway Audiences — and live music.&quot; Statements from the creative team claiming that the decision was inspired by karaoke and that the show &quot;does not believe in artistic gate-keepers&quot; attracted further criticism from union members, who accused Byrne of &quot;denigrating&quot; and &quot;tossing aside&quot; live musicians and likened his remarks to union busting. Following this, the creative team for &quot;Here Lies Love&quot; announced that the show would employ twelve live musicians, including three actor-musicians.

==Other work==
David Byrne co-founded the world-music record label Luaka Bop with Yale Evelev in 1990. It was originally created to release Latin American compilations, but it has grown to include music from Cuba, Africa, the Far East and beyond, releasing the work of artists such as Cornershop, Os Mutantes, Los De Abajo, Jim White, Zap Mama, Tom Zé, Los Amigos Invisibles, and King Changó.

In 2005, he initiated his own internet radio station, Radio David Byrne. Each month, Byrne posts a playlist of music he likes, linked by themes or genres. Byrne&#x27;s playlists have included African popular music, country music classics, vox humana, classical opera and film scores from Italian movies.

He serves on the board of directors of SoundExchange, an organisation designated by the United States Congress to collect and distribute digital performance royalties for sound recordings.

In 2006, Byrne released &quot;Arboretum&quot;, a sketchbook facsimile of his Tree Drawings, published by McSweeney&#x27;s. Byrne is a visual artist whose work has been shown in contemporary art galleries and museums around since the 1990s. Represented by the Pace/MacGill Gallery in New York. In 2010 his original artwork was in the exhibition &quot;The Record: Contemporary Art and Vinyl&quot; at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University.

===TED Talks===
David Byrne has also been a speaker at the TED conferences. In June 2010, he spoke at the TED conference about the effects of architecture on music. Later in October 2010, he performed a hit from Talking Heads&#x27; 1988 album &quot;Naked&quot; titled &quot;(Nothing But) Flowers&quot; along with Thomas Dolby and string quartet Ethel-the TED2010 house band.

==Personal life==
Although a resident of the United States since childhood, Byrne was solely a British citizen until 2012, when he became a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States. He has also held Irish citizenship since 2020. Speaking of his Scottish origins in a 2014 interview with &quot;The Evening Standard&quot;, Byrne stated &quot;I have lived in the States pretty much my whole life, but from my parents and everything, there&#x27;s still an affinity to maybe a Scottish sense of humour, and some of the attitudes that go with that.&quot; During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Byrne expressed his preference for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom.

He lives in New York City. His father, Thomas, died in October 2013. His mother, Emma, died in June 2014.

Byrne describes himself as on the autism spectrum, but has not been professionally diagnosed. In a 2020 interview on Amy Schumer&#x27;s podcast &quot;3 Girls, 1 Keith&quot;, he said that he felt that his condition was a superpower as it allows him to hyperfocus on his creative pursuits. In 2012, he said that he felt that music was his way of communicating when he could not do it face to face because of his autism.

===Relationships===
Byrne had a brief relationship with Toni Basil in 1981 and he dated Twyla Tharp between 1981 and 1982. While visiting Japan in 1982, Byrne met costume designer Adelle Lutz, and they married in 1987. They have a daughter, Malu Abeni Valentine Byrne, born in 1989, and a grandson born in 2018. Byrne and Lutz divorced in 2004. After his divorce, he became romantically involved with the art curator and Gagosian Gallery sales director Louise Neri. He also had a relationship with the artist Cindy Sherman from 2007 to 2011.

===Cycling===
Byrne is known for his activism in support of increased cycling and for having used a bike as his main means of transport throughout his life, especially cycling around New York. In Los Angeles, Byrne drives a Citroën DS, but in New York, he does not drive a car.

He says that he began cycling while he was in high school and returned to it as an adult in the late 1970s. He likes the freedom and exhilaration cycling gives him. He has written widely on cycling, including a 2009 book, &quot;Bicycle Diaries&quot;. In August 2009, Byrne auctioned his Montague folding bike to raise money for the London Cycling Campaign.

In 2008, Byrne designed a series of bicycle parking racks in the form of image outlines corresponding to the areas in which they were located, such as a dollar sign for Wall Street and an electric guitar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Byrne worked with a manufacturer who constructed the racks in exchange for the right to sell them later as art. The racks remained on the streets for about a year.

Two bike racks constructed from the Byrne Bike Rack Alphabet, a system of modular letter segments that can be combined to form various words, remain installed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

He came to the 2023 Met Gala on a Budnitz single speed bike.

<text>Solipsism ( ; ) is the philosophical idea that only one&#x27;s mind is sure to exist. As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one&#x27;s own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind.

==Varieties==
There are varying degrees of solipsism that parallel the varying degrees of skepticism:

===Metaphysical===
Metaphysical solipsism is a variety of solipsism based on a philosophy of subjective idealism. Metaphysical solipsists maintain that the self is the only existing reality and that all other realities, including the external world and other persons, are representations of that self, having no independent existence. There are several versions of metaphysical solipsism, such as Caspar Hare&#x27;s egocentric presentism (or perspectival realism), in which other people are conscious, but their experiences are simply not &quot;present&quot;.

===Epistemological===
Epistemological solipsism is the variety of idealism according to which only the directly accessible mental contents of the solipsistic philosopher can be known. The existence of an external world is regarded as an unresolvable question rather than actually false. Further, one cannot also be certain as to what extent the external world exists independently of one&#x27;s mind. For instance, it may be that a God-like being controls the sensations received by the mind, making it appear as if there is an external world when most of it (excluding the God-like being and oneself) is false. However, the point remains that epistemological solipsists consider this an &quot;unresolvable&quot; question.

===Methodological===
Methodological solipsism is an agnostic variant of solipsism. It exists in opposition to the strict epistemological requirements for &quot;knowledge&quot; (&quot;e.g.&quot; the requirement that knowledge must be certain). It still entertains the points that any induction is fallible. Methodological solipsism sometimes goes even further to say that even what we perceive as the brain is actually part of the external world, for it is only through our senses that we can see or feel the mind. Only the existence of thoughts is known for certain.

Methodological solipsists do not intend to conclude that the stronger forms of solipsism are actually true. They simply emphasize that justifications of an external world must be founded on indisputable facts about their own consciousness. The methodological solipsist believes that subjective impressions (empiricism) or innate knowledge (rationalism) are the sole possible or proper starting point for philosophical construction. Often methodological solipsism is not held as a belief system, but rather used as a thought experiment to assist skepticism (&quot;e.g.&quot; René Descartes&#x27; Cartesian skepticism).

==Main points==
Mere denial of material existence, in itself, does not necessarily constitute solipsism.

Philosophers generally try to build knowledge on more than an inference or analogy. Well-known frameworks such as Descartes&#x27; epistemological enterprise brought to popularity the idea that all certain knowledge may go no further than &quot;&quot;I think; therefore I exist.&quot;&quot; However, Descartes&#x27; view does not provide any details about the nature of the &quot;I&quot; that has been proven to exist.

The theory of solipsism also merits close examination because it relates to three widely held philosophical presuppositions, each itself fundamental and wide-ranging in importance:

* One&#x27;s most certain knowledge is the content of one&#x27;s own mind—&quot;my&quot; thoughts, experiences, affects, etc.
* There is no conceptual or logically necessary link between mental and physical—between, for example, the occurrence of certain conscious experience or mental states and the &quot;possession&quot; and behavioral dispositions of a &quot;body&quot; of a particular kind.
* The experience of a given person is &quot;necessarily&quot; private to that person.

To expand on the second point, the conceptual problem is that the previous point assumes mind or consciousness (which are attributes) can exist independent of some entity having this attribute (a capability in this case), i.e., that an attribute of an existent can exist apart from the existent itself. If one admits to the existence of an independent entity (e.g., the brain) having that attribute, the door is open to an independent reality. (See Brain in a vat)

Some philosophers hold that, while it cannot be proven that anything independent of one&#x27;s mind exists, the point that solipsism makes is irrelevant. This is because, whether the world as we perceive it exists independently or not, we cannot escape this perception, hence it is best to act assuming that the world is independent of our minds.

==History==
Origins of solipsist thought are found in Greece and later Enlightenment thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and Descartes.

===Gorgias===
Solipsism was first recorded by the Greek presocratic sophist, Gorgias (–375 BC), who is quoted by the Roman sceptic Sextus Empiricus as having stated:

* Nothing exists.
* Even if something exists, nothing can be known about it.
* Even if something could be known about it, knowledge about it cannot be communicated to others.

Much of the point of the sophists was to show that objective knowledge was a literal impossibility.

===René Descartes===
The foundations of solipsism are in turn the foundations of the view that the individual&#x27;s understanding of any and all psychological concepts (thinking, willing, perceiving, etc.) is accomplished by making an analogy with their own mental states; &quot;i.e.&quot;, by abstraction from &quot;inner experience&quot;. And this view, or some variant of it, has been influential in philosophy since René Descartes elevated the search for incontrovertible certainty to the status of the &quot;primary goal&quot; of epistemology, whilst also elevating epistemology to &quot;first philosophy&quot;.

===Berkeley===
George Berkeley&#x27;s arguments against materialism in favour of idealism provide the solipsist with a number of arguments not found in Descartes. While Descartes defends ontological dualism, thus accepting the existence of a material world (&quot;res extensa&quot;) as well as immaterial minds (&quot;res cogitans&quot;) and God, Berkeley denies the existence of matter but not minds, of which God is one.

==Relation to other ideas==
===Idealism and materialism===
One of the most fundamental debates in philosophy concerns the &quot;true&quot; nature of the world—whether it is some ethereal plane of ideas or a reality of atomic particles and energy. Materialism posits a real &quot;world out there&quot;, as well as in and through us, that can be sensed—seen, heard, tasted, touched and felt, sometimes with prosthetic technologies corresponding to human sensing organs. (Materialists do not claim that human senses or even their prosthetics can, even when collected, sense the totality of the universe; simply that they collectively cannot sense what cannot in any way be known to us.) Materialists do not find this a useful way of thinking about the ontology and ontogeny of ideas, but we might say that from a materialist perspective pushed to a logical extreme communicable to an idealist, ideas are ultimately reducible to a physically communicated, organically, socially and environmentally embedded &#x27;brain state&#x27;. While reflexive existence is not considered by materialists to be experienced on the atomic level, the individual&#x27;s physical and mental experiences are ultimately reducible to the unique tripartite combination of environmentally determined, genetically determined, and randomly determined interactions of firing neurons and atomic collisions.

For materialists, ideas have no primary reality as essences separate from our physical existence. From a materialist perspective, ideas are social (rather than purely biological), and formed and transmitted and modified through the interactions between social organisms and their social and physical environments. This materialist perspective informs scientific methodology, insofar as that methodology assumes that humans have no access to omniscience and that therefore human knowledge is an ongoing, collective enterprise that is best produced via scientific and logical conventions adjusted specifically for material human capacities and limitations.

Modern idealists believe that the mind and its thoughts are the only true things that exist. This is the reverse of what is sometimes called &quot;classical idealism&quot; or, somewhat confusingly, &quot;Platonic idealism&quot; due to the influence of Plato&#x27;s theory of forms (εἶδος &quot;eidos&quot; or ἰδέα &quot;idea&quot;), which were not products of our thinking. The material world is ephemeral, but a perfect triangle or &quot;beauty&quot; is eternal. Religious thinking tends to be some form of idealism, as God usually becomes the highest ideal (such as neoplatonism). On this scale, solipsism can be classed as idealism. Thoughts and concepts are all that exist, and furthermore, only the solipsist&#x27;s own thoughts and consciousness exist. The so-called &quot;reality&quot; is nothing more than an idea that the solipsist has (perhaps unconsciously) created.

===Cartesian dualism===
There is another option: the belief that both ideals and &quot;reality&quot; exist. Dualists commonly argue that the distinction between the mind (or &#x27;ideas&#x27;) and matter can be proven by employing Leibniz&#x27;s principle of the &quot;identity of indiscernibles&quot;, which states that if two things share exactly the same qualities, then they must be identical, as in indistinguishable from each other and therefore one and the same thing. Dualists then attempt to identify attributes of mind that are lacked by matter (such as privacy or intentionality) or vice versa (such as having a certain temperature or electrical charge). One notable application of the identity of indiscernibles was by René Descartes in his &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;. Descartes concluded that he could not doubt the existence of &quot;himself&quot; (the famous &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot; argument), but that he &quot;could&quot; doubt the (separate) existence of &quot;his&quot; body. From this, he inferred that the &quot;person Descartes&quot; must not be identical to &quot;the Descartes body&quot; since one possessed a characteristic that the other did not: namely, it could be known to exist. Solipsism agrees with Descartes in this aspect, and goes further: only things that can be known to exist for sure should be considered to exist. &quot;The Descartes body&quot; could only exist as an idea in the mind of the &quot;person Descartes&quot;. Descartes and dualism aim to prove the actual existence of reality as opposed to a phantom existence (as well as the existence of God in Descartes&#x27; case), using the realm of ideas merely as a starting point, but solipsism usually finds those further arguments unconvincing. The solipsist instead proposes that their own unconscious is the author of all seemingly &quot;external&quot; events from &quot;reality&quot;.

===Philosophy of Schopenhauer===
&quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; is the central work of Arthur Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation, the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy as the relationship between human will and human body.

===Idealism===
The idealist philosopher George Berkeley argued that physical objects do not exist independently of the mind that perceives them. An item truly exists only as long as it is observed; otherwise, it is not only meaningless but simply nonexistent. Berkeley does attempt to show things can and do exist apart from the human mind and our perception, but only because there is an all-encompassing Mind in which all &quot;ideas&quot; are perceived – in other words, God, who observes all. Solipsism agrees that nothing exists outside of perception, but would argue that Berkeley falls prey to the egocentric predicament – he can only make his own observations, and thus cannot be truly sure that this God or other people exist to observe &quot;reality&quot;. The solipsist would say it is better to disregard the unreliable observations of alleged other people and rely upon the immediate certainty of one&#x27;s own perceptions.

===Rationalism===
Rationalism is the philosophical position that truth is best discovered by the use of reasoning and logic rather than by the use of the senses (see Plato&#x27;s theory of forms). Solipsism is also skeptical of sense-data.

===Philosophical zombie===
The theory of solipsism crosses over with the theory of the philosophical zombie in that other seemingly conscious beings may actually lack true consciousness, instead they only display traits of consciousness to the observer, who may be the only conscious being there is.

===Philosophy of identity===
Some philosophers have connected solipsistic ideas with the philosophy of personal identity, as well as Hellie&#x27;s vertiginous question. Christian List argues that the vertiginous question and the existence of first-person perspectives implies a &quot;quadrilemma&quot; of metaphysical theories of consciousness. He argues that at least one of the four following metaphysical claims must be false: &#x27;first-person realism&#x27;, &#x27;non-solipsism&#x27;, &#x27;non-fragmentation&#x27;, and &#x27;one world&#x27;. Caspar Hare has argued for a form of solipsism called egocentric presentism, in which other persons can be conscious, but their experiences are simply not .

===Philosophy of time===
In the paper &quot;The Personalized A-Theory of Time and Perspective&quot;, Vincent Conitzer connects A series and B series theories of time with the metaphysics of first-person perspectives. Conitzer argues that if A-theory is correct, and a given moment of time, i.e. the present, is metaphysically privileged, this implies that a given &quot;I&quot; is also metaphysically privileged in the same way. He argues that arguments for A-theory are more effective as arguments for the combined position of both A-theory and first-person realism, but that arguments for B-theory are ineffective against the combined position. Within Caspar Hare&#x27;s theory of perspectival realism, Hare points out that arguments in favor of a certain first-person perspective being metaphysically privileged are similar to the arguments made in favor of presentism. According to presentism, if Event A is happening on [insert today&#x27;s date], A is &quot;simply&quot; happening (right now), not relative to anything. It could be argued that this is similar to solipsism, in which Experience A is &quot;simply&quot; present, not relative to anything, as opposed to only being present &quot;to you&quot;.

===Falsifiability and testability===
Solipsism is not a falsifiable hypothesis as described by Karl Popper: there does not seem to be an imaginable disproof. According to Popper: a hypothesis that cannot be falsified is not scientific, and a solipsist can observe &quot;the success of sciences&quot; (see also no miracles argument). One critical test is nevertheless to consider the induction from experience that the externally observable world does not seem, at first approach, to be directly manipulable purely by mental energies alone. One can indirectly manipulate the world through the medium of the physical body, but it seems impossible to do so through pure thought (psychokinesis). It might be argued that if the external world were merely a construct of a single consciousness, &quot;i.e.&quot; the self, it could then follow that the external world should be somehow directly manipulable by that consciousness, and if it is not, then solipsism is false. An argument against this states that this argument is circular and incoherent. It assumes at the beginning a &quot;construct of a single consciousness&quot; meaning something false, and then tries to manipulate the external world that it just assumed was false. Of course this is an impossible task, but it does not disprove solipsism. It is simply poor reasoning when considering pure idealized logic and that is why David Deutsch states that when other scientific methods are used also, (not only logic), solipsism is &quot;indefensible&quot;, also when using the simplest explanations: 
&quot;If, according to the simplest explanation, an entity is complex and autonomous, then that entity is real.&quot;

The method of the typical scientist is naturalist: they first assume that the external world exists and can be known. But the scientific method, in the sense of a predict-observe-modify loop, does not require the assumption of an external world. A solipsist may perform a psychological test on themselves, to discern the nature of the reality in their mind – however Deutsch uses this fact to counter-argue: &quot;outer parts&quot; of solipsist, behave independently so they are independent for &quot;narrowly&quot; defined (&quot;conscious&quot;) self. A solipsist&#x27;s investigations may not be proper science however, since it would not include the co-operative and communitarian aspects of scientific inquiry that normally serve to diminish bias.

===Minimalism===
Solipsism is a form of logical minimalism. Many people are intuitively unconvinced of the nonexistence of the external world from the basic arguments of solipsism, but a solid proof of its existence is not available at present. The central assertion of solipsism rests on the nonexistence of such a proof, and strong solipsism (as opposed to weak solipsism) asserts that no such proof can be made. In this sense, solipsism is logically related to agnosticism in religion: the distinction between believing you do not know, and believing you could not have known.

However, minimality (or parsimony) is not the only logical virtue. A common misapprehension of Occam&#x27;s razor has it that the simpler theory is always the best. In fact, the principle is that the simpler of two theories of &quot;equal explanatory power&quot; is to be preferred. In other words: additional &quot;entities&quot; can pay their way with enhanced explanatory power. So the naturalist can claim that, while their world view is more complex, it is more satisfying as an explanation.

===In infants===
Some developmental psychologists believe that infants are solipsistic, and that eventually children infer that others have experiences much like theirs and reject solipsism.

===Hinduism===
The earliest reference to solipsism is found in the ideas in Hindu philosophy in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, dated to early 1st millennium BC. The Upanishad holds the mind to be the only god and all actions in the universe are thought to be a result of the mind assuming infinite forms. After the development of distinct schools of Indian philosophy, Advaita Vedanta and Samkhya schools are thought to have originated concepts similar to solipsism.

====Advaita Vedanta====
Advaita is one of the six most known Hindu philosophical systems and literally means &quot;non-duality&quot;. Its first great consolidator was Adi Shankaracharya, who continued the work of some of the Upanishadic teachers, and that of his teacher&#x27;s teacher Gaudapada. By using various arguments, such as the analysis of the three states of experience—wakefulness, dream, and deep sleep, he established the singular reality of Brahman, in which Brahman, the universe and the Atman or the Self, were one and the same.
The concept of the Self in the philosophy of Advaita could be interpreted as solipsism. However, the theological definition of the Self in Advaita protect it from true solipsism as found in the west. Similarly, the Vedantic text Yogavasistha, escapes charge of solipsism because the real &quot;I&quot; is thought to be nothing but the absolute whole looked at through a particular unique point of interest.

It is mentioned in Yoga Vasistha that “…..according to them (we can safely assume that them are present Solipsists) this world is mental in nature. There is no reality other than the ideas of one’s own mind. This view is incorrect, because the world cannot be the content of an individual’s mind. If it were so, an individual would have created and destroyed the world according to his whims. This theory is called atma khyati – the pervasion of the little self (intellect). Yoga Vasistha - Nirvana Prakarana - Uttarardha (Volume - 6) Page 107 by Swami Jyotirmayananda

====Samkhya and Yoga====
Samkhya philosophy, which is sometimes seen as the basis of Yogic thought, adopts a view that matter exists independently of individual minds. Representation of an object in an individual mind is held to be a mental approximation of the object in the external world. Therefore, Samkhya chooses representational realism over epistemological solipsism. Having established this distinction between the external world and the mind, Samkhya posits the existence of two metaphysical realities Prakriti (matter) and Purusha (consciousness).

===Buddhism===
Some philosophical tenets of Buddhism assert that external reality is an illusion, and can be understood as metaphysical solipsism, but most tenets of Buddhist philosophy, generally hold that the mind and external phenomena are both transient, and that they arise from each other. The mind cannot exist without external phenomena, nor can external phenomena exist without the mind. This relation is known as &quot;dependent arising&quot; (&quot;pratityasamutpada&quot;).

The Buddha stated, &quot;Within this fathom-long body is the world, the origin of the world, the cessation of the world, and the path leading to the cessation of the world.&quot; Whilst not rejecting the occurrence of external phenomena, the Buddha focused on the illusion created within the mind of the perceiver by the process of ascribing permanence to impermanent phenomena, satisfaction to unsatisfying experiences, and a sense of reality to things that were effectively insubstantial.

Mahayana Buddhism also challenges the illusion of the idea that one can experience an &#x27;objective&#x27; reality independent of individual perceiving minds.

From the standpoint of Prasangika (a branch of Madhyamaka thought), external objects do exist, but are devoid of any type of inherent identity: &quot;Just as objects of mind do not exist [inherently], mind also does not exist [inherently]&quot;. In other words, even though a chair may physically exist, individuals can only experience it through the medium of their own mind, each with their own literal point of view. Therefore, an independent, purely &#x27;objective&#x27; reality could never be experienced, and exist because of imputation of a name upon a phenomenon, though the phenomenon can function.

The Yogacara (sometimes translated as &quot;Mind only&quot;) school of Buddhist philosophy contends that all human experience is constructed by mind. Some later representatives of one Yogacara subschool (Prajñakaragupta, Ratnakīrti) propounded a form of idealism that has been interpreted as solipsism. A view of this sort is contained in the 11th-century treatise of Ratnakirti, &quot;Refutation of the existence of other minds&quot; (&quot;Santanantara dusana&quot;), which provides a philosophical refutation of external mind-streams from the Buddhist standpoint of ultimate truth (as distinct from the perspective of everyday reality).

In addition to this, the Bardo Thodol, Tibet&#x27;s famous book of the dead, repeatedly states that all of reality is a figment of one&#x27;s perception, although this occurs within the &quot;Bardo&quot; realm (post-mortem). For instance, within the sixth part of the section titled &quot;The Root Verses of the Six Bardos&quot;, there appears the following line: &quot;May I recognize whatever appeareth as being mine own thought-forms&quot;; there are many lines in similar ideal.

==Criticism==
Solipsism as radical subjective idealism has often been criticized by well-known philosophers (&quot;solipsism can only succeed in a madhouse&quot; — A. Schopenhauer, &quot;solipsism is madness&quot; — M. Gardner.)

Bertrand Russell wrote that it was &quot;psychologically impossible&quot; to believe, &quot;I once received a letter from an eminent logician, Mrs. Christine Ladd-Franklin, saying that she was a solipsist, and was surprised that there were no others. Coming from a logician and a solipsist, her surprise surprised me&quot;. He also argues that the logic of solipsism compels you to believe in &#x27;solipsism of the moment&#x27; where only the presently existing moment can be said to exist.

John Stuart Mill wrote that one can know of others&#x27; minds because &quot;First, they have bodies like me, which I know in my own case, to be the antecedent condition of feelings; and because, secondly, they exhibit the acts, and outward signs, which in my own case I know by experience to be caused by feelings&quot;.

<text>Mary-Kate Olsen (born June 13, 1986) is an American businesswoman, fashion designer, equestrian, and former actress. Her acting career began at the age of nine months, sharing the role of Michelle Tanner with her twin sister Ashley Olsen in the television sitcom &quot;Full House&quot; (1987–1995). They also starred in numerous films together.

In 1993, the production company Dualstar Entertainment Group was founded, which produced a long string of television films and direct-to-video releases featuring the girls; they starred in &quot;Passport to Paris&quot; (1999), &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; (2000), &quot;Winning London&quot; (2001), &quot;Holiday in the Sun&quot; (2001) and in the television series, &quot;So Little Time&quot; (2001–2002), for which she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in Children&#x27;s Programming. They starred in &quot;Getting There&quot; (2002), &quot;When in Rome&quot; (2002), &quot;The Challenge&quot; (2003) and made cameos in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003). The last film she starred in with her twin sister was &quot;New York Minute&quot; (2004). She continued with her acting career independently, appearing with a few guest-star roles in films and television shows, with her last film being &quot;Beastly&quot; (2011). 

In March 2012, both Mary-Kate and Ashley officially indicated their interest to retire as actresses in order to focus on their careers in the fashion industry. She and her twin sister co-founded luxury fashion brand The Row, lifestyle brand Elizabeth and James, and more affordable fashion lines Olsenboye and StyleMint. They are members of the Council of Fashion Designers of America.

==Early life and education==
Mary-Kate Olsen was born on June 13, 1986, in Sherman Oaks, California. She is the daughter of Jarnette &quot;Jarnie&quot; (née Jones; b. 1954), a personal manager, and David &quot;Dave&quot; Olsen, a real estate developer and mortgage banker. She is two minutes younger than her twin sister Ashley Olsen. She has an older brother Trent, a younger sister (actress Elizabeth Olsen), and two half-siblings Courtney and Jake (from her father&#x27;s second marriage). Olsen&#x27;s parents divorced in 1996. The twins and their siblings have Norwegian ancestry while their mother is of French, German and Italian ancestry.

Olsen attended the Campbell Hall School in Los Angeles. After graduating from Campbell Hall while she’s 18 in 2005, Olsen and her twin sister went on to attend the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at New York University.

==Acting career==
===Career beginnings===
Olsen began her acting career at the age of nine months old when she and Ashley were hired to share the role of Michelle Tanner on the popular television sitcom &quot;Full House&quot; (1987–1995). She starred alongside her twin sister in the films, &quot;To Grandmother&#x27;s House We Go&quot; (1992), &quot;Double, Double, Toil and Trouble&quot; (1993), &quot;How the West Was Fun&quot; (1994), &quot;It Takes Two&quot; (1995), &quot;Billboard Dad&quot; (1998) and in the television series, &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (1998–1999). In 1997, the Olsen twins guest starred in an episode of &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;, which starred twin actresses Tia Mowry and Tamera Mowry.

===Dualstar===

In 1993, following Mary-Kate and Ashley&#x27;s success on &quot;Full House&quot;, a limited liability company, Dualstar Entertainment Group was created to produce &quot;Mary-Kate and Ashley&quot;-branded products. It produced a successful long string of TV movies and direct-to-video releases featuring the girls. They starred in &quot;Passport to Paris&quot; (1999), &quot;Switching Goals&quot; (1999), &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; (2000), &quot;Winning London&quot; (2001), &quot;Holiday in the Sun&quot; (2001) and in the television series, &quot;So Little Time&quot; (2001–2002).

They became household names and popular figures in the preteen market during the late 1990s and early 2000s, with Mary-Kate&#x27;s likeness seen in clothes, books, fragrances, magazines, movies, and posters, among others. There were fashion dolls of her made by Mattel from 2000 to 2005. They also starred in the films &quot;Getting There&quot; (2002), &quot;When in Rome&quot; (2002), &quot;The Challenge&quot; (2003) and made cameos in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003). In 2004, the twins appeared in their final and light-hearted romantic comedy film, &quot;New York Minute&quot;.

That same year upon their 18th birthday, both Mary-Kate and Ashley took control of Dualstar, becoming joint-CEOs and presidents of the company, which at the time had its merchandise being carried in over 3,000 stores in America and 5,300 stores worldwide.

These ventures, combined with an array of licensing deals for their names and likenesses, made Olsen wealthy at a young age. In 2004, Olsen&#x27;s and her twin sister’s wealth was estimated at $137 million each.

===Retirement===
Olsen&#x27;s first solo acting appearance was in the movie &quot;Factory Girl&quot; (2006). Her one short scene was ultimately cut from theatrical release, but was included on the film&#x27;s Unrated version on DVD and Blu-ray.

In 2007, she had a recurring role on the television show, &quot;Weeds&quot;, and the twins said that if they became involved in movies together again, it would be as producers.

In 2008, Olsen made a guest appearance on the ABC comedy &quot;Samantha Who?&quot; as a self-destructive girl that Samantha tries to help. That same year, she also appeared in the film &quot;The Wackness&quot;. In 2011, Olsen appeared in the motion picture adaption of the Alex Flinn novel &quot;Beastly&quot;, which was her final acting project.

In March 2012, both Mary-Kate and Ashley indicated their interest to retire as actresses in order to focus on their careers in fashion. They discussed wanting to open a store as one of their future fashion-based endeavors.

In 2015, it was announced that John Stamos signed on with Netflix to produce and co-star in &quot;Fuller House&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Full House&quot; that would reunite the original cast members for a 13-episode series. However, in May of that year, Mary-Kate and Ashley announced that they would not reprise their role as Michelle Tanner. A month prior to the announcement, Nickelodeon acquired the rights to the twins&#x27; video library.

===Net worth and influence===
In 2007, Forbes ranked the twins jointly as the eleventh-richest women in entertainment, with an estimated combined net worth of $100 million.

==Fashion career==
===Career beginnings===
Following a high volume of public interest in their fashion choices, the Olsen twins began work in collaboration on a string of fashion lines available to the public. Starting as young girls, they started a clothing line in Wal-Mart stores across America for girls ages 4 to 14 as well as a beauty line called &quot;Mary-Kate and Ashley: Real fashion for real girls&quot;.

In 2004, they made news by signing a pledge to allow all the workers that sew their line of clothing in Bangladesh full maternity leave. The National Labor Committee, which organized the pledge, later praised the twins for their commitment to worker rights.
===Business===
As adults, the Olsen twins have devoted much of their attention to the world of fashion. They head a designer fashion label, The Row, as well as &quot;Elizabeth and James&quot;, &quot;Olsenboye&quot;, and &quot;StyleMint&quot; retail collections. The idea for The Row started as a personal project in 2005 when Ashley challenged herself to create a perfect T-shirt. She tested the design on a variety of women of all body shapes and ages in an attempt to find a &quot;commonality in fit and attitude.&quot; In 2013, they released an Elizabeth and James perfume.

In 2006, Mary-Kate and Ashley were tapped as the faces of the upscale fashion line Badgley Mischka. In 2008, they co-authored &quot;Influence&quot;, a book featuring interviews with fashion designers that have inspired the twins&#x27; fashion lines.

In 2011, Mary-Kate and Ashley collaborated with TOMS Shoes to design footwear for kids without shoes in more than 20 countries worldwide. That same year, the sisters designed an Olsenboye Change Purse and donated the money to &quot;Pennies From Heaven&quot;.

In October 2012, the twins won the &quot;WSJ&quot; magazine Innovator of The Year Award.

Mary-Kate&#x27;s controversial fashion choices have often found her on both the best and worst dressed fashion lists, particularly for her decision to wear fur. She and Ashley are members of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, CFDA a not-for-profit trade association of over 450 prominent American fashion and accessory designers. The twins are now the creative directors for Superga.

==Equestrian career==
Olsen began horse riding in 1992 when she was six years old. During her time at Campbell Hall, she was a member of the school&#x27;s equestrian team. After moving to New York in 2004 to attend NYU, Olsen temporarily quit riding, but she eventually started again, stating &quot;I came back to the sport because I missed it every day that I wasn&#x27;t riding. It was the hardest thing to leave and the hardest thing to come back to.&quot; In 2013, her horse Marvelous, ridden by James Anderson, won the 38th Hampton Classic Horse Show.

Olsen is a competitive equestrian. She began riding in the Hampton Classic Horse Show in Bridgehampton, New York in 2013. On September 17, 2016, she competed at The American Gold Cup in North Salem, New York. In August–September 2017, she competed at the Hampton Classic Horse Show: on August 29, Olsen and her horse Dunotaire V (born Dunotaire VI) finished in sixth place in the amateur owner jumper (1.20 meter) event; and on September 1, she and Dunotaire V finished in third place in the amateur owner jumper classic event. In September 2017, Olsen and her horse Feu d&#x27;Amour won The American Gold Cup. She also has horses named Prem&#x27; Dollar Boy and Hertog Van&#x27;t Merdehof.

In 2018, Olsen and Dunotaire V ranked 7 out of 40 in a category at the Palm Beach Masters in Wellington, Florida. In May 2019, Olsen competed at the Longines Global Champions Tour in Madrid, Spain; she and her horse Naomi finished in sixth place in their event, while she and her horse Fatum were disqualified from their event due to an &quot;error of course&quot;. On July 12, 2019, Olsen and Fatum won a 1.25m two-phase showjumping class at the Longines Global Champions Tour in Chantilly, France. In September 2021, she competed at the Longines Global Champions Tour in Rome, Italy: on September 16, she and her horse Iowa Van Het Polderhof finished in second place in the 2 Phases Special event; and on September 18, Olsen and Dunotaire V finished in third place in an Against the Clock No Jump Off event.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Olsen has dated David Katzenberg (son of DreamWorks cofounder Jeffrey Katzenberg), photographer Maxwell Snow, and artist Nate Lowman.

In May 2012, Olsen began a relationship with Olivier Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa, half-brother of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. In March 2014, photos were published showing Olsen wearing what appeared to be an engagement ring. Olsen and Sarkozy were married on November 27, 2015, at a private residence in New York City. On April 17, 2020, Olsen filed for divorce from Sarkozy. On May 13, she filed an emergency order to proceed despite delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the emergency order was denied a day later. On January 25, 2021, the divorce was finalized.

===Health issues===
In 2004, shortly after graduating from high school, Olsen announced she had entered treatment for anorexia nervosa. A Got Milk? advertisement featuring the twins was pulled following the announcement. On November 20, 2007, she was hospitalized for a reported kidney infection.

===Death of Heath Ledger===
Olsen was a close friend of actor Heath Ledger. After discovering Ledger dead in his bed on January 22, 2008, his massage therapist called Olsen twice before contacting police. Olsen sent a private security guard to the scene.

Responding to a claim by an anonymous law enforcement official that she would not speak to federal investigators without a promise of legal immunity, Olsen&#x27;s attorney Michael C. Miller said, &quot;We have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding Mr. Ledger&#x27;s death and the fact that Ms. Olsen does not know the source of the drugs Mr. Ledger consumed&quot;.

<text>Aksel Schiøtz (1 September 190619 April 1975) was a Danish tenor and later baritone, who was considered one of Europe&#x27;s leading lieder singers of the post-World War II period.

== Biography ==

Schiøtz was born in Roskilde, Denmark, but grew up in Hellerup near Copenhagen. He studied singing with John Forsell. Having obtained an M.A. in Danish and English in 1930, he taught at various schools in Roskilde and Copenhagen until 1938, when he gave up teaching. In October 1936, he gave his first lieder recital, and he made his opera début at the Royal Danish Theatre, Copenhagen, in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; in 1939. In 1940, he made a legendary recording of the tenor aria from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;.

In 1946, he underwent an operation for tumor acousticus. In &quot;Our Schubert&quot;, David Schroeder writes that the surgery &quot;should have put an end to his career in 1945, since it left him paralyzed on one side of his face and neck; but with the encouragement of friends and loved ones he relearned how to sing, becoming a baritone instead of a tenor.&quot; His wife Gerd particularly motivated him.

At the Glyndebourne Festival in 1946, he alternated with Peter Pears in the part of &#x27;Male Chorus&#x27; in Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of Lucretia.&quot; More than as an opera singer, however, Schiøtz is remembered for his interpretation of Danish songs and Schubert&#x27;s and Schumann&#x27;s lieder, as well as songs by Carl Michael Bellman. During the Nazi occupation of Denmark (1940–1945), he achieved great popularity for his recording of traditional Danish songs of the 19th and early 20th centuries. During the occupation there was a strong rise in Danish nationalism. Aksel Schiøtz&#x27;s lyrical and sensitive interpretation of Danish songs and his perfect command of the Danish language resulted in an everlasting gift to the Danish people.

From 1955 to 1958 he served as professor of music at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, later in Toronto by invitation of Boyd Neel, and finally at the University of Colorado, Boulder. From 1968 he was professor in Copenhagen. After retiring, he wrote &quot;The Singer and His Art&quot; (Hamish Hamilton, 1971).

Schiøtz died in Copenhagen in 1975, aged 68, and is buried in the churchyard of the Raabjerg Church, near Skiveren, Denmark, with his wife Gerd.

<doc id="81803" wikidata="Q2447078" url="?curid=81803" title="Alien invasion">
<text>Alien invasion or space invasion is a common feature in science fiction stories and films, in which extraterrestrial lifeforms invade Earth to exterminate and supplant human life, enslave it, harvest people for food, steal the planet&#x27;s resources, or destroy the planet altogether. It can be considered as a science-fiction subgenre of the invasion literature, expanded by H. G. Wells&#x27;s seminal alien invasion novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, and is a type of &#x27;first contact&#x27; science fiction.

Experts consider the prospects of an actual invasion of Earth by extraterrestrials to be extremely unlikely, due to the enormous cost in time and resources.

==Origins==
In 1898, Wells published &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, depicting the invasion of Victorian England by Martians equipped with advanced weaponry. It is now seen as the seminal alien invasion story and Wells is credited with establishing several extraterrestrial themes which were later greatly expanded by science fiction writers in the 20th century, including first contact and war between planets and their differing species. However, there were earlier published stories of aliens and alien invasion, such as the 1892 novel &quot;The Germ Growers&quot; by Australian clergyman Robert Potter, which describes a covert invasion by aliens who take on the appearance of human beings and attempt to develop a virulent disease to assist in their plans for global conquest. Potter&#x27;s novel was not widely read.

Wells had already proposed another outcome for the alien invasion story in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. When the Narrator meets the artilleryman the second time, the artilleryman imagines a future where humanity, hiding underground in sewers and tunnels, conducts a guerrilla war, fighting against the Martians for generations to come, and eventually, after learning how to duplicate Martian weapon technology, destroys the invaders and takes back the Earth.

Six weeks after publication of the novel, &quot;The Boston Post&quot; newspaper published another alien invasion story, an unauthorized sequel to &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, which turned the tables on the invaders. &quot;Edison&#x27;s Conquest of Mars&quot; was written by Garrett P. Serviss, who described the famous inventor Thomas Edison leading a counterattack against the invaders on their home soil. Though this is actually a sequel to &quot;Fighters from Mars&quot;, a revised and unauthorised reprint of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, they both were first printed in &quot;The Boston Post&quot; in 1898.

&quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; was reprinted in the United States in 1927, a year after the Golden Age of Science Fiction was created by Hugo Gernsback in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. John W. Campbell, another key editor of the era, and periodic short story writer, published several alien invasion stories in the 1930s. Many well-known science fiction writers were to follow, including Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Clifford D. Simak, plus Robert A. Heinlein who wrote &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot; in 1951.

==Variations==
===Alien infiltration===
This is a familiar variation on the alien invasion theme. In the infiltration scenario, the invaders will typically take human form and can move freely throughout human society, even to the point of taking control of command positions. The purpose of this may either be to take over the entire world through infiltration (&quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;), or as advanced scouts meant to &quot;soften up&quot; Earth in preparation for a full-scale invasion by the aliens&#x27; conventional military (&quot;First Wave&quot;). This type of invasion represented common fears of the American public during the Cold War, particularly the fear of infiltration by communist agents. The Reptilian conspiracy theory claims that covert alien infiltration is already happening.

===Beneficial alien invasion===

This theme has also been explored in fiction on the rare occasion. With this type of story, the invaders, in a kind of little grey/green man&#x27;s burden, colonize the planet in an effort to spread their culture and &quot;civilize&quot; the indigenous &quot;barbaric&quot; inhabitants or secretly watch and aid earthlings saving them from themselves. The former theme shares many traits with hostile occupation fiction, but the invaders tend to view the occupied peoples as students or equals rather than subjects and slaves. The latter theme of secret watcher is a paternalistic/maternalistic theme. In this fiction, the aliens intervene in human affairs to prevent them from destroying themselves, such as Klaatu and Gort in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; warning the leaders of Earth to abandon their warlike ways and join other space-faring civilizations else that they will destroy themselves or be destroyed by their interstellar union. Other examples of a beneficial alien invasion are Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s movie &quot;The Questor Tapes&quot; (1974) and his &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;&quot; (1968); Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;, the novel (later anime) series &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot;, the film &quot;Arrival&quot; (2016), and David Brin&#x27;s Uplift Universe series of books.

=== Invasion by humans ===
A similar trope depicts humans in the role of the &quot;alien&quot; invaders, where humans are the ones invading or attacking extraterrestrial lifeforms. Examples include the short story &quot;Sentry&quot; (1954) (in which the &quot;aliens&quot; described are, at the end, explained to be humans), the video game &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; (1989), &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; by Ray Bradbury, the Imperium of Man in the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe, &quot;Invaders from Earth&quot; by Robert Silverberg, &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; by Orson Scott Card, and the movies &quot;Battle for Terra&quot; (2007), &quot;Planet 51&quot; (2009), and &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009).

== Feasibility ==
Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) believes an alien invasion of Earth to be unlikely for several reasons. He believes that any resources available on Earth can be found on their home planet, or that it would be easier to locate or create it on their own. He also believes that, if alien life were to make contact with Earth, it would first be through robots rather than the aliens themselves. David Morrison, Director of Space at NASA-Ames Research Center argues that first contact would be in the form of radio communication rather than visitation.

<text>Babel-17 is a 1966 science fiction novel by American writer Samuel R. Delany in which the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis (that language influences thought and perception) plays an important part. It was joint winner of the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1967 (with &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;) and was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1967.

Delany hoped to have &quot;Babel-17&quot; originally published as a single volume with the novella &quot;Empire Star&quot;, but this did not happen until a 2001 reprint.

==Plot summary==
Babel-17 is a language that can be used as a weapon by enemy invaders during an interstellar war. Chinese starship captain, linguist, poet, and telepath Rydra Wong begins to learn the language. After several attacks have been made by the invaders who speak Babel-17, she soon realizes the potential of the language to change one&#x27;s thought process and provide speakers with certain powers, and she is recruited by her government to discover how the enemy is infiltrating and sabotaging strategic sites. As her understanding of the language increases, she is able to predict where the next attack will be and gathers a team to go to the predicted location of the attack. 

Initially Babel-17 is thought to be a code used by enemy agents. Rydra realizes it is a language in and of itself. During their mission, Rydra realizes there is a traitor aboard the ship. After escaping the predicted attack, Rydra and her crew are captured by a pirate ship called a shadow-ship. While on the ship, Rydra meets a man called &quot;The Butcher&quot; who does not use the word &quot;I&quot;. After teaching The Butcher the word &quot;I,&quot; Rydra, The Butcher, and her crew leave the ship during a battle. Rydra and The Butcher, who already unknowingly spoke Babel-17, are rescued but seem incredibly altered. While their bodies are present, their minds seem elsewhere. Their ability to speak Babel-17 has altered their minds and we learn that it was Rydra who was the traitor on board the ship. Babel-17 is discovered to be a language that not only helps you understand the enemy, but become the enemy.

The novel deals with several issues related to the peculiarities of language, how conditions of life shape the formation of words and meaning, and how words themselves can shape the actions of people.

==Influence==
Delany&#x27;s novel influenced a generation of writers: &quot;Native Tongue&quot; by Suzette Haden Elgin, &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; by Ursula K. Le Guin, &quot;Embassytown&quot; by China Miéville, &quot;In Luna Bore Coda&quot; by Joshua Nilles, and, more evidently, the short story &quot;Story of Your Life&quot; by Ted Chiang. Language as a weapon was adapted as a plot device in Neal Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Snow Crash&quot;. It also resembles a few preceding science fiction novels which deal with how languages shape the political and cultural stratum of societies, such as &quot;The Languages of Pao&quot; by Jack Vance or &quot;Anthem&quot; by Ayn Rand.

== Language of Babel-17 ==
The language portrayed at the center of &quot;Babel-17&quot; contains interesting linguistic features including the absence of a pronoun or any other construction for &quot;I&quot;. The heroine finds her perceptions (and even her physical abilities) altered once she has learned Babel-17. Babel-17 also seems to alter the worldview of those who speak it. When Rydra speaks in Babel-17, time slows down because she is able to communicate with much more precision. The language also not only allows one to express ideas much quicker but seems to also change one&#x27;s worldview. 

Delany describes himself as having been &quot;a die-hard believer in the Sapir-Whorf&quot;, which was in the air at the time, without his ever having heard the term; eventually, once he read about it, he decided that &quot;it was just incorrect&quot;, because &quot;it fails to take into account the whole economy of discourse, which is a linguistic level that accomplishes lots of the soft-edge conceptual contouring around ideas, whether we have available a one- or two-word name for it or only a set of informal many-word descriptions that are not completely fixed&quot;, which motivated his later works considering language: &quot;The realization of the flaws in the Sapir-Whorf, in that they caused me to begin considering the more complex linguistic mechanisms of discourse, you might say gave me my lifetime project.&quot;

==Other media==
In 2014, the work &quot;Babel-17&quot; was told in tandem with a partial biography of Samuel R. Delany&#x27;s early years in the form of a play &quot;The Motion of Light in Water&quot;, based on a 1988 autobiography with the same title, produced by Elbow Room, an Australian theatre company directed by Marcel Dorney.

Rush drummer and lyricist Neil Peart noted that &quot;Babel-17&quot; was one of his early literary influences, and was an important part of the crafting of the band&#x27;s hugely successful &quot;2112&quot; album.

<doc id="81816" wikidata="Q1809069" url="?curid=81816" title="The Languages of Pao">
<text>The Languages of Pao is a science fiction novel by American writer Jack Vance, first published in 1958, based on the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, which asserts that a language&#x27;s structure and grammar construct the perception and consciousness of its speakers. In the novel, the placid people from the planet Pao rely on other planets for technological innovations and manufactured goods and they do not resist when an invading force occupies the land and levies heavy taxes. To expel the aggressors and make the planet more independent, three new languages are introduced. A scientific language induces its speakers to innovate more; a well-ordered language encourages its speakers to be industrious; and a warlike language induces competitiveness and aggression. The new languages change the culture and Pao ousts their overlords and develops a sophisticated modern economy.

A shorter version was published in &quot;Satellite Science Fiction&quot; in late 1957. After the Avalon Books hardcover appeared the next year, it was reprinted in paperback by Ace Books in 1966 and reissued in 1968 and 1974. Additional hardcover and paperback reprints have followed, as well as British, French and Italian editions.

==Plot summary==
The planet Pao is a quiet backwater with a large, homogeneous, stolid population ruled by an absolute monarch: the Panarch. Pao&#x27;s cultural homogeneity contributes to making it vulnerable to external military and economic pressures. The current Panarch attempts to hire an offworld scientist, Lord Palafox from the Breakness Institute on the planet Breakness, as a consultant in order to reform Pao. Before the deal can be concluded, however, the Panarch is assassinated by his brother Bustamonte, using mind-control over the Panarch&#x27;s own son, Beran Panasper, to do so. Lord Palafox saves Beran Panasper and takes him to Breakness as a possible bargaining chip in his dealings with Pao.

Somewhat later, the predatory Brumbo Clan from the planet Batmarsh raids the virtually defenseless Pao with impunity, and the Panarch Bustamonte is forced to pay heavy tribute. To rid himself of the Brumbos, he seeks the aid of Palafox, who has a plan to create warrior, technical and mercantile castes on Pao using customized languages (named Valiant, Technicant and Cogitant) and other means to shape the mindsets of each caste, isolating them from each other and the general populace of Pao. To achieve this, each caste gets a special training area where it is completely segregated from any outside influence; the necessary land is confiscated from families, some of which have held it for countless generations — which creates some disaffection in the conservative Paonese population and earns Bustamonte the name of a tyrant.

In order to return with them to Pao incognito, Beran Panasper infiltrates a corps of interpreters being trained on Breakness. Mostly to amuse themselves, some of the young people create a language they call &quot;Pastiche&quot;, mixing words and grammatical forms, seemingly at random, from the three newly created languages and from the original Paonese language. Palafox looks upon this development with indulgence, failing to realize the tremendous long-term significance.

Beran returns to Pao under the name Ercolo Paraio and works for a few years as a translator at several locations. Once Beran Panasper reveals to the masses that he is still alive, his uncle Bustamonte&#x27;s popular support melts virtually overnight and Panasper claims the title of Panarch that is rightfully his. The Brumbo Clan is repulsed by the warrior caste. For a few years, the castes of Pao are highly successful in their respective endeavors and the planet experiences a short golden age. However, Panasper is upset about the divisions in the populace of Pao caused by the Palafox program; the three new castes speak of the rest of the Paonese as &quot;they&quot; rather than &quot;we&quot; and regard them with contempt.

Beran attempts to return the planet to its previous state by re-integrating the castes into the general populace. Palafox opposes this move and is killed, but the warrior caste stages a coup and takes command of Pao. Panasper convinces them that they cannot rule the planet alone, since they share no common language with the rest of the population and cannot rely on the cooperation of the other segments of the people of Pao, and they allow him to keep his office.

One interpretation of the end of the novel is that Beran Panasper is only in nominal charge of the planet, on the sufferance of the warrior caste, and that it is uncertain what will become of him and his plans of re-uniting the populace of Pao. Another way of seeing the ending is that Beran has outfoxed the warriors by getting them to agree to his decree that &quot;every child of Pao, of whatever caste, must learn Pastiche even in preference to the language of his father&quot;. In the end, Beran looks ahead twenty years, to a future when all inhabitants of Pao will be Pastiche-speakers — i.e., will speak a language which mixes some attributes and mindsets appropriate to peasant cultivators, proud warriors, skilled technicians and smart merchants — which will presumably shape a highly fluid and socially mobile society, composed of versatile and multi-skilled individuals.

==Reception==
Frederik Pohl reported that Vance had &quot;pretty carefully&quot; worked out his extrapolation, but that &quot;it isn&#x27;t terribly convincing as presented&quot;. Pohl also noted that &quot;Vance writes well -- sometimes even brilliantly&quot;, but that his prose sometimes seemed uneven and artificial. Floyd C. Gale called the novel &quot;a good idea well handled&quot;. David Langford cited Vance&#x27;s &quot;engaging speculation&quot;, but concluded that the protagonist &quot;seems too weak a character for his leading role&quot;, while &quot;the culture and landscape of Pao are grey and ill-defined, in strong contrast to the exotically colourful societies and ecologies which became Vance&#x27;s trademark&quot;.

==Sapir–Whorf hypothesis==
In linguistics, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis asserts that a language&#x27;s structure and grammar construct the perception and consciousness of its speakers.

This novel centers on a fictional experiment in molding a civilization by designing its language. As the mastermind behind this experiment, Lord Palafox, says in chapter 9: &quot;We must alter the mental framework of the Paonese people, which is most easily achieved by altering the language.&quot; His son, Finisterle, says in chapter 11 to a class of linguists in training: &quot;every language impresses a certain world-view upon the mind.&quot;

==Euphemisms==
Vance uses some unusual euphemisms in this book.
* &quot;subaqueation&quot; for &quot;drowning&quot;, the traditional method of execution on Pao
* &quot;neutraloids&quot; for &quot;eunuchs&quot;, the physically enhanced but castrated guards of the Panarch

<doc id="81818" wikidata="Q187223" url="?curid=81818" title="Lagoon">
<text>A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by a narrow landform, such as reefs, barrier islands, barrier peninsulas, or isthmuses. Lagoons are commonly divided into &quot;coastal lagoons&quot; (or &quot;barrier lagoons&quot;) and &quot;atoll lagoons&quot;. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world.

==Definition and terminology==
Lagoons are shallow, often elongated bodies of water separated from a larger body of water by a shallow or exposed shoal, coral reef, or similar feature. Some authorities include fresh water bodies in the definition of &quot;lagoon&quot;, while others explicitly restrict &quot;lagoon&quot; to bodies of water with some degree of salinity. The distinction between &quot;lagoon&quot; and &quot;estuary&quot; also varies between authorities. Richard A. Davis Jr. restricts &quot;lagoon&quot; to bodies of water with little or no fresh water inflow, and little or no tidal flow, and calls any bay that receives a regular flow of fresh water an &quot;estuary&quot;. Davis does state that the terms &quot;lagoon&quot; and &quot;estuary&quot; are &quot;often loosely applied, even in scientific literature&quot;. Timothy M. Kusky characterizes lagoons as normally being elongated parallel to the coast, while estuaries are usually drowned river valleys, elongated perpendicular to the coast. Coastal lagoons are classified as inland bodies of water.

When used within the context of a distinctive portion of coral reef ecosystems, the term &quot;lagoon&quot; is synonymous with the term &quot;back reef&quot; or &quot;backreef&quot;, which is more commonly used by coral reef scientists to refer to the same area.

Many lagoons do not include &quot;lagoon&quot; in their common names. Currituck, Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds in North Carolina, Great South Bay between Long Island and the barrier beaches of Fire Island in New York, Isle of Wight Bay, which separates Ocean City, Maryland from the rest of Worcester County, Maryland, Banana River in Florida, US, Lake Illawarra in New South Wales, Australia, Montrose Basin in Scotland, and Broad Water in Wales have all been classified as lagoons, despite their names. In England, The Fleet at Chesil Beach has also been described as a lagoon.

In some languages the word for a lagoon is simply a type of lake: In Chinese a lake is &#x27; (), and a lagoon is &#x27; (). In the French Mediterranean several lagoons are called &quot;étang&quot; (&quot;lake&quot;). Contrariwise, several other languages have specific words for such bodies of water. In Spanish, coastal lagoons generically are &#x27;, but those on the Mediterranean coast are specifically called &#x27;. In Russian and Ukrainian, those on the Black Sea are &#x27; (), while the generic word is &#x27; (). Similarly, in the Baltic, Danish has the specific &#x27;, and German the specifics &#x27; and &quot;Haff&quot;, as well as generic terms derived from &#x27;. In Poland these lagoons are called &quot;zalew&quot; (&quot;bay&quot;), and in Lithuania &quot;marios&quot; (&quot;lagoon, reservoir&quot;). In Jutland several lagoons are known as &quot;fjord&quot;. In New Zealand the Māori word &#x27; refers to a coastal lagoon formed at the mouth of a braided river where there are mixed sand and gravel beaches, while , an ephemeral coastal waterbody, is neither a true lagoon, lake, nor estuary.

Some languages differentiate between coastal and atoll lagoons. In French, &quot;&quot; refers specifically to an atoll lagoon, while coastal lagoons are described as , the generic word for a still lake or pond.
In Vietnamese, &#x27; refers to an atoll lagoon, whilst &#x27; is coastal.

In Latin America, the term &#x27; in Spanish, which lagoon translates to, may be used for a small fresh water lake in a similar way a creek is considered a small river. However, sometimes it is popularly used to describe a full-sized lake, such as Laguna Catemaco in Mexico, which is actually the third-largest lake by area in the country. The brackish water lagoon may be thus explicitly identified as a &quot;coastal lagoon&quot; (&#x27;). In Portuguese, a similar usage is found: &quot; may be a body of shallow seawater, or a small freshwater lake not linked to the sea.

===Etymology===
Lagoon is derived from the Italian &quot;, which refers to the waters around Venice, the Venetian Lagoon. &quot;Laguna&quot; is attested in English by at least 1612, and had been Anglicized to &quot;lagune&quot; by 1673. In 1697 William Dampier referred to a &quot;Lagune or Lake of Salt water&quot; on the coast of Mexico. Captain James Cook described an island &quot;of Oval form with a Lagoon in the middle&quot; in 1769.

==Atoll lagoons==
Atoll lagoons form as coral reefs grow upwards while the islands that the reefs surround subside, until eventually only the reefs remain above sea level. Unlike the lagoons that form shoreward of fringing reefs, atoll lagoons often contain some deep (&gt;) portions.

==Coastal lagoons==

Coastal lagoons form along gently sloping coasts where barrier islands or reefs can develop offshore, and the sea-level is rising relative to the land along the shore (either because of an intrinsic rise in sea-level, or subsidence of the land along the coast). Coastal lagoons do not form along steep or rocky coasts, or if the range of tides is more than . Due to the gentle slope of the coast, coastal lagoons are shallow. A relative drop in sea level may leave a lagoon largely dry, while a rise in sea level may let the sea breach or destroy barrier islands, and leave reefs too deep underwater to protect the lagoon. Coastal lagoons are young and dynamic, and may be short-lived in geological terms. Coastal lagoons are common, occurring along nearly 15 percent of the world&#x27;s shorelines. In the United States, lagoons are found along more than 75 percent of the Eastern and Gulf Coasts.

Coastal lagoons can be classified as leaky, restricted, or choked.
Coastal lagoons are usually connected to the open ocean by inlets between barrier islands. The number and size of the inlets, precipitation, evaporation, and inflow of fresh water all affect the nature of the lagoon. Lagoons with little or no interchange with the open ocean, little or no inflow of fresh water, and high evaporation rates, such as Lake St. Lucia, in South Africa, may become highly saline. Lagoons with no connection to the open ocean and significant inflow of fresh water, such as the Lake Worth Lagoon in Florida in the middle of the 19th century, may be entirely fresh. On the other hand, lagoons with many wide inlets, such as the Wadden Sea, have strong tidal currents and mixing. Coastal lagoons tend to accumulate sediments from inflowing rivers, from runoff from the shores of the lagoon, and from sediment carried into the lagoon through inlets by the tide. Large quantities of sediment may be occasionally be deposited in a lagoon when storm waves overwash barrier islands. Mangroves and marsh plants can facilitate the accumulation of sediment in a lagoon. Benthic organisms may stabilize or destabilize sediments.

<text>John Guilbert Avildsen (December 21, 1935 – June 16, 2017) was an American film director.

He is best known for directing &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), which earned him the Academy Award for Best Director. He is also renowned for directing the first three films in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; franchise (1984–1989). Other films he directed include &quot;Joe&quot; (1970), &quot;Save the Tiger&quot; (1973), &quot;The Formula&quot; (1980), &quot;Neighbors&quot; (1981), &quot;Lean on Me&quot; (1989), &quot;Rocky V&quot; (1990), &quot;8 Seconds&quot; (1994), and &quot;Inferno&quot; (1999).

==Early life==
Avildsen was born in Oak Park, Illinois, the son of Ivy (&quot;née&quot; Guilbert) and Clarence John Avildsen. He was educated at Indian Mountain School, the Hotchkiss School and at New York University.

==Career==
After starting out as an assistant director on films by Arthur Penn and Otto Preminger and acting as director of photography on the 1969 film, &quot;Out of It&quot;, Avildsen&#x27;s early low-budget feature &quot;Joe&quot; (1970) received good notices for star Peter Boyle and was a big box-office hit grossing nearly $20 million on a $100,000 budget. Avildsen followed this early success with the low-budget 1971 cult classic comedy film &quot;Cry Uncle!&quot; (released in the UK as &quot;Superdick&quot; and on video as &quot;American Oddballs&quot;), a 1971 American film in the Troma Entertainment library that stars Allen Garfield. This was followed by &quot;Save the Tiger&quot; (1973), a film nominated for three Oscars, winning Best Actor for star Jack Lemmon.

His greatest success came with &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), which he directed working in conjunction with writer and star Sylvester Stallone. The film was a major critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1976 and garnering ten Academy Award nominations and winning three, including Best Picture and Best Director. Avildsen later returned to direct what was then expected to be the series&#x27; final installment, &quot;Rocky V&quot; (1990).

He directed the mystery-drama &quot;The Formula&quot; (1980), starring Marlon Brando and George C. Scott, for which he was nominated for Razzie Award for Worst Director.

Avildsen&#x27;s other films include &quot;Neighbors&quot; (1981), &quot;For Keeps&quot; (1988), &quot;Lean on Me&quot; (1989), &quot;The Power of One&quot; (1992), &quot;8 Seconds&quot; (1994), and the first three &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; films.

He was the original director for both &quot;Serpico&quot; (1973) and &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977), but was fired over disputes with, respectively, producers Martin Bregman and Robert Stigwood. Although his job directing &quot;Serpico&quot; was terminated, Avildsen became long time friends with the film&#x27;s real life subject Frank Serpico, even sharing a property with him on Long Island, New York during the early 1980s.

His last film was &quot;Inferno&quot; (1999), starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.

A documentary on the life, career and films of Avildsen was released in August 2017, approximately two months after his death. &quot;John G. Avildsen: King of the Underdogs&quot; (2017), directed and produced by Derek Wayne Johnson, features interviews with Sylvester Stallone, Ralph Macchio, Martin Scorsese, Jerry Weintraub, and Burt Reynolds, among others. The documentary is a companion to the book &quot;The Films of John G. Avildsen: Rocky, The Karate Kid, and other Underdogs&quot;, written by Larry Powell and Tom Garrett.

==Personal life==
Avildsen&#x27;s first wife was Marie Olga Maturevich (Melissa McCall). After they divorced, he married actress Tracy Brooks Swope in 1987; they separated in 2006. He had four children. His estranged son, Ash (born November 5, 1981), founded Sumerian Records and has a son, Izzy Avildsen. Another son, Jonathan Avildsen, appeared in the films &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; and &quot;Rocky V&quot;. His eldest son was named Anthony, and he had a daughter, Penelope Avildsen. John also had a daughter with Tracy Swope, named Bridget.

===Death===
Avildsen died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on June 16, 2017. He was 81. The cause of his death was pancreatic cancer, according to his son Anthony Avildsen.

<text>Patmos (, ) is a Greek island in the Aegean Sea. It is famous as the location where, according to Christian belief, John of Patmos received the visions found in the Book of Revelation of the New Testament, and where the book was written.

One of the northernmost islands of the Dodecanese complex, Patmos has a population of 3,283 (2021) and an area of . The highest point is Profitis Ilias, above sea level. The municipality of Patmos, which includes the offshore islands of Arkoi (pop. 44), Marathos (pop. 5), and several uninhabited islets, has a total population of 3,047 (2011 census) and a combined land area of . It is part of the Kalymnos regional unit.

In 1999, the island&#x27;s historic center Chora, along with the Monastery of Saint John the Theologian and the Cave of the Apocalypse, were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO because of their significance in Christianity and the preservation of ancient religious ceremonies that occur on the island. The monastery was founded by Christodoulos Latrinos. Patmos is also home to the Patmian School, a notable Greek seminary.

==History==


===The birth of Patmos according to Greek mythology===

According to a legend in Greek mythology, the island&#x27;s original name was &quot;Letois&quot;, after the goddess and huntress of deer, Artemis, daughter of Leto. It was believed that Patmos came into existence thanks to her divine intervention.

Artemis frequently paid visits to Caria, the mainland across the shore from Patmos, where she had a shrine on Mount Latmus. There she met the moon goddess Selene, who cast her light on the ocean, revealing the sunken island of Patmos.

Selene was always trying to get Artemis to bring the sunken island to the surface and hence to life. Selene finally convinced Artemis, who then gained her brother Apollo&#x27;s help to persuade Zeus to allow the island to rise from the sea.

Zeus agreed, and the island emerged from the water. The sun dried up the land and brought life to it. Gradually, inhabitants from the surrounding areas, including Mount Latmos, settled on the island and named it &quot;Letois&quot; in honour of Artemis.

===History from the Classical period to the present===
Patmos is seldom mentioned by ancient writers. Therefore, very little is known about the earliest inhabitants. In the Classical period, the Patmians prefer to identify themselves as Dorians descending from the families of Argos, Sparta and Epidaurus, further mingling with people of Ionian ancestry.

During the 3rd century BC, in the Hellenistic period, the settlement of Patmos acquired the form of an acropolis with an improved defence through a fortification wall and towers.

Patmos is mentioned in the Book of Revelation, the last book of the Christian Bible. The book&#x27;s introduction states that its author, John, was on Patmos when he was given (and recorded) a vision from Jesus. Early Christian tradition identified this writer John of Patmos as John the Apostle. For this reason, Patmos is a destination for Christian pilgrimage. Visitors can see the cave where John is said to have received his Revelation (the Cave of the Apocalypse), and several monasteries on the island are dedicated to Saint John.

After the death of John of Patmos, possibly around 100 AD, a number of Early Christian basilicas were erected on Patmos. Among these was a Grand Royal Basilica in honour of Saint John, built c. 300–350 AD at the location where the Monastery of Saint John the Theologian stands today.

Early Christian life on Patmos, however, barely survived Muslim raids from the 7th to the 9th century. During this period, the Grand Basilica was destroyed. In 1088, the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos gave Christodoulos Latrinos the complete authority over the island of Patmos, as well as the permission to build a monastery on the island. The construction of the monastery started in 1101.

Population was expanded by infusions of Byzantine immigrants fleeing the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, and Cretan immigrants fleeing the fall of Candia in 1669.

The island was controlled by the Ottoman Empire for many years, but it enjoyed certain privileges, mostly related to tax-free trade by the monastery as certified by Ottoman imperial documents held in the Library. Ottoman rule in Patmos (&quot;Batnaz&quot; in Ottoman Turkish) was interrupted by initially Venetian occupation during Candian War between 1659 and 1669, then Russian occupation during Orlov Revolt between 1770 and 1774 and finally during the Greek War of Independence.

In 1912, in connection with the Italo-Turkish War, the Italians occupied all the islands of the Dodecanese (except Kastellorizo), including Patmos. The Italians remained there until 1943, when Nazi Germany took over the island.

In 1945, the Germans left and the island of Patmos remained autonomous until 1948, when, together with the rest of the Dodecanese Islands, it joined the independent Greece.

===21st century===
In September 2008, the municipality of Patmos refused landing to a group of undocumented refugees from Afghanistan and Iraq when they were taken there for processing and care after a sea rescue. The administration refused them permission to land. Eventually they were sent to the island of Leros where they were processed and given humanitarian aid.

&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, in 2009, named Patmos &quot;Europe&#x27;s most idyllic place to live&quot;, writing that &quot;Patmos has evolved over the centuries but has not lost its air of quiet tranquility, which is one reason why people that know it return again and again&quot;.

==Geography==
Patmos is situated off the west coast of Turkey and the continent of Asia. It is one of the northernmost islands of the Dodecanese complex. It is further west than its nearby neighboring islands.

It has an area of . The highest point is Profitis Ilias, above sea level.

Patmos&#x27; main communities are Chora (the capital city) and Skala, the only commercial port. Other settlements are Grikou and Kampos.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
Patmos&#x27;s economy is largely reliant on tourism during the summer months with Christian pilgrims frequently visiting due to the island&#x27;s connection with the apostle John and the writing of the Book of Revelation.

The Monastery of Saint John and the Cave of the Apocalypse are among the sites most often visited by pilgrims. However, the beaches and quiet natural beauty have also led to an increase in tourists. 

Investors from SMERemediumCap (SMERC) have recently committed 20 million euro to build a luxury hotel situated on the Greek island of Patmos. The aim of this project is to enhance the tourism appeal of the island. This investment is the largest ever made on the island and highlights the commitment of SMERC to promote Patmos as a world-class tourist destination.

As one of the quietest Greek Islands, the island&#x27;s natural beauty and UNESCO World Heritage monuments, combined with its intense spirituality, have a profound impact on visitors and leave them deeply moved.

==Health==
For emergencies, Patmos has a medical centre, with several medical doctors on the premises. When residents require hospitalization beyond first aid, they are airlifted out of the island by helicopter (in emergencies) to nearby hospitals or, if the weather permits, they are transported by ferry.

==Infrastructure==

===Ferry===
The Island of Patmos has regular ferry services, which connect it to the following ports: Agathonissi Island, Mykonos Island, Paros Island, Piraeus (the main port of Athens), Pythagoreio and Karlovassi on Samos Island, Syros Island, Leros Island, Naxos Island, Arkoi, Lipsi Island, Symi Island and Rhodes Island.

<text>Composite armour is a type of vehicle armour consisting of layers of different materials such as metals, plastics, ceramics or air. Most composite armours are lighter than their all-metal equivalent, but instead occupy a larger volume for the same resistance to penetration. It is possible to design composite armour stronger, lighter and less voluminous than traditional armour, but the cost is often prohibitively high, restricting its use to especially vulnerable parts of a vehicle. Its primary purpose is to help defeat high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) projectiles.

HEAT had posed a serious threat to armoured vehicles since its introduction in World War II. Lightweight and small, HEAT projectiles could nevertheless penetrate hundreds of millimetres of the most resistant steel armours. The capability of most materials for defeating HEAT follows the &quot;density law&quot;, which states that the penetration of shaped charge jets is proportional to the square root of the shaped charge liner density (typically copper) divided by the square root of the target density. On a weight basis, lighter targets are more advantageous than heavier targets, but using large quantities of lightweight materials has obvious disadvantages in terms of mechanical layout. Certain materials have an optimal compromise in terms of density that makes them particularly useful in this role.

==History==
Some early ironclads used armor composed of multiple layers of thinner armor bolted or welded together. The results were greatly less effective for a given overall thickness than a single plate, but was done because making thicker plates or plates with different metallurgical properties through their thickness (for example Harvey armor) was prohibitively expensive or too technically challenging. Teak was used to sandwich layers that could not be easily fitted together, or provide a backing to catch splinters.

During WWII, in an effort to provide protection against the German Army’s Panzerfaust anti-tank weapon, an M4A3 was fitted with an armor “kit” incorporating a mixture of quartz gravel, asphalt and wood flour known as “HCR2.” This add-on armor was successfully live-fire tested in September 1945 against both the German Panzerfaust and 76mm High-Velocity Armor Piercing (HVAP) ammunition. Aside from this early test, the first serious development began as part of the US Army&#x27;s T95 experimental series from the mid-1950s. The T95 featured &quot;siliceous-cored armour&quot; which contained a plate of fused silica glass between rolled steel plates. The stopping power of glass exceeds that of steel armour on a thickness basis and in many cases glass is more than twice as effective as steel on a thickness basis. Although the T95 never entered production, a number of its concepts were used on the M60 Patton, and during the development stage (as the XM60) the siliceous-cored armour was at least considered for use, although it was not a feature of the production vehicles.

The first widespread use of a composite armour appears to have been on the Soviet T-64. It used an armour known as &quot;combination K&quot;, which apparently is glass-reinforced plastic sandwiched between inner and outer steel layers. Through a mechanism called thixotropy, the resin changes to a fluid under constant pressure, allowing the armour to be moulded into curved shapes. Later models of the T-64, along with newer designs, use a boron carbide-filled resin aggregate for greatly improved protection . The Soviets also invested heavily in reactive armour, which allowed them some ability to control quality, even after production.

Among NATO nations and allies, the most common type of composite armour today is Chobham armour, first developed and used by the British in the experimental FV 4211 tank, which was based on Chieftain tank components. Chobham uses multiple non-explosive reactive armour plates (NERA), which sandwich a layer of elastomer (like rubber) between two plates of steel armour. This was shown to dramatically increase the resistance to HEAT projectiles, even in comparison to other composite armour designs. Chobham was such an improvement that it was soon used on the new U.S. M1 Abrams main battle tank (MBT) as well. The need to mount multiple angled plates, along with an outer steel layer to protect the armour array, gives the Challenger and Abrams their &quot;slab sided&quot; look.

The Soviets/Russians had a similar composite armour to the West&#x27;s own &quot;NERA&quot;, with rubber sandwiches between plates of steel. This armour was confirmed to be inside the T-72B&#x27;s &quot;Super Dolly Parton&quot; armour, but is suspected to be inside the T-80A as well, since it is unlikely the Soviets would put worse armour in their &quot;premier&quot; tank.

==Design==
Chobham armour defeats HEAT warheads by disrupting the high speed jet generated by the warhead. The outer steel &quot;burster&quot; plate detonates the shell and protects the composite array from the blast, increasing the armour&#x27;s multi hit abilities. After making it through the burster plate, the jet penetrates into the first NERA plate, and begins to compress the elastomer. The elastomer quickly reaches maximum compression and rapidly expands, pushing the two steel plates in opposite directions. It is the movement of the steel plates that disrupts the jet, both by feeding more material into the jet&#x27;s path, and introducing lateral forces to break the jet apart. The effectiveness of the system was amply demonstrated in Desert Storm, where not a single British Army Challenger tank was lost to enemy tank fire. (However, one was destroyed by friendly fire on March 25, 2003, killing two crew members after a HESH projectile detonated on the commander&#x27;s hatch causing high-velocity fragments to enter the turret.) Chobham-type armour is currently in its third generation and is used on modern western tanks such as the British Challenger 2 and the American M1 Abrams. The Abrams is also unique in its usage of depleted uranium armour plates in conjunction with composite armour, increasing overall vehicle protection. The Leopard 2A4 is similar in its use of tungsten inserts.

==Use==
All modern third-generation main battle tanks use composite armour arrays in their construction. While many of these vehicles feature the composite armour permanently integrated with the vehicle, the Japanese Type 10 and Type 90 Kyū-maru MBTs, French Leclerc, Iranian Karrar, Turkish Altay, Indian Arjun, Italian Ariete and Chinese Type 96/98 and Type 99 tanks use a modular composite armour, where sections of the composite armour can be easily and quickly switched out or upgraded with armour modules. The adoption of modular composite armour design facilitates far more efficient and easier upgrades and exchanges of the armour.

Soviet/Russian main battle tanks such as T-90s, T-80Us and the Chinese Type 96/99s use composite armour in tandem with explosive reactive armour (ERA), making it hard for shaped charge munitions such as HEAT projectiles and missile warheads to penetrate the frontal and a portion of their side armour. The most advanced versions of these armours such as the Relikt and Kontakt-5 armour provide protection not only against shaped charges but also kinetic energy penetrators by using the explosive force to shear the projectile apart.

Applique armour has also been used in conjunction with composite armour to provide increased amounts of protection and to supplant existing composite arrays on a vehicle. The German Leopard 2A5 featured distinctive arrowhead laminated armour modules that was mounted directly onto the turret composite arrays, increasing protection markedly above the previous 2A4 model.

Composite armour has since been applied to smaller vehicles, right down to jeep-sized automobiles. Many of these systems are applied as upgrades to existing armour, which makes them difficult to place around the entire vehicle. Nevertheless, they are often surprisingly effective; upgrades with MEXAS ceramic armour to Canadian M113s were carried out in the 1990s, after it was realized that it would offer more protection than newly built IFVs like the M2 Bradley.

==Improvised==
In 2004, American Marvin Heemeyer used an &quot;ad hoc&quot; composite armour on his Komatsu D355A bulldozer (&quot;which he called the MK Tank and in popular culture, the Killdozer&quot;) used in a rampage in response to a dispute with the city he lived in over a zoning issue. The armour, at some places a thick, consisted of a layer of concrete sandwiched between layers of steel, successfully rendering the vehicle impervious to small arms fire and small explosives used by law enforcement in an attempt to stop the vehicle.

<text>A first-generation programming language (1GL) is a machine-level programming language and belongs to the low-level programming languages.

A first generation (programming) language (1GL) is a grouping of programming languages that are machine level languages used to program first-generation computers. Originally, no translator was used to compile or assemble the first-generation language. The first-generation programming instructions were entered through the front panel switches of the computer system.

The instructions in 1GL are made of binary numbers, represented by 1s and 0s. This makes the language suitable for the understanding of the machine but far more difficult to interpret and learn by the human programmer.

The main advantage of programming in 1GL is that the code can run very fast and very efficiently, precisely because the instructions are executed directly by the central processing unit (CPU). One of the main disadvantages of programming in a low level language is that when an error occurs, the code is not as easy to fix.

First generation languages are very much adapted to a specific computer and CPU, and code portability is therefore significantly reduced in comparison to higher level languages.

Modern day programmers still occasionally use machine level code, especially when programming lower level functions of the system, such as drivers, interfaces with firmware and hardware devices. Modern tools such as native-code compilers are used to produce machine level from a higher-level language.

<text>The Somme (; ) is a department of France, located in the north of the country and named after the Somme river. It is part of the Hauts-de-France region. It is bordered by Pas-de-Calais and Nord to the north, Aisne to the east, Oise to the south and Seine-Maritime to the southwest. To the northwest, its coastline faces the English Channel and it shares maritime borders with Kent and East Sussex in the United Kingdom. It had a population of 570,559 in 2019.

The north central area of the Somme was the site of a series of battles during World War I, including the particularly significant Battle of the Somme in 1916. As a result of this and other battles fought in the area, the department is home to many military cemeteries and several major monuments commemorating the many soldiers from various countries who died on its battlefields. The 1346 Battle of Crécy, a major English victory early in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, also took place in this department.

==History==
The toponymy of Somme is speculated to come from a Gaulish term, &quot;Sumena&quot;.

==Geography==
The Somme department is in the current region of Hauts-de-France and is surrounded by the departments of Pas-de-Calais, Nord, Aisne, Oise and Seine-Maritime. In the northwest, it has a coast on the English Channel. The main rivers are the Somme and its tributaries (Avre, Ancre and Noye, the Authie) as well as the Bresle.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Amiens, the prefecture. , there are 9 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

==Battles of the Somme==

At the beginning of the First World War, during the Race to the Sea of September and November 1914, the Somme became the site of the Battle of Albert. The battle was a five-day engagement between 25 and 29 September, with the French Tenth Army attacking at Albert and pushing toward Bapaume, and the German Sixth Army counter-attacking back towards Albert. The line settled around the town of Thiepval and remained there until July 1916, when the Battle of the Somme was fought on and around the same ground.

The Battle of the Somme was one of the most costly battles of World War I, by the number of troop casualties, as Allied forces attempted to break through the German lines along a front north and south of the River Somme. The Allies had originally intended the Somme to be the site of one of several simultaneous major offensives by Allied powers against the Central Powers in 1916. However, before these offensives could begin, the Germans attacked first, engaging the Allies at the Battle of Verdun. As this battle dragged on, the purpose of the Somme campaign (which was still in the planning stage) shifted from striking a decisive blow against Germany to drawing German forces away from Verdun and relieving the Allied forces there. By its end, the losses on the Somme had exceeded those at Verdun.

While Verdun would bite deep in the national consciousness of France for generations, the Somme would have the same effect on generations of Britons. The battle is best remembered for its first day, 1 July 1916, on which the British suffered 57,420 casualties, including 19,240 dead—the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army to this day. As terrible as the battle was for the British Empire troops who suffered there, it naturally affected the other nationalities as well. By the end of the battle, the British had learned many lessons in modern warfare, while the Germans had suffered irreplaceable losses. British historian Sir James Edmonds stated, &quot;It is not too much to claim that the foundations of the final victory on the Western Front were laid by the Somme offensive of 1916&quot;.

For the first time, the home front in Britain was exposed to the horrors of modern war with the release of the propaganda film &quot;The Battle of the Somme&quot;, which used actual footage from the first days of the battle.

The Somme experienced war twice more in the First and Second Battles of the Somme of 1918.
