<text>Praxiteles (; ) of Athens, the son of Cephisodotus the Elder, was the most renowned of the Attic sculptors of the 4th century BC. He was the first to sculpt the nude female form in a life-size statue. While no indubitably attributable sculpture by Praxiteles is extant, numerous copies of his works have survived; several authors, including Pliny the Elder, wrote of his works; and coins engraved with silhouettes of his various famous statuary types from the period still exist.

A supposed relationship between Praxiteles and his beautiful model, the Thespian courtesan Phryne, has inspired speculation and interpretation in works of art ranging from painting (Gérôme) to comic opera (Saint-Saëns) to shadow play (Donnay).

Some writers have maintained that there were two sculptors of the name Praxiteles. One was a contemporary of Pheidias, and the other his more celebrated grandson. Though the repetition of the same name in every other generation is common in Greece, there is no certain evidence for either position.

==Date==

Accurate dates for Praxiteles are elusive, but it is likely that he was no longer working in the time of Alexander the Great, in the absence of evidence that Alexander employed Praxiteles, as he probably would have done. Pliny&#x27;s date, 364 BC, is probably that of one of his most noted works.

The subjects chosen by Praxiteles were either human beings or the dignified and less elderly deities such as Apollo, Hermes and Aphrodite rather than Zeus, Poseidon or Themis.
He probably invented the S-curve.

Praxiteles and his school worked almost entirely in Parian marble. At the time the marble quarries of Paros were at their best; nor could any marble be finer for the purposes of the sculptor than that of which the Hermes from Olympia was fashioned. Some of the statues of Praxiteles were coloured by the painter Nicias, and in the opinion of the sculptor they gained greatly by this treatment.

===&quot;Hermes and the Infant Dionysus&quot;===
In 1911, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; noted that
: Our knowledge of Praxiteles has received a great addition, and has been placed on a satisfactory basis, by the discovery at Olympia in 1877 of his statue of &quot;Hermes with the Infant Dionysus&quot;, a statue which has become famous throughout the world.

Later opinions have varied, reaching a low with the sculptor Aristide Maillol, who railed, &quot;It&#x27;s kitsch, it&#x27;s frightful, it&#x27;s sculpted in Marseille soap&quot;. In 1948, Carl Blümel published it in a monograph as &quot;The Hermes of &quot;a&quot; Praxiteles&quot;, reversing his earlier (1927) opinion that it was a Roman copy, finding it not 4th century either, but referring it instead to a Hellenistic sculptor, a younger Praxiteles of Pergamon.

The sculpture was located where Pausanias had seen it in the late 2nd century AD. Hermes is represented in the act of carrying the child Dionysus to the nymphs who were charged with his rearing. The uplifted right arm is missing, but the possibility that the god holds out to the child a bunch of grapes to excite his desire would reduce the subject to a genre figure, Waldstein (1882) noted that Hermes looks past the child, &quot;the clearest and most manifest outward sign of inward dreaming&quot;. The statue is today exhibited at the Archaeological Museum of Olympia.

Opposing arguments have been made that the statue is a copy by a Roman copyist, perhaps of a work by Praxiteles that the Romans had purloined. Wallace (1940) suggested a 2nd-century date and a Pergamene origin on the basis of the sandal type. Other assertions have been attempted by scholars to prove the origins of the statue on the basis of the unfinished back, the appearance of the drapery, and the technique used with the drilling of the hair; however scholars cannot conclusively use any of these arguments to their advantage because exceptions exist in both Roman and Greek sculpture.

===Apollo Sauroktonos===

Other works that appear to be copies of Praxiteles&#x27; sculpture express the same gracefulness in repose and indefinable charm as the &quot;Hermes and the Infant Dionysus&quot;. Among the most notable of these are the &quot;Apollo Sauroktonos&quot;, or the lizard-slayer, which portrays a youth leaning against a tree and idly striking with an arrow at a lizard. Several Roman copies from the 1st century are known including those at the Louvre Museum, the Vatican Museums, and the National Museums Liverpool.

On June 22, 2004, the Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA), announced the acquisition of an ancient bronze sculpture of &quot;Apollo Sauroktonos.&quot; The work is alleged to be the only near-complete original work by Praxiteles, though the dating and attribution of the sculpture will continue to be studied. The work was to be included in the 2007 Praxiteles exhibition organized by the Louvre Museum in Paris, but pressure from Greece, which disputes the work&#x27;s provenance and legal ownership, caused the French to exclude it from the show.

===Apollo Lykeios===
The Apollo Lykeios or Lycian Apollo, another Apollo-type reclining on a tree, is usually attributed to Praxiteles. It shows the god resting on a support (a tree trunk or tripod), his right arm touching the top of his head, and his hair fixed in braids on the top of a head in a haircut typical of childhood. It is called &quot;Lycian&quot; not after Lycia itself, but after its identification with a lost work described by Lucian as being on show in the &quot;Lykeion&quot;, one of the gymnasia of Athens.

===Capitoline Satyr===

The &quot;Resting Satyr&quot; of the Capitol at Rome has commonly been regarded as a copy of one of the Satyrs of Praxiteles, but it cannot be identified in the list of his works. Moreover, the style is hard and poor; a far superior replica exists in a torso in the Louvre. The attitude and character of the work are certainly of Praxitelean school.

===Leto, Apollo, and Artemis===
Excavations at Mantineia in Arcadia have brought to light the base of a group of Leto, Apollo, and Artemis by Praxiteles. This base was doubtless not the work of the great sculptor himself, but of one of his assistants. Nevertheless, it is pleasing and historically valuable. Pausanias (viii. 9, I) thus describes the base, &quot;on the base which supports the statues there are sculptured the Muses and Marsyas playing the flutes (&quot;auloi&quot;).&quot; Three slabs which have survived represent Apollo; Marsyas; a slave, and six of the Muses, the slab which held the other three having disappeared.

===Leconfield Head===
The &quot;Leconfield Head&quot; (a head of the Aphrodite of Cnidus type, included in the 2007 exhibition at the Louvre) in the Red Room, Petworth House, West Sussex, UK, was claimed by Adolf Furtwängler to be an actual work of Praxiteles, based on its style and its intrinsic quality. The Leconfield Head, the keystone of the Greek antiquities at Petworth was probably bought from Gavin Hamilton in Rome in 1755.
===Aberdeen Head===
The &quot;Aberdeen Head&quot;, whether of Hermes or of a youthful Heracles, in the British Museum, is linked to Praxiteles by its striking resemblance to the &quot;Hermes of Olympia&quot;.

===Aphrodite of Cnidus===

&quot;Aphrodite of Cnidus&quot; was Praxiteles&#x27;s most famous statue. It was the first time that a full-scale female figure was portrayed nude. It was bought by the people of Cnidus, and according to Pliny valued so highly by them that they refused to sell it to King Nicomedes in exchange for discharging the city&#x27;s enormous debt. Many copies survive, the Colonna Venus in the Vatican Museums often having been considered the most faithful to the original.

Its renown was such, that it was immortalised in a lyric epigram:

===Artemis of Antikyra===
According to Pausanias there was a statue of Artemis made by Praxiteles in her temple in Anticyra of Phokis. The appearance of the statue, which represented the goddess with a torch and an arch in her hands and a dog at her feet, is known from a 2nd-century BC bronze coin of the city. A recently discovered dedicatory inscription of the 3rd-2nd century identifies the goddess at Antikya as Artemis Eleithyia.

===Uncertain attributions===
Vitruvius (vii, . 13) lists Praxiteles as an artist on the Mausoleum of Maussollos and Strabo (xiv, 23, 51) attributes to him the whole sculpted decoration of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. These mentions are widely considered as dubious.

===Roman copies===

Besides these works, associated with Praxiteles by reference to notices in ancient writers, there are numerous copies from the Roman age, statues of Hermes, Dionysus, Aphrodite, Satyrs and Nymphs, and the like, in which a varied expression of Praxitelean style may be discerned.

<doc id="79995" wikidata="Q1750471" url="?curid=79995" title="Sly syndrome">
<text>Sly syndrome, also called [[mucopolysaccharidosis]] type VII (MPS-VII), is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme β-glucuronidase. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (AKA GAGs, or mucopolysaccharides). The inability to break down GAGs leads to a buildup in many tissues and organs of the body. The severity of the disease can vary widely.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most severe cases of Sly syndrome can result in hydrops fetalis, which results in fetal death or death soon after birth. Some people with Sly syndrome may begin to have symptoms in early childhood. Symptoms can include an enlarged head, fluid buildup in the brain, coarse facial features, enlarged tongue, enlarged liver, enlarged spleen, problems with the heart valves, and abdominal hernias. People with Sly syndrome may also have sleep apnea, frequent lung infections, and problems with vision secondary to cloudy corneas. Sly syndrome causes various musculoskeletal abnormalities that worsen with age. These can include short stature, joint deformities, dysostosis multiplex, spinal stenosis, and carpal tunnel syndrome.

While some individuals have developmental delay, others may have normal intelligence. However, the accumulation of GAGs in the brain usually leads to the slowing of development from ages 1–3, and then a loss of previously learned skills until death.

==Genetics==

The defective gene responsible for Sly syndrome is located on chromosome 7.

==Diagnosis==
Most people with Sly disease will have elevated levels of GAGs seen in the urine. A confirmatory test is necessary for diagnosis. Skin cells and red blood cells of affected people will have low levels of β-glucuronidase activity. Sly syndrome can also be diagnosed through prenatal testing.

==Treatment==
Vestronidase alfa-vjbk (trade name Mepsevii), an enzyme replacement therapy which is a recombinant form of human β-glucuronidase, is approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Sly syndrome. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has been used to treat other types of MPS diseases, but this is not yet available for MPS-VII. Animal experiments suggest that HSCT may be an effective treatment for MPS-VII in humans.

==Prognosis==
The life expectancy of individuals with MPS VII varies depending on the symptoms. Some individuals are stillborn, while some may survive into adulthood.

==Epidemiology==
MPS-VII is one of the rarest forms of MPS. It occurs in less than 1 in 250,000 births. As a family, MPS diseases occur in 1 in 25,000 births, and the larger family of lysosomal storage diseases occur in 1 out of 7,000 to 8,000 births.

==History==
Sly syndrome was originally discovered in 1972. It was named after its discoverer William S. Sly, an American biochemist who has spent nearly his entire academic career at Saint Louis University.

<text>Igor Yevgenyevich Tamm (; 8 July 1895 – 12 April 1971) was a Soviet physicist who received the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physics, jointly with Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov and Ilya Mikhailovich Frank, for their 1934 discovery and demonstration of Cherenkov radiation. He also predicted the quasi-particle of sound: the phonon; and in 1951, together with Andrei Sakharov, proposed the Tokamak system.

==Biography==

Igor Tamm was born in 1895 in Vladivostok into the family of Eugene Tamm, a civil engineer, and his wife Olga Davydova. According to Russian sources, Tamm had German noble descent on his father&#x27;s side through his grandfather Theodor Tamm, who emigrated from Thuringia. Although his surname &quot;Tamm&quot; is rather common in Estonia, other sources state he was Jewish or had Jewish ancestry.

He studied at a gymnasium in Elisavetgrad (now Kropyvnytskyi, Ukraine). In 1913–1914 he studied at the University of Edinburgh together with his school-friend Boris Hessen.

At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 he joined the army as a volunteer field medic. In 1917 he joined the Revolutionary movement and became an active anti-war campaigner, serving on revolutionary committees after the March Revolution. He returned to the Moscow State University from which he graduated in 1918.

Tamm married Nataliya Shuyskaya (1894–1980) in September 1917. Shе belonged to a noble Rurikid Shuysky family. They eventually had two children, Irina (1921–2009, chemist) and Evgeny (1926–2008, experimental physicist and famous mountain climber, leader of the Soviet Everest expedition in 1982).

On 1 May 1923, Tamm began teaching physics at the Second Moscow State University. The same year, he finished his first scientific paper, &quot;Electrodynamics of the Anisotropic Medium in the Special Theory of Relativity&quot;. In 1928, he spent a few months with Paul Ehrenfest at the University of Leiden and made a life-long friendship with Paul Dirac. From 1934 until his death in 1971 Tamm was the head of the theoretical department at Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow.

In 1932, Tamm published a paper with his proposal of the concept of surface states. This concept is important for metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) physics.

In 1934, Tamm and Semen Altshuller suggested that the neutron has a non-zero magnetic moment, the idea was met with scepticism at that time, as the neutron was supposed to be an elementary particle with zero charge, and thus could not have a magnetic moment. The same year, Tamm coined an idea that proton-neutron interactions can be described as an exchange force transmitted by a yet unknown massive particle, this idea was later developed by Hideki Yukawa into a theory of meson forces.

In 1945 he developed an approximation method for many-body physics. As Sidney Dancoff developed it independently in 1950, it is now called the Tamm-Dancoff approximation.

He was the Nobel Laureate in Physics for the year 1958 together with Pavel Cherenkov and Ilya Frank for the discovery and the interpretation of the Cherenkov-Vavilov effect.

In late 1940s to early 1950s Tamm was involved in the Soviet thermonuclear bomb project; in 1949–1953 he spent most of his time in the &quot;secret city&quot; of Sarov, working as a head of the theoretical group developing the hydrogen bomb, however he retired from the project and returned to the Moscow Lebedev Physical Institute after the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb in 1953.

In 1951, together with Andrei Sakharov, Tamm proposed a tokamak system for the realization of controlled thermonuclear fusion on the basis of toroidal magnetic thermonuclear reactor and soon after the first such devices were built by the INF. Results from the T-3 Soviet magnetic confinement device in 1968, when the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma] parameters unique for that time were obtained, showed temperatures in their machine to be over an order of magnitude higher than what was expected by the rest of the community. The western scientists visited the experiment and verified the high temperatures and confinement, sparking a wave of optimism for the prospects of the tokamak as well as construction of new experiments, which is still the dominant magnetic confinement device today.

In 1964 he was elected a Member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].

Tamm was a student of [[Leonid Isaakovich Mandelshtam]] in science and life.

Tamm was an atheist.

Tamm died in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]] on 12 April 1971, the Lunar crater [[Tamm (crater)|Tamm]] is named after him. He is buried at [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].

<text>Tables games are a class of board game that includes backgammon and which are played on a tables board, typically with two rows of 12 vertical markings called points. Players roll dice to determine the movement of pieces. Tables games are among the oldest known board games, and many different varieties are played throughout the world. They are called &#x27;tables&#x27; games because the boards consist of four quadrants or &#x27;tables&#x27;. The vast majority are race games, the tables board representing a linear race track with start and finish points, the aim being to be first to the finish line, but the characteristic features that distinguish tables games from other race games are that they are two-player games using a large number of pieces, usually fifteen per player.

Tables games should not be confused with table games which are casino gambling games like roulette or blackjack.

== Name ==
The word &#x27;tables&#x27; is derived from the Latin &quot;tabula&quot; which primarily meant &#x27;board&#x27; or &#x27;plank&#x27;, but also referred to this genre of game. From its plural form, &quot;tabulae&quot;, come the names in other languages for this family of games including the Anglo-Saxon &quot;toefel&quot;, German &quot;[wurf]zabel&quot;, Greek &quot;tavli&quot;, Italian &quot;tavoli&quot;, Scandinavian &quot;tafl&quot;, Spanish &quot;tablas&quot; and, of course, English and French &quot;tables&quot;. The reason for the plural is twofold: first, that a tables board comprises four separate quadrants which are a feature of the play; and second, that &quot;tabulae&quot; also came to refer to the individual pieces – &#x27;tablemen&#x27; or &#x27;men&#x27; for short – used in the various games.

== Definition ==
Most, but not all, tables games are a type of race game. They are characterised as being:
* Played by two players and hence bilaterally symmetrical.
* Multiplex games; i.e., players have a large number of pieces.
* Played on a rectangular board with players sitting on the long sides.
* Played on a board with four quarters known as tables, hence the name.

== Types ==
Tables games may be classified by movement or by tactics.

=== Movement ===
Parlett (1999) identifies three different modes of movement in tables games:

==== Games without movement ====
A small number of tables games involve no actual movement of pieces around the board. Instead pieces are entered or borne off or both, the aim being to be the first player to do so. Examples include Alfonso&#x27;s Los Doze Canes also called Los Doze Hermanos, the English games of Doublets and Catch Dolt, the French games Renette, Tables Rabattues and Paumecary, the Icelandic game of Ofanfelling and the Levantine game of Eureika. Most of these games are simple pursuits suitable for children.

==== Games of contrary movement ====
This is the group to which Backgammon belongs. Some start with all pieces off the board, others with a fixed starting layout, but the aim in every case is to race them around the board in opposite directions and be first to bear them off. The group also includes Acey Deucey, known as Gegenpuff in German-speaking countries, Plakota, the &#x27;English Game&#x27;, the Spanish games of Emperador, Quinze Tablas and Todas Tablas, the Italian games of Tavole Reales and Testa, and the French games of Tieste, Impérial and Trictrac.

==== Games of parallel movement ====
Like other members of the tables family, games in this last group are often mistaken for Backgammon or assumed to be its variants, yet the direction of movement and hence play is quite different. Players move in the same direction around the board and that direction is always anticlockwise. The group includes the old German games of Langer Puff (known confusingly in English as German or Russian Backgammon) and Buffa, the Italian game of Buffa Cortese, the Spanish games of Laquet and Pareia de Entrada, the continental game of Verquere, French Jacquet, Turkish Moultezim and a curious Icelandic game called Chase the Girls.

=== Tactics ===
Papahristou &amp; Refanidis (2013) categorise tables games by the type of attacking tactics permitted during the game:

==== Hitting games ====
This is the standard tactic in games of contrary movement such as Backgammon where players move their pieces in opposing directions. In a hitting game, the players may hit enemy blots off the board. To do this a point must be occupied by only one opposing piece – this is called a blot – and the attacking player must move a piece onto that point. The blot is &#x27;hit&#x27; or &#x27;knocked off&#x27; the board and is usually placed on the bar between the two halves of the board.

==== Pinning games ====
Pinning games are also games of contrary movement. However, no hitting is allowed. Instead, the attacking player may pin a blot by moving a piece onto the same point. The blot is not removed from the board, but is trapped and not permitted to move until the covering man is moved off. Plakoto is an example of a pinning game.

==== Running games ====
A running game is a game in which no hitting or pinning is allowed and the game is essentially a race to bear off all one&#x27;s pieces first. Points occupied even by one enemy man are blocked to the other side. They are usually games of parallel movement, like Fevga, where players move around the board in the same direction, but some, like Gioul are games of contrary movement where players race their pieces past one another in opposing directions.

==History==
Numerous archaeological discoveries witness to game boards and artefacts bearing a strong resemblance to those used in race games and ancient texts give an idea of their play in some cases. These bilateral race games may well be the ancestors of the tables game family. They include the Alea, Dogs and Jackals, Duodecim Scripta, the Game of Twenty, Grammai, the Royal Game of Ur, Senet and Nard.

The history of tables games may be divided into different periods of development:

* Pre-classical period: Grammai and other early race games
* Classical period: notably Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula
* Nard period: from its invention or earliest appearance in Southwestern Asia (or Persia) before AD 800
* Tables period: tables games from their arrival in Spain or Italy from the Arabic world around the turn of the first millennium
* Modern period: the rise of more sophisticated games from the 15th century onwards including Trictrac and Backgammon

=== Pre-classical period ===
==== Persia ====
The history of tables games and their race game forerunners can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to the Persia, where excavations in 2006 at the Burnt City unearthed objects that appear to be part of a game set dating to around 3000 BC. These artefacts include an ebony board, two dice and 60 pieces, with the playing fields represented by the coils of a serpent. The rules of this game, like others found in Egypt, have yet to be discovered. It is, however, made from ebony, a material more likely to be found in the Indian subcontinent, which indicates such board games may be more widespread than once thought.

==== Mesopotamia ====
Prior to the Persian discovery, the oldest board game sets had been found in Ur and are thought to be around 100 to 200 years later. They were used for the Royal Game of Ur, played in ancient Mesopotamia. These finds are significant because of two Babylonian tablets with cuneiform descriptions of the game played on these game sets, the later one dated and the other one dating to several centuries earlier. These represent the oldest rule sets of any race game and clearly show this Sumerian game to be ancestral to the tables game family.

==== Egypt ====
Another ancient race game was Senet, played by the ancient Egyptians around the same time. Board fragments that could be Senet have been found in First Dynasty burials in Egypt, , but the first painting of this ancient game is from the Third Dynasty (–2613 BC). People are depicted playing Senet in a painting in the tomb of Rashepes, as well as other tombs dating to . The oldest complete Senet boards date to the Middle Kingdom.

Senet was played in neighbouring cultures, probably arriving there through trade links with the Egyptians. It has been found in the Levant at sites such as Arad and Byblos, as well as in Cyprus. Because of the local practice of making games out of stone, more Senet games have survived in Cyprus than in Egypt.

=== Classical period ===
==== Byzantine Empire ====
Tabula (also called Alea, &quot;Tablē&quot; or &quot;Tάβλι&quot;), is the oldest identifiable tables game. It is described in an epigram of Byzantine Emperor Zeno (AD 476–491). It had the typical tables board layout with 24 rectangular points, 12 on each side. Each player had 15 men and used cubical dice with sides numbered one to six. The object of the game was to be the first to bear off all of one&#x27;s men. Modern Backgammon follows the similar rules to Tabula. The key differences being that Tabula uses an extra die (three rather than two), there is no doubling die or bar, and all the tablemen start off the board. Interestingly, the rules in Backgammon for re-entering pieces from the bar are the same as those in Tabula for entering pieces from off the board, along with those for hitting a blot, and bearing off. The name is still used for tables games in Greece, where they are frequently played in town plateias and cafes. The epigram of Zeno describes a particularly bad dice roll the emperor had for his given position. Zeno, who was white, had a stack of seven men, three stacks of two men and two blots, men that stood alone on a point and were therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opposing man. Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5 and 6. The rules meant that Zeno could not move to a space occupied by two opposing (black) men. The black and white tablemen were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three stacks of two men into blots, exposing them and ruining the game for Zeno.

==== Roman Empire ====

The of Zeno&#x27;s time is believed to be a direct descendant of the earlier Roman &quot;Ludus duodecim scriptorum&quot; (&#x27;Game of Twelve Lines&#x27;) with the board&#x27;s middle row of points removed, and only the two outer rows remaining. used a board with three rows of 12 points each, with the 15 men being moved in opposing directions by the two players across three rows according to the roll of the three cubical dice. Little specific text about the play of has survived; it may have been related to the older Ancient Greek dice game &quot;Kubeia&quot;. The earliest known mention of the game is in Ovid&#x27;s (&#x27;The Art of Love&#x27;), written between 1 BC and 8 AD. In Roman times, this game was also known as &quot;Alea&quot;, and a likely apocryphal Latin story linked this name, and the game, to a Trojan soldier named Alea.
=== Nard period (Middle Ages) ===
==== Middle East ====

In the 11th century Shahnameh, the Persian poet Ferdowsi credits Borzuya with the invention of the game of Nard in the 6th century. He describes an encounter between Borzuya and a Raja visiting from India. The Raja introduces the game of chess, and Borzuya demonstrates Nard, played with dice made from ivory and teak.

Meanwhile, Persian tradition places the invention of nard in the 3rd or even 6th century AD. The name of the game nard is an abbreviated version of the original Persian name &quot;nardšir&quot;. The Middle-Persian text, &quot;Kār-nāmag ī Ardaxšēr ī Pāpakān&quot;, associates the invention of nard with Ardashir I (r. 224–41), the founder of the Sasanian dynasty, whereas in the Middle Persian narrative &quot;Wičārišn ī čatrang ud nihišn ī nēw-ardaxšēr&quot; (Explanation of Chess and the Invention of Nardshir) it is Bozorgmehr Bokhtagan, the vizier of Khosrow I (r. 531–79), who is credited with the invention of the game.

==== East Asia ====

Nard was popular in China for a time and was known as &quot;shuanglu&quot; (, ). Shuanglu came from western India to China during the Wei dynasty and was a significant table game during the Liang, Chen, Sui, Tang, and Qi dynasties. The book () written during the Southern Song period (1127–1279) recording over ten variants. Over time it was replaced by other games such as &quot;xiangqi&quot; (Chinese chess).

In Japan, &quot;ban-sugoroku&quot; is thought to have been brought from China in the 6th century, and is mentioned in Genji monogatari. As a gambling game, it was made illegal several times. In the early Edo era, a new and fast gambling game called &quot;Chō-han&quot; appeared and &quot;sugoroku&quot; quickly dwindled. By the 13th century, the board game Go, originally played only by the aristocracy, had become popular among the general public.

In Korea, a similar game exists known as .

==== Europe ====

In English, the word &quot;tables&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;tabula&quot;. Its first use referring to board games documented by the Oxford English Dictionary was circa AD 700.

The Gloucester tabula set, Discovered on the site of Gloucester Castle in 1983, with its obelisk shaped points provides a potential transitional phase between the Roman square points, and the triangular points that were common in the 13th century.

The (&#x27;Games of Tables&#x27;) first appeared in France during the 11th century and became a favorite pastime of gamblers. In 1254, Louis IX issued a decree prohibiting his court officials and subjects from playing. Tables games were played in Germany in the 12th century, and had reached Iceland by the 13th century. In Spain, the Alfonso X manuscript , completed in 1283, describes rules for a number of dice and table games in addition to its extensive discussion of chess. Tables games were played in Germany in the 12th century, and had reached Iceland by the 13th century.

In 1254, Louis IX issued a decree prohibiting his court officials and subjects from playing dice games.

Mediaeval tables should not be confused with &quot;Tafl&quot;, an unrelated class of board games (albeit linguistically related) played in medieval Scandinavia. Tâb and tablan (as well as the related games sáhkku and daldøs) may, on the other hand, be descendants of tabula.

=== Modern period ===
==== Europe ====
By the 17th century, table games had spread to Sweden. A wooden board and counters were recovered from the wreck of the &quot;Vasa&quot; among the belongings of the ship&#x27;s officers. Tables games appear widely in paintings of this period, mainly those of Dutch and German painters, such as Van Ostade, Jan Steen, Hieronymus Bosch, and Bruegel. Some surviving artworks are &quot;Cardsharps&quot; by Caravaggio (the tables board is in the lower left) and &quot;The Triumph of Death&quot; by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (the tables board is in the lower right). Others include &quot;Hell&quot; (Bosch) and by Jan Steen.
==== The rise of Backgammon ====
The earliest known mention of Backgammon was in a letter dated 1635 and it was a variant of the popular mediaeval Anglo-Scottish game of Irish. By the 19th century it had superseded other tables games in popularity and spread abroad to Europe and America. The scoring rules have changed over time and a doubling cube added that enables players to raise the stakes.

Backgammon&#x27;s predecessor was the tables game of Irish, which was popular at the Scottish court of James IV and considered &quot;the more serious and solid game&quot; when Backgammon began to emerge in the first half of the 17th century. In the 16th century, Elizabethan laws and church regulations had prohibited playing tables in England, but by the 18th century, tables games were on the rise again and Backgammon had superseded Irish and become popular among the English clergy. Edmond Hoyle published &quot;A Short Treatise on the Game of Back-Gammon&quot; in 1753; this described rules and strategy for the game and was bound together with a similar text on whist.

In English, the word &quot;backgammon&quot; is most likely derived from &quot;back&quot; and , meaning &quot;game&quot; or &quot;play&quot;. The earliest mention of the game, which was under the name of &quot;Baggammon&quot;, was by James Howell in a letter dated 1635. Meanwhile, the first use documented by the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1650. In 1666, it is reported that the &quot;old name for backgammon used by Shakespeare and others&quot; was Tables. However, it is clear from Willughby that &quot;tables&quot; was a generic name and that the phrase &quot;playing at tables&quot; was used in a similar way to &quot;playing at cards&quot;.The most recent major development in backgammon was the addition of the doubling cube. It was first introduced in the 1920s in New York City among members of gaming clubs in the Lower East Side. The cube required players not only to select the best move in a given position, but also to estimate the probability of winning from that position, transforming backgammon into the expected value-driven game played in the 20th and 21st centuries.
The popularity of backgammon surged in the mid-1960s, in part due to the charisma of Prince Alexis Obolensky who became known as &quot;The Father of Modern Backgammon&quot;. &quot;Obe&quot;, as he was called by friends, co-founded the International Backgammon Association, which published a set of official rules. He also established the World Backgammon Club of Manhattan, devised a backgammon tournament system in 1963, then organized the first major international backgammon tournament in March 1964, which attracted royalty, celebrities and the press. The game became a huge fad and was played on college campuses, in discothèques and at country clubs; stockbrokers and bankers began playing at conservative men&#x27;s clubs. People young and old all across the country dusted off their boards and &#x27;checkers&#x27;. Cigarette, liquor and car companies began to sponsor tournaments, and Hugh Hefner held backgammon parties at the Playboy Mansion. Backgammon clubs were formed and tournaments were held, resulting in a World Championship promoted in Las Vegas in 1967.

Most recently, the United States Backgammon Federation (USBGF) was organized in 2009 to re-popularize the game in the United States. Board and committee members include many of the top players, tournament directors and writers in the worldwide backgammon community. The USBGF has recently created a Standards of Ethical Practice to address issues which tournament rules fail to touch.

== Tables games by region ==
=== Europe ===

==== France ====
Trictrac was the classic French tables game of the 17th and 18th centuries in the same way that backgammon that now is in the English-speaking world. There are two main forms of the game, &quot;le Grand Trictrac&quot; and &quot;le Petit Trictrac.&quot; However, it is not a race game; rather the main aim is to score points.

In Trictrac, the starting point is called a &quot;talon&quot;, the points, or &quot;fleches&quot;, are numbered to 12 on both sides of the board, with the 12th point on either side called the &quot;coin de repos&quot;, or, simply, &quot;coin&quot;. The 11th point (on either side) is often called &quot;le case d&#x27;écolier&quot;, or &#x27;schoolboy&#x27;s point&#x27; (&quot;case&quot; meaning &#x27;square&#x27;, literally) after the tendency of inexperienced players to rush to this point too soon in the game. Statistically, the most difficult points in the game to reach aside from the &quot;coins&quot; are the 8th points, and they are named &quot;les fleches de diable&quot;, or &#x27;the Devil&#x27;s points&#x27;, for this reason. The home boards are referred to as the &quot;jan de retour&quot; by either player. Doubles are treated as two identical numbers.

Trictrac was superseded by the much simpler game of Jacquet during the 19th century, a race game with a number of distinctive features. First, players circulated the board in the same direction rather than in opposing directions. Second, players could not move the majority of their pieces until the first piece, the &#x27;courier&#x27; or &#x27;postilion&#x27;, had reached the final quadrant. Jacquet was largely ousted by Anglo-American games in the 1960s, but its rules are still published and boards are still manufactured.

Tourne Case is another old French tables game and more one of chance than skill. Using a tables board, each player only takes 3 pieces. The aim is to enter them onto the board using the throws of the dice and be first to move all 3 to the &#x27;home corner&#x27; (&quot;coin de repos&quot;) on the 12th point of the board. The men may not pass over one another nor may there be more than one on a point except in the home corner. If a man moves to a point opposite that of an opposing man, the latter is &#x27;hit&#x27;. It must be removed from the board and re-entered from the start.
====Greece and Cyprus====
Tables games are popular among the Greeks. These games are called Tavli, derived in Byzantine times from the Latin word . A game of the tables family called Tavli (Byzantine Greek: ) is described in an epigram of the Byzantine Emperor Zeno (AD 476–481). The games of Tavli most commonly played are:

* Portes has no doubling cube, and players only win double (called &quot;diplo&quot;, Greek for &quot;double&quot;), not triple, when a player bears off all the counters while the opponent has yet to bear off any and has still counters on the winner&#x27;s home board or on the bar.
* Plakoto is very similar to Mahbusa or tapa. It has some general similarities with Portes, but with a different opening layout of the pieces and blots are pinned (so they cannot move) instead of being hit.
* Fevga is similar to Narde or the Turkish variant Moultezim. It is a running game of parallel movement; players moving in the same direction. There is not hitting or pinning and a point is blocked to the opponent even when occupied by a single piece.

The three games are normally played consecutively, in three-, five- or seven-point matches. Before starting a match, each player rolls 1 die, and the player with the highest roll picks up both dice and re-rolls (i.e. it is possible to roll doubles for the opening move). Players use the same pair of dice in turns. After the first game, the winner of the previous game starts first. Each game counts as 1 point, if the opponent has borne off at least 1 stone, otherwise 2 points. There is no doubling cube. Tavli is considered the national board game of Cyprus and Greece.

Other Greek tables games include:
* Gul or Multezim is Fevga with the feature that, on a double, one has to play all doubles subsequently till the 6–6. If a dice throw cannot be fulfilled in any way, his opponent takes the turn for the remaining moves of that throw.
* Asodio is a game where all pieces are off the board at the outset and players enter either by rolling doubles or an Ace-Deuce combination.
* Sfaktes means &quot;slayers&quot;. 
* Evraiko (Jewish), a much simpler game depending entirely on luck with no room for skill.

====Romania====
In Romania, &quot;tablă&quot; (meaning &quot;board&quot;, cognate of the Latin &quot;tabula&quot;) has two variations: there is no doubling cube and a backgammon counts only as a gammon (called &quot;marț&quot;). Matches are usually played to three points.

====Sweden====

Bräde or svenskt brädspel (&quot;Swedish Tables&quot;) is an elaborate version of the historical game verquere that is played in Sweden. Players start with all 15 of their counters on opposite corners of the board, and play around counter-clockwise. Besides bearing off, there are several other ways to win, such as arranging all of one&#x27;s counters in certain pre-determined patterns, or by hitting so many counters that one&#x27;s opponent can not bring them in again. Additional points are awarded for a victory while one&#x27;s opponent has counters on the bar. Brädspel is played without the doubling cube. Interest in brädspel experienced a resurgence following the recovery of a 17th-century board from the wreck of the Vasa.

=== Far East ===

There are two games known as &quot;sugoroku&quot; (双六) in Japan. One more closely resembles Snakes and Ladders, while the other is played on a 24-point tables board, using standard tables equipment. The starting position is identical to that of backgammon, however it differs from most other tables variants in that the pieces are never borne off. Additionally, the use of primes is not permitted.

===Middle East and Central Asia===
Tables games are played widely in the Middle East and Central Asia. The most popular is known as &#x27; in Arabic (meaning &quot;table&quot;). This may represent a shared name origin with the Roman or Byzantine tables games. The game is called &#x27; in Iran. In Israel and many Arabic-speaking countries, it is known as Shesh Besh (pronounced Sheesh Beesh in Arabic), which is a rhyming combination &quot;shesh&quot;, meaning six in Hebrew, Aramaic and Northwest Semitic, and &quot;besh&quot;, meaning five in Turkish). It is also played by some Kurdish, Persian and Turkish speakers. &quot;Shesh besh&quot; is commonly used to refer to when a player scores a 5 and 6 at the same time on dice.

The name Nardshir comes from the Persian &quot;nard&quot; (Wooden block) and &quot;shir&quot; (lion) referring to the two type of pieces used in play. A common legend associates the game with the founder of the Sassanian dynasty, Ardashir I. The oldest known reference to the game is thought to be a passage in the Talmud.

&quot;Mahbusa&quot; means &quot;imprisoned&quot;. Each player begins with 15 counters on his opponent&#x27;s 24-point. If a counter is hit, it is not placed on the bar, but instead, the hitting piece is placed on top, and the point is then controlled by the hitting player. The counter which has been hit is &#x27;imprisoned&#x27; and cannot be moved until the opponent removes his piece. Sometimes, a rule is used that requires a player to bring his first counter around to his home board before moving any others. In any case, a rapid advance to one&#x27;s own home board is desirable, as imprisoning the opponent&#x27;s counter there is highly advantageous. Mahbusa is similar to &quot;tapa&quot;.

&quot;Tawla 31&quot; (meaning table 31) or &quot;Maghribiyya&quot; (meaning &quot;Moroccan&quot;). Similar to Mahbusa, each player begins with 15 counters on the opponent&#x27;s 24-point. However, this game involves neither hitting not pinning. Instead, one or more pieces on a point act as a block. Moreover, a player must initially advance only one counter to the opponent&#x27;s &#x27;home board&#x27; before being able to move additional pieces. Tawla 31 or Maghribiyya is similar to &quot;Fevga&quot;.

Many of the early Arabic texts which refer to the game comment on the debate regarding the legality and morality of playing the game. This debate was settled by the eighth century when all four Muslim schools of jurisprudence declared the game to be Haraam (forbidden), however the game is still played today in many Arab countries.

In the modern Middle East, tables games are a common feature of coffeehouses. Today they continue to be commonly played in various forms in Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Jordan and throughout the Arab world.

A feature of tables play in some Arab countries is that Persian numbers, rather than Arabic ones, are called out by a player announcing his dice rolls.

====Armenia====
Nardi () is very popular among Armenians. The word is derived from Persian word (). There are two games of Nardi commonly played:

Short Nardi: the local name for Backgammon; same setup and rules.

Long Nardi: A game that starts with all fifteen pieces are placed in a line on the 24-point and on the 11-point. The two players move their pieces in parallel directions, from the 24-point towards the 1-point, or home board. In Long Nardi, one piece by itself can block a point. There is no hitting in Long Nardi. The objective of the game is bearing all pieces off the board, and there is no doubling cube.

==== Iran ====
Nard is the name for the Persian tables game. H. J. R. Murray details many versions of tables games; his description of modern Persian &quot;Nard&quot; has the same layout and scheme of movement as backgammon. He suggests that it may date back, perhaps in an older form, to 300–500 AD in the Babylonian Talmud, although others believe the Talmud references the Greek race game &quot;Kubeia&quot;.

People in the Iranian plateau and Caucasus region, especially in Azerbaijan, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Uzbekistan and Russia, are very fond of playing narde. All 15 of a player&#x27;s counters are initially positioned on his own 24-point, but there is a major difference. One is forbidden to put his counter at a point occupied by one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s counter, so there is no hitting or imprisonment in the long narde game. The main strategy is to secure playing &quot;big pairs&quot; by one&#x27;s own counter and prevent as much as possible doing the same by the opponent.

The game is known as &#x27;Fevga&#x27; in Greece, &#x27;Moultezim&#x27; in Turkey, Mahbusa in the Middle East and &#x27;Ifranjiah&#x27; or &quot;Frankish&quot; in Arabia. It can also be spelt as &#x27;Nard&#x27; or &#x27;Nardi&#x27;.

A version known as &quot;short narde&quot; is a simplified form of Ifranjiah. In Georgia, ifranjiah is played as elsewhere, but called &quot;nardi&quot;. In Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia many experienced players also play long narde, which some see as requiring deeper strategy.

One of the most famous narde championships is the championship of Azerbaijan – Gizil Zar – Golden Dawn. The winner is awarded with gold dice.

Gul bara, sometimes referred to as &quot;Rosespring Backgammon&quot; or &quot;Crazy Narde&quot;, is a tables game in which there is no hitting.
==== Turkey ====
Tavla (from Medieval Greek τάβλη or from Arabic &quot;tawleh&quot;), is a very popular game in Turkey. It lacks a doubling cube, gammons and backgammons are counted as two points called &quot;mars&quot; and the players may not hit and run in their home boards. Matches are usually played to five points. It is customary to call the dice rolls their Persian number names, with local spellings: (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6).

There are many variants of Tavla in Turkey, where the course of play changes drastically. The usual tavla is also known as &quot;erkek tavlası&quot; (&quot;boys&#x27; tavla&quot; or &quot;men&#x27;s tavla&quot;). The other variant &quot;kız tavlası&quot; (&quot;girls&#x27; tavla&quot;) is a game which depends only on the dice and involves no strategy. There is another variant called &quot;asker tavlası&quot; (&quot;soldiers&#x27; tavla&quot;) where the pieces are thrown to the board randomly and the opponents try to flip their pieces over the opponents&#x27; pieces to beat them. The player with no pieces left loses the game. This variant doesn&#x27;t involve dice at all and the play depends more on hand-eye coordination than tactical decision making. &quot;Üniversite tavlası&quot; (&quot;university tavla&quot;) is a variant of the game played with two or more tavlas and four or more players, with the players forming groups. The dice are thrown only by two opposing players and the rest must play the same dice. If a team member gets beaten and cannot enter, his teammates cannot play for that round. Although the dice are the same, the game on every board differs, where the case of one team member winning and another losing is very common. This variant is considered much harder because the player must take more than one play into account while only being capable of making decisions on his own board.

Hapis (Turkish for &quot;prison&quot;) is another tables game played in Turkey. It is very similar to Mahbusa played in the Arab World.

<doc id="80001" wikidata="Q597887" url="?curid=80001" title="Shotacon">
<text>, abbreviated from , is, in Japanese contexts, the attraction to young (or young-looking) boy characters, or media centered around this attraction. The term refers to a genre of manga and anime wherein prepubescent or pubescent male characters are depicted in a suggestive or erotic manner, whether in the obvious role of object of attraction, or the less apparent role of &quot;subject&quot; (the character the reader is designed to associate with).

In some stories, the boy character is paired with an older boy or man, usually in a homoerotic manner, which is most common in yaoi works meant for female readers, but some of these works are male-oriented, such as &quot;Boku no Pico&quot;. In others, he is paired with a female, which the general community would call &quot;straight shota.&quot; In some works, the &quot;shota&quot; character is paired with an older girl or woman, which is known as &quot;oneshota&quot; (おねショタ), a blend of &quot;onē-san&quot; (お姉さん, older sister) and &quot;shota&quot;. It can also apply to post-pubescent (adolescent or adult) characters with neotenic features that would make them appear to be younger than they are. The phrase is a reference to the young male character from &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot; (reworked in English as &quot;Gigantor&quot;). The equivalent term for attraction to (or art pertaining to erotic portrayal of) young girls is lolicon.

The usage of the term in both Western and Japanese fan cultures includes works ranging from explicitly pornographic to mildly suggestive, romantic, or in rare cases, entirely nonsexual, in which case it is not usually classified as &quot;true&quot; shotacon. As with lolicon, shotacon is related to the concepts of &quot;kawaii&quot; (cuteness) and &quot;moe&quot; (in which characters are presented as young, cute or helpless in order to increase reader identification and inspire protective feelings). As such, shotacon themes and characters are used in a variety of children&#x27;s media. Elements of shotacon, like yaoi, are comparatively common in shōjo manga, such as the popular translated manga &quot;Loveless&quot;, which features an eroticized but unconsummated relationship between the 12-year-old male protagonist and a twenty-year-old male, or the young-appearing character Honey in &quot;Ouran High School Host Club&quot;. Seinen manga, primarily aimed at otaku, also occasionally presents eroticized adolescent males in a non-pornographic context, such as Yoshinori &quot;Yuki&quot; Ikeda, the cross-dressing 14-year-old boy in &quot;Yubisaki Milk Tea&quot;.

Some critics claim that the shotacon genre contributes to actual sexual abuse of children, while others claim that there is no evidence for this, or that there is evidence to the contrary.

==Origins==
The term &quot;shotacon&quot; is a Japanese contraction of , a reference to the young male character Shōtarō () from &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot;. In the anime and manga series, Shōtarō is a bold, self-assertive detective who frequently outwits his adversaries and helps to solve cases. Throughout the series, Shōtarō develops close friends within the world. His cuteness embodied and formed the term &quot;shotacon&quot;, putting a name to an old sexual subculture. The word &quot;shotacon&quot; itself was coined in the magazine &quot;Fan Road&quot; in 1981.

Where the shotacon concept developed is hard to pinpoint, but some of its earliest roots are in reader responses to detective series written by Edogawa Rampo. In his works, a character named Yoshio Kobayashi of &quot;Shōnentanteidan&quot; (Junior Detective Group, similar to the Baker Street Irregulars of Sherlock Holmes) forms a deep dependency with adult protagonist Kogoro Akechi. Kobayashi, a beautiful teenager, constantly concerns himself with Kogoro&#x27;s cases and well-being, and for a time moves in with the unmarried man. This nonsexual but intimate adult-boy relationship in part inspired the evolution of the shotacon community.

Tamaki Saitō writes that although the modern shotacon audience has a roughly even split between males and females, the genre is rumored to have roots in early 1980s dōjinshi as an offshoot of yaoi. Saitō suggests that shotacon was adopted by male readers who were influenced by lolicon; thus, he claims &quot;&quot;shota&quot; texts by female &quot;yaoi&quot; authors are structurally identical to &quot;yaoi&quot; texts, while &quot;shota&quot; by male &quot;otaku&quot; clearly position these little boys as young girls with penises&quot;. Kaoru Nagayama writes that the 1995 manga anthology &quot;U.C. BOYS: Under Cover Boys&quot; started a boom in commercial shotacon in the second half of the 1990s. During this time, male-oriented shotacon emerged and mixed with female-oriented shotacon: &quot;the situation was such that shota works targeting women, men and a combination of both were all in close proximity.&quot; The boom collapsed at the end of the 1990s, but male-targeted shotacon saw a small resurgence starting in 2002.

==Shotacon publications==

Shotacon stories are commonly released in semi-monthly anthologies. Sometimes, however, manga artist will publish individual manga volumes. Many shotacon stories are published as dōjinshi; , an annual convention to sell shotacon doujin material, was founded in 1995, by a group of male creators. The 2008 Shotaket had over 1000 attendees and offered work from nearly 200 circles.

Shotacon for women is almost exclusively yaoi, and may be published in general yaoi anthology magazines or in one of the few exclusively shotacon yaoi anthologies, such as &quot;Shōnen Romance&quot;. Because of the possible legal issues, US publishers of yaoi have avoided material depicting notably underage characters. In 2006, Juné released an English translation of Mako Takahashi&#x27;s under the title &quot;Almost Crying&quot;, a non-erotic shotacon manga; the book contains several stories featuring pubescent male characters, but their relationships are nonsexual.

Shotacon for male readers may feature either homosexual or heterosexual relationships. Both gay and straight shotacon typically involve escapades between smaller, often pubescent males and young adults (older brother/sister figures), sexually frustrated authority figures (teacher/boss), significantly older &quot;uncle/aunt&quot; figures (neighborhood acquaintances, actual family members), or outright father or mother figures (adopted, step, or full blood relation). Outside of these tropes, stories that involve only young boys (with no older characters) are not rare, with the most common recurring theme being a classmate relation.

Shota stories may be published in (a subset of) general seijin (men&#x27;s pornographic) manga anthologies or in the few seijin shota manga anthologies, such as &quot;Shōnen Ai no Bigaku&quot;, which specializes in male-male stories. Some gay men&#x27;s magazines which offer a particularly broad mix of pornographic material occasionally run stories or manga featuring peri-pubescent characters.

In 2006, the seijin shotacon OVA anime , which the producer has described as the first shotacon anime, was released. It was later followed by two sequels and an edited version of the first OVA, with content more suitable for viewers under 18, as well as a video game starring Pico and Chico, the main characters of the anime. However, an OVA based on the eroge &quot;&quot; was created in 2004, featuring explicit sexual acts involving young boys, and the OVA for Akira Gotō&#x27;s &quot;A Forbidden Time&quot; dates back to 2000.

<text>A satrap () was a governor of the provinces of the ancient Median and Persian (Achaemenid) Empires and in several of their successors, such as in the Sasanian Empire and the Hellenistic empires. A satrapy is the territory governed by a satrap.

A satrap served as a viceroy to the king, though with considerable autonomy. The word came to suggest tyranny or ostentatious splendour, and its modern usage is a pejorative and refers to any subordinate or local ruler, usually with unfavourable connotations of corruption.

==Etymology==
The word is derived via Latin from Greek (), itself borrowed from an Old Iranian . In Old Persian, which was the native language of the Achaemenids, it is recorded as (, literally &quot;protector of the province&quot;). The Median form is reconstructed as . Its Sanskrit cognate is (). The Biblical Hebrew form is , as found in Esther 3:12.

In the Parthian (language of the Arsacid Empire) and Middle Persian (the language of the Sassanian Empire), it is recorded in the forms and , respectively.

In modern Persian the descendant of is (), but the components have undergone semantic shift so the word now means &quot;town keeper&quot; ( meaning &quot;town&quot; + meaning &quot;keeper&quot;).

==History==

===Medo-Persian===
Although the first large-scale use of satrapies, or provinces, originates from the inception of the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great, beginning at around 530BCE, provincial organization actually originated during the Median era from at least 648BCE.

Up to the time of the conquest of Media by Cyrus the Great, emperors ruled the lands they conquered through client kings and governors. The main difference was that in Persian culture the concept of kingship was indivisible from divinity: divine authority validated the divine right of kings. The twenty-six satraps established by Cyrus were never kings, but viceroys ruling in the king&#x27;s name. However, in political reality many took advantage of any opportunity to carve out an independent power base for themselves. Darius the Great gave the satrapies a definitive organization, increased their number to thirty-six, and fixed their annual tribute (Behistun inscription).
The satrap was in charge of the land that he owned as an administrator, and found himself surrounded by an all-but-royal court; he collected the taxes, controlled the local officials and the subject tribes and cities, and was the supreme judge of the province before whose &quot;chair&quot; (&quot;Nehemiah&quot;3:7) every civil and criminal case could be brought. He was responsible for the safety of the roads (cf.Xenophon), and had to put down brigands and rebels.

He was assisted by a council of Persians, to which also provincials were admitted and which was controlled by a royal secretary and emissaries of the king, especially the &quot;eye of the king&quot;, who made an annual inspection and exercised permanent control.
There were further checks on the power of each satrap: besides his secretarial scribe, his chief financial official (Old Persian &quot;ganzabara&quot;) and the general in charge of the regular army of his province and of the fortresses were independent of him and periodically reported directly to the &quot;shah&quot;, in person. The satrap was allowed to have troops in his own service.

The great satrapies (provinces) were often divided into smaller districts, the governors of which were also called satraps and (by Greco-Roman authors) also called &quot;hyparchs&quot; (actually &quot;Hyparkhos&quot; in Greek, &#x27;vice-regents&#x27;). The distribution of the great satrapies was changed repeatedly, and often two of them were given to the same man.
As the provinces were the result of consecutive conquests (the homeland had a special status, exempt from provincial tribute), both primary and sub-satrapies were often defined by former states and/or ethno-religious identity. One of the keys to the Achaemenid success was their open attitude to the culture and religion of the conquered people, so the Persian culture was the one most affected as the Great King endeavoured to meld elements from all his subjects into a new imperial style, especially at his capital, Persepolis.
Whenever central authority in the empire weakened, the satrap often enjoyed practical independence, especially as it became customary to appoint him also as general-in-chief of the army district, contrary to the original rule. &quot;When his office became hereditary, the threat to the central authority could not be ignored&quot; (Olmstead). Rebellions of satraps became frequent from the middle of the 5thcentury BCE. Darius I struggled with widespread rebellions in the satrapies, and under Artaxerxes II occasionally the greater parts of Asia Minor and Syria were in open rebellion (Revolt of the Satraps).

The last great rebellions were put down by Artaxerxes III.

===Seleucid===

The satrapic administration and title were retained—even for Greco-Macedonian incumbents—by Alexander the Great, who conquered the Achaemenid Empire, and by his successors, the Diadochi (and their dynasties) who carved it up, especially in the Seleucid Empire, where the satrap generally was designated as &quot;strategos&quot; (in other words, military generals); but their provinces were much smaller than under the Persians. They would ultimately be replaced by conquering empires, especially the Parthians.

===Parthian and Sassanian===
In the Parthian Empire, the king&#x27;s power rested on the support of noble families, who ruled large estates and supplied soldiers and tribute to the king. City-states within the empire enjoyed a degree of self-government, and paid tribute to the king. Administration of the Sassanid Empire was considerably more centralized than that of the Parthian Empire; the semi-independent kingdoms and self-governing city states of the Parthian Empire were replaced with a system of &quot;royal cities&quot; which served as the seats of centrally appointed governors called &quot;shahrabs&quot; as well as the location of military garrisons. &quot;Shahrabs&quot; ruled both the city and the surrounding rural districts. Exceptionally, the Byzantine Empire also adopted the title &quot;satrap&quot; for the semi-autonomous princes that governed one of its Armenian provinces, the &quot;Satrapiae&quot;.

===Indian===
The Western Satraps or Kshatrapas (35–405 CE) of the Indian subcontinent were Saka rulers in the western and central part of the Sindh region of Pakistan, and the Saurashtra and Malwa regions of western India. They were contemporaneous with the Kushans, who ruled the northern part of the subcontinent from the area of Peshawar and were possibly their overlords, and with the Satavahana, who ruled in central India to their south and east and the Kushan state to their immediate west.

<text>A chief financial officer (CFO) is an officer of a company or organization who is assigned the primary responsibility for making decisions for the company for projects and its finances; i.a.: financial planning, management of financial risks, record-keeping, and financial reporting, and, increasingly, the analysis of data.
The CFO thus has ultimate authority over the finance unit and is the chief financial spokesperson for the organization.

The CFO typically reports to the chief executive officer (CEO) and the board of directors and may additionally have a seat on the board. The CFO directly assists the chief operating officer (COO) on all business matters relating to budget management, cost–benefit analysis, forecasting needs, and securing of new funding. Some CFOs have the title CFOO for chief financial and operating officer. In the majority of countries, finance directors (FD) typically report into the CFO, and FD is the level before reaching CFO.

==Legal requirement==
The appointment of a CFO or FD may be mandated by law. For example, in India, per the provisions of Section 203 of Companies Act 2013 every publicly listed firm having a paid up share capital of Rs. 10 Crores, requires a full time CFO. In the government sector this may be specified also: The US Chief Financial Officers Act, enacted in 1990, created a CFO in each of 23 federal agencies. (See also Office of Management and Budget and Office of Federal Financial Management.)

==Role==
The chief financial officer was traditionally viewed as a financial &quot;gatekeeper&quot;. 
Over time, the position has become one of an advisor and strategic partner to the CEO. 
According to one source, &quot;The CFO of tomorrow should be a big-picture thinker, rather than detail-oriented, outspoken rather than reserved, prefer to delegate rather than be hands-on, emphasize what gets done rather than how things are done, and make collaborative rather than unilateral decisions&quot;. 
The duties of a modern CFO, therefore, now straddle the traditional areas of financial stewardship, as well as the more progressive areas of strategic- and business leadership, with increasingly direct responsibility and oversight of operations. 
This significant role-based transformation is best-evidenced by the &quot;CEO-in-Waiting&quot; status that many CFOs now hold. 

Here, CEOs increasingly expect their CFOs to be active participants in shaping the strategy of their organizations, including challenging the current strategy.
CFOs thus play a critical role in shaping their company&#x27;s strategies today, especially in light of the highly uncertain macroeconomic environments, where managing financial volatilities is a centerpiece for many companies&#x27; strategies. 
Indeed, the 1990s saw the rise of the strategic CFO, and many companies have created a chief strategy officer (CSO) position.
See also Strategic financial management.

The CFO is then as much a part of governance and oversight as the CEO, playing a fundamental role in the development and critique of strategic choices. 
Relatedly The CFO is expected to be a key player in stockholder education and communication and is clearly seen as a leader and team builder who sets the financial agenda for the organization, supports the CEO directly and provides timely advice to the board of directors.&quot;

The rise of digital technologies and focus on data analytics to support decision-making, places more pressure on CFOs to meet the expectations of their C-Suite colleagues. 
Many organizations have created a finance function based on four pillars: 
# the accounting organization as a shared service 
# an FP&amp;A organization responsible for driving financial planning processes as well as increased insight into financial and non financial KPIs to boost business performance
# a finance business partnering organization based on leadership of divisions, regions and performance improvement 
# expertise centers specializing in Tax, Treasury, Internal Audit, Investor Relations, etc.

CFOs are increasingly being relied upon as the owners of business information, reporting and financial data within organizations - thereby also assisting in decision support operations to enable the company to operate more effectively and efficiently.
The CFO must then serve as the financial authority in the organization, ensuring the integrity of data, and modeling transparency and accountability. 
CFOs have then become more focused on financial reporting, although (as of 2016) a majority still spend much of their time in traditional accounting tasks such as transaction reporting. 

Additionally, many CFOs have made the realization that an operating environment that values cash, profit margins, and risk mitigation is one that plays to the primary skills and capabilities of a procurement organization; CFO&#x27;s have been encouraged to appoint a chief procurement officer (CPO) where this post does not exist, ensure the post-holder is accountable for procurement success, and to become increasingly involved (directly via oversight or indirectly through improved collaboration) with the procurement function according to several research reports which have looked at the CFO&#x27;s relationship with the procurement function and the CPO.

==Qualifications==

CFOs and FDs often hold a professional accounting qualification - the CPA, CA, CMA, or CIMA - along with its requisite bachelors and/or masters in accounting. The certification is specified given that responsibilities extend to tax and financial reporting. Similarly, financial managers are often qualified accountants.

In large companies, CFOs and FDs may hold additional postgraduate qualifications, such as a Master of Business Administration, 
or Master of Science in Finance; the Chartered Financial Analyst is also common. These complement the accounting perspective with more general strategic, leadership and financial market considerations, and give exposure to broader financial and operational issues.

<doc id="80018" wikidata="Q28453679" url="?curid=80018" title="Outline of meals">
<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to meals:

[[Meal]] – eating occasion that takes place at a certain time and includes specific, prepared food, or the food eaten on that occasion. The names used for specific meals in English vary greatly, depending on the speaker&#x27;s culture, the time of day, or the size of the meal. Meals occur primarily at homes, restaurants, and cafeterias, but may occur anywhere. Regular meals occur on a daily basis, typically several times a day. Special meals are usually held in conjunction with such occasions as birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, and holidays. A meal is different from a snack in that meals are generally larger, more varied, and more filling than snacks. Meals are composed of one or more courses, which in turn are composed of one or more dishes.

== Types of meals ==

=== 3 main meals of the day ===

* Breakfast – eaten within an hour or two after a person wakes in the morning. (Index)
** Full breakfast – 
** Midnight breakfast –
* Lunch – eaten around mid-day, usually between 11 am and 3 pm. In some areas, the name for this meal depends on its content.
** Box lunch – Lunch that is packed in a box (in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth nations, this is known as a Packed Lunch, especially when in reference to a lunch taken to the workplace or place of education)
* Tea – Drank in the evening. In some areas, the name for this meal depends on its content, but many English-speakers use &quot;supper&quot; or &quot;Dinner&quot; for this meal, regardless of size.
** Dinner party –
** Full course dinner – in its simplest form, it can consist of three or four courses, such as soup, salad, main course and dessert. In formal dining, a full course dinner can consist of many courses, and in some instances the courses are carefully planned to complement each other gastronomically.

=== Types of meals, in the order served throughout the day ===

* Breakfast – meal eaten in the morning, usually before 10:00 am. Later meals can involve breakfast food but are usually not considered breakfast.
* Second breakfast – small meal eaten after breakfast, but before lunch. It is traditional in Bavaria, in Poland, and in Hungary. In Bavaria or Poland, special dishes are made exclusively to be eaten during second breakfast. In Vienna and most other parts of Austria the second breakfast is referred to as &quot;Jause&quot;.
** Tiffin – second breakfast or light lunch, most commonly in India. &quot;Tiffin&quot; can also refer to boxed or packaged lunches eaten outside the home, such as those that are delivered by dabbawalas in Mumbai to workers in the city.
* Brunch – combination of breakfast and lunch eaten usually during the late morning but it can extend to as late as 3 pm. The word is a portmanteau of &quot;breakfast&quot; and &quot;lunch&quot;. It is usually larger than a breakfast and usually replacing both breakfast and lunch; it is most common on Sundays. Brunch originated in England in the late 1800s, and in the 1930s became popular in the United States.
* Elevenses (also called &quot;morning tea&quot;) – light snack and drink taken in the late morning after breakfast and before lunch.
* Lunch – midday meal of varying size depending on the culture. The origin of the words lunch and luncheon relate to a small meal originally eaten at any time of the day or night, but during the 20th century gradually focused toward a small or mid-sized meal eaten at midday. Lunch is the second meal of the day after breakfast. Luncheon is now considered a formal lunch.
*Tea – any of several different meals or mealtimes, depending on a country&#x27;s customs and its history of drinking tea. However, in those countries where the term&#x27;s use is common, the influences are generally those of the former British Empire (now the Commonwealth of Nations). Tea as a meal can be small or large.
:* Afternoon tea – mid-afternoon meal, typically taken at 4 pm, consisting of light fare such as small sandwiches, individual cakes and scones with tea.

:* High tea – British meal usually eaten in the early evening.
* Linner/Lupper/Dunch/Dinch –- Not in general use. Linner is a late lunch or almost dinner meal. The name comes in reference to brunch, being a combination of the words &quot;lunch&quot; and &quot;dinner&quot; or &quot;supper.&quot; Dunch comes in reference to brunch, being a combination of &quot;dinner and &quot;lunch.&quot; An alternate historical term is &quot;Russin.&quot;
* Dinner – Usually the largest and most elaborate meal of the day, which can replace either lunch, high tea, or supper. However, the term &quot;dinner&quot; can have many different meanings depending on the culture; it may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of day. Historically, in British culture, dinner was taken at midday for children and manual workers; in the early evening for office workers; and in the late evening by the wealthier elements of society. During the latter half of the 20th century there has been a cultural shift towards everyone having the main meal in the late evening. The meaning as the evening meal, now generally the largest of the day, is becoming standard in most parts of the English-speaking world.
* Supper – light meal eaten in the late evening; as early as 7pm or as late as midnight. Usually eaten when the main meal of the day is taken at lunchtime or high tea.
* High Tea - a light meal consisting of tea, bread, vegetables, cheese and occasionally meat. Variations on high tea could include the addition of pies, potatoes and crackers. High tea is generally eaten late in the evening from around 8pm
* Siu yeh – late-night or overnight meal usually after dinner, may start anywhere from 9 pm onwards to 4 am. It is popular in Hong Kong, Taiwan, some parts of southern mainland China and amongst students in India.
* Midnight snack / Feast – late-night or early morning meal popular in the United States among people with pre-sleep hunger pangs, late-night revelers, and insomniacs. Sometimes called &#x27;fourth meal&#x27;, a name introduced by Taco Bell aimed towards gamers and stoners who are often afflicted by late hour cravings or &#x27;the munchies.&#x27;

A course may include multiple dishes or only one, and often includes items with some variety of flavors. For instance, a hamburger served with fries would be considered a single course, and most likely the entire meal. &quot;See also full course dinner.&quot;
*** Hors d&#x27;oeuvre – literally &quot;apart from the [main] work&quot;) or the first course, is a food item served before the main courses of a meal, typically smaller than main dishes, and often meant to be eaten by hand (with minimal use of cutlery). Hors d&#x27;oeuvres may be served at the dinner table as a part of the meal, or they may be served before seating.
*** Entrée – dish served before the main course, or between two principal courses of a meal.
*** Main course – featured or primary dish in a meal consisting of several courses. It usually follows the entrée (&quot;entry&quot;) course. In the United States and parts of Canada, it may be called &quot;entrée.&quot;
*** Dessert – typically sweet course that concludes an evening meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods, but may include other items. In world cultures there are a wide variety of desserts including cakes, tarts, cookies, biscuits, gelatins, pastries, ice creams, pies, puddings, custards, and sweet soups. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness.
** Dishes – specific food preparation, a &quot;distinct article or variety of food&quot;, with cooking finished, and ready to eat, or be served. A &quot;dish&quot; may be served on tableware, or may be eaten out of hand; but breads are generally not called &quot;dishes.&quot;
*** Types of dishes
**** Entrée – dish served before the main course, or between two principal courses of a meal.
**** Side dish – food item that accompanies the entrée or main course at a meal.
*** Styles of dishes
**** National dish – culinary dish that is strongly associated with a particular country., and are part of a nation&#x27;s identity and self-image. A dish can be considered a national dish for a variety of reasons:

***** It contains a particular &#x27;exotic&#x27; ingredient that is produced locally, such as the South American paprika grown in the European Pyrenees.
***** It is served as a festive culinary tradition that forms part of a cultural heritage—for example, barbecues at summer camp or fondue at dinner parties—or as part of a religious practice such as Korban Pesach or Iftar celebrations.
** Bread – staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking. Throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods, having been of importance since the dawn of agriculture. &quot;See List of breads.&quot;
** Garnishes – items or substances used as a decoration or embellishment accompanying a prepared food dish or drink. In many cases, it may give added or contrasting flavor. Some garnishes are selected mainly to augment the visual impact of the plate, while others are selected specifically for the flavor they may impart.
** Condiments – spice, sauce or other food preparation that is added to foods to impart a particular flavor, enhance its flavor, or in some cultures, to complement the dish. &quot;See List of condiments.&quot;

<doc id="80019" wikidata="Q676203" url="?curid=80019" title="Machu Picchu">
<text>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a mountain ridge at . Often referred to as the &quot;Lost City of the Incas&quot;, it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within the Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is northwest of the city of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a subtropical mountain climate.

The Inca civilization had no written language and following the first encounter by the Spanish soldier Baltasar Ocampo, no Europeans are recorded to have visited the site from the late 16th century until the 19th century. As far as historical knowledge extends, there are no existing written records detailing the site during its period of active use. The leading theory is that Machu Picchu was a private city for Incan royalty. The names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants, are the product of modern archaeologists based on physical evidence, including tombs at the site. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the &quot;Temple of the Sun&quot;, the &quot;Temple of the Three Windows,&quot; and the &quot;Intihuatana&quot;. From 1929 to 1971, Machu Picchu underwent extensive restoration and conservation work, including structural stabilization and artifact excavation, driven by government initiatives and research expeditions. Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). The Inca built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied from 1420–1532. Historical research published in 2022 claims that the site was probably called Huayna Picchu by the Inca people themselves, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same name.

Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1982 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.

==Etymology==
The site is on a narrow saddle between two mountain peaks, Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu. In the Quechua language, means &quot;old&quot; or &quot;old person&quot; and (spelled &quot;huayna&quot; in standard Spanish orthography) means &quot;young&quot;, while refers to a &quot;summit,&quot; &quot;peak,&quot; or &quot;pyramid.&quot; Thus, the name of the site is often translated as &quot;old mountain&quot; or &quot;old peak&quot;.

Although the original name given to the settlement by its builders is not definitively known, a 2021 study in &quot;Ñawpa Pacha: Journal of the Institute of Andean Studies&quot; suggests that the site was likely called &quot;Huayna Picchu,&quot; after the smaller peak nearby, or simply &quot;Picchu.&quot; According to the research, the association of the name Machu Picchu with the ruins likely began with American explorer Hiram Bingham&#x27;s 1911 publications, a conclusion supported by Bingham’s field notes, early maps, and historical documents.

==History==
Machu Picchu was previously believed (by Richard L. Burger, professor of anthropology at Yale University) to have been built in the 1450s. However, a 2021 study led by Burger used radiocarbon dating (specifically, AMS) to reveal that Machu Picchu may have been occupied from around 1420 to 1530 AD. Construction appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493).

A consensus among archaeologists is that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for his use as a retreat, most likely after a successful military campaign. Although Machu Picchu is considered to be a &quot;royal&quot; estate, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire. It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors even arrived in the area.

===Ancient life===
====Daily life in Machu Picchu====

During its use as an estate, it is estimated that about 750 people lived there, with most serving as support staff (&quot;yanaconas, yana)&quot; who lived there permanently. Though the estate belonged to Pachacutec, religious specialists and temporary specialized workers (&quot;mayocs&quot;) lived there as well, most likely for the ruler&#x27;s well-being and enjoyment. During the harsher season, staffing was reduced to a few hundred servants and a few religious specialists focused on maintenance alone.

Studies show that, according to their skeletal remains, most people who lived there were immigrants from diverse backgrounds. They lacked the chemical markers and osteological markers they would have if they had been living there their entire lives. Instead, research into skeletal remains has found bone damage from various species of water parasites indigenous to different areas of Peru. There were also varying osteological stressors and varying chemical densities suggesting varying long-term diets characteristic of specific regions that were spaced apart. These diets are composed of varying levels of maize, potatoes, grains, legumes, and fish, but the last-known short-term diet for these people was overall composed of less fish and more corn. This suggests that several of the immigrants were from more coastal areas and moved to Machu Picchu where corn was a larger portion of food intake. Most skeletal remains found at the site had lower levels of arthritis and bone fractures than those found in most sites of the Inca Empire. Incan individuals who had arthritis and bone fractures were typically those who performed heavy physical labor (such as the Mit&#x27;a) or served in the Inca military.

Animals are also suspected to have been brought to Machu Picchu, as there were several bones found that were not native to the area. Most animal bones found were from llamas and alpacas. These animals naturally live at altitudes of rather than the elevation of Machu Picchu. Most likely, these animals were brought in from the Puna region for meat consumption and for their pelts. Guinea pigs were also found at the site in special tomb caves, suggesting that they were at least used for funerary rituals, as it was common throughout the Inca Empire to use them for sacrifices and meat. Six dogs were also recovered from the site. Due to their placements among the human remains, it is believed that they served as companions of the dead.

====Agricultural activity====

Much of the farming done at Machu Picchu was done on its hundreds of (man-made terraces). These terraces were a work of considerable engineering, built to ensure good drainage and soil fertility while also protecting the mountain itself from erosion and landslides. However, the terraces were not perfect, as studies of the land show that there were landslides that happened during the construction of Machu Picchu. Still visible are places where the terraces were shifted by landslides and then stabilized by the Inca as they continued to build around the area. The terraces also enabled irrigation, increasing crop yields, with maize likely being the main crop due to its ceremonial importance, alongside possible cultivation of potatoes.

However, terrace farming area makes up only about of land, and a study of the soil around the terraces showed that what was grown there was mostly corn and potatoes, which was not enough to support the 750+ people living at Machu Picchu. This explains why studies done on the food that the Inca ate at Machu Picchu suggest it was imported from the surrounding valleys and farther afield.

It is estimated that the area around the site has received more than of rain per year since AD 1450, which was more than that needed to support crop growth. Because of the ample rainfall at Machu Picchu, it was found that irrigation was not usually needed for the terraces. The terraces received so much rain that they were built by Incan engineers specifically to allow for drainage of excess water. Excavation and soil analyses done by Kenneth Wright in the 1990s showed that the terraces were built in layers, with a bottom layer of larger stones covered by loose gravel. On top of the gravel was a layer of mixed sand and gravel packed together, with rich topsoil covering it. Research showed that the topsoil was probably moved from the valley floor to the terraces because it was much better than the soil higher up the mountain.

====Human sacrifice and mysticism====
Little information exists surrounding human sacrifices at Machu Picchu, though it is known that many sacrifices were never given a proper burial, and their skeletal remains succumbed to the elements. However, there is evidence that retainers were sacrificed to accompany a deceased noble in the afterlife. Animal, liquid and dirt sacrifices to the gods were more common and were made at the Altar of the Condor. The tradition is upheld by members of the New Age Andean religion.

===Encounters with Westerners===

====Spanish conquest====
In the late 16th century, Spaniards who had recently gained control of the area documented that indigenous individuals mentioned returning to &quot;Huayna Picchu&quot;, the name that is believed to be originally given to the site by locals. The Spanish conquistador Baltasar de Ocampo had notes of a visit during the end of the 16th century to a mountain fortress called &quot;Pitcos&quot; with sumptuous and majestic buildings, erected with great skill and art, all the lintels of the doors, as well the principal as the ordinary ones, being of marble and elaborately carved.

Over the centuries, the surrounding jungle overgrew the site, and few outside the immediate area knew of its existence. The site may have been re-discovered and plundered in 1867 by a German businessman, . Some evidence indicates that the German engineer J. M. von Hassel arrived earlier. Maps show references to Machu Picchu as early as 1874. A 1904 atlas designated the site as Huayna Picchu.

====Search for the Neo-Inca capital====
In 1911 American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham traveled the region looking for the lost capital of the Neo-Inca state (later established to be Vilcabamba), established by Manco Inca after the Spanish conquest, and was led to Machu Picchu by a villager, Melchor Arteaga. Bingham found the name of the Peruvian explorer Agustín Lizárraga and the date 1902 written in charcoal on one of the walls of the Temple of the Three Windows. Initially disappointed, he documented in his pocket field journal: &quot;Agustín Lizárraga is discoverer of Machu Picchu and lives at San Miguel Bridge just before passing.&quot; However, while Bingham initially acknowledged Lizárraga as the discoverer in his early writings and speeches, including &quot;Inca Land&quot; (1922), he gradually downplayed Lizárraga&#x27;s role until, in his final version of the story, &quot;Lost City of the Incas&quot; (1952), Bingham claimed to have found the site himself.

Though Bingham was not the first to visit the ruins, he was considered the scientific discoverer who brought Machu Picchu to international attention. Bingham organized another expedition in 1912 to undertake major clearing and excavation.

====First American expedition====

Bingham was a lecturer at Yale University, although not a trained archaeologist. In 1909, returning from the Pan-American Scientific Congress in Santiago, he travelled through Peru and was invited to explore the Inca ruins at Choqquequirau in the Apurímac Valley. He organized the 1911 Yale Peruvian Expedition in part to search for the Inca capital, which was thought to be the city of Vitcos, reportedly located near the town of Torontoy. He consulted Carlos Romero, one of the chief historians in Lima who showed him helpful references and Father Antonio de la Calancha&#x27;s Chronicle of the Augustinians. In particular, Ramos thought Vitcos was &quot;near a great white rock over a spring of fresh water.&quot; Back in Cusco again, Bingham asked planters about the places mentioned by Calancha, particularly along the Urubamba River. According to Bingham, &quot;one old prospector said there were interesting ruins at Machu Picchu,&quot; though his statements &quot;were given no importance by the leading citizens.&quot; Only later did Bingham learn that Charles Wiener had also heard of the ruins at Huayna Picchu and Machu Picchu, but was unable to reach them.

Armed with this information, Bingham&#x27;s expedition went down the Urubamba River. En route, Bingham asked local people to show them Inca ruins, especially any place described as having a white rock over a spring.

At Mandor Pampa, Bingham asked farmer and innkeeper Melchor Arteaga if he knew of any nearby ruins. Arteaga said he knew of excellent ruins on the top of Huayna Picchu. The next day, 24 July, Arteaga led Bingham and Sergeant Carrasco across the river on a log bridge and up the Machu Picchu site. At the top of the mountain, they came across a small hut occupied by a couple of Quechua people, Richard and Alvarez, who were farming some of the original Machu Picchu agricultural terraces that they had cleared four years earlier. Alvarez&#x27;s 11-year-old son, Pablito, led Bingham along the ridge to the main ruins.
The ruins were mostly covered with vegetation except for the cleared agricultural terraces and clearings used by the farmers as vegetable gardens. Because of the vegetation, Bingham was not able to observe the full extent of the site. He took preliminary notes, measurements, and photographs, noting the fine quality of Inca stonework of several principal buildings. Bingham was unsure about the original purpose of the ruins, but concluded there was no indication that it matched the description of Vitcos.

The expedition continued down the Urubamba and up the Vilcabamba Rivers examining all the ruins they could find. Guided by locals, Bingham rediscovered and correctly identified the site of the old Inca capital, Vitcos (then called Rosaspata), and the nearby temple of Chuquipalta. He then crossed a pass and into the Pampaconas Valley where he found more ruins heavily buried in the jungle undergrowth at Espíritu Pampa, which he named &quot;Trombone Pampa&quot;. As was the case with Machu Picchu, the site was so heavily overgrown that Bingham could only note a few of the buildings. In 1964, Gene Savoy further explored the ruins at Espiritu Pampa and revealed the full extent of the site, identifying it as Vilcabamba Viejo, where the Incas fled after the Spanish drove them from Vitcos.
Bingham returned to Machu Picchu in 1912 under the sponsorship of Yale University and National Geographic and with the full support of Peruvian President Augusto Leguia. The expedition undertook a four-month clearing of the site with local labor, which was expedited with the support of the Prefect of Cusco. Excavation started in 1912 with further excavation undertaken in 1914 and 1915. Bingham focused on Machu Picchu because of its fine Inca stonework and well-preserved nature, which had lain undisturbed since the site was abandoned. None of Bingham&#x27;s several hypotheses explaining the site have since held up. During his studies, he carried various artifacts back to Yale. One prominent artifact was a set of 15th-century, ceremonial Incan knives made from bismuth bronze; they are the earliest known artifact containing this alloy.

Although local institutions initially welcomed the exploration, they soon accused Bingham of legal and cultural malpractice. Rumors arose that the team was stealing artifacts and smuggling them out of Peru through Bolivia. In fact, Bingham removed many artifacts, but openly and legally; they were deposited in the Yale University Museum. Bingham was abiding by the 1852 Civil Code of Peru; the code stated that &quot;archaeological finds generally belonged to the discoverer, except when they had been discovered on private land&quot; (Batievsky 100). Local press perpetuated the accusations, claiming that the excavation harmed the site and deprived local archaeologists of knowledge about their own history. Landowners began to demand rent from the excavators. By the time Bingham and his team left Machu Picchu, locals had formed coalitions to defend their ownership of Machu Picchu and its cultural remains, while Bingham claimed the artifacts ought to be studied by experts in American institutions.

===Current state===
====Preservation====

In 1981, Peru declared an area of surrounding Machu Picchu a &quot;historic sanctuary&quot;. In addition to the ruins, the sanctuary includes a large portion of the adjoining region, rich with the flora and fauna of the Peruvian Yungas and Central Andean wet puna ecoregions.

Beyond its historical significance, Machu Picchu houses a diverse range of species. Among them are the Andean fox, puma, vizcacha, spectacled bear, and white-tailed deer. The sanctuary is also habitat for more than 420 bird species, notably the cock-of-the-rock and the Andean condor. The surrounding environment features a variety of tree species such as alder, white cedar, husk, and laurel.

In 1983, UNESCO designated Machu Picchu a World Heritage Site, describing it as &quot;a masterpiece of art, urbanism, architecture and engineering&quot; and &quot;a unique testimony&quot; of the Inca Civilization.

====The modern town of Machu Picchu====

Along the Urubamba river, below the ruins, surrounding the train line &quot;street&quot;, is the town of Machu Picchu, also known as Aguas Calientes (hot springs), with a post office, a train station, hotels, and other services for the many tourists. The station, called Puente Ruinas (the bridge to the ruins) is the end of the line for the &quot;tren de turismo&quot;, the tourist train, which arrives every morning from Cusco and returns every afternoon. There is also a luxury hotel on the mountain, near the ruins.

Machu Picchu is officially twinned with Haworth, West Yorkshire in the United Kingdom, as well as Fukushima and Ōtama, Japan, Petra, Jordan, Medley, United States, and Tinum, Mexico.

====Tourist activity====
Machu Picchu is both a cultural and natural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since Hiram Bingham&#x27;s expedition, growing numbers of tourists have visited the site each year, with numbers exceeding 1.5 million in 2019. As Peru&#x27;s most visited tourist attraction, and a major revenue generator, it is continually exposed to economic and commercial forces. In the late 1990s, the Peruvian government granted concessions to allow the construction of a cable car and a luxury hotel, including a tourist complex with boutiques and restaurants and a bridge to the site. These plans faced widespread protests, with critics arguing that the government had failed to conduct a proper environmental impact survey, as requested by the National Institute of Natural Resources, which warned of potential harm to the ecosystem. In 2018, plans were restarted to again construct a cable car to encourage Peruvians to visit Machu Picchu and boost domestic tourism. A no-fly zone exists above the area. UNESCO considered including Machu Picchu on its List of World Heritage in Danger in 2017, but ultimately decided against it.

Efforts to manage the impact of tourism have included various measures over the years. In the 1980s, a rock from Machu Picchu&#x27;s central plaza was moved to create a helicopter landing zone, a practice which was later stopped. In 2006, the company Helicusco sought approval for tourist flights over the site, but the license was soon rescinded. In January 2010, severe flooding caused by El Niño trapped over 4,000 people and disrupted access to Machu Picchu, leading to its temporary closure. The site reopened on April 1, 2010. To further address tourism&#x27;s impact, stricter entrance regulations were introduced in July 2011, limiting the number of daily visitors to 2,500 per day to the citadel and 400 to Huayna Picchu. In 2018, a third entrance phase was added to better manage tourism and reduce site degradation. In 2024, the daily visitor limit was officially increased to 4,500, with up to 5,600 permitted during peak season.

In May 2012, UNESCO urged additional protection measures for the site&#x27;s buffer zone, especially due to the rapid growth in the nearby town of Aguas Calientes. Tourist deaths at Machu Picchu from altitude sickness, floods, and accidents have led to criticism of UNESCO for allowing visits despite the site&#x27;s high safety risks. The trend of nude tourism in 2014 also led to increased surveillance by Peru&#x27;s Ministry of Culture to end the practice.

In recognition of efforts to manage and protect the site, Fernando Astete, who served as Chief of the National Archaeological Park of Machu Picchu from 1994 to 2019, was honored with the &quot;Personalidad Meritoria de la Cultura&quot; award by the Ministry of Culture of Peru in January 2020. This award acknowledged his extensive contributions to the preservation, management, and study of Machu Picchu.

During the 2022–2023 Peruvian protests, routes to Machu Picchu were blocked, trapping thousands of tourists and leading to a government airlift of the stranded visitors. Due to these disruptions, the Ministry of Culture closed the site indefinitely on January 22, 2023, and it was reopened on February 15, 2023.

==Geography==

Machu Picchu lies in the Southern Hemisphere, 13.111 degrees south of the equator. It is northwest of Cusco, on the crest of the mountain Machu Picchu, located about above mean sea level, over lower than Cusco, which has an elevation of . As such, it had a milder climate than the Inca capital. It is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Latin America and the most visited in Peru.

Machu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for to the river at their base. The area is subject to morning mists rising from the river. When inhabited by the Incas, the location of the city was a military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided natural defenses. The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge, across the Urubamba River in the Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for the Inca army. Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu, the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that measures .

The city sits in a saddle between the two mountains Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu, with a view down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back. The agricultural terraces, covering about , complemented the site&#x27;s architecture and protected against runoff and erosion. Constructed with stone retaining walls and well-drained topsoil, the terraces were built using deeper strata and stone chips to enhance drainage and ensure stability. Two high-altitude routes from Machu Picchu cross the mountains back to Cusco, one through the Sun Gate, and the other across the Inca bridge. Both could have been blocked easily, should invaders have approached along them.

Machu Picchu and other sites in the area are built over earthquake faults. According to research conducted in 2019, this may not be a coincidence: &quot;[o]ne simple answer, researchers now suggest, is that that&#x27;s [earthquake faults] where building materials for the site—large amounts of already fractured rock—were readily available.&quot;

===Climate===
Between the valley floor and the altitudinal zone of the Inca citadel, ranging from to meters above sea level, the climate is warm and humid, with an average annual precipitation of and an annual mean temperature of approximately . The site is characterized by steep slopes, dense vegetation, and significant rainfall, contributing to high humidity levels of 80–90%. The area is also frequently enveloped in cloud cover, typical of a cloud forest environment.

==Site==
===Layout===

The site is roughly divided into an urban sector and an agricultural sector, with the former divided between an upper town and a lower town. The temples are in the upper town, the warehouses in the lower.

The architecture is adapted to the mountains. Approximately 200 buildings are arranged on wide parallel terraces around an east–west central square. The various compounds, called &quot;kanchas&quot;, are long and narrow in order to exploit the terrain. Sophisticated channeling systems provided irrigation for the fields. Stone stairways set in the walls allowed access to the different levels across the site. The eastern section of the city was probably residential. The western, separated by the square, was for religious and ceremonial purposes. This section contains the &quot;Torreón&quot;, the massive tower which may have been used as an observatory.

Located in the urban sector are the primary archaeological treasures and tourist attractions: the &quot;Intihuatana&quot;, the &quot;Temple of the Sun&quot; and the &quot;Temple of the Three Windows&quot;.

The Popular District, or Residential District, is the place where the lower-class people lived. It includes storage buildings and simple houses.

The royalty area, a sector for the nobility, is a group of houses located in rows over a slope; the residence of the &quot;amautas&quot; (wise people) was characterized by its reddish walls, and the zone of the &quot;ñustas&quot; (princesses) had trapezoid-shaped rooms. The Monumental Mausoleum is a carved statue with a vaulted interior and carved drawings. It was used for rites or sacrifices.

The Guardhouse is a three-sided building, with one of its long sides opening onto the Terrace of the Ceremonial Rock. The three-sided style of Inca architecture is known as the &quot;wayrona&quot; style.

In 2005 and 2009, the University of Arkansas made detailed laser scans of the entire site and of the ruins at the top of the adjacent Huayna Picchu mountain. The scan data is available online for research purposes.

===Sites of interest===
====Temple of the Sun or Torreón====
This semicircular temple is built on the same rock overlying Bingham&#x27;s &quot;Royal Mausoleum&quot;, and is similar to the Temple of the Sun found in Cusco and the one found in Pisac, in having what Bingham described as a &quot;parabolic enclosure wall&quot;. The stonework is of ashlar quality. Within the temple is a 1.2 m by 2.7 m rock platform, smooth on top except for a small platform on its southwest quadrant. A &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Door&quot; faces 340°, or just west of north, opening onto a series of 16 pools, and affording a view of Huayna Picchu. The temple also has two trapezoidal windows, one facing 65°, called the &quot;Solstice Window&quot;, and the other facing 132°, called the &quot;Qullqa Window&quot;. The northwest edge of the rock platform points out the Solstice Window to within 2&#x27; of the 15th century June solstice rising Sun. For comparison, the angular diameter of the Sun is 32&#x27;. The Inca constellation Qullca, storehouse, can be viewed out the Qullqa Window at sunset during the 15th-century June Solstice, hence the window&#x27;s name. At the same time, the Pleaides are at the opposite end of the sky. Also seen through this window on this night are the constellations Llamacnawin, Llama, Unallamacha, Machacuay, and the star Pachapacariq Chaska (Canopus).

====Intihuatana stone====

The &quot;Intihuatana&quot; stone is a ritual stone which was used by the Incas. The stone is designed to point directly at the Sun during the winter solstice. The name of the stone (perhaps coined by Bingham) derives from Quechua language: &quot;inti&quot; means &quot;sun&quot;, and &quot;wata-&quot;, &quot;to tie, hitch (up)&quot;. The suffix &quot;-na&quot; derives nouns for tools or places. Hence &quot;Intihuatana&quot; is literally an instrument or place to &quot;tie up the sun&quot;, often expressed in English as &quot;The Hitching Post of the Sun&quot;. The Inca believed the stone held the Sun in its place along its annual path in the sky. The stone is situated at 13°9&#x27;48&quot; S. At midday on 11 November and 30 January, the Sun is situated almost exactly above the pillar, casting no shadow. On 21 June, the stone casts the longest shadow on its southern side, and on 21 December a much shorter shadow on its northern side.

====Inti Mach&#x27;ay and the Royal Feast of the Sun====
Inti Mach&#x27;ay is a special cave used to observe the Royal Feast of the Sun. This festival was celebrated during the Incan month of &quot;Qhapaq Raymi&quot;. It began earlier in the month and concluded on the December solstice. On this day, noble boys were initiated into manhood by an ear-piercing ritual as they stood inside the cave and watched the sunrise.

Architecturally, Inti Mach&#x27;ay is often considered to be the most significant structure at Machu Picchu. Its entrances, walls, steps, and windows are some of the finest masonry in the Incan Empire. The cave also includes a tunnel-like window unique among Incan structures, which was constructed to allow sunlight into the cave only during several days around the December solstice. For this reason, the cave was inaccessible for much of the year. Inti Mach&#x27;ay is located on the eastern side of Machu Picchu, just north of the &quot;Condor Stone.&quot; Many of the caves surrounding this area were prehistorically used as tombs, yet there is no evidence that Mach&#x27;ay was a burial ground.

====Dispute over cultural artifacts====
In 1912, 1914 and 1915, Bingham removed thousands of artifacts from Machu Picchu—ceramic vessels, silver statues, jewelry, and human bones—and took them to Yale University for further study, supposedly for 18 months. Yale instead kept the artifacts until 2012, arguing that Peru lacked the infrastructure and systems to care for them. Eliane Karp, an anthropologist and wife of former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo, accused Yale of profiting from Peru&#x27;s cultural heritage. Many of the articles were exhibited at Yale&#x27;s Peabody Museum.

In 2006, Yale returned some pieces but retained more than 250 &quot;museum-quality&quot; pieces, claiming this was supported by federal case law of Peruvian antiquities. In 2007, the Peruvian government and Yale had agreed on a joint traveling exhibition and construction of a new museum and research center in Cusco advised by Yale. Yale acknowledged Peru&#x27;s title to all the objects, but would share rights with Peru in the research collection, part of which would remain at Yale for continuing study. In November 2010, Yale agreed to return the disputed artifacts. The third and final batch of artifacts was delivered in November 2012. The artifacts are permanently exhibited at the Museo Machu Picchu, La Casa Concha (&quot;The Shell House&quot;), close to Cusco&#x27;s colonial center. Owned by the National University of San Antonio Abad del Cusco, La Casa Concha also features a study area for local and foreign students.

===Construction===


The central buildings in the Machu Picchu citadel use the classical Inca architectural style of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, called ashlar, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar.

The site may have been intentionally built on fault lines to provide natural drainage and a source of fractured stone for construction. According to geologist Rualdo Menegat, Machu Picchu &quot;shows us that the Incan civilization was an empire of fractured rocks.&quot;

The section of the mountain where Machu Picchu was built provided various challenges that the Incas solved with local materials. One issue was the seismic activity due to two fault lines which made mortar and similar building methods nearly useless. Instead, the Inca mined stones from some quarries at the site, including one recently discovered using remote sensing techniques, which was probably located in the catchment area between the Hurin and Hanan before it was covered over to create the current Plaza Principal. Once mined, the Inca lined the granite stones up and shaped them to fit together perfectly, stabilizing the structures. Inca walls have many stabilizing features: doors and windows are trapezoidal, narrowing from bottom to top; corners usually are rounded; inside corners often incline slightly into the rooms, and outside corners were often tied together by L-shaped blocks; walls are offset slightly from row to row rather than rising straight from bottom to top.

Heavy rainfall required terraces to drain rain water and prevent mudslides, landslides, erosion, and flooding. Terraces were layered with stone chips, sand, dirt, and topsoil, to absorb water and prevent it from running down the mountain. Similar layering protected the large city center from flooding. Multiple canals and reserves throughout the city provided water that could be supplied to the terraces for irrigation and to prevent erosion and flooding.

The approach to moving and placing the enormous stones remains uncertain, probably involving hundreds of men to push the stones up inclines. A few stones have knobs that could have been used to lever them into position; the knobs were generally sanded away, with a few overlooked. For larger stones, the Incas likely employed ramps with gentle inclines, along with wooden rollers, levers, and ropes made from maguey fibers. Most stones were moved from higher to lower elevations, but some, like those at Ollantaytambo, were transported over long distances.

===Transportation===
The Inca road system included a route to the Machu Picchu region. The people of Machu Picchu were connected to long-distance trade, as shown by non-local artifacts found at the site. For example, Bingham found unmodified obsidian nodules at the entrance gateway. In the 1970s, Burger and Asaro determined that these obsidian samples were from the &quot;Titicaca&quot; or Chivay obsidian source, and that the samples from Machu Picchu showed long-distance transport of this obsidian type in pre-Hispanic Peru.

Today, visitors can reach Machu Picchu via three main routes. The most popular option is the train journey from Cusco or Ollantaytambo. Operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail, this scenic route takes visitors to the town of Aguas Calientes, from where they can take a bus ride of or walk to the Machu Picchu entrance.

Another widely chosen route is the Inca Trail, a historic path built by the Incas considered &quot;the most famous hike in South America&quot; by Lonely Planet, attracting thousands of tourists each year.
The trail, which starts at Piscacucho (also known as Km 82 on the railway to Aguas Calientes) or Km 104, depending on the length of the trek, spans approximately and reaches an altitude of . It passes through the Andes and various archaeological sites before reaching the Sun Gate (Intipunku) at Machu Picchu. Due to limited permits, advance booking through a tourism agency is required.

Alternatively, travelers can take a less conventional route that involves traveling by road to a point near the Hydroelectric station. From there, they can either walk or take a short train ride to Aguas Calientes. This option is generally more affordable and does not require advance booking, but it is less recommended during the rainy season due to potential landslide risks.

As of November 2024, the construction of a new paved roadway right to the doorstep of the historic site is in progress and due for completion in 2025. The path, otherwise known as Santa María-Santa Teresa-Machu Picchu Hydroelectric Bridge highway, involves 28.41 kilometers (22 miles) of asphalt-paved roads that would generally reduce access time to the heritage site from 4 or 5 hours, to 2 hours.

==In media==
===Motion pictures===
The Paramount Pictures film &quot;Secret of the Incas&quot; (1954), with Charlton Heston and Yma Sumac, was filmed on location at Cusco and Machu Picchu, the first time that a major Hollywood studio filmed on site. Five hundred indigenous people were hired as extras in the film.

The opening sequence of the film &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; (1972) was shot in the Machu Picchu area and on the stone stairway of Huayna Picchu.

Machu Picchu was featured prominently in the film &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; (2004), a biopic based on the 1952 youthful travel memoir of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara.

The &quot;NOVA&quot; television documentary &quot;Ghosts of Machu Picchu&quot; presents an elaborate documentary on the mysteries of Machu Picchu.

Multimedia artist Kimsooja used footage shot near Machu Picchu in the first episode of her film series &quot;Thread Routes&quot;, shot in 2010.

On their 7th release, &quot;&quot; (2023) brought the Autobots to Machu Picchu and more of Cusco&#x27;s famous sites.

===Music===
The song &quot;Kilimanjaro&quot;, from the Indian Tamil-language film &quot;Enthiran&quot; (2010), was filmed in Machu Picchu with some 100 Brazilian extras. The shoot was choreographed by Raju Sundaram and supervised by Fernando Astete, chief of the National Archaeological Park of Machu Picchu.

<doc id="80020" wikidata="Q207898" url="?curid=80020" title="Manu Chao">
<text>Manu Chao (; born José Manuel Tomás Arturo Chao Ortega on 21 June 1961) is a French-born Spanish musician. He sings in French, Spanish, English, Italian, Arabic, Catalan, Galician, Portuguese, Greek, and occasionally in other languages. Chao began his musical career in Paris, busking and playing with groups such as Hot Pants and Los Carayos, which combined a variety of languages and musical styles. With friends and his brother Antoine Chao, he founded the band Mano Negra in 1987, achieving considerable success, particularly in Europe. He became a solo artist after its breakup in 1995 and since then has toured regularly with his live band, Radio Bemba Sound System.

==Early life==
Chao&#x27;s mother, Felisa Ortega, is from Bilbao, Basque Country, and his father, writer and journalist Ramón Chao, is from Vilalba, Galicia. They emigrated to Paris to avoid Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship—Manu&#x27;s grandfather had been sentenced to death. Shortly after Manu&#x27;s birth, the Chao family moved to the outskirts of Paris, and Manu spent most of his childhood in Boulogne-Billancourt and Sèvres. As he grew up he was surrounded by many artists and intellectuals, most of whom were acquaintances of his father. Chao cites much of his childhood experience as inspiration for some songs. As a child, he was a big fan of Cuban singer-pianist Bola de Nieve.

==Career==
===Early years and Mano Negra (1984–1995)===
Heavily influenced by the UK rock scene, particularly The Clash and The Jam, and Dr. Feelgood, Chao and other musicians formed the Spanish/English rockabilly group Hot Pants in the mid-1980s. The group released a demo entitled &quot;Mala Vida&quot; in 1984, which received plenty of local critical praise but otherwise gained them little attention. By the time the group released their first album in 1986 the Parisian alternative music scene had taken flight, and Manu, his brother Antoine Chao, and friends such as Alain from Les Wampas formed Los Carayos to incorporate this sound with the rockabilly and punk styles of Hot Pants. Los Carayos remained a side project of the artists for eight years, releasing three albums in the first two years followed by a final album in 1994.

In 1987, the Chao brothers and their cousin Santiago Casariego founded the band Mano Negra. Manu Chao said in Alt.Latino in 2011, &quot;Mano Negra started playing in a subway in Paris before the band started to be known and selling records. We started in a subway for a living. This is what made the musicians of Mano Negra. And so the people using the subway in Paris was very eclectic. There were people from a lot of different countries, different cultures. So we have to be able to play all kinds of music to please all the people in a subway. So that was a perfect school to learn a lot of different styles of music.&quot; Starting on a smaller label, the group released a reworked version of the Hot Pants single &quot;Mala Vida&quot; in 1988, which quickly became a hit in France. The group soon moved to Virgin Records, and their first album &quot;Patchanka&quot; was released the following year. Though the group never gained much fame in the English-speaking market, popularity throughout the rest of the world soon followed, reaching the Top 5 in the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. The band achieved some fame in South America with 1992&#x27;s Cargo Tour, where it played a series of shows in port cities, performing from a stage built into their tour ship&#x27;s hold. Mano Negra also performed a tour through much of Colombia in a retired train, the &quot;Ice Express&quot;. Still, rifts began to grow among band members during the port tour and the following year&#x27;s train tour; many band members, including Manu&#x27;s brother Antoine, had left the group by the end of 1994. Following that year&#x27;s release of their final album, &quot;Casa Babylon,&quot; Manu Chao moved the band to Madrid, but legal problems with former bandmates led Chao to disband the group in 1995.

Mano Negra&#x27;s sound is mostly characterized by energetic, lively rhythms, symbolized by the title of their first album, &quot;Patchanka&quot;, derived from the word &quot;pachanga&quot; (which is a colloquial term for &quot;party&quot;), and a distinct informality which allows the audience to get involved and feel close to their sound. Mixed music genres are present throughout their albums. Manu Chao is friends with Gogol Bordello and that group has covered Mano Negra&#x27;s song &quot;Mala Vida&quot; on their own and with Chao beginning in 2006.

===Solo years with Radio Bemba (1995–present)===

After arriving in Madrid, Chao and other bandmates from Mano Negra formed a new group, Radio Bemba Sound System (named for the communication system used in the Sierra Maestra by the Castro-and-Guevara-led rebels in the Cuban Revolution), featuring groups from diverse backgrounds, such as Mexican Tijuana No!, Brazilian Skank, and Argentinian Todos Tus Muertos. The goal was to replicate the sound of street music and bar scenes from a variety of cultures; to that end, Chao and the group spent several years travelling throughout South and Central America, recording new music as they went. The resulting music differed drastically from Mano Negra; the songs were primarily sung in Spanish with far fewer French tracks and the musical style had shifted from punk and alternative styles to the street vibe Chao was aiming for. The songs were collectively released as &quot;Clandestino&quot; in 1998, under Manu Chao&#x27;s own name. Though not an instant success, the album gained a steady following in France with hits such as &quot;Bongo Bong&quot; and &quot;Clandestino&quot;, and the album eventually earned the Best World Music Album award in 1999&#x27;s Victoires de la Musique awards. It sold in excess of 5 million copies.

Chao&#x27;s second album with Radio Bemba Sound System, &quot;Próxima Estación: Esperanza,&quot; was released in 2001. This album, named after one of the Madrid metro station stops (the title translates to &quot;Next Station: Hope&quot;), features similar sounds to &quot;Clandestino&quot; but with heavier Caribbean influences than the previous album. The album was an instant hit, leading to a successful tour that resulted in the 2002 live album &quot;Radio Bemba Sound System.&quot; Two years later, Chao returned to his French roots with the French-only album &quot;Sibérie m&#x27;était contéee,&quot; which included a large book featuring lyrics to the album and illustrations by Jacek Woźniak.

Chao&#x27;s next album &quot;La Radiolina&quot; (literally &quot;little radio&quot; in Italian, but also &quot;pocket radio&quot;) was released on 17 September 2007. This was the first international release since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Próxima Estación: Esperanza&quot;. &quot;Rainin in Paradize&quot; was the first single from the album, available for download on his website before the release of the album. Concert reviews indicate that music from &quot;La Radiolina&quot; was already being performed live as early as April 2007&#x27;s Coachella show.

Chao&#x27;s most recent album, &quot;Viva Tu&quot;, was released on September 20, 2024. It was preceded by videos for two songs, &quot;Viva Tu&quot; and &quot;Sao Paulo Motoboy&quot;, released May 29, 2024 and June 26, 2024, respectively.

===Other works===
In 2003 he approached Amadou &amp; Mariam and later produced their 2004 album &quot;Dimanche à Bamako&quot; (&quot;Sunday in Bamako&quot;). His song &quot;Me llaman Calle&quot;, written for the 2005 Spanish film &quot;Princesas&quot;, won a Goya Award for Best Original Song. The song was later included on 2007&#x27;s &quot;La Radiolina&quot;. Vocals from the song are included in the Go Lem System song &quot;Calle Go Lem&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;Me Llaman Calle&quot; one of The 10 Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at No. 8. Writer Josh Tyrangiel observed: Chao&#x27;s warm singing over José Manuel Gamboa and Carlos Herrero&#x27;s leaping Flamenco counter melody creates a direct emotional line to the core of this mid-tempo ballad. With its easy melody and universal rhythm Me Llaman Calle walks proudly in the shadow of Bob Marley, the last guy who made world music this disarmingly simple.Manu Chao was featured on the album &quot;True Love&quot; by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Gwen Stefani / No Doubt, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, The Roots, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites.

His song &quot;La Vida Tómbola&quot; was featured in the documentary film &quot;Maradona&quot; by Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica. The song &quot;La Trampa&quot;, recorded with Tonino Carotone for the compilation album &quot;Fuerza!&quot; was used as the theme song for the short-lived improvisational comedy &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Green Screen Show&quot;.

The songs &quot;Bongo Bong&quot; and &quot;Je ne t&#x27;aime plus&quot;, which appear back-to-back on &quot;Clandestino&quot;, were covered by British singers Robbie Williams and Lily Allen, who recorded them as a single track, &quot;Bongo Bong and Je Ne T&#x27;aime Plus&quot; and released it as a single from the album &quot;Rudebox&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
Manu Chao sings in Spanish, French, English, Portuguese, Galician, Arabic and Wolof, often mixing several languages in the same song. His music has many influences, such as punk, rock, French &quot;chanson&quot;, Iberoamerican salsa, reggae, ska, and Algerian raï. These influences were obtained from immigrants in France, his Iberian connections, and foremost his travels in Mesoamerica as a nomad following the disbanding of Mano Negra. While Mano Negra called their style &quot;patchanka&quot; (literally &quot;patchwork&quot;), Manu Chao speaks of &quot;música mestiza&quot; (:de:Mestizo-Musik), a musical style which may also incorporate elements of rap, flamenco, Afro-Cuban music, samba and cumbia.

In many of his pieces he layers lyrics, music, and sound recordings over each other. In the short documentary film &quot;Infinita tristeza&quot; (essentially a video travelogue of Chao&#x27;s 2001 tour of South America), included within the bonus section of his 2002 live DVD release &quot;Babylonia en Guagua&quot;, Chao explained that his only recording tool is a small IBM ThinkPad laptop computer, which he carries with him wherever he goes; he has occasionally used conventional recording studios, such as Europa Sonor in Paris, to overdub instruments such as drums, electric guitars and brass, but the vast majority of his material (including all sorts of spoken-word samples from radio stations, TV, films, old vinyl records and, on &quot;Próxima Estación: Esperanza&quot;, announcements from the Madrid Metro) has been recorded by Chao himself exclusively on his laptop. The Spanish credit &quot;Grabado en el Estudio Clandestino&quot; (&quot;Recorded in Studio Clandestino/Clandestine Studio&quot;), which appears on all of his solo album starting from 1998&#x27;s &quot;Clandestino&quot;, actually refers to the laptop.
Chao also has a tendency to reuse music or lyrics from previous songs to form new songs. The contemporary hit single in France &quot;Bongo Bong&quot;, takes its lyrics from the earlier Mano Negra hit &quot;King of Bongo&quot;, which bears a similar style to that of The Clash. The musical backdrop for &quot;Bongo Bong&quot;, in turn, was used in several other Chao songs, including &quot;Je Ne T&#x27;Aime Plus&quot; from the same album and &quot;Mr. Bobby&quot; and &quot;Homens&quot; from &quot;Próxima Estación: Esperanza&quot;. (According to a statement by Chao himself in the &quot;Próxima Estación&quot; CD booklet, &quot;Homens&quot; is the song which the backdrop was originally written and recorded for, and all the others came later.) Also, the tune of &quot;La Primavera&quot;, a track from that same album, is used in several other songs featured on the LP, while lyrics for a few songs on &quot;Sibérie m&#x27;était contéee&quot; are repeated several times with different music, leading the lyrics to be interpreted in various ways depending on the mood of the track. Several musical themes and clips from that album also appear on Amadou &amp; Mariam&#x27;s Chao-produced &quot;Dimanche à Bamako&quot;, which were being produced at approximately the same time.

Though Chao is well known in Europe and Latin America, he has not had the same success in the United States and Australia. Tours in the United States with Mano Negra were not as successful as elsewhere. Though his live performances in the U.S. are infrequent, Chao played a handful of dates there in 2006, including a headlining show at Lollapalooza 2006 in Chicago. He was one of the headlining acts at the 2008 Austin City Limits Music Festival and the Outside Lands Music Festival in Golden Gate Park. In January 2012 he was the headline act at the opening night of Sydney Festival, marking his first concert in Australia.

== Political views and activism ==
Chao believes that our world lacks spaces for &quot;collective therapy&quot; and describes his concerts as small temporary spaces where people of different backgrounds can come together.

Chao&#x27;s lyrics provoke his audience to think about immigration, love, living in ghettos, drugs, and often carry a left-wing message. This reflects Chao&#x27;s own political leanings—he is very close to the Zapatistas and their public spokesman, Subcomandante Marcos. He has many followers among the European left, the Latin American left and the anti-globalisation and anti-capitalist movements. Chao is a founding member of ATTAC. Punk and reggae historian Vivien Goldman commented of his work, &quot;I was writing about Good Charlotte and The Police. They adopted the trappings of punk. They aren&#x27;t bad groups, but the punk aspect is more manifested by somebody like Manu Chao. He&#x27;s one of the punkiest artists out there I can think of. It&#x27;s an inclusionary spirit that is punk.&quot;

Since 1991, Chao has been working with La Colifata, which is an NGO made up of a group of patients and ex patients of Hospital Borda, a psychiatric hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Chao uses both a website and a Facebook account to show the work he does with these patients and ex patients. On their Facebook page he explains that the mission of this group is to diminish the stigma that people place on mental illness and to promote the use of services that are meant to help those with mental illnesses.

=== Interview with the University of Southern California (2010) ===
In an interview with the School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California in 2010, Chao expressed his opinions about topics such as the effects of economic globalization on social inequality. He explained how he believes that the global market is causing social inequality, and how issues in education and immigration are connected to this. In this interview he expressed a worry that mafias are the greatest threat to democracy and that this is already evident in certain places, like Russia and Mexico. He stated that this is one reason that he is for the legalization of drugs such as marijuana - he explained that mafias are making capital off of the distribution of illegal drugs which gives them more economic power, thus making it easier for them to potentially overthrow governments.

In this interview he also expressed his belief that currently, the global market is the largest force shaping the lives of people throughout the world. For this reason, he believes that the most effective way to solve social problems in individual countries is to address them at a global level by changing the policies dictating the global market. He explained that since most people are not given the power to directly change these policies, the most effective way to bring about change would be to make a statement to those running the economy by becoming self-sufficient through boycotting corporations, growing one&#x27;s own vegetables, and making one&#x27;s own clothes.

He then added that he does not own a car or cell phone because he does not need either of these. He also talked about having weak leaders as a threat to democracy and explained that there are small movements in Spain that are fighting for blank votes to be recorded as legitimate votes. He explained this could be a solution because blank votes currently make up a majority of the votes in elections, which means that election results are inaccurate.

Another topic he discussed during this interview was education. He expressed his belief that education is important and should be free for everyone. He mentioned that Cuba is able to provide free education for all those living in Cuba despite being a small country and that he does not understand how the United States being such a powerful nation was not able to do the same. He then expressed frustration at the fact that one can enroll in the armed forces in the United States and &quot;learn to kill&quot; for free, but had to pay to learn to do anything else. He suggested that this is a sign that the United States is afraid of its future.

When asked about immigration during this interview, Chao mentioned that the West, particularly the United States, has a population with a lot of elderly people and that in order to excel in the future, the West needs the youth from &quot;Third World&quot; countries. He explains that providing legal status to immigrant young people would require the United States to honor the rights of these immigrants, and therefore it is cheaper and easier for the United States to deny so many young immigrants a legal status. He then said that the &quot;Occident...needs to open the borders.&quot;

In an article published in 2010, Cornelia Gräbner mentioned Chao&#x27;s lyrics in a discussion about how the work of four different authors who contribute to the alter-globalization movement. Gräbner discusses how Manu Chao, Eduardo Galeano, Subcomandante Marcos, and José Saramago present alternative practice of politics from different perspectives. Gräbner states that Chao&#x27;s work emphasizes the connection of contemporary &#x27;contentious Europe&#x27; with past struggles, particularly through his lyrics and combinations of musical styles. Gräbner believes that Chao&#x27;s family history plays a crucial role in his political views and how that has shaped the way he creates his music. She explains that &quot;Chao translates his family&#x27;s anti-fascist political tradition into a politicized embrace of cultural difference and into a clear anti-racist and anticapitalist stance.&quot; She also states that Chao continues to use these messages in his music even after the dissolution of Mano Negra.

<text>Michael Paul Marshall Smith (born 3 May 1965) is an English novelist, screenwriter and short story writer who also writes as Michael Marshall, M. M. Smith and Michael Rutger.

==Biography==
Born in Knutsford, Cheshire, Smith moved with his family at an early age to first Illinois and then Florida. When he was seven, the family moved again, this time to South Africa, and then to Australia before eventually returning home to England in 1973.

He was educated at Chigwell School, where he was in Swallows House and dated fellow pupil and future senior Sky News editor Sally Arthy, and at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he studied Philosophy, Social and Political Science, and became involved with the Cambridge Footlights. Under the pseudonym of Michael Rutger, he moved on to become a comedy writer and performer on the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;And Now in Colour&quot;, which has been described as a &#x27;cult hit&#x27; and ran for two series. Between 2002 and 2004, he also co-wrote material for two series of surreal comedy &quot;Dare to Believe&quot;.

==Writing career==
Smith&#x27;s first published story was &quot;The Man Who Drew Cats&quot;, which won the British Fantasy Award in 1991 for &quot;Best Short Story&quot;. He has been published in &quot;Postscripts&quot;. His first novel, &quot;Only Forward&quot;, was published in 1994 and won the August Derleth Award for Best Novel in 1995, and then the Philip K. Dick Award in 2000. The plot involves the lead character, Stark, having to find a missing man he believes to have been kidnapped, and travel through the strange zones of his city. In 1996 his second novel, &quot;Spares&quot;, was released, a novel in which the lead character, Jack, goes on the run with clones who are used for spare body parts for rich people, when he realises they are people with feelings. Steven Spielberg&#x27;s DreamWorks purchased the film rights for Spares, but a film was never made. When the rights lapsed, DreamWorks did produce &quot;The Island&quot;, whose plot had strong similarities to &quot;Spares&quot;, though Smith did not consider it worthwhile to pursue legal action over the similarities. He now considers it unlikely a &quot;Spares&quot; film will ever be made.

The novel &quot;The Straw Men&quot; was the first to be written under the shortened name &quot;Michael Marshall&quot;. This change of name was originally due to the publishing of another book of the same name in 2001 by Martin J. Smith. However, Marshall Smith then decided to use the split to offer the possibility of publishing different genres of books under the two names – &quot;modern day&quot; novels as Michael Marshall, and horror/science fiction as Michael Marshall Smith.

On 1 September 2006, it was announced on his official website that the horror short story &quot;Hell Hath Enlarged Herself&quot; was in development as a feature film by Cuba Productions and Lightworks Films, financed by the UK Film Council. Smith will be a producer and co-screenwriter on the film.

In 2012 he launched Ememess Press, a virtual small press specialising in producing electronic versions of the short fiction written under the name Michael Marshall Smith.

&quot;Intruders&quot;, a television series on BBC America, is based on Smith&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;The Intruders&quot;.

<doc id="80027" wikidata="Q72092" url="?curid=80027" title="Rage Against the Machine">
<text>Rage Against the Machine (often abbreviated as RATM or shortened to Rage) was an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1991. It consisted of vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello, and drummer Brad Wilk. They melded heavy metal and rap music, punk rock and funk with anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist, and revolutionary lyrics. As of 2010, they had sold over 16 million records worldwide. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.

Rage Against the Machine released their self-titled debut album in 1992 to acclaim; in 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 368 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. They achieved commercial success following their performances at the 1993 Lollapalooza festival. Their next albums, &quot;Evil Empire&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot; (1999), topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Rage Against the Machine became a popular and influential band, and influenced the nu metal genre which came to prominence during the late 1990s and early 2000s. They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.

In 2000, Rage Against the Machine released the cover album &quot;Renegades&quot; and disbanded after growing creative differences. After pursuing other projects for several years, they reunited to perform at Coachella in 2007. Over the next four years, the band played live venues and festivals around the world before going on hiatus in 2011. In 2019, Rage Against the Machine announced a world tour that was delayed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was ultimately cut short after de la Rocha suffered a leg injury. Wilk confirmed in 2024 that the band had disbanded for the third time.

== History ==
=== 1991–1992: Early years ===

In 1991, following the break-up of guitarist Tom Morello&#x27;s former band Lock Up, former Lock Up drummer Jon Knox encouraged Tim Commerford and Zack de la Rocha to jam with Morello as he was looking to start a new group. Morello soon contacted Brad Wilk, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for both Lock Up and the band that would later become Pearl Jam. This lineup named themselves Rage Against the Machine, after a song De la Rocha had written for his former underground hardcore punk band Inside Out (also to be the title of the unrecorded &quot;Inside Out&quot; full-length album). Record label owner and zine publisher Kent McClard, with whom Inside Out was associated, coined the phrase &quot;rage against the machine&quot; in a 1989 article in his zine &quot;No Answers&quot;.

The blueprint for the group&#x27;s major-label debut album and demo tape &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; was laid on a twelve-song self-released cassette, the cover image of which featured newspaper clippings of the stock market section with a single match taped to the inlay card. Not all 12 songs made it onto the final album—two were eventually included as B-sides, while three others never saw an official release. Several record labels expressed interest, and the band eventually signed with Epic Records. Morello said, &quot;Epic agreed to everything we asked—and they&#x27;ve followed through ... We never saw a[n] [ideological] conflict as long as we maintained creative control.&quot;

=== 1992–1994: &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; ===

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot;, was released in November 1992. The cover featured Malcolm Browne&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of Thích Quảng Đức, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, burning himself to death in Saigon in 1963 in protest of the murder of Buddhists by the regime of the U.S.-backed prime minister Ngô Đình Diệm&#x27;s. The album was produced by Canadian record producer and music engineer Garth Richardson.

While sales were initially slow, the album became a critical and commercial success, driven by heavy radio airplay of the song &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;, a heavy, driving track featuring only eight lines of lyrics. The &quot;Fuck You&quot; version, which contains 17 instances of the word &quot;fuck&quot;, was once accidentally played on the BBC Radio 1 Top 40 singles show on February 21, 1993. The band&#x27;s profile soared following a performance at the Lollapalooza festival in mid-1993 tour; sales of &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; in the United States increased from 75,000 before Lollapalooza, to 400,000 by the end of the year. The band also toured with Suicidal Tendencies in Europe, and House of Pain. By April 1996, the album had sold over 1 million copies in the United States and 3 million copies worldwide. It was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in May 2000.

Rage Against the Machine appeared on the soundtrack for the 1995 film &quot;Higher Learning&quot; with the song &quot;Year of tha Boomerang&quot;. An early version of &quot;Tire Me&quot; also appeared in the movie. Subsequently, they re-recorded the song &quot;Darkness&quot; from their original demo for the soundtrack of &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994), while &quot;No Shelter&quot; appeared on the &quot;&quot; soundtrack in 1998.

=== 1995–2000: Mainstream success ===
In late 1994, Rage Against the Machine took a hiatus from touring, sparking rumors that they had broken up. According to an anonymous source reporting to &quot;MTV News&quot;, Rage Against the Machine had recorded 23 tracks with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien in Atlanta starting in November 1994, and briefly broke up due to violent infighting in the band, before regrouping for the KROQ Weenie Roast in June 1995. Morello later said there had been conflict over their musical direction, which were reconciled.

The band eventually recorded their long-awaited follow-up album, &quot;Evil Empire&quot;, with O&#x27;Brien in November and December 1995. Morello said that, as a result of the band&#x27;s musical tensions, the album incorporated greater hip hop influences, describing its sound as a &quot;middle ground between Public Enemy and the Clash&quot;.

&quot;Evil Empire&quot; was released on April 16, 1996, and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number one, selling 249,000 copies in its first week. It later rose to triple platinum status. Rage Against the Machine performed &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in April 1996. Their planned two-song performance was cut to one song when the band attempted to hang inverted American flags from their amplifiers (&quot;a sign of distress or great danger&quot;), in protest of the program&#x27;s guest host, Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes.

In 1997, the band opened for U2 on the PopMart Tour. Their profits went to organizations such as the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, Women Alive and the Zapatista Front for National Liberation. Rage began an abortive headlining U.S. tour with Wu-Tang Clan. Police in several jurisdictions unsuccessfully attempted to have the concerts cancelled, citing amongst, other reasons, the bands&#x27; &quot;violent and anti-law enforcement philosophies&quot;. After Wu-Tang Clan failed to appear during a concert at Riverport, they were removed from the lineup and replaced with the Roots. Sony Records released &quot;Live &amp; Rare&quot;, compiling B-sides and live performances, in Japan in June 1998. A live video, &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot;, was released later the same year.

In 1999, Rage Against the Machine played at the Woodstock &#x27;99 concert. Their third album, &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot;, debuted at number one in 1999, selling 450,000 copies in the first week and was certified double-platinum. That year, the song &quot;Wake Up&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The track &quot;Calm Like a Bomb&quot; was used in the sequel, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; (2003). In 2000, the band planned to support the Beastie Boys on the &quot;Rhyme and Reason&quot; tour, but the tour was cancelled when the Beastie Boys drummer, Mike D, suffered a serious injury. In 2003, &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot; was ranked number 426 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

=== 2000–2001: Breakup ===
On January 26, 2000, during filming of the video for &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot;, directed by Michael Moore, an altercation caused the doors of the New York Stock Exchange to be closed and the band to be escorted from the site by security after band members attempted to gain entry into the exchange. The video shoot had attracted several hundred people, according to a representative for the city&#x27;s Deputy Commissioner for Public Information. New York City&#x27;s film office does not allow weekday film shoots on Wall Street. Moore had permission to use the steps of Federal Hall National Memorial but did not have a permit to shoot on the sidewalk or the street, nor did he have a loud-noise permit or the proper parking permits. &quot;Michael basically gave us one directorial instruction, &#x27;No matter what happens, don&#x27;t stop playing&#x27;&quot;, Tom Morello recalls. When the band left the steps, police officers apprehended Moore and led him away. Moore yelled to the band, &quot;Take the New York Stock Exchange!&quot; In an interview with the &quot;Socialist Worker&quot;, Morello said he and scores of others ran into the Stock Exchange. &quot;About two hundred of us got through the first set of doors, but our charge was stopped when the Stock Exchange&#x27;s titanium riot doors came crashing down.&quot; Moore said: &quot;For a few minutes, Rage Against the Machine was able to shut down American capitalism, an act that I am sure tens of thousands of downsized citizens would cheer.&quot;

On September 7, 2000, the band performed &quot;Testify&quot; at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. After the Best Rock Video award was given to Limp Bizkit, Commerford climbed onto the scaffolding of the set. He and his bodyguard were sentenced to a night in jail and De la Rocha reportedly left the awards after the stunt. Morello recalled that Commerford relayed his plan to the rest of the band before the show, and that both De la Rocha and Morello advised him against it immediately after Bizkit was presented the award.

On October 18, 2000, De la Rocha announced that he had left the band. He said, &quot;I feel that it is now necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed. It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, and from my perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal.&quot; Morello said, &quot;There was so much squabbling over everything, &quot;and I mean &quot;everything&quot;. We would even have fist fights over whether our T-shirts should be mauve or camouflaged! It was ridiculous. We were patently political, internally combustible. It was ugly for a long time.&quot; De la Rocha&#x27;s departure was voted the &quot;shittiest thing&quot; of 2000 in the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; readers&#x27; poll of that year.

The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Renegades&quot;, was a collection of covers of artists as diverse as Devo, EPMD, Minor Threat, Cypress Hill, the MC5, Afrika Bambaataa, the Rolling Stones, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Bruce Springsteen, the Stooges, and Bob Dylan. It achieved platinum status a month later. The following year saw the release of another live video, &quot;The Battle of Mexico City&quot;, while 2003 brought the live album &quot;Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium&quot;, an edited recording of the band&#x27;s final concerts on September 12 and 13, 2000, at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. It was accompanied by an expanded DVD release of the last show, which included a previously unreleased video for &quot;Bombtrack&quot;.
 In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the controversial 2001 Clear Channel memorandum contained a long list of what the memo termed &quot;lyrically questionable&quot; songs for the radio, uniquely listing &quot;all&quot; of Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s songs.

=== 2002—2006: Side projects ===
After the breakup, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford decided to stay together and find a new vocalist. &quot;There was talk for a while of us becoming Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s backing band, and even Macy Gray&#x27;s,&quot; said Morello. &quot;We informed that losing our singer was actually a blessing in disguise, and that we had bigger ambitions than being somebody&#x27;s hired musicians.&quot; Their friend, the producer Rick Rubin, suggested they play with Chris Cornell of Soundgarden. Along with Cornell, they formed Audioslave. Their first single, &quot;Cochise&quot;, was released in November 2002, and their self-titled debut album followed to mainly positive reviews. In contrast to Rage Against the Machine, most of Audioslave&#x27;s music was apolitical, although some songs touched on political issues. Their second album, &quot;Out of Exile&quot; debuted at the number one position on the Billboard charts in 2005. Audioslave released its third album &quot;Revelations&quot; on September 4, 2006, but did not tour as Cornell and Morello were working on solo albums. After months of inactivity and rumors of a breakup, Audioslave disbanded on February 15, 2007, after Cornell announced he was leaving the band &quot;due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences&quot;.

In 2003, Morello began playing acoustic folk music at open-mic nights and clubs under the alias the Nightwatchman, which he formed as an outlet for his political views while playing apolitical music with Audioslave. He participated in Billy Bragg&#x27;s Tell Us the Truth tour with no plans to record, but recorded a song for &quot;Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, &quot;No One Left&quot;. In April 2007, he released an album, &quot;One Man Revolution,&quot; followed by &quot;The Fabled City&quot; on September 30, 2008. Morello and the rapper Boots Riley formed the rap rock group Street Sweeper Social Club, and released their debut self-titled album in June 2009.

De la Rocha had been working on an album with DJ Shadow, Company Flow, Roni Size and Questlove, but dropped the project in favor of working with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. The album was not released. A collaboration between De la Rocha and DJ Shadow, the song &quot;March of Death&quot; was released free online in 2003 in protest of the imminent invasion of Iraq. The 2004 soundtrack &quot;Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; included one of the collaborations with Reznor, &quot;We Want It All&quot;. In late 2005, De la Rocha performed with the son jarocho band Son de Madera, singing and playing the jarana huasteca.

The band refused large sums of money to reunite for concerts and tours. Rumors of tension between De la Rocha and the others circulated. Commerford said that he and De la Rocha saw each other often and went surfing together. Morello said he and De la Rocha communicated by phone, and had met at a 2005 protest in support of the South Central Farm.

=== 2007–2008: First reunion and tours ===

On April 14, 2007, Morello and De la Rocha reunited to perform a brief acoustic set at a Coalition of Immokalee Workers rally in downtown Chicago. Morello described the event as &quot;very exciting for everybody in the room, myself included&quot;. Rage Against the Machine reunited to headline the final day of the 2007 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 29, in front of an EZLN backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival. Morello said they reunited to voice their opposition to the &quot;right-wing purgatory&quot; the United States had &quot;slid into&quot; under the George W. Bush administration since their dissolution.
Rage Against the Machine continued to tour in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan. They played a series of shows in Europe in 2008, including Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, Pinkpop Festival, T in the Park in Scotland, the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, the Reading and Leeds Festivals in England and the Oxegen Festival in Ireland. They also performed on August 2 in Chicago at the 2008 Lollapalooza festival.

Morello said they had no plans to record a new album, and said: &quot;Writing and recording albums is a whole different thing than getting back on the bike ... But I think that the one thing about the Rage catalog is that to me none of it feels dated. You know, it doesn&#x27;t feel at all like a nostalgia show. It feels like these are songs that were born and bred to be played now.&quot; De la Rocha said,&quot; As far as us recording music in the future, I don&#x27;t know where we all fit with that. We&#x27;ve all embraced each other&#x27;s projects and support them, and that&#x27;s great.&quot;

In July 2008, De la Rocha and the drummer Jon Theodore, formerly of the Mars Volta, released an EP as One Day as a Lion. In August 2008, during the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Rage headlined the free &quot;Tent State Music Festival to End the War&quot;. They were supported by Flobots, State Radio, Jello Biafra, and Wayne Kramer. Following the concert, the band, following uniformed veterans from the advocacy group Iraq Veterans Against the War, led the 8,000 attendees to the Denver Coliseum on a six-mile march to Invesco Field, host of the DNC. After a four-hour stand-off with police, the Obama campaign agreed to meet with members of Iraq Veterans Against the War and hear their demands.

In September 2008, Rage performed at the Target Center in Minneapolis during the Republican National Convention. The previous day, they attempted to play a surprise set at a free anti-RNC concert at the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul, but were prevented by the police. Instead, De la Rocha and Morello rapped and sang through a megaphone. Later that evening, Morello and Boots Reilly joined the songwriter Billy Bragg and the politician Jim Walsh for a three-hour jam session at Pepitos Parkway theater in south Minneapolis. In December 2008, Morello said his Nightwatchman project would be his &quot;principal musical focus, as I see it, for the remainder of my life&quot;. He repeated this point in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

=== 2009–2015: UK &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; Christmas campaign, European tour, and L.A. Rising ===
In December 2009, a campaign was launched on Facebook by Jon Morter and his wife Tracy, in order to stop, most notably, &quot;The X Factor&quot; hits from becoming almost automatic Christmas number ones on the UK Singles Chart. It generated nationwide publicity and took the track &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; to the coveted Christmas number one slot in the UK Singles Chart, which had been dominated for four consecutive years from 2005 by winners from the popular TV show &quot;The X Factor&quot;. Before the chart was announced on December 20, 2009, the Facebook group membership stood at over 950,000, and was acknowledged (and supported) by Tom Morello, Dave Grohl, Paul McCartney, Muse, Fightstar, &quot;NME&quot;, John Lydon, Bill Bailey, Lenny Henry, BBC Radio 1, Hadouken!, the Prodigy, Stereophonics, BBC Radio 5 Live, and even the 2004 &quot;X Factor&quot; winner Steve Brookstein, amongst numerous others. On the morning of December 17, Rage Against the Machine played a slightly censored version of &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; live on Radio 5 Live, but four repeats of &#x27;Fuck you I won&#x27;t do what you tell me&#x27; were aired before the song was pulled. During the interview before the song they reiterated their support for the campaign and their intentions to support charity with the proceeds. The campaign was ultimately successful, and &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; became the number-one single in the UK for Christmas 2009. Zack de la Rocha spoke to BBC One upon hearing the news, stating that:

The band also set a new record, achieving the biggest download sales total in a first week ever in the UK charts. De la Rocha also promised the band would perform a free concert in the UK sometime in 2010 to celebrate the achievement. True to their word, the band announced that they would be performing a free concert at Finsbury Park, London, on June 6, 2010. The concert, dubbed &quot;The Rage Factor&quot;, gave away all the tickets by free photo registration to prevent touting over the weekend of the February 13–14, followed by an online lottery on February 17. This proved to be popular, with many users facing connection issues. The tickets were all allocated by 13:30 that same day. After allowing ticket holders to vote for who they wanted to be the support acts for &quot;The Rage Factor&quot;, it was announced that Gogol Bordello, Gallows and Roots Manuva would support Rage Against the Machine at the concert.

In addition to the free gig at Finsbury Park, the band headlined European festivals in June 2010 including the Download Festival at Donington Park, England, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in Germany and Rock in Rio Madrid in Spain. They also performed in Ireland on June 8 and the Netherlands on June 9. Zack de la Rocha had stated that it was a definite possibility that the band would record a new album, the first time since 2000&#x27;s &quot;Renegades&quot;. Morter confirmed this, stating the discussions he and the band had backstage before the Finsbury Park gig saying the band did write new material, but they had no motivation to release them until now. De la Rocha mentioned the very strong reaction from the Download Festival 2010 audience as an incentive for releasing new material. In addition, the band returned to Los Angeles on July 23, 2010, for their first U.S. show in two years and their first hometown show in 10 years. The concert benefited Arizona organizations that are fighting the SB1070 immigration law. On the night of the show, a spokesperson announced to the crowd that ticket sales—all of which are non-profit to the bands—had raised $300,000. The band has been confirmed to do a short South American tour in October, performing at venues such as the SWU Festival in Brazil, the Maquinaria Festival in Chile, and Pepsi Music Festival in Argentina. It was the first time the band played in those countries.

After the &quot;Rage Factor&quot; celebratory show in Finsbury Park in London on June 6, 2010, after the campaign to get &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; to the No. 1 spot at Christmas, Zack de la Rocha stated that it was a &quot;genuine possibility&quot;. Stating that they may use the momentum from the campaign to get back into the studio and write a follow-up record to 2000&#x27;s &quot;Renegades&quot; after 10 years. When talking to NME, Zack de la Rocha said: &quot;I think it&#x27;s a genuine possibility, We have to get our heads around what we&#x27;re going to do towards the end of the year and finish up on some other projects and we&#x27;ll take it from there.&quot;

During an interview with the Chilean newspaper &quot;La Tercera&quot; in October 2010, De la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works, with a possibility of a 2011 release. De la Rocha is reported as saying, &quot;We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into the problems we faced 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: we are working on a new album due out next year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere&quot;. However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band was not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. &quot;The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio&quot;, Morello told &quot;The Pulse of Radio&quot;. &quot;We get along famously and we all, you know, intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there&#x27;s nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)&quot;. The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with El Gran Silencio, Immortal Technique, Lauryn Hill, Rise Against and Muse. During an interview on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello&#x27;s comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans for the next two years were in place.

In an October 2012 interview with TMZ, bassist Tim Commerford was asked if Rage Against the Machine was working on a new album. He simply responded, &quot;maybe&quot;. Asked by TMZ again in November 2012 whether a new album was being worked on, Commerford replied &quot;definitely maybe ... anything&#x27;s possible&quot;. Later that month, however, Morello denied that they were working on new material, and stated that Rage Against the Machine had &quot;no plans beyond&quot; the reissue of their self-titled debut album. Morello said he would be open to recording new Rage Against the Machine material, but added that it was &quot;not on the table right now&quot;.

The band announced on October 9 via their Facebook page that they would be releasing a special 20th anniversary box set to commemorate the group&#x27;s debut album. The full box set contains never-before-released concert material, including the band&#x27;s 2010 Finsbury Park show and footage from early in their career, as well as a digitally-remastered version of the album, B-sides and the original demo tape (on disc for the first time). The band released 3-disc and single-disc versions. The collection was released on November 27.

In an April 2014 interview with The Pulse of Radio, drummer Brad Wilk indicated that, as far as he knew, Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s 2011 performance at L.A. Rising was their final show. In February 2015, Tim Commerford said that uncertainty over when they might play again was typical of the band&#x27;s functioning, speculating: &quot;It could be tomorrow; it could be 10 years from now&quot;. On October 16, the 2010 performance in Finsbury Park was released on DVD and Blu-ray.

=== 2016–2019: Prophets of Rage ===

In May 2016, It was announced that Morello, Wilk and Commerford had formed a supergroup, Prophets of Rage, with the rappers Chuck D of Public Enemy and B-Real of Cypress Hill. The band toured through 2016 and played songs by Rage Against the Machine, Public Enemy and Cypress Hill. Commerford said that year that Rage Against the Machine had not split up. Morello said: &quot;We have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha [...] who is working on his own music, which I&#x27;m sure will be fantastic—he&#x27;s a great artist in his own right. But where you&#x27;re going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage.&quot; In May 2018, Wilk said Rage Against the Machine would make him happy, and that &quot;it&#x27;s just really a matter of getting us all on the same page&quot;. In November 2019, Chuck D and B-Real confirmed that Prophets of Rage had disbanded.

=== 2019–2024: Second reunion, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction and third disbandment ===

On November 1, 2019, it was reported that Rage Against the Machine were reuniting for their first shows in nine years in the spring of 2020, including two appearances at that year&#x27;s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. On November 25, 2019, an alleged leaked tour poster made its way online indicating the band would be going on a world tour throughout 2020. This was later debunked by Australian-based publication &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; who broke the news that a concert poster troll photoshopped and released it online as a prank.

On February 10, 2020, Rage Against the Machine announced more worldwide dates for the 2020 reunion tour, now named the Public Service Announcement Tour. It was scheduled to run from March 26 through September 12, making it the band&#x27;s first full-length world tour in 20 years, after they completed the promotional cycle for their third album &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot;. The supporting act on all shows but Chicago would be rap duo Run the Jewels. On March 12, 2020, the band postponed the first leg of the reunion tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic; this tour was eventually postponed to the summer of 2021. On May 1, 2020, the band announced that they had rescheduled the remaining dates of their reunion tour to 2021. They were also due to headline the Reading and Leeds Festivals, which would have been Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s first UK appearance in ten years, but it was announced on May 12, 2020, that the festival was cancelled. Despite having rescheduled all of their tour dates, Rage Against the Machine was initially still scheduled to play Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which had been postponed from April to October 2020 before it was officially cancelled that June. On April 8, 2021, it was announced that the Public Service Announcement Tour had once again been rescheduled to the spring and summer of 2022.

By June 11, 2020, every Rage Against the Machine album had entered the top 30 of Apple Music&#x27;s Rock Albums chart, and their debut album had entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 at number 174. The resurgence of interest in the band&#x27;s music and politics was widely attributed to renewed worldwide Black Lives Matter protests following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis by law enforcement.
On July 9, 2022, Rage Against the Machine played their first concert in 11 years at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin. After De la Rocha ruptured his Achilles tendon during a show in Chicago in July, Rage Against the Machine canceled their European tour and their remaining North American tour dates.

Rage Against the Machine was nominated for induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility in 2017, and again in 2018, 2019, and 2021. They were inducted on November 3, 2023, by Ice-T, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Only Morello attended the ceremony. On January 3, 2024, Wilk confirmed that Rage Against the Machine had disbanded again.

==Musical style and influences==
Inspired by early heavy metal instrumentation, Rage Against the Machine has been influenced by a variety of music, including acts like Rush, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, U2, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Iron Maiden, Kiss, Black Sabbath/Ozzy Osbourne, the Police, Devo, Living Colour, Queen, the Brothers Johnson and Wayne Shorter. They are also said to be influenced by hip hop acts such as Afrika Bambaataa, Run-DMC, Public Enemy, and the Beastie Boys, punk rock such as the Clash, Minor Threat, the Teen Idles, Bad Brains, the Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, the Sex Pistols, Fugazi and Bad Religion, and crossover bands like Suicidal Tendencies and Urban Dance Squad.

Rage Against the Machine has been noted for its &quot;fiercely polemical music, which brewed sloganeering leftist rants against corporate America, cultural imperialism, and government oppression into a Molotov cocktail of punk rock, hip hop, and thrash.&quot;

Zack de la Rocha&#x27;s lyrics and choruses are defined by a heavy use of sloganeering and repetition on songs like &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot;, &quot;Guerrilla Radio&quot;, &quot;Testify&quot;, and &quot;Down Rodeo&quot;. Guitarist Tom Morello was also considered the DJ of the group.

Rage Against the Machine has been described as rap metal, rap rock, funk metal, fusion, alternative metal, hard rock, nu metal, and alternative rock. Although the band has been described as nu metal, Rage Against the Machine is often instead considered a predecessor to nu metal.

==Political views and activism==
The members of Rage Against the Machine are well known for their leftist anti-authoritarian and revolutionary political views, and almost all of the band&#x27;s songs focus on these views. Key to the band&#x27;s identity, Rage Against the Machine has voiced viewpoints highly critical of the domestic and foreign policies of current and previous U.S. governments. Throughout its existence, Rage Against the Machine and its individual members participated in political protests and other activism to advocate these beliefs. The band sees its music as a vehicle for social activism; De la Rocha explained, &quot;I&#x27;m interested in spreading those ideas through art, because music has the power to cross borders, to break military sieges and to establish real dialogue.&quot;

Morello said of wage slavery in America:

Some critics have accused the group of hypocrisy for voicing commitment to leftist causes while being millionaires signed to Epic Records, a subsidiary of media conglomerate Sony Music. Infectious Grooves released a song called &quot;Do What I Tell Ya!&quot; which mocks lyrics from &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;, accusing the band of being hypocrites. In response to such critiques, Morello stated:

De la Rocha stated:

For their 2020 reunion tour, the band announced all profits from their first three shows—in El Paso, Texas; Las Cruces, New Mexico; and Glendale, Arizona—would be donated to immigrant rights organizations in the US. For subsequent shows, 10% of the base ticket price and 100% of proceeds after fees and base ticket price were reserved for charities local to each city they were performing in.

In May 2021, more than 600 musicians, including Rage Against the Machine, added their signature to the open letter calling for a boycott of performances in Israel until the occupation of the Palestinian territories comes to an end. Zack de la Rocha and Tom Morello voiced support for a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

On June 24, 2022, the band announced that they would donate $475,000 to reproductive rights groups in Wisconsin and Illinois after the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. During their July 9 concert in Wisconsin, the band further expressed opposition to overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; using screened images of text including &quot;Abort the Supreme Court&quot; and &quot;Forced birth in a country where black birth-givers experience maternal mortality two to three times higher than that of white birth-givers. Forced birth in a country where gun violence is the number one cause of death among children and teenagers.&quot;

<doc id="80028" wikidata="Q8272" url="?curid=80028" title="Epic of Gilgamesh">
<text>The Epic of Gilgamesh () is an epic from ancient Mesopotamia. The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh (formerly read as Sumerian &quot;Bilgames&quot;), king of Uruk, some of which may date back to the Third Dynasty of Ur (). These independent stories were later used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian. The first surviving version of this combined epic, known as the &quot;Old Babylonian&quot; version, dates back to the 18th century BCE and is titled after its incipit, Shūtur eli sharrī (&quot;Surpassing All Other Kings&quot;). Only a few tablets of it have survived. The later Standard Babylonian version compiled by Sîn-lēqi-unninni dates to somewhere between the 13th to the 10th centuries BCE and bears the incipit Sha naqba īmuru (&quot;He who Saw the Deep(s)&quot;, ). Approximately two-thirds of this longer, twelve-tablet version have been recovered. Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BCE Assyrian king Ashurbanipal.

The first half of the story discusses Gilgamesh (who was king of Uruk) and Enkidu, a wild man created by the gods to stop Gilgamesh from oppressing the people of Uruk. After Enkidu becomes civilized through sexual initiation with Shamhat, he travels to Uruk, where he challenges Gilgamesh to a test of strength. Gilgamesh wins the contest; nonetheless, the two become friends. Together, they make a six-day journey to the legendary Cedar Forest, where they ultimately slay its Guardian, Humbaba, and cut down the sacred Cedar. The goddess Ishtar sends the Bull of Heaven to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. Gilgamesh and Enkidu kill the Bull of Heaven, insulting Ishtar in the process, after which the gods decide to sentence Enkidu to death and kill him by giving him a fatal illness.

In the second half of the epic, distress over Enkidu&#x27;s death causes Gilgamesh to undertake a long and perilous journey to discover the secret of eternal life. Finally, he meets Utnapishtim, who with his wife were the only humans to survive the Flood triggered by the gods (cf. Athra-Hasis). Gilgamesh learns from him that &quot;Life, which you look for, you will never find. For when the gods created man, they let death be his share, and life withheld in their own hands&quot;. 

The epic is regarded as a foundational work in religion and the tradition of heroic sagas, with Gilgamesh forming the prototype for later heroes like Heracles (Hercules) and the epic itself serving as an influence for Homeric epics. It has been translated into many languages and is featured in several works of popular fiction.

== Discovery ==

About 15,000 fragments of Assyrian cuneiform tablets were discovered in the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh by Austen Henry Layard, his assistant Hormuzd Rassam, and W. K. Loftus in the early 1850s. Late in the following decade, the British Museum hired George Smith to study these; in 1872, Smith read translated fragments before the Society of Biblical Archaeology, and in 1875 and 1876 he published fuller translations, the latter of which was published as &quot;&quot;. The central character of Gilgamesh was initially reintroduced to the world as &quot;Izdubar&quot;, before the cuneiform logographs in his name could be pronounced accurately. In 1891, Paul Haupt collected the cuneiform text, and nine years later, Peter Jensen provided a comprehensive edition; R. Campbell Thompson updated both of their work in 1930. Over the next two decades, Samuel Noah Kramer reassembled the Sumerian poems.

In 1998, American Assyriologist Theodore Kwasman discovered a piece believed to have contained the first lines of the epic in the storeroom of the British Museum; the fragment, found in 1878 and dated to between 600 BCE and 100 BCE, had remained unexamined by experts for more than a century since its recovery. The fragment read &quot;He who saw all, who was the foundation of the land, who knew (everything), was wise in all matters: Gilgamesh.&quot; The discovery of artifacts () associated with Enmebaragesi of Kish, mentioned in the legends as the father of one of Gilgamesh&#x27;s adversaries, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh.

In the early 2000s, the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet was imported illegally into the United States. According to the United States Department of Justice, the tablet was encrusted with dirt and unreadable when it was purchased by a US antiquities dealer in 2003. The tablet was sold by an unnamed antiques dealer in 2007 with a letter falsely stating that it had been inside a box of ancient bronze fragments purchased in a 1981 auction. In 2014, Hobby Lobby privately purchased the tablet for display at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. In 2019, the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet was seized by US officials and was returned to Iraq in September 2021.

Recent developments in the use of Artificial Intelligence software have vastly accelerated the process of uncovering new fragments of the epic dispersed, and often unread, in museums around the world.

== Versions ==

Distinct sources exist from over a 2000-year timeframe. The earliest Sumerian poems are now generally considered to be distinct stories, rather than parts of a single epic. Some of these may date back to as early as the Third Dynasty of Ur (). The Old Babylonian tablets () are the earliest surviving tablets for a single &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; narrative. The older Old Babylonian tablets and later Akkadian version are important sources for modern translations, with the earlier texts mainly used to fill in gaps (lacunae) in the later texts. Although several revised versions based on new discoveries have been published, the epic remains incomplete. Analysis of the Old Babylonian text has been used to reconstruct possible earlier forms of the epic. The most recent Akkadian version, also referred to as the Standard Babylonian version, consists of twelve tablets and was edited by Sîn-lēqi-unninni, who is thought to have lived sometime between 1300 BCE and 1000 BCE.

From the diverse sources found, two main versions of the epic have been partially reconstructed: the Standard Babylonian version, or &quot;He who saw the deep&quot;, and the Old Babylonian version, or &quot;Surpassing all other kings&quot;. Five earlier Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh have been partially recovered, some with primitive versions of specific episodes in the Babylonian version, others with unrelated stories.

=== Standard Babylonian version ===
The Standard Babylonian version was discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in the library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh in 1853. &quot;Standard Babylonian&quot; refers to a literary style that was used for literary purposes. This version was compiled by Sin-leqi-unninni sometime between 1300 and 1000 BCE from earlier texts. One impact that Sin-leqi-unninni brought to the work was to bring the issue of mortality to the foreground, thus making it possible for the character to move from being an &quot;adventurer to a wise man.&quot; The Brazilian scholar Lins Brandão saw the standard version can be seen in this sense as &quot;sapiential literature,&quot; (&quot;wisdom literature&quot;), which is common in the Middle East, but this idea has not been widely accepted.
The Standard Babylonian version has different opening words, or incipit, from the older version. The older version begins with the words &quot;Surpassing all other kings&quot;, while the Standard Babylonian version has &quot;He who saw the deep&quot; (&quot;ša naqba īmuru&quot;), &quot;deep&quot; referring to the mysteries of the information brought back by Gilgamesh from his meeting with Uta-Napishti (Utnapishtim) about Ea, the fountain of wisdom. Gilgamesh was given knowledge of how to worship the gods, why death was ordained for human beings, what makes a good king, and how to live a good life. The story of Utnapishtim, the hero of the flood myth, can also be found in the Babylonian epic of &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot;. The Standard version is also known as &quot;iškar Gilgāmeš&quot;, &quot;Series of Gilgamesh&quot;.

The 12th tablet is a sequel to the original 11, and was probably appended at a later date. It bears little relation to the well-crafted 11-tablet epic; the lines at the beginning of the first tablet are quoted at the end of the 11th tablet, giving it circularity and finality. Tablet 12 is a near copy of an earlier Sumerian tale, a prequel, in which Gilgamesh sends Enkidu to retrieve some objects of his from the Underworld, and he returns in the form of a spirit to relate the nature of the Underworld to Gilgamesh.

In terms of form, the poetic conventions followed in the Standard Babylonian version appear to be inconsistent and are still controversial among scholars. There is, however, extensive use of parallelism across sets of two or three adjacent lines, much like in the Hebrew Psalms.

==== Genre ====

When it was discovered in the 19th century, the story of Gilgamesh was classified as a Greek epic, a genre known in Europe, even though it predates the Greek culture that spawned epics, specifically, when Herodotus referred to the works of Homer in this way. When Alfred Jeremias translated the text, he insisted on the relationship to Genesis by giving the title &quot;Izdubar-Nimrod&quot; and by recognizing the genre as that of Greek heroic poetry. Although the relationship to Nimrod was dropped, the view of &quot;Greek epic&quot; was retained. Martin Litchfield West, in 1966, in the preface to his edition of Hesiod, recognized the proximity of the Greeks to the middle eastern center of convergence: &quot;Greek literature is a Near East literature.&quot;

Considering how the text would be viewed from the standpoint of its time is tricky, as George Smith acknowledges that there is no &quot;Sumerian or Akkadian word for myth or heroic narrative, just as there is no ancient recognition of poetic narrative as a genre.&quot; suggested, though with little supporting evidence, that the prologue of &quot;He who Saw the Abyss&quot; recalls the inspiration of the Greek Muses, even though there is no assistance from the Sumerian gods here. In more popular treatments, Sir Jonathan Sacks, Neil McGregor, and BBC Radio 4 interpret the Epic of Gilgamesh&#x27;s flood myth as having a pantheon of gods who are misanthropes willing to condemn humanity to death, with the exception of Ea. Such an interpretation is an unhelpful contemporary take on Mesopotamia&#x27;s polytheistic religion (and on polytheistic systems more generally), in which the gods may be helpful or harmful in diverse situations.

It is also made explicit that Gilgamesh rose to the rank of an &quot;ancient wise man&quot; (antediluvian). Lins Brandão continues, noting how the poem would have been &quot;put on a stele&quot; (&quot;narû&quot;), that at first &quot;narû&quot; could be seen as the genre of the poem, taking into consideration that the reader (or scribe) would have to pass the text on, without omitting or adding anything.

==== Content of the Standard Babylonian version tablets ====
This summary is based on Andrew George&#x27;s translation.

===== Tablet one =====
The story introduces Gilgamesh, king of Uruk. Gilgamesh, two-thirds god and one-third man, is oppressing his people, who cry out to the gods for help. For the young women of Uruk this oppression takes the form of Gilgamesh raping brides on their wedding night. For the young men (the tablet is damaged at this point) it is conjectured that Gilgamesh exhausts them through games, tests of strength, or perhaps forced labour on building projects. The gods respond to the people&#x27;s pleas by creating an equal to Gilgamesh who will be able to stop his oppression. 

This is the invincibly strong Enkidu, covered in hair, who lives in the wilderness with his herd of animal relatives. He is spotted by a trapper, whose livelihood is being ruined because Enkidu destroys all his traps. The trapper tells the sun god Shamash about the man, and it is arranged that Enkidu will be seduced by Shamhat, a temple prostitute, as the first step in taming him. After six days and seven nights (or two weeks, according to more recent scholarship) of lovemaking, Enkidu is &#x27;weakened&#x27;; his herd flees in horror into the steppe. Enkidu is shocked by his loneliness, but Shamhat tries to comfort him: &quot;Do not grieve, you now have knowledge, like the gods. Gilgamesh, meanwhile, has been having dreams about the imminent arrival of a beloved new companion and asks his mother, the goddess Ninsun, to help interpret these dreams.

===== Tablet two =====

Shamhat takes Enkidu to a shepherd&#x27;s camp, teaching him to be civilised: his hair is cut, and he learns to eat human food and drink beer. In the shepherds&#x27; camp, to whose way of life he has become accustomed, Enkidu is appointed night watchman. Learning from a passing stranger about Gilgamesh&#x27;s treatment of new brides, he is incensed and travels to Uruk to intervene at a wedding. When Gilgamesh attempts to visit the wedding chamber, Enkidu blocks his way, and they fight. After a fierce battle, Enkidu acknowledges Gilgamesh&#x27;s superior strength and they become friends. Gilgamesh proposes a journey to the Cedar Forest to slay the monstrous demi-god Humbaba in order to gain fame and renown. Despite warnings from Enkidu and the council of elders, Gilgamesh is not deterred.

===== Tablet three =====
The elders give Gilgamesh advice for his journey. Gilgamesh visits his mother, Ninsun, who seeks the support and protection of the sun-god Shamash for their adventure. Ninsun adopts Enkidu as her son, and Gilgamesh leaves instructions for the governance of Uruk in his absence.

===== Tablet four =====

Gilgamesh and Enkidu journey to the Cedar Forest. Every few days they camp on a mountain, and perform a dream ritual. Gilgamesh has five terrifying dreams about falling mountains, thunderstorms, wild bulls, and a thunderbird that breathes fire. Despite similarities between his dream figures and earlier descriptions of Humbaba, Enkidu interprets these dreams as good omens, and denies that the frightening images represent the forest guardian. As they approach the cedar mountain, they hear Humbaba bellowing, and have to encourage each other not to be afraid.

===== Tablet five =====
The heroes enter the cedar forest. Humbaba, the guardian of the Cedar Forest, insults and threatens them. He accuses Enkidu of betrayal, and vows to disembowel Gilgamesh and feed his flesh to the birds. Gilgamesh is afraid, but with some encouraging words from Enkidu the battle commences. The mountains quake with the tumult and the sky turns black. The god Shamash sends 13 winds to bind Humbaba, and he is captured. Humbaba pleads for his life, and Gilgamesh pities him. He offers to make Gilgamesh king of the forest, to cut the trees for him, and to be his slave. Enkidu, however, argues that Gilgamesh should kill Humbaba to establish his reputation forever. Humbaba curses them both and Gilgamesh dispatches him with a blow to the neck, as well as killing his seven sons. The two heroes cut down many cedars, including a gigantic tree that Enkidu plans to fashion into a door for the temple of Enlil. They build a raft and return home along the Euphrates with the giant tree and (possibly) the head of Humbaba.

===== Tablet six =====
Gilgamesh rejects the advances of the goddess Ishtar because of her mistreatment of previous lovers like Dumuzi. Ishtar becomes angry and denies Gilgamesh entry into E-Ana, interfering with his business. Ishtar asks her father Anu to send Gulaana- the Bull of Heaven to avenge her. When Anu rejects her complaints, Ishtar threatens to raise the dead who will &quot;outnumber the living&quot; and &quot;devour them&quot;, as well as screaming loud enough to be heard by the heavens and earth. Anu states that if he gives her the Bull of Heaven, Uruk will face 7 years of famine. Ishtar provides him with provisions for 7 years in exchange for the bull. Ishtar leads the Bull of Heaven to Uruk, and he causes widespread devastation. Drinking continuously without being satisfied, the Bull lowers the level of the Euphrates river, and dries up the marshes. He opens up huge pits that swallow 300 men. Without any divine assistance, Enkidu and Gilgamesh kill him and offer up his heart to Shamash. When Ishtar cries out, Enkidu hurls one of the hindquarters of the bull at her. The city of Uruk celebrates, but Enkidu has an ominous dream about his future failure.

===== Tablet seven =====
In Enkidu&#x27;s dream, the gods decide that one of the heroes must die because they killed Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven. Despite the protestations of Shamash, Enkidu is marked for death. Enkidu curses the great door he has fashioned for Enlil&#x27;s temple. He also curses the trapper and Shamhat for removing him from the wild. Shamash reminds Enkidu of how Shamhat fed and clothed him, and introduced him to Gilgamesh. Shamash tells him that Gilgamesh will bestow great honors upon him at his funeral, and will wander into the wild consumed with grief. Enkidu regrets his curses and blesses Shamhat instead. In a second dream, however, he sees himself being taken captive to the Netherworld, a &quot;house of dust&quot; and darkness whose inhabitants eat clay, and are clothed in bird feathers, supervised by terrifying beings. For 12 days, Enkidu&#x27;s condition worsens. Finally, after a lament that he could not meet a heroic death in battle, he dies. In a famous line from the epic, Gilgamesh clings to Enkidu&#x27;s body and denies that he has died until a maggot drops from the nose of the corpse.

===== Tablet eight =====
Gilgamesh delivers a lament for Enkidu, in which he calls upon mountains, forests, fields, rivers, wild animals, and all of Uruk to mourn for his friend. Recalling their adventures together, Gilgamesh tears at his hair and clothes in grief. He commissions a funerary statue, and provides grave gifts from his treasury to ensure that Enkidu has a favourable reception in the realm of the dead. A great banquet is held where the treasures are offered to the gods of the Netherworld. Just before a break in the text there is a suggestion that a river is being dammed, indicating a burial in a river bed, as in the corresponding Sumerian poem, &quot;The Death of Gilgamesh&quot;.

===== Tablet nine =====
 Tablet nine opens with Gilgamesh roaming the wild wearing skins, grieving for Enkidu. Having now become fearful of his own death, he decides to seek Utnapishtim (&quot;the Faraway&quot;), and learn the secret of eternal life. Utnapishtim and his wife are the only couple of humans artificially created by the gods who were allowed to survive the great flood and even endowed with divine immortality in gratitude for food sacrifices to the gods, so Utnapishtim seems to be identical to the pious priest Atra-Hasis. 

Gilgamesh crosses a mountain pass at night and encounters a pride of lions. Before sleeping he prays for protection to the moon god Sin. Then, waking from an encouraging dream, he kills the lions and uses their skins for clothing. After a long and perilous journey, Gilgamesh arrives at the twin peaks of Mount Mashu at the western end of the earth. He comes across the tunnel of the sun god Shamash, which no man has ever entered, guarded by two scorpion monsters, who appear to be a married couple. The husband tries to dissuade Gilgamesh from passing, but the wife intervenes, expresses sympathy for Gilgamesh, and (according to the poem&#x27;s editor Benjamin Foster) allows his passage. Entering the tunnel&#x27;s gate, he follows the path of Shamash in total darkness and actually manages to reach the eastern exit within 12 ‘double hours’, just before he would have been caught up by the sun god, burning him alive. Astonished, he enters the marvellous Garden of the Gods, a paradise in which trees full of delicious jewels grow.

===== Tablet ten =====
Gilgamesh meets alewife Siduri in her pub. First she assumes that he would be a murderer or thief because of his disheveled appearance, but Gilgamesh tells her about the purpose of his journey. She attempts to dissuade him from his quest, but sends him to Urshanabi the ferryman, who will help him cross the sea to Utnapishtim. Gilgamesh, out of spontaneous rage, destroys the stone charms that Urshanabi keeps with him. Gilgamesh tells his story, but when he asks for help, Urshanabi informs him that he has just destroyed the objects that can help them cross the Waters of Death, which are deadly to the touch. Urshanabi instructs Gilgamesh to cut down 120 trees and fashion them into punting poles. When they reach the island where Utnapishtim lives, Gilgamesh recounts his story, asking him for his help. Utnapishtim reprimands him, declaring that fighting the common fate of humans is futile and diminishes life&#x27;s joys.

===== Tablet eleven =====

 Gilgamesh observes that Utnapishtim seems no different from himself, and asks him how he obtained his immortality. Utnapishtim explains that the gods decided to send a great flood. To save Utnapishtim the god Enki told him to build a boat. He gave him precise dimensions, and it was sealed with pitch and bitumen. His entire family went aboard together with his craftsmen and &quot;all the animals of the field&quot;. A violent storm then arose which caused the terrified gods to retreat to the heavens. Ishtar lamented the wholesale destruction of humanity, and the other gods wept beside her. The storm lasted six days and nights, after which &quot;all the human beings turned to clay&quot;. Utnapishtim weeps when he sees the destruction. His boat lodges on the Mt. Nimush, and he releases a dove, a swallow, and a raven. When the raven fails to return, he opens the ark and frees its inhabitants. Utnapishtim offers a sacrifice to the gods, who smell the sweet savor and gather around. Ishtar vows that just as she will never forget the brilliant necklace that hangs around her neck, she will always remember this time. When Enlil arrives, angry that there are survivors, she condemns him for instigating the flood. Enki also castigates him for sending a disproportionate punishment. Enlil blesses Utnapishtim and his wife, and rewards them with eternal life. This account largely matches the flood story that concludes the &quot;Epic of &quot;.

The main point seems to be that when Enlil granted eternal life it was a unique gift. As if to demonstrate this point, Utnapishtim challenges Gilgamesh to stay awake for six days and seven nights. Gilgamesh falls asleep, and Utnapishtim instructs his wife to bake a loaf of bread on each of the days he is asleep, so that he cannot deny his failure to keep awake. Gilgamesh, who is seeking to overcome death, cannot even conquer sleep. After instructing Urshanabi, the ferryman, to wash Gilgamesh and clothe him in royal robes, they depart for Uruk.
As they are leaving, Utnapishtim&#x27;s wife asks her husband to offer a parting gift. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that at the bottom of the sea there lives a boxthorn-like plant that will make him young again. Gilgamesh, by binding stones to his feet so he can walk on the bottom, manages to obtain the plant. Gilgamesh proposes to investigate if the plant has the hypothesized rejuvenation ability by testing it on an old man once he returns to Uruk.
When Gilgamesh stops to bathe, it is stolen by a serpent, who sheds its skin as it departs. Gilgamesh weeps at the futility of his efforts, because he has now lost all chance of immortality. He returns to Uruk, where the sight of its massive walls prompts him to praise this enduring work to Urshanabi.

===== Tablet twelve =====
This tablet is mainly an Akkadian translation of an earlier Sumerian poem, &quot;Gilgamesh and the Netherworld&quot; (also known as &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld&quot; and variants), although it has been suggested that it is derived from an unknown version of that story. The contents of this last tablet are inconsistent with previous ones: Enkidu is still alive, despite having died earlier in the epic. Because of this, its lack of integration with the other tablets, and the fact that it is almost a copy of an earlier version, it has been referred to as an &#x27;inorganic appendage&#x27; to the epic. Alternatively, it has been suggested that &quot;its purpose, though crudely handled, is to explain to Gilgamesh (and the reader) the various fates of the dead in the Afterlife&quot; and in &quot;an awkward attempt to bring closure&quot;, it both connects the Gilgamesh of the epic with the Gilgamesh who is the King of the Netherworld, and is &quot;a dramatic capstone whereby the twelve-tablet epic ends on one and the same theme, that of &quot;seeing&quot; (= understanding, discovery, etc.), with which it began.&quot;

Gilgamesh complains to Enkidu that various of his possessions (the tablet is unclear exactly what different translations include a drum and a ball) have fallen into the underworld. Enkidu offers to bring them back. Delighted, Gilgamesh tells Enkidu what he must and must not do in the underworld if he is to return. Enkidu does everything which he was told not to do. The underworld keeps him. Gilgamesh prays to the gods to give him back his friend. Enlil and Suen do not reply, but Enki and Shamash decide to help. Shamash makes a crack in the earth, and Enkidu&#x27;s ghost jumps out of it. The tablet ends with Gilgamesh questioning Enkidu about what he has seen in the underworld.

=== Old Babylonian versions ===
This version of the epic, called in some fragments &quot;Surpassing all other kings&quot;, is composed of tablets and fragments from diverse origins and states of conservation. It remains incomplete in its majority, with several tablets missing, and those found having sizable lacunae. They are named after their current location or the place where they were found.

==== Pennsylvania tablet ====
&quot;Surpassing all other kings&quot; Tablet II, greatly correlates with tablets I–II of the Standard Babylonian version.
Gilgamesh tells his mother Ninsun about two dreams he had. His mother explains that they mean that a new companion will soon arrive at Uruk. In the meanwhile the wild Enkidu and the priestess (here called Shamkatum) have sex. She tames him in company of the shepherds by offering him bread and beer. Enkidu helps the shepherds by guarding the sheep. They travel to Uruk to confront Gilgamesh and stop his abuses. Enkidu and Gilgamesh battle but Gilgamesh breaks off the fight. Enkidu praises Gilgamesh.

==== Yale tablet ====
&quot;Surpassing all other kings&quot; Tablet III, partially matches tablets II–III of the Standard Babylonian version.
For reasons unknown (the tablet is partially broken) Enkidu is in a sad mood. In order to cheer him up Gilgamesh suggests going to the Pine Forest to cut down trees and kill Humbaba (known here as Huwawa). Enkidu protests, as he knows Huwawa and is aware of his power. Gilgamesh talks Enkidu into it with some words of encouragement, but Enkidu remains reluctant. They prepare, and call for the elders. The elders also protest, but after Gilgamesh talks to them, they agree to let him go. After Gilgamesh asks his god (Shamash) for protection, and both he and Enkidu equip themselves, they leave with the elders&#x27; blessing and counsel.

==== Philadelphia fragment ====
Possibly another version of the contents of the Yale Tablet, practically irrecoverable.

==== Nippur school tablet ====
In the journey to the cedar forest and Huwawa, Enkidu interprets one of Gilgamesh&#x27;s dreams.

==== Tell Harmal tablets ====
Fragments from two different versions/tablets tell how Enkidu interprets one of Gilgamesh&#x27;s dreams on the way to the Forest of Cedar, and their conversation when entering the forest.

==== Ishchali tablet ====
After defeating Huwawa, Gilgamesh refrains from slaying him, and urges Enkidu to hunt Huwawa&#x27;s &quot;seven auras&quot;. Enkidu convinces him to smite their enemy. After killing Huwawa and the auras, they chop down part of the forest and discover the gods&#x27; secret abode. The rest of the tablet is broken.

The auras are not referred to in the Standard Babylonian version, but are in one of the Sumerian poems as &quot;sons&quot;.

==== Partial fragment in Baghdad ====
Partially overlapping the felling of the trees from the Ishchali tablet.

==== Sippar tablet ====
Partially overlapping the Standard Babylonian version tablets IX–X.
Gilgamesh mourns the death of Enkidu wandering in his quest for immortality. Gilgamesh argues with Shamash about the futility of his quest. After a lacuna, Gilgamesh talks to Siduri about his quest and his journey to meet Utnapishtim (here called Uta-na&#x27;ishtim). Siduri attempts to dissuade Gilgamesh in his quest for immortality, urging him to be content with the simple pleasures of life. After one more lacuna, Gilgamesh smashes the &quot;stone ones&quot; and talks to the ferryman Urshanabi (here called Sur-sunabu). After a short discussion, Sur-sunabu asks him to carve 300 oars so that they may cross the waters of death without needing the &quot;stone ones&quot;. The rest of the tablet is missing.

The text on the Old Babylonian Meissner fragment (the larger surviving fragment of the Sippar tablet) has been used to reconstruct possible earlier forms of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, and it has been suggested that a &quot;prior form of the story – earlier even than that preserved on the Old Babylonian fragment – may well have ended with Siduri sending Gilgamesh back to Uruk...&quot; and &quot;Utnapistim was not originally part of the tale.&quot;

=== Sumerian poems ===
There are five extant Gilgamesh stories in the form of older poems in Sumerian. These probably circulated independently, rather than being in the form of a unified epic. Some of the names of the main characters in these poems differ slightly from later Akkadian names; for example, &quot;Bilgames&quot; is written instead of &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;, and there are some differences in the underlying stories such as the fact that Enkidu is Gilgamesh&#x27;s servant in the Sumerian version:
# &quot;Gilgamesh and Huwawa&quot; (incipit: &quot;The lord went to the Living One&#x27;s Mountain&quot;) and &quot;Ho, hurrah!&quot; correspond to the Cedar Forest episode (Standard Babylonian version tablets II–V). Gilgamesh and Enkidu travel with other men to the Forest of Cedar. There, trapped by Huwawa, Gilgamesh tricks him (with Enkidu&#x27;s assistance in one of the versions) into giving up his auras, thus losing his power.
# &quot;Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven&quot; (incipit: &quot;Hero in battle&quot;) corresponds to the Bull of Heaven episode (Standard Babylonian version tablet VI) in the Akkadian version. The Bull&#x27;s voracious appetite causes drought and hardship in the land while Gilgamesh feasts. Lugalgabagal convinces him to face the Bull and attacks him alongside Enkidu.
# &quot;Gilgamesh and Aga&quot; (incipit: &quot;The envoys of Aga&quot; or &quot;Akka&quot;) has no corresponding episode in the epic, but the themes of whether to show mercy to captives, and counsel from the city elders, also occur in the Standard Babylonian version of the Humbaba story. In the poem, Uruk faces a siege from a Kish army led by King Akka, whom Gilgamesh defeats and forgives.
# &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld&quot; (incipit: &quot;In those days, in those far-off days&quot;) is the source for the Akkadian translation included as tablet XII in the Standard Babylonian version, telling of Enkidu&#x27;s journey to the Netherworld. It is also the main source of information for the Eridu Genesis and the story of &quot;Inanna and the &quot;Huluppu&quot; Tree&quot;.
# &quot;Death of Gilgamesh&quot; (incipit: &quot;The great wild bull is lying down&quot;), a poem about Gilgamesh&#x27;s death, burial and consecration as a semigod, reigning and giving judgement over the dead. After dreaming of how the gods decide his fate after death, Gilgamesh takes counsel, prepares his funeral and offers gifts to the gods. Once deceased, he is buried under the Euphrates, taken off its course and later returned to it.

=== Translations ===
The first direct Arabic translation from the original tablets was published in the 1960s by Iraqi archaeologist Taha Baqir.

The definitive modern translation into English is a two-volume critical work by Andrew George, published by Oxford University Press in 2003. A book review by Cambridge scholar Eleanor Robson claims that George&#x27;s is the most significant critical work on Gilgamesh in the last 70 years. George discusses the state of the surviving material, and provides a tablet-by-tablet exegesis, with a dual language side-by-side translation.

In 2004, Stephen Mitchell supplied a controversial version that takes many liberties with the text and includes modernized allusions and commentary relating to the Iraq War of 2003.

In 2021, a translation by Sophus Helle was published by Yale University Press.

== Later influence ==
=== Relationship to the Bible ===
Various themes, plot elements, and characters in the Hebrew Bible have been suggested to correlate with the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;notably, the accounts of the Garden of Eden, the advice from Ecclesiastes, and the Genesis flood narrative.

==== Garden of Eden ====
The parallels between the stories of Enkidu/Shamhat and Adam/Eve have been long recognized by scholars. In both, a human is created from the soil by a god and lives in nature. He is introduced to a female congener who tempts him. In both stories the man accepts food from the woman, covers his nakedness, and must leave his former home, unable to return. The presence of a snake who steals a plant of immortality from the hero later in the epic is another point of similarity. However, a major difference between the two stories is that while Enkidu experiences regret regarding his seduction away from nature, this is only temporary: After being confronted by the god Shamash for being ungrateful, Enkidu recants and decides to give the woman who seduced him his final blessing before he dies. This is in contrast to Adam, whose fall from grace is largely portrayed as a punishment for disobeying God and the inevitable consequence of the loss of innocence regarding good and evil.

==== Advice from Ecclesiastes ====
Several scholars suggest direct borrowing of Siduri&#x27;s advice by the author of Ecclesiastes.

A rare proverb about the strength of a triple-stranded rope, &quot;a triple-stranded rope is not easily broken&quot;, is common to both books. 

==== Noah&#x27;s flood ====
Andrew George submits that the Genesis flood narrative matches that in Gilgamesh so closely that &quot;few doubt&quot; that it derives from a Mesopotamian account. What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; flood tale &quot;point by point and in the same order&quot;, even when the story permits other alternatives. In a 2001 Torah commentary released on behalf of the Conservative Movement of Judaism, rabbinic scholar Robert Wexler stated: &quot;The most likely assumption we can make is that both Genesis and Gilgamesh drew their material from a common tradition about the flood that existed in Mesopotamia. These stories then diverged in the retelling.&quot; Ziusudra, Utnapishtim and Noah are the respective heroes of the Sumerian, Akkadian and biblical flood legends of the ancient Near East.

==== Additional biblical parallels ====
Matthias Henze suggests that Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s madness in the biblical Book of Daniel draws on the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. He claims that the author uses elements from the description of Enkidu to paint a sarcastic and mocking portrait of the king of Babylon.

Many characters in the Epic have biblical parallels, most notably Ninti, the Sumerian goddess of life, was created from Enki&#x27;s rib to heal him after he had eaten forbidden flowers. It is suggested that this story served as the basis for the story of Eve created from Adam&#x27;s rib in the Book of Genesis. Esther J. Hamori, in &quot;Echoes of Gilgamesh in the Jacob Story&quot;, also claims that the story of Jacob and Esau is paralleled with the wrestling match between Gilgamesh and Enkidu.

==== Book of Giants ====
Gilgamesh is mentioned in one version of &quot;The Book of Giants&quot; which is related to the Book of Enoch. The Book of Giants version found at Qumran mentions the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh and the monster Humbaba with the Watchers and giants.

=== Influence on Homer ===
Numerous scholars have drawn attention to various themes, episodes, and verses, indicating that the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; had a substantial influence on both of the epic poems ascribed to Homer. These influences are detailed by Martin Litchfield West in &quot;The East Face of Helicon: West Asiatic Elements in Greek Poetry and Myth&quot;. According to Tzvi Abusch of Brandeis University, the poem &quot;combines the power and tragedy of the &quot;Iliad&quot; with the wanderings and marvels of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. It is a work of adventure, but is no less a meditation on some fundamental issues of human existence.&quot; Martin West, in &quot;The East face of Helicon&quot;, speculates that the memory of Gilgamesh would have reached the Greeks through a lost poem about Heracles.

=== Alexander legends ===
In the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; and many subsequent legends of Alexander the Great, Alexander is on a quest to find the Fountain of Life and become immortal. This was inspired by myths of Gilgamesh&#x27;s quest for eternal youth in the face of his mortality; despite the influence, there are two main differences. The first is that Gilgamesh seeks the plant of youth whereas Alexander seeks the water of life. The second is that the motif of the snake shedding its skin in the Gilgamesh legend is replaced in the Alexander legend by a fish returning to life upon being washed in the fountain. The reasons for these differences was due to the Christianizing force involved in the adaptation of the Gilgamesh legends.

=== In popular culture ===
The &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; has inspired many works of literature, art, and music. It was only after World War I that the &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; epic reached a modern audience, and only after World War II that it was featured in a variety of genres. Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s 1997 anime film &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is partially based on the Cedar Forest episode of &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;.

<text>The Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 was one of the most famous and influential strikes in Canadian history. For six weeks, May 15 to June 26, more than 30,000 strikers brought economic activity to a standstill in Winnipeg, Manitoba, which at the time was Canada&#x27;s third largest city. In the short term, the strike ended in arrests, bloodshed and defeat, but in the long run it contributed to the development of a stronger labour movement and the tradition of social democratic politics in Canada.

== Causes of the strike ==
There were many background causes for the strike, most of them related to the prevailing social inequalities and the impoverished condition of the city&#x27;s working class. Wages were low, prices were rising, employment was unstable, immigrants faced discrimination, housing and health conditions were poor. In addition, there was resentment of the enormous profits enjoyed by employers during the war. Soldiers returning from the war were determined to see improved social conditions and opportunities after their harrowing experiences overseas. Most workers did not have union representation, but many were influenced by the hope of achieving greater economic security through unions. 

Many workers were also influenced by socialist ideas voiced by local reformers, radicals and revolutionaries. These attracted greater interest, especially among the large population of immigrants from Eastern Europe, after the Russian Revolution of 1917. A meeting of western labour delegates in Calgary in March 1919 adopted numerous radical resolutions, including support for a five-day week and a six-hour day. They also called for the establishment of a new union centre, the One Big Union, to promote class solidarity by uniting workers from all trades and industries in one organization. The idea that the OBU instigated the general strike is misleading, as the OBU was not formed until June 1919. However, the &quot;one big union&quot; idea contributed to the atmosphere of unrest. Similar volatile conditions existed elsewhere in Canada, and in other countries around the world, at the end of World War I, but the combination of circumstances in Winnipeg proved to be explosive.

The most immediate cause of the strike involved support for collective bargaining in the metal trades and building trades, where workers were attempting to negotiate contracts through their trades councils. When the Metal Trades Council and the Building Trades Council had both failed to secure contracts with employers by the end of April, they went on strike, the building trades on May 1 and the metal trades on May 2. Shortly afterwards, the situation was discussed at meetings of the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council, the umbrella body for the city&#x27;s unions. The Labour Council decided to call on their 12,000 affiliated members to vote on a proposal for a general strike. On a smaller scale, this tactic had achieved success for striking city workers a year earlier in 1918. Preliminary results of the vote among the Labour Council&#x27;s member unions were announced on May 13. The outcome showed overwhelming support for a general strike, 8,667 to 645. Ernest Robinson, secretary of the Labour Council, issued a statement that &quot;every organization but one has voted in favour of the general strike&quot; and that &quot;all public utilities will be tied-up in order to enforce the principle of collective bargaining&quot;. A Strike Committee was established, with delegates elected by the city&#x27;s unions. The leadership included both moderate trade unionists, such as James Winning, a bricklayer who was president of the Trades and Labour Council, and socialists such as R.B. Russell, a machinist who favoured the OBU.

==1919 general strike==

===Organization===
At 11 am on Thursday, May 15, 1919, virtually the entire working population of Winnipeg went on strike. Somewhere around 30,000 workers in the public and private sectors walked off their jobs, and the city experienced a sudden cessation of many normal activities. The Strike Committee requested the police force, who had voted in favour of the strike, to remain on duty. Workers at the city waterworks also remained on the job to provide service at reduced pressure. Union membership had increased substantially during the spring of 1919, but most of the people who came out in support of the general strike were not union members. For instance, the first to leave work, at 7:00 a.m., were the telephone operators, the so-called &quot;hello girls&quot; at the city telephone exchanges, who were not at this time union members. Also on the first day of the strike, the major organizations of returned soldiers announced their support and were active throughout the six weeks of the strike.

In the early days of the strike, according to historian David Bercuson, &quot;The atmosphere was almost festive, the belief in ultimate victory strong.&quot; Participants assembled in city parks to listen to speakers report on the progress of the strike and discuss the many related social reform issues of the time. To ensure that strikers were kept informed of developments, the Strike Committee also published a daily &quot;Strike Bulletin&quot;. This newspaper urged the strikers to remain peaceable as well as idle: &quot;The only thing the workers have to do to win this strike is to do nothing. Just eat, sleep, play, love, laugh, and look at the sun... Our fight consists of doing no fighting.&quot;

Women leaders played an important part in building solidarity among the strikers. Experienced organizers such as Helen &quot;Ma&quot; Armstrong, one of two women on the Strike Committee, encouraged young working women to join the strike and often spoke on street corners and at public meetings. The Women&#x27;s Labour League raised money to help women workers pay rent. They also set up a kitchen where hundreds of meals were served every day. On June 12 a &quot;ladies day&quot; was held at Victoria Park, where women occupied seats of honour to cheer a speech by J.S. Woodsworth promoting the emancipation of women and the equality of the sexes. An emerging working-class activist named Edith Hancox, who became a notable defender of the city&#x27;s dispossessed during the 1920s, is the only woman reported as a speaker at the huge outdoor gatherings at Victoria Park. 

Negotiations between members of the Strike Committee, city council and local businesses produced an arrangement to continue milk and bread deliveries. To make it clear that the delivery men were not strikebreakers, a small poster was printed for display on their wagons reading &quot;PERMITTED BY AUTHORITY OF STRIKE COMMITTEE.&quot; Although the cards were suggested by management, they were also attacked as evidence that the Strike Committee was taking control of the city.

===Opposition===
In a city divided on class lines, opposition to the strike was led by a group of local businessmen and professionals who described themselves as the Citizens&#x27; Committee of One Thousand. From their headquarters in the Board of Trade building, they encouraged employers not to give in to the strikers and attempted to stir up resentment of &quot;alien&quot; immigrants, who, they charged, were the principal leaders of the strike. They also put pressure on governments to take action against the strike. They published a newspaper, &quot;The Winnipeg Citizen&quot;, that claimed that &quot;the so-called general strike is in reality revolution – or a daring attempt to overthrow the present industrial and governmental system.&quot;

At the end of the first week of the strike, two federal cabinet ministers arrived in Winnipeg to assess the situation, acting Minister of Justice Arthur Meighen and Minister of Labour Gideon Robertson. They refused to meet with the Strike Committee, but consulted with the Citizens&#x27; Committee, who greatly influenced their conclusions. Meighen issued a statement that the strike was &quot;a cloak for something far deeper—an effort to &#x27;overturn&#x27; the proper authority&quot;. Robertson reported back to Ottawa that &quot;the motive behind this strike undoubtedly was the overthrow of Constitutional Government.&quot; They warned striking postal workers, who were federal employees, to return to work or lose their jobs.  At this time, they also authorized the local government to use the armed forces and the Royal Northwest Mounted Police as needed. In preparation for arrests, at the beginning of June, and on the advice of one of the leaders of the Citizens&#x27; Committee, A.J. Andrews, the federal government amended the Immigration Act to allow for the deportation without trial of any British citizens not born in Canada who were charged with seditious activity.

The municipal government also took action. As large numbers of veterans were holding marches in the streets in support of the strike, on June 5 Mayor Charles F. Gray announced a ban on public demonstrations. On June 9 the city also dismissed almost the entire police force for refusing to sign a pledge promising to neither belong to a union nor participate in a sympathetic strike. With the assistance of the Citizens&#x27; Committee, the city police were replaced with a large body of untrained but better paid special constables who patrolled the streets with clubs. Within hours, one of the special constables, a much-medalled World War I veteran Frederick Coppins, charged into a gathering of strikers and was dragged off his horse and severely pummelled. This led to claims that he was attacked by &quot;enemy ruffians&quot;.

The local newspapers, the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; and &quot;Winnipeg Tribune&quot;, had lost the majority of their employees due to the strike, but once they were able to resume publication, they took a decidedly anti-strike stance. The &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; called the strikers &quot;bohunks&quot;, &quot;aliens&quot;, and &quot;anarchists&quot; and ran cartoons depicting radicals throwing bombs. These anti-strike views influenced the opinions of some Winnipeg residents and contributed to the deepening atmosphere of crisis.

A plan to offer a modified form of collective bargaining to the Metal Trades Council was in the works at the middle of the month, but any efforts at compromise were ended by a series of arrests on charges of seditious conspiracy. In the early morning hours of June 17, the RNWMP apprehended several prominent leaders of the strike, including George Armstrong, Roger Bray, Abraham Heaps, William Ivens, R.B. Russell and John Queen. In addition, Bill Pritchard, a Vancouver union organizer who was returning from Winnipeg, was arrested in Calgary. R. J. Johns, of Winnipeg, was in Montreal and not arrested at this time. With the exception of Armstrong, who was Canadian-born, they were all British immigrants. Several foreign-born socialists, including Sam Blumenberg, Max Charitonoff and Solomon Almazoff were also arrested, as was Oscar Schoppelrei, an American-born Canadian war veteran of German ethnic origin.

===Bloody Saturday===
The climax of the strike came a few days later, on Saturday, June 21, which was soon known as Bloody Saturday. To protest against the arrest of the strike leaders, the returned soldiers had announced a demonstration in the form of a &quot;silent parade&quot; on Main Street for Saturday afternoon. Crowds assembled in the thousands in the streets around City Hall. When the soldiers refused to call off the demonstration, Mayor Gray requested assistance from the RNWMP, who entered into the crowds on horseback, wielding clubs in an attempt to disperse the assembly. A streetcar operated by a strikebreaker attempted to travel south on Main Street towards Portage Avenue but was stopped and tipped off the tracks and briefly set on fire.

After the Mayor read the Riot Act, the Mounties entered the fray again, this time discharging their .45 revolvers in three separate volleys. About 120 shots were fired. One man, Mike Sokolowski, was killed on the spot. Another, Steve Szczerbanowicz, died later from his wounds. Hospitals reported about 30 injuries, mainly from police gunfire. Others were tended to by friends and family. As the crowds were chased into sidestreets and broken up, some 80 people were arrested by the &quot;specials&quot; and military patrols that took over the downtown area.

When the &quot;Strike Bulletin&quot; published its account of the events of Bloody Saturday, the editors, J.S. Woodsworth and Fred J. Dixon, were arrested and charged with seditious libel. They had published articles with headings such as &quot;Kaiserism in Canada&quot; and &quot;The British Way&quot;. The charges against Woodsworth included his quotation of a verse from Isaiah: &quot;Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees.&quot; Further publication of the newspaper was suppressed.

These events broke the confidence of the Strike Committee, and on June 25, they announced the end of the strike for 11:00 a.m. the next day. After six weeks, workers drifted back to their jobs, but many were blacklisted or otherwise punished for participating in the strike.

===Role in the labour revolt===
In May and June 1919, general strikes broke out in as many as thirty other cities, from Amherst, Nova Scotia, to Victoria, British Columbia. Some of these strikes were protests against local conditions; some were in solidarity with the Winnipeg strikers; some arose from both causes.

==Aftermath==
===&quot;State trials&quot; and deportations===
Eight of the strike leaders were brought to trial on charges of seditious conspiracy. The evidence against them focused less on their actions than on their socialist ideas, which were seen as the root cause of the unrest that led to the general strike. Under arrangements accepted (and paid for) by the federal government, the prosecution was conducted by Andrews and other &quot;legal gentlemen&quot; who were active in the Citizens&#x27; Committee during the strike.

Seven of the accused (Armstrong, Bray, Ivens, Johns, Pritchard, Russell and Queen) were found guilty by the largely rural juries selected for the trials. Most were sentenced to one-year sentences, but Russell was sentenced to two years and Bray, who was convicted on a lesser charge, was sentenced to six months. (As well, John Farnell, who had filled the void left in the leadership of pro-strike returned soldiers after Bray&#x27;s arrest, was sentenced to nine months in prison. He was released three months early, due to his wife&#x27;s illness.)

Heaps conducted his own defence. He was acquitted on all charges. Dixon, who was charged with seditious libel, delivered a strong defence of the right to free speech as an essential element of the British tradition. After forty hours of deliberation, the largely urban jury acquitted him. This result caused the prosecution to abandon the similar charges against Woodsworth. 

In the case of the &quot;foreigners&quot; arrested on June 17, there were no criminal proceedings. The attempt to deport Almazoff failed, and Charitonoff appealed successfully against a deportation order. Blumenberg and Schoppelrei were deported on technical grounds related to their original entry into the country. Blumenberg found his feet in the U.S., organizing workers in the Duluth area and even running for municipal office there on the socialist platform. 

===Political impact===
A provincial royal commission headed by H.A. Robson investigated the strike. The report deplored sympathetic strikes but concluded that the Winnipeg strike was not a criminal conspiracy by foreigners and stated that &quot;if Capital does not provide enough to assure Labour a contented existence... then the Government might find it necessary to step in and let the state do these things at the expense of Capital.&quot;

The impact of the strike was evident in subsequent elections. Labour had elected some representatives prior to the strike but the number significantly increased afterwards at all three levels of government.

While awaiting trial, Queen was re-elected to the Winnipeg City council. While serving out their sentences in prison, Armstrong, Ivens and Queen were elected to the Manitoba legislature. Queen later served seven terms as mayor of Winnipeg. 

Woodsworth was elected as a Labour Member of Parliament from Winnipeg in 1921 and was repeatedly re-elected until his death in 1942. In 1932 he helped found and became leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, a forerunner of the New Democratic Party. That party was elected to provincial government in Saskatchewan in 1944 and in Manitoba in 1969. Heaps was elected as the Labour Member of Parliament for Winnipeg North in 1925 and re-elected until 1940.
===Strike&#x27;s impact on unions===
Organized labour built on the legacy of the strike to strengthen the union movement and to pursue formal collective bargaining rights. The One Big Union flourished briefly, achieving its greatest popularity in 1920. This was followed by the rise of new industrial unions in the 1930s. The renewed poverty and insecurity of the Great Depression led to a long period of labour militancy across Canada in the 1940s, when union membership increased substantially. By the end of that decade, a formal industrial relations regime was established in Canadian law that provided some security for unions and their members but also threatened to limit the scope of their activity.

==Historiography==
Discussion of the Winnipeg General Strike often begins with whether it was a conspiracy to overthrow the government or a fight for union recognition and a living wage. Given the scale of the strike and its political impact, it was difficult to consider it only an ordinary collective bargaining dispute. This led some historians to study local labour relations in detail, while others examined the nature of labour reform and radical activism in western Canada. Churches, immigrants, women, soldiers, and municipal politics have also been the subject of study. The &quot;red scare&quot; promoted by business and government spokesmen attracted attention, as did the legal manoeuvres that led to the arrest and conviction of prominent strike supporters on charges of sedition.

While some historians regarded the strike as a western labour revolt rooted in unique conditions in western Canada, others have pointed to widespread labour unrest across Canada, both in 1919 itself and also during the years from 1917 to 1925. Recent accounts of the strike have also noted that most strikers were not union members, suggesting that the events might be described as an urban rebellion against the failings of the capitalist social order as it existed at the end of World War I.

==Commemorations in popular culture==

Shortly after the strike, two novels, Ralph Connor&#x27;s &quot;To Him that Hath&quot; (Toronto, 1921) and Douglas Durkin&#x27;s &quot;The Magpie&quot; (Toronto, 1923), explored some of the labour and social themes raised by the strike. &quot;Fox&quot;, a 1991 novel by author Margaret Sweatman, is a work of historical fiction about the events leading up to and following the strike. In 2019, Fernwood Publishing released &quot;Papergirl,&quot; a young adult novel by Melinda McCracken about a girl who distributes the strikers&#x27; newspaper. In the same year, &quot;1919 A Graphic History of the Winnipeg General Strike&quot; was published by the Graphic History Collective. 

Among remembrances of this event in Canadian popular culture is the song &quot;In Winnipeg&quot; by musician Mike Ford, included in the album &quot;Canada Needs You Volume Two&quot;. In 2005, Danny Schur created a musical called &quot;Strike!&quot; based on the event. A film version called &quot;Stand!&quot; was scheduled for release in 2019 and premiered on September 10, 2019. Many of the famous photographs of the strike were by Winnipeg photographer L. B. Foote. In Winnipeg, there are several memorials and monuments commemorating the strike.

<doc id="80039" wikidata="Q317947" url="?curid=80039" title="Crates of Thebes">
<text>Crates (; c. 365 – c. 285 BC) of Thebes was a Greek Cynic philosopher, the principal pupil of Diogenes of Sinope and the husband of Hipparchia of Maroneia who lived in the same manner as him. Crates gave away his money to live a life of poverty on the streets of Athens. Respected by the people of Athens, he is remembered for being the teacher of Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism. Various fragments of Crates&#x27; teachings survive, including his description of the ideal Cynic state.

==Life==
Crates was born c. 365 BC in Thebes. He was the son of Ascondus, and was the heir to a large fortune, which he is said to have renounced to live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Diogenes Laërtius preserves several different accounts of this story; one of them has Crates giving his money away to the citizens of Thebes, apparently after seeing the beggar king Telephus in a tragedy; whereas another account has him placing his money in the hands of a banker, with the agreement that he should deliver it to his sons, unless they too became philosophers, in which case he should distribute it among the poor.

He moved to Athens where tradition says he became a pupil of Diogenes of Sinope; the precise relationship between Crates and Diogenes is uncertain, but there is one apparent reference to Crates referring to himself as &quot;a fellow-citizen of Diogenes, who defied all the plots of envy&quot;. Crates is also described as being the student of Bryson the Achaean, and of Stilpo. He lived a life of cheerful simplicity, and Plutarch, who wrote a detailed biography of Crates which does not survive, records what sort of man Crates was:

He is said to have been deformed with a lame leg and hunched shoulders. He was nicknamed the Door-Opener () because he would enter any house and people would receive him gladly and with honour:

He attracted the attentions of Hipparchia of Maroneia, the sister of one of Crates&#x27; students, Metrocles. Hipparchia is said to have fallen in love with Crates and with his life and teachings, and thus rejecting her wealthy upbringing in a manner similar to Crates, she married him. The marriage was remarkable (for ancient Athens) for being based on mutual respect and equality between the couple. Stories about Hipparchia appearing in public everywhere with Crates are mentioned precisely because respectable women did not behave in that way, and as part of Cynic shamelessness, they had sexual intercourse in public. They had at least two children, a girl, and a boy named Pasicles. We learn that Crates is supposed to have initiated his son into sex by taking him to a brothel, and he allowed his daughter a month&#x27;s trial marriage to potential suitors.

He was the teacher of Zeno of Citium in the last years of the century, and was undoubtedly the biggest influence on Zeno in his development of Stoic philosophy. Zeno always regarded Crates with the greatest respect, and some of the accounts we have of Crates have probably come down to us via Zeno&#x27;s writings. His other pupils included Metrocles, Monimus, Menippus, Cleomenes, Theombrotus, and Crates&#x27; brother Pasicles. He may also have taught Cleanthes, Zeno&#x27;s successor as head of the Stoic school.

Crates was, apparently, in Thebes in 307 BC, when Demetrius Phalereus was exiled there. He is said to have died at a great age (c. 285 BC), and was buried in Boeotia.

==Philosophy==
According to Diogenes Laërtius, Crates wrote a book of letters on philosophical subjects, the style of which Diogenes compares to that of Plato;. There are 36 surviving &quot;Cynic epistles&quot; attributed to Crates, but these are later, 1st-century, compositions.

Crates was also the author of some philosophical tragedies, and some smaller poems apparently called &quot;Games&quot; ().
Several fragments of his thought survive. He taught a simple asceticism, which seems to have been milder than that of his predecessor Diogenes:
Some of his philosophical writings were infused with humour, in the form of spoudaiogeloion. He urged people not to prefer anything but lentils in their meals, because luxury and extravagance were the chief causes of seditions and insurrections in a city. This jest would later be the cause of much satire, as in book 4 of Athenaeus&#x27; &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; where a group of Cynics sit down for a meal and are served course after course of lentil soup.

One of his poems parodied a famous hymn to the Muses written by Solon. But whereas Solon wished for prosperity, reputation, and &quot;justly acquired possessions&quot;, Crates had typically Cynic desires:

There are also several fragments surviving of a poem Crates wrote describing the ideal Cynic state which begins by parodying Homer&#x27;s description of Crete. Crates&#x27; city is called &quot;Pera&quot;, which in Greek refers to the beggar&#x27;s wallet which every Cynic carried:

The word &quot;tuphos&quot; () in the first line, is one of the first known Cynic uses of a word which literally means mist or smoke. It was used by the Cynics to describe the mental confusion which most people are wrapped-up in. The Cynics sought to clear away this fog and to see the world as it really is.

==Later cultural references==
The relationship between Crates and Hipparchia became the subject of a number of fictional accounts, such as the play , written by Italian nun Clemenza Ninci in the 17th century, or Christoph Martin Wieland&#x27;s novel &quot;Krates und Hipparchia&quot; (1804). A fictional biography of Crates was written by French author Marcel Schwob in his 1896 work .

<doc id="80045" wikidata="Q631696" url="?curid=80045" title="Tycho (lunar crater)">
<text>Tycho () is a prominent lunar impact crater located in the southern lunar highlands, named after the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601). It is estimated to be 108 million years old.

To the south of Tycho is the crater Street, to the east is Pictet, and to the north-northeast is Sasserides. The surface around Tycho is replete with craters of various sizes, many overlapping still older craters. Some of the smaller craters are secondary craters formed from larger chunks of ejecta from Tycho.
It is one of the Moon&#x27;s brightest craters, with a diameter of and a depth of .

==Age and description==
Tycho is a relatively young crater, with an estimated age of 108 million years (Ma), based on analysis of samples of the crater ray recovered during the mission. This age initially suggested that the impactor may have been a member of the Baptistina family of asteroids, but as the composition of the impactor is unknown this remained conjecture.
However, this possibility was ruled out by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer in 2011, as it was discovered that the Baptistina family was produced much later than expected, having formed approximately 80 million years ago.

The crater is sharply defined, unlike older craters that have been degraded by subsequent impacts. The interior has a high albedo that is prominent when the Sun is overhead, and the crater is surrounded by a distinctive ray system forming long spokes that reach as long as 1,500 kilometers. Sections of these rays can be observed even when Tycho is illuminated only by earthlight. Due to its prominent rays, Tycho is mapped as part of the Copernican System.
The ramparts beyond the rim have a lower albedo than the interior for a distance of over a hundred kilometers, and are free of the ray markings that lie beyond. This darker rim may have been formed from minerals excavated during the impact.

Its inner wall is slumped and terraced, sloping down to a rough but nearly flat floor exhibiting small, knobby domes. The floor displays signs of past volcanism, most likely from rock melt caused by the impact. Detailed photographs of the floor show that it is covered in a criss-crossing array of cracks and small hills. The central peaks rise above the floor, and a lesser peak stands just to the northeast of the primary massif.

Infrared observations of the lunar surface during an eclipse have demonstrated that Tycho cools at a slower rate than other parts of the surface, making the crater a &quot;hot spot&quot;. This effect is caused by the difference in materials that cover the crater.

The rim of this crater was chosen as the target of the mission. The robotic spacecraft safely touched down north of the crater in January 1968. The craft performed chemical measurements of the surface, finding a composition different from the maria. From this, one of the main components of the highlands was theorized to be anorthosite, an aluminium-rich mineral. The crater was also imaged in great detail by 

From the 1950s through the 1990s, NASA aerodynamicist Dean Chapman and others advanced the lunar origin theory of tektites. Chapman used complex orbital computer models and extensive wind tunnel tests to support the theory that the so-called Australasian tektites originated from the Rosse ejecta ray of Tycho. Until the Rosse ray is sampled, a lunar origin for these tektites cannot be ruled out, though tektites are now generally considered to have been produced by terrestrial impact events.

This crater was drawn on lunar maps as early as 1645, when A.M.S. de Rheita depicted the bright ray system.

== Names ==
Tycho is named after the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was given its name by the Jesuit astronomer G.B. Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names. Pierre Gassendi named it Umbilicus Lunaris (&#x27;the navel of the Moon&#x27;). van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Vladislai IV&quot; after Władysław IV Vasa, King of Poland. And Johannes Hevelius named it &#x27;Mons Sinai&#x27; after Mount Sinai.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Tycho.

== Fictional references ==
* There is a chapter entitled &quot;Tycho&quot; in Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Around the Moon&quot; (&quot;Autour de la Lune&quot;, 1870) which describes the crater and its ray system.

* In R.A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1940 short story &quot;Blowups Happen&quot;, a character speculates that Tycho may have been the location of a sentient race&#x27;s main atomic power plant, in a past time when the Moon was still habitable—and that the plant exploded, causing the craters, the rays spreading from Tycho, and the death of all life on the Moon.

* C.D. Simak set his 1961 novelette &quot;The Trouble with Tycho&quot;, at the lunar crater. He also postulated that the crater&#x27;s rays were composed of volcanic glass (tektites) akin to a theory postulated by NASA researchers Dean Chapman and John O&#x27;Keefe in the 1970s.

* In Heinlein&#x27;s 1966 book &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, Tycho is the location of the lunar habitat named &quot;Tycho Under&quot;.

* Tycho was the location of the Tycho Magnetic Anomaly (TMA-1), and subsequent excavation of an alien monolith, in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, the seminal 1968 science-fiction film by Stanley Kubrick and book by Arthur C. Clarke.

* In the 1987 film &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, Cindy notices Tycho while looking through a telescope on her final &quot;contractual&quot; date with Ronny in the Airplane Graveyard.

* It also serves as the location of &quot;Tycho City&quot; in the 1996 film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;; a lunar metropolis by the 24th century.

* In Jack Williamson&#x27;s 2001 novel &quot;Terraforming Earth&quot;, the crater is utilized for &quot;Tycho Base&quot;, a self-sustaining, robot-controlled installation aimed at restoring life to the (dead) planet Earth after an asteroid sterilizes the biosphere.

* In the 2019 film &quot;Ad Astra&quot;, the Moon base is situated in the Tycho crater. This is Roy&#x27;s first stop on his journey to Mars.

* Crater Tycho figures prominently in the Matthew Looney and Maria Looney series of children&#x27;s books set on the Moon, authored by Jerome Beatty.

* In R.M. Allen&#x27;s &quot;Hunted Earth&quot; novels, the &#x27;naked purples&#x27; own a former penal colony in or around Tycho crater known as &quot;Tycho Purple Penal&quot; (see &quot;The Ring of Charon&quot;).

* Tycho is referenced in the band Cojum Dip&#x27;s song, Waltz in E Major, Op. 15 &quot;Moon Waltz&quot;.

* Tycho is referenced in the 2022 game &quot;Horizon Forbidden West&quot; as the site of a Helium-3 mine.

<text>Surveyor 7 was sent to the Moon in 1968 on a scientific and photographic mission as the seventh and last lunar lander of the American uncrewed Surveyor program. With two previous unsuccessful missions in the Surveyor series, and with Surveyor 7&#x27;s landing success, Surveyor 7 became the fifth and final spacecraft in the series to achieve a lunar soft landing. A total of 21,091 pictures were transmitted from Surveyor 7 back to Earth.

The objectives for this mission were to perform a lunar soft landing (in an area well removed from the maria to provide a type of terrain photography and lunar sample significantly different from those of other Surveyor missions); obtain postlanding TV pictures; determine the relative abundances of chemical elements; manipulate the lunar material; obtain touchdown dynamics data; and obtain thermal and radar reflectivity data.

This spacecraft was similar in design to the previous Surveyors, but it carried more scientific equipment including a television camera with polarizing filters, a surface sampler, bar magnets on two footpads, two horseshoe magnets on the surface scoop, and auxiliary mirrors. Of the auxiliary mirrors, three were used to observe areas below the spacecraft, one to provide stereoscopic views of the surface sampler area, and seven to show lunar material deposited on the spacecraft. The spacecraft landed on the lunar surface on January 10, 1968, on the outer rim of the crater Tycho.

Operations of the spacecraft began shortly after the soft landing and were terminated on January 26, 1968, 80 hours after sunset. On January 20, while the craft was still in daylight, the TV camera clearly saw two laser beams aimed at it from the night side of the crescent Earth, one from Kitt Peak National Observatory, Tucson, Arizona, and the other at Table Mountain at Wrightwood, California.

Operations on the second lunar day occurred from February 12 to 21, 1968. The mission objectives were fully satisfied by the spacecraft operations. Battery damage was suffered during the first lunar night and transmission contact was subsequently sporadic. Contact with Surveyor 7 was lost on February 21, 1968.

NASA and Bellcom mission planners considered the Surveyor 7 site as a potential target for a crewed late Apollo mission, perhaps Apollo 20, though a combination of operational constraints, including the high latitude of the site and its rough terrain, and the early cancellation of post-Apollo 17 lunar missions, contributed to the site&#x27;s elimination.

Surveyor 7 was the first probe to detect the faint glow on the lunar horizon after dark that is now thought to be light reflected from electrostatically levitated Moon dust, a phenomenon known as Lunar horizon glow

==Science instruments==

===Television===

The TV camera consisted of a vidicon tube, 25 and 100 mm focal length lenses, shutters, polarizing filters, and iris mounted nearly vertically and surmounted by a mirror that could be adjusted by stepping motors to move in both azimuth and elevations. The polarizing filters served as analyzers for the detection of measurements of the linearly polarized component of light scattered from the lunar surface. The frame by frame coverage of the lunar surface provided a 360 deg azimuth view and an elevation view from approximately +90 deg above the plane normal to the camera A axis to -60 deg below this same plane.

Both 600 line and 200 line modes of operation were used. The 200 line mode transmitted over an omnidirectional antenna and scanned one frame each 61.8 seconds. A complete video transmission of each 200 line picture required 20 seconds and utilized a bandwidth of 1.2 kHz. Most transmissions consisted of 600 line pictures, which were telemetered by a directional antenna. The frames were scanned each 3.6 seconds. Each frame required nominally one second to be read from the vidicon and utilized a 220 kHz bandwidth for transmission. The dynamic range and sensitivity of this camera were slightly less than those on the Surveyor 6 camera. Resolution and quality were excellent. The television images were displayed on a slow scan monitor coated with a long persistency phosphor. The persistency was selected to optimally match the nominal maximum frame rate. One frame of TV identification was received for each incoming TV frame and was displayed in real time at a rate compatible with that of the incoming image. These data were recorded on a video magnetic tape recorder and on 70 mm film.

Surveyor 7 camera characteristics on 600-line mode were:

* Dynamic range: 11.1:1
* Signal-to-noise ratio (dB): 43.6
* Horizontal relative response at 600 lines (at center of vidicon): 0.20
* Vertical relative response at 600 lines (at center of vidicon): 0.33
* Slope of system transfer characteristic curve: 0.98

The camera transmitted 20,961 pictures during the first lunar day, January 10 to January 22, 1968. From February 12 to February 14, the camera was operated in the 200 line mode because of loss of horizontal sweep in the 600 line mode. During the second lunar day, 45 pictures were transmitted before loss of power caused suspension of camera operation.

On 20 January 1968, it successfully detected two argon lasers from Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and Table Mountain Observatory in Wrightwood, California. This was one of the early tests of laser communication in space.
===Alpha-Scattering Surface Analyzer ===
The alpha-scattering surface analyzer was designed to measure directly the abundances of the major elements of the lunar surface. The instrumentation consisted of an alpha source (curium 242) collimated to irradiate a 10 mm diameter opening in the bottom of the instrument where the sample was located and two parallel but independent charged particle detector systems. One system, containing two sensors, detected the energy spectra of the alpha particles scattered from the lunar surface, and the other, containing four sensors, detected energy spectra of the protons produced via reaction (alpha and proton) in the surface material. Each detector assembly was connected to a pulse height analyzer. A digital electronics package, located in a compartment on the spacecraft, continuously telemetered signals to earth whenever the experiment was operating. The spectra contained quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium, and lithium. The experiment provided 46 hours of data accumulated from three lunar surface sample measurements. These measurements were of a portion of undisturbed local lunar surface, a lunar rock, and an extensively trenched area of the lunar surface. Data were obtained during the first and second lunar days, January 12 to 23, 1968, and February 13 to 21, 1968.

The alpha backscattering instrument failed to deploy properly. Mission controllers successfully used the surface soil sampler claw to push the alpha backscattering instrument into the proper position to conduct its experiments.

===Soil Mechanics Surface Sampler===
The soil mechanics surface sampler was designed to pick up, dig, scrape, and trench the lunar surface, and transport lunar surface material while being photographed so that the properties of the lunar surface could be determined. The sampler consisted primarily of a scoop with a container, a sharpened blade, and an electric motor to open and close the container. The flat foot of the scoop incorporated two embedded rectangular horseshoe magnets. The scoop was mounted on a pantograph arm that could be extended about 1.5 m or retracted close to the spacecraft motor drive. The arm could also be moved from an azimuth of +40° to -72° or be elevated 130 mm by motor drives. It could also be dropped onto the lunar surface under force provided by gravity and a spring. The scoop was mounted below the television camera in a position that allowed it to reach the alpha-scattering instrument in its deployed position and redeploy it to another selected location. The instrument performed 16 bearing tests, seven trenching tests, and two impact tests. It also freed the alpha-scattering instrument when it failed to deploy on the lunar surface, shaded this instrument, and moved this instrument for evaluation of other samples. Performance was flawless during 36 hours of operation between January 11 and January 23, 1968. The instrument responded to commands on February 14, 1968, which verified that it had survived the lunar night. The power system, however, was unable to support any operations.

<doc id="80047" wikidata="Q59138" url="?curid=80047" title="Diogenes Laertius">
<text>Diogenes Laërtius ( ; , ; ) was a biographer of the Greek philosophers. Little is definitively known about his life, but his surviving book &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot; is a principal source for the history of ancient Greek philosophy. His reputation is controversial among scholars because he often repeats information from his sources without critically evaluating it. In many cases, he focuses on insignificant details of his subjects&#x27; lives while ignoring important details of their philosophical teachings and he sometimes fails to distinguish between earlier and later teachings of specific philosophical schools. However, unlike many other ancient secondary sources, Diogenes Laërtius tends to report philosophical teachings without trying to reinterpret or expand on them, and so his accounts are often closer to the primary sources. Due to the loss of so many of the primary sources on which Diogenes relied, his work has become the foremost surviving source on the history of Greek philosophy.

==Life==
Laërtius must have lived after Sextus Empiricus (c. 200), whom he mentions, and before Stephanus of Byzantium and Sopater of Apamea (c. 500), who quote him. His work makes no mention of Neoplatonism, even though it is addressed to a woman who was &quot;an enthusiastic Platonist&quot;. Hence he is assumed to have flourished in the first half of the 3rd century, during the reign of Alexander Severus (222–235) and his successors.

The precise form of his name is uncertain. The ancient manuscripts invariably refer to a &quot;Laertius Diogenes&quot;, and this form of the name is repeated by Sopater and the Suda. The modern form &quot;Diogenes Laertius&quot; is much rarer, used by Stephanus of Byzantium, and in a lemma to the Greek Anthology. He is also referred to as &quot;Laertes&quot; or simply &quot;Diogenes&quot;.

The origin of the name &quot;Laertius&quot; is also uncertain. Stephanus of Byzantium refers to him as &quot;Διογένης ὁ Λαερτιεύς&quot; (&quot;Diogenes ho Laertieus&quot;), implying that he was the native of some town, perhaps the Laerte in Caria (or another Laerte in Cilicia). Another suggestion is that one of his ancestors had for a patron a member of the Roman family of the Laërtii. The prevailing modern theory is that &quot;Laertius&quot; is a nickname (derived from the Homeric epithet &quot;Diogenes Laertiade&quot;, used in addressing Odysseus) used to distinguish him from the many other people called Diogenes in the ancient world.

His home town is unknown (at best uncertain, even according to a hypothesis that &quot;Laertius&quot; refers to his origin). A disputed passage in his writings has been used to suggest that it was Nicaea in Bithynia.

It has been suggested that Diogenes was an Epicurean or a Pyrrhonist. He passionately defends Epicurus in Book 10, which is of high quality and contains three long letters attributed to Epicurus explaining Epicurean doctrines. He is impartial to all schools, in the manner of the Pyrrhonists, and he carries the succession of Pyrrhonism further than that of the other schools. At one point, he even seems to refer to the Pyrrhonists as &quot;our school.&quot; On the other hand, most of these points can be explained by the way he uncritically copies from his sources. It is by no means certain that he adhered to any school, and he is usually more attentive to biographical details.

In addition to the &quot;Lives,&quot; Diogenes refers to another work that he had written in verse on famous men, in various metres, which he called &quot;Epigrammata&quot; or &quot;Pammetros&quot; (Πάμμετρος).

==&quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;==

The work by which he is known, &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot; (; ), was written in Greek and professes to give an account of the lives and opinions of the Greek philosophers.

Although it is at best an uncritical and unphilosophical compilation, its value, as giving us an insight into the private lives of the Greek sages, led Montaigne to write that he wished that instead of one Laërtius there had been a dozen. On the other hand, modern scholars have advised that we treat Diogenes&#x27; testimonia with care, especially when he fails to cite his sources: &quot;Diogenes has acquired an importance out of all proportion to his merits because the loss of many primary sources and of the earlier secondary compilations has accidentally left him the chief continuous source for the history of Greek philosophy&quot;.

===Organization of the work===
Diogenes divides his subjects into two &quot;schools&quot; which he describes as the Ionian/Ionic and the Italian/Italic; the division is somewhat dubious and appears to be drawn from the lost doxography of Sotion. The biographies of the &quot;Ionian school&quot; begin with Anaximander and end with Clitomachus, Theophrastus and Chrysippus; the &quot;Italian&quot; begins with Pythagoras and ends with Epicurus. The Socratic school, with its various branches, is classed with the Ionic; while the Eleatics and Pyrrhonists are treated under the Italic. He also includes his own poetic verse, albeit pedestrian, about the philosophers he discusses.
The work contains incidental remarks on many other philosophers, and there are useful accounts concerning Hegesias, Anniceris, and Theodorus (Cyrenaics); Persaeus (Stoic); and Metrodorus and Hermarchus (Epicureans). Book VII is incomplete and breaks off during the life of Chrysippus. From a table of contents in one of the manuscripts (manuscript P), this book is known to have continued with Zeno of Tarsus, Diogenes, Apollodorus, Boethus, Mnesarchus, Mnasagoras, Nestor, Basilides, Dardanus, Antipater, Heraclides, Sosigenes, Panaetius, Hecato, Posidonius, Athenodorus, another Athenodorus, Antipater, Arius, and Cornutus. The whole of Book X is devoted to Epicurus, and contains three long letters written by Epicurus, which explain Epicurean doctrines.

His chief authorities were Favorinus and Diocles of Magnesia, but his work also draws (either directly or indirectly) on books by Antisthenes of Rhodes, Alexander Polyhistor, and Demetrius of Magnesia, as well as works by Hippobotus, Aristippus, Panaetius, Apollodorus of Athens, Sosicrates, Satyrus, Sotion, Neanthes, Hermippus, Antigonus, Heraclides, Hieronymus, and Pamphila.

===Oldest extant manuscripts===
There are many extant manuscripts of the &quot;Lives&quot;, although none of them are especially old, and they all descend from a common ancestor, because they all lack the end of Book VII. The three most useful manuscripts are known as B, P, and F. Manuscript B (&quot;Codex Borbonicus&quot;) dates from the 12th century, and is in the National Library of Naples. Manuscript P (&quot;Paris&quot;) is dated to the 11th/12th century, and is in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Manuscript F (&quot;Florence&quot;) is dated to the 13th century, and is in the Laurentian Library. The titles for the individual biographies used in modern editions are absent from these earliest manuscripts, however they can be found inserted into the blank spaces and margins of manuscript P by a later hand.

There seem to have been some early Latin translations, but they no longer survive. A 10th-century work entitled &quot;Tractatus de dictis philosophorum&quot; shows some knowledge of Diogenes. Henry Aristippus, in the 12th century, is known to have translated at least some of the work into Latin, and in the 14th century an unknown author made use of a Latin translation for his &quot;De vita et moribus philosophorum&quot; (attributed erroneously to Walter Burley).

===Printed editions===

The first printed editions were Latin translations. The first, &quot;Laertii Diogenis Vitae et sententiae eorum qui in philosophia probati fuerunt&quot; (Romae: Giorgo Lauer, 1472), printed the translation of Ambrogio Traversari (whose manuscript presentation copy to Cosimo de&#x27; Medici was dated February 8, 1433) and was edited by Elio Francesco Marchese. The Greek text of the lives of Aristotle and Theophrastus appeared in the third volume of the Aldine Aristotle in 1497. The first edition of the whole Greek text was that published by Hieronymus Froben in 1533. The Greek/Latin edition of 1692 by Marcus Meibomius divided each of the ten books into paragraphs of equal length, and progressively numbered them, providing the system still in use today.

The first critical edition of the entire text, by H.S. Long in the Oxford Classical Texts, was not produced until 1964; this edition was superseded by Miroslav Marcovich&#x27;s Teubner edition, published between 1999 and 2002. A new edition, by Tiziano Dorandi, was published by Cambridge University Press in 2013.

===English translations===
Thomas Stanley&#x27;s 1656 &quot;History of Philosophy&quot; adapts the format and content of Laertius&#x27;s work into English, but Stanley compiled his book from a number of classical biographies of philosophers. The first complete English translation was a late 17th-century translation by ten different persons. A better translation was made by Charles Duke Yonge (1853), but although this was more literal, it still contained many inaccuracies. The next translation was by Robert Drew Hicks (1925) for the Loeb Classical Library, although it is slightly bowdlerized. A new translation by Pamela Mensch was published by Oxford University Press in 2018. Another by Stephen White was published by Cambridge University Press in 2020.

==Legacy and assessment==
Henricus Aristippus, the archdeacon of Catania, produced a Latin translation of Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s book in southern Italy in the late 1150s, which has since been lost or destroyed. Geremia da Montagnone used this translation as a source for his &quot;Compedium moralium notabilium&quot; () and an anonymous Italian author used it as a source for work entitled &quot;Liber de vita et moribus philosophorum&quot; (written 1317–1320), which reached international popularity in the Late Middle Ages. The monk Ambrogio Traversari (1386–1439) produced another Latin translation in Florence between 1424 and 1433, for which far better records have survived. The Italian Renaissance scholar, painter, philosopher, and architect Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) borrowed from Traversari&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot; in Book 2 of his &quot;Libri della famiglia&quot; and modeled his own autobiography on Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s &quot;Life of Thales&quot;.

Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s work has had a complicated reception in modern times. The value of his &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot; as an insight into the private lives of the Greek sages led the French Renaissance philosopher Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) to exclaim that he wished that, instead of one Laërtius, there had been a dozen. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) criticized Diogenes Laërtius for his lack of philosophical talent and categorized his work as nothing more than a compilation of previous writers&#x27; opinions. Nonetheless, he admitted that Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s compilation was an important one given the information that it contained. Hermann Usener (1834–1905) deplored Diogenes Laërtius as a &quot;complete ass&quot; (&quot;asinus germanus&quot;) in his &quot;Epicurea&quot; (1887). Werner Jaeger (1888–1961) damned him as &quot;that great ignoramus&quot;. In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, however, scholars have managed to partially redeem Diogenes Laertius&#x27;s reputation as a writer by reading his book in a Hellenistic literary context.

Nonetheless, modern scholars treat Diogenes&#x27;s testimonia with caution, especially when he fails to cite his sources. Herbert S. Long warns: &quot;Diogenes has acquired an importance out of all proportion to his merits because the loss of many primary sources and of the earlier secondary compilations has accidentally left him the chief continuous source for the history of Greek philosophy.&quot; Robert M. Strozier offers a somewhat more positive assessment of Diogenes Laertius&#x27;s reliability, noting that many other ancient writers attempt to reinterpret and expand on the philosophical teachings they describe, something which Diogenes Laërtius rarely does. Strozier concludes, &quot;Diogenes Laertius is, when he does not conflate hundreds of years of distinctions, reliable simply because he is a less competent thinker than those on whom he writes, is less liable to re-formulate statements and arguments, and especially in the case of Epicurus, less liable to interfere with the texts he quotes. He does, however, simplify.&quot;

Despite his importance to the history of western philosophy and the controversy surrounding him, according to Gian Mario Cao, Diogenes Laërtius has still not received adequate philological attention. Both modern critical editions of his book, by H. S. Long (1964) and by M. Marcovich (1999) have received extensive criticism from scholars.

He is criticized primarily for being overly concerned with superficial details of the philosophers&#x27; lives and lacking the intellectual capacity to explore their actual philosophical works with any penetration. However, according to statements of the 14th-century monk Walter Burley in his &quot;De vita et moribus philosophorum&quot;, the text of Diogenes seems to have been much fuller than that which we now possess.

=== Reliability ===
Although Diogenes had a will to objectivity and fact-checking, Diogenes&#x27;s works are today seen as generally unreliable from a historical perspective. He is neither consistent nor reliable in some of his reports and some of the details he cites contain obvious errors. Some of them were probably introduced by copyists in the transmission of the text from antiquity, but some errors are undoubtedly due to Diogenes himself. The reliability of Diogenes&#x27; sources have also been questioned, since he uses comic poets as sources. Professor Brian Gregor suggests that readers will benefit from modern scholarly assistance while reading Diogenes&#x27; biographies, since they are &quot;notoriously unreliable&quot;. Some scholars (e.g. Delfim Leão) state that Diogenes&#x27; unreliability is not entirely his responsibility and blame his sources instead.

<text>Surveyor 3 is the third lander of the American uncrewed Surveyor program sent to explore the surface of the Moon in 1967 and the second to successfully land. It was the first mission to carry a surface-soil sampling-scoop.

Surveyor 3 was visited by Apollo 12 astronauts Pete Conrad and Alan Bean in November 1969, and remains the only probe visited by humans on another world. The Apollo 12 astronauts excised several components of Surveyor 3, including the television camera, and returned them to Earth for study.

==History==
Launched on April 17, 1967, Surveyor 3 landed on April 20, 1967, at the Mare Cognitum portion of the Oceanus Procellarum (S3° 01&#x27; 41.43&quot; W23° 27&#x27; 29.55&quot;), in a small crater that was subsequently named Surveyor. It transmitted 6,315 TV images to the Earth, including the first images to show what planet Earth looked like from the Moon&#x27;s surface.

As Surveyor 3 was landing in the crater highly reflective rocks confused the spacecraft&#x27;s lunar descent radar. The engines failed to cut off at in altitude as called for in the mission plans, and this delay caused the lander to bounce on the lunar surface twice. Its first bounce reached the altitude of about . The second bounce reached a height of about . On the third impact with the surface – from the initial altitude of , and velocity of zero, which was below the planned altitude of , and very slowly descending – Surveyor 3 settled down to a soft landing as intended.

This Surveyor mission was the first that carried a surface-soil sampling-scoop, which can be seen on its extendable arm in the pictures. This mechanism was mounted on an electric-motor-driven arm and was used to dig four trenches in the lunar soil. These trenches were up to deep. Samples of soil from the trenches were placed in front of the Surveyor&#x27;s television cameras to be photographed and the pictures radioed back to the Earth. When the first lunar nightfall came on May 3, 1967, Surveyor 3 was shut down because its solar panels were no longer producing electricity. At the next lunar dawn (after 14 terrestrial days, or about 336 hours), Surveyor 3 could not be reactivated, because of the extremely cold temperatures that it had experienced. This is in contrast with the Surveyor 1, which was able to be reactivated twice after lunar nights, but then never again.
Surveyor 3 became famous after the crew of Apollo 12 used it as a landing target site. Landing within walking distance on November 19, 1969, the astronauts took several pictures of the probe and removed a scoop from the probe&#x27;s soil mechanics-surface sampler, a section of unpainted aluminum tube from a strut supporting the Surveyor&#x27;s radar altimeter and Doppler velocity sensor, another section of aluminum tube that was coated with inorganic white paint and a segment of television cable wrapped in aluminized plastic film and the Surveyor 3&#x27;s television camera which were returned to Earth. Surveyor 3 is the only probe visited by humans on another world.

==Science instruments==

===Television===
The television camera on Surveyor 3 consisted of a vidicon tube, two 25 and 100 millimeter focal length lenses, shutters, clear, red, green and blue optical filters, and an iris mounted along an axis inclined about 16 degrees to the central axis of the spacecraft. The TV camera was mounted under a mirror that could be moved in azimuth (horizontally) and elevation (vertically). The operation of the camera was completely dependent upon the receipt of proper commands from the Earth. Frame-by-frame coverage of the lunar surface was obtained over the complete 360 degrees in azimuth, and from +40 degrees above the plane normal to the camera&#x27;s Z-axis to −65 degrees below this plane. Both 600-line and 200-line modes of TV camera operation were used. The 200-line mode transmitted over an omnidirectional antenna and scanned one frame every 61.8 seconds. A complete video transmission of each 200-line picture required 20 seconds and used a bandwidth of 1.2 kHz. The 600-line pictures were transmitted over a directional antenna. These pictures were scanned as often as once every 3.6 seconds. Each 600-line picture required a nominal one second to be read from the image vidicon, and its transmission required a 220 kHz bandwidth, using digital picture transmission. The TV photos were displayed back on the Earth on a slow-scan TV monitor that was coated with a long-persistence phosphor. Its persistence had been selected to match the nominal maximum frame rate. One frame of TV identification was received for each incoming TV photo, and the picture was displayed in real-time at a rate compatible with that of the incoming image. These data were recorded on a video magnetic-tape recorder. The camera returned 6315 pictures between April 20 and May 3, 1967, including views of the spacecraft itself, panoramic lunar surveys, views of the mechanical surface digger at work, and of an April 24 eclipse of the Sun by the Earth.

The Apollo 12 Lunar Module landed near Surveyor 3 on November 19, 1969. Astronauts Conrad and Bean examined the spacecraft, and they brought back about of parts of the Surveyor to the Earth, including its TV camera, which is now on permanent display in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

Analysis of the camera found that it withstood 947 days in the vacuum of space, including 32 two-week lunar nights with temperatures dropping below , in good condition. Most major components were functional and undamaged. Some changes were caused by temperature extremes, micrometeorite strikes, and manufacturing errors. The recovered sampler scoop was also in good condition with little change other than some sun-induced fading of the paint.

===Soil mechanics surface sampler===
The soil mechanics surface sampler was designed to dig, scrape, and trench the lunar surface and to transport lunar surface material while being photographed so that the properties of the lunar surface could be determined. The sampler was mounted below the television camera and consisted primarily of a scoop approximately long and wide. The scoop consisted of a container, a sharpened blade, and an electric motor to open and close the container. A small footpad was attached to the scoop door to present a flat surface to the lunar surface. The scoop was capable of holding a maximum quantity of approximately diameter of solid lunar material and a maximum of of granular material. The scoop was mounted on a pantograph arm that could be extended about or retracted close to the spacecraft motor drive. The arm could also be moved from an azimuth of +40 to -72 degrees or be elevated by motor drives. It could also be dropped onto the lunar surface under force provided by gravity and a spring. The surface sampler performed seven bearing tests, four trench tests, and thirteen impact tests. The total operating time was 18 hours, 22 minutes on ten separate occasions. Measurements of motor currents and forces applied to the surface were not obtained due to the state of the spacecraft telemetry following landing on the lunar surface. However, estimations were possible. The small spring constant of the torque spring precluded the determination of density from the impact tests. Penetrations of were obtained from the bearing tests, and a depth was reached during trenching operations. The design of the mechanism and its electronic auxiliary was more than adequate for the lunar surface operations. The scoop was also returned to Earth by the Apollo 12 astronauts and is currently on display at JPL.

==Apollo 12 and the possibility of interplanetary contamination==

The Surveyor 3 landing site was later selected also as the landing target for the Lunar Module of the Apollo 12 crewed lunar mission in 1969. Several components of the Surveyor 3 lander were collected and returned to the Earth for study of the long-term exposure effects of the harsh lunar environment on human-made objects and materials. Although space probes have returned to Earth in the decades since Apollo 12, this remains the only occasion on which humans have visited a probe that had been sent off-world.

It is widely claimed that a common type of bacterium, &quot;Streptococcus mitis&quot;, accidentally contaminated the Surveyor&#x27;s camera prior to launch, and that the bacteria survived dormant in the harsh lunar environment for two and a half years, supposedly then to be detected when Apollo 12 brought the Surveyor&#x27;s camera back to the Earth. This claim has been cited by some as providing credence to the idea of interplanetary panspermia, but more importantly, it led NASA to adopt strict abiotic procedures for space probes to prevent contamination of the planet Mars and other astronomical bodies that are suspected of having conditions possibly suitable for life. Most dramatically, the &quot;Galileo&quot; space probe was deliberately destroyed at the end of its mission by crashing it into Jupiter, to avoid the possibility of contaminating the Jovian moon Europa with bacteria from Earth. The &quot;Cassini&quot; probe also impacted Saturn at the end of its mission in 2017.

However, independent investigators have challenged the claim of surviving bacteria on Surveyor 3 on the Moon. There is a possibility the contamination was caused by using a non-airtight container, or when the samples were being taken in the clean room after Apollo 12.

==Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter==
In 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) photographed the Surveyor 3 landing site in some detail, in which surrounding astronaut foot tracks could also be seen. In 2011, the LRO returned to the landing site at a lower altitude to take higher resolution photographs.

<text>Marshal Lon Nol (, also ; 13 November 1913 – 17 November 1985) was a Cambodian military officer and politician who served as Prime Minister of Cambodia twice (1966–67; 1969–71), as well as serving repeatedly as defence minister and provincial governor. As a nationalist and conservative, he led the military coup of 1970 against Prince Norodom Sihanouk, abolished the monarchy, and established the short-lived Khmer Republic. Constitutionally a semi-presidential republic, Cambodia was &quot;de facto&quot; governed under a military dictatorship. He was the commander-in-chief of the Khmer National Armed Forces during the Cambodian Civil War and became President of the Khmer Republic on 10 March 1972. On 1 April 1975, 16 days before the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh, Lon Nol fled to the United States, first to Hawaii and then to California, where he remained until his death in 1985.

==Early life==
Nol was born in Prey Veng Province on 13 November 1913, to a family of mixed Khmer-Chinese descent. His father Lon Hin was the son of a Khmer Krom from Tay Ninh Province who later served as a district chief in Siem Reap and Kampong Thom, after making a name for himself &#x27;pacifying&#x27; bandit groups in Prey Veng. His maternal grandfather was a Chinese immigrant from Fujian who later became the governor of Prey Veng. Nol was educated in the relatively privileged surroundings of the Lycée Chasseloup-Laubat in Saigon, followed by the Cambodian Royal Military Academy.

==Employment in the colonial government==
Nol found employment with the French colonial civil service in 1937. He became a magistrate, and soon proved himself as an efficient enforcer of French rule against a series of anti-colonial disturbances in 1939. By 1946, he had risen to the post of Governor of Kratie Province. He became an associate of King Norodom Sihanouk, and by the late 1940s, when he set up a right-wing, monarchist, pro-independence political group, was becoming increasingly involved in the developing Cambodian political scene. Joining the army in 1952, he carried out military operations against the Viet Minh.

After independence, Nol&#x27;s nationalist Khmer Renovation party (along with small right-wing parties headed by Sam Sary and Dap Chhuon) became the core of the Sangkum, the organisation set up by Sihanouk to participate in the 1955 elections. Sangkum won the elections and Sihanouk became prime minister.

==In the administration of Sihanouk, 1955–70==
Nol was appointed the Army Chief of Staff in 1955, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces in 1960, as well as serving as Defence Minister. At the time, he was a trusted supporter of Sihanouk, his police being instrumental in the suppression of the small, clandestine communist movement in Cambodia. He was appointed deputy Premier in 1963. While Sihanouk, in an attempt to distance his country from the effects of the Vietnam War, was pursuing a foreign policy of &quot;extreme neutrality&quot;, which involved association with China and toleration of North Vietnamese activity on the eastern borders, Nol remained friendly towards the United States, and indicated that he regretted the ending of US aid after 1963.

The 1966 parliamentary elections represented a major shift in the balance of power towards Lon Nol and the rightist elements of the Sangkum, as conservative and right-wing candidates were overwhelmingly elected. Lon Nol became prime minister, and the following year troops carried out a savage repression of a leftist-inspired revolt, the Samlaut Uprising, in Battambang Province.

Nol was injured in a car crash later in 1967, and temporarily retired from politics. In 1968, however, he returned as Minister of Defence and in 1969 became prime minister a second time, appointing the vocally anti-Sihanouk, and pro-US politician Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak as his deputy.

==The 1970 coup==

Sihanouk later claimed that the 1970 coup against him was the result of an alliance between his longstanding enemy, exiled politician Son Ngoc Thanh and Sirik Matak, with CIA support and planning. Although there are indications that Lon Nol approached the US during 1969 to gauge the likelihood of military support for a coup against Sihanouk, there is no concrete evidence of CIA involvement, though it remains possible some military intelligence agents may have had partial responsibility. It seems likely that in setting in motion the events leading up to the coup, Lon Nol initially intended to strengthen his position against the North Vietnamese with the ultimate aim of preventing their troops (and those of the Viet Cong) from operating within Cambodian borders, and wished to apply pressure on Sihanouk to achieve this. However, events rapidly developed far beyond the original plan, and with the encouragement of Sirik Matak – who wished to see Sihanouk deposed as Head of State – Lon Nol was ultimately to engineer Sihanouk&#x27;s removal.

While Sihanouk was abroad during March 1970, there were anti-Vietnamese riots in Phnom Penh. On 12 March, Lon Nol and Sirik Matak closed the port of Sihanoukville, through which weapons were being smuggled to the Viet Cong, to the North Vietnamese and issued an ultimatum: all North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within 72 hours or face military action.

Lon Nol initially refused to countenance Sihanouk being deposed as Head of State; to force his hand, Sirik Matak played him a tape-recorded press conference from Paris, in which Sihanouk blamed them for the unrest and threatened to execute them both on his return to Phnom Penh. However, the Prime Minister remained uncertain as to whether to instigate a vote in the National Assembly. On the night of 17 March, Sirik Matak, accompanied by three army officers, went to the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence and compelled a weeping Lon Nol to sign the necessary documents at gunpoint.

A vote was taken in the National Assembly on 18 March in which Sihanouk was stripped of his power. General Lon Nol assumed the powers of the Head of State on an emergency basis. On 28 and 29 March there were large-scale popular demonstrations in favour of Sihanouk in several provincial cities, but Lon Nol&#x27;s forces suppressed them, causing several hundred deaths. The Khmer Republic was formally declared that October, and Sihanouk – who had formed a government-in-exile, the GRUNK, incorporating the Khmer Rouge communists – was condemned to death &quot;in absentia&quot;. In the meantime during the Cambodian Campaign of April 1970, US and South Vietnamese forces entered Cambodian territory in pursuit of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops.

==The Khmer Republic and the Civil War==

The Khmer Republic (1970–1975) abandoned Sihanouk&#x27;s neutrality policies, especially with regard to the Vietnamese. Ultimately, the republic proved disastrous both militarily and politically. Lon Nol&#x27;s health started to decline after he suffered a stroke in February 1971. His rule became increasingly erratic and authoritarian: he appointed himself Marshal (a title previously unknown in Cambodia) in April 1971, and in October suspended the National Assembly, stating he would no longer &quot;vainly play the game of democracy and freedom&quot; in wartime. Backed by his forceful, ambitious younger brother General Lon Non, Nol succeeded in reducing the influence of Sirik Matak, In Tam and the other coup leaders. He also insisted on directing many of the Khmer National Armed Forces () operations personally.

In time Lon Nol&#x27;s regime became completely dependent upon large quantities of American aid that towards the end were not backed by the political and military resolve needed to effectively help the beleaguered republic. By 1975, the government was eventually reduced to holding little more than Phnom Penh and the Preah Vihear Temple in the northern border with Thailand. The FANK was quickly running out of ammunition. Lon Nol was increasingly dependent on the advice of soothsayers and Buddhist mystics: at one point during a Khmer Rouge assault on Phnom Penh, he sprinkled a circular line of consecrated sand in order to defend the city. Finally, on 1 April, he resigned and fled the country into exile, as his name was the first on a list of people the Khmer Rouge had vowed to execute.

==Exile and death==
The first priority of the Khmer Rouge after conquering Cambodia and overthrowing the Khmer Republic was to immediately execute all the deposed leaders and high officials. Lon Nol was able to escape, first to Indonesia and then to the United States. He spent time in Hawaii before settling in Fullerton, California, in 1979. He lived with his second wife Sovanna Lon (1943-2013) and several of his nine children until his heart condition-related death on 17 November 1985 at St. Jude Medical Center. He was buried at Loma Vista Memorial Park in Fullerton.

==Political views==
Despite his actions in deposing Sihanouk, Nol was a firm believer in traditional Cambodian hierarchy: after Sihanouk had been removed he prostrated himself at the Queen Mother&#x27;s feet to ask forgiveness. He termed his ideology, a blend of nationalism and mysticism, &quot;Neo-Khmerism&quot;. He expressed an ambition of reuniting the ethnic Khmers of Cambodia with the Khmer Krom of the Mekong Delta and the Khmer Surin of Thailand, projecting a state of &quot;thirty million&quot; Khmers by the year 2020. Asking his followers to embrace the traditions of what he referred to as Mon-Khmer &quot;holy warriors&quot; (&quot;yuthesel&quot;), he also encouraged them to refer to him as their &quot;Black Papa&quot;, a name referring to the dark skin considered to be the sign of an &quot;authentic&quot; Khmer. In late life, Nol referred to himself as a &quot;black Khmer&quot; and sought to deny the fact that he had partial Chinese ancestry.

==Family==
His younger brother, Lon Nil was killed by pro-Sihanouk workers during Cambodian coup of 1970. Another younger brother, Lon Non worked as Minister of Interior and Ambassador-at-large for the Khmer Republic, and was executed by Khmer Rouge after the Fall of Phnom Penh. His grandnephew is French kickboxer Antoine Pinto, grandson of his brother Lon Non. 

His son, Lon Rith, established the Khmer Republican Party in 2006.

<text>Norodom Sihanouk (; 31 October 192215 October 2012) was a member of the Cambodian royal house who led the country as King and Prime Minister. In Cambodia, he is known as Samdech Euv (meaning &quot;King Father&quot;). During his lifetime, Cambodia was under various regimes, from French colonial rule (until 1953), a Japanese puppet state (1945), an independent kingdom (1953–1970), a military republic (1970–1975), the Khmer Rouge regime (1975–1979), a Vietnamese-backed communist regime (1979–1989), a transitional communist regime (1989–1993) to eventually another kingdom (since 1993).

Sihanouk was the only child of Prince Norodom Suramarit and Princess Sisowath Kossamak, daughter of King Sisowath Monivong. When his grandfather Monivong died in 1941, Sihanouk became king amidst French colonial rule. After the Japanese occupation of Cambodia during World War II, he secured Cambodian independence from France in 1953. He abdicated in 1955 and was succeeded by his father, Suramarit, so as to directly participate in politics. Sihanouk&#x27;s political organization Sangkum won the general elections that year, and he became prime minister of Cambodia. He governed the country under one-party rule and suppressed political dissent. After his father died in 1960, Sihanouk assumed a new position as Chief of State of Cambodia.

Officially neutral in foreign relations, Sihanouk was closer to the communist bloc in practice. The 1970 Cambodian coup d&#x27;état ousted him, and he fled to China and North Korea, forming a government-in-exile and a resistance movement there. He encouraged Cambodians to fight the new government and backed the Khmer Rouge during the Cambodian Civil War. He returned as figurehead head of state after the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s victory in 1975. His relations with the new government soured, and in 1976 he resigned. He was placed under house arrest until Vietnamese forces overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979.

Sihanouk went into exile again and in 1981 formed FUNCINPEC, a resistance party. The following year, he became president of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), a broad coalition of anti-Vietnamese resistance factions which retained Cambodia&#x27;s seat at the United Nations, making him Cambodia&#x27;s internationally recognized head of state. In the late 1980s, informal talks were carried out to end hostilities between the Vietnam-supported People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea and the CGDK. In 1990, the Supreme National Council of Cambodia was formed as a transitional body to oversee Cambodia&#x27;s sovereign matters, with Sihanouk as its president. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords were signed, and the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was established the following year. The UNTAC organized the general elections in 1993, and a coalition government, jointly led by his son Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, was subsequently formed. Sihanouk was reinstated as Cambodia&#x27;s king. He abdicated again in 2004, and the Royal Council of the Throne chose his son Sihamoni as his successor. Sihanouk died in Beijing in 2012.

Between 1941 and 2006, Sihanouk produced and directed 50 films, some of which he acted in. The films, later described as being of low quality, often featured nationalistic elements, as did a number of the songs he wrote. Some of his songs were about his wife Monique, the nations neighboring Cambodia, and the communist leaders who supported him in his exile. In the 1980s, Sihanouk held concerts for diplomats in New York City. He also participated in concerts at his palace during his second reign. Sihanouk is remembered for his role in shaping modern Cambodia, particularly in leading the country to independence, although his reputation was damaged by his association with the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.

==Early life and first reign==
Norodom Sihanouk was the only child born of the union between Norodom Suramarit and Sisowath Kossamak. His parents, who heeded the Royal Court Astrologer&#x27;s advice that he risked dying at a young age if he was raised under parental care, placed him under the care of Kossamak&#x27;s grandmother, Pat. When Pat died, Kossamak brought Sihanouk to live with his paternal grandfather, Norodom Sutharot. Sutharot delegated parenting responsibilities to his daughter, Norodom Ket Kanyamom.

Sihanouk received his primary education at the François Baudoin school and Nuon Moniram school in Phnom Penh. During this time, he received financial support from his maternal grandfather, Sisowath Monivong, to head an amateur performance troupe and soccer team. In 1936, Sihanouk was sent to Saigon, where he pursued his secondary education at Lycée Chasseloup Laubat, a boarding school.

When the reigning king Monivong died on 23 April 1941 the Governor-General of French Indochina, Jean Decoux, chose Sihanouk to succeed him. Sihanouk&#x27;s appointment as king was formalised the following day by the Cambodian Crown Council, and his coronation ceremony took place on 3 May 1941. During the Japanese occupation of Cambodia, he dedicated most of his time to sports, filming, and the occasional tour to the countryside. In March 1945 the Japanese military, which had occupied Cambodia since August 1941, dissolved the nominal French colonial administration. Under pressure from the Japanese, Sihanouk proclaimed Cambodia&#x27;s independence and assumed the position of prime minister while serving as king at the same time.

===Pre-independence and self-rule===
As prime minister, Sihanouk revoked a decree issued by the last resident superior of Cambodia, Georges Gautier, to romanise the Khmer alphabet. Following the Surrender of Japan in August 1945, nationalist forces loyal to Son Ngoc Thanh launched a coup, which led to Thanh becoming prime minister. When the French returned to Cambodia in October 1945, Thanh was dismissed and replaced by Sihanouk&#x27;s uncle Sisowath Monireth. Monireth negotiated for greater autonomy in managing Cambodia&#x27;s internal affairs. A modus vivendi signed in January 1946 granted Cambodia autonomy within the French Union.

A joint French-Cambodian commission was set up after that to draft Cambodia&#x27;s constitution, and in April 1946 Sihanouk introduced clauses which provided for an elected parliament on the basis of universal male suffrage as well as press freedom. The first constitution was signed into effect by Sihanouk in May 1947. Around this time, Sihanouk made two trips to Saumur, France, where he attended military training at the Armoured Cavalry Branch Training School in 1946, and again in 1948. He was made a reserve captain in the French army.

In early 1949, Sihanouk traveled to Paris with his parents to negotiate with the French government for more autonomy for Cambodia. The modus vivendi was replaced by a new Franco-Khmer treaty, which recognised Cambodia as &quot;independent&quot; within the French Union. In practice, the treaty granted only limited self-rule to Cambodia. While Cambodia was given free rein in managing its foreign ministry and, to a lesser extent, its defence, most of the other ministries remained under French control.

Meanwhile, dissenting legislators from the national assembly attacked the government led by prime minister Penn Nouth over its failure to resolve deepening financial and corruption problems plaguing the country. The dissenting legislators, led by Yem Sambaur, who had defected from the Democratic Party in November 1948, deposed Penn Nouth. Yem Sambaur replaced him, but his appointment did not sit well with the Democrats, who in turn pressured Sihanouk to dissolve the national assembly and hold elections.

Sihanouk, who by now had tired of the political squabbling, dissolved the assembly in September 1949, but opted to rule by decree for the next two years before general elections were held, which the Democrats won. In October 1951, Thanh returned to Cambodia and was received by 100,000 supporters, a spectacle which Sihanouk saw as an affront to his regal authority. Thanh disappeared six months later, presumably to join the Khmer Issarak. Sihanouk ordered the Democrat-led government to arrest Thanh but was ignored.

Subsequently, civil demonstrations against the monarchy and the French broke out in the countryside, alarming Sihanouk, who began to suspect that the Democrats were complicit. In June 1952 Sihanouk dismissed the Democrat nominee Huy Kanthoul and made himself prime minister. A few days later, Sihanouk privately confided in exasperation to the US chargé d&#x27;affaires, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Cambodia.

In January 1953, Sihanouk re-appointed Penn Nouth as prime minister before leaving for France. Once there, Sihanouk wrote to French President Vincent Auriol requesting that he grant Cambodia full independence, citing widespread anti-French sentiment among the Cambodian populace. Auriol deferred Sihanouk&#x27;s request to the Minister of the Overseas, Jean Letourneau, who promptly rejected it. Subsequently, Sihanouk traveled to Canada and the United States, where he gave radio interviews to present his case.

He took advantage of the prevailing anti-communist sentiment in those countries, arguing that Cambodia faced a Communist threat similar to that of the Viet Minh in Vietnam, and that the solution was to grant full independence to Cambodia. Sihanouk returned to Cambodia in June 1953, taking up residence in Siem Reap. He organised public rallies calling for Cambodians to fight for independence, and formed a citizenry militia which attracted about 130,000 recruits.

In August 1953, France agreed to cede control over judicial and interior affairs to Cambodia, and in October 1953 the defense ministry as well. At the end of October, Sihanouk went to Phnom Penh, where he declared Cambodia&#x27;s independence from France on 9 November 1953. In May 1954, Sihanouk sent two of his cabinet ministers, Nhiek Tioulong and Tep Phan, to represent Cambodia at the Geneva Conference. The agreements affirmed Cambodia&#x27;s independence and allowed it to seek military aid from any country without restrictions.

At the same time, Sihanouk&#x27;s relations with the governing Democrat party remained strained, as they were wary of his growing political influence. To counter Democrat opposition, Sihanouk held a national referendum to gauge public approval for his efforts to seek national independence. While the results showed 99.8percent approval, Australian historian Milton Osborne noted that open balloting was carried out and voters were cowed into casting an approval vote under police surveillance.

==Sangkum era==
===Abdication and entry into politics===
On 2 March 1955, Sihanouk suddenly abdicated the throne and was in turn succeeded by his father, Norodom Suramarit. His abdication surprised everyone, including his own parents. In his abdication speech, Sihanouk explained that he was abdicating in order to extricate himself from the &quot;intrigues&quot; of palace life and allow easier access to common folk as an &quot;ordinary citizen&quot;. According to Osborne, Sihanouk&#x27;s abdication earned him the freedom to pursue politics while continuing to enjoy the deference that he had received from his subjects when he was king. He also feared being cast aside by the government after discovering that his popularity was manufactured by his own officials.

In April 1955, before leaving for a summit with Asian and African states in Bandung, Indonesia, Sihanouk announced the formation of his own political party, the Popular Socialist Community (Sangkum), and expressed interest in participating in the general elections slated to be held in September 1955. While the Sangkum was, in effect, a political party, Sihanouk argued that the Sangkum should be seen as a political &quot;organisation&quot;, and explained that he could accommodate people with differing political orientations on the sole condition that they pledged fealty to the monarchy. The creation of the Sangkum was seen as a move to dissolve the political parties.

Sangkum was based on four small, monarchist, rightist parties, including the &#x27;Victorious North-East&#x27; party of Dap Chhuon, the Khmer Renovation Party party of Lon Nol, the People&#x27;s Party and the Liberal Party. At the same time, Sihanouk was running out of patience with the increasingly leftist Democratic Party and the left-wing Pracheachon, as both had refused to merge into his party and had campaigned against him. He appointed as director of national security Dap Chhuon, who ordered the national police to jail their leaders and break up their election rallies. When elections were held, the Sangkum received 83 percent of all valid votes. They took up all seats in the National Assembly, replacing the Democrats, which had until then been the majority party. The following month, Sihanouk was appointed as prime minister.

===Premiership (1955–1960)===

Once in office, Sihanouk introduced several constitutional changes, including extending suffrage to women, adopting Khmer as the sole official language of the country and making Cambodia a constitutional monarchy by vesting policy-making powers in the prime minister rather than the king. He viewed socialism as an ideal concept for establishing social equality and fostering national cohesion within newly independent Cambodia. In March 1956, he embarked on a national programme of &quot;Buddhist socialism&quot;, promoting socialist principles on the one hand while maintaining the kingdom&#x27;s Buddhist culture on the other.

Between 1955 and 1960, Sihanouk resigned and retook the post of prime minister several times, citing fatigue caused by overwork. The National Assembly nominated experienced politicians such as Sim Var and San Yun to become prime minister whenever Sihanouk took leave, but they similarly relinquished their posts each time, several months into their term, as cabinet ministers repeatedly disagreed over public policy matters.

In May 1955, Sihanouk had accepted military aid from the US. The following January, when he was in the Philippines on a state visit, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operatives attempted to sway him into placing Cambodia under Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) protection. US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles went to great efforts to convince Sihanouk, however he refused because &quot;I considered SEATO an aggressive military alliance directed against neighbors whose ideology I did not share but with whom Cambodia had no quarrel&quot;. Subsequently, Sihanouk began to suspect that the US was attempting to undermine his government and that it was lending covert support to the Democratic party, now without parliamentary representation, for that purpose. Sihanouk developed a good impression of China, whose premier, Zhou Enlai, gave him a warm reception on his first visit there in February 1956. They signed a friendship treaty in which China promised in economic aid to Cambodia.

When Sihanouk returned from China, Sarit Thanarat and Ngo Dinh Diem, leaders of Thailand and South Vietnam, respectively, both with pro-American sympathies, started to accuse him of pro-Communist sympathies. South Vietnam briefly imposed a trade embargo on Cambodia, preventing trading ships from travelling up the Mekong river to Phnom Penh. While Sihanouk professed that he was pursuing a policy of neutrality, Sarit and Diem remained distrustful of him, more so after he established formal diplomatic relations with China in 1958.

The Democratic party continued to criticize the Sangkum and Sihanouk in their newspaper, much to Sihanouk&#x27;s consternation. In August 1957, Sihanouk finally lost patience, calling out Democrat leaders for a debate. Five of them attended. At the debate, held at the Royal Palace, Sihanouk spoke in a belligerent tone, challenging the Democrat leaders to present evidence of malfeasance in his government and inviting them to join the Sangkum. The Democrat leaders gave hesitant responses, and, according to American historian David P. Chandler, this gave the audience the impression that they were disloyal to the monarchy.

The debate led to the effective demise of the Democratic party, as its leaders were subsequently beaten up by government soldiers, with Sihanouk&#x27;s tacit approval. With the Democrats vanquished, Sihanouk focused on preparing for general elections, slated to be held in March 1958. He drafted left-wing politicians, including Hou Yuon, Hu Nim and Chau Seng, to stand as Sangkum candidates, with a view to winning left-wing support from the Pracheachon. The Pracheachon on their part fielded five candidates for the elections. However, four of them withdrew, as they were prevented by the national police from holding any election rallies. When voting took place, the Sangkum won all seats in the national assembly.

In December 1958 Ngo Dinh Nhu, Diem&#x27;s younger brother and chief adviser, broached the idea of orchestrating a coup to overthrow Sihanouk. Nhu contacted Dap Chhuon, Sihanouk&#x27;s Interior Minister, who was known for his pro-American sympathies, to prepare for the coup against his boss. Chhuon received covert financial and military assistance from Thailand, South Vietnam, and the CIA. In January 1959 Sihanouk learned of the coup plans through intermediaries who were in contact with Chhuon. The following month, Sihanouk sent the army to capture Chhuon, who was summarily executed as soon as he was captured, effectively ending the coup attempt. Sihanouk then accused South Vietnam and the United States of orchestrating the coup attempt.

Six months later, on 31 August 1959, a small packaged lacquer gift fitted with a parcel bomb was delivered to the royal palace. Norodom Vakrivan, the chief of protocol, was killed instantly when he opened the package. Sihanouk&#x27;s parents, Suramarit and Kossamak, were sitting in another room not far from Vakrivan. An investigation traced the origin of the parcel bomb to an American military base in Saigon. While Sihanouk publicly accused Ngo Dinh Nhu of masterminding the bomb attack, he secretly suspected that the US was also involved. The incident deepened his distrust of the US.

===Initial years as Head of State (1960–1965)===
Suramarit, Sihanouk&#x27;s father, died on 3 April 1960 after several months of poor health that Sihanouk blamed upon the shock that his father had received from the parcel bomb attack. The following day, the Cambodian Crown Council met to choose Monireth as regent. Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the new post of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers equivalent to that of the king. A referendum held on 5 June 1960 approved Sihanouk&#x27;s proposals, and Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of State on 14 June 1960. As the head of state, Sihanouk took over various ceremonial responsibilities of the king, such as holding public audiences and leading the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. At the same time, he continued to play an active role in politics as Sangkum&#x27;s leader.
In 1961, Pracheachon&#x27;s spokesperson, Non Suon, criticized Sihanouk for failing to tackle inflation, unemployment, and corruption in the country. Non Suon&#x27;s criticisms gave Sihanouk the impetus to arrest Pracheachon leaders, and, according to him, he had discovered plans by their party to monitor local political developments on behalf of foreign powers. That same year Sihanouk attended the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, making Cambodia one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement. In May 1962 Tou Samouth, Pracheachon&#x27;s secretary-general, disappeared, and its ideological ally, the Communist Party of Kampuchea, suspected that Samouth had been secretly captured and killed by police. Sihanouk nevertheless allowed Sangkum&#x27;s left-wing politicians to run again in the 1962 general elections, which they all won. He even appointed two left-wing politicians, Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan, as secretaries for planning and commerce, respectively, after the election.

In November 1962, Sihanouk called on the US to stop supporting the Khmer Serei, which he believed they had been secretly doing through the CIA. He threatened to reject all economic aid from the US if they failed to respond to his demands, a threat he later carried out on 19 November 1963. At the same time, Sihanouk also nationalised the country&#x27;s entrepot trade, banking sector, and distillery industries. To oversee policy and regulatory matters on the country&#x27;s entrepot trade, he set up the National Export-Import Corporation and Statutory Board, better known as &quot;SONEXIM&quot;.

When Sarit, Diem, and US president John F. Kennedy died in November and December 1963, Sihanouk rejoiced over their deaths, as he accused them of attempting to destabilise Cambodia. He organised concerts and granted civil servants extra leave time to celebrate the occasion. When the US government protested Sihanouk&#x27;s celebrations, he responded by recalling the Cambodian ambassador to the US, Nong Kimny.

In early 1964, Sihanouk signed a secret agreement with North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, allowing Chinese military aid meant for them to be delivered through Sihanoukville&#x27;s port. In turn, the Cambodian army would be paid for delivering food supplies to the Viet Cong, and at the same time skim off 10percent of all military hardware supplies. In addition, he also allowed the Viet Cong to build a trail through eastern Cambodia, so that their troops could receive war supplies from North Vietnam. The trail later became known as the Sihanouk Trail. When the US learned of Viet Cong presence in eastern Cambodia, they started a bombing campaign, spurring Sihanouk to sever diplomatic ties with the US in May 1965. As a result of this secret agreement, Communist countries, including China, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, provided military aid to Cambodia.

===Continued leadership as Head of State (1966–1970)===

In September 1966, general elections were held, and Sangkum legislators with conservative and right-wing sympathies dominated the national assembly. In turn, they nominated Lon Nol, a military general who shared their political sympathies, as prime minister. However, their choice did not sit well with Sihanouk. To counterbalance conservative and right-wing influence, in October 1966 Sihanouk set up a shadow government made up of Sangkum legislators with left-wing sympathies. At the end of the month, Lon Nol offered to resign from his position, but was stopped from doing so by Sihanouk.

In April 1967, the Samlaut Uprising occurred, with local peasants fighting against government troops in Samlaut, Battambang. As soon as government troops managed to quell the fighting, Sihanouk began to suspect that three left-wing Sangkum legislatorsKhieu Samphan, Hou Yuon and Hu Nimhad incited the rebellion. When Sihanouk threatened to charge Khieu Samphan and Hou Yuon before a military tribunal, they fled into the jungle to join the Khmer Rouge, leaving Hu Nim behind.

Lon Nol resigned as prime minister in early May 1967, and Sihanouk appointed Son Sann in his place. At the same time, Sihanouk replaced conservative-leaning ministers appointed by Lon Nol with technocrats and left-leaning politicians. In the later part of the month, after receiving news that the Chinese embassy in Cambodia had published and distributed Communist propaganda to the Cambodian populace praising the Cultural Revolution, Sihanouk accused China of supporting local Chinese Cambodians in engaging in &quot;contraband&quot; and &quot;subversive&quot; activities.

In August 1967, Sihanouk sent to China his Foreign Minister, Norodom Phurissara, who unsuccessfully urged Zhou to stop the Chinese embassy from disseminating Communist propaganda. In response, Sihanouk closed the CambodiaChinese Friendship Association in September 1967. When the Chinese government protested, Sihanouk threatened to close the Chinese embassy in Cambodia. Zhou stepped in to placate Sihanouk, and compromised by instructing its embassy to send its publications to Cambodia&#x27;s information ministry for vetting prior to distribution.

As relations with China worsened, Sihanouk pursued rapprochement with the US. He learned that Kennedy&#x27;s widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, had expressed a desire to see Angkor Wat. Seeing this as an opportunity to restore relations with the US, Sihanouk invited her to visit Cambodia and personally hosted her visit in October 1967. Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s visit paved the way for Sihanouk to meet with Chester Bowles, the US ambassador to India. To Bowles, Sihanouk expressed his willingness to restore bilateral relations with the US, hinted at the presence of Viet Cong troops in Cambodia, and suggested he would turn a blind eye should US forces enter Cambodia to attack Viet Cong troops retreating into Cambodia from South Vietnam—a practice known as &quot;hot pursuit&quot;—provided that Cambodians were unharmed.

Silhanouk told Bowles that he disliked the Vietnamese as a people, saying he had no love for any Vietnamese, red, blue, North or South&quot;. Kenton Clymer notes that this statement &quot;cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids&quot; the US launched in eastern Cambodia beginning in March 1969 as part of Operation Menu, adding: &quot;In any event, no one asked him. ... Sihanouk was never asked to approve the B-52 bombings, and he never gave his approval.&quot; The bombing forced the Viet Cong to flee from their jungle sanctuaries and seek refuge in populated towns and villages.

As a result, Sihanouk became concerned that Cambodia might get drawn into fighting in the Vietnam War. In June 1969, he extended diplomatic recognition to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRGSV), hoping that he could get the Viet Cong troops under its charge to leave Cambodia should they win the war. At the same time, he also openly admitted the presence of Viet Cong troops in Cambodia for the first time, prompting the US to restore formal diplomatic relations with Cambodia three months later.

As the Cambodian economy was stagnating due to systemic corruption, Sihanouk opened two casinosin Phnom Penh and Sihanoukvillein January 1969. While the casinos satisfied his aim of generating state revenues of up to 700 million riels in that year, it also caused a sharp increase in the number of bankruptcies and suicides. In August 1969 Lon Nol was reappointed as Prime Minister, with Sisowath Sirik Matak as his deputy. Two months later, Lon Nol left Cambodia to seek medical treatment, leaving Sirik Matak to run the government. Between October and December 1969, Sirik Matak instituted several policy changes that ran contrary to Sihanouk&#x27;s wishes, such as allowing private banks to re-open in the country and devaluing the riel. He also encouraged ambassadors to write to Lon Nol directly, instead of going through Sihanouk, angering the latter. In early January 1970, Sihanouk left Cambodia for medical treatment in France. Shortly after he left, Sirik Matak took the opportunity to close down the casinos.

==Deposition, GRUNK and Khmer Rouge years==
===1970 coup===
In January 1970, Sihanouk left Cambodia for a two-month holiday in France, spending his time at a luxury resort in the French Riviera. On 11 March 1970, a large protest took place outside the North Vietnamese and Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam embassies, as protesters demanded Viet Cong troops withdraw from Cambodia. The protests turned chaotic, as protesters looted both embassies and set them on fire, alarming Sihanouk. Sihanouk, who was in Paris at the time, considered both returning to quell the protests and visiting Moscow, Beijing, and Hanoi. He opted for the latter, thinking that he could persuade its leaders to recall Viet Cong troops to their jungle sanctuaries, where they had originally established themselves between 1964 and 1969.

Five days later, Oum Mannorine, the half-brother of Sihanouk&#x27;s wife Monique, was summoned to the National Assembly to answer corruption charges. On that night after the hearing, Mannorine ordered troops under his command to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, but ended up getting arrested by Lon Nol&#x27;s troops instead. On 18 March 1970 the National Assembly voted to depose Sihanouk, allowing Lon Nol to assume emergency powers.
On that day, Sihanouk was in Moscow meeting Soviet prime minister Alexei Kosygin, who broke the news as he was being driven to the Moscow airport. From Moscow, Sihanouk flew to Beijing, where he was received by Zhou Enlai. Zhou arranged for the North Vietnamese Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong to fly to Beijing from Hanoi and meet with Sihanouk. Zhou greeted Sihanouk very warmly, telling him that China still recognized him as the legitimate leader of Cambodia and would be pressuring North Korea, along with several Middle Eastern and African nations, not to recognize Lon Nol&#x27;s government, saying that once China issued its declaration of support, &quot;the Soviet Union will be embarrassed and will have to reconsider&quot;. Both Zhou and Dong encouraged Sihanouk to rebel against Lon Nol and promised him military and financial support.

===Uneasy alliance===
On 23 March 1970, Sihanouk announced the formation of his resistance movement, the National United Front of Kampuchea (FUNK). He encouraged the Cambodian populace to join him and fight against Lon Nol&#x27;s government. Sihanouk was revered by the Khmer peasantry as a god-like figure, and his endorsement of the Khmer Rouge had immediate effects. The royal family was so revered that Lon Nol after the coup went to the royal palace, knelt at the feet of the queen mother and begged her forgiveness for deposing her son.

Khmer Rouge soldiers broadcast Sihanouk&#x27;s message in the Cambodian countryside, which roused demonstrations rooting for his cause that were brutally suppressed by Lon Nol&#x27;s troops. Sometime later, on 5 May 1970, Sihanouk announced the formation of a government-in-exile known as the Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea (GRUNK), leading Communist countries including China, North Vietnam, and North Korea to break relations with the Lon Nol regime. In Phnom Penh, a military trial convened on 2 July 1970, whereby Sihanouk was charged with treason and corruption in his capacity as Head of State. After a three-day trial, the judges ruled Sihanouk guilty of both charges and sentenced to him death in absentia on 5 July 1970.

Between 1970 and 1975, Sihanouk took up residence in state guesthouses at Beijing and Pyongyang, courtesy of the Chinese and North Korean governments, respectively. In February 1973, Sihanouk traveled to Hanoi, where he started on a long journey with Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge leaders. The convoy proceeded along the Ho Chi Minh trail and reached the Cambodian border at Stung Treng province the following month. From there, they traveled across the provinces of Stung Treng, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap. Throughout this entire leg of the journey, Sihanouk faced constant bombardment from American planes participating in Operation Freedom Deal. At Siem Reap, Sihanouk visited the temples of Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei, and Bayon. In August 1973, Sisowath Sirik Matak wrote an open letter calling on Sihanouk to bring the Cambodian Civil War to an end and suggesting the possibility of his return to the country. When the letter reached Sihanouk, he angrily rejected Sirik Matak&#x27;s entreaties.

After the Khmer Republic fell to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, a new regime under its charge, Democratic Kampuchea, was formed. Sihanouk was appointed as its Head of State, a ceremonial position. In September 1975, Sihanouk briefly returned to Cambodia to inter the ashes of his mother, before going abroad again to lobby for diplomatic recognition of Democratic Kampuchea. He returned on 31 December 1975 and presided over a meeting to endorse the constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. In February 1976, Khieu Samphan took him on a tour across the Cambodian countryside. Sihanouk was shocked to see the use of forced labour and population displacement carried out by the Khmer Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently accepted it in mid-April 1976, retroactively backdating it to 2 April 1976.

===House arrest===
From this point onwards, Sihanouk was kept under house arrest at the royal palace. In September 1978, he was removed to another apartment in Phnom Penh&#x27;s suburbs, where he lived until the end of the year. Throughout his confinement, Sihanouk made several unsuccessful requests to the Angkar to travel overseas. Vietnam invaded Cambodia on 22 December 1978. On 1 January 1979, Sihanouk was taken from Phnom Penh to Sisophon, where he stayed for three days until 5 January, when he was taken back to Phnom Penh. Sihanouk was taken to meet Pol Pot, who briefed him on the Angkar&#x27;s plans to repulse Vietnamese troops.

On 6 January 1979, Sihanouk was allowed to fly to Beijing from Phnom Penh, where he was greeted by Zhou Enlai&#x27;s successor, Deng Xiaoping. The next day Phnom Penh fell to advancing Vietnamese troops on 7 January 1979. On 9 January 1979, Sihanouk flew from Beijing to New York to attend the UN Security Council, where he simultaneously condemned the Khmer Rouge for orchestrating the Cambodian genocide as well as the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. Sihanouk subsequently sought asylum in China after making two unsuccessful asylum applications with the US and France.

==FUNCINPEC and CGDK years==
===Resistance movement===

After the Khmer Rouge regime was overthrown, a new Cambodian government supported by Vietnam, the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, was unhappy with Vietnam&#x27;s influence over the PRK government. Deng proposed to Sihanouk that he co-operate with the Khmer Rouge to overthrow the PRK government, but Sihanouk refused, as he opposed the genocidal policies pursued by the Khmer Rouge while they were in power. In March 1981, Sihanouk established the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC) which was complemented by a small resistance army known as (ANS).

He appointed In Tam, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in the Khmer Republic, as the commander-in-chief of ANS. The ANS needed military aid from China, and Deng seized the opportunity to sway Sihanouk into collaborating with the Khmer Rouge. Sihanouk reluctantly agreed, and started talks in March 1981 with the Khmer Rouge and the Son Sann-led Khmer People&#x27;s National Liberation Front (KPNLF) on a unified anti-PRK resistance movement.

===Negotiations and progression===
After several rounds of negotiations mediated by Deng and Singapore&#x27;s prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, FUNCINPEC, KPNLF, and the Khmer Rouge agreed to form the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) in June 1982. The CGDK was headed by Sihanouk, and functioned as a government-in-exile. The UN defeated a resolution to expel Democratic Kampuchea and admit the PRK, effectively confirming Sihanouk as Cambodia&#x27;s internationally recognized head of state.

As CGDK chairperson, Sihanouk unsuccessfully negotiated, over the next five years, with the Chinese government to broker a political settlement to end the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. During this period, Sihanouk appointed two of his sons, Norodom Chakrapong and Norodom Ranariddh, to lead the ANS. Chakrapong was appointed as the deputy chief-of-staff for the ANS in March 1985, while Ranariddh was minted to the twin positions of commander-in-chief and the chief-of-staff of the ANS in January 1986, replacing Tam.

In December 1987, the Prime Minister of the PRK government, Hun Sen, first met with Sihanouk to discuss ending the protracted Cambodian–Vietnamese War. The following July, the then-foreign minister of Indonesia, Ali Alatas, brokered the first round of meetings between the four warring Cambodian factions consisting of FUNCINPEC, Khmer Rouge, KPNLF, and the PRK government over the future of Cambodia. Two more rounds of meetings were held in February and May 1989; since all were held near Jakarta, they became known as the Jakarta Informal Meetings (JIM).

In July 1989, Ali Alatas joined French foreign minister Roland Dumas in opening the Paris Peace Conference, where discussions took place regarding plans for Vietnamese troop withdrawal and power-sharing arrangements in a hypothetical future Cambodian government. The following month, Sihanouk resigned as president of FUNCINPEC but remained in the party as an ordinary member. In September 1990, the United Nations (UN) sponsored the establishment of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia (SNC), an administrative body responsible for overseeing the sovereign affairs of Cambodia for an interim period until UN-sponsored elections were held. The creation of the SNC was subsequently ratified with United Nations Security Council Resolution 668. In July 1991 Sihanouk left FUNCINPEC altogether and was elected as the chairperson of the SNC.

==UNTAC administration era==
===Paris peace accords and return to Cambodia===
On 23 October 1991, Sihanouk led the FUNCINPEC, Khmer Rouge, KPNLF, and PRK into signing the Paris Peace Accords. The accords recognised the SNC as a &quot;legitimate representative of Cambodian sovereignty&quot; and created the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to serve as a transitional government between 1992 and 1993. In turn, UNTAC was given the mandate to station peacekeeping troops in Cambodia to supervise the disarmament of troops from the four warring Cambodian factions and to carry out national elections by 1993. Sihanouk subsequently returned to Phnom Penh on 14 November 1991. Together with Hun Sen, Sihanouk rode in an open top limousine from Pochentong Airport all the way to the royal palace, greeting city residents who lined the streets to welcome his return.

The UNTAC administration was set up in February 1992, but stumbled in its peacekeeping operations as the Khmer Rouge refused to cooperate in disarmament. In response, Sihanouk urged UNTAC to abandon the Khmer Rouge from the peacekeeping process on two occasions, in July and September 1992. During this period, Sihanouk mostly resided in Siem Reap and occasionally traveled by helicopter to supervise election preparations in KPNLF, FUNCINPEC, and Khmer Rouge resistance bases.

Sihanouk left in November 1992 to seek medical treatment in Beijing, where he stayed for the next six months until his return to Cambodia in May 1993, on the eve of elections. While in Beijing, Sihanouk proposed a Presidential system government for Cambodia to then-UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali, but soon dropped the idea after facing opposition from the Khmer Rouge.

===1993 elections and pre-monarchical restoration===
When general elections were held, FUNCINPEC, now headed by Sihanouk&#x27;s son Norodom Ranariddh, won, while the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party (CPP) headed by Hun Sen came in second. The CPP was unhappy with the election results, and on 3 June 1993, Hun Sen and Chea Sim called on Sihanouk to lead the government. Sihanouk complied, and announced the formation of a Provisional National Government (PRG) headed by him, with Hun Sen and Ranariddh as his deputies. Ranariddh was surprised at Sihanouk&#x27;s announcement, as he had not been informed of his father&#x27;s plans, and joined Australia, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States in opposing the plan. The following day, Sihanouk rescinded his announcement through a national radio broadcast.

On 14 June 1993, Sihanouk was reinstated as the head of state in a Constituent Assembly session presided over by Ranariddh, who took the opportunity to declare the 1970 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; which overthrew Sihanouk as &quot;illegal&quot;. As Head of State, Sihanouk renamed the Cambodian military to its pre-1970 namesake, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. He also issued orders to officially rename the country from the State of Cambodia to simply &quot;Cambodia&quot;, reinstating &quot;Nokor Reach&quot; as the National Anthem of Cambodia with some minor modifications to its lyrics, and the Cambodian flag to its pre-1970 design.

At the same time, Sihanouk appointed Ranariddh and Hun Sen co-prime ministers, with equal powers. This arrangement, which was provisional, was ratified by the Constituent Assembly on 2 July 1993. On 30 August 1993, Ranariddh and Hun Sen met with Sihanouk and presented two draft constitutions, one of them stipulating a constitutional monarchy headed by a king, and another a republic led by a head of state. Sihanouk opted for the draft stipulating Cambodia a constitutional monarchy, which was ratified by the constituent assembly on 21 September 1993.

==Second reign==
===Monarchical restoration and political influence===
The new constitution came into force on 24 September 1993, and Sihanouk was reinstated as the King of Cambodia. A permanent coalition government was formed between FUNCINPEC, CPP and a third political party, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP). In turn, Sihanouk made Ranariddh and Hun Sen First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively. Shortly after that, Sihanouk left for Beijing, where he spent several months for cancer treatment. In April 1994, Sihanouk returned and the following month called the government to hold new elections so that the Khmer Rouge could be co-opted into the government.

Both Ranariddh and Hun Sen rejected his suggestion, but Sihanouk pressed on, and further proposed a national unity government consisting of FUNCINPEC, CPP, and the Khmer Rouge headed by him. Again, both prime ministers rejected Sihanouk&#x27;s proposal, arguing that Khmer Rouge&#x27;s past intransigent attitude made the proposal unrealistic. Sihanouk backed down, and expressed frustration that Hun Sen and Ranariddh had been ignoring him. As both Norodom Sirivudh and Julio Jeldres, his younger half-brother and official biographer, respectively, saw it, this was a clear sign that the monarchy&#x27;s ability to exert control over national affairs had diminished, at least vis-a-vis the prime ministers.

In July 1994, one of his sons, Norodom Chakrapong, led a failed coup attempt to topple the government. Following the coup attempt, Chakrapong took refuge in a hotel in Phnom Penh, but government troops soon discovered his hideout and surrounded the hotel. Chakrapong called Sihanouk, who negotiated with government representatives to allow him to go into exile in Malaysia. The following November, Sirivudh was accused of plotting to assassinate Hun Sen and imprisoned. Sihanouk intervened to have Sirivudh detained at the interior ministry&#x27;s headquarters, convinced that there was a secret plan to kill the latter if he were to remain in prison. After Sirivudh was relocated to the safer location, Sihanouk appealed to Hun Sen that Sirivudh be allowed to go into exile in France together with his family. Subsequently, Hun Sen accepted his offer.

Relations between the two co-prime ministers, Ranariddh and Hun Sen, deteriorated from March 1996, when the former accused the CPP of repeatedly delaying the allocation process of low-level government posts to FUNCINPECs. Ranariddh threatened to pull out of the coalition government and hold national elections in the same year if his demands were not met, stoking unease among Hun Sen and other CPP officials. The following month, Sihanouk presided over a meeting between several royal family members and senior FUNCINPEC officials in Paris. Sihanouk attempted to reduce tensions between FUNCINPEC and the CPP by assuring that FUNCINPEC would not leave the coalition government and that there were no reactionary elements planning to bring down Hun Sen or the CPP.

In March 1997, Sihanouk expressed his willingness to abdicate the throne, claiming that rising anti-royalist sentiment among the populace was threatening the monarchy&#x27;s existence. In response, Hun Sen tersely warned Sihanouk that he would introduce constitutional amendments to prohibit members of the royal family from participating in politics if he followed through on his suggestion. As Widyono saw it, Sihanouk remained popular with the Cambodian electorate, and Hun Sen feared that, should he abdicate and enter politics, he would win in any future elections, thereby undercutting CPP&#x27;s political clout.

In July 1997, violent clashes erupted in Phnom Penh between infantry forces separately allied to the CPP and FUNCINPEC, which effectively led to Ranariddh&#x27;s ousting after FUNCINPEC forces were defeated. Sihanouk voiced displeasure with Hun Sen for orchestrating the clashes, but refrained from calling Ranariddh&#x27;s ouster a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, a term which FUNCINPEC members used. When the National Assembly elected Ung Huot as the First Prime Minister to replace Ranariddh on 6 August 1997, Sihanouk charged that Ranariddh&#x27;s ouster was illegal and renewed his offer to abdicate the throne, a plan which did not materialize.

In September 1998, Sihanouk meditated political talks in Siem Reap after the FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) staged protests against the CPP-led government for irregularities over the 1998 general elections. The talks broke down at the end of the month after Hun Sen narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, which he accused Sam Rainsy of masterminding. Two months later, in November 1998, Sihanouk brokered a second round of political talks between the CPP and FUNCINPEC whereby an agreement was reached for another coalition government between the CPP and FUNCINPEC.

===Final years as king===
Sihanouk maintained a monthly bulletin in which he wrote commentaries on political issues and posted old photos of Cambodia in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1997, a character known by the name of &quot;Ruom Rith&quot; first appeared in his monthly bulletin, expressing critical comments on Hun Sen and the government. Hun Sen became offended by Ruom Rith&#x27;s criticisms, and on at least two occasions in 1998 and 2003 persuaded Sihanouk to stop publishing his comments. According to Ranariddh, Ruom Rith was an alter ego of Sihanouk, a claim which the latter vehemently denied. In July 2002, Sihanouk expressed concern over the absence of detailed constitutional provisions over the organization and functioning of the Cambodian throne council. When Hun Sen rejected Sihanouk&#x27;s concern, the latter followed up in September 2002 by threatening to abdicate, so as to force the throne council to convene and elect a new monarch.

In July 2003, general elections were held again, and the CPP won. However, they failed to secure two-thirds of all parliamentary seats, as required by the constitution to form a new government. The two runner-up parties of the election, FUNCINPEC and SRP, blocked the CPP from doing so. Instead, in August 2003 they filed complaints with the Constitutional Council over alleged electoral irregularities. After their complaints were rejected, FUNCINPEC and SRP threatened to boycott the swearing-in ceremony of parliamentarians. Sihanouk coaxed both parties to change their decision, stating that he would abstain from presiding over the ceremony as well if they did not comply with his wishes.

Both parties eventually backed off from their threats, and the swearing-in ceremony was held in October 2003, with Sihanouk in attendance. The CPP, FUNCINPEC, and SRP held additional talks into 2004 to break the political stalemate, but to no avail. At the same time, Sihanouk proposed a unity government jointly led by politicians from all three political parties, which Hun Sen and Ranariddh both rebuffed.

In February 2004, Sihanouk advocated and publicly backed same-sex marriage, at a time when the matter was relatively taboo and against Cambodia&#x27;s backdrop as a conservative society and was praised for his support for the nation&#x27;s LGBT demographic.

Sihanouk also engaged in pursuing philanthropy with his establishment of the &quot;Samdech Euv Team&quot; whose primary purpose is to assist in humanitarian works and projects throughout the country, of which he would later dedicate much of himself during his retirement years.

==Abdication and retirement==

On 6 July 2004, in an open letter, Sihanouk announced his plans to abdicate once again. At the same time, he criticised Hun Sen and Ranariddh for ignoring his suggestions on how to resolve the political stalemate of the past year. Meanwhile, Hun Sen and Ranariddh had agreed to introduce a constitutional amendment that provided for an open voting system, requiring parliamentarians to select cabinet ministers and the president of the National Assembly by a show of hands. Sihanouk disapproved of the open voting system, calling upon Senate President Chea Sim not to sign the amendment. When Chea Sim heeded Sihanouk&#x27;s advice, he was ferried out of the country shortly before the National Assembly convened to vote on the amendment on 15 July.

On 17 July 2004, the CPP and FUNCINPEC agreed to form a coalition government, leaving SRP out as an opposition party. On 6 October 2004, Sihanouk wrote a letter calling for the throne council to convene and select a successor. The National Assembly and Senate both held emergency meetings to pass laws allowing for the abdication of the monarch. On 14 October 2004, the throne council unanimously voted to select his son Norodom Sihamoni as Sihanouk&#x27;s successor. Sihamoni was crowned as the King of Cambodia on 29 October 2004.

In March 2005, Sihanouk accused Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam of encroaching into Cambodian territory, through unilateral border demarcation exercises without Cambodian participation. Two months later, Sihanouk formed the Supreme National Council on Border Affairs (SNCBA), which he headed, to address these concerns. While the SRP and Chea Sim expressed support for Sihanouk for the formation of the SNCBA, Hun Sen decided to form a separate body, National Authority on Border Affairs (NABA), to deal with border concerns, with SNCBA to serve only as an advisory body. After Hun Sen signed a border treaty with Vietnam in October 2005, Sihanouk dissolved the SNCBA.

In August 2007, the Cambodian Action Committee for Justice and Equity, a US-based human rights , called for Sihanouk&#x27;s State immunity to be lifted, so as to allow him to testify in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). Sihanouk responded to the call by inviting the ECCC&#x27;s United Nations chief public affairs officer, Peter Wickwire Foster, for a discussion session on his personal experience under the Khmer Rouge regime, which he said would be the only opportunity for the court to hear his testimony. The interview was to take place at the Royal Palace, and broadcast across the nation on large screens in public squares. &quot;After this it will no longer be necessary for me to present myself before the UN&#x27;s ECCC,&quot; the Kings invitation said. The note added that if the UN did not accept the invitation he &quot;will not accept to see, speak or correspond with the UN&#x27;s ECCC.&quot; Both Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC criticized the suggestion, with the latter accusing the NGO of being disrespectful. The ECCC subsequently rejected Sihanouk&#x27;s invitation on the basis of Foster not having legal authority to take testimony. On the day of the planned interview Cambodian television broke away from normal programming to broadcast an empty meeting room with staff appearing to be waiting for Foster to arrive.

The following year, bilateral relations between Thailand and Cambodia became strained due to overlapping claims on the land area surrounding Preah Vihear Temple. Sihanouk issued a communiqué in July 2008 emphasising the Khmer architecture of the temple as well as ICJ&#x27;s 1962 ruling of the temple in favour of Cambodia. In August 2009, Sihanouk stated that he would stop posting messages on his personal website as he was getting old, making it difficult for him to keep up with his personal duties. Between 2009 and 2011, Sihanouk spent most of his time in Beijing for medical care. He made a final public appearance in Phnom Penh on his 89th birthday and 20th anniversary of the Paris Peace Accords on 30 October 2011. Thereafter, Sihanouk expressed his intent to stay in Cambodia indefinitely, but returned to Beijing in January 2012 for further medical treatment at the advice of his Chinese doctors.

==Death and funeral==
In January 2012, Sihanouk issued a letter in which he expressed his wish that his body be cremated after his death, and his ashes be interred in a golden urn. A few months later, in September 2012, Sihanouk said that he would not return to Cambodia from Beijing for his 90th birthday, citing fatigue. On 15 October 2012, Sihanouk died of a heart attack at 1:20am, Phnom Penh time. When the news broke, Sihamoni, Hun Sen, and other government officials flew to Beijing to pay their last respects.

The Cambodian government announced an official mourning period of seven days between 17 and 24 October 2012, and state flags were ordered to fly at one-third height. Two days later, Sihanouk&#x27;s body was brought back from Beijing on an Air China flight, and about 1.2million people lined the streets from the airport to the royal palace to witness the return of Sihanouk&#x27;s cortège.

In late November 2012, Hun Sen said that Sihanouk&#x27;s funeral and cremation were to be carried out in February 2013. Sihanouk&#x27;s body lay in state at the royal palace for the next three months until the funeral was held on 1 February 2013. A street procession was held, and Sihanouk&#x27;s body was subsequently kept at the royal crematorium until 4 February 2013 when his body was cremated.

The following day, the royal family scattered some of Sihanouk&#x27;s ashes into the Chaktomauk river, while the rest were kept in the palace&#x27;s throne hall for about a year. In October 2013, a stupa featuring a bronze statue of Sihanouk was inaugurated next to the Independence Monument. In July 2014, Sihanouk&#x27;s ashes were interred at the silver pagoda next to those of one of his daughters, Kantha Bopha.

==Legacy==

Sihanouk was at the forefront of Cambodian public life for more than 60 years, serving in various capacities and was one of the most consequential leaders in modern Cambodian history. Indeed, as noted journalist Martin Woollacott of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said, &quot;No monarch in modern times has embodied the life and fate of his country so completely as Norodom Sihanouk.&quot;

This was reflected in him being the Guinness World Record holder for &quot;Most state roles held by a modern royal.&quot; In chronological order of positions held, Sihanouk served in the following roles: king, prime minister, head (chief) of state, regent, head of the government-in-exile, president, president-in-exile, head of the government-in-exile, president of the Supreme National Council, head of state, king.

Credited as one of the &#x27;great survivors&#x27; of contemporary Asian politics and described as a charismatic, albeit mercurial figure, observers viewed Sihanouk&#x27;s legacy as a complex one that is difficult to adequately quantify with precision with both achievements and failings in near equal measure. Sihanouk himself once referenced William Shakespeare as a means to do &#x27;literary justice&#x27; to his legacy. David Chandler and Milton Osborne, leading scholars on Cambodia, reflected on this notion, acknowledging that on one hand, as the father of Cambodian independence during the French protectorate era, he deserves great praise for his instrumental efforts that resulted in a self-governing Cambodia. On the other hand, his brief alignment with the Khmer Rouge after his ousting in the 1970 Cambodian coup d&#x27;état by Lon Nol tainted his reputation, although it was believed Sihanouk was not aware of the genocidal intentions of the Khmer Rouge, as he too, was impacted by the regime, with his house arrest and the deaths of several of his family members. Sihanouk would later formally condemn the regime and its worst excesses.
However, as Woollacott noted, given the context of the country&#x27;s tumultuous history, &quot;to Cambodians, Sihanouk represented continuity when so much in their country had been destroyed. They valued his warmth and his evident concern for his people, while recognising that he had made many mistakes.&quot; Indeed, Sihanouk&#x27;s own tumultuous life is sometimes described as mirroring that of his country and he also expressed regret at some of his shortcomings during his time at the helm of Cambodia. Chandler and Osborne observed that despite his flaws, he was devoted to his country. Moreover, this perspective is echoed by Jamie Metzl, a former Executive Vice President of the Asia Society, who commended Sihanouk&#x27;s patriotism and remarked that &quot;the totality of his life&#x27;s work demonstrates an unflappable commitment&quot; to Cambodia, notwithstanding the aforementioned reputational blight.

To that end, he commanded the deep loyalty and respect of Cambodians who &quot;throughout coups, wars, regime changes and famine - even a full-scale genocide&quot;, found in Sihanouk, whom they considered as a &quot;God king&quot;, as &quot;the one stable influence in their otherwise turbulent lives&quot;, which is also underscored by his status as the overarching unifying figure of the country. This was evident in opinion polling data released by the Cambodian Information Centre for the period between 1986 and 1997, which revealed he was the most popular leader in the country, with an approval rating ranging from a low of 56% to a high of 72% among respondents who were surveyed. According to Henri Locard, a historian specializing in Cambodia, he believes Sihanouk&#x27;s stature in the overall national consciousness is on the same level as the foremost symbols of Cambodia, such as Angkor and the national flag, calling him as &quot;the symbol of the country.&quot;

==Artistic works==
===Film-making===

Sihanouk produced about 50 films throughout his lifetime. He developed an interest in the cinema at a young age, which he attributed to frequent trips to the cinema with his parents. Shortly after becoming king in 1941, Sihanouk made a few amateur films, and sent Cambodian students to study film-making in France. When the film &quot;Lord Jim&quot; was released in 1965, Sihanouk was vexed with the negative portrayal it gave of Cambodia. In response, Sihanouk produced his first feature film, &quot;Apsara&quot;, in 1966. He went on to produce, direct, and act in eight more films between 1966 and 1969, roping in members of the royal family and military generals to star in his films.

Sihanouk expressed that his films were created with the intent of portraying Cambodia in a positive light. Milton Osborne also noted that the films were filled with Cold War and nationalist propaganda themes. Sihanouk&#x27;s former adviser, Charles Meyer, said that his films created from the 1960s were of amateur standard, while the director of Reyum Institute, Ly Daravuth, similarly commented in 2006 that his films lacked artistic qualities.

In 1967, one of his films, &quot;The Enchanted Forest&quot;, was nominated at the 5th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1968, Sihanouk launched the Phnom Penh International Film Festival, which was held for a second time in 1969. In both years, a special award category was designated, the Golden Apsara Prize, of which Sihanouk was its only nominee and winner. After Sihanouk was ousted in 1970, he ceased producing films for the next seventeen years until 1987.

In 1997, Sihanouk received a special jury prize from the International Film Festival of Moscow, where he revealed that he had received a budget ranging from to for each of his film productions from the Cambodian government. Six years later, Sihanouk donated his film archives to the École française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient in France and Monash University in Australia. In 2006, he produced his last film, &quot;Miss Asina&quot;, and then declared his retirement from film-making in May 2010.

===Music===
Sihanouk wrote at least 48 musical compositions between the late 1940s and the early 1970s, combining both traditional Khmer and Western themes into his works. From the 1940s until the 1960s, Sihanouk&#x27;s compositions were mostly based on sentimental, romantic and patriotic themes. Sihanouk&#x27;s romantic songs reflected his numerous romantic liaisons, particularly his relationship with his wife Monique, and compositions such as &quot;My Darling&quot; and &quot;Monica&quot; were dedicated to her. He also wrote nationalistic songs, meant to showcase the beauty of provincial towns and at the same time foster a sense of patriotism and national unity among Cambodians. Notable compositions, such as &quot;Flower of Battambang&quot;, &quot;Beauty of Kep City&quot;, &quot;Phnom Kulen&quot;, and &quot;Phnom Penh&quot;, are examples of these. A few of his other compositions, including &quot;Luang Prabang&quot;, &quot;Nostalgia of China&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye Bogor&quot; were sentimental songs about neighbouring countries including Laos, Indonesia, and China.

After he was ousted as head of state in 1970, Sihanouk wrote several revolutionary-style songs that praised the leaders of Communist countries, including &quot;Hommage Khmer au Maréchal Kim Il Sung&quot; and &quot;Merci, Piste Ho Chi Minh&quot;. They were intended to show his gratitude toward the Communist leaders, which had supported GRUNK between 1970 and 1975. From a young age, Sihanouk learned to play several musical instruments including the clarinet, saxophone, piano, and accordion. Filipino politician and songwriter Raul Manglapus noted in 1974 that he had held jam sessions with Sihanouk and King Bhumibol Adulyadej, both of whom he regarded as &quot;excellent saxophonists&quot;.

In the 1960s, Sihanouk led a musical band made up of his relatives, who would perform French songs and his own personal compositions for diplomats at the royal palace. In his tours across Cambodian provinces, Sihanouk was accompanied by the Royal Military Orchestra and Cambodian pop singers. Later, while Sihanouk was living in exile during the 1980s, he hosted concerts to entertain diplomats whenever he visited the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. After he was reinstated as king in 1993, Sihanouk continued to perform in concerts held at the royal palace on an occasional basis.

==Titles and styles==
Sihanouk was known by many formal and informal titles throughout his lifetime, and as aforementioned, the Guinness Book of World Records identifies Sihanouk as the royal who had served the greatest variety of state and political offices. When Sihanouk became king in 1941, he was bestowed with the official title of &quot;Preah Bat Samdech Preah Norodom Sihanouk Varman&quot; (), which he used for both reigns between 1941 and 1955 and again from 1993 to 2004. He reverted to the title of Prince after he abdicated 1955, and in that year was given by his father and successor the title of &quot;Samdech Preah Upayuvareach&quot; (), which translates in English as &quot;The Prince who has been King&quot;. Starting from the early 1960s when he became the Head of State, Sihanouk was affectionately known to most Cambodians as &quot;Samdech Euv&quot; (), which translates as the &quot;Prince Father&quot; in English.

In 2004, after his second abdication, Sihanouk became known as the King Father of Cambodia, with the official title of &quot;Preah Karuna Preah Bat Sâmdach Preah Norodom Sihanouk Preahmâhaviraksat&quot; (). He was also referred to by another honorific, &quot;His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk The Great Heroic King King-Father of Khmer independence, territorial integrity and national unity&quot; ().

At the same time, he issued a royal decree requesting to be called &quot;Samdech Ta&quot; () or &quot;Samdech Ta-tuot&quot; (), which translates as &quot;Grandfather&quot; and &quot;Great-grandfather&quot;, respectively, in English. When Sihanouk died in October 2012, he was bestowed by his son Sihamoni with the posthumous title of &quot;Preah Karuna Preah Norodom Sihanouk Preah Borom Ratanakkot&quot; (), which literally translates as &quot;The King who lies in the Diamond Urn&quot; in English.

==Personal life==

He was fluent in Khmer, French, and English, and also learned Greek and Latin in high school. In his high school days, Sihanouk played football, basketball, volleyball, and also took up horse riding. He suffered from diabetes and depression in the 1960s, which flared up again in the late 1970s while living in captivity under the Khmer Rouge.

In November 1992, Sihanouk suffered a stroke caused by the thickening of the coronary arteries and blood vessels. In 1993, he was diagnosed with B cell lymphoma in the prostate and was treated with chemotherapy and surgery. Sihanouk&#x27;s lymphoma went into remission in 1995, but returned again in 2005 in the gastric region. He suffered a third bout of lymphoma in 2008, and after prolonged treatment it went into remission the following year.

In 1960, Sihanouk built a personal residence at Chamkarmon District where he lived over the next ten years as the Head of State. Following his overthrow in 1970, Sihanouk took up residence in Beijing, where he lived at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in the first year of his stay. In 1971, Sihanouk moved to a larger residence in the city that once housed the French embassy. The residence was equipped with a temperature-adjustable swimming pool, cinema and seven chefs.

In 1974 North Korean leader Kim Il Sung built Changsuwon, a 40-room mansion, for Sihanouk. Changsuwon was built near an artificial lake, and Sihanouk spent time taking boat trips there and also shot a few films within the compound. In August 2008, Sihanouk declared his assets on his website, which according to him consisted of a small house in Siem Reap and 30,000 euros of cash savings stored in a French bank. He also stated that his residences in Beijing and Pyongyang were guesthouses owned by the governments of China and North Korea, respectively, and that they did not belong to him.

===Family===

On 4 March 1955, Sihanouk married Norodom Thavet Norleak, as his official wife, who was a cousin from his mother&#x27;s side. One day later, he married Paule Monique Izzi, as his secondary consort, who was the daughter of Pomme Peang, a Cambodian, and Jean-François Izzi, a French banker of Italian ancestry. Monique became Sihanouk&#x27;s lifelong partner; in the 1990s, she changed her name to Monineath. Before these marriages, Sihanouk married unofficially to four other women: Phat Kanhol, Sisowath Pongsanmoni, Sisowath Monikessan, and Mam Manivan Phanivong.

Monikessan died in childbirth in 1946. His marriages to the other four women, including his official wife Thavet Norleak, all ended in divorce. Sihanouk had fourteen children with five different wives. Thavet Norleak bore him no children. During the Khmer Rouge years, five children and fourteen grandchildren disappeared. Sihanouk believed they were killed by the Khmer Rouge.

Sihanouk had the following issue:

<doc id="80052" wikidata="Q316006" url="?curid=80052" title="Stephen, Count of Blois">
<text>Stephen Henry (in French, &quot;Étienne Henri&quot;, in Medieval French, &quot;Estienne Henri&quot;; – 19 May 1102) was the count of Blois and Count of Chartres. He led an army during the First Crusade, was at the surrender of the city of Nicaea, and directed the siege of Antioch. Returning home without fulfilling his crusader vows, Stephen joined the crusade of 1101. Making his way to Jerusalem, he fought in the Second Battle of Ramla, where he was captured and later executed.

==Life==
Stephen was the son of Theobald III, count of Blois, and Gersent of Le Mans. He is first mentioned as approaching William the Conqueror to ask for and receive the hand of his daughter Adela of Normandy. In 1089, upon the death of his father, Stephen became the Count of Blois and Chartres, although Theobald had given him the administration of those holdings in 1074.

Stephen was one of the leaders of the First Crusade, leading one of the major armies of the crusade and often writing enthusiastic letters to his wife about the crusade&#x27;s progress. Present at the Siege of Nicaea, he wrote that the defenders surrendered out of fear of the siege towers. 

At some point either before or at the beginning of the Siege of Antioch in October 1098, he was chosen as &#x27;leader&#x27; of the army, a function that seems to not have gone much beyond presiding over the assemblies of the leaders as well as provisioning and housekeeping duties for the armies.
Stephen retreated from the siege on 2 June 1098, the day before the capture of the city, leaving his comrades behind in a difficult situation, as a superior Turkish army under Kerbogha was approaching. Critically, on the way back to the West he met the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos, who was marching with an army to assist the crusaders, and persuaded him of the futility of his expedition. 

Alexios&#x27;s consequent decision to turn around contributed to the ongoing suspicion of the crusaders that the Byzantines were not to be trusted and to the later conflicts between crusaders and Byzantium. Having returned with unfulfilled vows and the ignominy of abandoning his comrades, Stephen was in disgrace. His wife Adela pleaded with him to make a second pilgrimage, and he joined the subsequent Crusade of 1101 in the company of others who had also returned home prematurely. 

He participated in the disastrous campaign in Anatolia to free Bohemond from prison, then sailed from Constantinople to St Simeon and thence Jerusalem, finally fulfilling his vows. In 1102, already on his way back home, he was persuaded by King Baldwin of Jerusalem to fight in the Second Battle of Ramla against the Fatimids. He was taken prisoner and executed, probably in Ascalon on 19 May.

==Family==
Stephen married Adela of Normandy, a daughter of William the Conqueror, around 1090 in Chartres. Their children were:
# William, Count of Sully
# Theobald II, Count of Blois
# Odo, who died young
# Stephen, King of England
# Matilda, married Richard d&#x27;Avranches, 2nd Earl of Chester. Both drowned on 25 November 1120 in the &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster.
# Agnes, married Hugh III of Le Puiset
#Eleanor (died 1147) married Ralph I, Count of Vermandois; they were divorced in 1142.
# Alix (c. 1095 – 1145) married Renaud III of Joigni (d. 1134) and had issue
# Adelaide, married Milo II of Montlhéry, Viscount of Troyes (divorced 1115)
# Henry, Bishop of Winchester (c. 1096 – 1171)
# Humbert, died young

A late 14th century source gives Stephen an illegitimate daughter Emma, wife of Herbert of Winchester and mother of William of York, archbishop of York, but recent research suggests a different parentage for her.

<text>Lê Duẩn (; 7 April 1907 – 10 July 1986) was a Vietnamese communist politician. He rose in the party hierarchy in the late 1950s and became General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam (VCP) at the 3rd National Congress in 1960. When Ho Chi Minh died in 1969, he consolidated power to become the undisputed leader of North Vietnam. Upon defeating South Vietnam in the Second Indochina War in 1975, he subsequently ruled the newly unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam from 1976 until his death in 1986. 

He was born into a lower-class family in Quảng Trị Province, in the Annam Protectorate of French Indochina as Lê Văn Nhuận. Little is known about his family and childhood. He first came in contact with revolutionary thoughts in the 1920s through his work as a railway clerk. Lê Duẩn was a founding member of the Indochina Communist Party (the future Communist Party of Vietnam) in 1930. He was imprisoned in 1931 and released in 1937. From 1937 to 1939, he climbed the party ladder. He was rearrested in 1939, this time for fomenting an uprising in the South. Lê Duẩn was released from jail following the successful Communist-led August Revolution of 1945.

During the First Indochina War (1946-1954), Lê Duẩn was an active revolutionary leader in South Vietnam. He headed the Central Office of South Vietnam, a Party organ, from 1951 until 1954. During the 1950s Lê Duẩn became increasingly aggressive towards South Vietnam and called for reunification through war. By the mid-to-late 1950s Lê Duẩn had become the second-most powerful policy-maker within the Party, eclipsing former party First Secretary Trường Chinh. By 1960 he was officially the second-most powerful Party member, after Party chairman Hồ. Throughout the 1960s, Hồ&#x27;s health declined and Lê Duẩn assumed more of his responsibilities. 

Following Hồ&#x27;s death in 1969, Lê Duẩn assumed leadership of North Vietnam. Throughout the Second Indochina War (1955–1975), he adopted an aggressive posture, prioritizing the use of large-scale attacks in order to achieve victory. When South Vietnam was reunited with North Vietnam in 1976, he assumed the new title of General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Later in December 1978, Lê Duẩn oversaw the Vietnam&#x27;s invasion of Cambodia which ultimately led to the fall of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge on 7 January 1979. This had a serious impact on relations between Vietnam and China, with Vietnam responding with a period of deportation of ethnic Chinese Hoa people. China carried out an invasion on the Vietnamese northern border which was to be known as the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979, though was short-lived and remained inconclusive. From then on, Vietnam maintained a closer alliance with the Soviet Union and joined Comecon in 1978. 

Lê remained General Secretary until his death in 1986. He died in Hanoi; his successor was initially Trường Chinh. Lê Duẩn was also known as Lê Dung, and was known in public as &quot;anh Ba&quot; (third brother).
== Early life and career ==
Lê Duẩn was born as Lê Văn Nhuận in &quot;Bich La&quot; village, &quot;Triệu Đông&quot;, Triệu Phong, Quảng Trị Province on 7 April 1907 (although some sources cite 1908) to a poor family with 5 children. Locals from his generation say that Duan&#x27;s parents were metal scrap collectors and blacksmiths. The son of a railway clerk, he became active in revolutionary politics as a young man. He received a French colonial education before working as a clerk for the Vietnam Railway Company in Hanoi during the 1920s. Through his job, he came into contact with several communist activists. In this period, he educated himself to a Marxist.

Lê Duẩn became a member of the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League in 1928. He cofounded the Indochina Communist Party in 1930. Lê Duẩn was imprisoned the next year. He was released six years later, in 1937. From 1937 to 1939 he advanced in the party hierarchy and at the &quot;2nd National Congress&quot;, he joined its Central Committee. He was imprisoned again the following year for fomenting an uprising. After five years he was released, shortly after the 1945 August Revolution, in which the Indochinese Communist Party took power. Following his release, he became a trusted associate of Hồ Chí Minh, the lead figure of the party.

During the First Indochina War Lê Duẩn served as the &quot;Secretary of the Regional Committee of South Vietnam&quot;, at first in Cochinchina in 1946, but was reassigned to head the Central Office of South Vietnam from 1951 until 1954. The Viet Minh&#x27;s position in the South became increasingly tenuous by the early to mid-1950s and in 1953 Lê Duẩn was replaced by his deputy Lê Đức Thọ and moved to North Vietnam.

=== The &quot;Road to the South&quot; ===

In the aftermath of the 1954 Geneva Accords, which indirectly split Vietnam into North and South, Lê Duẩn was responsible for reorganising the combatants who had fought in South and Central Vietnam. In 1956, he wrote &quot;The Road to the South&quot;, calling for revolution to achieve reunification. His thesis became the blueprint for action at the &quot;11th Central Committee Plenum&quot; in 1956. Although &quot;The Road to the South&quot; was formally accepted, its implementation waited until 1959.

In 1956 Lê Duẩn was appointed to the secretariat of the party. He was ordered by the Politburo in August 1956 to guide the revolutionary struggle in South Vietnam. The same month he traveled from U Minh to Bến Tre and instructed the southern communists to stop fighting in the name of religious sects. Throughout the year, the party had been split by factional rivalry between party boss Trường Chinh and President Hồ, who was supported by Võ Nguyên Giáp. This rivalry focused on the issue of land reform in the North. Lê Duẩn remained neutral, allowing him to act as the First Secretary (head of the Communist Party) on Hồ&#x27;s behalf in late 1956. In 1957, he was given a seat in the Politburo.

At the 1957 May Day parade, Trường Chinh was still seated as the country&#x27;s second most powerful figure. Lê Duẩn was gradually able to place his supporters, notably Lê Ðức Thọ, in top positions and outmaneuver his rivals. He visited Moscow in November 1957 and received approval for his war plans. In December 1957, Hồ told the 13th Plenary Session of a &quot;dual revolution&quot;; Trường Chinh became responsible for the socialist transformation of the north, while Lê Duẩn focused on planning the offensive in the south.

By 1958, Lê Duẩn ranked second only to Hồ in the party hierarchy, although Trường Chinh remained powerful. Lê Duẩn was a party man and never held a post in the government. He made a brief, secret visit to South Vietnam in 1958, writing a report, &quot;The Path to Revolution in the South&quot;, in which he stated that the North Vietnamese had to do more to assist the southern fighters. The Central Committee decided to initiate the revolution in January 1959.

=== First Secretary ===
Lê Duẩn was informally chosen as the First Secretary of the party by Hồ in 1959, at the January plenum of the Central Committee and was elected to the post &quot;de jure&quot; at the &quot;3rd National Congress&quot;. According to Bùi Tín he was not Hồ&#x27;s original choice for the post; his preferred candidate was Võ Nguyên Giáp, but since Lê Duẩn was supported by the influential Lê Đức Thọ, the &quot;Head of the Party Organisational Department,&quot; Lê Duẩn was picked for the post. He was considered a safe choice because of his time in prison during the French rule, his thesis &quot;The Road to the South&quot; and his strong belief in Vietnamese reunification. Hoàng Văn Hoan claimed, after being sent into exile, that the Congress also purged several party members. Indeed, three former ambassadors lost their Central Committee seats.

== General Secretary leadership ==

=== Political infighting and power ===
Lê Duẩn was officially named First Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1960, thereby succeeding Hồ as the party&#x27;s de facto leader even though the latter remained its chairman. However, Hồ continued to influence North Vietnam&#x27;s governance: Lê Duẩn, Tố Hữu, Trường Chinh and Phạm Văn Đồng (all of whom were influential figures in the country&#x27;s politics during and after the war) often shared dinner with him. In 1963, Hồ purportedly corresponded with South Vietnamese President Ngô Đình Diệm in the hope of achieving a negotiated peace. Together with Lê Đức Thọ, &quot;Head of the Party Organisational Department&quot; and Nguyễn Chí Thanh, a military general, Lê Duẩn tried to monopolise the decision-making process – this became even more evident following Hồ&#x27;s death. In 1964, Hồ&#x27;s health began to fail and Lê Duẩn, as his trusted underling, more visibly took on day-to-day decision-making responsibilities. Some analysts claim that by 1965 Hồ and Lê Duẩn had split and that &quot;for all intents and purposes&quot; Lê Duẩn had sidelined Hồ. Lê Duẩn, Lê Đức Thọ and Phạm Hùng &quot;progressively tried to neutralise Hồ Chí Minh&quot; and Phạm Văn Đồng.

By the late-1960s, Hồ&#x27;s declining health had weakened his position within the leadership. While Hồ was still consulted on important decisions, Lê Duẩn dominated the Party. When Hồ died on 2 September 1969, the collective leadership he had espoused continued, but Lê Duẩn was first among equals. The Central Committee&#x27;s first resolution following Hồ&#x27;s death pledged to uphold the collective leadership. Lê Duẩn chaired Hồ&#x27;s funeral committee and gave the event&#x27;s final speech.

From the beginning the party leadership had split into pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese and moderate factions. Under Hồ the party had followed a policy of neutrality between the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the aftermath of the Sino–Soviet split. This policy continued until reunification. In the aftermath of the war, a power struggle began between Lê Duẩn&#x27;s pro-Soviet and its rival pro-Chinese factions. Former rivals Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ formed a coalition and purged the pro-Chinese faction. Their first victims were Hoàng Văn Hoan and Chu Văn Tấn. While the Politburo made decisions through consensus, Lê Duẩn, through his post as General Secretary, was the most powerful figure and was able to increase his power via his alliance with Lê Đức Thọ, Trần Quốc Hoàn and Võ Nguyên Giáp. Together with Lê Đức Thọ, Lê Duẩn controlled personnel appointments in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the General Political Directorate of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN), the General Logistics Department of the PAVN and the Ministry of Transport.

To strengthen their hold on power, Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ established a patronage network. For instance Lê Đức Thọ&#x27;s brother, Đinh Đức Thiện was appointed Minister of Communications and Transport; in April 1982 Đồng Sĩ Nguyên, a protégé of Lê Duẩn, became Minister of Transport. Mai Chí Thọ, friend of Lê Đức Thọ, was Chairman of the People&#x27;s Committee of Hồ Chí Minh City (equivalent to a mayor) from 1978 to 1985. Several of Lê Duẩn&#x27;s relatives were appointed to offices in the propaganda and culture sector. However, with the exception of Mai Chí Thọ none of these figures reached the pinnacles of power in Vietnamese politics.

=== Vietnam War ===
At the 3rd National Congress, Lê Duẩn called for the establishment of a South Vietnamese people&#x27;s front. The Central Committee supported the proposal. A Central Committee resolution stated that &quot;The common task of the Vietnamese revolution at present is to accelerate the socialist revolution in North Vietnam whilst at the same time stepping up the National People&#x27;s Democratic Revolution in South Vietnam.&quot; On 20 December 1960, three months later, the Viet Cong was established. Lê Duẩn claimed that the Việt Cộng would &quot;rally &#x27;all patriotic forces&#x27; to overthrow the Diệm government [in the South] and thus ensure &#x27;conditions for the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland&#x27;&quot;.

After the Sino–Soviet split, the Vietnamese Communist leadership divided into pro-China and pro-Soviet factions. From 1956 to 1963, Lê Duẩn played a moderating role between the two factions, but with the death of Diệm and the Gulf of Tonkin incident, he became considerably more radical. The Chinese continued to support them throughout the war, with Liu Shaoqi, the President of the People&#x27;s Republic, in 1965 stating, &quot;it is our policy that we will do our best to support you.&quot; Unlike Hồ, who wanted a peaceful resolution, Lê Duẩn was far more militant. He wanted, in his own words, &quot;final victory&quot;. Howard Jones claimed Duẩn dismissed Hồ&#x27;s position, as did the majority of the Politburo, calling him &quot;naive&quot;. When Hồ called for the establishment of a neutral South Vietnamese state in 1963, Lê Duẩn responded by making overtures to the Chinese, who rejected the Soviet position of peaceful coexistence.

With the increased involvement of the United States military in 1965, the North&#x27;s military strategy was forced to change. As Lê Duẩn noted in a letter to Nguyễn Chí Thanh, the war would become &quot;fiercer and longer&quot;. He believed the fundamentals of the conflict had not changed; the South Vietnamese regime&#x27;s unpopularity remained its &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot; and he continued to advocate a combination of guerrilla warfare and PAVN offensives. The communist commanders in the South were to avoid large attacks on the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), but instead focus on many small attacks to demoralize the enemy. Lê Duẩn believed that the key to victory was for the PAVN to keep the initiative. He dismissed the possibility of an attack against North Vietnam by American forces, claiming that an attack on North Vietnam would be an attack on the entire socialist camp.

In 1967, despite the opposition of some party leaders, Lê Duẩn and his militant group adopted General Nguyễn Chí Thanh&#x27;s operational plan for the General Offensive/General Uprising involving attacks on ARVN and Republic of Vietnam Government installations throughout South Vietnam, which they believed would spark a spontaneous popular uprising among the South Vietnamese population forcing the US and its allies to depart. After having sidelined, and in some cases arrested, opponents of the plan, this would be adopted as the official strategy to win the war. The General Offensive/General Uprising would be launched during the Tết holiday in January/February 1968. The Tet Offensive would prove to be a military defeat, but a strategic success. Despite the failure of the offensive, the North Vietnamese launched a Phase II attack in May 1968 and a Phase III attack in August 1968, both of which were repulsed, with the PAVN and VC again suffering large casualties. After the failure of these attacks, COSVN issued Directive 55 on 5 April 1969 to all of its subordinate units: &quot;Never again and under no circumstances are we going to risk our entire military force for just such an offensive. On the contrary, we should endeavor to preserve our military potential for future campaigns.&quot;

By July 1974, following the cut-off of U.S aid to South Vietnam, the North Vietnamese leadership had decided to abrogate the Paris Peace Accords and to invade in 1975, instead of 1976 as previously planned, because they believed an earlier Vietnamese unification would put Vietnam in a stronger position against Chinese and Soviet influence. In his victory speech, Lê Duẩn stated: &quot;Our party is the unique and single leader that organised, controlled and governed the entire struggle of the Vietnamese people from the first day of the revolution.&quot; In his speech he congratulated the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRGRSV), the underground South Vietnamese government established in 1969, for liberating South Vietnam from imperialism. PRGRSV-ruled South Vietnam did not last long, however, and in 1976 the reunified Socialist Republic of Vietnam was established. Lê Duẩn purged South Vietnamese who had fought against the North, imprisoning up to 300,000 people in re-education camps (not including &quot;dissidents detained in the many prisons of Vietnam&quot;) and captured Hoa people&#x27;s property (the Chinese who live in Vietnam), setting off a mass exodus and humanitarian disaster (see Vietnamese boat people).

=== Economy ===


Vietnam developed little during the war years; industry was nearly non-existent in both North and South and both countries were dependent on foreign donor countries. Worse, the country&#x27;s critical agricultural infrastructure had been badly damaged. The South had roughly 20,000 bomb craters, 10 million refugees, 362,000 war invalids, 1,000,000 widows, 880,000 orphans, 250,000 drug addicts, 300,000 prostitutes and 3 million unemployed.

Having won the war and defeated Republic of Vietnam, Lê Duẩn&#x27;s mood in April 1975 was optimistic. As one Central Committee member put it, &quot;Now nothing more can happen. The problems we face now are trifles compared to those in the past.&quot; Lê Duẩn promised the Vietnamese people in 1976 that each family would own a radio set, refrigerator and TV within ten years; he seemed to believe he could easily integrate the South Vietnamese consumer society with agrarian North Vietnam. In 1976 the 4th National Congress declared Vietnam would complete its socialist transformation within twenty years. This optimism proved unfounded; instead Vietnam staggered from one economic crisis to another.

After the war, per-capita income stood at US$101; it decreased to $91 in 1980 and then increased to $99 by 1982, according to United Nations figures. Phạm Văn Đồng admitted that per-capita income &quot;had not increased compared to what it was ten years ago&quot;. Physical health declined and malnutrition increased under Lê Duẩn, according to the Ministry of Health. According to the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, an estimated 6,000,000 Vietnamese were suffering from malnutrition, leading the government to request aid from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Lê Duẩn&#x27;s policies and the war against Pol Pot (1976-1979) and China (1979) led to an abrupt decline in the standard of living; monthly per capita income in the North declined from $82 in 1976 to $58 in 1980.

The main goals of the Second Five-Year Plan (1976–80), which was initiated at the 4th National Congress, were as follows;

# &quot;Concentrate the forces of the whole country to achieve a leap forward in agriculture; vigorously develop light industry&quot;.
# &quot;[T]urn to full account existing heavy industry capacity and build many new industrial installations, especially in the machine industry, so as to support primary agriculture and light industry&quot;.
# &quot;[V]irtually complete socialist transformation in the South&quot;.

The Vietnamese leadership expected to reach these targets with economic aid from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and loans from international agencies of the capitalist world. The 4th National Congress made it clear that agriculture would be socialised; however, during the Second Five-Year Plan the socialisation measures went so badly that Võ Chí Công, a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture, claimed it would be impossible to meet the targets set by the plan by 1980. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives, established during the plan, had collapsed in the South by 1980. Politburo member Lê Thanh Nghị attacked lower-level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation. The collectivisation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978, leading the 6th Plenum of the Central Committee to completely overhaul the Party&#x27;s agricultural policies.

With regard to heavy industry, the leadership&#x27;s position was muddled. In his &quot;Fourth Political Report&quot; Lê Duẩn stated that during the transition to socialism, priority would be given to heavy industry &quot;on the basis of developing agriculture and light industry&quot;. In another section of the report, Lê Duẩn stated that light industry would be prioritised ahead of heavy industry. The position of Phạm Văn Đồng, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (the head of government), was just as confused as Lê Duẩn&#x27;s. In practice Lê Duẩn prioritised heavy industry: 21.4% of state investment was in heavy industry in the Second Five-Year Plan and 29.7 percent in the Third Five-Year Plan (1981–85). Light industry only received 10.5 and 11.5, respectively. From 1976 to 1978 industry grew, but from 1979 to 1980 industrial production fell substantially. During the Second Five-Year Plan industry grew just 0.1 percent. The 6th Plenum of the Central Committee criticised the policy that the state had to own everything.

Before the 5th Central Committee Plenum, Lê Duẩn believed that Vietnam was in a perilous position, although no talk of reforms followed. Beginning in 1979, Lê Duẩn acknowledged that economic policy mistakes had been made by the national Party and State leadership.

Until the 6th plenum, the planners prevailed. That plenum condemned the old ways and promised that from then on the economy would be governed by &quot;objective laws&quot;. The roles of the plan and the market were openly discussed for the first time and the roles of the family and the private economy were enhanced and certain market prices were officially supported by the Party. Lê Duẩn endorsed the reforms at the 1982 5th National Congress. Lê Duẩn talked about the need to strengthen both the central planned economy and the local economy at once. In his report Lê Duẩn admitted that the Second Five-Year Plan had been a failure economically.

At the beginning these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres. From 1981 to 1984 agricultural production grew substantially, but the government did not use this opportunity to increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer, pesticide and fuel, nor of consumer goods. By the end of Lê Duẩn&#x27;s rule, in 1985–1986, inflation had reached over 100% annually, complicating economic policy-making.

=== Foreign relations ===

==== Relations with the Eastern Bloc ====

Lê Duẩn visited the Soviet Union in October 1975. The result of the visit was an official communique, which stated that the Soviets would send qualified experts to the country to educate and train economic, scientific, technical and cultural personnel. The Soviet Union gave Vietnam economic assistance and supported several national economic projects on most favoured terms. The communique stated that cooperation was within the &quot;frameworks of multilateral cooperation of socialist countries.&quot; Such a statement would normally have meant membership in COMECON, but Vietnam was not a member, wanting to establish its sovereignty. Phạm Văn Đồng snubbed the Soviet ambassador during the anniversary of the October Revolution and rejected key Soviet foreign policies. Despite continued pressure from the Soviets to join COMECON, Vietnam declined. Instead Vietnam joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, moves the Soviet Union opposed.

Vietnam relented in 1978, seeking economic aid to fund the Second Five-Year Plan. In 1978 Lê Duẩn and Phạm Văn Đồng signed a 25-year Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Cooperation with the USSR. Under Soviet protection, Vietnam invaded Kampuchea. In reaction China invaded Vietnam. Vietnam leased several bases to the Soviet Union to protect its territory from China. It was rumored that one of China&#x27;s demands for peace was the ending of Soviet assistance to Vietnam. In Asia Vietnam played a role similar to Cuba&#x27;s in Latin America: it supported local revolutionary groups and was a headquarters for Soviet-style communism. Vietnam supported the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and received $3 million a day in military aid.

At the 5th National Congress, Lê Duẩn reaffirmed Vietnam&#x27;s relations with the USSR. He stated, &quot;Solidarity and co-operation with the USSR: such is the corner stone of the external policy of our Party and of our State.&quot; He further noted that their alliance was &quot;a guarantee of the victory of the defense of the motherland and the socialist edification of our people.&quot; Soviet official Mikhail Gorbachev echoed Lê Duẩn&#x27;s sentiments and said &quot;Vietnam can count on the solidarity and the support of the USSR.&quot;

Lê Duẩn&#x27;s foreign policy was criticised by Hoàng Văn Hoan, who accused him of sacrificing the country&#x27;s sovereignty. A delegation led by Vitaly Vorotnikov, visited Vietnam during its National Day, the holiday that celebrated the establishment of North Vietnam after the August Revolution and met with Lê Duẩn. Lê Duẩn attended the 27th Communist Party Congress and later met with Gorbachev. Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and Anatoly Dobrynin attended Lê Duẩn&#x27;s funeral.

==== Relations with China ====
During the Vietnam War, the Chinese claimed that the Soviet Union would betray North Vietnam. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai told Lê Duẩn that the Soviets would lie to them to improve its relationship with the United States. According to Zhou this policy was enacted following Alexei Kosygin&#x27;s departure from Vietnam in 1965. Lê Duẩn did not accept this view and at the 23rd Party Congress (which China boycotted) he referred to the Soviet Union as a &quot;second motherland&quot;. Because of his statement, China immediately began to cut its aid to North Vietnam. According to the first secretary at the Soviet embassy to China, the North Vietnamese saw the Chinese actions as an attack on them. At the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s 45th anniversary, instead of a communique by Hồ Chí Minh, Phạm Văn Đồng and Lê Duẩn as had happened at the 44th anniversary, the Vietnamese Central Committee offered official greetings, but without signatures from top-level officials.

Relations between the two countries further deteriorated following the China/US rapprochement. The North Vietnamese, who were still fighting the Americans, felt betrayed. At the CPV Politburo meeting on 16 July 1971, the North Vietnamese agreed that Chinese policy towards the United States was like a &quot;torpedo&quot; directed against North Vietnam. Zhou was told by Phạm Văn Đồng and Lê Duẩn that US President Richard Nixon&#x27;s upcoming visit to China was &quot;against the interests of Vietnam&quot;. Later, in November, Phạm asked the Chinese to cancel Nixon&#x27;s visit; the Chinese refused. The North Vietnamese began to doubt China and they hid information about North Vietnam&#x27;s next planned military offensive. The Sino/US rapprochement did not hurt Sino/Vietnamese relations in the long run, because the Soviet Union also eventually reconciled with the US.

Chinese and North Vietnamese documents state that relations between them worsened in 1973–75. A Vietnamese document claimed that China hindered the eventual reunification, while Chinese documents claimed that the source of the conflict was Vietnamese policy towards the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. However, the core issue for the Chinese was to minimize Vietnam&#x27;s cooperation with the Soviets. Increasing Soviet/Vietnamese cooperation left China ambivalent about reunification.

During Lê Duẩn&#x27;s China visit in June 1973, Zhou told him that North Vietnam should adhere to the Paris Peace Accords. Following the signing, Lê Thanh Nghị stated that the direction of Vietnam&#x27;s communism was directly linked to its relations with the Soviet Union. The Chinese opposed immediate reunification and to that end, began making economic agreements with the Provisional Revolutionary (Communist) Government of South Vietnam (PRGSV). PRGSV head Nguyễn Hữu Thọ was treated well by the Chinese. This policy further damaged relations. China and Vietnam drifted further apart; eventual Chinese aid did not improve relations.

Lê Thanh unsuccessfully visited China in August 1975 to seek aid. On 22–28 September, Lê Duẩn and Lê Thanh visited China in a second attempt. During the visit the Vietnamese wanted to assure the Chinese they were interested in maintaining good relations with both China and the Soviet Union. Deng Xiaoping stated that both superpowers acted as imperialists and sought hegemony. Lê Duẩn in a speech did not mention the Soviet Union by name, but noted that Vietnam had succeeded because of help from other socialist countries, meaning the Eastern bloc. Two agreements were signed, but no non-refundable aid agreement was made. No joint communique was issued and Lê Duẩn left earlier than planned. According to Anne Gilks, the Sino/Vietnamese alliance effectively ended with the Fall of Saigon. Relations with China further deteriorated; several leading pro-Chinese communists were purged from the party.

Lê Duẩn visited China from 20 to 25 November 1977 to seek aid. CPC Chairman Hua Guofeng stated that Sino/Vietnamese relations had deteriorated because they held different principles. Hua insisted that China could not help Vietnam because of its own economic difficulties and differences in principles. Lê Duẩn countered that the only difference was how they viewed the Soviet Union and the United States. Following his visit, China&#x27;s state-run Xinhua News Agency condemned COMECON. China halted all economic development projects between May and July 1978. During this period total Chinese aid to Vietnam amounted to $300 million.

==== Sino-Vietnamese War ====

On 17 February 1979, the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army crossed the Vietnamese border, withdrawing on 5 March after a two-week campaign which devastated northern Vietnam and briefly threatened Hanoi. Both China (40,000) and Vietnam (over 20,000) suffered heavy losses. Peace talks broke down in December 1979 and both China (400,000) and Vietnam (600,000) began a major build-up of forces along the border. Sporadic fighting on the border occurred throughout the 1980s and China threatened to force Vietnam&#x27;s exit from Kampuchea.

==== Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia ====

The independent Kampuchean Communist Party (KCP) was established alongside the Vietnamese and Laotian parties following the dissolution of the Indochinese Communist Party in 1955. The Kampuchean movement was the weakest of the three. When the Vietnamese began formal military aid to the Khmer Rouge in 1970, the Khmer leadership remained skeptical. On the orders of Võ Chí Công two regiments were sent into Kampuchea. Võ Chí Công promised Khmer leader Ieng Sary that Vietnamese troops would withdraw when the conflict had been won by the communists. The entry of Vietnamese troops led many Vietnamese officials to believe that Khmer Rouge officials had begun &quot;to fear something&quot;. In a conversation with Phạm Hùng, Lê Duẩn told him that despite some differences in opinions, the &quot;authentic internationalism and attitude&quot; of the sides would strengthen their party-to-party relations. After reading reports by Võ Chí Công, Lê Duẩn probably concluded that &quot;authentic internationalism&quot; in Kampuchea was in trouble. At the time, the Vietnamese leadership hoped this situation would change, but privately they understood that the Kampuchean situation was different from the Lao situation.
After Pol Pot and his supporters seized control of KCP in 1973, KCP/VCP relations deteriorated sharply. North Vietnamese formations that were active in Kampuchea during the civil war were thereafter regularly attacked by their allies. By 1976, while it appeared that Kampuchea/Vietnam relations were normalizing, private suspicions within the respective leaderships grew. Lê Duẩn, Tôn Đức Thắng, Trường Chinh and Phạm Văn Đồng sent messages congratulating the ascension of Pol Pot, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea as Premier, President of the Presidium and President of the Assembly of the People&#x27;s Representative, respectively. In turn, KCP sent a congratulatory message to the PRGRSV on its seventh anniversary. On 21 September 1976 a Vietnamese women&#x27;s delegation visited Kampuchea and the KCP sent public greetings to the 4th National Congress. The Vietnamese leadership hoped that pro-Vietnamese elements would develop within the KCP. When Kampuchean radio announced Pol Pot&#x27;s resignation, Lê Duẩn and the Vietnamese leadership took it seriously. During a meeting with the Soviet ambassador, Lê Duẩn told him that Pol Pot and Ieng Sary had been removed from the KCP leadership. The change was welcome to Vietnam, since the two were a &quot;pro-Chinese sect conducting a crude and severe policy.&quot; Lê Duẩn added that &quot;these were bad people [the KCP leadership headed by Pol Pot]&quot;, but that Nuon Chea was &quot;our man and is my personal friend.&quot; All-out confrontation was not planned and Lê Duẩn still believed that state-to-state relations could improve. He further noted that Kampuchea would eventually become like Laos, a socialist state, and value its relationship with Vietnam and the Soviet Union.

On 30 April 1977, Democratic Kampuchea attacked several Vietnamese villages in An Giang Province, most notably in the Ba Chúc massacre. The Vietnamese leadership was shocked by this unprovoked attack and counterattacked. Vietnam still sought improved relations and when Pol Pot, on 27 September 1977, announced the existence of the KCP, Vietnam sent a congratulatory note. In a conversation with the Soviet ambassador on 6 October, Lê Duẩn had no explanation for Kampuchea&#x27;s actions. He described the leadership as &quot;strongly nationalistic and under strong influence of Peking [China].&quot; Lê Duẩn called Pol Pot a Trotskyist while claiming that Ieng Sary was &quot;a fierce nationalist and pro-Chinese.&quot; He erroneously believed that Nuon Chea and Son Sen harbored pro-Vietnamese views.

On 31 December 1977, Kampuchea broke relations with Vietnam, stating that the &quot;aggressor forces&quot; from Vietnam sent had to be withdrawn. This was needed to &quot;restore the friendly atmosphere between the two countries.&quot; While they accused Vietnam of aggression, the real problem all along was the Vietnamese leadership&#x27; plan, or ideal, of establishing a Vietnamese-dominated Indochinese Federation. Vietnamese troops withdrew from the country in January, taking thousands of prisoners and civilian refugees. While the point of the Vietnamese attack had been to dampen the Kampuchean leadership&#x27;s aggressive stance, it had the opposite effect – the Kampuchean leadership treated it as a major victory over Vietnam, matching their victory over the Americans. Kampuchea did not respond to diplomatic overtures and began another attack. Vietnam responded by promoting an uprising against Pol Pot&#x27;s rule and invaded.

On 15 June 1978, the VCP Politburo sent a request to the Soviet Union to allow a delegation headed by Lê Duẩn to meet with Leonid Brezhnev and the Soviet leadership in general. In a meeting with the Soviet ambassador in September, Lê Duẩn said that Vietnam intended &quot;to solve fully this question [of Kampuchea] by the beginning of 1979.&quot; Lê Duẩn did not believe that China would retaliate because it would have to send its forces by sea, although China did attack in 1979, but chose Vietnam as its target. He claimed that Vietnam had little time and that waiting would benefit China. He further claimed that Vietnam had established nine battalions of Khmer deserters and that it was seeking Sao Pheum to lead them. In fact, Sao Pheum had been dead for three months. Lê Duẩn still believed that Nuon Chea was a friend of Vietnam, despite his largely anti-Vietnam speech. Nuon Chea and Son Sen remained staunch Pol Pot supporters until the 1990s.

Vietnam sent 13 divisions into the country on 25 December 1978, with an estimated 150,000 soldiers supported by heavy artillery and air power. Kampuchea attempted a conventional defense, but this tactic led to the loss of half of its army within two weeks. The defeats prompted much of the Kampuchean leadership to evacuate to the western region of the country. On 7 January 1979, the PAVN and the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation entered Phnom Penh. On the following day, a pro-Vietnamese state, known as the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established, with Heng Samrin as head of state and Pen Sovan as General Secretary of the Kampuchean People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party. The struggle between the Khmer Rouge and the PRK ended only with Vietnam&#x27;s withdrawal in 1989.

=== Last years and death ===

By the time of the 5th National Congress, the party leadership had turned into a veritable gerontocracy. The five most powerful Politburo members were all over the age of 70; Lê Duẩn was 74, Trường Chinh was 75, Phạm Văn Đồng was 76, Phạm Hùng was 70 and Lê Đức Thọ was 72. Lê Duẩn is believed to have been in bad health during this period; he had travelled to the Soviet Union on several occasions for medical treatment during the late-1970s and early 1980s. It was reported that Lê Duẩn did not lead the party delegates of the 5th National Congress to the Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum because of his deteriorating health. Lê Duẩn looked both feeble and old; he had problems reading his report to the Congress.

Regardless of his health, the Lê Duẩn/Lê Đức Thọ clique still retained considerable power during the 5th National Congress; they were able to fill the 5th Central Committee, the 5th Secretariat and the 5th Politburo with their own supporters. Several moderates and old companions of Hồ Chí Minh as well as pro-Chinese communists (labelled dismissively as Maoists) and followers of Trường Chinh were removed from the Politburo and the Central Committee. General Võ Nguyên Giáp was forced to leave the Politburo, though it was more to remove Giap as a figure of influence rather than for ideological reasons. Nguyễn Duy Trinh and Lê Thanh Nghị were removed from the Politburo because of their moderate stances, while Trần Quốc Hoàn, Lê Văn Lương and Nguyễn Văn Linh were removed because of their alignment with Trường Chinh. In their place Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ appointed military men, including Đỗ Mười, Lê Đức Anh and General Đồng Sĩ Nguyên. The appointment of Nguyễn Đức Tâm and Nguyễn Cơ Thạch strengthened Lê Đức Thọ. The Lê Duẩn/Lê Đức Thọ clique thereafter had a clear majority within the 5th Secretariat.

Lê Duẩn&#x27;s report to the 5th National Congress was a biting self-criticism of his leadership and the party&#x27;s management. He criticised political and economic corruption and the gerontocracy itself. The 5th Central Committee contained only one member under 60. During this period the Central Committee was disrupted by factional infighting between pragmatists and conservatives. This struggle would lead to economic reform called Đổi Mới beginning in 1986 as Lê Duẩn and his supporters began the effort to open the economy. According to reports, after the Congress Lê Duẩn suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in the Soviet Union. He remained General Secretary until on 10 July 1986 he died of natural causes in Hanoi at age 79. He was temporarily succeeded by Trường Chinh, who himself retired from the post and was replaced by Nguyễn Văn Linh(who had returned to the Politburo in 1985) at the December 6th National Congress. He was buried at Mai Dich Cemetery.

==Personal life==
In 1929, Lê Duẩn married Lê Thị Sương (1910-2008). They had four children from the marriage: daughters (Lê Tuyết Hồng, Lê Thị Cừ, Lê Thị Muội) and son (Lê Hãn).

In 1950, Lê Duẩn remarried to Nguyễn Thụy Nga (1925-2018). They had three children: daughter (Lê Vũ Anh) and sons (Lê Kiên Thành, Lê Kiên Trung).

== Political beliefs ==
Lê Duẩn was a nationalist and during the war he claimed that the &quot;nation and socialism were one&quot;. He stressed the importance of building socialism politically, economically and culturally and of defending the socialist fatherland. Ideologically, he was often referred to as a pragmatist. He often broke with Marxism–Leninism to stress Vietnam&#x27;s uniqueness, most notably in agriculture. Lê Duẩn&#x27;s view of socialism was statist, highly centralised and managerial.

In one of his own works, Lê Duẩn talked about &quot;the right of collective mastery&quot; but in practice opposed it. For instance, party cadres who presented the peasants&#x27; demands for higher prices for their products at the National Congress were criticised by Lê Duẩn. His ideas of collective mastery were hierarchical: &quot;Management by the state aims at ensuring the right of the masses to be the collective masters of the country. How then will the state manage its affairs so as to ensure this right of collective mastery?&quot; His answer to this problem was managerial and statist.

Lê Duẩn&#x27;s concept of &quot;collective mastery&quot; was featured in the 1980 Vietnamese Constitution as was his concept of &quot;collective mastery&quot; of society. The concept was Lê Duẩn&#x27;s version of popular sovereignty that advocated an active role for the people so that they could become their own masters as well as masters of society, nature and the nation. It stated that the people&#x27;s collective mastery in all fields was assured by the state and was implemented by permitting their participation in state affairs and in mass organisations. On paper, the organisations, to which almost all citizens belong, play an active role in government and have the right to introduce bills before the National Assembly.
Lê Duẩn said that land ownership entailed a &quot;struggle between the two roads – collective production and private production; large-scale socialist production and small scattered production.&quot; Since it was believed that collective ownership was the only alternative to capitalism, it was introduced without controversy by the country&#x27;s leadership.

Subcontracting co-operatives to peasants became the norm by the late 1970s and was legalised in 1981. For conservatives, that policy was similar to that of Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy, a temporary break from hardline socialist development. However, those who supported reforms saw subcontracting as another way of implementing socialism in agriculture, which was justified by the ideological tenet of the &quot;three interests&quot;. That was an important ideological innovation and broke with Lê Duẩn&#x27;s &quot;two roads&quot; theory.

Lê Duẩn departed from Marxist–Leninist orthodoxy when it came to practical policy and stated that the country had to &quot;carry out agricultural cooperation immediately, even before having built large industry.&quot; While he acknowledged that his view was heresy, Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation: &quot;It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such as ours. We must lead the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism, without waiting for a developed industry, though we know very well that without the strong impact of industry, agriculture cannot achieve large-scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated... To proceed from small-scale production to large-scale production is a new one.&quot; According to Lê Duẩn, the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation but a new division of labour. He also believed that co-operatives needed to be not autarkic but &quot;organically connected, through the process of production itself, with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector.&quot; Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control. He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined.

In his victory speech after the 1976 parliamentary election, Lê Duẩn talked about perfecting socialism in the North by eliminating private ownership and the last vestiges of capitalism and of the need to initiate socialist transformation in the South where, the party, according to Lê Duẩn, would focus on abolishing the comprador bourgeoisie and the last &quot;remnants of the feudal landlord classes&quot;. &quot;Comprador bourgeoisie&quot; was their term for the bourgeois classes, which made a living by financial dealings and through transactions with Westerners. Lê Duẩn did not reveal that in addition to removing the comprador bourgeoisie and the feudal landlord classes from the South, he intended to obliterate the entire bourgeois class.

<text>Nguyễn Chấn, known as Trần Văn Trà (September 15, 1919 – April 20, 1996) was a colonel-general in the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam. He was Commander of B2 Front during 1963 – 1967, Deputy Commander of Liberation Army of South Vietnam during 1968 – 1972; member of the Central Committee of the Workers&#x27; Party of Vietnam from 1960 to 1982 (3rd and 4th terms).

==Early life==
The son of a bricklayer, Trần Văn Trà was born in Quảng Ngãi Province in 1918. He joined the Indochinese Communist Party in 1938 and spent the years of the Second World War in a French prison. Between 1946 and 1954, Trà fought against the French in the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army and became a general in 1961, commanding communist forces in the southern half of South Vietnam. During the days of The First Indochina War with the French, the Viet Minh recruited more than 600 defeated Japanese soldiers to fight with them.

In June 1946, some of these Japanese followers became instructors in a military school set up by the Viet Minh in Quang Ngai Province, Trà&#x27;s birthplace, to teach fighting skills to more than 400 Vietnamese trainees. It is not known if Trà was one of the organisers or attendees at this military training school. He was Commander of 7th Military Region (1949-1950) and Vice Commander of Cochinchina (1951-1954).

==Vietnam War==
During the Vietnam War against the Americans and South Vietnamese, he led the attack on Saigon during the Tet Offensive of 1968 and commanded the B2 Front during the Easter Offensive.

During a 1974 meeting of North Vietnamese military leaders in Hanoi, Trà argued against a conservative strategy during the coming year and suggested that South Vietnam&#x27;s Phước Long Province be attacked in order to test both South Vietnamese and American military reaction. The attack was successful and the U.S. did not respond militarily, prompting larger, more aggressive communist operations. In April 1975, Trà became Deputy Commander of the A75 headquarters under Senior General Văn Tiến Dũng during the Ho Chi Minh Campaign, the final assault on Saigon which led to the capitulation of the South Vietnamese government. He took charge of Vice-Minister of Defence from 1978 to 1982.

In 1982, Trà published &quot;Vietnam: A History of the Bulwark B-2 Theatre, Volume Concluding the 30-Years War&quot;, which revealed how the Hanoi Politburo had overestimated its own military capabilities and underestimated those of the U.S. and South Vietnam prior to and during the Tet Offensive. This account offended and embarrassed the leaders of the newly unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam and reportedly only one of the five volumes survived. It ultimately led to his purging from the Politburo. From 1989 to 1992 he was Deputy Chairman of the Vietnam Veterans Association. He lived under something similar to a house arrest until his death on April 20, 1996.

<text>Lê Đức Thọ (; 14 October 1911 – 13 October 1990), born Phan Đình Khải in Nam Dinh Province, was a Vietnamese revolutionary general, diplomat, and politician. He was the first Asian to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, jointly with United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1973, but refused the award.

==Communist revolutionary==
Lê Đức Thọ became active in Vietnamese nationalism as a teenager and spent much of his adolescence in French colonial prisons, an experience that hardened him. Thọ&#x27;s nickname was &quot;the Hammer&quot; on account of his severity. In 1930, Lê Đức Thọ helped found the Indochinese Communist Party. French colonial authorities imprisoned him from 1930 to 1936 and again from 1939 to 1944. The French imprisoned him in one of the &quot;tiger cage&quot; cells on the prison located on the island of Poulo Condore (modern Côn Sơn Island) in the South China Sea. Poulo Condore was regarded as the harshest prison in all of French Indochina. During his time in the &quot;tiger cage&quot;, Thọ suffered from hunger, heat, and humiliation. Together with other Vietnamese Communist prisoners, Thọ studied literature, science, and foreign languages and acted in Molière plays. Despite being imprisoned by the French, France was still regarded as the &quot;land of culture&quot;, and the prisoners paid a &quot;peculiar tribute&quot; to French culture by putting on Molière plays.

After his release in 1945, he helped lead the Viet Minh, the Vietnamese independence movement, against the French, until the Geneva Accords were signed in 1954. In 1948, he was in South Vietnam as Deputy Secretary, Head of the Organization Department of Cochinchina Committee Party. He then joined the Lao Dong Politburo of the Vietnam Workers&#x27; Party in 1955, now the Communist Party of Vietnam. Thọ oversaw the Communist insurgency that began in 1956 against the South Vietnamese government. In 1963 Thọ supported the purges of the Party surrounding Resolution 9.

== Peace-making in Paris ==
The United States actively joined the Vietnam War during the early 1960s. Several rounds of Paris Peace Talks (some public, some secret) were held between 1968 and 1973. Xuân Thuỷ was the official head of the North Vietnamese delegation, but Thọ arrived in Paris in June 1968 to take effective control. While Xuân Thuỷ led the official negotiating team representing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the talks in Paris, Thọ and U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger since February 1970 engaged in secret conversations that eventually led to a cease-fire in the Paris Peace Accords of 23 January 1973. On his way to Paris, Thọ stopped in Moscow to meet the Soviet Premier Aleksei Kosygin. On Thọ&#x27;s behalf, Kosygin sent President Lyndon B. Johnson a letter reading: &quot;My colleagues and I believe and have grounds to believe that an end to the bombing [of North Vietnam] would lead to a breakthrough in the peace talks&quot;.

=== 1968 ===
On 26 June 1968, Thọ first met Cyrus Vance and Philip Habib of the American delegation at a &quot;safe house&quot; in the Paris suburb of Sceaux. On 8 September 1968, Thọ first met W. Averell Harriman, the head of the American delegation, in a villa in the town of Vitry-sur-Seine. At the meeting, Harriman conceded that in &quot;serious talks&quot; the National Liberation Front (NLF) might take part in the talks provided that the South Vietnamese were also allowed to join. At another meeting with Harriman on 12 September, Thọ made the concession that South Vietnam could continue as an independent state provided the National Liberation Front could join the government, but demanded that the United States had to unconditionally cease bombing all of the DRV first. After the meeting, Harriman thanked Thọ for his &quot;straight talk&quot;, but disputed a number of Thọ&#x27;s claims, saying that the Vietnam war was not the most costly war in American history. 

Thọ was unhappy when Hanoi demanded that the National Liberation Front take part in the peace talks as the lead negotiating team above the North Vietnamese, which he knew would cause complications. He flew back to Hanoi in an attempt to change the instructions, in which he was successful, but was also told to tell Harriman that an expanded four-party talks involving the Americans, the South Vietnamese, the North Vietnamese and the NLF would begin &quot;as early as possible&quot; without settling a firm date. However, the four party talks did not take place as planned as South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu decided to stall talks after receiving messages from Anna Chennault that the Republican candidate Richard Nixon would be more supportive. On 18 January 1969, Thọ told Harriman that he regretted his departure, saying: &quot;If you had stopped bombing after two or three months of talks, the situation would have been different now&quot;.

=== 1969 ===
In February 1969, Kissinger asked the Soviet ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin, to set up a meeting with Thọ in Paris. On 4 August 1969, Kissinger had a secret meeting at the house of Jean Sainteny, a former French colonial official who served in Vietnam and was sympathetic towards Vietnamese nationalism. However, Thọ did not appear as expected and instead Thuỷ represented the DRV. 

=== 1970 ===
Thọ first met Kissinger in a secret meeting in a modest house in Paris on the night of 21 February 1970, marking the beginning of a test of wills that was to last three years. Kissinger was later to say of Thọ: &quot;I don&#x27;t look back on our meetings with any great joy, yet he was a person of substance and discipline who defended the position he represented with dedication&quot;. Thọ told Kissinger at their first meeting that &quot;Vietnamization&quot; was doomed, dismissively saying in French: &quot;Previously, with over one million U.S and Saigon troops, you have failed. Now how can you win if you let the South Vietnamese Army fight alone and if you only give them military support?&quot;. Kissinger took the fact that Thọ began his activism working for Vietnamese independence at the age of 16 as a proof that he was a &quot;fanatic&quot;, portraying Thọ to Nixon as an unreasonable, uncompromising man, but one was also a well mannered, cultured and polite. Kissinger found Thọ&#x27;s air of superiority exasperating as Thọ took the viewpoint that North Vietnam was the real Vietnam, and regarded the Americans as &quot;barbarians&quot; who were merely trying to delay the inevitable by supporting South Vietnam. In April 1970, Thọ broke off his meetings with Kissinger, saying that there was nothing to discuss. An attempt by Kissinger to talk to Thọ again in May 1970 was rejected with a note reading &quot;The U.S. words of peace are just empty ones&quot;.

=== 1971 ===
By May 1971, Thọ started to change tactics in the talks, insisting that the main issue now was removing President Thiệu after the Americans departed. In July 1971, Kissinger taunted Thọ with the news that President Nixon would be visiting China soon to meet Mao Zedong, telling him that the days when the North Vietnamese could count of the supply of Chinese arms were coming to close. Thọ showed no emotion, saying: &quot;That is your affair. Our fighting is our preoccupation, and that will decide the outcome for our country. What you have told us will have no influence on our fighting&quot;. 

=== 1972 ===
In March 1972, the North Vietnamese launched the Easter Offensive. It was initially successful and led to warnings that the United States would start bombing North Vietnam again. Thọ sent a message, saying if the bombing was resumed, it would be &quot;a very serious step of escalation, aimed at stopping the collapse of the situation in South Vietnam and putting pressure on us&quot;. 

On 2 May 1972, Thọ had his 13th meeting with Kissinger in Paris. The meeting was hostile, as the North Vietnamese had just taken Quang Tri City in South Vietnam, which led Nixon to tell Kissinger &quot;No nonsense. No niceness. No accommodations&quot;. During the meeting, Thọ mentioned that Senator William Fulbright was criticizing the Nixon administration, leading Kissinger to say: &quot;Our domestic discussions are no concern of yours&quot;. Thọ snapped back: &quot;I&#x27;m giving an example to prove that Americans share our views&quot;. When Kissinger asked Thọ why North Vietnam had not responded on a proposal he sent via the Soviet Union, Thọ replied: &quot;We have on many occasions said that if you have any question, you should talk to directly to us, and we shall talk directly to you. We don&#x27;t speak through a third person&quot;.

Thọ next met Kissinger on 19 July 1972. Kissinger asked: &quot;If the United States can accept governments in large that are not pro-American, why should it insist on a pro-U.S government in Saigon?&quot; Thọ stated that Kissinger was not offering anything new. 

By August 1972, Kissinger was promising Thọ that he would pressure Nguyễn Văn Thiệu to resign if only Thọ would agree to make a peace deal before the presidential elections of that year. Thọ told Kissinger that the timetable for Thiệu&#x27;s departure was no longer an immediate concern, and instead he wanted some $8 billion in reparations for the war damage. Kissinger also told Thọ that he wanted to tell the world about their secret meetings since 1970 in order to give the impression that Nixon was making progress on peace in Vietnam, a suggestion that Thọ rejected, saying it was not his job to assist Nixon&#x27;s reelection campaign. 

On 15 September 1972, Kissinger told Thọ: &quot;We wish to end before October 15-if sooner, all the better&quot;. Thọ told Hanoi that Kissinger wanted a peace agreement before the election and now was the best time to settle.

On 7 October 1972, Kissinger and Thọ agreed to a government of national reconciliation in Saigon that was to include the National Liberation Front. Kissinger told Thọ that he expected a peace agreement to be signed in Paris on 25 or 26 October 1972, saying that all was needed now as the approval of Thiệu and Nixon. However, when Kissinger arrived in Saigon, Thiệu refused to sign the peace agreement. Nixon had initially agreed to the peace agreement, but, upon hearing of Thiệu&#x27;s claims of betrayal, started to change his mind. 

On 20 November 1972, Kissinger met Thọ again in Paris. Kissinger no longer aimed at secrecy and was followed by paparazzi as he went to a house owned by the French Communist Party where Thọ was waiting for him. Kissinger announced that the Americans wanted major changes to the peace agreement made in October to accommodate Thiệu, which led Thọ to accuse him of negotiating in bad faith. Thọ stated: &quot;We have been deceived by the French, the Japanese and the Americans. But the deception has never been so flagrant as of now&quot;. Kissinger insisted the changes he wanted were only minor, but in effect he wanted to renegotiate almost the entire agreement. Thọ rejected Kissinger&#x27;s terms, saying he would abide by the terms agreed to on 8 October. Putting more pressure, Nixon told Kissinger to break off the talks if Thọ would not agree to the changes he wanted. Kissinger told Nixon: &quot;While we have a moral case for bombing North Vietnam when it does not accept our terms, it seems to be really stretching the point to bomb North Vietnam when it has accepted our terms and when South Vietnam has not&quot;. By December 1972, the talks had broken, and Nixon decided to resume bombing North Vietnam. 

On 17 December 1972, the Christmas bombings began. On 26 December 1972, North Vietnam announced a willingness to resume peace talks in Paris again in January. Though Nixon had decided after all to accept the peace terms of 8 October, the bombings allowed him to portray himself as having forced North Vietnam to the table. The American historian A.J. Langguth wrote the Christmas bombings were &quot;pointless&quot; as the final peace agreement of 23 January 1973 was essentially the same as that of 8 October 1972 as Thọ refused to make any substantial concessions.

=== 1973 ===
After the Christmas bombings of 1972, Thọ was in particularly savage mood towards Kissinger. The relationship between Kissinger and Thọ was antagonistic and condescending, angering Kissinger. After one meeting, Kissinger asked &quot;Allow me to ask you one question: do you scold your colleagues in the Central Committee the way you scold us?&quot;

At their meeting on 8 January 1973 in a house in the French town of Gif-sur-Yvette, Kissinger arrived to find nobody at the door to greet him. When Kissinger entered the conference room, nobody spoke to him. Sensing the hostile mood, Kissinger speaking in French said: &quot;It was not my fault about the bombing&quot;. Before Kissinger could say anymore, Thọ exploded in rage, saying in French: &quot;Under the pretext of interrupted negotiations, you resumed the bombing of North Vietnam, just at the moment when I reached home. You have &#x27;greeted&#x27; my arrival in a very courteous manner! You action, I can say, is flagrant and gross! You and no one else strained the honor of the United States&quot;. Thọ shouted at Kissinger for over an hour, and despite Kissinger&#x27;s requests not to speak so loudly because the reporters outside the room could hear what he was saying, he did not relent. Thọ concluded: &quot;For more than ten years, America has used violence to beat down the Vietnamese people-napalm, B-52s. But you don&#x27;t draw any lessons from your failures. You continue the same policy. &quot;Ngu xuẩn! Ngu xuẩn! Ngu xuẩn!&quot;&quot; When Kissinger asked what &quot;ngu xuẩn&quot; meant in Vietnamese, the translator refused to translate, as &quot;ngu xuẩn&quot; (in Chữ Nôm: 愚蠢) roughly means that a person is grossly stupid.

When Kissinger was finally able to speak, he argued that it was Thọ who by being unreasonable had forced Nixon to order the Christmas bombings, a claim that led Thọ to snap in fury: &quot;You&#x27;ve spent billions of dollars and many tons of bombs when we had a text ready to sign&quot;. Kissinger replied: &quot;I have heard many adjectives in your comments. I propose that you should not use them&quot;. Thọ answered: &quot;I have used those adjectives with a great deal of restraint already. The world opinion, the U.S. press and U.S. political personalities have used harsher words&quot;.

When the talks finally began, Kissinger put forward the demand that North Vietnam pull out all of its troops out of South Vietnam, a demand that Thọ rejected out of hand. Thọ stated the only issues remaining were the demilitarized zone (DMZ), which he wanted to see abolished under the grounds that all of Vietnam was one country while Kissinger insisted that only civilians be allowed to cross the DMZ that divided the two Vietnams. After much argument, Kissinger agreed to take the issue of the DMZ out of the peace agreement and inserted the phrase &quot;among the questions to be negotiated there is the question of the modalities for civilian movement across the provisional military demarcation line&quot;. 

A paragraph was inserted calling for the withdraw of all foreign forces from South Vietnam, which Kissinger claimed was a commitment from Thọ to pull out North Vietnamese forces. Thọ did not share this view, as he argued that the North Vietnamese troops were not foreign. Thọ told Kissinger that if a peace agreement was signed, that within 15 days a peace agreement would be signed for Laos. But he stated, that unlike the Pathet Lao in Laos, North Vietnam had no influence over the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. Kissinger did not believe Thọ&#x27;s claims that the Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot was a fanatical Khmer nationalist with a hatred of the Vietnamese. After the meeting, Kissinger told Thọ: &quot;We must forget all that has happened. When we walk out, we must be smiling&quot;.

On the night of 9 January 1973, Kissinger phoned Nixon in Washington to say that a peace agreement would be signed very soon. On 10 January 1973, the negotiations broke down when Kissinger demanded the release of all American POWs in North Vietnam once a peace agreement was signed, but offered no guarantees about Viet Cong prisoners being held in South Vietnam. Thọ stated: &quot;I cannot accept your proposal. I completely reject it&quot;. Thọ wanted the release of all prisoners once a peace agreement was signed, which led Kissinger to say this was an unreasonable demand. Thọ, who had been tortured as a young man by the French colonial police for advocating Vietnamese independence, shouted: &quot;You have never been a prisoner. You don&#x27;t understand suffering. It&#x27;s unfair&quot;. Kissinger finally offered that the United States would use &quot;maximum influence&quot; to pressure the South Vietnamese government to release all Viet Cong prisoners within sixty days of a peace agreement being signed. On 23 January 1973, at 12:45 pm, Kissinger and Thọ signed the peace agreement.

The basic facts of the Accords included:

* release of POWs within 80 days;
* ceasefire to be monitored by the International Commission of Control and Supervision (ICC);
* free and democratic elections to be held in South Vietnam;
* U.S. aid to South Vietnam would continue;
* North Vietnamese troops could remain in South Vietnam. 

On 28 March 1973, the last of the American forces left South Vietnam. While 23 January is generally recognized as the enactment date of the Peace Accords, the talks continued out of necessity. Sporadic fighting continued in some regions, while U.S. ground forces were removed by 29 March. Due to continued ceasefire violations by all sides, Kissinger and Thọ met in Paris in May and June 1973 for the purpose of getting the implementation of the peace agreement back on track. On 13 June 1973, the United States and North Vietnam signed a joint communique pledging mutual support for full implementation of the Paris Accords.

== Nobel Peace Prize ==
Thọ and Henry Kissinger were jointly awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in negotiating the Paris Peace Accords. However, Thọ declined to accept the award, claiming that peace had not yet been established, and that the United States and the South Vietnamese governments were in violation of the Paris Peace Accords:


In the interview by the UPI, Thọ also explained for his decision:

==Winning the war==
In January 1974, Thọ told General Hoàng Văn Thái he could not leave to take up a command in South Vietnam as he had expected, saying that the Politburo had assigned Thọ another, more important task. General Thai begged Thọ to let him go win glory on the battlefield, but he was unyielding, saying that turning the Ho Chi Minh Trail into a highway was more important. Using bulldozers from the Soviet Union and China, over the course of 1974, General Thai transformed the Ho Chi Minh Trail into a paved, four lane highway that ran from North Vietnam through Laos and Cambodia into South Vietnam. He also laid down a pipeline to carry oil. The paving of the Ho Chi Minh Trail allowed North Vietnam to not only send more troops to South Vietnam, but to keep them well supplied.

In December 1974, the North Vietnamese launched an offensive in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam that proved more successful than expected and on 6 January 1975 took the provincial capital of Phước Long. Le Duan, the secretary-general of the Vietnamese Workers&#x27; Party, decided to follow up this victory with an offensive to seize all of the Central Highlands and sent Thọ down to monitor operations. Following the Communist victory at the Battle of Ban Me Thuot which ended on 11 March 1975, Thọ approved the plans of the North Vietnamese commander, General Van Tien Dung, to take Pleiku and push further south. Thọ also reported to Hanoi that the South Vietnamese Army were suffering from low morale and fighting poorly, which led him to suggest that all of South Vietnam might be taken that year, instead of 1976 as originally planned. The name of the campaign to take Saigon would be the Ho Chi Minh campaign. The principal problem for the North Vietnamese was that operations had to be completed before the monsoons arrived in June, giving them a very short period of two months to win the war in 1975. Thọ sent Le Duan a poem that began &quot;You warned: Go out and come back in victory...The time of opportunity has arrived&quot;. By April 1975, the North Vietnamese had advanced within striking distance of Saigon with what would prove to be the last major battle of the Vietnam war taking place at Phan Rang between 13 and 16 April 1975.

On 22 April 1975, General Dung showed Thọ his plan to take Saigon, which he approved, saying as he signed off on Dung&#x27;s plan that this was the death sentence for the regime of &quot;reactionary traitors&quot; in Saigon. On 30 April 1975, the North Vietnamese took Saigon and Thọ entered the city in triumph. He immediately set about giving orders to ensure that the water works and electricity grid of Saigon was still functioning; that food would continue to arrive from the countryside; to make arrangements to deal with the one million soldiers of the South Vietnamese Army that he ordered dissolved; and appointing administrators to replace the South Vietnamese officials. On behalf of the Politburo he gave General Dung a telegram from Hanoi that simply read: &quot;Political Bureau is most happy&quot;. On 1 May 1975, a parade was held in Saigon to celebrate both May Day and the victory with Thọ watching the victorious soldiers march down the streets of Saigon, which was soon renamed Ho Chi Minh City.

==Later life==
From 1978 to 1982 Lê Đức Thọ was named by Hanoi to act as chief advisor to the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation (FUNSK) and later to the nascent People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea. Lê Đức Thọ&#x27;s mission was to ensure that Khmer nationalism would not override Vietnam&#x27;s interests in Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge was overthrown.

Lê Đức Thọ served as Permanent Member of the Party Central Committee&#x27;s Secretariat from 1982 to 1986 and later as an Advisor to the Party&#x27;s Central Committee from 1986 until he died in 1990.

== Death ==
Lê Đức Thọ died on 13 October 1990, the evening before his 79th birthday, having reportedly suffered from cancer, in Hanoi.

<text>Damocles is a character who appears in a (likely apocryphal) anecdote commonly referred to as &quot;the sword of Damocles&quot;, an allusion to the imminent and ever-present peril faced by those in positions of power. Damocles was a courtier in the court of Dionysius I of Syracuse, a ruler of Syracuse, Sicily, Magna Graecia, during the classical Greek era.

The anecdote apparently figured in the lost history of Sicily by Timaeus of Tauromenium (). The Roman orator Cicero (), who may have read it in the texts of Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, used it in his &quot;Tusculanae Disputationes&quot;, 5. 61, by which means it passed into the European cultural mainstream.

==Sword of Damocles==
According to the story, Damocles was flattering his king, Dionysius, exclaiming that Dionysius was truly fortunate as a great man of power and authority without peer, surrounded by magnificence. In response, Dionysius offered to switch places with Damocles for one day so that Damocles could taste that fortune firsthand. Damocles eagerly accepted the king&#x27;s proposal. Damocles sat on the king&#x27;s throne amid embroidered rugs, fragrant perfumes, and the service of beautiful attendants. But Dionysius, who had made many enemies during his reign, arranged that a sword should hang above the throne, held at the pommel only by a single hair of a horse&#x27;s tail to evoke the sense of what it is like to be king: though having much fortune, always having to watch in anxiety against dangers that might try to overtake him, whether it is a jealous advisor or servant, a slanderous rumor, an enemy kingdom, a poor royal decision, or anything else. Damocles finally begged the king for permission to depart because he no longer wanted to be so fortunate, realizing that while he had everything he could ever want at his feet, it could not affect what was above his crown.

King Dionysius effectively conveyed the constant fear in which a person with great power may live. Dionysius committed many cruelties in his rise to power, such that he could never go on to rule justly because that would make him vulnerable to his enemies. Cicero used this story as the last in a series of contrasting examples for concluding his fifth &quot;Disputation&quot;, in which the theme is that having virtue is sufficient for living a happy life.

== Differing interpretations ==
Cicero&#x27;s meaning in the story of the Sword of Damocles has alternative interpretations. Cicero states, &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Dionysius seem to have made it plenty clear that nothing is happy for him over whom terror always looms?&quot; arguing that those in positions of power can never rest and truly enjoy that power. Some take this and argue further, stating that the point was that death looms over all, but that it is vital to strive to be happy and enjoy life in spite of that terror. Others take the meaning to be something akin to &quot;don&#x27;t judge someone until you&#x27;ve walked a mile in their shoes,&quot; as it is impossible to know what someone is struggling with, even if their life seems to be perfect to the outside observer. Just as King Dionysius&#x27;s life looked luxurious and flawless on the outside to Damocles, so too might the lives of others that one covets for oneself. One other interpretation sees the story of the sword of Damocles as explicitly meant for Julius Caesar, implicitly suggesting that he should take care not to act the same way that King Dionysius did, making enemies and denying spiritual life, falling prey to the pitfalls of the tyrant, and mind the sword hanging ever-present over his neck.

==Use in culture, art, and literature==
The sword of Damocles is frequently used in allusion to this tale, epitomizing the imminent and ever-present peril faced by those in positions of power. More generally, it is used to denote the sense of foreboding engendered by a precarious situation, especially one in which the onset of tragedy is restrained only by a delicate trigger or chance. William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot; expands on this theme: &quot;Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown&quot;; compare the Hellenistic and Roman imagery connected with the insecurity offered by Tyche and Fortuna.

In &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, Geoffrey Chaucer refers to the sword of Damocles, which the Knight describes as hanging over Conquest. When the Knight describes the three temples, he also pays special attention to the paintings, noticing one on the walls of the temple of Mars:
The Roman 1st-century BC poet Horace also alluded to the sword of Damocles in Ode 1 of the &quot;Third Book of Odes&quot;, in which he extolled the virtues of living a simple, rustic life, favoring such an existence over the myriad threats and anxieties that accompany holding a position of power. In this appeal to his friend and patron, the aristocratic Gaius Maecenas, Horace describes the &quot;Siculae dapes&quot; or &quot;Sicilian feasts&quot; as providing no savory pleasure to the man, &quot;above whose impious head hangs a drawn sword (&quot;destrictus ensis&quot;).&quot;
The phrase has also come to be used in describing any situation infused with a sense of impending doom, especially when the peril is visible and proximal—regardless of whether the victim is in a position of power. United States President John F. Kennedy compared the omnipresent threat of nuclear annihilation to a sword of Damocles hanging over the people of the world. Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev wanted the Tsar Bomba to &quot;hang like the sword of Damocles over the imperialists&#x27; heads&quot;.

Woodcut images of the sword of Damocles as an emblem appear in 16th- and 17th-century European books of devices, with moralizing couplets or quatrains, with the import . A small vignette shows Damocles under a canopy of state, at the festive table, with Dionysius seated nearby; the etching, with its clear political moral, was later used to illustrate the idea.

References to the sword of Damocles can also be found in cartoonist illustrations, such as in Joseph Keppler&#x27;s magazine &quot;Puck&quot;, a satiric periodical started in the late 1800s in the United States, and the sword can be used as a device to call attention to the peril that current events or contentious issues of the time place the world in.

The sword of Damocles frequently appears in popular culture, including novels, feature films, television series, video games, and music. Some notable examples include &quot;Damocles&quot;, a 16-bit videogame from 1990 in which the player races to prevent the titular comet Damocles from destroying a planet, the song &quot;The Sword of Damocles&quot; from &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, and a virtual reality headset also called The Sword of Damocles, developed by Ivan Sutherland in 1968, named for its suspension from the ceiling of the lab in which it was developed and its foreboding appearance.

In &quot;Made in Canada&quot;, a Canadian television series that ran from 1998 to 2003, &quot;Sword of Damacles&quot; was the name of an in-series television show produced by Pyramid, the production company the show centres around.

The &quot;Damocles&quot; is the name of the ship that is used in a multi-episode plot-line that spanned multiple seasons of the television show NCIS.

The CW show &quot;The 100&quot; presents its two-part finale of season 5, titled &quot;Damocles.&quot; In this finale, General Diyoza confronts Octavia with the words, &quot;Do you know what your mistake was? Your mistake was enjoying it... Power... it’s the kiss of death.&quot; 

The American band Trivium released a song called &quot;Like a Sword Over Damocles&quot; on their 2021 album &quot;In the Court of the Dragon&quot;.

The sword of Damocles is an oft-used symbol in modern hip hop, an allusion used to impart the threat &quot;kingly&quot; rappers face of being deposed as the best of the best. It is referenced in the lyrics of the song &quot;Zealots&quot; by The Fugees in 1996. It also appears in the music of Kanye West, both in the music video for his single &quot;Power&quot; in 2010, where a sword is positioned above West&#x27;s head as he stands amidst rows of Ionic columns, and in later cover art for the song, which features the impaled head of a black man wearing a crown.

<text>Vandana Shiva (born 5 November 1952) is an Indian scholar, environmental activist, food sovereignty advocate, ecofeminist and anti-globalization author. Based in Delhi, Shiva has written more than 20 books. She is often referred to as &quot;Gandhi of grain&quot; for her activism associated with the anti-GMO movement.

Shiva is one of the leaders and board members of the International Forum on Globalization (with Jerry Mander, Ralph Nader, and Helena Norberg-Hodge), and a figure of the anti-globalisation movement. She has argued in favour of many traditional practices, as in her interview in the book &quot;Vedic Ecology&quot; (by Ranchor Prime). She is a member of the scientific committee of the Fundacion IDEAS, Spain&#x27;s Socialist Party&#x27;s think tank. She is also a member of the International Organization for a Participatory Society.

==Early life and education==
Vandana Shiva was born in Dehradun. Her father was a conservator of forests, and her mother was a farmer with a love for nature. She was educated at St. Mary&#x27;s Convent High School, Nainital, and at the Convent of Jesus and Mary, Dehradun.

Shiva studied physics at Punjab University in Chandigarh, graduating as a Bachelor of Science in 1972. After a brief stint at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, she moved to Canada to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in the philosophy of science at the University of Guelph in 1977 where she wrote a thesis entitled &quot;Changes in the concept of periodicity of light&quot;. In 1978, she completed and received her PhD in philosophy at the University of Western Ontario, focusing on philosophy of physics. Her dissertation was titled &quot;Hidden variables and locality in quantum theory&quot; in which she discussed the mathematical and philosophical implications of hidden variable theories that fall outside of the purview of Bell&#x27;s theorem. She later went on to pursue interdisciplinary research in science, technology, and environmental policy at the Indian Institute of Science and the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore.

==Career==
Vandana Shiva has written and spoken extensively about advances in the fields of agriculture and food. Intellectual property rights, biodiversity, biotechnology, bioethics, and genetic engineering are among the fields where Shiva has fought through activist campaigns. She has assisted grassroots organisations of the Green movement in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria with opposition to advances in agricultural development via genetic engineering.

In 1982, she founded the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology. This led to the creation of Navdanya in 1991, a national movement to protect the diversity and integrity of living resources, especially native seed, the promotion of organic farming and fair trade. Navdanya, which translates to &quot;Nine Seeds&quot; or &quot;New Gift&quot;, is an initiative of the RFSTE to educate farmers of the benefits of maintaining diverse and individualised crops rather than accepting offers from monoculture food producers. The initiative established over 40 seed banks across India to provide regional opportunity for diverse agriculture. In 2004 Shiva started Bija Vidyapeeth, an international college for sustainable living in Doon Valley, Uttarakhand, in collaboration with Schumacher College, UK.

In the area of intellectual property rights and biodiversity, Shiva and her team at the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology challenged the biopiracy of neem, basmati and wheat. 

In 1990, she wrote a report for the FAO on Women and Agriculture titled &quot;Most Farmers in India are Women&quot;. She founded the gender unit at the International Centre for Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Kathmandu and was a founding board member of the Women&#x27;s Environment &amp; Development Organisation (WEDO).
She received the Right Livelihood Award in 1993, an award established by Swedish-German philanthropist Jakob von Uexkull.

Shiva&#x27;s book &quot;Making Peace With the Earth&quot; discusses biodiversity and the relationship between communities and nature. &quot;Accordingly, she aligns the destruction of natural biodiversity with the dismantling of traditional communities—those who &#x27;understand the language of nature&#x27;&quot;. David Wright wrote in a review of the book that to Shiva, &quot;the Village becomes a symbol, almost a metaphor for &#x27;the local&#x27; in all nations&quot;.

Shiva has also served as an advisor to governments in India and abroad as well as non-governmental organisations, including the International Forum on Globalization, the Women&#x27;s Environment &amp; Development Organisation and the Third World Network. She chairs the Commission on the Future of Food set up by the Region of Tuscany in Italy and is a member of the Scientific Committee that advised former prime minister Zapatero of Spain. Shiva is a member of the Steering Committee of the Indian People&#x27;s Campaign Against WTO. She is a councilor of the World Future Council. Shiva serves on Government of India Committees on Organic Farming. She participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2007.

In 2021, she advised the government of Sri Lanka to ban inorganic fertilizers and pesticides stating &quot;This decision will definitely help farmers become more prosperous. Use of organic fertilizer will help provide agri products rich with nutrients while retaining the fertility of the land.&quot; The policy applied overnight, with the main purpose to save State foreign exchange bills on imported fertilizers, caused a crisis with a significant reduction of farming output in several sectors, hitting the tea industry in particular and reducing rice yields were by one third. The ban was overturned seven months later.

== Activism ==
Her work on agriculture started in 1984 after the violence in Punjab and the Bhopal disaster caused by a gas leak from Union Carbide&#x27;s pesticide manufacturing plant. Her studies for the UN University led to the publication of her book &quot;The Violence of the Green Revolution&quot;.

In an interview with David Barsamian, Shiva argues that the seed-chemical package promoted by green revolution agriculture has depleted fertile soil and destroyed living ecosystems. In her work Shiva cites data allegedly demonstrating that today there are over 1400 pesticides that may enter the food system across the world.

Shiva is a founding councillor of the World Future Council (WFC). The WFC was formed in 2007 &quot;to speak on behalf of policy solutions that serve the interests of future generations.&quot; Their primary focus has been on climate security.

She supports the crime of ecocide being introduced to the International Criminal Court stating &quot;&quot;The ideal of limitless growth is leading to limitless violations of the rights of the Earth and of the rights of nature. This is ecocide&quot;.&quot;

===Seed freedom===
Vandana supports the idea of seed freedom, or the rejection of patents on new plant lines or cultivars. She has campaigned against the implementation of the WTO 1994 Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, which broadens the scope of patents to include life forms. Shiva has criticised the agreement as having close ties with the corporate sector and opening the door to further patents on life. Shiva calls the patenting of life &#x27;biopiracy&#x27;, and has fought against attempted patents of several indigenous plants, such as basmati. In 2005, Shiva&#x27;s was one of the three organisations that won a 10-year battle in the European Patent Office against the biopiracy of Neem by the US Department of Agriculture and the corporation WR Grace. In 1998, Shiva&#x27;s organisation Navdanya began a campaign against the biopiracy of basmati rice by US corporation RiceTec Inc. In 2001, following intensive campaigning, RiceTec lost most of its claims to the patent.

===Golden rice===
Shiva strongly opposes golden rice, a breed of rice that has been genetically engineered to biosynthesise beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A. Shiva contends that Golden Rice is more harmful than beneficial in her explanation of what she calls the &quot;Golden Rice hoax&quot;: &quot;Unfortunately, Vitamin A rice is a hoax, and will bring further dispute to plant genetic engineering where public relations exercises seem to have replaced science in promotion of untested, unproven and unnecessary technology... This is a recipe for creating hunger and malnutrition, not solving it.&quot; Adrian Dubock says that golden rice is as cheap as other rice and vitamin A deficiency is the greatest reason for blindness and causes 28% of global preschool child mortality. Shiva has claimed that the women of Bengal grow and eat 150 greens which can do the same, while environmental consultant Patrick Moore suggests that most of these 250 million children do not eat much else than a bowl of rice a day. In the 2013 report &quot;The economic power of the Golden Rice opposition&quot;, two economists, Wesseler and Zilberman from Munich University and the University of California, Berkeley respectively calculated that the absence of Golden Rice in India had caused the loss of over 1.4 million lives in the previous ten years.

===GM, India and suicides===

According to Shiva, &quot;Soaring seed prices in India have resulted in many farmers being mired in debt and turning to suicide&quot;. The creation of seed monopolies, the destruction of alternatives, the collection of superprofits in the form of royalties, and the increasing vulnerability of monocultures has created a context for debt, suicides, and agrarian distress. According to data from the Indian government, nearly 75 percent of rural debt is due to purchased inputs. Shiva claims that farmers&#x27; debt grows as GMO corporation&#x27;s profits grow. According to Shiva, it is in this systemic sense that GM seeds are those of suicide.

International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) twice analysed academic articles and government data and concluded the decrease and that there was no evidence on &quot;resurgence&quot; of farmer suicide.

==Ecofeminism==
Shiva plays a major role in the global ecofeminist movement. According to her 2004 article &quot;Empowering Women,&quot; a more sustainable and productive approach to agriculture can be achieved by reinstating the system of farming in India that is more centred on engaging women. She advocates against the prevalent &quot;patriarchal logic of exclusion,&quot; claiming that a woman-focused system would be a great improvement. She believes that ecological destruction and industrial catastrophes threaten daily life, and the maintenance of these problems have become women&#x27;s responsibility.

Cecile Jackson has criticised some of Shiva&#x27;s views as essentialist.

Shiva co-wrote the book &quot;Ecofeminism&quot; in 1993 with &quot;German anarchist and radical feminist sociologist&quot; Maria Mies. It combined Western and Southern feminism with &quot;environmental, technological and feminist issues, all incorporated under the term ecofeminism&quot;. These theories are combined throughout the book in essays by Shiva and Mies.

Stefanie Lay described the book as a collection of thought-provoking essays but also found in it a lack of new ecofeminist theories and contemporary analysis, as well as &quot;overall failure to acknowledge the work of others&quot;.

==Indian Intelligence Bureau investigation==
In June 2014, Indian and international media reported that Navdanya and Vandana Shiva were named in a leaked, classified report by India&#x27;s Intelligence Bureau (IB), which was prepared for the Indian Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.

The leaked report says that campaigning activities of Indian NGOs such as Navdanya are hampering India&#x27;s growth and development. In its report, the IB said that Indian NGOs, including Navdanya, receive money from foreign donors under the &#x27;charitable garb&#x27; of campaigning for human rights or women&#x27;s equality, but instead use the money for &quot;&#x27;nefarious purposes&quot;&#x27;. &quot;These foreign donors lead local NGOs to provide field reports which are used to build a record against India and serve as tools for the strategic foreign policy interests of the Western governments,&quot; the IB report states.

==Criticism==
Investigative journalist Michael Specter, in an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on 25 August 2014 called &quot;Seeds of Doubt&quot;, raised concerns over a number of Shiva&#x27;s claims regarding GMOs and some of her campaigning methods. He wrote: &quot;Shiva&#x27;s absolutism about G.M.O.s can lead her in strange directions. In 1999, ten thousand people were killed and millions were left homeless when a cyclone hit India&#x27;s eastern coastal state of Orissa. When the U.S. government dispatched grain and soy to help feed the desperate victims, Shiva held a news conference in New Delhi and said that the donation was proof that &#x27;the United States has been using the Orissa victims as guinea pigs&#x27; for genetically-engineered products, although she made no mention that those same products are approved and consumed in the United States. She also wrote to the international relief agency Oxfam to say that she hoped it wasn&#x27;t planning to send genetically modified foods to feed the starving survivors.&quot;

Shiva responded that Specter was &quot;ill informed&quot; and that &quot;for the record, ever since I sued Monsanto in 1999 for its illegal Bt cotton trials in India, I have received death threats&quot;, adding that the &quot;concerted PR assault on me for the last two years from Lynas, Specter and an equally vocal Twitter group is a sign that the global outrage against the control over our seed and food, by Monsanto through GMOs, is making the biotech industry panic.&quot; David Remnick, the editor of the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, responded by publishing a letter supporting Specter&#x27;s article.

Cases of plagiarism have been pointed out against Shiva. Birendra Nayak noted that Shiva copied verbatim from a 1996 article in Voice Gopalpur in her 1998 book &quot;Stronger than Steel&quot;, and that in 2016, she plagiarised several paragraphs of an article by S Faizi on the Plachimada/Coca-Cola issue published in &quot;The Statesman&quot;.

Journalist Keith Kloor, in an article published in &quot;Discover&quot; on 23 October 2014 titled &quot;The Rich Allure of a Peasant Champion&quot;, revealed that Shiva charges $40,000 per lecture, plus a business-class air ticket from New Delhi. Kloor wrote: &quot;She is often heralded as a tireless &#x27;defender of the poor,&#x27; someone who has courageously taken her stand among the peasant farmers of India. Let it be noted, however, that this champion of the downtrodden doesn&#x27;t exactly live a peasant&#x27;s lifestyle.&quot;

Stewart Brand in Whole Earth Discipline described some of Shiva&#x27;s statements as pseudo-scientific, calling her warnings about &quot;heritable sterility&quot; (&quot;Stolen Harvest&quot;, 2000) a &quot;biological impossibility&quot; but also plagiarism from Geri Guidetti, owner of the seed supplier company Ark Institute, and a &quot;distraction&quot; created by inflating the potential of terminator genes based on a single 1998 patent granted to a US company. Brand also criticised the position of anti-GMO activists, including Shiva, who forced Zambia&#x27;s government to reject internationally donated corn in 2001-02 because it was &quot;poisoned&quot;, as well as during the cyclone disaster in India. On the latter Shiva argued, &quot;emergency cannot be used as market opportunity&quot;, to which Brand responded, &quot;anyone who encourages other people to starve on principle should do some of the starving themselves&quot;. In 1998 Shiva was also protesting against Bt cotton program in India, calling it &quot;seeds of suicide, seeds of slavery, seeds of despair&quot;, claiming she was protecting the farmers. Restrictive laws established in India under anti-GMO lobbying, however, led to widespread grassroots &quot;seed piracy&quot; where Indian farmers illegally planted seeds of Bt cotton and Bt brinjal, obtained either from experimental plantations or from Bangladesh (where they are planted legally) due to increased yield and reduced pesticide usage. As of 2005 over 2.5 million hectares were planted with &quot;unofficial&quot; Bt cotton in India, of which Noel Kingsbury said:

In India, farmers planting GM crops illegally eventually formed the Shetkari Sanghatana movement, calling for reform of the restrictive laws created under anti-GMO lobbying and as of 2020 an estimated 25% of cotton farmed is GM.

==Science as legacy of exploitation==
Shiva has repeatedly gone on record characterizing science as &quot;a very narrow, patriarchal project&quot; that has been around only &quot;for a short period of history&quot; and argued that &quot;we name &#x27;science&#x27; what is mechanistic and reductionist.&quot; She condemns the &quot;kind of science&quot; that &quot;Bacon, Descartes, and others, who are called &#x27;fathers of modern science&#x27;, have created,&quot; because scientists, as she claims, &quot;declare nature as dead&quot; and then use a &quot;mechanistic mode&quot; to analyze it. Shiva assigns the so-called scientific progress of the last centuries to the advance of capitalism, a time when the new exploitation needed a knowledge that would justify it. In her 8 March 2017 speech to the European Parliament, Shiva stated that the &quot;rise of masculinist science with Descartes, Newton, Bacon, led to the domination of [a] reductionist mechanistic science and a subjugation of [the] knowledge systems [that are] based on interconnections and relationships,&quot; a knowledge, she argued, that &quot;includes all indigenous knowledge systems, and women’s knowledge.&quot;

==Film==
Vandana Shiva has been interviewed for a number of documentary films including &quot;Freedom Ahead&quot;, &quot;Roshni;&quot; &quot;Deconstructing Supper: Is Your Food Safe?,&quot; &quot;The Corporation,&quot; &quot;Thrive,&quot; &quot;Dirt! The Movie,&quot; Normal is Over, and &quot;This is What Democracy Looks Like&quot; (a documentary about the Seattle WTO protests of 1999). and Michael Moore and Jeff Gibbs &quot;Planet of the Humans&quot;.

Shiva&#x27;s focus on water has caused her to appear in a number of films on this topic. These films include &quot;Ganga From the Ground Up,&quot; a documentary on water issues in the river Ganges; &quot;Blue Gold: World Water Wars&quot; by Sam Bozzo; Irena Salina&#x27;s documentary &quot;&quot; (in competition at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival), and the PBS NOW documentary &quot;On Thin Ice.&quot;

On the topic of genetically modified crops, she was featured in the documentary &quot;Fed Up!&quot; (2002), on genetic engineering, industrial agriculture and sustainable alternatives; and the documentary &quot;The World According to Monsanto&quot;, a film made by the French independent journalist Marie-Monique Robin.

Shiva appeared in a documentary film about the Dalai Lama, entitled &quot;Dalai Lama Renaissance&quot;.

In 2010, Shiva was interviewed in a documentary about honeybees and colony collapse disorder, entitled &quot;Queen of the Sun&quot;.

She appears in the French films &quot;Demain&quot; and &quot;Solutions locales pour un désordre global&quot;.

In 2016, she appeared in the vegan documentary film &quot;H.O.P.E.: What You Eat Matters&quot;, where she was critical of the animal agriculture industry and meat-intensive diets.

<text>Dactyl ( ; formally (243) Ida I Dactyl) is a small asteroid moon , in size) that orbits 243 Ida, a main-belt asteroid. It was imaged by the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft on August 28, 1993; Dactyl was discovered while examining the delayed image downloads from Galileo on February 17, 1994. It was provisionally designated S/1993 (243) 1. The satellite was named after the mythical creatures called dactyls, who, according to Greek mythology, lived on Mount Ida.

== Orbit ==

Dactyl&#x27;s orbit around Ida is not precisely known. &quot;Galileo&quot; was in the plane of Dactyl&#x27;s orbit when most of the images were taken, which made determining its exact orbit difficult. Dactyl orbits in the prograde direction and is inclined about 8° to Ida&#x27;s equator. Based on computer simulations, Dactyl&#x27;s pericenter must be more than about from Ida for it to remain in a stable orbit. The range of orbits generated by the simulations was narrowed down by the necessity of having the orbits pass through points at which &quot;Galileo&quot; observed Dactyl to be at 16:52:05 UT on 28 August 1993, about from Ida at longitude 85°. On 26 April 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope observed Ida for eight hours and was unable to spot Dactyl. It would have been able to observe it if it were more than about from Ida.

If in a circular orbit at the distance at which it was seen, Dactyl&#x27;s orbital period would be about 20 hours. Its orbital speed is roughly , &quot;about the speed of a fast run or a slowly thrown baseball&quot;.

== Origin ==
The origins of Dactyl are unclear, but two main hypotheses exist. The first is that Dactyl and Ida formed at the same time, and the second is that Dactyl was knocked loose by a later impact.

Dactyl was the first asteroid moon discovered. Its discovery settled the long debate over the existence of asteroid moons.

<text>Phạm Văn Đồng (; 1 March 1906 – 29 April 2000) was a Vietnamese politician who served as Prime Minister of North Vietnam from 1955 to 1976. He later served as Prime Minister of Vietnam, following reunification of North and South Vietnam, from 1976 until he retired in 1987 under the presidency of Lê Duẩn and Nguyễn Văn Linh. He was considered one of Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s closest lieutenants.

Pham Van Dong is the longest serving Prime Minister of Vietnam, over 30 years from 1955 to 1987 and a student and close associate of Ho Chi Minh. His nickname is To, this used to be his alias. He was also called Lam Ba Kiet when he worked as Deputy Director of the District Attorney&#x27;s Office in Guilin (the director was Ho Hoc Lam).

==Early life==
According to an official report, Dong was born into a family of civil servants in Đức Tân village, Mộ Đức district, in Quảng Ngãi Province on the central coast on 1 March 1906. In 1925, at the age of 18, he joined fellow students to stage a school sit-in to mourn the death of the famous patriotic scholar Phan Chu Trinh. 

About this time he developed an interest in the Communist Party and in the unification and decolonization of Vietnam. In 1926, he traveled to Guangzhou in southern China to attend a training course run by Nguyen Ai Quoc (later known as Ho Chi Minh), before being admitted as a member of the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League, or Thanh Niên for short, the predecessor of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV).

In 1929, he worked for Thanh Niên in Saigon. In the same year, he was arrested, tried by the French colonial authorities and sentenced to ten years in prison. He served the term in Poulo Condor Island Prison until 1936, when he was released under the general amnesty granted by the government of the Popular Front in France after its recent electoral successes.

==Revolutionary and Party career==
In 1936, he was released from prison and began operating in Hanoi. In 1940, he secretly went to China with Võ Nguyên Giáp, joined the Indochinese Communist Party, and was tasked by Ho Chi Minh to build a base at the Vietnam-China border.

Phạm Văn Đồng joined the Indochinese Communist Party in 1940 and then continued to take part in activities led by Ho Chi Minh. In 1945, at the National People&#x27;s Congress of Tân Trào, he was elected to the Standing Committee of five members of the National Committee for the Liberation, preparing for the August Revolution.

After Ho Chi Minh rose to power during the August Revolution in 1945, Phạm Văn Đồng was appointed minister of finance of the newly established government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV), a position he occupied until 1946. 

Before he assumed the position of Minister of Finance, on May 31, 1946, he was the head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at Fontainebleau (France) instead of Nguyễn Tường Tam, who did not undertake the task, seeking an independent solution for Indochina. However, the conference failed because France did not set a definite deadline for the referendum in Cochinchina.

In 1947 he was elected as alternate member of the Central Committee of Indochinese Communist Party (official commissioner since 1949). From July 1949, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister.

In September 1954, Phạm Văn Đồng became Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Head of Foreign Affairs of the Central Committee of the Party. At the 5th session of the DRV&#x27;s First National Assembly convocation (1955), Dong was appointed the Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Vice President of the National Defense Council until his retirement in 1987. He was a member of the National Assembly from 1946 to 1987.

==First Indochina War==
Following the defeat of Japan, nationalist forces fought French colonial forces in the First Indochina War that lasted from 1945 to 1954. Phạm Văn Đồng was appointed as the Special Envoy of the Central Committee in South Central Vietnam. 

After the French suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 peace talks began. In May 1954, Phạm Văn Đồng was appointed Head of the Government delegation to the Geneva Conference on Indochina. After intense negotiations a peace treaty was signed and the French forces withdrew from direct conflict with the newly independent North Vietnam, while providing for what was originally envisioned as the temporary division of North and South Vietnam, and recognizing the independence of Cambodia and Laos. He signed the peace accords with French Premier Pierre Mendès France.

== Second Indochinese War ==
Ho Chi Minh had suffered several strokes in the early 1960s, causing him to largely retire from the day-to-day management of North Vietnam. Owing to Ho&#x27;s absence, Đồng became the face of North Vietnam during the war with the United States, as he was the one who usually spoke to foreign diplomats and journalists. He was known to have close links with the Chinese government, which helped fund the conflict with South Vietnam and economic development of North Vietnam. He was also one of the figures involved in peace talks to end the conflict under the administrations of Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon.

In 1963, Đồng played a part in the &quot;Maneli affair&quot;, named after Mieczysław Maneli, the Polish commissioner to the International Control Commission. In May 1963 Đồng told Maneli he was interested in his peace plan calling for a federation of the two Vietnams, saying that just as long as the American advisers left South Vietnam &quot;we can come to an agreement with any Vietnamese&quot;. Reflecting the problems imposed by the drought in North Vietnam, Đồng told Maneli that he was willing to accept a ceasefire which would be followed up by a barter trade with coal from North Vietnam being exchanged for rice from South Vietnam. That proposal ultimately went nowhere in the face of resistance from both the government of South Vietnam and the United States and opposition by North Vietnam&#x27;s allies.

In 1964–65, Đồng was involved in the so-called &quot;Seaborn Mission&quot;, meeting with the diplomat J. Blair Seaborn, who served as the Canadian Commissioner to the International Control Commission. On 8 June 1964, Đồng met Seaborn in Hanoi. Seaborn had an offer from President Johnson promising billions of American economic aid and diplomatic recognition of North Vietnam in exchange for North Vietnam ending its attempts to overthrow the government of South Vietnam. Seaborn also warned that Johnson had told him that he was considering a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam if his offer was rejected. Đồng told Seaborn that the American terms were unacceptable, as he demanded the end of American assistance to South Vietnam; South Vietnam to become neutral in the Cold War; and for the National Liberation Front, better known as the Viet Cong, to take part in a coalition government in Saigon.

==Later life==
In general, Phạm Văn Đồng was considered a staunch communist and a great nationalist leader, one of the most faithful disciples of Ho Chi Minh and a major figure in Vietnam&#x27;s fight for independence and unity. He tried to maintain a neutral position in the various conflicts within the party, particularly after the establishment of the Vietnamese Socialist Republic in 1976.

From 12 to 17 October 1978 Dong visited Malaysia. Here he pledged Vietnam would not interfere in the internal affairs of other nations and laid a wreath at the National Monument.

Although retired from public office, he served as a Counselor to the Party Central Committee from December 1986 to 1997. He often urged the party to make greater efforts to stop corruption, which is still a widespread problem in Vietnam today. He gave advice on similar issues, even after his term as an adviser to the Central Committee had ended.

As he became older, his vision deteriorated, and he was blind for the last 10 years of his life. After several months of illness, he died in Hanoi on 29 April 2000, at the age of 94. His death was announced by the Vietnamese Communist Party and the Vietnamese government three days later on 2 May. Commemoration and funeral services were held on 6 May 2000, in Hanoi.

<text>The Riot Act (1 Geo. 1. St. 2. c. 5), sometimes called the Riot Act 1714 or the Riot Act 1715, was an act of the Parliament of Great Britain which authorised local authorities to declare any group of 12 or more people to be unlawfully assembled and order them to disperse or face punitive action. The act&#x27;s full title was &quot;An Act for preventing tumults and riotous assemblies, and for the more speedy and effectual punishing the rioters&quot;, and it came into force on 1 August 1715. It was repealed in England and Wales by section 10(2) and Part III of Schedule 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967. Acts similar to the Riot Act passed into the laws of British colonies in Australia and North America, some of which remain in force today.

The phrase &quot;&quot; has passed into common usage for a stern reprimand or warning of consequences.

==Introduction and purpose==
The Riot Act 1714 was introduced during a time of civil disturbance in Great Britain, including the Sacheverell riots of 1710, the Coronation riots of 1714 and the 1715 riots in England. The preamble makes reference to &quot;many rebellious riots and tumults [that] have been [taking place of late] in diverse parts of this kingdom&quot;, adding that those involved &quot;presum[e] so to do, for that the punishments provided by the laws now in being are not adequate to such heinous offences&quot;.

==Main provisions==
===Proclamation of riotous assembly===
The act created a mechanism for certain local officials to make a proclamation ordering the dispersal of any group of twelve or more people who were &quot;unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously assembled together&quot;. If the group failed to disperse within one hour, then anyone remaining gathered was guilty of a felony without benefit of clergy, punishable by death.

The proclamation could be made in an incorporated town or city by the mayor, bailiff or &quot;other head officer&quot;, or a justice of the peace. Elsewhere it could be made by a justice of the peace or the sheriff, undersheriff or parish constable. It had to be read out to the gathering concerned and had to follow precise wording detailed in the act; several convictions were overturned because parts of the proclamation had been omitted, in particular &quot;God save the King&quot;.

The wording that had to be read out to the assembled gathering was as follows:

In a number of jurisdictions, such as Britain, Canada and New Zealand, wording such as this was enshrined and codified in the law itself. While the expression &quot;reading the Riot Act&quot; is cemented in common idiom with its figurative usage, it originated fairly and squarely in statute itself. In New Zealand&#x27;s Crimes Act 1961, section 88, repealed since 1987, was specifically given the heading of &quot;Reading the Riot Act&quot;.

===Consequences of disregarding the proclamation===
If a group of people failed to disperse within one hour of the proclamation, the act provided that the authorities could use force to disperse them. Anyone assisting with the dispersal was specifically indemnified against any legal consequences in the event of any of the crowd being injured or killed.

Because of the broad authority that the act granted, it was used both for the maintenance of civil order and for political means. A particularly notorious use of the act was the Peterloo Massacre of 1819 in Manchester.

===Other provisions===
The act also made it a felony punishable by death without benefit of clergy for &quot;any persons unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled together&quot; to cause (or begin to cause) serious damage to places of religious worship, houses, barns, and stables.

In the event of buildings being damaged in areas that were not incorporated into a town or city, the residents of the hundred were made liable to pay damages to the property owners concerned. Unlike the rest of the act, this required a civil action. In the case of incorporated areas, the action could be brought against two or more named individuals. This provision encouraged residents to attempt to quell riots in order to avoid paying damages.

Prosecutions under the act were restricted to within one year of the event.

==Controversies==

===Impracticality===
At times, it was unclear to both rioters and authorities as to whether the reading of the Riot Act had occurred. One example of this is evident in the massacre of St George&#x27;s Fields of 1768. At the trials following the incident, there was confusion among witnesses as to when the Riot Act had actually been read.

===Use of force===
In the 1768 massacre of St George&#x27;s Fields, large numbers of subjects gathered outside King&#x27;s Bench Prison in Southwark, south London, to protest against the incarceration of John Wilkes. Officials feared that the crowd would forcibly release Wilkes, and troops arrived to guard the prison. After some time, as well as provocation by the rioters, the troops opened fire on the crowd. There were several fatalities, including non-participants of the riot who were struck by stray bullets. Some scholars believe that this massacre set the legal precedent for the justified use of force in future riots.

The provision pertaining to the use of force can be found in section 3 of the Riot Act:

There was also confusion regarding the use of troops as it pertained to the one-hour mark. Rioters often believed that the military could not use force until one hour had passed since the reading of the proclamation. This is evident in the actions of the rioters at the massacre of St George&#x27;s Fields, particularly their provocative behaviour towards the soldiers.

==Subsequent history of the Riot Act in the UK and colonies==
The Riot Act caused confusion during the Gordon Riots of 1780, when the authorities felt uncertain of their power to take action to stop the riots without a reading of the Riot Act. After the riots, Lord Mansfield observed that the Riot Act did not take away the pre-existing power of the authorities to use force to stop a violent riot; it only created the additional offence of failing to disperse after a reading of the Riot Act.

The Riot Act was read prior to the Peterloo Massacre of 1819 and the Cinderloo Uprising of 1821, as well as before the Bristol Riots at Queen&#x27;s Square in 1831. Both are held to be related to the Unreformed House of Commons, which was righted in the Reform Act 1832.

Lieutenant-Governor Sir Francis Bond Head and his administrators read the act during the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837.

The death penalty created by sections one, four and five of the act was reduced to transportation for life by section one of the Punishment of Offences Act 1837.

The Riot Act eventually drifted into disuse. The last time it was definitely read in England was in Birkenhead, Cheshire, on 3 August 1919, during the second police strike, when large numbers of police officers from Birkenhead, Liverpool and Bootle joined the strike. Troops were called in to deal with the rioting and looting that had begun, and a magistrate read out the Riot Act. None of the rioters subsequently faced the charge of a statutory felony. Earlier in the same year, at the battle of George Square on 31 January, in Glasgow, the city&#x27;s sheriff was in the process of reading the Riot Act to a crowd of 20,000–25,000 when the sheet of paper he was reading from was ripped out of his hands by one of the rioters.

The last time it was read in Scotland was by the deputy town clerk James Gildea in Airdrie in 1971.

The act was repealed on 18 July 1973 for the United Kingdom by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1973.

==In other countries==
The Riot Act passed into the law of those countries that were then colonies of Great Britain, including the North American colonies that would become the United States and Canada.

In many common-law jurisdictions, a lesser disturbance such as an affray or an unruly gathering may be deemed an unlawful assembly by the local authorities and ordered to disperse. Failure to obey such an order would typically be prosecuted as a summary offence.

===Australia===
Acts similar to the Riot Act have been enacted in some Australian states. For example, in Victoria the Unlawful Assemblies and Processions Act 1958 allowed a magistrate to disperse a crowd with the words (or words to the effect of):

Anyone remaining after 15 minutes may be charged and imprisoned for one month (first offence) or three months (repeat offence). The act does not apply to crowds gathered for the purpose of an election.

The same act allows a magistrate to appoint citizens as &quot;special [police] constables&quot; to disperse a crowd and provides indemnity for the hurting or killing of unlawfully assembled people in an attempt to disperse them. The Act was significantly amended in 2007.

===Belize===
Belize, another former British colony, also still retains the principle of the Riot Act; it was last read on 21 January 2005, during the 2005 Belize unrest. While there is no specific form of words provided for such proclamations, they must be made &quot;in the King&#x27;s name&quot;.

The provisions are formed in sections 231, 246 and 247 of the country&#x27;s criminal code, providing particularly that:

Any person who does not disperse within one hour of the proclamation being read is liable to receive a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.

===Canada===
In Canada, the Riot Act has been incorporated in a modified form into the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, a federal statute. Sections 32 and 33 of the Code deal with the power of police officers to suppress riots. The Code defines a riot as an &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; that has &quot;begun to disturb the peace tumultuously&quot;. When twelve or more persons are &quot;unlawfully and riotously assembled together&quot;, the proclamation can be read by a number of public officials, such as justices of the peace, provincial court judges, mayors, and sheriffs. The proclamation can also be read during prison riots: Quebec and Manitoba have designated senior correctional staff as justices of the peace for the purpose of reading the proclamation, while other provinces will ask a local justice of the peace to travel to the prison to read the proclamation.

In the act the proclamation is to be worded as follows, or words to the same effect:

(Since the monarch is now a King, the obvious changes are made.) Unlike the original Riot Act, the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; requires the assembled people to disperse within thirty minutes. When the proclamation has not been read, the punishment for rioting is up to two years of imprisonment. When the proclamation has been read and then ignored, the penalty increases, up to life imprisonment. The maximum penalty of life imprisonment also applies to someone who wilfully uses force to hinder the reading of the proclamation, or to those fail to disperse and who have reasonable grounds to believe the proclamation would have been made had the official not been hindered by force.

The proclamation was read during the Winnipeg general strike of 1919 and the 1958 riot over racial discrimination against First Nations in Prince Rupert, British Columbia. One recent reading was during Vancouver&#x27;s Stanley Cup riot in June 2011. Despite the reading of the proclamation, rioters were almost always charged under s 65 due to the difficulty of proving the elements of the offence in s 68. Many rioters also faced charges related to assaulting peace officers, mischief, theft, arson and assault.

=== Caribbean region ===
In St Kitts on 29 January 1935 the act was read at Buckley&#x27;s Estate located on the western outskirts of Basseterre during a strike of sugar workers that turned violent.

In St Vincent on 21 October 1935 the act was read in Kingstown during a violent protest by unemployed sugar workers.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand the Riot Act was incorporated into sections 87 and 88 of the Crimes Act 1961, and repealed in March of 1987. The proclamation was worded as follows:

The need to read the Riot Act was removed by section three of the Crimes Amendment Act (1987 No 1).

===United States===
A riot act was passed by the Massachusetts state legislature in 1786 during Shays&#x27; Rebellion.

At the federal level, the principle of the Riot Act was incorporated into the first Militia Act (1 Stat. 264) of 2 May 1792. The act&#x27;s long title was &quot;An act to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions&quot;. Section 3 of the Militia Act gave power to the president to issue a proclamation to &quot;command the insurgents to disperse, and retire peaceably to their respective abodes, within a limited time&quot;, and authorized him to use the militia if they failed to do so. Substantively identical language is currently codified in title 10 of the United States Code, Chapter 13, Section 254.

Prohibitions against inciting riots were further codified in United States federal law under &quot;18 U.S. Code § 2101 – Riots&quot;, as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, passed by the United States Congress.

==&quot;Read the Riot Act&quot;==
Because the authorities were required to read the proclamation that referred to the Riot Act before they could enforce it, the expression &quot;&quot; entered into common language as a phrase meaning &quot;to reprimand severely&quot;, with the added sense of a stern warning.
