<text>A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) representation of a higher-dimensional data set while preserving the topological structure of the data. For example, a data set with formula_1 variables measured in formula_2 observations could be represented as clusters of observations with similar values for the variables. These clusters then could be visualized as a two-dimensional &quot;map&quot; such that observations in proximal clusters have more similar values than observations in distal clusters. This can make high-dimensional data easier to visualize and analyze.

An SOM is a type of artificial neural network but is trained using competitive learning rather than the error-correction learning (e.g., backpropagation with gradient descent) used by other artificial neural networks. The SOM was introduced by the Finnish professor Teuvo Kohonen in the 1980s and therefore is sometimes called a Kohonen map or Kohonen network. The Kohonen map or network is a computationally convenient abstraction building on biological models of neural systems from the 1970s and morphogenesis models dating back to Alan Turing in the 1950s.
SOMs create internal representations reminiscent of the cortical homunculus, a distorted representation of the human body, based on a neurological &quot;map&quot; of the areas and proportions of the human brain dedicated to processing sensory functions, for different parts of the body.

== Overview ==
Self-organizing maps, like most artificial neural networks, operate in two modes: training and mapping. First, training uses an input data set (the &quot;input space&quot;) to generate a lower-dimensional representation of the input data (the &quot;map space&quot;). Second, mapping classifies additional input data using the generated map.

In most cases, the goal of training is to represent an input space with &quot;p&quot; dimensions as a map space with two dimensions. Specifically, an input space with &quot;p&quot; variables is said to have &quot;p&quot; dimensions. A map space consists of components called &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;neurons&quot;, which are arranged as a hexagonal or rectangular grid with two dimensions. The number of nodes and their arrangement are specified beforehand based on the larger goals of the analysis and exploration of the data.

Each node in the map space is associated with a &quot;weight&quot; vector, which is the position of the node in the input space. While nodes in the map space stay fixed, training consists in moving weight vectors toward the input data (reducing a distance metric such as Euclidean distance) without spoiling the topology induced from the map space. After training, the map can be used to classify additional observations for the input space by finding the node with the closest weight vector (smallest distance metric) to the input space vector.

== Learning algorithm ==
The goal of learning in the self-organizing map is to cause different parts of the network to respond similarly to certain input patterns. This is partly motivated by how visual, auditory or other sensory information is handled in separate parts of the cerebral cortex in the human brain.
The weights of the neurons are initialized either to small random values or sampled evenly from the subspace spanned by the two largest principal component eigenvectors. With the latter alternative, learning is much faster because the initial weights already give a good approximation of SOM weights.

The network must be fed a large number of example vectors that represent, as close as possible, the kinds of vectors expected during mapping. The examples are usually administered several times as iterations.

The training utilizes competitive learning. When a training example is fed to the network, its Euclidean distance to all weight vectors is computed. The neuron whose weight vector is most similar to the input is called the best matching unit (BMU). The weights of the BMU and neurons close to it in the SOM grid are adjusted towards the input vector. The magnitude of the change decreases with time and with the grid-distance from the BMU. The update formula for a neuron v with weight vector Wv(s) is
:formula_3,
where &quot;s&quot; is the step index, &quot;t&quot; is an index into the training sample, &quot;u&quot; is the index of the BMU for the input vector D(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;α&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is a monotonically decreasing learning coefficient; &quot;θ&quot;(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) is the neighborhood function which gives the distance between the neuron u and the neuron &quot;v&quot; in step &quot;s&quot;. Depending on the implementations, t can scan the training data set systematically (&quot;t&quot; is 0, 1, 2...&quot;T&quot;-1, then repeat, &quot;T&quot; being the training sample&#x27;s size), be randomly drawn from the data set (bootstrap sampling), or implement some other sampling method (such as jackknifing).

The neighborhood function &quot;θ&quot;(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) (also called &quot;function of lateral interaction&quot;) depends on the grid-distance between the BMU (neuron &quot;u&quot;) and neuron &quot;v&quot;. In the simplest form, it is 1 for all neurons close enough to BMU and 0 for others, but the Gaussian and Mexican-hat functions are common choices, too. Regardless of the functional form, the neighborhood function shrinks with time. At the beginning when the neighborhood is broad, the self-organizing takes place on the global scale. When the neighborhood has shrunk to just a couple of neurons, the weights are converging to local estimates. In some implementations, the learning coefficient &quot;α&quot; and the neighborhood function &quot;θ&quot; decrease steadily with increasing &quot;s&quot;, in others (in particular those where &quot;t&quot; scans the training data set) they decrease in step-wise fashion, once every &quot;T&quot; steps.

This process is repeated for each input vector for a (usually large) number of cycles λ. The network winds up associating output nodes with groups or patterns in the input data set. If these patterns can be named, the names can be attached to the associated nodes in the trained net.

During mapping, there will be one single &quot;winning&quot; neuron: the neuron whose weight vector lies closest to the input vector. This can be simply determined by calculating the Euclidean distance between input vector and weight vector.

While representing input data as vectors has been emphasized in this article, any kind of object which can be represented digitally, which has an appropriate distance measure associated with it, and in which the necessary operations for training are possible can be used to construct a self-organizing map. This includes matrices, continuous functions or even other self-organizing maps.

=== Algorithm ===
# Randomize the node weight vectors in a map
# For formula_4
## Randomly pick an input vector formula_5
## Find the node in the map closest to the input vector. This node is the best matching unit (BMU). Denote it by formula_6
## For each node formula_7, update its vector by pulling closer to the input vector: formula_8

The variable names mean the following, with vectors in bold,
* formula_9 is the current iteration
* formula_10 is the iteration limit
* formula_11 is the index of the target input data vector in the input data set formula_12
* formula_5 is a target input data vector
* formula_7 is the index of the node in the map
* formula_15 is the current weight vector of node formula_7
* formula_6 is the index of the best matching unit (BMU) in the map
* formula_18 is the neighbourhood function,
* formula_19 is the learning rate schedule.
The key design choices are the shape of the SOM, the neighbourhood function, and the learning rate schedule. The idea of the neighborhood function is to make it such that the BMU is updated the most, its immediate neighbors are updated a little less, and so on. The idea of the learning rate schedule is to make it so that the map updates are large at the start, and gradually stop updating.

For example, if we want to learn a SOM using a square grid, we can index it using formula_20 where both formula_21. The neighborhood function can make it so that the BMU updates in full, the nearest neighbors update in half, and their neighbors update in half again, etc.formula_22And we can use a simple linear learning rate schedule formula_23.

Notice in particular, that the update rate does &quot;not&quot; depend on where the point is in the Euclidean space, only on where it is in the SOM itself. For example, the points formula_24 are close on the SOM, so they will always update in similar ways, even when they are far apart on the Euclidean space. In contrast, even if the points formula_25 end up overlapping each other (such as if the SOM looks like a folded towel), they still do not update in similar ways.

=== Alternative algorithm ===
# Randomize the map&#x27;s nodes&#x27; weight vectors
# Traverse each input vector in the input data set
## Traverse each node in the map
### Use the Euclidean distance formula to find the similarity between the input vector and the map&#x27;s node&#x27;s weight vector
### Track the node that produces the smallest distance (this node is the best matching unit, BMU)
## Update the nodes in the neighborhood of the BMU (including the BMU itself) by pulling them closer to the input vector
### formula_3
# Increase formula_9 and repeat from step 2 while formula_28

=== Initialization options ===
Selection of initial weights as good approximations of the final weights is a well-known problem for all iterative methods of artificial neural networks, including self-organizing maps. Kohonen originally proposed random initiation of weights. (This approach is reflected by the algorithms described above.) More recently, principal component initialization, in which initial map weights are chosen from the space of the first principal components, has become popular due to the exact reproducibility of the results.

A careful comparison of random initialization to principal component initialization for a one-dimensional map, however, found that the advantages of principal component initialization are not universal. The best initialization method depends on the geometry of the specific dataset. Principal component initialization was preferable (for a one-dimensional map) when the principal curve approximating the dataset could be univalently and linearly projected on the first principal component (quasilinear sets). For nonlinear datasets, however, random initiation performed better.

== Interpretation ==
There are two ways to interpret a SOM. Because in the training phase weights of the whole neighborhood are moved in the same direction, similar items tend to excite adjacent neurons. Therefore, SOM forms a semantic map where similar samples are mapped close together and dissimilar ones apart. This may be visualized by a U-Matrix (Euclidean distance between weight vectors of neighboring cells) of the SOM.

The other way is to think of neuronal weights as pointers to the input space. They form a discrete approximation of the distribution of training samples. More neurons point to regions with high training sample concentration and fewer where the samples are scarce.

SOM may be considered a nonlinear generalization of Principal components analysis (PCA). It has been shown, using both artificial and real geophysical data, that SOM has many advantages over the conventional feature extraction methods such as Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) or PCA.

Originally, SOM was not formulated as a solution to an optimisation problem. Nevertheless, there have been several attempts to modify the definition of SOM and to formulate an optimisation problem which gives similar results. For example, Elastic maps use the mechanical metaphor of elasticity to approximate principal manifolds: the analogy is an elastic membrane and plate.

==Examples==

* Financial investment
* Project prioritization and selection
* Seismic facies analysis for oil and gas exploration
* Failure mode and effects analysis
*Finding representative data in large datasets
**representative species for ecological communities
**representative days for energy system models

== Alternative approaches ==

* The generative topographic map (GTM) is a potential alternative to SOMs. In the sense that a GTM explicitly requires a smooth and continuous mapping from the input space to the map space, it is topology preserving. However, in a practical sense, this measure of topological preservation is lacking.
* The growing self-organizing map (GSOM) is a growing variant of the self-organizing map. The GSOM was developed to address the issue of identifying a suitable map size in the SOM. It starts with a minimal number of nodes (usually four) and grows new nodes on the boundary based on a heuristic. By using a value called the &quot;spread factor&quot;, the data analyst has the ability to control the growth of the GSOM.
* The conformal map approach uses conformal mapping to interpolate each training sample between grid nodes in a continuous surface. A one-to-one smooth mapping is possible in this approach.
* The time adaptive self-organizing map (TASOM) network is an extension of the basic SOM. The TASOM employs adaptive learning rates and neighborhood functions. It also includes a scaling parameter to make the network invariant to scaling, translation and rotation of the input space. The TASOM and its variants have been used in several applications including adaptive clustering, multilevel thresholding, input space approximation, and active contour modeling. Moreover, a Binary Tree TASOM or BTASOM, resembling a binary natural tree having nodes composed of TASOM networks has been proposed where the number of its levels and the number of its nodes are adaptive with its environment.
* The elastic map approach borrows from the spline interpolation the idea of minimization of the elastic energy. In learning, it minimizes the sum of quadratic bending and stretching energy with the least squares approximation error.
* The oriented and scalable map (OS-Map) generalises the neighborhood function and the winner selection. The homogeneous Gaussian neighborhood function is replaced with the matrix exponential. Thus one can specify the orientation either in the map space or in the data space. SOM has a fixed scale (=1), so that the maps &quot;optimally describe the domain of observation&quot;. But what about a map covering the domain twice or in n-folds? This entails the conception of scaling. The OS-Map regards the scale as a statistical description of how many best-matching nodes an input has in the map.

<doc id="76997" wikidata="Q392294" url="?curid=76997" title="Kryptopterus bicirrhis">
<text>Kryptopterus bicirrhis, often called the glass catfish, is an Asian glass catfish species of the genus &quot;Kryptopterus&quot;. Until 1989, the concept of &quot;K. bicirrhis&quot; included its smaller relative &quot;Kryptopterus vitreolus&quot; (&quot;ghost catfish&quot;; often confused with &quot;K. minor&quot;). Its scientific name &quot;K. bicirrhis&quot; and common name glass catfish are often still used in the aquarium fish trade to refer to the actual &quot;K. vitreolus&quot;; as it seems, the larger and more aggressive true &quot;K. bicirrhis&quot; was only ever exported in insignificant numbers.

In western Borneo, where &quot;K. minor&quot; and &quot;K. bicirrhis&quot; are sympatric, both species are known as lais tipis in the Malay language, but when locals want to distinguish the two, they refer to &quot;K. minor&quot; as lais limpok. In Cambodia it is known as trey kes prak () and used to make the fermented fish paste &quot;prahok&quot;.

==Description==
The true &quot;K. bicirrhis&quot; is easily separated from &quot;K. vitreolus&quot;. &quot;K. bicirrhis&quot; reaches a significantly larger size, up to standard length, and most of its body is not clearly transparent (only obviously transparent around the head). The body of &quot;K. bicirrhis&quot; is mostly opaque and light greyish.

When struck by light, it has an iridescence, and it turns milky white as it dies. It has two long barbels for locating food, which are as long again as the body in front of the anal fin. The dorsal fin is reduced to a tiny triangle, and the pectoral fins are longer than the head.

==Ecology==
&quot;Kryptopterus bicirrhis&quot; is found in Borneo, Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and the Chao Phraya and Mekong drainage basins.

This freshwater catfish inhabits large rivers with turbid water, where they typically live near the shore in fast-flowing water. It seems to prefer peaty water with a rather low temperature for its tropical range, around . It is a diurnal predator and mainly eats water bugs and occasionally smaller fishes.

== Research with Magnetic Fields ==
&quot;Kryptopterus bicirrhis are&quot; extremely responsive to magnetic stimuli and are known to have electroreceptor organs already. Typically, fish that have this sensitivity to magnetic stimuli are migratory and use this for their sense of direction, but they are nonmigratory fish. The &quot;Kryptopterus bicirrhis&quot; swim away from any magnetic field above the value of 20 μT (microtesla). This is due to their EPG (electromagnetic perceptive gene), that of which increases the calcium content in the animal’s cells when the EMF (electromagnetic field) is stronger. This research may, in the future, have great impacts on how we might control cell activity without having to physically touch cells. This might help to increase the amount of noninvasive brain surgeries, granted more research gets done.

<doc id="76998" wikidata="Q509749" url="?curid=76998" title="Bushism">
<text>Bushisms are unconventional statements, phrases, pronunciations, malapropisms, and semantic or linguistic errors made in the public speaking of George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States. Common characteristics of Bushisms include malapropisms, spoonerisms, the creation of neologisms or stunt words, and errors in subject–verb agreement.

==Discussion==
Bush&#x27;s use of the English language in formal and public speeches has spawned several books that document the statements. A poem titled &quot;Make the Pie Higher&quot;, composed entirely of Bushisms, was compiled by cartoonist Richard Thompson. Various public figures and humorists, such as &quot;The Daily Show&quot; host Jon Stewart and &quot;Doonesbury&quot; cartoonist Garry Trudeau, have popularized Bushisms.

Linguist Mark Liberman of Language Log has suggested that Bush is not unusually error-prone in his speech, saying: &quot;You can make any public figure sound like a boob, if you record everything he says and set hundreds of hostile observers to combing the transcripts for disfluencies, malapropisms, word formation errors and examples of non-standard pronunciation or usage... Which of us could stand up to a similar level of linguistic scrutiny?&quot;. In 2010, Philip Hensher called Bush&#x27;s apparent coinage of the term &quot;misunderestimated&quot; one of his &quot;most memorable additions to the language, and an incidentally expressive one: it may be that we rather needed a word for &#x27;to underestimate by mistake&#x27;.&quot;

Stanford University lecturer and former Bush advisor Keith Hennessey has also argued that the number of Bush&#x27;s verbal gaffes is not unusual given the significant amount of time that he has spoken in public, and that his successor Barack Obama&#x27;s gaffes were not as scrutinized. In Hennessey&#x27;s view, Bush &quot;intentionally aimed his public image at average Americans rather than at Cambridge or Upper East Side elites&quot;.

British journalist Christopher Hitchens published an essay in &quot;The Nation&quot; in 2000 titled &quot;Why Dubya Can&#x27;t Read&quot;, writing:

Bush&#x27;s statements were also notorious for their ability to state the opposite of what he intended, including his remarks on the estate tax: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure 80% of people get the death tax. I know this: 100% will get it if I&#x27;m the president.&quot; These incidents have been described as or likened to Freudian slips.

In 2001, Bush poked fun at himself at the annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents Dinner (now the White House Correspondents Dinner), delivering a monologue reacting and responding to his Bushisms.

The term &quot;Bushism&quot; has become part of popular folklore and is the basis of a number of websites and published books. It is often used to caricature Bush.

==Examples==

* &quot;See, in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in, to kind of catapult the propaganda.&quot;

=== Foreign affairs ===
* &quot;I&#x27;m the commander, see. I don&#x27;t need to explain—I do not need to explain why I say things. That&#x27;s the interesting thing about being the President. Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something, but I don&#x27;t feel like I owe anybody an explanation.&quot;

* &quot;Well, I mean that a defeat in Iraq will embolden the enemy and will provide the enemy—more opportunity to train, plan, to attack us. That&#x27;s what I mean. There— it&#x27;s— you know, one of the hardest parts of my job is to connect Iraq to the war on terror.&quot;
* &quot;I just want you to know that, when we talk about war, we&#x27;re really talking about peace.&quot;&quot;&quot;
* &quot;We must stop the terror. I call upon all nations, to do everything they can, to stop these terrorist killers. Thank you...now watch this drive.&quot; – to reporters while playing golf.
* &quot;The decision of one man [Vladimir Putin], to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq. I mean, of Ukraine. Iraq too. Anyway...[I&#x27;m] 75.&quot; – In an address to the George W. Bush Institute, May 18, 2022.

* In January 2000, just before the New Hampshire primary, Bush challenged the members of the Nashua Chamber of Commerce to imagine themselves as a single mother &quot;working hard to put food on your family&quot;.
* &quot;You work three jobs?... Uniquely American, isn&#x27;t it? I mean, that is fantastic that you&#x27;re doing that.&quot; – Omaha, Nebraska, February 4, 2005

===Education===
* &quot;Rarely is the question asked: is our children learning?&quot; – Florence, South Carolina, January 11, 2000.
* &quot;You teach a child to read, and he or her will be able to pass a literacy test.&quot; − Townsend, Tennessee, February 21, 2001.
* &quot;As yesterday&#x27;s positive report card shows, do learn when standards are high and results are measured.&quot; – New York City, September 2007.

<doc id="77002" wikidata="Q718383" url="?curid=77002" title="Gil-galad">
<text>Gil-galad is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium, the last high king of the Noldor, one of the main divisions of Elves. He is mentioned in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, where the hobbit Sam Gamgee recites a fragment of a poem about him, and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. In the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, Gil-galad and Elendil laid siege to the Dark Lord Sauron&#x27;s fortress of Barad-dûr, and fought him hand-to-hand for the One Ring. Gil-galad and Elendil were both killed, but Sauron was wounded. This allowed Elendil&#x27;s son Isildur to cut the Ring from Sauron&#x27;s hand, defeating Sauron, and to take the Ring for himself.

Gil-galad briefly appears at the opening of Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, in several video games based on Middle-earth, and as a secondary character in the TV series &quot;The Rings of Power&quot;.

== Appearances ==

=== Prose ===

Gil-galad was an Elf of a royal house of Beleriand; beyond that, accounts of his birth vary. According to &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, he was born into the house of Finwë as a son of Fingon sometime in the First Age, and as a child, he was sent away during the Siege of Angband for safekeeping with Cirdan the shipwright in the Falas. Alternatively, according to Tolkien&#x27;s last word on the subject, he was a son of Orodreth, who became a son of Angrod, son of Finarfin. Christopher Tolkien rejected these changes for &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, a decision he later regretted.

He became the High King of the Noldor-in-Exile in Beleriand after the fall of Gondolin and the death of the previous High King, Turgon. After the War of Wrath and the end of the First Age, Gil-galad founded a realm in the coastal region of Lindon along the shores of Belegaer, the Great Sea. At its height, his realm extended eastward as far as the Misty Mountains. King Tar-Aldarion of Númenor presented Gil-galad with the gift of some seeds of the Mallorn tree; he in turn gave some to Galadriel, who grew them in the guarded land of Lothlórien. Gil-galad did not take a wife and had no children. He was the first of the Eldar to mistrust a stranger who called himself Annatar, and forbade him from entering Lindon. His mistrust was well founded, for Annatar was in fact Sauron. About the year 1600 of the Second Age, Sauron secretly forged the One Ring. Celebrimbor, the creator of the Three Rings, gave two of them, Narya and Vilya, to Gil-galad for safe-keeping once he knew Sauron&#x27;s intention to take them. Gil-galad passed Narya to Cirdan the shipwright, who stated that this was only to keep it secret; Cirdan never used it. Gil-galad chose to give Vilya, and control of Eriador, to Elrond. War broke out between the Elves and Sauron; Gil-galad asked the Númenóreans for help, and their king Tar-Minastir brought a great force, enabling Gil-galad to defeat Sauron&#x27;s army. 

After the Downfall of Númenor there was peace in Middle-earth. At the end of the Second Age, Sauron reappeared with a newly formed army and made war against the kingdom of Gondor, near his old home of Mordor. Gil-galad formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men with the High King of Men, Elendil. The armies of Elves and Men entered Mordor and laid siege to Sauron&#x27;s fortress of Barad-dûr. At the end of the siege, Sauron finally came forth and fought hand-to-hand against Gil-galad and Elendil on the slopes of Mount Doom, losing the One Ring but killing them both. A record left by Isildur in Minas Tirith implies that Sauron himself killed Gil-galad with the heat of his bare hands. Recalling the encounter at the Council of Elrond at Rivendell before the Fellowship took the One Ring south, Elrond said that only he and Círdan stood by Gil-galad in that fight.

=== Poetry ===
In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, on the way to Weathertop, Aragorn mentions Gil-galad, prompting the hobbit Sam Gamgee to recite a fragment, three stanzas, of &quot;Gil-galad was an Elven-king&quot;: 

Sam&#x27;s companions are impressed, and ask for more; Sam admits that is all that he learnt from Bilbo. Aragorn says the fragment is a translation from &quot;an ancient tongue&quot; and suggests that the hobbits may hear the rest in Rivendell. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey comments that the longer poem does not exist, and that Sam&#x27;s fragment seems to have been composed while Tolkien was writing the chapter. He notes that it has the form of a ballad, each stanza being a quatrain in eulogy mode with end-rhymes in the rhyming pattern AABB/CCDD.

== Artefacts ==

=== Aeglos, the spear ===

Gil-galad&#x27;s spear was named Aeglos or Aiglos, meaning &quot;snow-point&quot; or &quot;snow-thorn&quot; or more commonly &quot;icicle&quot; (&quot;aeg&quot;: sharp, pointed; &quot;los&quot;: snow) because when orcs saw his spear, they would recognize it by its reputation to bring a cold death to them. Elrond said that at the battle of Dagorlad, &quot;we had the mastery: for the Spear of Gil-galad and the Sword of Elendil, Aiglos and Narsil, none could withstand.&quot; The connection of Elf and spear could relate to the English surname Elgar, which may represent Old English , &quot;elf-spear&quot;.

=== Heraldic devices ===


Tolkien created two sketches of heraldic devices for Gil-galad. They were drawn on an envelope posted to him in 1960, along with a device containing a star or Silmaril for Eärendil. The Tolkien scholars Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull note that matching the description in the poem, &quot;The countless stars of heaven&#x27;s field / Were mirrored in his silver shield&quot;, the lozenge-shaped devices both contain stars, with an elongated star in each corner. Margaret Purdy, in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, writes that Gil-galad&#x27;s shield, like all elvish heraldry personal not inherited, seems to incorporate his stars, though the field is blue not silver.

=== Family tree ===

== Concept and creation ==

Gil-galad means &quot;star of bright light&quot; in Sindarin.
His names in Tolkien&#x27;s invented languages of Quenya and Sindarin were Artanáro and Rodnor, respectively. His Sindarin birth name, Ereinion, means &quot;scion of kings&quot;.

Tolkien considered several different parentages for Gil-galad in different draft texts, including making him the son of Orodreth. In the second version of &quot;The Fall of Númenor&quot;, he is called a descendant of Fëanor, who made the Silmarils. Then Tolkien treated him as a son of Finrod Felagund. Christopher Tolkien, editing the published version of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, made Gil-galad the son of Fingon, a decision he later regretted, saying he should have left the parentage obscure.

Renee Vink, of the Dutch Tolkien Society, suggests that the only good reason for making him son of Fingon is the correspondence of the colours, blue and silver, of Gil-galad&#x27;s heraldic device and Fingolfin&#x27;s banner. She notes that the publication of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, based on a limited &quot;grasp of the material&quot;, created a &quot;virtually unshakeable&quot; tradition for this parentage. She argues that Orodreth has a better claim to paternity, for several reasons: the crown of the Noldor in exile (in Middle-earth) then comes to a descendant of Finarfin, king of the Noldor in Aman; a descendant of Finarfin would fight Sauron to avenge Finarfin&#x27;s son Finrod; and as brother to Finduilas, he (alone of the Noldor&#x27;s Kings) would fight with a spear, the weapon that killed his sister.

The scholar of literature Lawrence Krikorian, in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, writes that Elrond&#x27;s account of his personal observation of being Gil-galad&#x27;s herald in the Second Age, thousands of years earlier, helps to make the narrative function as history rather than allegory. This, he writes, lends an impression of depth.

== Adaptations ==

=== Film, TV, and radio ===

In the 1981 BBC Radio 4 dramatisation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the &quot;Lay of Gil-galad&quot; was set to music by Stephen Oliver.

In the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy by Peter Jackson, Gil-galad is portrayed by Mark Ferguson. He appears very briefly in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; during the opening prologue sequence. Gil-galad is mentioned in the behind-the-scenes documentaries included with the Special Extended Edition DVD of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and is listed in the credits. In an interview with Ferguson and Craig Parker (Haldir), Ferguson stated that it had been planned for his death to be depicted onscreen as in the book, but it was considered too violent.

In the Amazon Prime Video &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot; TV series, which focuses on events in the Second Age, Gil-Galad is played by Benjamin Walker.

=== Games ===

Gil-galad has been included in multiple video games since Jackson&#x27;s films were first shown. The 2004 video game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age&quot; featured Mark Ferguson as Gil-galad. Others are the 2007 &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot;; the 2011 &quot;The Lord of the Rings: War in the North&quot;; and the 2012 &quot;Lego The Lord of the Rings&quot; which has Gil-galad near Mount Doom.

<text>The Animals, currently billed as Eric Burdon &amp; The Animals (featuring original frontman Eric Burdon) and also as Animals &amp; Friends (featuring original drummer John Steel), are an English rock band formed in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1963.

The Animals&#x27; original lineup consisted of frontman Eric Burdon, guitarist Hilton Valentine, bass guitarist Chas Chandler, keyboardist Alan Price and drummer John Steel. Known for their gritty, bluesy sound, they balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm-and-blues-oriented album material and were part of the British Invasion of the US.

The Animals rose to prominence with their signature song and transatlantic number-one hit single &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;, and continued this success with hits such as &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Crying&quot;, &quot;See See Rider&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;. They underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s, and suffered from poor business management, leading the original incarnation to split up in 1966. Burdon then assembled a mostly new lineup of musicians under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals; the much-changed act moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic and progressive rock band with hits such as &quot;San Franciscan Nights&quot;, &quot;When I Was Young&quot; and &quot;Sky Pilot&quot; before disbanding at the end of the decade. 

The original lineup of Burdon, Price, Chandler, Valentine and Steel reunited for a one-off benefit concert in Newcastle in 1968. They later launched brief comebacks in 1975 and 1983. Several partial regroupings of the original-era members have occurred since then under various names. Altogether, the band has had ten top-20 hits in both the UK Singles Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The Animals&#x27; original lineup were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

==History==
===The Animals (1962–1966)===
The Animals formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during 1962 and 1963 when Burdon joined the Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo. The original lineup was Burdon (vocals), Price (organ and keyboards), Hilton Valentine (guitar), John Steel (drums) and Bryan &quot;Chas&quot; Chandler (bass).

Originally formed as the Alan Price Combo, they changed their name to the Animals. They were supposedly dubbed &quot;animals&quot; because of their wild stage act, and the name stuck. In a 2013 interview, Burdon denied this, stating that the name was a tribute to a friend known as &quot;Animal&quot; Hogg. In a 2021 interview, Steel affirmed that the name was given them by Graham Bond.

The Animals performed fiery versions of the staple rhythm-and-blues repertoire, covering songs by artists such as Jimmy Reed, John Lee Hooker, and Nina Simone. Signed to EMI&#x27;s Columbia label, their first single was a rocking version of the standard &quot;Baby Let Me Follow You Down&quot; (retitled &quot;Baby Let Me Take You Home&quot;).

In June 1964, the transatlantic number-one hit &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; was released. Burdon&#x27;s vocals and the particular arrangement, featuring Price&#x27;s haunting organ riffs, created perhaps the first folk-rock hit.

In October 1964, the Animals visited New York for concert dates and an appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. They were transported from the airport into Manhattan in a motorcade consisting of Sunbeam Alpine Series IV top-down convertibles with fashion models riding along. The Animals sang &quot;I&#x27;m Crying&quot; and &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;. In December, the MGM film &quot;Get Yourself a College Girl&quot; was released, featuring the Animals and the Dave Clark Five. The Animals sang the Chuck Berry song &quot;Around and Around&quot; in the film.

By May 1965, the group was starting to feel internal pressures. Price left because of personal and musical differences, as well as his fear of flying while on tour. He went on to a successful career as a solo artist and with the Alan Price Set. Mick Gallagher filled in for Price on keyboards for a short time until Dave Rowberry replaced Gallagher. Rowberry was on hand for the hit songs &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;.

Many of the Animals&#x27; hits originated from Brill Building songwriters recruited by Mickie Most, but the group, and Burdon in particular, felt this to be too creatively restrictive. As 1965 ended, the group signed a new deal with their American label MGM Records for the US and Canada and switched to Decca Records for the rest of the world. They also ended their association with Most and began to work with MGM Records producer Tom Wilson, who allowed them more artistic freedom. In early 1966, MGM collected the band&#x27;s hits on &quot;The Best of The Animals&quot;, and it became their best-selling album in the US. In February 1966, Steel left and was replaced by Barry Jenkins. A leftover rendition of Goffin–King&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot; was the group&#x27;s last hit as the Animals. The next single, &quot;See See Rider&quot;, was credited to Eric Burdon and the Animals. By September 1966, the original incarnation of the group had split up. Their last batch of recordings was released on the album &quot;Animalism&quot; in November 1966.

Burdon began work on a solo album called &quot;Eric Is Here&quot;, which also featured his UK number-14 solo hit single &quot;Help Me, Girl&quot;, which he heavily promoted on TV shows such as &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in late 1966. &quot;Eric Is Here&quot; was Burdon&#x27;s final release for Decca Records.

By this time, the Animals&#x27; business affairs &quot;were in a total shambles&quot; according to Chandler, and the group disbanded.

=== Eric Burdon and The Animals (1966–1968) ===

A group with Burdon, Jenkins and new sidemen John Weider (guitar/violin/bass), Vic Briggs (guitar/piano) and Danny McCulloch (bass) was formed under the name Eric Burdon and Animals (or sometimes Eric Burdon and the New Animals) in December 1966, and changed direction. The new lineup pursued a fusion of progressive rock, psychedelic, soul and folk music that was far removed from their original blues-oriented sound.

Early performances by this group did not include any of the hits for which the original group had become known. Some of the new Animals&#x27; hits included &quot;San Franciscan Nights&quot;, &quot;Monterey&quot; and &quot;Sky Pilot&quot;. Their sound was much heavier than that of the original group, with Burdon screaming more and louder on live versions of &quot;Paint It Black&quot; and &quot;Hey Gyp&quot;. By 1968, they had developed a more experimental sound on songs such as &quot;We Love You Lil&quot; and the 19-minute &quot;New York 1963–America 1968&quot; from the album &quot;Every One of Us&quot;.

Zoot Money was added to the lineup in April 1968, initially as organist/pianist only, but upon McCulloch&#x27;s departure, he also took on bass and occasional lead vocals.

In July 1968, Andy Summers (later the guitarist for the Police) replaced Briggs. Both Money and Summers were formerly of British psychedelic outfit Dantalian&#x27;s Chariot, and much of this new lineup&#x27;s set was composed of Dantalian&#x27;s Chariot songs, which caught Burdon&#x27;s interest. Because of Money&#x27;s multi-instrumental load, in live settings, bass was played alternately by Weider and Summers.

By December 1968, this incarnation of The Animals had dissolved, but their double album &quot;Love Is&quot; was released internationally, featuring the singles &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; and &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot;.

Numerous reasons have been cited for the breakup, the most famous of which involved an aborted Japanese tour. The tour had been scheduled for September 1968 but was delayed until November after difficulty obtaining visas. Only a few dates into the tour, the promoters (whom the band did not know were &quot;yakuza&quot;) kidnapped the band&#x27;s manager and threatened him at gunpoint to write an IOU for $25,000 to cover losses incurred by the tour&#x27;s delay. Correctly surmising that his captors could not read English, he added a note to the IOU that it was written under duress. The &quot;yakuza&quot; released him, but warned that he and the band would have to leave Japan the next day or be killed. The Animals promptly fled the country, leaving all of their tour equipment behind. Money and Summers each pursued solo careers, Weider signed up with Family and Burdon joined forces with a funk/R&amp;B/rock group from Long Beach, California, called War.

===Reunions of the Animals===
The original Animals lineup of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler and Steel reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in December 1968 and reformed in late 1975 to record again. Burdon later said that nobody understood why they had agreed to this short reunion. They embarked on a brief tour in 1976 and shot videos for their new songs such as &quot;Lonely Avenue&quot; and &quot;Please Send Me Someone to Love&quot;. They released an album in 1977 that was aptly titled &quot;Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted&quot;. The album received critical praise. Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demos at that time that were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed with Price and a complete lineup, foreshadowing future events.

All five original band members reunited in 1983 for the album &quot;Ark&quot; and a world concert tour, supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards, Nippy Noya on percussion, Steve Gregory on saxophone and Steve Grant on guitar. The first single, &quot;The Night&quot;, reached number 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The band released a second single called &quot;Love Is for All Time&quot;, which did not chart.

Songs performed on the &quot;Ark&quot; tour included some from the 1960s, but most were from the band&#x27;s contemporary repertoire, such as &quot;Heart Attack&quot;, &quot;No More Elmore&quot; (both released a year earlier by Burdon), &quot;Oh Lucky Man&quot; (from the 1973 soundtrack album to &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; by Price), &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot; and &quot;Young Girls&quot; (later released on Burdon&#x27;s compilation album &quot;The Night&quot;). Their Wembley Arena concert on 31 December 1983 (supporting the Police) was released on the &quot;Rip It to Shreds&quot; live album in 1984 after the Animals had disbanded again. Their 29 November 1983 concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in Royal Oak, Michigan, was released on 27 February 2008 as &quot;Last Live Show&quot;. A film about the reunion tour was shot but never released.

Chandler died from an aneurysm in 1996, putting an end to any possibility of another reunion of the full original lineup.

=== Later incarnations ===

During the 1990s and 2000s, several groups have called themselves the Animals in part:
*In the 1990s, Danny McCulloch, from the later-1960s Animals, released several albums as the Animals. The albums contained covers of some original Animals songs, as well as new ones written by McCulloch.
*In 1992, Barry Jenkins joined a reconstituted version of The Animals, including &quot;New Animals&quot; members Vic Briggs and Danny McCulloch along with new percussionist Jack McCulloch and Phil Ryan instead of Eric Burdon on lead vocals. The band played the first rock concert held in Red Square, Moscow, as part of a benefit concert for the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
*The band then morphed into Animals and Friends, with Peter Barton on vocals, Rodford, and John E. Williamson on guitar. When Rowberry died in 2003, he was replaced by Mick Gallagher (who had briefly replaced Price in 1965). Danny Handley joined the band in 2009, initially as lead guitarist, but replaced Barton on lead vocals when Barton retired in 2012. This successful lineup continues to tour the world with guests such as Steve Cropper and Spencer Davis.
*Burdon formed a new backing band in 1998 that was billed as Eric Burdon and the New Animals. This was actually just a renaming of an existing band with whom he had been touring in various forms since 1990. Members of this new group included Dean Restum, Dave Meros, Neal Morse and Aynsley Dunbar. Martin Gerschwitz replaced Morse in 1999 after Ryo Okumoto&#x27;s brief three-week stint, and Dunbar was replaced by Bernie Pershey in 2001. In 2003, the band started touring as Eric Burdon and the Animals. After the lineup changed in 2006, original guitarist Valentine joined the group for its 2007 and 2008 tours. The group also included Red Young, Paula O&#x27;Rourke and Tony Braunagle. After Burdon lost the rights to the name, he formed a new band with different musicians.
*In 2016, Burdon formed the current lineup of the Animals, including Johnzo West (guitar/vocals), Davey Allen (keys/vocals), Dustin Koester (drums/vocals), Justin Andres (bass guitar/vocals), Ruben Salinas (sax/flute) and Evan Mackey (trombone). The band performed at the Fool In Love Festival amongst other legendary performers in Los Angeles, CA on 31 August 2024.

===Dispute over ownership of band name===
In 2008, an adjudicator determined that original Animals drummer John Steel owned &quot;the Animals&quot; name in the UK because of a trademark registration that Steel had filed. Eric Burdon had objected to the trademark registration, arguing that he personally embodied any goodwill associated with &quot;the Animals&quot; name. Burdon&#x27;s argument was rejected, in part because he had billed himself as &quot;Eric Burdon and the Animals&quot; as early as 1967, thus separating the goodwill associated with his own name from that of the band. On 9 September 2013, Burdon&#x27;s appeal was allowed, and he is now permitted to use the name &quot;the Animals&quot;.

===Legacy===
The original Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, although Burdon did not attend and the band did not perform. In 2003, the band&#x27;s version of &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; ranked number 123 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. Their 1965 hit single &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot; was ranked number 233 on the same list. Both songs are included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.

On 15 March 2012, in a keynote speech to an audience at the South by Southwest music festival, Bruce Springsteen discussed the Animals&#x27; influence on his music at length, stating, &quot;To me, the Animals were a revelation. They were the first records with full-blown class consciousness that I&#x27;d ever heard.&quot; Of &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot; (written by two New York songwriters, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil), Springsteen said: &quot;That&#x27;s every song I&#x27;ve ever written ... That&#x27;s &#x27;Born to Run,&#x27; &#x27;Born in the U.S.A.,&#x27; everything I&#x27;ve done for the past 40 years including all the new ones. That struck me so deep. It was the first time I felt I heard something come across the radio that mirrored my home life, my childhood.&quot; Saying that his album &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; was &quot;filled with Animals&quot;, Springsteen played the opening riffs to &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; and his own &quot;Badlands&quot; back to back, then said, &quot;Listen up, youngsters! This is how successful theft is accomplished!&quot;

Tony Banks, keyboardist of the English progressive rock band Genesis, drew influence from Alan Price, whom he regarded as &quot;[t]he first person who made me aware of the organ in a rock context&quot;.

<text>The Dominican Republic is a representative democracy, where the president of the Dominican Republic functions as both the head of the government and head of the multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in the bicameral National Congress. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.

== Political culture ==
=== Sovereignty ===
With the proclamation of the first constitution in the Dominican Republic on 6 November 1844 in the city of San Cristobal, the Dominican theory of sovereignty, &#x27;independence politics&#x27;, was formed. The Dominican Republic would remain for the most part republican and representative.

The constitution of San Cristobal established the legislature as superior to the other branches, the judiciary as an independent and the Executive to run the state day-to-day under the oversight of the judiciary and the legislature.

The Congress of the Dominican Republic consists of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.

The president of the republic was presented as an impartial public figure that would provide a source of unity to the republic.

==Executive branch==
The Executive Branch is charged with the daily administration of the state, subject to the oversight of the judicial and legislative branches. The president functions as the head of state, the head of government, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Dominican Armed Forces.

The Dominican Cabinet is responsible for assisting the president in his duty to govern the nation and the president appoints ministers as he sees appropriate.

The president and vice president are elected on the same ticket by popular vote for a four-year term without immediate re-election. After at least one constitutional term, a person who has held the post of president before may run for this office again, according to the last amendment made to the Constitution in 2010. Elections are held in years evenly divisible by four.

The Dominican Constitution takes twenty-seven paragraphs to spell out the president&#x27;s extensive powers. Among the most important are those that grant him authority over virtually all appointments and removals of public officials, and even popular elected ones; empower him to promulgate the laws passed by Congress; direct him to engage in diplomatic relations; and empower him to command, to deploy, and to make appointments in, the armed forces. The president also has vast emergency powers to suspend basic rights in times of emergency, to defer the legislature, to declare a state of siege, and to rule by decree.

The 1966 Constitution provides for ministers and subcabinet ministers to assist in public administration. These officials must be Dominican citizens, at least twenty-five years of age, with full civil and political rights. The powers of the ministers are determined by law. However, the president is constitutionally responsible for the actions of his ministers. Ministers serve at the president&#x27;s discretion, and function both as administrators of their ministries and as agents of presidential authority.

===Military===
The military consists of about 45,000 active duty personnel. Its principal mission is to defend the nation, but it serves more as an internal security force. The army, twice as large as the other services combined, consists of four infantry brigades and a combat support brigade; the air force operates three flying squadrons; and the navy maintains 30 aging vessels. The Dominican Republic&#x27;s military is second in size to Cuba&#x27;s in the Caribbean.

The armed forces participate fully in counter-narcotics efforts. They also are active in efforts to control contraband and illegal immigration from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and from the Dominican Republic to the United States and Puerto Rico.

=== Attorney general ===
See Attorney General of the Republic (Dominican Republic)

The attorney general is appointed by the president. In order to become an attorney general, the individual must be meet the following requirements:

# They must be Dominican by birth or origin and must be older than 35.
# Must be able to exercise full political rights
# Much have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher in law
# Must be a practices lawyer or a university professor of law for at least 12 years, or have spent the same amount of time as a representative of the Public Ministry or as a judge within the Judicial Power.

==Legislative branch==
Legislative power is exercised by a bicameral National Congress (&quot;Congreso de la República&quot;). The upper house is the Senate (&quot;Senado&quot;) with 32 members, elected for a four-year term in single-seat constituencies. The lower house is the Chamber of Deputies () with 178 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in accordance to each province, as follows: one deputy is elected for every 50,000 inhabitants plus fraction exceeding 25,000, but never less than two.

Among the attributions of the Senate are the following:

*Studying and approving laws.
*To appoint the president and other members of the Central Electoral Board and their deputies.
*To appoint the members of the Public Accounts Chamber.
*To approve or not the appointment of diplomatic agents made by the Executive.
*To decide on the claims of the Chamber of Deputies against public officers for misconduct or serious faults in the performance of their duties.
*In the event of public accusation, the Senate may only impose the sanction of removal from office. However, the removed officer may be subject to being tried according to the respective statutes, if applicable. For the removal of office, a vote of at least ¾ of all members of the Senate is required.

Congressional and municipal elections are held separately from the presidential elections. Re-election is always possible, without any limitation. The office of senator and deputy are incompatible with any other position or employment at the Public Administration.

== Judicial branch ==
The Judicial Power is charged of administering justice in order to ensure the respect, protection and supervision of rights recognized under the Constitution and laws. Its higher organ is the Supreme Court of Justice, which is composed of 16 judges appointed by the National Council of the Magistracy, an entity created by the constitutional reform of 1994 to ensure the independence of the Judicial Branch.

The National Council of Magistrates is nominated by the three major political parties. It is presided over by the president of the republic, and has the following members:

*The president of the Senate, and a senator chosen by the Senate from a different party than the president of the Senate.
*The president of the Chamber of Deputies, and a deputy chosen by the Chamber of Deputies from a different party than the president of the Chamber of Deputies.
*The current president of the Supreme Court of Justice.
* A judge of the Supreme Court of Justice chosen by this court, which serves as secretary.

The Supreme Court hears appeals from lower courts (as a Court of Cassation) and chooses members of lower courts. It has sole jurisdiction over actions against the president, designated members of his cabinet, and members of Congress. It has administrative and financial autonomy.

Apart from working as an appeals court for all judgments rendered by judicial courts, the Supreme Court supervises all judges in the Dominican territory. Its judicial and administrative functions may be summarized as follows:

*To decide on appeals as statutorily established.
*To decide as last instance on the matters that are under the jurisdiction of Appeals Courts as court of first instance.
*To decide as only instance on the criminal cases against the President and Vice-president of the Republic, Senators, Deputies, Ministers, Vice-ministers, Supreme Court Judges, Public General Attorney, Judges and General Attorneys of Appeals Courts, State attorneys of the Land Courts and Judges of Administrative Courts.
*To decide as only instance on the constitutionality of laws, at the request of the Executive Power, one of the Presidents of the legislative chambers or an interested party.
*To appoint the judges of the Appeals court, the Land courts, the Courts of First Instance, the Judges of Instruction, the Peace Courts and their deputies, the Administrative-Tax Court and the judges of any other judicial courts created by law, according to the provisions of the Law on Judicial Career.
*To exercise the highest disciplinary authority on all members of the Judicial Power, being able to impose sanctions such as suspension, removal or prison.
*To transfer provisionally or definitively from one jurisdiction to another, as it may deem necessary, the judges of the Appeals Court, the judges of First Instance of the Land Courts, the Judges of Instruction, the Peace Judges and other court judges created by law.
*To create the administrative positions that may be necessary to comply with the attributions granted by the Constitution and laws.
*To appoint all officers and employees of the Judicial Power.
*To determine the wages and other payments of Judges and administrative personnel belonging to the Judicial Power.

==Municipal government and administrative divisions==
Each of the 31 provinces is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. People-elected mayors and municipal councils administer the National District (Santo Domingo) and the 103 municipal districts.

The Dominican Republic has 31 provinces (&quot;provincias&quot;) and one National District* (&quot;Distrito Nacional&quot;): Azua, Baoruco, Barahona, Dajabón, Duarte, El Seibo, Elías Piña, Espaillat, Hato Mayor, Independencia, La Altagracia, La Romana, La Vega, María Trinidad Sánchez, Monseñor Nouel, Monte Cristi, Monte Plata, Pedernales, Peravia, Puerto Plata, Hermanas Mirabal, Samaná, Sánchez Ramírez, San Cristóbal, San José de Ocoa, San Juan, San Pedro de Macorís, Santiago, Santiago Rodríguez, Santo Domingo, Distrito Nacional, and Valverde.

 
It is politically divided into 31 provinces and one national district (Art.5 Constitution). Each province is divided into municipalities, of which there are 117 in the country, each of which is divided into smaller territorial units, such as municipal districts, rural areas and villages. There are currently 70 municipal districts in the Dominican Republic. The municipalities and municipal districts consist of an urban area and several rural areas, of which there are 715 in the country. The rural district consists of several places, as today a total of 8,783 in the country.

==Political history since 1996==

The Dominican Republic has a multi-party political system with national elections every four years. In two rounds of presidential elections in 1996, nearly 80% of eligible Dominican voters went to the polls. The leading parties in 1994 were the PRSC, linked to the International Christian Democratic political movement, whose candidate was President Joaquín Balaguer; the PRD, affiliated with the Socialist International, whose candidate was José Francisco Peña Gómez; and the PLD, whose candidate was former President Juan Bosch.

In the 1994 elections, international observers noted many irregularities in the voter lists, and the opposition PRD immediately charged the Central Electoral Board and the PRSC with fraud. A Verification Commission appointed by the Central Electoral Board, however, did not accept the PRD&#x27;s charges. By all estimates, total disenfranchised voters far exceeded the 22,281-vote margin of victory in favor of President Balaguer on 2 August 1994.

Following an intense period of political activity, the competing political parties signed a Pact for Democracy on 10 August, reducing President Balaguer&#x27;s term of office from 4 to 2 years, setting early elections, and reforming the constitution. A new Central Electoral Board was named to work on electoral reform. The main candidates in 1996 were Vice President Jacinto Peynado (PRSC), José Francisco Peña Gómez (PRD), and Leonel Fernández (PLD).

Domestic and international observers saw the 1996 election as transparent and fair. After the first round in which Jacinto Peynado (PRSC) was eliminated, the PRSC with Joaquín Balaguer endorsed Leonel Fernández (PLD). Results in the second round, 45 days later on 30 June, were tabulated quickly, and although the victory margin was narrow (1.5%), it was never questioned. The transition from incumbent administration to incoming administration was smooth and ushered in a new, modern era in Dominican political life.

Fernández&#x27; political agenda was one of economic and judicial reform. He helped enhance Dominican participation in hemispheric affairs, such as the Organization of American States and the follow-up to the Miami Summit. On 16 May 2000, Hipólito Mejía, the Revolutionary Democratic Party candidate, was elected president in another free and fair election. He defeated Dominican Liberation Party candidate Danilo Medina 49.8% to 24.84%. Former President Balaguer garnered 24.68% of the vote. Mejia entered office on 16 August with four priorities: education reform, economic development, increased agricultural production, and poverty alleviation. Mejía also champions the cause of Central American and Caribbean economic integration and migration, particularly as it relates to Haiti. On 16 May 2004, Leonel Fernández, running for the Dominican Liberation Party, garnered about 57% of the vote. On 16 May 2008, Leonel Fernández, running for the Dominican Liberation Party, garnered about 54% of the vote for a second consecutive term in office.

In 2012, Danilo Medina narrowly won election as president against Hipólito Mejía. An accord with former president Fernandez, ratified by the broad PLD leadership, called for a change in the constitution to allow a second consecutive term as president, but with Leonel Fernandez installed as the head of the PLD pending his turn as candidate for the presidency in 2020. The constitution was changed, and Medina won reelection by a wide margin against Luis Abinader of the Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM).

MejíaIn the runup to the 2020 presidential elections, supporters of President Medina pushed for an additional change to the country&#x27;s constitution to permit a third term. While Medina himself publicly remained uncommitted to another term, a fierce struggle within the PLD ensued. Following demonstrations outside the congress led by Leonel Fernandez himself, and subsequently pressure from the United States (notably through a public readout of a call from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo), president Medina announced on July 22, 2019, that he would not run again, calling instead for &quot;new blood&quot; (i.e., not supporting ex-president Fernandez). Medina supports former Minister of Public Works Gonzalo Castillo against Fernandez in primaries for the PLD nomination scheduled for October 6. Within the PRM, Abinader is being challenged for the nomination by ex-president Mejía.

==Elections and political parties==

=== Political parties ===

==== Dominican Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Dominicano, PRD) ====
The Dominican Revolutionary Party was founded mainly by Juan Bosch, Juan Isidro Jimenes Grullón, and Rafael Mainardi Reyna, among other Trujillo-era exiles on January 21, 1939, in Havana, Cuba. After Trujillo&#x27;s death, Juan Bosch, running on behalf of the PRD in 1963, became the first democratically elected official in the country&#x27;s history. The party has won the presidency four times since its founding, having won in 1963, 1978, 1982, and in the 2000 elections. The PRD currently holds one seat in the senate, 57 of 155 mayors, and 16 of the 190 seats in the chamber of deputies. The PRD&#x27;s main ideology is centre, with certain factions of the party being centre-left and centre-right, although the party has been considered more conservative than the PRD in recent years. The current party leader, who is also the current minister of the department of the interior, is Miguel Vargas Maldonado. The general secretary of the party is Tony Peña Guaba. The Dominican Revolutionary party colors are light blue and white.

==== Dominican Liberation Party (Partido de la Liberación Dominicana, PLD) ====
The PLD was founded by former president Juan Bosch in December 15, 1973. The following year, the party participated in the national elections for the first time. The party had its first national victory in 1996, with Leonel Fernandez becoming the party&#x27;s first elected president and the 50th president of Dominican Republic overall. The party has been elected into office four times since its founding, having won the presidential elections in 1996, 2004, 2008, and in the 2012 elections. Currently, the PLD has 26 of 32 seats in the senate, 106 out of 155 mayors, and 106 out of 190 in the chamber of deputies. According to the Party&#x27;s official website, the PLD considers itself to be primarily centre-left, rejecting populism and neoliberalism. The current party leader is former President Danilo Medina Sanchez. The Dominican Liberation Party has yellow and purple as its representative colours.

==== Modern Revolutionary Party ====

The Dominican Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Moderno, PRM) is a political party in the Dominican Republic. Traditionally a left-of-centre party and social democratic in nature, the party has shifted since the 2000s toward the political centre. The party&#x27;s distinctive color is white. Traditionally, the party has two presidents: the &quot;titular president&quot; and the &quot;acting president&quot; (and actually, a sort of vice-president); until 2010 the presidents and the secretary-general were proscribed to run for any elected office.
The party came to power in the 2020 Dominican Republic general election.

===Elections===

Presidential elections are held in the Dominican Republic every four years, on the 16 May. The candidate must gain a majority vote of at least 50% plus one to win the presidency in the first round. If none of the candidates obtains such a majority, a second poll will take place 45 days later, at which the population will decide between the two candidates that had the best results during the first poll.

==Political history==
After many years of dictatorship or corrupt democracy, the regime is believed to have shown some legitimacy after the election in 1996, in which the longtime leader Balaguer lost power to Leonel Fernández. The form of government is a representative democracy with two chambers and president one as head of state, government one and army one. According to the Constitution, the president has great power. Among other things, he can override the laws that Congress brings, and he has the power to repeal all laws and introduce his own by state of emergency.

Leonel Fernández and the government are at the center of the political scene. There are three main political parties. Partido Revolucionado Dominicano (PRD), which is socialist, Partido de la Liberación Dominicana (PLD), which is conservative / liberal and Partido Reformista Social Cristiano (PRSC), which is Balaguer&#x27;s old right - wing party. Leonel Fernández, and his bloc with the mother party PLD have a majority in all chambers. The big task is to restore the conditions as before the recession of 2003-2004, and they are working closely with the World Bank. Tight fiscal policy is pursued and privatizations are implemented.

Relations with the US have improved since Leonel Fernández&#x27;s accession. Here, the events in Haiti are an important factor. Balaguer, the former president, made himself unpopular in the United States by criticizing U.S. intervention in Haiti. The United States had arranged for Aristide to be deployed, but Balaguer was not happy about that. Leonel Fernández, however, was ready to bury the hatchet and became the first Dominican president to visit Haiti in 70 years. Today, trade with the United States accounts for 87% of the country&#x27;s trade, so it requires a good relationship between the parties. Leonel Fernández&#x27;s government has placed the country under great power.
The Dominican Republic has a close relationship with the United States, and has close cultural ties with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other states and jurisdictions in the United States.
The Dominican Republic&#x27;s relations with neighboring Haiti are strained over mass migration from Haiti to the Dominican Republic, where citizens of the Dominican Republic blame the Haitians for increased crime and other social problems. The Dominican Republic is a regular member of the Organization Internationale de la Francophonie.
The Dominican Republic has a free trade agreement with the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua through the Dominican Republic-Central America free trade agreement. And an Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union and the Caribbean Community through the Caribbean Forum.

<text>The government of Ethiopia () is the federal government of Ethiopia. It is structured in a framework of a federal parliamentary republic, whereby the prime minister is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. The prime minister is chosen by the lower chamber of the Federal Parliamentary Assembly. Federal legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament. The judiciary is more or less independent of the executive and the legislature. They are governed under the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia. There is a bicameral parliament made of the 108-seat House of Federation and the 547-seat House of Peoples&#x27; Representatives. The House of Federation has members chosen by the regional councils to serve five-year terms. The House of Peoples&#x27; Representatives is elected by direct election, who in turn elect the president for a six-year term.

==History==

Ethiopia has always oscillated between centralisation of power, this was accelerated under the 19th century emperors Tewodros II (1855–68) and Yohannes IV (1872–89). This was replicated in modern times under thhe Derg regime, after the fall of the Derg, the federalism introduced in 1991 by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).

Historically, the Ethiopian Empire, known as &quot;Abyssinia&quot; and &quot;Ze-Etiyopia&quot; called prior to the mid-19th century, consisted mainly of the Amhara and Tigrayans. These are northern people who share a similar language, culture and customs, who now make up c. 24% and 6% respectively of modern Ethiopia. Tewodros II reunified Northern Ethiopia from 1855, while his successor Yohannes IV embarked on a series of brutal military campaigns between 1880–1889 to conquer and annex the southern and eastern regions, namely western Oromo, Sidama, Gurage, Wolayta and other groups, leading largely to the current national borders.

The inhabitants of these Southern states had different languages and customs; mostly Muslim and Pagan, but particularly the most populous group, the Oromos, 34% currently, occupied valuable agricultural and developable lands which now contain the capital Addis Ababa, the heart of urban Ethiopia and its industrial hub on traditional Oromo lands.

The conquest involved mass killings, which would now be termed genocide, enslavement, land confiscation and forcible conversion to Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, motivated by a cultural contempt for what were considered inferior peoples. These historical memories persist in part, aggravated even today by ‘land grabs’ in the southern Oromo heartland by the ruling non-Oromo hegemony and by similar competition for land and resources between the Amhara and Ethiopian Somalis in the North.

The centralised Ethiopian Empire under Haile Selassie was abolished following the Ethiopian Revolution, the Mengistu and communist Derg coup of 1974, replaced by an equally centralised Marxist-Leninist system, including the continuation of the military campaigns started by Haile Selassie in 1961 against the resistance within Eritrea, annexed in 1961, which persisted until 1991, and against the Somali Ogaden invasion of 1977/78.

Following the dissolution of the Derg in 1991, by the TPLF, which ended the Ethiopian Civil War and established independence for Eritrea, Ethiopia formed a transitional government along federal lines which lasted until 1995. The 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia was promulgated by the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which enshrined a form of ethnic-based federalism, consisting of 11 ethno-linguistically defined regional states and 2 chartered cities. The states are: Afar; Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz; Gambela; Harari; Oromia; Somali; the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples&#x27; Region; Tigray; Sidama; and South West Ethiopia. The chartered cities are Addis Ababa, the country&#x27;s capital, and Dire Dawa. The federal structure was intended to alleviate the persistent historical ethnic tensions by establishing regional autonomy and a degree of self-rule. Article 39, Section 1 states: &quot;Every nation, nationality and people has an unconditional right to self-determination including the right to section.&quot; Each ethnic territory was thus given the right to secede, which was welcomed by those federally-minded but proved controversial amongst supporters of Ethiopian nationalism and its diaspora, especially the previously dominant Amhara, who feared it would decentralise government and induce ethnic tensions.

After the 1995 general election, Meles Zenawi, chairman of the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front, was appointed as Prime Minister. His government reversed the communist policies of the Derg and progressively encouraged privatization of government companies, farms, lands, and investments. This socioeconomic and partial political liberalization within a federalist system, combined with a return of considerable foreign investment led to significant economic growth, double-digit in his last 9 years until his sudden death in 2012. His deputy Hailemariam Desalegn, assumed power, which was only confirmed by elections in 2015. Under the leadership of Hailemariam, the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front and EPRDF maintained the same policies until 2018, earning Ethiopia the status as the fastest-growing economy in Africa. While Meles introduced many social reforms, there was still a notable degree of political and media suppression, coupled with allegations of election meddling in 2005. The TPLF, drawn from only 6% of the population, was seen as unduly favourable to Tigrayans, with resentment from the majority Oromos (34%) and Amhara (27%), with ethnic clashes also involving Ethiopian Somalis (6%).

==Legislative branch==
The Federal Parliamentary Assembly has two chambers: the House of People&#x27;s Representatives (&quot;Yehizbtewekayoch Mekir Bet&quot;) with 547 members, elected for five-year terms in single-seat constituencies; and the House of the Federation (&quot;Yefedereshn Mekir Bet&quot;) with 112 members, one for each nationality, and one additional representative for each one million of its population, designated by the regional councils, which may elect them themselves or through popular elections.

==Judicial branch==

The president and vice president of the Federal Supreme Court are recommended by the prime minister and appointed by the House of People&#x27;s Representatives; for other federal judges, the prime minister submits candidates selected by the Federal Judicial Administrative Council to the House of People&#x27;s Representatives for appointment. In May 2007, the Ethiopian Federal courts received the Technology in Government in Africa (TIGA) award that is provided by Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the Canadian e-Policy Resource Center (CePRC).

With regard to the legal profession, although organizations such as the Ethiopian Lawyers&#x27; Association (formerly the Ethiopian Bar Association) and the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association (EWLA) are in existence, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups, such as women, have fared in the legal field.

==Executive branch==

|President
|Taye Atske Selassie
|Independent
|7 October 2024
|Prime Minister
|Abiy Ahmed

The House of People&#x27;s Representatives elects the president for a six-year term. The prime minister is designated by the party in power following legislative elections. The Council of Ministers, according to the 1995 constitution, consists of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, other Ministers and other members as determined and approved by the House of People&#x27;s Representatives. Among the ministries are the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of the Environment.

==Administrative divisions==

The states are: Afar; Amhara, Benishangul/Gumaz; Gambela; Harari; Oromia; Somali; South Ethiopia; Central Ethiopia; Tigray; Sidama; South West Ethiopia. The chartered cities are Addis Ababa, the country&#x27;s capital, and Dire Dawa.

== The Context of Public Management System Development in Ethiopia ==
The public management system in Ethiopia has undergone significant transformations throughout historical, cultural, and pollical contexts. all elements spontaneously impacted on the way public sector management has been structured and reformed in different periods of Ethiopian history.

=== Historical Context ===
The history of Ethiopia has played a pivotal role in shaping the country’s public management system. This evolution can be divided into three major periods:

==== &quot;The Monarchy Era (Haile Selassie) (1930–1974)&quot; ====
During this period, Ethiopia was ruled by the Emperor Haile Selassie. He introduced several initiatives to modernize the country&#x27;s public management system, such as:

* Enacting Ethiopia’s first constitution in 1931 (later revised in 1955).
* Establishing ministries, defining responsibilities, and delegating administrative authority.
* Support the creation of the Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union), which strengthened Ethiopia’s presence in international diplomacy.
* Founding the Imperial Institute of Public Administration (IIPA), later renamed the Central Personnel Agency (CPA) in 1961, which functioned as the central authority for setting and maintaining public service standards, overseeing job classifications, recruitment, and salary regulations for government employees.

The 1931 Constitution and its 1955 revision were the most significant factors shaping Ethiopia’s public management system during this period. These constitutions formally established the separation of powers into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. Additionally, a bicameral legislature was introduced, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House), whose members were indirectly elected by the people, and the Senate (Upper House), whose members were appointed by the emperor.

However, the constitution concentrated most executive power in the hands of the emperor, limiting the operation and independence of the public management system. As a result, Ethiopia’s governance functioned as a Centralized Autocracy, where the emperor retained key powers, including the appointment and dismissal of government officials and members of the national legislature, as well as the authority to draft, veto, and amend legislation, even after parliamentary approval. Additionally, he exercised control over the military, judiciary, and land distribution and held the power to appoint and approve high-ranking Christian religious leaders.

The public management system during this period faced several significant shortcomings, including:

* The direct adoption of foreign administrative structures without proper adaptation to Ethiopia’s unique context, which had local governance needs and autonomy demands of indigenous groups, resulting in a system that failed to address the country’s actual requirements. For example, the constitution was modeled after Japan and the UK, both monarchy regimes, and the civil servant salary system was based on the U.S. model.
* Decision-making was slow and bureaucratic, with all major policies requiring the emperor’s approval. This was particularly evident in the failure of land reform policies and the government&#x27;s inability to effectively address severe famines and droughts.
* A patronage system and widespread corruption, resulting from the emperor’s authoritative power over appointments and dismissals in government positions. This led to personnel selection based on loyalty rather than merit, causing a shortage of competent officials in the public sector.
* The citizen’s dissatisfaction and political opposition, which ultimately led to the suppression and violation by the government.

==== &quot;The Derg Regime (1974–1991)&quot; ====
Initially, the Derg regime adopted a socialist approach to national development, aiming to establish equality in access to resources and public services. Throughout its rule, the government implemented several mechanisms reflecting socialist principles in public sector management, including:

* The adoption of the National Democratic Revolution policy (NDR) in early 1976, aimed at abolishing feudalism and imperialism embedded in the public sector system under Haile Selassie.
* The nationalization and redistribution of all land and properties to establish a socialist-based economic structure, alongside the introduction of a collectivized agricultural system.
* The restructuring of administrative divisions, creating 25 administrative regions and five autonomous regions.
* The establishment of peasant and urban-dweller associations (kebeles), functioning as local-level administrative organizations responsible for governance and service delivery.
* The reform of financial and fiscal institutions, including the introduction of labor laws to regulate employment conditions.
* The expansion of the government workforce, increasing the number of state employees to approximately 200,000, double the size of the civil service under the previous regime, to accommodate the demands of the newly structured administration.

A key factor shaping the public management system during the Derg regime was Mengistu Haile Mariam’s adoption of Marxist-Leninist ideology in 1976 and his complete consolidation of power in 1977. This shift led to a governance system dominated by military rule, with no parliamentary structure or electoral processes. Although administrative decentralization was introduced through Kebeles, in practice, these local organizations lacked real authority as they remained strictly controlled by the central military government.

As a result, the Derg regime functioned as a Centralized Military Autocracy, with socialist ideology serving as a facade. Even when Mengistu introduced the 1987 Constitution to create the appearance of a civilian government, this further entrenched his monopoly on power. A clear example of this was the establishment of a unicameral legislature (National Shengo), where all members were elected exclusively through the Workers&#x27; Party of Ethiopia (WPE)—the sole legal party under Mengistu’s rule.

The public management system under the Derg regime resulted in several significant consequences, including:

* Inefficiency in administration: Despite expanding the number of government employees, the regime failed to realign ministerial functions with its new governance approach. Additionally, state operations were frequently disrupted by central government interference, leading to a shortage of competent employees, much like during the Haile Selassie era.
* Delays and failures in problem-solving: The collectivized agricultural system reduced productivity and contributed to severe famines. Furthermore, land and resources were unequally distributed, exacerbating poverty among ethnic groups.
* Lack of governance and public participation: Lack of check and balance system. The government ignored citizen needs and inclusion, such as enforcing Amharic as the sole official language, despite Ethiopia’s linguistic and ethnic diversity. It also restructured regional borders based on religion rather than ethnicity, and engaged in widespread political repression and mass killings of dissidents.

==== &quot;The Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) Era (1991–2019)&quot; ====
The EPRDF era marked a significant shift in Ethiopia’s public management system, moving away from the centralized military autocracy of the Derg towards a federal decentralized system. Following the overthrow of the Derg in 1991, the EPRDF-led transitional government implemented sweeping reforms aimed at restructuring governance, redefining the role of the state, and promoting ethnic federalism.

The EPRDF introduced several key reforms that shaped Ethiopia’s governance structure:

* Adoption of the 1995 Constitution, which restructured Ethiopia into an ethnic federalist state, granting regional governments autonomy over legislative, administrative, and fiscal affairs.
* Decentralization of governance, allowing regional states to establish their own constitutions and manage public services, taxation, and development projects.
* The expansion of the civil service sector, improving public sector management and increasing the workforce to accommodate the demands of a more decentralized system.
* Liberalization of the economy, shifting away from full state control by encouraging foreign investment and privatization while maintaining strong state intervention in key industries.

Despite the structural changes, public management under the EPRDF faced major obstacles:

* Weak institutional capacity at the regional level, as newly formed states lacked experienced personnel and administrative expertise.
* Political centralization within the EPRDF, where decision-making was still heavily influenced by the ruling coalition, limiting true autonomy of regional governments.
* Ethnic-based federalism fueling conflict, as territorial disputes and identity politics often led to inter-ethnic tensions and governance challenges.
* Suppression of opposition and civil liberties, as the government increasingly restricted political freedoms and dissent, particularly after the 2005 contested elections.

While the EPRDF’s decentralization reforms improved regional governance and economic growth, the system also exacerbated political fragmentation and instability. By the late 2010s, public dissatisfaction over governance inefficiencies, ethnic tensions, and political repression led to increasing calls for reform. In 2019, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed dissolved the EPRDF, transitioning Ethiopia into a new era of governance under the Prosperity Party, marking another turning point in Ethiopia’s public management evolution.

=== Cultural Context ===
culture have shaped Ethiopia’s public management system over time:

# &quot;Religion&quot; – Christianity has had a profound influence on governance. Under Haile Selassie, the emperor’s power was sanctified by the church, as he held the authority to approve religious leaders. This granted his rule divine legitimacy, limiting public scrutiny and strengthening his autocratic control. Similarly, during the Derg era, administrative divisions were drawn along religious boundaries rather than ethnic lines, leading to unequal resource allocation favoring Christian communities.
# &quot;Collectivism&quot; – Ethiopia’s collectivist culture, rooted in its ethnic diversity, has fostered an emphasis on coexistence and mutual respect. This cultural trait deeply influenced governance models, particularly ethnic federalism under the EPRDF, which aimed to institutionalize local autonomy and reflect the value of collective identity.
# &quot;Hierarchical society&quot; – Ethiopian society places strong importance on hierarchy and interpersonal relationships, reinforcing respect for leaders and discouraging direct confrontation with authority. This cultural trait often strengthened political elites, making it difficult to challenge leadership structures or introduce governance reforms that conflicted with existing power dynamics.

Political factors have significantly shaped Ethiopia’s public management system, often influencing governance structures, policy decisions, and administrative priorities. Two major political forces that shaped Ethiopia’s governance are foreign influence and war-driven governance strategies.

# &quot;Foreign Influence and Relations&quot; – Ethiopia’s public management system has been heavily influenced by external political and ideological forces, often leading to governance structures that struggled to fit the country’s unique context. During Haile Selassie regime, Great Britain influenced the regime to implement political and economic policies in order to get benefits back. During the Derg era, the regime aligned with the Soviet Union, receiving military aid, economic assistance, and ideological guidance. As a result, Ethiopia adopted Marxist-Leninist policies, including centralized economic planning and one-party rule, which reinforced bureaucratic inefficiencies and state-controlled governance. The global trend of modernization encouraged Ethiopia to develop its public management system by adopting models from various countries, such as structuring its constitution after Japan and the UK, or designing public administration structures based on the U.S. system. However, these externally influenced models often failed to align with Ethiopia’s socio-political realities, creating persistent challenges in implementing effective governance.
# &quot;War and Internal Conflicts&quot; – Prolonged wars and internal conflicts have significantly shaped Ethiopia’s governance and resource allocation. Throughout various regimes, wars have distorted government priorities, forcing leaders to divert resources toward military expenditure rather than national development. Under the Derg regime, conflicts such as the Ogaden War (1977–1978) with Somalia and multiple internal insurgencies intensified military centralization, as the government prioritized national security over administrative efficiency. Similarly, under the EPRDF, ethnic-based conflicts and border disputes led to governance fragmentation, where the central government oscillated between decentralization efforts and reasserting federal authority to maintain control. These conflicts have consistently reinforced military influence in public administration, often reducing civilian oversight and weakening institutional governance.

=== Summary: The Integrative Results of the Contextual Factors on Ethiopia’s Public Sector Management ===
The historical, cultural, and political contexts have collectively shaped Ethiopia’s public management system, influencing its governance structures, administrative efficiency, and policy decisions. From imperial centralization to military rule and ethnic federalism, Ethiopia’s public sector evolved in response to external influences, internal conflicts, and socio-political dynamics, demonstrating how these factors continuously interacted to define the country’s governance framework.

== Managing Internal Administrative Systems ==

=== Context ===
In the early 1990’s, a number of reforms to improve the public sector service in Ethiopia was introduced. The Public Service Reform Programme (PSRP) focused on key areas that impacted on how public services were provided to communities and individuals in Ethiopia. These key areas included:

* Civil Service reform – focused on how the civil service would provide services at a professional level including improving how civil servants would serve the public 
* Decentralisation - allocating administrative responsibilities from federal government to regional and local government – connecting locally with communities to provide public services
* Institutional structures &amp; governance – the three key areas that the Public Sector was organised into – Federal government; Regional governments; and Local governments to improve a more structured approach to provided public services.

=== Public Sector and Services working within the current Ethiopian Governance Structure ===
Ethiopia’s public sector consists of government institutions and organisations that manage public resources, implement policies and provide public services to those who need them. The system is organised based on the country’s federal system which includes federal, regional and local levels of government.

&quot;Federal government&quot;

* The Executive Branch: Led by the Prime Minister and includes the Council of Ministers. This branch is responsible for policy implementation and the day-to-day administration of government affairs.
* The Legislative Branch: Parliament consists of two chambers - the House of Peoples’ Representatives (the lower house) and the House of Federation (the upper house). These bodies are responsible for passing laws, approving budgets, and overseeing the executive.
* The Judicial Branch: Ethiopia’s judiciary is independent and includes federal courts responsible for adjudicating legal matters at the national level. The highest court is the Federal Supreme Court.
* Federal Institutions: Assorted government ministries and agencies implement specific functions like education, health, agriculture, and security. These institutions are headed by ministers or commissioners and manage public resources, policy implementation, and service delivery at the federal level.

&quot;Regional government&quot;

* Ethiopia is a federal state and divided into 12 regional states based on ethnicity. These regional states have a significant degree of autonomy and have their own regional governments. They are responsible for policy areas such as education and health, tailored to the specific needs of their populations.
* While regional states have considerable autonomy, the federal government plays a role in ensuring that the public service system across all regions, functions according to the country’s constitutional principles. The regional states are required to cooperate with the federal government on matters that have national importance, such as policy reforms, national development plans, and certain legal matters that affect all regions.
* The regions are each governed by a regional council whose members are directly elected to represent woredas (districts). Woredas in Ethiopia are the administrative districts or local government units within the regional states. Each woreda is responsible for local governance, administration, and service delivery to its population.

&quot;Local government&quot;

* The local governments (woredas and kebeles) are the smallest administrative units in this public sector structure. They implement policies and programmes from both the regional and federal governments. Local authorities are often held responsible by their respective regional governments, but they too, must follow federal policies.
* The structure of woredas is designed to bring government closer to the people, allowing for more localized decision-making and management. These serve as the key units for implementing government policies and programmes at the grassroots level.
* Ethiopia has over 800 woredas, each of which can be further divided into kebeles (at the local government level). Kebeles are like neighborhoods or villages, and they serve as the primary interface between the government and the local population.

=== Civil Servants ===
Civil servants in Ethiopia carry out government policies and provide public services. The public service system is organised into ministries, bureaus, and agencies. These are guided by civil service laws and regulations. The Ethiopian Civil Service Commission (CSC) oversees the public sector, ensuring it runs effectively. The CSC handles human resources, regulatory compliance, institutional development, and public sector reforms, playing a key role in improving governance and service delivery in Ethiopia.

The key areas that the CSC oversees for the Federal government; and provides advice and guidance to Regional and Local governments are:

&quot;Human Resource Management&quot; - responsible for overseeing the recruitment, placement, promotion, and career development of public servants at all levels of government (federal, regional, and local). This includes recruitment and selection where CSC establishes guidelines and systems for recruitment across ministries, agencies, and other public institutions. Promotion and career development to ensure clear career paths for civil servants are established. Training and capacity building – to enhance the skills and capabilities of public servants through professional training.

&quot;Regulation and Oversight&quot; &quot;–&quot; development of and enforcing policies, laws, and regulations governing the public service. This area ensures that public servants adhere to ethical standards, professional conduct, and legal requirements including the development and implementation of the Code of Conduct; and monitoring compliance to ensure the implementation of civil service laws and regulations, ensuring that institutions follow procedures for managing employees and their duties.

&quot;Institutional Capacity Building&quot; - working to enhance the institutional capacity of government agencies and ministries to better serve the public. This involves organisational development where government institutions are structured effectively and that human resources are managed in a way that maximises efficiency and impact. The CSC also looks after management of public sector reforms aimed at improving governance, efficiency and responsiveness to citizens’ needs.

&quot;Public Service Reform and Modernisation&quot; – the CSC plays a central role in leading efforts to modernise and reform Ethiopia’s public sector. These reforms might include improving administrative processes, implementing new technologies for service delivery, and ensuring that public services are more accountable to citizens.

&quot;Policy Development&quot; - contributing to the development of national policies related to public sector management, the CSC provides input on laws, regulations, and strategies related to the civil service, including labour laws and policies concerning public sector wages, benefits, and working conditions.

&quot;Dispute Resolution and Grievances&quot; - the CSC also has a role in addressing disputes and grievances within the civil service. It handles complaints from public employees, ensures fair treatment in the workplace, and can mediate conflicts between public servants and their employers.

&quot;Coordination with Other Entities&quot; – the CSC coordinates with other government agencies, regional civil service commissions, and stakeholders in implementing public sector reforms and policies. It also works with international organisations, development partners, and experts on civil service management.

&quot;Research and Data Collection&quot; – the CSC conducts research and data collection to better understand the functioning of the civil service, employee satisfaction, and areas that need improvement. This research informs policy decisions and helps guide reform efforts.

&quot;Promotion of Diversity and Inclusivity&quot; – as Ethiopia is such a diverse country, the CSC works to ensure that the civil service reflects the country’s diversity, promoting gender equality, ethnic inclusion, and equal opportunity for all Ethiopians in public service employment.

=== Summary ===
The Ethiopian Civil Service Commission is a central body tasked with ensuring the effective and efficient functioning of the public sector. It oversees human resource management, regulatory compliance, institutional development, and the implementation of public sector reforms. By playing a strategic role in the development and management of the workforce, the CSC contributes significantly to Ethiopia’s overall governance and service delivery.

Overall, Ethiopia’s public sector is structured to balance national unity with regional diversity and is aimed at addressing the country’s socio-economic challenges through a combination of centralised policy-making and decentralised administration.

== Managing Ethics and Integrity ==

=== Introduction ===
Ethiopia is a nation with a profound and ancient history, which shapes its approach to ethics and integrity. The country has never been colonised, fighting off two attempts by Italy to invade the nation which has led to the country’s diverse cultural fabric becoming deeply rooted. Ethiopia’s customs, religious practices, and ethnic identities present both opportunities and challenges in fostering ethical governance and conduct within the public sector. Understanding the role of culture and tradition, the institutional framework, and the ongoing challenges is essential in assessing Ethiopia’s progress toward strengthening ethical practices and integrity.

=== The role of culture and tradition on ethics and integrity ===
Ethiopia&#x27;s culture emphasises collectivism, where community welfare often takes precedence over individual interests. This collective orientation fosters cooperation, mutual aid, and a shared sense of responsibility, reinforcing ethical decision-making in both personal and professional spheres Communal values encourage ethical behaviour, emphasising collective problem-solving and prioritising community well-being. However, this strong sense of loyalty can also lead to nepotism and favouritism, where familial or ethnic ties influence decision-making, sometimes at the expense of broader institutional ethical standards. Such tendencies create tensions between traditional loyalty and the expectations of modern governance systems.

Oral traditions play a significant role in shaping ethics in Ethiopia. Storytelling serves as a primary method for passing down moral lessons across generations, with elders playing a key role in educating younger members about fairness, respect, and community responsibility. While effective in preserving cultural values, oral traditions can sometimes lead to informal and subjective approaches to ethical issues, particularly in formal institutional settings.

Religious and customary beliefs also play a crucial role in Ethiopia’s ethical framework. With a population practicing diverse faiths, including Christianity, Islam, and indigenous religions, values such as honesty, accountability, and reconciliation are deeply embedded in society. However, an overemphasis on reconciliation and forgiveness may result in subjective decision-making, particularly in community-based justice systems. For example, victims may face societal pressure to forgive offenders, even in cases of severe wrongdoing. This may lead to further harm being committed and to victims of offences being reluctant to report wrongdoing in the future. Additionally, religious and customary laws sometimes conflict with state laws, leading to inconsistencies in their application and in outcomes.

Ethiopia’s ethnic diversity adds another layer of complexity to its ethical landscape. With over 80 ethnic groups, perspectives on trust, reciprocity, and justice vary significantly. These differences can foster both unity and division, particularly within Ethiopia’s decentralised governance structures. While these variations may lead to disputes over resource allocation or political representation, they also offer opportunities for ethical enrichment by promoting respect for elders, communal responsibility, and integrity as foundational values.

=== Ethiopia’s Institutional Framework for Ethics and Integrity ===
Ethiopia has established several institutions to promote ethics, prevent corruption, and enforce accountability. The Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC), created in 2001, is the primary body responsible for addressing corruption. Its mandate includes overseeing asset disclosures by public officials, conducting public education campaigns, and investigating misconduct in the public sector. Despite its critical role, the FEACC faces significant challenges, including limited independence, resource constraints, and political interference. In a 2021 speech, Deputy Commissioner Wedo Atto highlighted these persistent issues and emphasised the need for international cooperation in combating corruption.

Ethiopia’s judiciary plays a crucial role in upholding ethics by enforcing anti-corruption laws. Key legislation includes the Ethiopian Penal Code, which addresses corruption and abuse of power, and the Freedom of Mass Media and Access to Information Proclamation, which promotes transparency. There is also the Proclamation to Provide for the Protection of Witnesses and Whistleblowers of Criminal offences (Proclamation 699/2010). This law establishes a framework for safeguarding individuals who report criminal activities.

Other public institutions contribute to promoting ethics, including the Office of the Federal Auditor General which audits public finances, the Civil Service Commission who oversees ethical conduct within government institutions and the Parliamentary Oversight Committees who monitor government activities to prevent and reduce misconduct.

==== Challenges in Upholding Ethics and Integrity ====
Ethiopia faces numerous challenges in maintaining ethics and integrity due to systemic corruption, limited institutional frameworks, and ongoing political and social conflicts. The civil war, particularly in the Tigray region, has severely impacted governance and ethical standards, eroding trust in state institutions. The breakdown of rule of law exacerbates ethnic tensions and polarises communities, undermining efforts to promote ethical governance. Reports also highlight mismanagement of aid and welfare relief during conflicts, exposing accountability gaps

A significant issue is the lack of comprehensive ethics training for public officials. While some institutions provide ethics education, there is a need for standardised and continuous training programs focused on integrity, transparency, and accountability. Without such efforts, ethical lapses may persist, further weakening institutional trust.

Corruption is particularly problematic in public procurement. Irregular payments, favouritism, and non-transparent bidding processes undermine accountability. Contracts are often awarded without due diligence, allowing corruption to flourish. Stricter enforcement of anti-corruption laws and increased transparency in public administration are necessary to address these issues.

Although the judiciary is constitutionally independent, political influence weakens its impartiality. Interference in judicial appointments diminishes public confidence in the judiciary’s ability to fairly adjudicate corruption cases. Similarly, the Freedom of Mass Media and Access to Information Proclamation, intended to promote transparency, suffers from weak enforcement. Delayed or incomplete public information releases hinder accountability efforts, highlighting the need for stronger implementation of transparency laws.

Decentralisation in Ethiopia, intended to promote local autonomy, has sometimes resulted in inconsistent ethical standards across regions. Some local governments struggle with oversight and accountability, enabling corruption and favouritism at the regional level. Strengthening governance mechanisms and standardising ethical policies across administrative levels are crucial for improving national integrity.

=== Conclusion ===
The relationship between culture, tradition, and ethics in Ethiopia presents both opportunities and challenges. While collective values, oral traditions, and religious principles provide a strong ethical foundation, issues such as nepotism, ethnic divisions, and informal decision-making continue to pose challenges for upholding and maintaining standards within the Ethiopian public service. Ethiopia’s institutional framework, including the FEACC and judiciary, provides mechanisms for fostering integrity, but political interference, resource limitations, and weak enforcement remain significant obstacles.

Addressing these issues requires strengthening institutions, enforcing anti-corruption measures, and promoting a culture of transparency and accountability. Enhancing ethics education, improving public sector training, and ensuring robust oversight mechanisms can help reinforce ethical standards and integrity within Ethiopia’s governance system.

== Managing Performance and Accountability ==
The Ethiopian government’s emphasis on performance management and accountability systems began in the early 1990s as part of a transformative agenda driven by political upheaval, institutional challenges, and strategic policy shifts. Following the overthrow of the military regime in 1991, the new government prioritized restoring state capacity and restructuring public institutions to ensure political stability and stimulate economic growth. In addition to political reforms, the government sought to address inefficiencies in its public service. Outdated bureaucratic systems, characterized by corruption and fragmented service delivery, struggled to meet the rising expectations of citizens. These efforts aligned with Ethiopia&#x27;s policy priorities, particularly its adoption of the &quot;Developmental State&quot; model in the early 1990s, reflected in the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP), which emphasized strengthening public institutions, mobilizing domestic resources, and combating corruption to achieve long-term developmental goals.

=== Performance Measurement System ===
Performance measurement gained prominence during the capacity-building phase with the introduction of the Result-Oriented Performance Appraisal System (ROPAS) in 2003. This initiative focused on enhancing the civil service&#x27;s capacity by setting formal performance targets agreed upon by both staff and supervisors. However, the implementation of ROPAS encountered challenges, including difficulties in identifying appropriate performance indicators, integrating institutional roles, and optimizing management and system capacities. Since 2004, the Ethiopian government has adopted performance management techniques within the framework of the New Public Management (NPM) approach, emphasizing public sector reform to achieve results through Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) and the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). Additionally, the Change Army, a uniquely Ethiopian approach, brings together political parties, civil servants, and public entities to foster strong teamwork and ensure a unified chain of command in public service delivery, all aligned with organizational goals.

==== Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) ====
The Ethiopian government introduced BPR as a management technique to improve service delivery performance by redesigning organizational structures, simplifying work processes, developing service standards, enhancing customer orientation in public services, and decentralizing tasks to lower levels of government. BPR has been implemented at the federal, regional, and woreda government levels in almost all public institutions, with criteria focused on efficiency, including time, quantity, quality, and cost. Studies indicate that BPR had a significant impact on the trade sector, consistent with its role in issuing licenses. For example, the cycle time for preparing facilities for fieldwork in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development was reduced from ten days to two hours.

==== Balanced Scorecard (BSC) ====
Since 2008, the Ethiopian government has used the BSC, which replaced ROPAS, by incorporating individual performance goals aligned with the country’s GTP and organizational targets derived from indicators such as financial management, public satisfaction levels, bureaucratic process efficiency, and employee competence. For example, the implementation of BSC in the Ethiopian Financial Sector by the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation (EIC) and the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) helped make reward practices more objective, clarified strategic direction, improved communication of strategic objectives, and encouraged learning and continuous improvement However, BSC has not been systematically implemented in all government institutions at the federal, regional, and local levels due to the lack of enhanced basic pay, performance incentives, training, and career paths. At the federal level, the system has only been fully implemented in 22 offices.

==== The Change Army ====
The Change Army has been integrated into the civil service since 2012, bringing together the party, civil servants, and the public to enhance efficiency and collective mobilization. The Party Wing focuses on building national consensus around the country’s development strategy, while the civil servants consist of five levels who discuss performance reports and resolve internal issues monthly. The highest level meets with the Public Wing quarterly to discuss strategic plans and their implementation. The Change Army is implemented more broadly at woreda and regional levels.

=== Accountability Mechanism ===
Ethiopia implements accountability mechanisms to promote transparency, fairness, and public trust through inter-organizational cooperation and citizen engagement.

==== Inter-Organizational ====

==== The Office of the Federal Auditor General (OFAG) ====
OFAG is responsible for ensuring accountability within the federal government by independently auditing and inspecting the accounts of ministries and other agencies, reporting findings and recommendations to the House of Peoples’ Representatives, and auditing accounts related to budgetary subsidies and special grants extended by the federal government to regional bodies. OFAG’s adherence to auditing standards and its scope of coverage in ensuring government accountability were demonstrated between 2008 and 2010, completing 100% of financial audits for the federal government.

==== The Ethiopian Institution of the Ombudsman (EIO) ====
EIO, was established in the year 1999, is responsible to ensure good government administration with quality, accountability and transparency by investigating maladministration based on complaints and recommending solutions and overseeing executive bodies to ensure compliance and prevent malpractice. The institution accommodates complaints through various channels, such as in-person visits, mail, telephone (both online and toll-free services), and email. Additionally, it reviews the source and credibility of complaints received via its social media platforms and strives to provide appropriate resolutions.

==== Citizen Engagement ====
Citizen engagement mechanisms empower individuals and communities to actively participate in governance processes including key programs:

* Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA): Citizens are engaged in the public budgeting process at federal, regional, and woreda administrative levels through budget literacy training and pre-budget forum discussions.
* Social Accountability (SA): This program involves citizens and civil society in developing joint action plans for basic public services such as education, health, agriculture, water, and sanitation. It includes workshops, training sessions, forum discussions, and interface meetings.
* The Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM): This mechanism enables citizens to report issues related to government services or projects, starting at the local kebele level and escalating to federal authorities, including the Ombudsman or courts when necessary.

=== Result-oriented Reforms ===
Performance management became a core component of NPM, focusing on shifting from measurement to management for results. Ethiopia&#x27;s result-oriented reforms focus on measurable outcomes in critical sectors.

==== Health Sector Transformation ====
The reform of health sector transformation has expanded universal health coverage, strengthened the healthcare workforce, and improved infrastructure. As a result, 43% of children were able to access anti-HIV treatment, and 63.8% of health centers were improved with clean water.

==== Education Quality Improvement ====
Reforms in education are focused on improving early education, training teachers, and enhancing support for students with special needs. These efforts have led to improvements in both enrollment rates and academic proficiency. For example, the G2/G1 enrollment ratio nationwide increased from 76% in 2016 to 88.6% in 2024. Additionally, the proficiency level in mathematics for Grade 8 students rose from 55% in 2019 to 60% in 2024.

== Policy and legislative processes ==
The Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (1995) (the Constitution) is the supreme law of Ethiopia and establishes the framework for the country’s governance, and the division of power and functions across the legislative, executive and judiciary branches.

At the federal level, the Executive branch, consisting of a Prime Minister and a Council of Ministers, are responsible for developing and implementing policies and federal budgets. Policies that require legislation are handed to the House of People’s Representatives to draft, consider and eventually pass the legislation. The House uses legislative committees to consider and improve draft legislation, and to facilitate public input into the legislative process.

Policies that do not require legislation or are not part of the federal budget can be developed and approved by the Council of Ministers. The House of People’s Representatives holds the Executive to account.

Overall, this is a similar model to New Zealand. In New Zealand, Cabinet is responsible for developing and implementing policies, and recommending national budgets and legislation to the House of Representatives. The House is independent of Cabinet and uses select committees to independently scrutinize and facilitate public input into draft legislation, and hold Cabinet to account via scrutiny weeks (led by the Governance and Administration Committee). However, unlike New Zealand, the House of People’s Representatives in Ethiopia tends to play a formal role and largely endorse policies proposed by the executive, with less active debate and shaping of the policy than legislature in other countries.

In Ethiopia public servants generally support the Council of Ministers (executive branch) but do provide some technical support to the House. This includes providing support to legislative committees during their consideration of draft legislation, to explain the policies and also provide technical support to the House during their consideration of the federal budget.

Under the Constitution regional states can make their own laws and policies, provided it is on a matter for the state and does not contradict federal policy. Regional states also have the ability to amend their constitutions. The structure for policy and law making at a regional level reflects that of the federal level, where the regional executives are responsible for developing most policies. As with the federal level, public servants who work for regional government tend to mostly support the Executive branch.

=== How policy making processes have changed over time ===
The way policies are made, and who makes them, has changed over time with Ethiopia’s political context.

&quot;Pre 1990s – Centralisation&quot;

Historically, before the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), Ethiopia had highly centralised decision making under monarchy and military governance, without much ability for citizens, political opponents, non-government organisations, or regional and local bodies to input into the policy or legislative process. There was little transparency on policies and decision making, and no formal process to debate or oppose policies.

&quot;1990s – Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front and the Constitution&quot;

In recent decades the shift towards democratic models of governance has led to greater devolution of policy making to the regions and districts. This started in the 1990s with the development of the Constitution, which led to both the emergence of regional states, and the introduction of standardised processes, roles and accountabilities in the policy making process at both federal and regional levels. The Constitution enabled significant devolution of some policy making to regions, and the ability for the regional states to make their own laws and design their own local government systems.

The development of the Constitution also marked increased public participation in policy making. Article 92 of the Constitution guarantees that ‘People have the right to full consultation and to the expression of views in the planning and implementations of environmental policies and projects that affect them directly’. Alongside this, the combination of standardised processes and greater policy making by regional states led to increased public participation in policy development.

&quot;2005 onwards – Public Sector Reform&quot;

Under regional constitutions, woreda (districts) are authorized to adopt and implement their own plans relating to social and economic development. The development of regional constitutions led to further devolution of decision-making and policy design to woreda, which in turn led to grass roots style public participation in policy development.

=== Differences in federal, regional and local policy making, and public input into policy making at different levels of government ===
Ethiopia has a hybrid system where there are aspirations of a developmental state model, within a federal system. This means that while there is now greater devolution of policy making to regions and districts, there continues to be a strong federal role in policy making.  In practice, federal, regional and local levels of government develop different types of policy, which reflect their distinct governing roles and purpose. For example, rural woredas are often important in the successful implementation of central or regional policies, due to their close connection to communities and ability to mobilize local resources to support social and economic development.

The different roles that federal, regional and local government play also lends to different ways in which citizens and interest groups can participate in the policy development process.

At the federal level, policies are focused on matters of national significance and apply universally to all citizens, such as security, foreign relations and human rights. The Federal Government is also responsible for setting overall social and economic development policies. Generally public participation in these types of policies is facilitated through legislative committees, or public consultations and hearings with ethnic group leaders.

At the regional level, policies tend to focus more on delivery of social services, law enforcement, and the unique culture and language of the region. Public participation is often done through public forums, and targeted engagement with community leaders.

At the district and local level, policies are focused on community level interests, such as public health, infrastructure programmes, and land certification. Public input is more grass roots style, with kebele held meetings, and targeted engagement with citizens who are impacted by the policy of interest.

==== &quot;Case study of a district level policy&quot; ====
Rural land certification is an important area of policy in Ethiopia, with about 63 percent of Ethiopia’s total employment is in the agriculture sector. About 12 million smallholder farming households account for around 95 percent of agricultural production, and 85 percent of all agricultural employment.

In the late 1990s the federal Government began a programme to document and register lands held by rural households. The programme was designed to increase tenure security and certify long-term use rights for rural households, which was expected to increase long-term investment in land, and in turn increase productivity.

While the programme had significant benefits, the mapping of land was completed at a very high level. This meant individual plots or boundary documentation were missed, and for smallholders, their land rights were not secured. In 2005, a United States Agency International Development funded programme worked with woreda to complete more granular land certification, and evaluated the impacts of this second level of land certification on smallholders.

The results showed a positive range of impacts for smallholder households. Smallholder households had a 10 percent increase in access to credit, and an 11 percent increase in tenure security. Notably there was a 10 percent increase in the likelihood of a wife possessing land in her name, and a 44 percent increase in a wife deciding which crops to grow on land in her possession. This case study highlights the contribution woreda make to implementing federal level policies, through their close connection to and knowledge of local communities.

=== Conclusion ===
In conclusion, Ethiopia’s policy making processes have undergone significant change over the last few decades, which reflects Ethiopia’s changing governance context. Devolution of some types of policy making to regions and districts has been a strong focus, along with increasing public input into policy making.

<text>Nankana Sahib (; ) is a city and capital of Nankana Sahib District in the Punjab province of Pakistan. It is named after the first Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Nanak, who was born in the city and first began preaching here. Nankana Sahib is among the most important religious sites for the Sikh religion. It is located about west of Lahore and about east of Faisalabad. According to the census of 2017 the city has a population of 110,135 inhabitants. Until 2005, it was a part of the Sheikhupura District.

== History ==
Originally, the locality was founded by a Hindu ruler named Raja Vairat and was originally named Raipur but it was destroyed during the Islamic invasions of the Indian subcontinent. A later, re-built township on the site of the first settlement was founded during the Delhi Sultanate rule by Rai Bhoi, a Rajput of Bhati stock whose Hindu ancestor had converted to Islam due to the influence of Sufism, and thus was known as Rai-Bhoi-Di-Talwandi. His great-grand son Rai Bular Bhatti, renamed it as &#x27;Nankana Sahib&#x27; after the birth of Guru Nanak. The Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, originally constructed by Sikhs during the Mughal era in around 1600 CE was renovated in 1819–20 CE by Gian-Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh The Sikh Conference of Panjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Peshawar, Kangra and Hazara.

During the Akali movement, on 20 February 1921, Narain Das, the Udasi mahant (clergy) of the gurdwara at Nankana Sahib, ordered his men to fire on Akali protesters, leading to the Nankana massacre. The firing was widely condemned, and an agitation was launched until the control of this historic Janam Asthan Gurdwara was restored to the Sikhs. Again in the 1930s and 1940s the Sikhs added more buildings and more architectural design.

==Geography==
Nankana Sahib and it surroundings were formerly a tehsil of Sheikhupura District. In May 2005, the provincial government raised the status of Nankana Sahib to a district as a way of promoting development in the area. The present status is District Nankana Sahib has three tehsils: Nankana Sahib, Shah Kot, and Sangla Hill. Before December 2008, District Nankana Sahib also included Safdarabad Tehsil.

There are plans to construct a university as well as hospitals and health care facilities by the district government with mutual interest of local communities and family of Rai Bular.

In 2007, the Pakistan government announced a plan to set up a university on Sikh religion and culture at Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak. Chairman of Pakistan&#x27;s Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), Gen (R) Zulfikar Ali Khan, said that &quot;The international Guru Nanak University planned at Nankana Sahib would have the best architecture, curricula and research centre on Sikh religion and culture&quot;.

<text>Kabir ( 15th century) was a well-known Indian devotional mystic poet and sant. His writings influenced Hinduism&#x27;s Bhakti movement, and his verses are found in Sikhism&#x27;s scripture Guru Granth Sahib, the Satguru Granth Sahib of Saint Garib Das, and Kabir Sagar of Dharamdas. Today, Kabir is an important figure in Hinduism, Sikhism and in Sufism. In his young age he was eager to get initiated by Self realized Sant Swami Ramanand and he succeeded in being one. His devotion towards his Guru made him to reach on the last destination of Self-realisation. 

Born in the city of Varanasi in what is now Uttar Pradesh, he is known for being critical of organized religions. He questioned what he regarded to be the meaningless and unethical practices of all religions, primarily what he considered to be the wrong practices in Hinduism and Islam. During his lifetime, he was threatened by both Hindus and Muslims for his views. When he died, several Hindus and the Muslims he had inspired claimed him as theirs.

Kabir suggested that &quot;truth&quot; is with the person who is on the path of righteousness, who considers everything, living and non living, as divine, and who is passively detached from the affairs of the world. To know the truth, suggested Kabir, drop the &quot;I&quot;, or the ego. Kabir&#x27;s legacy survives and continues through the Kabir panth (&quot;Path of Kabir&quot;), Sant Mat sect that recognizes Kabir as its founder. Its members are known as &quot;Kabir panthis&quot;.

==Early life and background==
The years of Kabir&#x27;s birth and death are uncertain. Some historians favor 1398–1448 as the period Kabir lived, while others favor 1440–1518. Generally, Kabir is believed to have been born in , on the full moon day of Jyeshtha month (according to the historical Hindu calendar Vikram Samvat) at the time of Brahmamuharta. There is a considerable scholarly debate on the circumstances surrounding Kabir&#x27;s birth. Many followers of Kabir believe that he came from &quot;Satloka&quot; by assuming the body of light, and incarnated on a lotus flower and claim that the rishi Ashtanand was the direct witness of this incident, who himself appeared on a lotus flower in the Lahartara Pond. 

A few accounts mention that Kabir, in the form of in infant, was found at Lahartara Lake by a Muslim weaver named Niru and his wife Nima, who raised him as their child.

Kabir is believed to have become one of the many disciples of the Bhakti poet-saint Swami Ramananda in Varanasi, known for devotional Vaishnavism with a strong bent to monist Advaita philosophy teaching that God was inside every person and everything. Early texts about his life place him with Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism as well as the Sufi tradition of Islam. According to Irfan Habib, the two manuscript versions of the Persian text &quot;Dabestan-e Mazaheb&quot; are the earliest known texts with biographical information about Kabir. The &quot;Dabestan-e-Mazaheb&quot; states Kabir is a &quot;Bairagi&quot; (Vaishnava yogi) and states he is a disciple of Ramanand (the text refers to him repeatedly as &quot;Gang&quot;). 

Kabir&#x27;s family is believed to have lived in the locality of Kabir Chaura in Varanasi (Banaras). &quot;Kabīr maṭha&quot; (), a &quot;maṭha&quot; located in the back alleys of Kabir Chaura, celebrates his life and times. Accompanying the property is a house named &quot;Nīrūṭīlā&quot; () which houses Niru and Nima graves.

==Poetry==
Kabir&#x27;s poems were in Sadhukkadi, also known as Panchmel Khichri, borrowing from various dialects including Khadi boli, Braj, Bhojpuri, and Awadhi. Kabir also wrote in pure Bhojpuri, for instance his poems like &quot;mor hīrā herāïl bā kichaṛe me&quot; is written in pure Bhojpuri. They cover various aspects of life and call for a loving devotion for God. Kabir composed his verses with simple words. Most of his work was concerned with devotion, mysticism and discipline.

Kabir and his followers named his verbally composed poems of wisdom as &quot;bāņīs&quot; (utterances). These include songs and couplets, called variously &quot;dohe&quot;, &quot;śalokā&quot; (Sanskrit: ślokā), or &quot;sākhī&quot; (Sanskrit: sākṣī). The latter term means &quot;witness&quot;, implying the poems to be evidence of the Truth.

Literary works with compositions attributed to Kabir include &quot;Kabir Bijak&quot;, &quot;Kabir Parachai&quot;, &quot;Sakhi Granth&quot;, &quot;Adi Granth&quot; (Sikh), and &quot;Kabir Granthawali&quot; (Rajasthan). However, except for Adi Granth, significantly different versions of these texts exist and it is unclear which one is more original; for example, &quot;Kabir Bijak&quot; exists in two major recensions. The most in depth scholarly analysis of various versions and translations are credited to Charlotte Vaudeville, the 20th century French scholar on Kabir.

There are 82 works attributed to Kabir as mentioned in Kabir and the Kabir panth by Westcott. Shyamsundar Das himself brought to light two marked manuscripts which he published in 1928. One of these manuscripts carried the date 1504 and the other 1824.

Kabir&#x27;s poems were verbally composed in the 15th century and transmitted &quot;viva voce&quot; through the 17th century. &quot;Kabir Bijak&quot; was compiled and written down for the first time in the 17th century. Scholars state that this form of transmission, over geography and across generations bred change, interpolation and corruption of the poems. Furthermore, whole songs were creatively fabricated and new couplets inserted by unknown authors and attributed to Kabir, not because of dishonesty but out of respect for him and the creative exuberance of anonymous oral tradition found in Indian literary works. Scholars have sought to establish poetry that truly came from Kabir and its historicity value.

===Authenticity===
Kabir&#x27;s poems can be found in a wide variety of publications and websites, but the discussion of authenticity is ongoing. It seems certain that minor changes will have occurred through the centuries and it is also possible that poems written by others have been attributed to Kabir.

Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s English translation and compilation, &quot;Songs of Kabir&quot;, was first published in 1915 and has been a classic reprinted and circulated particularly in the West. One critic (V.C. Mishra) has gone so far as to suggest that only six of its hundred poems are authentic and also raises the question of whether the translator projected theological perspectives of the early 20th century onto Kabir. The same essay adds that the presumed unauthentic poems nevertheless belong to the Bhakti movement in medieval India and may have been composed by admirers of Kabir who lived later.

===Philosophy===

According to Linda Hess, &quot;Some modern commentators have tried to present Kabir as a synthesizer of Hinduism and Islam; but the picture is a false one. While drawing on various traditions as he saw fit, Kabir emphatically declared his independence from both the major religions of his countrymen, vigorously attacked what he considered the follies of these religions, and tried to kindle the fire of a similar autonomy and courage in those who claimed to be his disciples. He adopted their terminology and concepts, but vigorously criticized them both. He questioned the need for any holy book, as stated in Kabir Granthavali as follows:


Many scholars interpret Kabir&#x27;s philosophy to be questioning the need for religion, rather than attempting to propose either Hindu–Muslim unity or an independent synthesis of a new religious tradition. Kabir rejected the hypocrisy and misguided rituals evident in various religious practices of his day, including those in Islam and Hinduism.

In &quot;Bijak&quot;, Kabir mocks the practice of praying to avatars such as Buddha of Buddhism, by asserting &quot;don&#x27;t call the master Buddha, he didn&#x27;t put down devils&quot;. Kabir urged people to look within and consider all human beings as manifestation of God&#x27;s living forms:

Charlotte Vaudeville states that the philosophy of Kabir and other sants of the Bhakti movement is the seeking of the Absolute. The notion of this Absolute is &quot;nirguna&quot; which, writes Vaudeville, is same as &quot;the Upanishadic concept of the Brahman-Atman and the monistic Advaita interpretation of the Vedantic tradition, which denies any distinction between the soul [within a human being] and God, and urges man to recognize within himself his true divine nature&quot;. Vaudeville notes that this philosophy of Kabir and other Bhakti sants is self-contradictory, because if God is within, then that would be a call to abolish all external bhakti. This inconsistency in Kabir&#x27;s teaching may have been differentiating &quot;union with God&quot; from the concept of &quot;merging into God, or Oneness in all beings&quot;. Alternatively, states Vaudeville, the &quot;saguna&quot; prema-bhakti (tender devotion) may have been prepositioned as the journey towards self-realization of the &quot;nirguna&quot; Brahman, a universality beyond monotheism.

David N. Lorenzen and Adrián Muñoz trace these ideas of God in Kabir&#x27;s philosophy as &quot;nirguna Brahman&quot; to those in Adi Shankara&#x27;s theories on Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism, albeit with some differences.

===Influence of Islam===
Lorenzen in his review of Kabir&#x27;s philosophy and poetry writes, &quot;the extent to which Kabir borrowed elements from Islam is controversial. Many recent scholars have argued that he simply rejected Islam and took almost all his ideas and beliefs from the Hindu tradition. Contemporary Kabir Panth sadhus make roughly the same argument. Most of the vocabulary used in his songs and verses are borrowed directly from the Hindu tradition. 
Some scholars state that the sexual imagery in some of Kabir&#x27;s poems reflect a mystic Sufi Islam influence, wherein Kabir inverts the traditional Sufi representation of a God-woman and devotee-man longing for a union, and instead uses the imagery of Lord-husband and devotee-bride. Other scholars, in contrast, state that it is unclear if Sufi ideas influenced Bhakti sants like Kabir or it was vice versa, suggesting that they probably co-developed through mutual interaction.

Kabir left Islam, states Ronald McGregor. Kabir, nevertheless, criticized practices such as killing and eating cows by Muslims, in a manner Hindus criticized those practices:

===Persecution and social impact===
Kabir&#x27;s couplets suggest he was persecuted for his views, while he was alive. He stated, for example,

Kabir response to persecution and slander was to welcome it. He called the slanderer a friend, expressed gratefulness for the slander, for it brought him closer to his God. Winand Callewaert translates a poem attributed to Kabir in the warrior-ascetic &quot;Dadupanthi&quot; tradition within Hinduism, as follows:

The legends about Kabir describe him as the underdog who nevertheless is victorious in trials by a Sultan, a Brahmin, a Qazi, a merchant, a god or a goddess. The ideological messages in the legends appealed to the poor and oppressed. According to David Lorenzen, legends about Kabir reflect a &quot;protest against social discrimination and economic exploitation&quot;, they present the perspective of the poor and powerless, not the rich and powerful. However, many scholars doubt that these legends of persecution are authentic, point to the lack of any corroborating evidence, consider it unlikely that a Muslim Sultan would take orders from Hindu Brahmins or Kabir&#x27;s own mother demanded that the Sultan punish Kabir, and question the historicity of the legends on Kabir.

==Legacy==
Kabir literature legacy was promoted by two of his disciples, Bhāgodās and Dharamdas. Songs of Kabir were collected by Kshitimohan Sen from mendicants across India, these were then translated to English by Rabindranath Tagore.

New English translations of Songs of Kabir is done by Arvind Krishna Mehrotra. August Kleinzahler writes about this: &quot;It is Mehrotra who has succeeded in capturing the ferocity and improvisational energy of Kabir’s poetry&quot;.

Kabir&#x27;s legacy continues to be carried forward by the Kabir panth (&quot;Path of Kabir&quot;), a religious community that recognises him as its founder and is one of the Sant Mat sects. This community was founded centuries after Kabir died, in various parts of India, over the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Its members, known as &quot;Kabir panthis&quot;, are estimated to be around 9.6 million. They are spread over north and central India, as well as dispersed with the Indian diaspora across the world, up from 843,171 in the 1901 census.

There are two temples dedicated to Kabir located in Benares. One of them is maintained by Hindus, while the other by Muslims. Both the temples practise similar forms of worship where his songs are sung daily. Other rituals of aarti and distributing prasad are similar to other Hindu temples. The followers of Kabir are vegetarians and abstain from alcohol.

===Kabir, Guru Nanak and the Guru Granth Sahib===

Kabir&#x27;s verses were incorporated into Adi Granth, the scripture of Sikhism, with verses attributed to Kabir constituting the largest non-Sikh contribution.

Some scholars state Kabir&#x27;s ideas were one of the many influences on Guru Nanak, who went on to found Sikhism in the fifteenth century. Other Sikh scholars disagree, stating there are differences between the views and practices of Kabir and Nanak.

Harpreet Singh, quoting Hew McLeod, states, &quot;In its earliest stage Sikhism was clearly a movement within the Hindu tradition; Nanak was raised a Hindu and eventually belonged to the Sant tradition of northern India, a movement associated with the noted poet and mystic Kabir.&quot; Surjit Singh Gandhi disagrees, and writes, &quot;Guru Nanak in his thought pattern as well as in action model was fundamentally different from Kabir and for that matter other radical Bhaktas or saints (saint has been erroneously used for such Bhaktas by McLeod). Hence to consider Kabir as an influence on Guru Nanak is wrong, both historically and theologically&quot;.

McLeod places Guru Nanak in the Sant tradition that included Kabir and states that their fundamental doctrines were reproduced by Guru Nanak. JS Grewal contests this view and states that McLeod&#x27;s approach is limiting in its scope because, &quot;McLeod takes into account only concepts, ignores practices altogether, he concentrates on similarities and ignores all differences&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Neeraj Arya&#x27;s Kabir Cafe marries Kabir&#x27;s couplets with contemporary music adding elements of rock, Karnatic, and folk. Popular renderings include &#x27;Halke Gaadi Haanko&#x27;, Chadariya Jhini and Chor Awega. Kabir Cafe claims that living their lives just as Kabir suggests has led to them experiencing some of these truths and it reflects in their performances. 

Noted classical singer, late Kumar Gandharva, is well recognized for his renderings of Kabir&#x27;s poetry.

Documentary filmmaker Shabnam Virmani, from the Kabir Project, has produced a series of documentaries and books tracing Kabir&#x27;s philosophy, music and poetry in present-day India and Pakistan. The documentaries feature Indian folk singers such as Prahlad Tipanya, Mukhtiyar Ali and the Pakistani Qawwal Fareed Ayaz. Kabir festival was organized in Mumbai, India in 2017.

The album No Stranger Here by Shubha Mudgal, Ursula Rucker draws heavily from Kabir&#x27;s poetry. Kabir&#x27;s poetry has appeared prominently in filmmaker Anand Gandhi&#x27;s films &quot;Right Here Right Now&quot; (2003) and Continuum. Pakistani Sufi singer Abida Parveen has sung Kabir in a full album.

A music album titled Kabeera - The Thinker, by Indo-Canadian Vandana Vishwas features some of the selected Kundaliyaan and rare poems penned by Kabeer Das in a contemporary musical arrangement.

==Criticism==
Kabir has been criticised for his depiction of women. Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh states, &quot;Kabir&#x27;s opinion of women is contemptuous and derogatory&quot;. Wendy Doniger concludes Kabir had a misogynist bias. Schomer states that for Kabir, woman is &quot;&quot;kali nagini&quot; (a black cobra), &quot;kunda naraka ka&quot; (the pit of hell), &quot;juthani jagata ki&quot; (the refuse of the world)&quot;. According to Kabir, a woman prevents man&#x27;s spiritual progress.

In contrast to Singh&#x27;s interpretation of Kabir&#x27;s gender views, Dass interprets &quot;Rag Asa&quot; section of Adi Granth as Kabir asking a young married woman to stop veiling her face, and not to adopt such social habits. Dass adds that Kabir&#x27;s poetry can be interpreted in two ways, one literally where the woman refers to human female, another allegorically where woman is symbolism for his own soul and &quot;Rama&quot; is the Lord-husband.

<text>The Priory Church of Saint Mary, Bushmead, commonly called Bushmead Priory, was a monastic foundation for Augustinian Canons, located at Bushmead (a hamlet in Staploe parish) in the County of Bedfordshire in England. It is a Grade I listed building.

==Description==
The remains of the 700-year-old priory stand today neighbouring a light industrial estate, and disused airfield, and lie between the villages of Colmworth and Little Staughton. Nothing survives of the priory church, and all but the refectory and kitchen of the claustral buildings have disappeared.

Never a large house, the community appears to have consisted of the prior and up to four canons.

The priory was founded around 1195 by William, Chaplain of Colmworth. Hugh de Beauchamp of Eaton Socon endowed the priory with 28 acres (113,000 m2), the priory also held land around Coppingford chapel; during these early years it also held a considerable number of Selions, given to them by local people as gifts of faith. Around 1206 King John permitted the monks to enclose and clear part of the nearby Perry woods.

After William&#x27;s death in 1215, Joseph, Chaplain of Coppingford, became head of the fraternity. Under his guidance the house became an Augustinian priory. The Augustinians, were then a comparatively new order, which ordained priests, but lived in community similar in style to monks.

Throughout the following years the priory prospered through gifts and grants. The monks wrote documents illustrating their daily lives, these became books of charters, called Cartularies. Unfortunately through the centuries very few of these charters have survived.

It was common for monastic orders at this time to be the beneficiaries of generous donations. However, it was equally common for disapproving heirs to object to the size of these gifts donated from their potential estates. One such heir was John Pateschull, unhappy at a bequest of £8 per annum in the will of his grandfather, after a dispute lasting many years, he had had the priory&#x27;s cattle seized. Richard of Staughton, a senior Canon and later prior of Bushmead, called the bailiff and set out to recover them. The senior Canon was seized by John Pateschull&#x27;s men and imprisoned. The dispute was finally ended through arbitration.

When Richard of Staughton became prior, he obtained permission from the bishop to form a boys&#x27; school; however it is thought he died of the Black Death before the project could be implemented.

The prior in 1418 was Robert Tychemerssh.

Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII, the ownership of Bushmead Priory became the subject of a dispute between the St. John family of Bletsoe and Sir William Gascoigne of Cardington, the latter being Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s controller of the household. He had previously exchanged land with King Henry VIII and sought further recompense. The King waited until 1537, almost a year after the priory&#x27;s dissolution, before allowing the priory to pass to Sir William.

Fifteen years later, in 1562, a Cambridgeshire man, William Gery, purchased the estate and almost immediately began building on the site of the priory. Around a hundred years later Richard Gery extended the site and formed a mansion (since demolished). There have obviously been many changes to the priory. A new floor, and fenestration (in the lower section) were fitted circa 1500, although only the rafters now remain. Clearly visible, though, are the major and various subsequent minor alterations, giving an interesting insight into its architectural history.

It is a rare example of King post, and timber frame roof architecture.

The site is now in the care of English Heritage and is open to the public at weekends during Spring and Summer.

<text>Maya (; Devanagari: , IAST: ), literally &quot;illusion&quot; or &quot;magic&quot;, has multiple meanings in Indian philosophies depending on the context. In later Vedic texts, connotes a &quot;magic show, an illusion where things appear to be present but are not what they seem&quot;; the principle which shows &quot;attributeless Absolute&quot; as having &quot;attributes&quot;. also connotes that which &quot;is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal&quot; (in opposition to an unchanging Absolute, or Brahman), and therefore &quot;conceals the true character of spiritual reality&quot;. 

In the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, , &quot;appearance&quot;, is &quot;the powerful force that creates the cosmic illusion that the phenomenal world is real&quot;. In this nondualist school, at the individual level appears as the lack of knowledge () of the real Self, &quot;Atman-Brahman&quot;, mistakenly identifying with the body-mind complex and its entanglements.

In Buddhist philosophy, is one of twenty subsidiary unwholesome mental factors, responsible for deceit or concealment about the illusionary nature of things. 

In Vaishnavism, Māyā is an epithet, or a manifestation of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, who with Vishnu are together revered as the personification of the Absolute. Māyā was also the name of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s mother.

==Etymology and terminology==
&quot;Māyā&quot; (Sanskrit: ), a word with unclear etymology, probably comes from the root &quot;mā&quot; which means &quot;to measure&quot;.

According to Monier Williams, &quot;māyā&quot; meant &quot;wisdom and extraordinary power&quot; in an earlier older language, but from the Vedic period onwards, the word came to mean &quot;illusion, unreality, deception, fraud, trick, sorcery, witchcraft and magic&quot;. However, P. D. Shastri states that the Monier Williams&#x27; list is a &quot;loose definition, misleading generalization&quot;, and not accurate in interpreting ancient Vedic and medieval era Sanskrit texts; instead, he suggests a more accurate meaning of &quot;māyā&quot; is &quot;appearance, not mere illusion&quot;.

According to William Mahony, the root of the word may be &quot;man-&quot; or &quot;to think&quot;, implying the role of imagination in the creation of the world. In early Vedic usage, the term implies, states Mahony, &quot;the wondrous and mysterious power to turn an idea into a physical reality&quot;.

Franklin Southworth states the word&#x27;s origin is uncertain, and other possible roots of &quot;māyā&quot; include &quot;may-&quot; meaning mystify, confuse, intoxicate, delude, as well as &quot;māy-&quot; which means &quot;disappear, be lost&quot;.

Jan Gonda considers the word related to &quot;mā&quot;, which means &quot;mother&quot;, as do Tracy Pintchman and Adrian Snodgrass, serving as an epithet for goddesses such as Lakshmi and Durga.

A similar word is also found in the Avestan &quot;māyā&quot; with the meaning of &quot;magic power&quot;.

Maya can refer to one or more types of illusion:
# illusion of the permanence of this world. Everything, including cells, humans, and stars, follow their own cycle of death &amp; rebirth. 
# illusion that each individual is independent from the world/ecosystem. Reality is, a living being is a facet of God experiencing other facets (living beings). This Ecosystem includes farmers, bus/train drivers, shopkeepers, software engineers, etc. who are all inter-dependent. 
# illusion that our ever-evolving desires can be satisfied. We desire something and feel that we will be happy if that desire is fulfilled. But, when it is fulfilled, we desire something else. 

==Hinduism==
===Literature===
====The Vedas====
Words related to and containing &quot;Māyā&quot;, such as &quot;Mayava&quot;, occur many times in the Vedas. These words have various meanings, with interpretations that are contested, and some are names of deities that do not appear in texts of 1st millennium BCE and later. The use of word Māyā in Rig Veda, in the later era context of &quot;magic, illusion, power&quot;, occurs in many hymns. One titled Māyā-bheda (मायाभेद:, Discerning Illusion) includes hymns 10.177.1 through 10.177.3, as the battle unfolds between the good and the evil, as follows,

The above Maya-bheda hymn discerns, using symbolic language, a contrast between mind influenced by light (sun) and magic (illusion of Asura). The hymn is a call to discern one&#x27;s enemies, perceive artifice, and distinguish, using one&#x27;s mind, between that which is perceived and that which is unperceived. Rig Veda does not connote the word Māyā as always good or always bad, it is simply a form of technique, mental power and means. Rig Veda uses the word in two contexts, implying that there are two kinds of Māyā: divine Māyā and undivine Māyā, the former being the foundation of truth, the latter of falsehood.

Elsewhere in Vedic mythology, Indra uses Maya to conquer Vritra. Varuna&#x27;s supernatural power is called Maya. &quot;Māyā&quot;, in such examples, connotes powerful magic, which both &quot;devas&quot; (gods) and &quot;asuras&quot; (demons) use against each other. In the Yajurveda, &quot;māyā&quot; is an unfathomable plan. In the Aitareya Brahmana Maya is also referred to as Dirghajihvi, hostile to gods and sacrifices. The hymns in Book 8, Chapter 10 of Atharvaveda describe the primordial woman &quot;Virāj&quot; (, chief queen) and how she willingly gave the knowledge of food, plants, agriculture, husbandry, water, prayer, knowledge, strength, inspiration, concealment, charm, virtue, vice to gods, demons, men and living creatures, despite all of them making her life miserable. In hymns of 8.10.22, &quot;Virāj&quot; is used by Asuras (demons) who call her as Māyā, as follows,

The contextual meaning of Maya in Atharva Veda is &quot;power of creation&quot;, not illusion. Gonda suggests the central meaning of Maya in Vedic literature is, &quot;wisdom and power enabling its possessor, or being able itself, to create, devise, contrive, effect, or do something&quot;. Maya stands for anything that has real, material form, human or non-human, but that does not reveal the hidden principles and implicit knowledge that creates it. An illustrative example of this in Rig Veda VII.104.24 and Atharva Veda VIII.4.24 where Indra is invoked against the Maya of sorcerers appearing in the illusory form – like a &quot;fata morgana&quot; – of animals to trick a person.

====The Upanishads====

The Upanishads describe the universe, and the human experience, as an interplay of Purusha (the eternal, unchanging principles, consciousness) and Prakṛti (the temporary, changing material world, nature). The former manifests itself as Ātman (Soul, Self), and the latter as Māyā. The Upanishads refer to the knowledge of Atman as &quot;true knowledge&quot; (&quot;Vidya&quot;), and the knowledge of Maya as &quot;not true knowledge&quot; (&quot;Avidya&quot;, Nescience, lack of awareness, lack of true knowledge). Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, states Ben-Ami Scharfstein, describes Maya as &quot;the tendency to imagine something where it does not exist, for example, atman with the body&quot;. To the Upanishads, knowledge includes empirical knowledge and spiritual knowledge, complete knowing necessarily includes understanding the hidden principles that work, the realization of the soul of things.

Hendrick Vroom explains, &quot;The term &quot;Maya&quot; has been translated as &#x27;illusion,&#x27; but then it does not concern normal illusion. Here &#x27;illusion&#x27; does not mean that the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. &quot;Maya&quot; means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned.&quot; Lynn Foulston states, &quot;The world is both real and unreal because it exists but is &#x27;not what it appears to be&#x27;.&quot; According to Wendy Doniger, &quot;to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge.&quot;

Māyā pre-exists and co-exists with Brahman – the Ultimate Principle, Consciousness. Maya is perceived reality, one that does not reveal the hidden principles, the true reality. Maya is unconscious, Atman is conscious. Maya is the literal, Brahman is the figurative &quot;Upādāna&quot; – the principle, the cause. Maya is born, changes, evolves, dies with time, from circumstances, due to invisible principles of nature, state the Upanishads. Atman-Brahman is eternal, unchanging, invisible principle, unaffected absolute and resplendent consciousness. Maya concept in the Upanishads, states Archibald Gough, is &quot;the indifferent aggregate of all the possibilities of emanatory or derived existences, pre-existing with Brahman&quot;, just like the possibility of a future tree pre-exists in the seed of the tree.

The concept of Maya appears in numerous Upanishads. The verses 4.9 to 4.10 of Svetasvatara Upanishad, is the oldest explicit occurrence of the idea that Brahman (Supreme Soul) is the hidden reality, nature is magic, Brahman is the magician, human beings are infatuated with the magic and thus they create bondage to illusions and delusions, and for freedom and liberation one must seek true insights and correct knowledge of the principles behind the hidden magic. Gaudapada in his Karika on Mandukya Upanishad explains the interplay of Atman and Maya as follows,

Sarvasara Upanishad refers to two concepts: &quot;Mithya&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot;. It defines &quot;Mithya&quot; as illusion and calls it one of three kinds of substances, along with Sat (Be-ness, True) and Asat (not-Be-ness, False). &quot;Maya&quot;, Sarvasara Upanishad defines as all what is not Atman. Maya has no beginning, but has an end. Maya, declares Sarvasara, is anything that can be studied and subjected to proof and disproof, anything with Guṇas. In the human search for Self-knowledge, Maya is that which obscures, confuses and distracts an individual.

====The Puranas and Tamil texts====

In Puranas and Vaishnava theology, &quot;māyā&quot; is described as one of the nine shaktis of Vishnu. &quot;Māyā&quot; became associated with sleep; and Vishnu&#x27;s &quot;māyā&quot; is sleep which envelopes the world when he awakes to destroy evil. Vishnu, like Indra, is the master of &quot;māyā&quot;; and &quot;māyā&quot; envelopes Vishnu&#x27;s body. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; narrates that the sage Markandeya requests Vishnu to experience his &quot;māyā&quot;. Vishnu appears as an infant floating on a fig leaf in a deluge and then swallows the sage, the sole survivor of the cosmic flood. The sage sees various worlds of the universe, gods etc. and his own hermitage in the infant&#x27;s belly. Then the infant breathes out the sage, who tries to embrace the infant, but everything disappears and the sage realizes that he was in his hermitage the whole time and was given a flavor of Vishnu&#x27;s &quot;māyā&quot;. The magic creative power, &quot;Māyā&quot; was always a monopoly of the central Solar God; and was also associated with the early solar prototype of Vishnu in the early Aditya phase.

The basic grammar of the third and final Tamil Sangam is &quot;Tholkappiyam&quot; composed by &quot;Tholkappiyar&quot;, who according to critics is referred as Rishi Jamadagni&#x27;s brother &quot;Sthiranadumagni&quot; and uncle of Parshurama. He categorically uses a Prakrit (Tamil:Pagatham) Tadbhava &quot;Mayakkam&quot;, which is the root of the word Maya(m). He says that the entire creation is a blurred flow between State of matter or &quot;Pancha Bhutas&quot;. This concept of Maya is of the school of Agastya, who was the first Tamil grammarian and the guru of Tholkappiyar.

In Sangam period Tamil literature as well as the later hymns of the Tamil Alvars, Krishna and Narayana are found as &quot;Māyon&quot;; with other attributed names are such as Mal, Tirumal, Perumal and Mayavan. In the Tamil classics, Durga is referred to by the feminine form of the word, viz., &quot;māyol&quot;; wherein she is endowed with unlimited creative energy and the great powers of Vishnu, and is hence &quot;Vishnu-Maya&quot;.

Maya, to Shaiva Siddhanta sub-school of Hinduism, states Hilko Schomerus, is reality and truly existent, and one that exists to &quot;provide Souls with &quot;Bhuvana&quot; (a world), &quot;Bhoga&quot; (objects of enjoyment), &quot;Tanu&quot; (a body) and &quot;Karana&quot; (organs)&quot;.

===Schools of Hinduism===
====Need to understand Māyā====
The various schools of Hinduism, particularly those based on naturalism (Vaiśeṣika), rationalism (Samkhya) or ritualism (Mimamsa), questioned and debated what is Maya, and the need to understand Maya. The Vedanta and Yoga schools explained that complete realization of knowledge requires both the understanding of ignorance, doubts and errors, as well as the understanding of invisible principles, incorporeal and the eternal truths. In matters of Self-knowledge, stated Shankara in his commentary on Taittiriya Upanishad, one is faced with the question, &quot;Who is it that is trying to know, and how does he attain Brahman?&quot; It is absurd, states Shankara, to speak of one becoming himself; because &quot;Thou Art That&quot; already. Realizing and removing ignorance is a necessary step, and this can only come from understanding Maya and then looking beyond it.

The need to understand Maya is like the metaphorical need for road. Only when the country to be reached is distant, states Shankara, that a road must be pointed out. It is a meaningless contradiction to assert, &quot;I am right now in my village, but I need a road to reach my village.&quot; It is the confusion, ignorance and illusions that need to be repealed. It is only when the knower sees nothing else but his Self that he can be fearless and permanent. Vivekananda explains the need to understand Maya as follows (abridged),

The text Yoga Vasistha explains the need to understand Maya as follows,

====Samkhya school====
The early works of Samkhya, the rationalist school of Hinduism, do not identify or directly mention the Maya doctrine. The discussion of Maya theory, calling it into question, appears after the theory gains ground in Vedanta school of Hinduism. Vācaspati Miśra&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Samkhyakarika&quot;, for example, questions the Maya doctrine saying &quot;It is not possible to say that the notion of the phenomenal world being real is false, for there is no evidence to contradict it&quot;. Samkhya school steadfastly retained its duality concept of Prakrti and Purusha, both real and distinct, with some texts equating Prakrti to be Maya that is &quot;not illusion, but real&quot;, with three Guṇas in different proportions whose changing state of equilibrium defines the perceived reality.

James Ballantyne, in 1885, commented on Kapila&#x27;s Sánkhya aphorism 5.72 which he translated as, &quot;everything except nature and soul is uneternal&quot;. According to Ballantyne, this aphorism states that the mind, ether, etc. in a state of cause (not developed into a product) are called Nature and not Intellect. He adds, that scriptural texts such as Shvetashvatara Upanishad to be stating &quot;He should know Illusion to be Nature and him in whom is Illusion to be the great Lord and the world to be pervaded by portions of him&#x27;; since Soul and Nature are also made up of parts, they must be uneternal&quot;. However, acknowledges Ballantyne, Edward Gough translates the same verse in Shvetashvatara Upanishad differently, &#x27;Let the sage know that Prakriti is Maya and that Mahesvara is the Mayin, or arch-illusionist. All this shifting world is filled with portions of him&#x27;. In continuation of the Samkhya and Upanishadic view, in the Bhagavata philosophy, Maya has been described as &#x27;that which appears even when there is no object like silver in a shell and which does not appear in the atman&#x27;; with maya described as the power that creates, maintains and destroys the universe.

====Nyaya school====
The realism-driven Nyaya school of Hinduism denied that either the world (Prakrti) or the soul (Purusa) are an illusion. Naiyayikas developed theories of illusion, typically using the term &quot;Mithya&quot;, and stated that illusion is simply flawed cognition, incomplete cognition or the absence of cognition. There is no deception in the reality of Prakrti or &quot;Pradhana&quot; (creative principle of matter/nature) or Purusa, only confusion or lack of comprehension or lack of cognitive effort, according to Nyaya scholars. To them, illusion has a cause, that rules of reason and proper &quot;Pramanas&quot; (epistemology) can uncover.

Illusion, state Naiyayikas, involves the projection into current cognition of predicated content from memory (a form of rushing to interpret, judge, conclude). This &quot;projection illusion&quot; is misplaced, and stereotypes something to be what it is not. The insights on theory of illusion by Nyaya scholars were later adopted and applied by Advaita Vedanta scholars.

====Yoga school====
Maya in Yoga school is the manifested world and implies divine force. Yoga and Maya are two sides of the same coin, states Zimmer, because what is referred to as Maya by living beings who are enveloped by it, is Yoga for the Brahman (Universal Principle, Supreme Soul) whose yogic perfection creates the Maya. Maya is neither illusion nor denial of perceived reality to the Yoga scholars, rather Yoga is a means to perfect the &quot;creative discipline of mind&quot; and &quot;body-mind force&quot; to transform Maya.

The concept of Yoga as power to create Maya has been adopted as a compound word &quot;Yogamaya&quot; (योगमाया) by the theistic sub-schools of Hinduism. It occurs in various mythologies of the Puranas; for example, Shiva uses his &quot;yogamāyā&quot; to transform Markendeya&#x27;s heart in Bhagavata Purana&#x27;s chapter 12.10, while Krishna counsels Arjuna about &quot;yogamāyā&quot; in hymn 7.25 of Bhagavad Gita.

====Vedanta schools====
Maya is a prominent and commonly referred to concept in Vedanta philosophies. It is a complex concept in Vedanta philosophy, and its interpretation varies among different Vedanta schools.

Vishishtadvaita Vedanta does have a concept that resembles Maya, referred to as &quot;Prakriti&quot;, and its nature and role within the philosophy differ significantly from the concept of Maya. &quot;Prakriti&quot; is considered real and is integral to the creative process of the universe within the framework of Vishishtadvaita. 

===== Dvaita =====
In Dvaita Vedanta, Maya is considered the power or energy of God. While Advaita considers the world to be a manifestation of Maya and thus illusory, Dvaita sees the world as real and a creation of God (Vishnu). Each school&#x27;s perspective on Maya influences its understanding of the nature of reality and the path to liberation. Unlike the Vishishtadvaita and Advaita schools, the Dvaita school does not attribute the difference between God, souls, and the universe, to maya.

===== Advaita =====
In Advaita Vedanta philosophy, there are two realities: &quot;Vyavaharika&quot; (empirical reality) and &quot;Paramarthika&quot; (absolute, spiritual reality). Māyā is the empirical reality that entangles consciousness. Māyā has the power to create a bondage to the empirical world, preventing the unveiling of the true, unitary Self – the Cosmic Spirit also known as Brahman. The theory of māyā was developed by the ninth-century Advaita Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara. However, competing theistic Dvaita scholars contested Shankara&#x27;s theory, and stated that Shankara did not offer a theory of the relationship between Brahman and Māyā. A later Advaita scholar Prakasatman addressed this, by explaining, &quot;Maya and Brahman together constitute the entire universe, just like two kinds of interwoven threads create a fabric. Maya is the manifestation of the world, whereas Brahman, which supports Maya, is the cause of the world.&quot;

Māyā is a fact in that it is the appearance of phenomena. Since Brahman is the sole metaphysical truth, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Since Māyā is the perceived material world, it is true in perception context, but is &quot;untrue&quot; in spiritual context of Brahman. Māyā is not false, it only clouds the inner Self and principles that are real. True Reality includes both &quot;Vyavaharika&quot; (empirical) and &quot;Paramarthika&quot; (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize Brahman, realize the fearless, resplendent Oneness.

Vivekananda said: &quot;When the Hindu says the world is Maya, at once people get the idea that the world is an illusion. This interpretation has some basis, as coming through the Buddhistic philosophers, because there was one section of philosophers who did not believe in the external world at all. But the Maya of the Vedanta, in its last developed form, is neither Idealism nor Realism, nor is it a theory. It is a simple statement of facts – what we are and what we see around us.&quot;

==Buddhism==
Māyā (Sanskrit; Tibetan wyl.: &quot;sgyu&quot;) is a Buddhist term translated as &quot;pretense&quot; or &quot;deceit&quot; that is identified as one of the twenty subsidiary unwholesome mental factors within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings. In this context, it is defined as pretending to exhibit or claiming to have a good quality that one lacks.

The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: 

What is deceit? It is a display of what is not a real quality and is associated with both passion-lust (raga) and bewilderment-erring (moha) by being overly attached to wealth and honor. Its function is to provide a basis for a perverse life-style.

Alexander Berzin explains:

Pretension (sgyu) is in the categories of longing desire (raga) and naivety (which is in essence lack of experience) (moha). Because of excessive attachment to our material gain and the respect we receive, and activated by wanting to deceive others, pretension is pretending to exhibit or claiming to have a good quality that we lack.

The Early Buddhist Texts contain some references to illusion, the most well known of which is the &quot;Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta&quot; in Pali (and with a Chinese Agama parallel at SĀ 265) which states:

Suppose, monks, that a magician (māyākāro) or a magician’s apprentice (māyākārantevāsī) would display a magical illusion (māyaṃ) at a crossroads. A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder, and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void (rittaka), hollow (tucchaka), coreless (asāraka). For what core (sāro) could there be in a magical illusion (māyāya)? So too, monks, whatever kind of cognition there is, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a monk inspects it, ponders it, and carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to be void (rittaka), hollow (tucchaka), coreless (asāraka). For what core (sāro) could there be in cognition?

One sutra in the Āgama collection known as &quot;Mahāsūtras&quot; of the (Mūla)Sarvāstivādin tradition entitled the &quot;Māyājāla&quot; (Net of Illusion) deals especially with the theme of Maya. This sutra only survives in Tibetan translation and compares the five aggregates with further metaphors for illusion, including: an echo, a reflection in a mirror, a mirage, sense pleasures in a dream and a madman wandering naked.

These texts give the impression that māyā refers to the insubstantial and essence-less nature of things as well as their deceptive, false and vain character.

Later texts such as the Lalitavistara also contain references to illusion:

The Salistamba Sutra also puts much emphasis on illusion, describing all dharmas as being “characterized as illusory” and “vain, hollow, without core”. Likewise the Mahāvastu, a highly influential Mahāsāṃghikan text on the life of the Buddha, states that the Buddha “has shown that the aggregates are like a lightning flash, as a bubble, or as the white foam on a wave.”

&quot;For that which we cannot see, feel, smell, touch, or understand, we do not believe. For this, we are merely fools walking on the grounds of great potential with no comprehension of what is.&quot;Buddhist monk quotation

===Theravada===
In Theravada Buddhism &#x27;Māyā&#x27; is the name of the mother of the Buddha as well as a metaphor for the consciousness aggregate (&quot;viññana&quot;). The Theravada monk Bhikkhu Bodhi considers the Pali &quot;Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta&quot; “one of the most radical discourses on the empty nature of conditioned phenomena.” Bodhi also cites the Pali commentary on this sutra, the &quot;Sāratthappakāsinī&quot; (Spk), which states:

Cognition is like a magical illusion (māyā) in the sense that it is insubstantial and cannot be grasped. Cognition is even more transient and fleeting than a magical illusion. For it gives the impression that a person comes and goes, stands and sits, with the same mind, but the mind is different in each of these activities. Cognition deceives the multitude like a magical illusion (māyā).

Likewise, Bhikkhu Katukurunde Nyanananda Thera has written an exposition of the &quot;Kàlakàràma Sutta&quot; which features the image of a magical illusion as its central metaphor.

===Sarvastivada===
The &quot;Nyānānusāra Śāstra&quot;, a Vaibhāṣika response to Vasubandhu&#x27;s Abhidharmakosha, cites the &quot;Māyājāla sutra&quot; and explains:

“Seeing an illusory object (māyā)”: Although what one apprehends is unreal, nothing more than an illusory sign. If one does not admit this much, then an illusory sign should be non-existent. What is an illusory sign? It is the result of illusion magic. Just as one with higher gnosis can magically create forms, likewise this illusory sign does actually have manifestation and shape. Being produced by illusion magic, it acts as the object of vision. That object which is taken as really existent is in fact ultimately non-existent. Therefore, this [Māyājāla] Sūtra states that it is non-existent, due to the illusory object there is a sign but not substantiality. Being able to beguile and deceive one, it is known as a “deceiver of the eye.”

===Mahayana===
In Mahayana sutras, illusion is an important theme of the Prajñāpāramitā sutras. Here, the magician&#x27;s illusion exemplifies how people misunderstand and misperceive reality, which is in fact empty of any essence and cannot be grasped. The Mahayana uses similar metaphors for illusion: magic, a dream, a bubble, a rainbow, lightning, the moon reflected in water, a mirage, and a city of celestial musicians.&quot; Understanding that what we experience is less substantial than we believe is intended to serve the purpose of liberation from ignorance, fear, and clinging. Facilitating the attainment of enlightenment as a Buddha completely dedicated to the welfare of all beings. The Prajñaparamita texts also state that all dharmas (phenomena) are like an illusion, not just the five aggregates, but all beings, including Bodhisattvas and even Nirvana. The &quot;Prajñaparamita-ratnaguna-samcayagatha&quot; (Rgs) states:

And also:

According to Ven. Dr. Huifeng, what this means is that Bodhisattvas see through all conceptualizations and conceptions, for they are deceptive and illusory, and sever or cut off all these cognitive creations.

Depending on the stage of the practitioner, the magical illusion is experienced differently. In the ordinary state, we get attached to our own mental phenomena, believing they are real, like the audience at a magic show gets attached to the illusion of a beautiful lady. At the next level, called actual relative truth, the beautiful lady appears, but the magician does not get attached. Lastly, at the ultimate level, the Buddha is not affected one way or the other by the illusion. Beyond conceptuality, the Buddha is neither attached nor non-attached. This is the middle way of Buddhism, which explicitly refutes the extremes of both eternalism and nihilism.

Nāgārjuna&#x27;s Madhyamaka philosophy discusses &quot;nirmita&quot;, or illusion closely related to māyā. In this example, the illusion is a self-awareness that is, like the magical illusion, mistaken. For Nagarjuna, the self is not the organizing command center of experience, as we might think. Actually, it is just one element combined with other factors and strung together in a sequence of causally connected moments in time. As such, the self is not substantially real, but neither can it be shown to be unreal. The continuum of moments, which we mistakenly understand to be a solid, unchanging self, still performs actions and undergoes their results. &quot;As a magician creates a magical illusion by the force of magic, and the illusion produces another illusion, in the same way the agent is a magical illusion and the action done is the illusion created by another illusion.&quot; What we experience may be an illusion, but we are living inside the illusion and bear the fruits of our actions there. We undergo the experiences of the illusion. What we do affects what we experience, so it matters. In this example, Nagarjuna uses the magician&#x27;s illusion to show that the self is not as real as it thinks, yet, to the extent it is inside the illusion, real enough to warrant respecting the ways of the world.

For the Mahayana Buddhist, the self is māyā like a magic show and so are objects in the world. Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Trisvabhavanirdesa&quot;, a Mahayana Yogacara &quot;Mind Only&quot; text, discusses the example of the magician who makes a piece of wood appear as an elephant. The audience is looking at a piece of wood but, under the spell of magic, perceives an elephant instead. Instead of believing in the reality of the illusory elephant, we are invited to recognize that multiple factors are involved in creating that perception, including our involvement in dualistic subjectivity, causes and conditions, and the ultimate beyond duality. Recognizing how these factors combine to create what we perceive ordinarily, ultimate reality appears. Perceiving that the elephant is illusory is akin to seeing through the magical illusion, which reveals the dharmadhatu, or ground of being.

===Tantra===
Buddhist Tantra, a further development of the Mahayana, also makes use of the magician&#x27;s illusion example in yet another way. In the completion stage of Buddhist Tantra, the practitioner takes on the form of a deity in an illusory body (māyādeha), which is like the magician&#x27;s illusion. It is made of wind, or prana, and is called illusory because it appears only to other yogis who have also attained the illusory body. The illusory body has the markings and signs of a Buddha. There is an impure and a pure illusory body, depending on the stage of the yogi&#x27;s practice.

In the Dzogchen tradition the &quot;perceived reality&quot; is considered literally unreal, in that objects which make-up perceived reality are known as objects within one&#x27;s mind, and that, &quot;as we conceive them&quot;, there is no pre-determined object, or assembly of objects in isolation from experience that may be considered the &quot;true&quot; object, or objects. As a prominent contemporary teacher puts it: &quot;In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream [...]&quot;. In this context, the term &quot;visions&quot; denotes not only visual perceptions, but appearances perceived through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations.

Different schools and traditions in Tibetan Buddhism give different explanations of the mechanism producing the illusion usually called &quot;reality&quot;.

Even the illusory nature of apparent phenomena is itself an illusion. Ultimately, the yogi passes beyond a conception of things either existing or not existing, and beyond a conception of either samsara or nirvana. Only then is the yogi abiding in the ultimate reality.

==Jainism==

&quot;Maya&quot;, in Jainism, means appearances or deceit that prevents one from &quot;Samyaktva&quot; (right belief). Maya is one of three causes of failure to reach right belief. The other two are &quot;Mithyatva&quot; (false belief) and &quot;Nidana&quot; (hankering after fame and worldly pleasures).

&quot;Maya&quot; is a closely related concept to &quot;Mithyatva&quot;, with Maya a source of wrong information while Mithyatva an individual&#x27;s attitude to knowledge, with relational overlap.

Svetambara Jains classify categories of false belief under &quot;Mithyatva&quot; into five: &quot;Abhigrahika&quot; (false belief that is limited to one&#x27;s own scriptures that one can defend, but refusing to study and analyze other scriptures); &quot;Anabhigrahika&quot; (false belief that equal respect must be shown to all gods, teachers, scriptures); &quot;Abhiniviseka&quot; (false belief resulting from pre-conceptions with a lack of discernment and refusal to do so); &quot;Samsayika&quot; (state of hesitation or uncertainty between various conflicting, inconsistent beliefs); and &quot;Anabhogika&quot; (innate, default false beliefs that a person has not thought through on one&#x27;s own).

Digambara Jains classify categories of false belief under &quot;Mithyatva&quot; into seven: &quot;Ekantika&quot; (absolute, one sided false belief), &quot;Samsayika&quot; (uncertainty, doubt whether a course is right or wrong, unsettled belief, skepticism), &quot;Vainayika&quot; (false belief that all gods, gurus and scriptures are alike, without critical examination), &quot;Grhita&quot; (false belief derived purely from habits or default, no self-analysis), &quot;Viparita&quot; (false belief that true is false, false is true, everything is relative or acceptable), &quot;Naisargika&quot; (false belief that all living beings are devoid of consciousness and cannot discern right from wrong), &quot;Mudha-drsti&quot; (false belief that violence and anger can tarnish or damage thoughts, divine, guru or dharma).

&quot;Māyā&quot; (deceit) is also considered one of four &quot;Kaṣaya&quot; (faulty passion, a trigger for actions) in Jain philosophy. The other three are &quot;Krodha&quot; (anger), &quot;Māna&quot; (pride) and &quot;Lobha&quot; (greed). The ancient Jain texts recommend that one must subdue these four faults, as they are source of bondage, attachment and non-spiritual passions.

==Sikhism==

In Sikhism, the world is regarded as both transitory and relatively real. God is viewed as the only reality, but within God exist both conscious souls and nonconscious objects; these created objects are also real. Natural phenomena are real but the effects they generate are unreal. māyā is as the events are real yet māyā (Gurmukhi: ਮਾਇਆ) is not as the effects are unreal. Sikhism believes that people are trapped in the world because of five vices: lust, anger, greed, attachment, and ego. Maya enables these five vices and makes a person think the physical world is &quot;real,&quot; whereas, the goal of Sikhism is to rid the self of them. Consider the following example: In the moonless night, a rope lying on the ground may be mistaken for a snake. We know that the rope alone is real, not the snake. However, the failure to perceive the rope gives rise to the false perception of the snake. Once the darkness is removed, the rope alone remains; the snake disappears.

* &quot;Sakti adher jevarhee bhram chookaa nihchal siv ghari vaasaa.&quot;In the darkness of māyā, I mistook the rope for the snake, but that is over, and now I dwell in the eternal home of the Lord.(Sri Guru Granth Sahib 332).
* &quot;Raaj bhuiang prasang jaise hahi ab kashu maram janaaiaa.&quot;Like the story of the rope mistaken for a snake, the mystery has now been explained to me. Like the many bracelets, which I mistakenly thought were gold; now, I do not say what I said then. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib 658).

In some mythologies the symbol of the snake was associated with money, and māyā in modern Punjabi refers to money. However, in the Guru Granth Sahib māyā refers to the &quot;grand illusion&quot; of materialism. From this māyā all other evils are born, but by understanding the nature of māyā a person begins to approach spirituality.

* &quot;Janam baritha jāṯ rang mā▫i▫ā kai. ||1|| rahā▫o.&quot;You are squandering this life uselessly in the love of māyā.Sri Guru Granth Sahib M.5 Guru Arjan Dev ANG 12

The teachings of the Sikh Gurus push the idea of seva (selfless service) and simran (prayer, meditation, or remembering one&#x27;s true death). The depths of these two concepts and the core of Sikhism comes from sangat (congregation): by joining the congregation of true saints one is saved. By contrast, most people are believed to suffer from the false consciousness of materialism, as described in the following extracts from the Guru Granth Sahib:

* &quot;Mā▫i▫ā mohi visāri▫ā jagaṯ piṯā parṯipāl.&quot;In attachment to māyā, they have forgotten the Father, the Cherisher of the World.Sri Guru Granth Sahib M3 Guru Amar Das ANG 30
* &quot;Ih sarīr mā▫i▫ā kā puṯlā vicẖ ha▫umai ḏustī pā▫ī.&quot;This body is the puppet of māyā. The evil of egotism is within it.Sri Guru Granth Sahib M3 Guru Amar Das
* &quot;Bābā mā▫i▫ā bẖaram bẖulā▫e.&quot;O Baba, māyā deceives with its illusion.Sri Guru Granth Sahib M1 Guru Nanak Dev ANG 60

<text>A biological hazard, or biohazard, is a biological substance that poses a threat (or is a hazard) to the health of living organisms, primarily humans. This could include a sample of a microorganism, virus or toxin that can adversely affect human health. A biohazard could also be a substance harmful to other living beings.

The term and its associated symbol are generally used as a warning, so that those potentially exposed to the substances will know to take precautions. The biohazard symbol was developed in 1966 by Charles Baldwin, an environmental-health engineer working for the Dow Chemical Company on their containment products. It is used in the labeling of biological materials that carry a significant health risk, including viral samples and used hypodermic needles. In Unicode, the biohazard symbol is U+2623 (☣).

==ANSI Z535/OSHA/ISO regulation==
Biohazardous safety issues are identified with specified labels, signs and paragraphs established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Today, ANSI Z535 standards for biohazards are used worldwide and should always be used appropriately within ANSI Z535 Hazardous Communications (HazCom) signage, labeling and paragraphs. The goal is to help workers rapidly identify the severity of a biohazard from a distance and through colour and design standardization.

Biological hazard symbol design:
* A red on white or white-coloured background is used behind a black biohazard symbol when integrated with a DANGER sign, label or paragraph.
* An orange on black or white-coloured background is used behind a black biohazard symbol when integrated with a WARNING sign, label or paragraph.
* A yellow on black or white-coloured background is used behind a black biohazard symbol when integrated with a CAUTION sign, label or paragraph.
* A green on white or white-coloured background is used behind a black biohazard symbol when integrated with a NOTICE sign, label or paragraph.

DANGER is used to identify a biohazard that will cause death. WARNING is used to identify a biohazard that may cause death. CAUTION is used to identify a biohazard that will cause injury, but not death. NOTICE is used to identify a non-injury biohazard message (e.g. hygiene, cleanup or general lab policies).

OSHA requires the use of proper ANSI HazCom where applicable in American workplaces. States and local governments also use these standards as codes and laws within their own jurisdictions. Proper use of ANSI Z535 signs, labels and paragraphs are written into many of OSHA&#x27;s standards for HazCom and crafted to integrate with ISO symbols.

Reference ANSI Z535 for a complete description on how to use DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION and NOTICE signs, labels or paragraphs.

==UN/ISO Classification==
Biohazardous agents are classified for transportation by UN number:
* Category A, UN 2814 – Infectious substance, affecting humans: An infectious substance in a form capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs.
* Category A, UN 2900 – Infectious substance, affecting animals (only): An infectious substance that is not in a form generally capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans and animals when exposure to themselves occurs.
* Category B, UN 3373 – Biological substance transported for diagnostic or investigative purposes.
* Regulated Medical Waste, UN 3291 – Waste or reusable material derived from medical treatment of an animal or human, or from biomedical research, which includes the production and testing.

== Levels of biohazard ==

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) categorizes various diseases in levels of biohazard, Level 1 being minimum risk and Level 4 being extreme risk. Laboratories and other facilities are categorized as BSL (Biosafety Level) 1–4 or as &quot;P1&quot; through &quot;P4&quot; for short (Pathogen or Protection Level).
* Biohazard Level 1: Bacteria and viruses including &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;, canine hepatitis, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, and varicella (chickenpox), as well as some cell cultures and non-infectious bacteria. At this level precautions against the biohazardous materials in question are minimal, most likely involving gloves and some sort of facial protection.
* Biohazard Level 2: Bacteria and viruses that cause only mild disease to humans, or are difficult to contract via aerosol in a lab setting, such as hepatitis A, B, and C, some influenza A strains, Human respiratory syncytial virus, Lyme disease, salmonella, mumps, measles, scrapie, dengue fever, and HIV. Routine diagnostic work with clinical specimens can be done safely at Biosafety Level 2, using Biosafety Level 2 practices and procedures. Research work (including co-cultivation, virus replication studies, or manipulations involving concentrated virus) can be done in a BSL-2 (P2) facility, using BSL-3 practices and procedures.
* Biohazard Level 3: Bacteria and viruses that can cause severe to fatal disease in humans, but for which vaccines or other treatments exist, such as anthrax, West Nile virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A H5N1, hantaviruses, Cholera, tuberculosis, typhus, Rift Valley fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, yellow fever, and malaria.
* Biohazard Level 4: Viruses that cause severe to fatal disease in humans, and for which vaccines or other treatments are &quot;not&quot; available, such as Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, Marburg virus, Ebola virus, Lassa fever virus, Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, and other hemorrhagic diseases, as well as Nipah virus. Variola virus (smallpox) is an agent that is worked with at BSL-4 despite the existence of a vaccine, as it has been eradicated and thus the general population is no longer routinely vaccinated. When dealing with biological hazards at this level, the use of a positive pressure personnel suit with a segregated air supply is mandatory. The entrance and exit of a Level Four biolab will contain multiple showers, a vacuum room, an ultraviolet light room, autonomous detection system, and other safety precautions designed to destroy all traces of the biohazard. Multiple airlocks are employed and are electronically secured to prevent doors from both opening at the same time. All air and water service going to and coming from a Biosafety Level 4 (P4) lab will undergo similar decontamination procedures to eliminate the possibility of an accidental release. Currently there are no bacteria classified at this level.

<text>Louis XIII (; sometimes called the Just; 27 September 1601 – 14 May 1643) was King of France from 1610 until his death in 1643 and King of Navarre (as Louis II) from 1610 to 1620, when the crown of Navarre was merged with the French crown.

Shortly before his ninth birthday, Louis became king of France and Navarre after his father Henry IV was assassinated. His mother, Marie de&#x27; Medici, acted as regent during his minority. Mismanagement of the kingdom and ceaseless political intrigues by Marie and her Italian favourites led the young king to take power in 1617 by exiling his mother and executing her followers, including Concino Concini, the most influential Italian at the French court.

Louis XIII, taciturn and suspicious, relied heavily on his chief ministers, first Charles d&#x27;Albert, duc de Luynes and then Cardinal Richelieu, to govern the Kingdom of France. The King and the Cardinal are remembered for establishing the &quot;Académie française&quot;, and ending the revolt of the French nobility. They systematically destroyed the castles of defiant lords, and denounced the use of private violence (dueling, carrying weapons, and maintaining private armies). By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu had established &quot;the royal monopoly of force&quot; as the ruling doctrine. The king&#x27;s reign was also marked by the struggles against the Huguenots and Habsburg Spain.

==Early life, 1601–1610==
Born at the Palace of Fontainebleau, Louis XIII was the eldest child of King Henry IV of France and his second wife Marie de&#x27; Medici. As son of the king, he was a Fils de France (&quot;son of France&quot;), and as the eldest son, Dauphin of France. His father Henry IV was the first French king of the House of Bourbon, having succeeded his second cousin, Henry III (1574–1589), in application of Salic law. Louis XIII&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Antoine de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme, and Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, Queen of Navarre. His maternal grandparents were Francesco I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany. Eleonora de&#x27; Medici, his maternal aunt, was his godmother. As a child, he was raised under the supervision of the royal governess Françoise de Montglat.

The ambassador of King James I of England to the court of France, Sir Edward Herbert, who presented his credentials to Louis XIII in 1619, remarked on Louis&#x27;s extreme congenital speech impediment and his double teeth:
==Regency of Marie de&#x27; Medici, 1610–1617==
Louis XIII ascended the throne in 1610 upon the assassination of his father, and his mother Marie de&#x27; Medici acted as his Regent. Although Louis XIII came of age at thirteen (1614), his mother did not give up her position as Regent until 1617, when he was 16. Marie maintained most of her husband&#x27;s ministers, with the exception of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was unpopular in the country. She mainly relied on Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy, Noël Brûlart de Sillery, and Pierre Jeannin for political advice. Marie pursued a moderate policy, confirming the Edict of Nantes. She was not, however, able to prevent rebellion by nobles such as Henri, Prince of Condé (1588–1646), second in line to the throne after Marie&#x27;s second surviving son Gaston, Duke of Orléans. Condé squabbled with Marie in 1614, and briefly raised an army, but he found little support in the country, and Marie was able to raise her own army. Nevertheless, Marie agreed to call an Estates General assembly to address Condé&#x27;s grievances.

The assembly of this Estates General was delayed until Louis XIII formally came of age on his thirteenth birthday. Although his coming-of-age formally ended Marie&#x27;s Regency, she remained the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of France. The Estates General accomplished little, spending its time discussing the relationship of France to the Papacy and the venality of offices, but reaching no resolutions.

Beginning in 1615, Marie came to rely increasingly on Concino Concini, an Italian who assumed the role of her favourite, and was widely unpopular because he was a foreigner. This further antagonised Condé, who launched another rebellion in the early months of 1616. Huguenot leaders supported Condé&#x27;s rebellion, which led the young Louis XIII to conclude that they would never be loyal subjects. Eventually, Condé and Queen Marie made peace with the ratification on 3 May of the Treaty of Loudun, which allowed Condé great power in government but did not remove Concini. However, on 1 September, after growing dissatisfaction from nobles due to Concini&#x27;s position, Queen Marie, with Louis&#x27;s help, imprisoned Condé to protect Concini, leading to renewed revolts against the Queen and Concini.

In the meantime, Louis XIII decided, with the encouragement of Charles d&#x27;Albert (the Grand Falconer of France) and other advisers, to break with his mother and to arrest Concini. On 24 April 1617, during the attempted arrest, Concini was killed. His widow Leonora Dori Galigaï was tried for witchcraft, condemned, beheaded, and burned on 8 July 1617, and Marie was sent into exile in Blois. Later, Louis conferred the title of Duke of Luynes on Charles d&#x27;Albert.

==Ascendancy of Charles de Luynes, 1617–1621==
Luynes soon became as unpopular as Concini had been. Other nobles resented his monopolisation of the King. Luynes was seen as less competent than Henry IV&#x27;s ministers, many now elderly or deceased, who had surrounded Marie de&#x27; Medici.

The Thirty Years&#x27; War broke out in 1618. The French court was initially unsure of which side to support. On the one hand, France&#x27;s traditional rivalry with the House of Habsburg argued in favour of intervening on behalf of the Protestant powers (and Louis&#x27;s father Henry IV of France had once been a Huguenot leader). On the other hand, Louis XIII had a strict Catholic upbringing, and his natural inclination was to support the Holy Roman Emperor, the Habsburg Ferdinand II.

The French nobles were further antagonised against Luynes by the 1618 revocation of the &quot;paulette tax&quot; and by the sale of offices in 1620. From her exile in Blois, Marie de&#x27; Medici became the obvious rallying point for this discontent, and the Bishop of Luçon (who became Cardinal Richelieu in 1622) was allowed to act as her chief adviser, serving as a go-between Marie and the King.

French nobles launched a rebellion on 2 July 1620, but their forces were easily routed by royal forces at the Battle of Ponts-de-Cé on 7 August 1620. Louis then launched an expedition against the Huguenots of Béarn who had defied a number of royal decisions. This expedition managed to re-establish Catholicism as the official religion of Béarn. However, the Béarn expedition drove Huguenots in other provinces into a rebellion led by Henri, Duke of Rohan.

In 1621 Louis XIII was formally reconciled with his mother. Luynes was appointed Constable of France, after which he and Louis set out to quell the Huguenot rebellion. The siege at the Huguenot stronghold of Montauban had to be abandoned after three months owing to the large number of royal troops who had succumbed to camp fever. One of the victims of camp fever was Luynes, who died in December 1621.

==Rule by council, 1622–1624==
Following the death of Luynes, Louis determined that he would rule by council. His mother returned from exile and, in 1622, entered this council, where Condé recommended violent suppression of the Huguenots. The 1622 campaign, however, followed the pattern of the previous year: royal forces won some early victories, but were unable to complete a siege, this time at the fortress of Montpellier.

The rebellion was ended by the Treaty of Montpellier, signed by Louis XIII and the Duke of Rohan in October 1622. The treaty confirmed the tenets of the Edict of Nantes: several Huguenot fortresses were to be razed, but the Huguenots retained control of Montauban and La Rochelle.

Louis ultimately dismissed Noël Brûlart de Sillery and Pierre Brûlart in 1624 because of his displeasure with how they handled the diplomatic situation over the Valtellina with Spain. Valtellina was an area with Catholic inhabitants under the suzerainty of the Protestant Three Leagues. It served as an important route to Italy for France and it provided an easy connection between the Spanish and the Holy Roman empires, especially in helping each other with armies if necessary. Spain was constantly interfering in the Valtellina, which angered Louis, as he wanted to hold possession of this strategically important passageway. He therefore found a better servitor in his Superintendent of Finances Charles de La Vieuville, who held similar views of Spain as the king, and who advised Louis to side with the Dutch via the Treaty of Compiègne.
However, La Vieuville was dismissed by the middle of 1624, partly due to his bad behaviour (during his tenure as superintendent he was arrogant and incompetent) and because of a well-organized pamphlet campaign by Cardinal Richelieu against his council rival. Louis needed a new chief advisor; Cardinal Richelieu would be that counsellor.

==Ministry of Cardinal Richelieu, 1624–1642==

Cardinal Richelieu played a major role in Louis XIII&#x27;s reign from 1624, determining France&#x27;s direction over the course of the next eighteen years. As a result of Richelieu&#x27;s work, Louis XIII became one of the first examples of an absolute monarch. Under Louis and Richelieu, the crown successfully intervened in the Thirty Years&#x27; War against the Habsburgs, managed to keep the French nobility in line, and retracted the political and military privileges granted to the Huguenots by Henry IV (while maintaining their religious freedoms). Louis XIII successfully led the important Siege of La Rochelle. In addition, Louis had the port of Le Havre modernised, and he built a powerful navy.

Louis also worked to reverse the trend of promising French artists leaving for Italy to work and study. He commissioned the painters Nicolas Poussin and Philippe de Champaigne to decorate the Louvre Palace. In foreign matters, Louis organised the development and administration of New France, expanding its settlements westward along the Saint Lawrence River from Quebec City to Montreal.

==Expansion overseas under Louis XIII==

===Morocco===
In order to continue the exploration efforts of his predecessor Henry IV, Louis XIII considered a colonial venture in Morocco, and sent a fleet under Isaac de Razilly in 1619. Razilly was able to explore the coast as far as Mogador. In 1624 he was given charge of an embassy to the pirate harbour of Salé in Morocco, in order to solve the affair of the Zaydani Library of Mulay Zidan.

In 1630, Razilly was able to negotiate the purchase of French slaves from the Moroccans. He visited Morocco again in 1631, and helped negotiate the Franco-Moroccan Treaty (1631). The treaty gave France preferential treatment, known as capitulations: preferential tariffs, the establishment of a consulate, and freedom of religion for French subjects.

===Americas===

Unlike other colonial powers, France, under the guidance of Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, encouraged a peaceful coexistence in New France between the natives and the colonists. Indians, converted to Catholicism, were considered as &quot;natural Frenchmen&quot; by the Ordonnance of 1627:
Acadia was also developed under Louis XIII. In 1632, Isaac de Razilly became involved, at the request of Cardinal Richelieu, in the colonization of Acadia, by taking possession of Port-Royal (now Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia) and developing it into a French colony. The King gave Razilly the official title of lieutenant-general for New France. He took on military tasks such as taking control of Fort Pentagouet at Majabigwaduce on the Penobscot Bay, which had been given to France in an earlier Treaty, and to inform the English they were to vacate all lands north of Pemaquid. This resulted in all the French interests in Acadia being restored. In Brazil, the colony of Equinoctial France was established in 1612, but only lasted 4 years until it was eliminated by the Portuguese. In 1642, Louis XIII authorised French subjects to engage in the Atlantic slave trade provided those they enslaved were converted to Christianity.

===Asia===
France-Japan relations started under Louis XIII in 1615 when Hasekura Tsunenaga, a Japanese samurai and ambassador, sent to Rome by Date Masamune, landed at Saint-Tropez for a few days. In 1636, Guillaume Courtet, a French Dominican priest, reciprocated when he set foot in Japan.

Also in 1615, Marie de&#x27; Medici incorporated the merchants of Dieppe and other harbours to found the Company of the Moluccas. In 1619, an armed expedition composed of three ships (275 crew, 106 cannon) and called the &quot;Fleet of Montmorency&quot; under General Augustin de Beaulieu was sent from Honfleur, to fight the Dutch in the Far East. In 1624, with the Treaty of Compiègne, Cardinal Richelieu obtained an agreement to halt the Dutch–French warfare in the Far East.

==Antipathy with brother==
Twice the king&#x27;s younger brother, Gaston, Duke of Orléans, had to leave France for conspiring against his government and for attempting to undermine the influence of his mother and Cardinal Richelieu. After waging an unsuccessful war in Languedoc, he took refuge in Flanders. In 1643, on the death of Louis XIII, Gaston became lieutenant-general of the kingdom and fought against Spain on the northern frontiers of France.

==Marriage==

On 24 November 1615, Louis XIII married Anne of Austria, daughter of Philip III of Spain. The couple were second cousins, by mutual descent from Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. This marriage followed a tradition of cementing military and political alliances between the Catholic powers of France and Spain with royal marriages. The tradition went back to the marriage of Louis VII of France and Constance of Castile. The marriage was only briefly happy, and the King&#x27;s duties often kept them apart. After 23 years of marriage and four stillbirths, Anne finally gave birth to a son on 5 September 1638, the future Louis XIV.

Many people regarded this birth as a miracle and, in show of gratitude to God for the long-awaited birth of an heir, his parents named him Louis-&quot;Dieudonné&quot; (&quot;God-given&quot;). As another sign of gratitude, according to several interpretations, seven months before his birth, France was dedicated by Louis XIII to the Virgin Mary, who, many believed, had interceded for the perceived miracle. But the text of the dedication does not mention the royal pregnancy and birth as one of its reasons, and Louis XIII himself is said to have expressed his scepticism with regard to the miracle after his son&#x27;s birth. In gratitude for having successfully given birth, the queen founded the Benedictine abbey of the Val-de-Grâce, for which Louis XIV laid the cornerstone of its church, an early masterpiece of French Baroque architecture.

==Issue==
The couple had the following offspring:

Voltaire claimed in the second edition of &quot;Questions sur l&#x27;Encyclopédie&quot; (1771) that before Louis XIV was born, Louis XIII had an illegitimate son, who was jailed and his face hidden beneath an iron mask (see the Man in the Iron Mask).

==Sexuality==

There is no evidence that Louis kept mistresses (a distinction that earned him the title &quot;Louis the Chaste&quot;), but several reports suggest that he may have been homosexual. The prolonged temporal gap between the queen&#x27;s pregnancies may have been a result of Louis XIII&#x27;s aversion to heterosexual activity, a matter of great political consequence, since it took the couple more than 20 years of marriage before Louis XIV&#x27;s birth. His interests as a teenager were focused on male courtiers and he developed an intense emotional attachment to his favourite, Charles d&#x27;Albert, although some say there is no clear evidence of a sexual relationship. Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux, drawing from rumours told to him by a critic of the King (the Marquise de Rambouillet), explicitly speculated in his &quot;Historiettes&quot; about what happened in the king&#x27;s bed.

A further liaison with an equerry, François de Baradas, ended when the latter lost favour fighting a duel after duelling had been forbidden by royal decree.

Louis was also captivated by Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, Marquis of Cinq-Mars, 19 years his younger, who was later executed for conspiring with the Spanish enemy in time of war. Tallemant described how on a royal journey, the King &quot;sent M. le Grand [de Cinq-Mars] to undress, who returned, adorned like a bride. &#x27;To bed, to bed&#x27; he said to him impatiently... and the mignon was not in before the king was already kissing his hands. But he did not find that M. le Grand, whose heart was elsewhere, responded to his great ardour.&quot;

==Death==
Louis XIII was unwell during the winter of 1642–1643. He managed a few hunting trips to Versailles, but by the middle of February was mostly bedridden. From contemporary descriptions, modern historians have surmised that he suffered from extrapulmonary tuberculosis. On 13 April his chief physician informed him that his illness would be fatal. He died in Paris on 14 May 1643, the 33rd anniversary of his father&#x27;s death. According to his biographer A. Lloyd Moote, &quot;his intestines were inflamed and ulcerated, making digestion virtually impossible; tuberculosis had spread to his lungs, accompanied by habitual cough. Either of these major ailments, or the accumulation of minor problems, may have killed him, not to mention physiological weaknesses that made him prone to disease or his doctors&#x27; remedies of enemas and bleedings, which continued right to his death.&quot;

==Composer and lute player==
Louis XIII shared his mother&#x27;s love of the lute, developed in her childhood in Florence. One of his first toys was a lute and his personal doctor, Jean Héroard, reports him playing it for his mother in 1604, at the age of three. In 1635, Louis XIII composed the music, wrote the libretto and designed the costumes for the &quot;Ballet de la Merlaison.&quot; The king himself danced in two performances of the ballet the same year at Chantilly and Royaumont.

==Influence on men&#x27;s fashion==
In the sphere of men&#x27;s fashion, Louis helped introduce the wearing of wigs among men in 1624. This fashion spread in Europe and European-influenced countries in the 1660s and was a dominant style among men for about 140 years, until the change of dress in the 1790s which was affected by the French Revolution (1789–1799).

==In fiction and film==
* Louis XIII, his wife Anne, and Cardinal Richelieu became central figures in Alexandre Dumas, &quot;père&quot;&#x27;s 1844 novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and subsequent television and film adaptations. The book depicts Louis as a man willing to have Richelieu as a powerful advisor but aware of his scheming; he is portrayed as bored and sour, dwarfed by Richelieu&#x27;s intellect. Films such as the 1948, the 1973 or the 2011 versions tend to treat Louis XIII as a comic character, depicting him as bumbling and incompetent. In the 1993 film, he is depicted as willing to stand up to Richelieu when necessary but still strongly influenced by him. He is also depicted as in love with his wife, Anne, but very nervous and unsure around her.
* The 2014 BBC TV series, &quot;The Musketeers&quot;, merging the historical with the fictional, portrayed the King as both incompetent and strong, whose alliance with Spain is ever faltering. He is portrayed by Ryan Gage.
* Arthur Lubin portrayed him in the 1926 film &quot;Bardelys the Magnificent&quot;.
* Louis XIII, his wife Anne, his younger brother Gaston, Cardinal Richelieu, Cardinal Mazarin and members of the Royal family are mentioned throughout the course of the &quot;1632 series&quot; of novels and other writings by Eric Flint &quot;et al.&quot;, especially &quot;1636: The Cardinal Virtues&quot;.
* Louis XIII appears in novels of Robert Merle&#x27;s &quot;Fortune de France&quot; series (1977–2003).
* Louis XIII was portrayed by Edward Arnold in the 1935 film &quot;Cardinal Richelieu&quot;, with George Arliss portraying the Cardinal.
* Ken Russell directed the 1971 film &quot;The Devils&quot;, in which Louis XIII is a significant character, albeit one with no resemblance to the real man. Louis XIII is portrayed as an effeminate gay man who amuses himself by shooting Protestants dressed up as birds. The film was based on Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1952 book &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot;.
* Louis XIII appears in the 2002 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;The Church and the Crown&quot;.

<doc id="77096" wikidata="Q16733607" url="?curid=77096" title="Government of Ghana">
<text>The Government of Ghana was created as a parliamentary democracy, followed by alternating military and civilian governments in Ghana. In January 1993, military government gave way to the Fourth Republic after presidential and parliamentary elections in late 1992. The 1992 constitution divides powers among a president, parliament, cabinet, council of state, and an independent judiciary. The government is elected by universal suffrage.

==Government==


Political parties became legal in mid-1992 after a ten-year hiatus. There are more than 20 registered political parties under the Fourth Republic. The two main parties are the National Democratic Congress and the New Patriotic Party. The National Democratic Congress is the successor organisation to Jerry John Rawlings&#x27; Provisional National Defence Council which was in power from 1981 to 1992.

The New Patriotic Party, found in 1992, is the successor to the Gold Coast&#x27;s The Big Six independence achiever party United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC); the People&#x27;s National Convention, and the Convention People&#x27;s Party, successor to Kwame Nkrumah&#x27;s original party of the same name, which was the incumbent government of Ghana for 10 years from declaration of independence in 1957 to 1966, winning elections in 1956, 1960, and 1965.

The National Democratic Congress won the presidential and parliamentary elections in 1992, 1996, 2008 and 2012. The New Patriotic Party won the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2000, 2004, and 2016. In 2020, the NPP won the Presidency, yet tied in the parliamentary elections with the NDC and the single seat that remained was filled by an independent, turning the NPP into the Fourth Republic’s first minority government. The following election in 2024, the National Democratic Congress 
managed to return to power, winning both the Presidency and parliament handedly, making their candidate, former President John Mahama (2012-2017), the first President to serve a non-consecutive second term.
===Foreign relations===

Since independence, Ghana has been devoted to ideals of nonalignment and is a founding member of the non-aligned movement. Ghana favors international and regional political and economic co-operation, and is an active member of the United Nations and the African Union.

Many Ghanaian diplomats and politicians hold positions in international organisations. These include Ghanaian diplomat and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, International Criminal Court Judge Akua Kuenyehia, former President Jerry John Rawlings and former President John Agyekum Kuffour who have both served as diplomats of the United Nations.

In September 2010, Ghana&#x27;s former President John Atta Mills visited China on an official visit. Mills and China&#x27;s former President Hu Jintao, marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two nations, at the Great Hall of the People on 20 September 2010. China reciprocated with a visit in November 2011, by the vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress of China, Zhou Tienong who visited Ghana and met with Ghana&#x27;s President John Dramani Mahama.

===Judicial system===

The legal system is based on the 1992 constitution, customary (traditional) law, and British common law. Court hierarchy consists of Supreme Court of Ghana (highest court), courts of appeal, and high courts of justice. Beneath these bodies are circuit, magisterial, and traditional courts. Extrajudicial institutions include public tribunals. Since independence, courts are relatively independent; this independence continues under the Republic. Lower courts are being redefined and reorganized under the Republic.

===Administrative divisions===

There are sixteen administrative regions of the Republic of Ghana which are divided into 6 metropolitan assemblies; 55 Municipal assemblies; and 216 districts, each with its own district assembly. Below districts are various types of councils, including 58 town or area councils; 108 zonal councils; and 626 area councils. Over 16,000 unit committees exist on the lowest level. Ghana has 275 electoral constituencies.

<text>Year 388 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Capitolinus, Fidenas, Iullus, Corvus, Flavus and Rufus (or, less frequently, year 366 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 388 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* King Agesipolis I leads a Spartan army against Argos. Since no Argive army challenges him, he plunders the countryside for a time, and then, after receiving several unfavorable omens, returns to Sparta.
* The Athenian general, Thrasybulus, sails to Lesbos, where, with the support of the Mytileneans, he defeats the Spartan forces on the island and wins over a number of cities. While still on Lesbos, however, Thrasybulus is killed by raiders from the city of Aspendus where his financial exactions have made him unpopular.
* Concerned about the revival of Athenian imperialist ambitions, the Persian King Artaxerxes II and King Agesilaus II of Sparta enter into an alliance. Sparta also seeks and gains the support of Dionysius I of Syracuse.
* Athens defeats Sparta

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* A Spartan expeditionary force under King Agesilaus II crosses the Gulf of Corinth to attack Acarnania, an ally of the anti-Spartan coalition. Agesilaus is eventually able to draw them into a pitched battle, in which the Acarnanians are routed.
* The Athenian general, Thrasybulus, leads a force of triremes to levy tribute from cities around the Aegean and support Rhodes, where a democratic government is struggling against Sparta. On this campaign, Thrasybulus captures Byzantium, imposes a duty on ships passing through the Hellespont, and collects tribute from many of the Aegean Islands.
* Due to threats of attack from Akarnania, Kalydon garrisons the Achaeans.
* The orator Isaeus gives his earliest known speech, the Dicaeogenes.

==== Magna Grecia ====

He is eventually assassinated in 381 BC at the funeral of King Diao of Chu, although his assassins are executed shortly after by the newly enthroned King Su of Chu.
* This is the latest possible date for the compilation of the historical text &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, attributed to a blind historian known as Zuo Qiuming.

<text>Year 314 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Libo and Longus (or, less frequently, year 440 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;).

=== By place ===
==== Macedonian Empire ====
* Aristodemus of Miletus convinces the common assembly of the Aetolians to support Antigonus 
* Alexander, son of Polyperchon, is killed by Alexion of Sicyon. Alexander&#x27;s wife Cratesipolis assumes power and holds his army together. 
* Antigonus, the ruler of the Asian parts of the late Alexander the Great&#x27;s empire, faces a coalition consisting of Cassander, the Macedonian regent; Lysimachus, the satrap of Thrace; and Ptolemy, the satrap of Egypt, who have taken the side of the ousted satrap of Babylon, Seleucus.
* Antigonus does not trust Peithon&#x27;s growing power. So Antigonus tricks Peithon to come to his court, where Antigonus has him executed.
* Antigonus invades Syria, then under Ptolemy&#x27;s control, and besieges and captures Tyre. Antigonus then occupies Syria, proclaiming himself regent.

==== Greece ====
* As Cassander fights to retain control over central Greece, Antigonus promises freedom to the Greek cities in a bid to gain support from them against Cassander. 
* The Aetolians enter into an alliance with Antigonus, and the League of the Islanders is established under Antigonus&#x27; hegemony. Cassander marches against them with his allies Lysimachus, Ptolemy and Seleucus and destroys the city of Agrinio.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Success seems to be going the Samnites&#x27; way in their ongoing battles against the Romans. Campania is on the verge of deserting Rome. Peace is established between Rome and some Samnite towns.
* The Roman consuls march their combined army to Tarracina and defeat a Samnite army there; killing 10,000 Samnites in the battle and the subsequent pursuit.
* While the consuls are fighting the Samnites at Tarracina, the Romans elect Gaius Maenius as Dictator with Marcus Foslius Flaccinator as his Magister Equitum (Master-of-Horse, Second-in-Command) and send them into Campania at the head of a large army. When Maenius and Foslius arrive near Capua, the Campanians, hearing about the defeat of the Samnites at Tarracina, start negotiating terms with the Romans; they surrender those who are guilty of the uprising and in turn are reinstated in their alliance with Rome.

==== China ====
* Zhou Nan Wang becomes King of the Zhou dynasty of China.
* The city of Guilin is founded by the Qin dynasty.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Xenocrates, Greek philosopher, pupil of Plato and head of the Greek Academy (b. 396 BC)
* Aeschines, Athenian orator and politician (b. 389 BC)
* Alexander (son of Polyperchon)

<doc id="77118" wikidata="Q371482" url="?curid=77118" title="Apple Lisa">
<text>Lisa is a desktop computer developed by Apple, produced from January 19, 1983, to August 1, 1986, and succeeded by Macintosh. It is generally considered the first mass-market personal computer operable through a graphical user interface (GUI). In 1983, a machine like the Lisa was still so expensive that it was primarily marketed to individual and small and medium-sized businesses as a groundbreaking new alternative to much bigger and more expensive mainframes or minicomputers such as from IBM, that either require additional, expensive consultancy from the supplier, hiring specially trained personnel, or at least, a much steeper learning curve to maintain and operate. Earlier GUI-controlled personal computers were not mass-marketed; for example, Xerox PARC manufactured its Alto workstation only for Xerox and select partners from the early to mid-1970s.

Development of project &quot;LISA&quot; began in 1978. It underwent many changes and shipped at with a five-megabyte hard drive. It was affected by its high price, insufficient software, unreliable FileWare (codename Twiggy) floppy disks, and the imminent release of the cheaper and faster Macintosh. Only 60,000 Lisa units were sold in two years.

Lisa was considered a commercial failure but with technical acclaim, introducing several advanced features that reappeared on the Macintosh and eventually IBM PC compatibles. These include an operating system with memory protection and a document-oriented workflow. The hardware is more advanced overall than the following Macintosh, including hard disk drive support, up to 2 megabytes (MB) of random-access memory (RAM), expansion slots, and a larger, higher-resolution display.

Lisa&#x27;s CPU and the storage system were strained by the complexity of the operating system and applications, especially its office suite, and by the ad hoc protected memory implementation, due to the lack of a Motorola memory management unit. Cost-cutting measures that target the consumer market, and the delayed availability of the 68000 processor and its impact on the design process, made the user experience sluggish. The workstation-tier high price and lack of a technical software application library made it a difficult sale for all markets. The IBM PC&#x27;s popularity and Apple&#x27;s decision to compete with itself through the lower-priced Macintosh also hindered Lisa&#x27;s acceptance.

In 1981, after Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project by Apple&#x27;s board of directors, he appropriated the Macintosh project from Jef Raskin, who had conceived it as a sub- text-based appliance computer in 1979. Jobs immediately redefined Macintosh to be graphical, but as a less expensive and more focused alternative to Lisa.

Macintosh&#x27;s launch in January 1984 quickly surpassed Lisa&#x27;s underwhelming sales. Jobs began assimilating increasing numbers of Lisa staff, as he had done with the Apple II division upon taking Raskin&#x27;s project. Newer Lisa models addressed its shortcomings but, even with a major price reduction, the platform failed to achieve sales volumes comparable to the much less expensive Mac. The Lisa 2/10 is the final model, then rebranded as the high-end Macintosh XL.

==History==
===Development===
====Name====
Though the original documentation only refers to it as &quot;The Lisa&quot;, Apple officially stated that the name was an acronym for &quot;Local Integrated Software Architecture&quot;. Because Steve Jobs&#x27;s first daughter was named Lisa (born in 1978), it was sometimes inferred that the name also had a personal association, and perhaps that the acronym was a backronym contrived later to fit the name. Andy Hertzfeld said that the acronym was reverse-engineered from the name &quot;Lisa&quot; in late 1982 by the Apple marketing team after they had hired a marketing consultancy firm to find names to replace &quot;Lisa&quot; and &quot;Macintosh&quot; (at the time considered by Jef Raskin to be merely internal project codenames) and then rejected all of the suggestions. Privately, Hertzfeld and the other software developers used &quot;Lisa: Invented Stupid Acronym&quot;, a recursive backronym, and computer industry pundits coined the term &quot;Let&#x27;s Invent Some Acronym&quot; to fit Lisa&#x27;s name. Decades later, Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson: &quot;Obviously it was named for my daughter.&quot;

====Research and design====
The project began in 1978 as an effort to create a more modern version of the then-conventional design epitomized by the Apple II. A ten-person team occupied its first dedicated office at 20863 Stevens Creek Boulevard next to the Good Earth restaurant, and nicknamed &quot;the Good Earth building&quot;. Initial team leader Ken Rothmuller was soon replaced by John Couch, under whose direction the project evolved into the &quot;window-and-mouse-driven&quot; form of its eventual release. Trip Hawkins and Jef Raskin contributed to this change in design. Apple&#x27;s co-founder Steve Jobs was involved in the concept.

At Xerox&#x27;s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), research had already been underway for several years to create a new humanized way to organize the computer screen, which became known as the desktop metaphor. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979 and was absorbed and excited by the revolutionary mouse-driven GUI of the Alto. By late 1979, Jobs successfully negotiated a sale of Apple stock to Xerox, in exchange for his Lisa team receiving two demonstrations of ongoing research projects at PARC. When the Apple team saw the demonstration of the Alto computer, they were able to see in action the basic elements of what constituted a workable GUI. The Lisa team put a great deal of work into making the graphical interface a mainstream commercial product.

The Lisa was a major project at Apple, which reportedly spent more than on its development. More than 90 people participated in the design, plus more in the sales and marketing effort, to launch the machine. &quot;BYTE&quot; magazine credited Wayne Rosing with being the most important person in the development of the computer&#x27;s hardware until the machine went into production, at which point he became the technical lead for the entire Lisa project. The hardware development team was headed by Robert Paratore. The industrial design, product design, and mechanical packaging were headed by Bill Dresselhaus, the Principal Product Designer of Lisa, with his team of internal product designers and contract product designers from the firm that eventually became IDEO. Bruce Daniels was in charge of applications development, and Larry Tesler was in charge of system software. The user interface was designed in six months, after which the hardware, operating system, and applications were all created in parallel.

In 1980, Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, and he appropriated Jef Raskin&#x27;s existing Macintosh project. Raskin had conceived and led Macintosh since 1979 as a text-based appliance computer. Jobs redefined Macintosh as a cheaper and more usable form of Lisa&#x27;s concepts, and led the skunkworks project with substantial motivation to compete in parallel with the Lisa team.

In September 1981, below the announcement of the IBM PC, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; reported on Lisa, &quot;McIntosh&quot;, and another Apple computer secretly under development &quot;to be ready for release within a year&quot;. It described Lisa as having a 68000 processor and 128KB RAM, and &quot;designed to compete with the new Xerox Star at a considerably lower price&quot;. In May 1982, the magazine reported that &quot;Apple&#x27;s yet-to-be-announced Lisa 68000 network work station is also widely rumored to have a mouse.&quot; &quot;BYTE&quot; reported similar rumors that month.

===Launch===
Lisa was announced on January 19, 1983. By then, the press discussed rumors of Macintosh as a much less-expensive Apple computer with similar functionality, perhaps planned for late 1983. &quot;Apple Confidential&quot; said, &quot;Even before the Lisa began shipping in June, the press was full of intentionally-leaked rumors about a fall release of a &#x27;baby Lisa&#x27; that would work in much the same way, only faster and cheaper. Its name: Macintosh.&quot; Lisa&#x27;s low sales were quickly surpassed by the January 1984 launch of the Macintosh. Newer versions of the Lisa were introduced that addressed its faults and lowered its price considerably, but it failed to achieve sales comparable to the much less expensive Mac. The Macintosh project assimilated a lot more Lisa staff. The final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.

===Discontinuation===
The high cost and the delays in its release date contributed to the Lisa&#x27;s discontinuation although it was repackaged and sold at , as the Lisa 2. In 1986, the entire Lisa platform was discontinued.

In 1987, Sun Remarketing purchased about 5,000 Macintosh XLs and upgraded them. In 1989, with the help of Sun Remarketing, Apple disposed of approximately 2,700 unsold Lisa units in a guarded landfill in Logan, Utah, to receive a tax write-off on the unsold inventory. Some leftover Lisa computers and spare parts were available until Cherokee Data (which purchased Sun Remarketing) went out of business.

==Overview==
===Hardware===

The Lisa was first introduced on January 19, 1983. It is one of the first personal computer systems with a graphical user interface (GUI) to be sold commercially. It uses a Motorola 68000 CPU clocked at 5 MHz and has 1 MB of RAM. It can be upgraded to 2 MB and later shipped with as little as 512 kilobytes. The CPU speed and model were not changed from the release of the Lisa 1 to the repackaging of the hardware as Macintosh XL.

The real-time clock uses a 4-bit integer and the base year is defined as 1980; the software won&#x27;t accept any value below 1981, so the only valid range is 1981–1995. The real-time clock depends on a NiCd pack of batteries that only lasts for a few hours when main power is not present. Prone to failure over time, the battery packs could leak corrosive alkaline electrolyte and ruin the circuit boards.

The integrated monochrome black-on-white monitor has rectangular pixels on a screen.

Lisa&#x27;s printer support includes Apple&#x27;s Dot Matrix, Daisy Wheel, and ImageWriter dot matrix printers, and Canon&#x27;s new color inkjet technology.

The original Lisa, later called the Lisa 1, has two FileWare 5.25-inch double-sided variable-speed floppy disk drives, more commonly known by Apple&#x27;s codename &quot;Twiggy&quot;. They have what was then a very high capacity of approximately 871 kB each, but are unreliable and use proprietary diskettes. Competing systems with high diskette data storage have much larger 8&quot; floppy disks, seen as cumbersome and old-fashioned for a consumer system.

Lisa 1&#x27;s innovations include block sparing, to reserve blocks in case of bad blocks, even on floppy disks. Critical operating system information has redundant storage, for recovery in case of corruption.

====Lisa [1983]====

The original Lisa Computer (Lisa 1) was introduced in January 1983 and began shipping in June 1983. The machine was powered by a 5 MHz Motorola 68000 processor with an integrated monochrome black-on-white monitor having 720 × 364 rectangular pixels displayed on a 12-inch (30 cm) screen . The computer shipped with two “Twiggy” floppy disk drives along with Lisa OS and office productivity software. The interface included a detached keyboard, a &#x27;thin button&#x27; mouse, with a parallel port for Apple ProFile external hard drive(s), and three (3) expansion slots for future upgrades. The Lisa launched in January 1983 at a cost of $9,995.

====Lisa 2 [1984-1985]====

The second hardware revision, the Lisa 2, was released in January 1984 and was priced between and . It was much less expensive than the original model, and dropped the Twiggy floppy drives in favor of a single 400K Sony microfloppy. The Lisa 2 has as little as 512 KB of RAM.

The Lisa 2 line of products included the Lisa 2/5 which consisted of a Lisa 2 bundled with an external ProFile hard drive (5 megabyte capacity) or Lisa 2/10 with external ProFile hard drive (10 megabyte capacity) . 

Owners of the original Lisa (1983) computer with Twiggy drives and software, were offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2. The upgrade replaced the pair of Twiggy drives with a single 3.5-inch drive, and updating the boot ROM and I/O ROM and modification to the IO board. The upgrade included the new Lisa 2&#x27;s new front faceplate to accommodate the newer microdisk (400K) drive which incorporated the new inlaid Apple logo. This faceplate was the first to incorporate Apples Snow White design language elements. 

Developing early Macintosh software required a Lisa2. There were relatively few third-party hardware offerings for the Lisa, as compared to the earlier AST offered a memory board which, when combined with the standard Apple memory board, expanded the Lisa to a total of of memory, the maximum amount that the MMU can address.

Late in the product life of the Lisa, there were third-party hard disk drives, SCSI controllers, and double-sided 3.5-inch floppy-disk upgrades. Unlike the original Macintosh, the Lisa has expansion slots. The Lisa 2 motherboard has a very basic backplane with virtually no electronic components, but plenty of edge connector sockets and slots. There are two RAM slots, one CPU upgrade slot, and one I/O slot, all in parallel. At the other end are three Lisa slots in parallel.

Late in 1984, the Lisa 2/10 spun off another variation that incorporated an internal 10 MB hard drive (Widget Drive), a modified motherboard removing the parallel port and internal cards, with upgraded power supply, along with the standard configuration of of RAM. There was no upgrade path for this configuration as the hardware and wiring harness was electrically incompatible with the original Lisa 1 or 2 chassis.&quot;

=====Macintosh XL [1985-1986]=====
In January 1985, following the release of the Macintosh, the Lisa 2/10 (with integrated 10 MB hard drive) was rebranded as Macintosh XL. positioning it as the high-end Macintosh. The price was lowered yet again, to $4,000, and sales tripled, but CEO John Sculley said that Apple would have lost money increasing production to meet the new demand. There was an upgrade kit for Lisa computers that included a hardware and software kit, enabling it to reboot into Macintosh mode and display SQUARE pixels in place of the rectangular pixels of the Lisa.

Apple discontinued the Macintosh XL, leaving an eight-month void in Apple&#x27;s high-end product line until the Macintosh Plus was introduced in 1986.

===Software===
====Lisa OS====
The Lisa operating system features protected memory, enabled by a crude hardware circuit compared to the Sun-1 workstation (c. 1982), which features a full memory management unit. Motorola did not have an MMU (memory-management unit) for the 68000 ready in time, so third parties developed their own. Apple&#x27;s is also the result of a cost-cutting compromise, with sluggish performance. Based, in part, on elements from the Apple III SOS operating system released three years earlier, Lisa&#x27;s disk operating system also organizes its files in hierarchical directories. File system directories correspond to GUI folders, as with previous Xerox PARC computers from which Lisa borrowed heavily. Lisa was designed around a hard drive, unlike the first Macintosh.

Lisa has two main user modes: the Lisa Office System and the Workshop. The Lisa Office System is the GUI environment for end users. The Workshop is a program development environment and is almost entirely text-based, though it uses a GUI text editor. The Lisa Office System was eventually renamed 7/7 which refers to the seven supplied application programs: LisaWrite, LisaCalc, LisaDraw, LisaGraph, LisaProject, LisaList, and LisaTerminal.

Apple&#x27;s warranty said that this software works precisely as stated, and Apple refunded an unspecified number of users, in full, for their systems. These operating system frailties, and costly recalls, combined with the very high price point, led to the failure of the Lisa in the marketplace. NASA purchased Lisa machines, mainly to use the LisaProject program.

In 2018, the Computer History Museum announced it would be releasing the source code for Lisa OS, following a check by Apple to ensure this would not impact other intellectual property. For copyright reasons, this release does not include the American Heritage dictionary. For its 40th anniversary on January 19, 2023, Lisa OS Software version 3.1&#x27;s source code is available under an Apple Academic License Agreement.

====MacWorks====

In April 1984, following the Macintosh launch, Apple introduced MacWorks, a software emulation environment enabling Lisa to run Macintosh System software and applications. MacWorks improved Lisa&#x27;s market appeal. After the early Macintosh operating system first gained hard disk support, MacWorks also gained access to Lisa&#x27;s hard disk in September. In January 1985, MacWorks was re-branded MacWorks XL as the primary system application, to convert the Lisa into the Macintosh XL.

====Third-party software====

The launch version of Lisa Office System can not be used for programming, requiring the separate development OS called Lisa Workshop to be toggled and booted. Lisa Workshop was also used to develop Macintosh software for its first few years, until a Macintosh-native development system was released. For most of its lifetime, the Lisa only had the original seven applications that Apple had deemed enough to &quot;do everything&quot;. UniPress Software released UNIX System III for .

Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) published Microsoft Xenix (version 3), a Unix-like command-line operating system for the Lisa 2, and Microsoft&#x27;s Multiplan 2.1 spreadsheet for Xenix. Other Lisa Xenix apps include Quadratron&#x27;s Q-Office suite.

UniPress Software also provided a version of Unix System V for the Lisa 2, offering a C compiler and &quot;Berkeley enhancements&quot; such as vi and the C shell, supporting hard drives ranging from 20 MB to 100 MB along with Ethernet connectivity. Additional applications could be purchased from UniPress, and a less expensive single-user edition was also sold for alongside the multi-user edition. A variety of other programming languages were supported by the operating system.

==Reception==

&quot;BYTE&quot; previewed the Lisa and wrote in February 1983 that it was &quot;the most important development in computers in the last five years, easily outpacing [the IBM PC]&quot;. It acknowledged that the price was high, and concluded &quot;Apple ... is not unaware that most people would be incredibly interested in a similar but less expensive machine. We&#x27;ll see what happens&quot;.

The Lisa 2 was received more favourably by BYTE in December 1984, describing it as possibly &quot;the most underrated machine in the history of the microcomputer industry ... more versatile and powerful than any other machine in its under-$7000 price category&quot;. Priced from , the base model was largely perceived as a &quot;wide-screen Macintosh&quot; with four times the memory of that machine and able to run its software, but nevertheless &quot;the only practical way to run even moderately large Macintosh applications&quot; at that time. Hard disk models were priced from , and the range of supported hard disk sizes, along with the &quot;large memory&quot;, were seen as contributing to the machine&#x27;s versatility. The provision of a character-based display support was seen as &quot;critical to XENIX and UNIX users&quot;, and the availability of these other operating systems also served to differentiate the Lisa from the Macintosh. System performance had also improved from the original Lisa product.

The Lisa was a commercial failure, the company&#x27;s largest since the Apple III of 1980. Apple sold a total of approximately 10,000 Lisa machines at each, generating total sales of against a development cost of more than . The largest Lisa customer was NASA, which used LisaProject for project management.

The Lisa 2 and its Mac ROM-enabled Macintosh XL version are the final two releases in the Lisa line, which was discontinued in April 1985. The Macintosh XL is a hardware and software conversion kit to effectively reboot Lisa into Macintosh mode. In 1986, Apple offered all Lisa and XL owners the opportunity to return their computer and pay , in exchange for a Macintosh Plus and Hard Disk 20. Reportedly, 2,700 working but unsold Lisa computers were buried in a landfill.

==Legacy==
Apple&#x27;s culture of object-oriented programming on Lisa contributed to the 1988 conception of Pink, the first attempt to re-architect the operating system of Macintosh.

In 1989, after Wayne Rosing had moved to Sun Microsystems, he reflected on his time at Apple, recalling that building the Lisa had been hard work. He said the system&#x27;s hard disk and RAM was a requirement and not a luxury, but that the system remains slow. He noted that, by 1989, Lisa&#x27;s level of integration between applications had not yet been repeated by Apple.

Original &quot;Twiggy&quot; based Lisa 1 systems command high prices at auction due to the scarcity of surviving examples. The auction record for a Lisa 1 was set on September 10, 2024, when a Lisa from the estate of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen was sold for $882,000.

<text>Year 445 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augurinus and Philo (or, less frequently, year 309 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 445 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* Pericles, concerned over the draining effect of years of war on Athenian manpower, looks for peace with the support of the Assembly. Athenian diplomat, Callias, goes to Sparta and after much bargaining arranges a peace treaty with Sparta and her Peloponnesian allies, thus extending the 5 year truce of 451 BC for another 30 years. According to this treaty, Megara is to be returned to the Peloponnesian League, Troezen and Achaea become independent, Aegina is to become a tributary to Athens but autonomous, and disputes are to be settled by arbitration. Each party agrees to respect the alliances of the other.

==== Roman Republic ====
* A new law, the &quot;Lex Canuleia&quot; removes the ban on inter-marriage of the Roman classes, i.e. plebeian with patrician.
* The Plebeians demand the right to stand for election as consul but the Roman senate refused to grant them this right. Ultimately, a compromise is reached, and consular command authority is granted to Consular Tribunes (&quot;Military Tribunes with Consular powers&quot; or tribuni militares consulari potestate).
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Approximate date – Antisthenes, Athenian philosopher (d. c.365 BC)

<text>Aquafina () is an American brand of purified bottled water that is produced by PepsiCo, consisting of both unflavored and flavored water. The Aquafina brand name is also licensed for use on multiple skin care products, including lip balm and wrinkle cream. It was first distributed in Wichita, Kansas in 1994, before becoming more widely sold across the United States, Canada, Spain, Peru (called &quot;San Carlos&quot;), Lebanon, Turkey, the GCC countries, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India to compete with The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s Dasani and Dr. Pepper Snapple&#x27;s Deja Blue. As of 2009, Aquafina represented 13.4% of domestic bottled water sales in the United States, making it the number one bottled water brand as measured by retail sales.
There are over 40 Aquafina Purification Plants in the United States and Canada. These locations are unknown at this time.

==Product variants==
Aquafina Pure Water, the primary unflavored product produced under the Aquafina brand, is derived from local municipal water sources and goes through a purification process that incorporates reverse osmosis, ultraviolet, and ozone sterilization. Beginning on July 27, 2007, a disclaimer was added to each bottle of Aquafina, stating the water comes from a &quot;public source&quot;. In Canada, the current bottle of water displays &quot;Demineralized Treat Water&quot;. In response to concerns amongst environmental advocates who raised questions over the disclosure of water sources, a PepsiCo spokeswoman stated, &quot;If this helps clarify the fact that the water originates from public sources, then it&#x27;s a reasonable thing to do.&quot; Flavored variations are also produced under the Aquafina brand name – all of which are labeled as containing no calories and no carbohydrates. &quot;Aquafina FlavorSplash&quot;, first introduced in 2005, is a flavored water product line which is non-carbonated and artificially sweetened with Sucralose. As of 2011, it is produced in six flavors: Grape, Strawberry Kiwi, Wild Berry, Raspberry, Lemon, and Peach Mango. &quot;Aquafina Sparkling&quot; is a carbonated line of flavored water; however its production was discontinued in the U.S. in late 2010. Other former products included &quot;Aquafina Alive&quot; (a low calorie, vitamin-enhanced water beverage introduced in 2007 and discontinued in 2009) and &quot;Aquafina plus+&quot; (a low calorie flavored water labeled as a vitamin supplement) – both of which have been discontinued in the U.S. As of 2011, the &quot;Sparkling&quot; and &quot;plus+&quot; lines were still in production in other markets such as Canada.

==Packaging==

Aquafina is distributed in , , , , , bottles. The bottled water industry has drawn criticism for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging, which consumes additional petrochemicals.

The packaging has evolved from its original iteration to partially offset the environmental impacts of production and shipment. This has primarily involved packaging weight reduction. The weight of Aquafina bottles was reduced by approximately 50%, to , with a packaging redesign in 2009 which, according to the company, resulted in the use of 75 million fewer pounds of plastic during the production process.

==Sponsorship==
Since shortly after its inception, the promotion of Aquafina has involved sports sponsorships. As of 2011, it is listed as being an official sponsor of Major League Soccer, the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America, the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Carolina Panthers and the New York Giants. Its packaging also states that it is the &quot;official water of Major League Baseball&quot;, which has been the case since the beginning of the 2008 MLB season. In NASCAR, it is a sponsor for Hendrick Motorsports and Kasey Kahne.

==Litigation==
Charles Joyce and James Voigt won a $1.26 billion judgment against PepsiCo after saying that the company had created Aquafina by stealing their idea to sell purified bottled water. This judgment was vacated on November 6, 2009, when it was discovered that PepsiCo had failed to respond to the lawsuit due to a misplacement of the paperwork.

<text>Year 449 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Third year of the decemviri and the Year of the Consulship of Potitus and Barbatus (or, less frequently, year 305 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 449 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* The Greek city-states make peace with the Persian Empire through the Peace of Callias, named after Callias II, the chief Greek ambassador to the Persian Court, an Athenian who is a brother-in-law of Cimon. Athens agrees to end its support for the Egyptian rebels still holding out in parts of the Nile Delta, while the Persians agree not to send ships of war into the Aegean Sea. Athens now effectively controls all the Greek city states in Ionia.
* Pericles begins a great building plan including the re-fortification of Athens main port Piraeus and its long walls extending to Athens main city.
* Pericles proposes a &quot;Congress Decree&quot; allowing the use of 9,000 talents to finance the massive rebuilding program of Athenian temples. This leads to a meeting (&quot;Congress&quot;) of all Greek states in order to consider the question of rebuilding the temples destroyed by the Persians. The Congress fails because of Sparta&#x27;s opposition.
* Pericles places the Athenian sculptor Phidias in charge of all the artistic aspects of his reconstruction program. Construction begins on the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, while the Athenian Senate commissions Callicrates to construct a temple to Athena Nike on the Acropolis.
* The Second Sacred War erupts between Athens and Sparta, when Sparta forcefully detaches Delphi from Phocis and renders it independent.

==== Rome ====
* The Law of the Twelve Tables (developed by the Decemvirates) is formally promulgated in 450 B.C. The Twelve Tables are literally drawn up on twelve ivory tablets which are posted in the Forum Romanum so that all Romans can read and know them.
* When the Decemvirate&#x27;s term of office expires, the decemviri refuse to leave office or permit successors to take office. Appius Claudius Crassus is said to have made an unjust decision which would have forced a young woman named Verginia into prostitution, prompting her father to kill her. This leads to an uprising against the Decemvirate forcing the decemviri to resign their offices. The ordinary magistrates (magistratus ordinarii) are re-instituted. Appius Claudius is said to have committed suicide as a result of these events.

<text>Year 315 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Cursor and Philo (or, less frequently, year 439 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 315 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==

<doc id="77127" wikidata="Q154655" url="?curid=77127" title="V. Gordon Childe">
<text>Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 189219 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialised in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London. He wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world.

Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe&#x27;s working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism. Instead, he worked for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the radical labour organisation Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent&#x27;s prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so, he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community.

From 1927 to 1946, he worked as the Abercromby Professor of Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, and then from 1947 to 1957 as the director of the Institute of Archaeology, London. During this period he oversaw the excavation of archaeological sites in Scotland and Northern Ireland, focusing on the society of Neolithic Orkney by excavating the settlement of Skara Brae and the chambered tombs of Maeshowe and Quoyness. In these decades he published prolifically, producing excavation reports, journal articles, and books. With Stuart Piggott and Grahame Clark he co-founded The Prehistoric Society in 1934, becoming its first president. Remaining a committed socialist, he embraced Marxism, and—rejecting culture-historical approaches—used Marxist ideas such as historical materialism as an interpretative framework for archaeological data. He became a sympathiser with the Soviet Union and visited the country on several occasions, although he grew sceptical of Soviet foreign policy following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. His beliefs resulted in him being legally barred from entering the United States, despite receiving repeated invitations to lecture there. Upon retirement, he returned to Australia&#x27;s Blue Mountains, where he committed suicide.

One of the best-known and most widely cited archaeologists of the twentieth century, Childe became known as the &quot;great synthesizer&quot; for his work integrating regional research with a broader picture of Near Eastern and European prehistory. He was also renowned for his emphasis on the role of revolutionary technological and economic developments in human society, such as the Neolithic Revolution and the Urban Revolution, reflecting the influence of Marxist ideas concerning societal development. Although many of his interpretations have since been discredited, he remains widely respected among archaeologists.

==Early life==
===Childhood: 1892–1910===

Childe was born on 14 April 1892 in Sydney. He was the only surviving child of the Reverend Stephen Henry Childe (1844–1923) and Harriet Eliza Childe, née Gordon (1853–1910), a middle-class couple of English descent. The son of an Anglican priest, Stephen Childe was ordained into the Church of England in 1867 after gaining a BA from the University of Cambridge. Becoming a teacher, in 1871 he married Mary Ellen Latchford, with whom he had five children. They moved to Australia in 1878, where Mary died. On 22 November 1886 Stephen married Harriet Gordon, an Englishwoman from a wealthy background who had moved to Australia as a child. Her father was Alexander Gordon. Gordon Childe was raised alongside five half-siblings at his father&#x27;s palatial country house, the Chalet Fontenelle, in the township of Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. Rev. Childe worked as the minister for St. Thomas&#x27; Parish, but proved unpopular, arguing with his congregation and taking unscheduled holidays.

A sickly child, Gordon Childe was educated at home for several years, before receiving a private-school education in North Sydney. In 1907, he began attending Sydney Church of England Grammar School, gaining his Junior Matriculation in 1909 and Senior Matriculation in 1910. At school he studied ancient history, French, Greek, Latin, geometry, algebra, and trigonometry, achieving good marks in all subjects, but he was bullied because of his physical appearance and unathletic physique. In July 1910 his mother died; his father soon remarried. Childe&#x27;s relationship with his father was strained, particularly following his mother&#x27;s death, and they disagreed on religion and politics: the Reverend was a devout Christian and conservative while his son was an atheist and socialist.

===University in Sydney and Oxford: 1911–1917===

Childe studied for a degree in classics at the University of Sydney in 1911; although focusing on written sources, he first came across classical archaeology through the work of the archaeologists Heinrich Schliemann and Arthur Evans. At university, he became an active member of the debating society, at one point arguing that &quot;socialism is desirable&quot;. Increasingly interested in socialism, he read the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, as well as those of the philosopher G. W. F. Hegel, whose dialectics heavily influenced Marxist theory. At university, he became a great friend of fellow undergraduate and future judge and politician Herbert Vere Evatt, with whom he remained in lifelong contact. Ending his studies in 1913, Childe graduated the following year with various honours and prizes, including Professor Francis Anderson&#x27;s prize for philosophy.
Wishing to continue his education, he gained a £200 Cooper Graduate Scholarship in Classics, allowing him to pay the tuition fees at Queen&#x27;s College, part of the University of Oxford, England. He set sail for Britain aboard the SS &quot;Orsova&quot; in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. At Queen&#x27;s, Childe was entered for a diploma in classical archaeology followed by a Literae Humaniores degree, although he never completed the former. While there, he studied under John Beazley and Arthur Evans, the latter being Childe&#x27;s supervisor. In 1915, he published his first academic paper, &quot;On the Date and Origin of Minyan Ware&quot;, in the &quot;Journal of Hellenic Studies&quot;, and the following year produced his B.Litt. thesis, &quot;The Influence of Indo-Europeans in Prehistoric Greece&quot;, displaying his interest in combining philological and archaeological evidence.

At Oxford he became actively involved with the socialist movement, antagonising the conservative university authorities. Becoming a noted member of the left-wing reformist Oxford University Fabian Society, he was there in 1915 when it changed its name to the Oxford University Socialist Society, following a split from the Fabian Society. His best friend and flatmate was Rajani Palme Dutt, a fervent socialist and Marxist. The pair often got drunk and tested each other&#x27;s knowledge about classical history late at night. With Britain in the midst of World War I, many British-based socialists refused to enlist in the military despite the government-mandated conscription. They believed the ruling classes of Europe&#x27;s imperialist nations were waging the war for their own interests at the expense of the working classes; these socialists thought class war was the only conflict they should be concerned with. Dutt was imprisoned for refusing to fight, and Childe campaigned for the release of both him and other socialists and pacifist conscientious objectors. Childe was never required to enlist in the military, most likely due to his poor health and eyesight. His anti-war sentiments concerned the authorities; the intelligence agency MI5 opening a file on him, his mail was intercepted, and he was kept under observation.

===Early career in Australia: 1918–1921===

Childe returned to Australia in August 1917. As a known socialist agitator, he was placed under surveillance by the security services, who intercepted his mail. In 1918 he became senior resident tutor at St Andrew&#x27;s College, Sydney University, joining Sydney&#x27;s socialist and anti-conscription movement. In Easter 1918 he spoke at the Third Inter-State Peace Conference, an event organised by the Australian Union of Democratic Control for the Avoidance of War, a group opposed to Prime Minister Billy Hughes&#x27;s plans to introduce conscription. The conference had a prominent socialist emphasis; its report argued that the best hope to end international war was the &quot;abolition of the Capitalist System&quot;. News of Childe&#x27;s participation reached the Principal of St Andrew&#x27;s College, who forced Childe to resign despite much opposition from staff.

Staff members secured him work as a tutor in ancient history in the Department of Tutorial Classes, but the university chancellor William Cullen feared that he would promote socialism to students and fired him. The leftist community condemned this as an infringement of Childe&#x27;s civil rights, and the centre-left politicians William McKell and T.J. Smith raised the issue in the Parliament of Australia. Moving to Maryborough, Queensland, in October 1918, Childe took up employment teaching Latin at the Maryborough Boys Grammar School, where his students included P. R. Stephensen. Here, too, his political affiliations became known, and he was subject to an opposition campaign from local conservative groups and the &quot;Maryborough Chronicle&quot;, resulting in abuse from some pupils. He soon resigned.

Realising he would be barred from an academic career by the university authorities, Childe sought employment within the leftist movement. In August 1919, he became private secretary and speech writer to the politician John Storey, a prominent member of the centre-left Labor Party then in opposition to New South Wales&#x27; Nationalist Party government. Representing the Sydney suburb of Balmain on the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Storey became state premier in 1920 when Labor achieved electoral victory. Working within the Labor Party allowed Childe greater insight into its workings; the deeper his involvement, the more he became critical of Labor, believing that once in political office they betrayed their socialist ideals and moved to a centrist, pro-capitalist stance. He joined the radical leftist Industrial Workers of the World, which at the time was banned in Australia. In 1921 Storey sent Childe to London to keep the British press updated about developments in New South Wales, but Storey died in December and an ensuing New South Wales election restored a Nationalist government under George Fuller&#x27;s premiership. Fuller thought Childe&#x27;s job unnecessary, and in early 1922 terminated his employment.

===London and early books: 1922–1926===

Unable to find an academic job in Australia, Childe remained in Britain, renting a room in Bloomsbury, Central London, and spending much time studying at the British Museum and the Royal Anthropological Institute library. An active member of London&#x27;s socialist movement, he associated with leftists at the 1917 Club in Gerrard Street, Soho. He befriended members of the Marxist Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and contributed to their publication, &quot;Labour Monthly&quot;, but had not yet openly embraced Marxism. Having earned a good reputation as a prehistorian, he was invited to other parts of Europe to study prehistoric artefacts. In 1922 he travelled to Vienna to examine unpublished material about the painted Neolithic pottery from Schipenitz, Bukovina, held in the Prehistoric Department of the Natural History Museum; he published his findings in the 1923 volume of the &quot;Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute&quot;. Childe used this excursion to visit museums in Czechoslovakia and Hungary, bringing them to the attention of British archaeologists in a 1922 article in &quot;Man&quot;. After returning to London, in 1922 Childe became a private secretary for three Members of Parliament, including John Hope Simpson and Frank Gray, both members of the centre-left Liberal Party. Supplementing this income, Childe worked as a translator for the publishers Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co. and occasionally lectured in prehistory at the London School of Economics.
In 1923 the London Labour Company published his first book, &quot;How Labour Governs&quot;. Examining the Australian Labor Party and its connections to the Australian labour movement, it reflects Childe&#x27;s disillusionment with the party, arguing that once elected, its politicians abandoned their socialist ideals in favour of personal comfort. Childe&#x27;s biographer Sally Green noted that &quot;How Labour Governs&quot; was of particular significance at the time because it was published just as the British Labour Party was emerging as a major player in British politics, threatening the two-party dominance of the Conservatives and Liberals; in 1923 Labour formed their first government. Childe planned a sequel expanding on his ideas, but it was never published.

In May 1923 he visited the museums in Lausanne, Bern, and Zürich to study their prehistoric artefact collections; that year he became a member of the Royal Anthropological Institute. In 1925, he became the institute&#x27;s librarian, one of the only archaeological jobs available in Britain, through which he began cementing connections with scholars across Europe. His job made him well known in Britain&#x27;s small archaeological community; he developed a great friendship with O. G. S. Crawford, the archaeological officer to the Ordnance Survey, influencing Crawford&#x27;s move toward socialism and Marxism.

In 1925, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co published Childe&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Dawn of European Civilisation&quot;, in which he synthesised the data about European prehistory that he had been exploring for several years. An important work, it was released when there were few professional archaeologists across Europe and most museums focused on their locality; &quot;The Dawn&quot; was a rare example that looked at the larger picture across the continent. Its importance was also due to the fact that it introduced the concept of the archaeological culture into Britain from continental scholarship, thereby aiding in the development of culture-historical archaeology. Childe later said the book &quot;aimed at distilling from archaeological remains a preliterate substitute for the conventional politico-military history with cultures, instead of statesmen, as actors, and migrations in place of battles&quot;. In 1926 he published a successor, &quot;The Aryans: A Study of Indo-European Origins&quot;, exploring the theory that civilisation diffused northward and westward into Europe from the Near East via an Indo-European linguistic group known as the Aryans; with the ensuing racial use of the term &quot;Aryan&quot; by the German Nazi Party, Childe avoided mention of the book. In these works, Childe accepted a moderate version of diffusionism, the idea that cultural developments diffuse from one place to others, rather than being independently developed in many places. In contrast to the hyper-diffusionism of Grafton Elliot Smith, Childe suggested that although most cultural traits spread from one society to another, it was possible for the same traits to develop independently in different places.

===Abercromby Professor of Archaeology: 1927–1946===

In 1927, the University of Edinburgh offered Childe the post of Abercromby Professor of Archaeology, a new position established in the bequest of the prehistorian Lord Abercromby. Although sad to leave London, Childe took the job, moving to Edinburgh in September 1927. Aged 35, Childe became the &quot;only academic prehistorian in a teaching post in Scotland&quot;. Many Scottish archaeologists disliked Childe, regarding him as an outsider with no specialism in Scottish prehistory; he wrote to a friend that &quot;I live here in an atmosphere of hatred and envy&quot;. He nevertheless made friends in Edinburgh, including archaeologists like W. Lindsay Scott, Alexander Curle, J. G. Callender, and Walter Grant, as well as non-archaeologists like the physicist Charles Galton Darwin, becoming godfather to Darwin&#x27;s youngest son. Initially lodging at Liberton, he moved into the semi-residential Hotel de Vere on Eglinton Crescent.

At Edinburgh University, Childe focused on research rather than teaching. He was reportedly kind to his students but had difficulty talking to large audiences; many students were confused that his BSc degree course in archaeology was structured counter-chronologically, dealing with the more recent Iron Age first before progressing backward to the Palaeolithic. Founding the Edinburgh League of Prehistorians, he took his more enthusiastic students on excavations and invited guest lecturers to visit. An early proponent of experimental archaeology, he involved his students in his experiments; in 1937 he used this method to investigate the vitrification process evident at several Iron Age forts in northern Britain.

Childe regularly travelled to London to visit friends, among whom was Stuart Piggott, another influential British archaeologist who succeeded Childe as Edinburgh&#x27;s Abercromby Professor. Another friend was Grahame Clark, whom Childe befriended and encouraged in his research. The trio were elected onto the committee of the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia. At Clark&#x27;s suggestion, in 1935 they used their influence to convert it into a nationwide organisation, the Prehistoric Society, of which Childe was elected president. Membership of the group grew rapidly; in 1935 it had 353 members and by 1938 it had 668.

Childe spent much time in continental Europe and attended many conferences there, having learned several European languages. In 1935, he first visited the Soviet Union, spending 12 days in Leningrad and Moscow; impressed with the socialist state, he was particularly interested in the social role of Soviet archaeology. Returning to Britain, he became a vocal Soviet sympathiser and avidly read the CPGB&#x27;s &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, although was heavily critical of certain Soviet policies, particularly the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany. His socialist convictions led to an early denunciation of European fascism, and he was outraged by the Nazi co-option of prehistoric archaeology to glorify their own conceptions of an Aryan racial heritage. Supportive of the British government&#x27;s decision to fight the fascist powers in the Second World War, he thought it probable that he was on a Nazi blacklist and made the decision to drown himself in a canal should the Nazis conquer Britain. Though opposing fascist Germany and Italy, he also criticised the imperialist, capitalist governments of the United Kingdom and United States: he repeatedly described the latter as being full of &quot;loathsome fascist hyenas&quot;. This did not prevent him from visiting the U.S. In 1936 he addressed a Conference of Arts and Sciences marking the tercentenary of Harvard University; there, the university awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree. He returned in 1939, lecturing at Harvard, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Pennsylvania.

====Excavations====

Childe&#x27;s university position meant he was obliged to undertake archaeological excavations, something he loathed and believed he did poorly. Students agreed, but recognised his &quot;genius for interpreting evidence&quot;. Unlike many contemporaries, he was scrupulous with writing up and publishing his findings, producing almost annual reports for the &quot;Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland&quot; and, unusually, ensuring that he acknowledged the help of every digger.

His best-known excavation was undertaken from 1928 to 1930 at Skara Brae in the Orkney Islands. Having uncovered a well-preserved Neolithic village, in 1931 he published the excavation results in a book titled &quot;Skara Brae&quot;. He made an error of interpretation, erroneously attributing the site to the Iron Age. During the excavation, Childe got on particularly well with the locals; for them, he was &quot;every inch the professor&quot; because of his eccentric appearance and habits. In 1932, Childe, collaborating with the anthropologist C. Daryll Forde, excavated two Iron Age hillforts at Earn&#x27;s Hugh on the Berwickshire coast, while in June 1935 he excavated a promontory fort at Larriban near to Knocksoghey in Northern Ireland. Together with Wallace Thorneycroft, another Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, Childe excavated two vitrified Iron Age forts in Scotland, at Finavon, Angus (1933–34) and at Rahoy, Argyllshire (1936–37). In 1938, he and Walter Grant oversaw excavations at the Neolithic settlement of Rinyo; their investigation ceased during the Second World War, but resumed in 1946.

====Publications====

Childe continued writing and publishing books on archaeology, beginning with a series of works following on from &quot;The Dawn of European Civilisation&quot; and &quot;The Aryans&quot; by compiling and synthesising data from across Europe. First was &quot;The Most Ancient Near East&quot; (1928), which assembled information from across Mesopotamia and India, setting a background from which the spread of farming and other technologies into Europe could be understood. This was followed by &quot;The Danube in Prehistory&quot; (1929) which examined the archaeology along the Danube river, recognising it as the natural boundary dividing the Near East from Europe; Childe believed it was via the Danube that new technologies travelled westward. Although Childe had used culture-historical approaches in earlier publications, &quot;The Danube in Prehistory&quot; was his first publication to provide a specific definition of the concept of an archaeological culture, revolutionising the theoretical approach of British archaeology.
Childe&#x27;s next book, &quot;The Bronze Age&quot; (1930), dealt with the Bronze Age in Europe, and displayed his increasing adoption of Marxist theory as a means of understanding how society functioned and changed. He believed metal was the first indispensable article of commerce, and that metal-smiths were therefore full-time professionals who lived off the social surplus. In 1933, Childe travelled to Asia, visiting Iraq—a place he thought &quot;great fun&quot;—and India, which he felt was &quot;detestable&quot; due to the hot weather and extreme poverty. Touring archaeological sites in the two countries, he opined that much of what he had written in &quot;The Most Ancient Near East&quot; was outdated, going on to produce &quot;New Light on the Most Ancient Near East&quot; (1935), in which he applied his Marxist-influenced ideas about the economy to his conclusions.

After publishing &quot;Prehistory of Scotland&quot; (1935), Childe produced one of the defining books of his career, &quot;Man Makes Himself&quot; (1936). Influenced by Marxist views of history, Childe argued that the usual distinction between (pre-literate) prehistory and (literate) history was a false dichotomy and human society has progressed through a series of technological, economic, and social revolutions. These included the Neolithic Revolution, when hunter-gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities, through to the Urban Revolution, when society moved from small towns to the first cities, and up to more recent times, when the Industrial Revolution changed the nature of production.

After the outbreak of the Second World War, Childe was unable to travel across Europe, instead focusing on writing &quot;Prehistoric Communities of the British Isles&quot; (1940). Childe&#x27;s pessimism regarding the war&#x27;s outcome led him to believe that &quot;European civilization—capitalist and Stalinist alike—was irrevocably headed for a Dark Age&quot;. In this state of mind he produced a sequel to &quot;Man Makes Himself&quot; titled &quot;What Happened in History&quot; (1942), an account of human history from the Palaeolithic through to the fall of the Roman Empire. Although Oxford University Press offered to publish the work, he released it through Penguin Books because they could sell it at a cheaper price, something he believed pivotal in providing knowledge for those he called &quot;the masses&quot;. This was followed by two short works, &quot;Progress and Archaeology&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Story of Tools&quot; (1944), the latter an explicitly Marxist text written for the Young Communist League.

===Institute of Archaeology, London: 1946–1956===

In 1946, Childe left Edinburgh to take up the position as director and professor of European prehistory at the Institute of Archaeology (IOA) in London. Anxious to return to London, he had kept silent over his disapproval of government policies so he would not be prevented from getting the job. He took up residence in the Isokon building near to Hampstead.

Located in St John&#x27;s Lodge in the Inner Circle of Regent&#x27;s Park, the IOA was founded in 1937, largely by the archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler, but until 1946 relied primarily on volunteer lecturers. Childe&#x27;s relationship with the conservative Wheeler was strained, for their personalities were very different; Wheeler was an extrovert who pursued the limelight, was an efficient administrator, and was intolerant of others&#x27; shortcomings, while Childe lacked administrative skill, and was tolerant of others. Childe was popular among the institute&#x27;s students, who saw him as a kindly eccentric; they commissioned a bust of Childe from Marjorie Maitland Howard. His lecturing was nevertheless considered poor, as he often mumbled and walked into an adjacent room to find something while continuing to talk. He further confused his students by referring to the socialist states of eastern Europe by their full official titles, and by referring to towns by their Slavonic names rather than the names with which they were better known in English. He was deemed better at giving tutorials and seminars, where he devoted more time to interacting with his students. As Director, Childe was not obliged to excavate, though he did undertake projects at the Orkney Neolithic burial tombs of Quoyness (1951) and Maes Howe (1954–55).

In 1949, he and Crawford resigned as fellows of the Society of Antiquaries. They did so to protest the selection of James Mann—keeper of the Tower of London&#x27;s armouries—as the society&#x27;s president, believing Wheeler (a professional archaeologist) was a better choice. Childe joined the editorial board of the periodical &quot;Past &amp; Present&quot;, founded by Marxist historians in 1952. During the early 1950s, he also became a board member for &quot;The Modern Quarterly&quot;—later &quot;The Marxist Quarterly&quot;—working alongside the board&#x27;s chairman Rajani Palme Dutt, his best friend and flatmate from his Oxford days. He authored occasional articles for Palme Dutt&#x27;s socialist journal, the &quot;Labour Monthly&quot;, but disagreed with him over the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; Palme Dutt defended the Soviet Union&#x27;s decision to quash the revolution using military force, but Childe, like many Western socialists, strongly opposed it. The event made Childe abandon faith in the Soviet leadership, but not in socialism or Marxism. He retained a love of the Soviet Union, having visiting on multiple occasions; he was also involved with a CPGB satellite body, the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR, and served as president of its National History and Archaeology Section from the early 1950s until his death.

In April 1956, Childe was awarded the Gold Medal of the Society of Antiquaries for his services to archaeology. He was invited to lecture in the United States on multiple occasions, by Robert Braidwood, William Duncan Strong, and Leslie White, but the U.S. State Department barred him from entering the country due to his Marxist beliefs. While working at the institute, Childe continued writing and publishing books dealing with archaeology. &quot;History&quot; (1947) promoted a Marxist view of the past and reaffirmed Childe&#x27;s belief that prehistory and literate history must be viewed together, while &quot;Prehistoric Migrations&quot; (1950) displayed his views on moderate diffusionism. In 1946 he also published a paper in the &quot;Southwestern Journal of Anthropology&quot;. This was &quot;Archaeology and Anthropology&quot;, which argued that the disciplines of archaeology and anthropology should be used in tandem, an approach that would be widely accepted in the decades following his death.

===Retirement and death: 1956–1957===

In mid-1956, Childe retired as IOA director a year prematurely. European archaeology had rapidly expanded during the 1950s, leading to increasing specialisation and making the synthesising that Childe was known for increasingly difficult. That year, the institute was moving to Gordon Square, Bloomsbury, and Childe wanted to give his successor, W.F. Grimes, a fresh start in the new surroundings. To commemorate his achievements, the &quot;Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society&quot; published a &quot;Festschrift&quot; edition on the last day of his directorship containing contributions from friends and colleagues all over the world, something that touched Childe deeply. Upon his retirement, he told many friends he planned to return to Australia, visit his relatives, and commit suicide; he was terrified of becoming old, senile, and a burden on society, and suspected he had cancer. Subsequent commentators suggested that a core reason for his suicidal desires was a loss of faith in Marxism following the Hungarian Revolution and Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s denouncement of Joseph Stalin, although Bruce Trigger dismissed this explanation, noting that while Childe was critical of Soviet foreign policy, he never saw the state and Marxism as synonymous.
Sorting out his affairs, Childe donated most of his library and all of his estate to the institute. After a February 1957 holiday visiting archaeological sites in Gibraltar and Spain, he sailed to Australia, reaching Sydney on his 65th birthday. Here, the University of Sydney, which had once barred him from working there, awarded him an honorary degree. He travelled around the country for six months, visiting family members and old friends, but was unimpressed by Australian society, believing it reactionary, increasingly suburban, and poorly educated. Looking into Australian prehistory, he found it a profitable field for research, and lectured to archaeological and leftist groups on this and other topics, taking to Australian radio to criticise academic racism towards Indigenous Australians.

Writing personal letters to many friends, he sent one to Grimes, requesting that it not be opened until 1968. In it, he described how he feared old age and stated his intention to take his own life, remarking that &quot;life ends best when one is happy and strong&quot;. On 19 October 1957, Childe went to the area of Govett&#x27;s Leap in Blackheath, an area of the Blue Mountains where he had grown up. Leaving his hat, spectacles, compass, pipe, and Mackintosh raincoat on the cliffs, he fell 1000 feet (300 m) to his death. A coroner ruled his death as accidental, but his death was recognised as suicide when his letter to Grimes was published in the 1980s. His remains were cremated at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium, and his name added to a small family plaque in the Crematorium Gardens. Following his death, an &quot;unprecedented&quot; level of tributes and memorials were issued by the archaeological community, all, according to Ruth Tringham, testifying to his status as Europe&#x27;s &quot;greatest prehistorian and a wonderful human being&quot;.

==Archaeological theory==

The biographer Sally Green noted that Childe&#x27;s beliefs were &quot;never dogmatic, always idiosyncratic&quot; and &quot;continually changing throughout his life&quot;.
His theoretical approach blended together Marxism, diffusionism, and functionalism. Childe was critical of the evolutionary archaeology dominant during the nineteenth century. He believed archaeologists who adhered to it placed a greater emphasis on artefacts than on the humans who had made them. Like most archaeologists in Western Europe and the United States at the time, Childe did not regard humans as naturally inventive or inclined to change; thus, he tended to perceive social change in terms of diffusion and migration rather than internal development or cultural evolution.

During the decades in which Childe was working, most archaeologists adhered to the three-age system first developed by the Danish antiquarian Christian Jürgensen Thomsen. This system rested upon an evolutionary chronology that divided prehistory into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, but Childe highlighted that many of the world&#x27;s societies were still effectively Stone Age in their technology. He nevertheless saw it as a useful model for analysing socio-economic development when combined with a Marxist framework. He therefore used technological criteria for dividing up prehistory into three ages, but instead used economic criteria for sub-dividing the Stone Age into the Palaeolithic and Neolithic, rejecting the concept of the Mesolithic as useless. Informally, he adopted the division of past societies into the framework of &quot;savagery&quot;, &quot;barbarism&quot;, and &quot;civilisation&quot; that Engels had employed.

===Culture-historical archaeology===

In the early part of his career, Childe was a proponent of the culture-historical approach to archaeology, coming to be seen as one of its &quot;founders and chief exponents&quot;. Culture-historical archaeology revolved around the concept of &quot;culture&quot;, which it had adopted from anthropology. This was &quot;a major turning point in the history of the discipline&quot;, allowing archaeologists to look at the past through a spatial dynamic rather than a temporal one. Childe adopted the concept of &quot;culture&quot; from the German philologist and archaeologist Gustaf Kossinna, although this influence might have been mediated through Leon Kozłowski, a Polish archaeologist who had adopted Kossina&#x27;s ideas and who had a close association with Childe. Trigger expressed the view that while adopting Kossina&#x27;s basic concept, Childe displayed &quot;no awareness&quot; of the &quot;racist connotations&quot; Kossina had given it.

Childe&#x27;s adherence to the culture-historical model is apparent in three of his books—&quot;The Dawn of European Civilisation&quot; (1925), &quot;The Aryans&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Most Ancient East&quot; (1928)—but in none of these does he define what he means by &quot;culture&quot;. Only later, in &quot;The Danube in Prehistory&quot; (1929), did Childe give &quot;culture&quot; a specifically archaeological definition. In this book, he defined a &quot;culture&quot; as a set of &quot;regularly associated traits&quot; in the material culture—i.e. &quot;pots, implements, ornaments, burial rites, house forms&quot;—that recur across a given area. He said that in this respect a &quot;culture&quot; was the archaeological equivalent of a &quot;people&quot;. Childe&#x27;s use of the term was non-racial; he considered a &quot;people&quot; to be a social grouping, not a biological race. He opposed the equation of archaeological cultures with biological races—as various nationalists across Europe were doing at the time—and vociferously criticised Nazi uses of archaeology, arguing that the Jewish people were not a distinct biological race but a socio-cultural grouping. In 1935, he suggested that culture worked as a &quot;living functioning organism&quot; and emphasised the adaptive potential of material culture; in this he was influenced by anthropological functionalism. Childe accepted that archaeologists defined &quot;cultures&quot; based on a subjective selection of material criteria; this view was later widely adopted by archaeologists like Colin Renfrew.

Later in his career, Childe tired of culture-historical archaeology. By the late 1940s he was questioning the utility of &quot;culture&quot; as an archaeological concept and thus the basic validity of the culture-historical approach. McNairn suggested that this was because the term &quot;culture&quot; had become popular across the social sciences in reference to all learned modes of behaviour, and not just material culture as Childe had done. By the 1940s, Childe was doubtful as to whether a certain archaeological assemblage or &quot;culture&quot; really reflected a social group who had other unifying traits, such as a shared language. In the 1950s, Childe was comparing the role culture-historical archaeology had among prehistorians to the place of the traditional politico-military approach among historians.

===Marxist archaeology===

Childe has typically been seen as a Marxist archaeologist, being the first archaeologist in the West to use Marxist theory in his work. Marxist archaeology emerged in the Soviet Union in 1929, when the archaeologist Vladislav I. Ravdonikas published a report titled &quot;For a Soviet History of Material Culture&quot;. Criticising the archaeological discipline as inherently bourgeois and therefore anti-socialist, Ravdonikas&#x27;s report called for a pro-socialist, Marxist approach to archaeology as part of the academic reforms instituted under Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule. It was during the mid-1930s, around the time of his first visit to the Soviet Union, that Childe began to make explicit reference to Marxism in his work.

Many archaeologists have been profoundly influenced by Marxism&#x27;s socio-political ideas. As a materialist philosophy, Marxism emphasises the idea that material things are more important than ideas, and that the social conditions of a given period are the result of the existing material conditions, or mode of production. Thus, a Marxist interpretation foregrounds the social context of any technological development or change. Marxist ideas also emphasise the biased nature of scholarship, each scholar having their own entrenched beliefs and class loyalties; Marxism thus argues that intellectuals cannot divorce their scholarly thinking from political action. Green said that Childe accepted &quot;Marxist views on a model of the past&quot; because they offer &quot;a structural analysis of culture in terms of economy, sociology and ideology, and a principle for cultural change through economy&quot;. McNairn noted that Marxism was &quot;a major intellectual force in Childe&#x27;s thought&quot;, while Trigger said Childe identified with Marx&#x27;s theories &quot;both emotionally and intellectually&quot;.

Childe said he used Marxist ideas when interpreting the past &quot;because and in so far as it &quot;works&quot;&quot;; he criticised many fellow Marxists for treating the socio-political theory as a set of dogmas. Childe&#x27;s Marxism often differed from the Marxism of his contemporaries, both because he made reference to the original texts of Hegel, Marx, and Engels rather than later interpretations and because he was selective in using their writings. McNairn considered Childe&#x27;s Marxism &quot;an individual interpretation&quot; that differed from &quot;popular or orthodox&quot; Marxism; Trigger called him a &quot;a creative Marxist thinker&quot;; Gathercole thought that while Childe&#x27;s &quot;debt to Marx was quite evident&quot;, his &quot;attitude to Marxism was at times ambivalent&quot;. The Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm later described Childe as &quot;the most original English Marxist writer from the days of my youth&quot;. Aware that in the context of the Cold War his affiliation with Marxism could prove dangerous for him, Childe sought to make his Marxist ideas more palatable to his readership. In his archaeological writings, he sparingly made direct reference to Marx. There is a distinction in his published works from the latter part of his life between those that are explicitly Marxist and those in which Marxist ideas and influences are less obvious. Many of Childe&#x27;s fellow British archaeologists did not take his adherence to Marxism seriously, regarding it as something which he did for shock value.
Childe was influenced by Soviet archaeology but remained critical of it, disapproving of how the Soviet government encouraged the country&#x27;s archaeologists to assume their conclusions before analysing their data. He was also critical of what he saw as the sloppy approach to typology in Soviet archaeology. As a moderate diffusionist, Childe was heavily critical of the &quot;Marrist&quot; trend in Soviet archaeology, based on the theories of the Georgian philologist Nicholas Marr, which rejected diffusionism in favour of unilinear evolutionism. In his view, it &quot;cannot be un-Marxian&quot; to understand the spread of domesticated plants, animals, and ideas through diffusionism. Childe did not publicly air these criticisms of his Soviet colleagues, perhaps so as not to offend communist friends or to provide ammunition for right-wing archaeologists. Instead, he publicly praised the Soviet system of archaeology and heritage management, contrasting it favourably with Britain&#x27;s because it encouraged collaboration rather than competition between archaeologists. After first visiting the country in 1935, he returned in 1945, 1953, and 1956, befriending many Soviet archaeologists, but shortly before his suicide sent a letter to the Soviet archaeological community saying he was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; they had methodologically fallen behind Western Europe and North America.

Other Marxists—such as George Derwent Thomson and Neil Faulkner—argued that Childe&#x27;s archaeological work was not truly Marxist because he failed to take into account class struggle as an instrument of social change, a core tenet of Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor Childe considered in his archaeological work, he accepted that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, arguing that most of his contemporaries produced studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe further diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology. He also denied Marxism&#x27;s ability to predict the future development of human society, and—unlike many other Marxists—did not consider humanity&#x27;s progress into pure communism inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilise or become extinct.

===Neolithic and Urban Revolutions===

Influenced by Marxism, Childe argued that society experienced widescale changes in relatively short periods of time, citing the Industrial Revolution as a modern example. This idea was absent from his earliest work; in studies like &quot;The Dawn of European Civilisation&quot; he talked of societal change as &quot;transition&quot; rather than &quot;revolution&quot;. In writings from the early 1930s, such as &quot;New Light on the Most Ancient East&quot;, he began to describe social change using the term &quot;revolution&quot;, although had yet to fully develop these ideas. At this point, the term &quot;revolution&quot; had gained Marxist associations due to Russia&#x27;s October Revolution of 1917. Childe introduced his ideas about &quot;revolutions&quot; in a 1935 presidential address to the Prehistoric Society. Presenting this concept as part of his functional-economic interpretation of the three-age system, he argued that a &quot;Neolithic Revolution&quot; initiated the Neolithic era, and that other revolutions marked the start of the Bronze and Iron Ages. The following year, in &quot;Man Makes Himself&quot;, he combined these Bronze and Iron Age Revolutions into a singular &quot;Urban Revolution&quot;, which corresponded largely to the anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan&#x27;s concept of &quot;civilization&quot;.

For Childe, the Neolithic Revolution was a period of radical change, in which humans—who were then hunter-gatherers—began cultivating plants and breeding animals for food, allowing for greater control of the food supply and population growth. He believed the Urban Revolution was largely caused by the development of bronze metallurgy, and in a 1950 paper proposed ten traits that he believed were present in the oldest cities: they were larger than earlier settlements, they contained full-time craft specialists, the surplus was collected together and given to a god or king, they witnessed monumental architecture, there was an unequal distribution of social surplus, writing was invented, the sciences developed, naturalistic art developed, trade with foreign areas increased, and the state organisation was based on residence rather than kinship. Childe believed the Urban Revolution had a negative side, in that it led to increased social stratification into classes and oppression of the majority by a power elite. Not all archaeologists adopted Childe&#x27;s framework of understanding human societal development as a series of transformational &quot;revolutions&quot;; many believed the term &quot;revolution&quot; was misleading because the processes of agricultural and urban development were gradual transformations.

===Influence on processual and post-processual archaeology===

Through his work, Childe contributed to two of the major theoretical movements in Anglo-American archaeology that developed in the decades after his death, processualism and post-processualism. The former emerged in the late 1950s, emphasised the idea that archaeology should be a branch of anthropology, sought the discovery of universal laws about society, and believed that archaeology could ascertain objective information about the past. The latter emerged as a reaction to processualism in the late 1970s, rejecting the idea that archaeology had access to objective information about the past and emphasising the subjectivity of all interpretation.

The processual archaeologist Colin Renfrew described Childe as &quot;one of the fathers of processual thought&quot; due to his &quot;development of economic and social themes in prehistory&quot;, an idea echoed by Faulkner. Trigger argued that Childe&#x27;s work foreshadowed processual thought in two ways: by emphasising the role of change in societal development, and by adhering to a strictly materialist view of the past. Both of these arose from Childe&#x27;s Marxism. Despite this connection, most American processualists ignored Childe&#x27;s work, seeing him as a particularist who was irrelevant to their search for generalised laws of societal behaviour. In keeping with Marxist thought, Childe did not agree that such generalised laws exist, believing behaviour is not universal but conditioned by socio-economic factors. Peter Ucko, one of Childe&#x27;s successors as director of the Institute of Archaeology, highlighted that Childe accepted the subjectivity of archaeological interpretation, something in stark contrast to the processualists&#x27; insistence that archaeological interpretation could be objective. As a result, Trigger thought Childe to be a &quot;prototypical post-processual archaeologist&quot;.

==Personal life==

Childe&#x27;s biographer Sally Green found no evidence that Childe ever had a serious intimate relationship; she assumed he was heterosexual because she found no evidence of same-sex attraction. Conversely, his student Don Brothwell thought him to be homosexual. He had many friends of both sexes, although he remained &quot;awkward and uncouth, without any social graces&quot;. Despite his difficulties in relating to others, he enjoyed interacting and socialising with his students, often inviting them to dine with him. He was shy and often hid his personal feelings. Brothwell suggested that these personality traits may reflect undiagnosed Asperger syndrome.

Childe believed the study of the past could offer guidance for how humans should act in the present and future. He was known for his radical left-wing views, being a socialist from his undergraduate days. He sat on the committees of several left-wing groups, although avoided involvement in Marxist intellectual arguments within the Communist Party and—with the exception of &quot;How Labour Governs&quot;—did not commit his non-archaeological opinions to print. Many of his political views are therefore evident only through comments made in private correspondence. Renfrew noted that Childe was liberal-minded on social issues, but thought that—although Childe deplored racism—he did not entirely escape the pervasive nineteenth-century view on distinct differences between different races. Trigger similarly observed racist elements in some of Childe&#x27;s culture-historical writings, including the suggestion that Nordic peoples had a &quot;superiority in physique&quot;, although Childe later disavowed these ideas. In a private letter, Childe wrote to the archaeologist Christopher Hawkes, he said he disliked Jews.

Childe was an atheist and critic of religion, viewing it as a false consciousness based in superstition that served the interests of dominant elites. In &quot;History&quot; (1947) he commented that &quot;magic is a way of making people believe they are going to get what they want, whereas religion is a system for persuading them that they ought to want what they get&quot;. He nevertheless regarded Christianity as being superior over (what he regarded as) primitive religion, commenting that &quot;Christianity as a religion of love surpasses all others in stimulating positive virtue&quot;. In a letter written during the 1930s, he said that &quot;only in days of exceptional bad temper do I desire to hurt people&#x27;s religious convictions&quot;.

Childe was fond of driving cars, enjoying the &quot;feeling of power&quot; he got from them. He often told a story about how he had raced at high speed down Piccadilly, London, at three in the morning for the sheer enjoyment of it, only to be pulled over by a policeman. He loved practical jokes, and allegedly kept a halfpenny in his pocket to trick pickpockets. On one occasion he played a joke on the delegates at a Prehistoric Society conference by lecturing them on a theory that the Neolithic monument of Woodhenge had been constructed as an imitation of Stonehenge by a &quot;nouveau riche&quot; chieftain. Some audience members failed to realise he was being tongue in cheek. He could speak several European languages, having taught himself in early life when he was travelling across the continent.

Childe&#x27;s other hobbies included walking in the British hillsides, attending classical music concerts, and playing the card game contract bridge. He was fond of poetry; his favourite poet was John Keats, and his favourite poems were William Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Duty&quot; and Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;A Grammarian&#x27;s Funeral&quot;. He was not particularly interested in reading novels, but his favourite was D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Kangaroo&quot; (1923), a book echoing many of Childe&#x27;s own feelings about Australia. He was a fan of good quality food and drink, and frequented restaurants. Known for his battered, tatty attire, Childe always wore his wide-brimmed black hat—purchased from a hatter in Jermyn Street, central London—as well as a tie, which was usually red, a colour chosen to symbolise his socialist beliefs. He regularly wore a black Mackintosh raincoat, often carrying it over his arm or draped over his shoulders like a cape. In summer he frequently wore shorts with socks, sock suspenders, and large boots.

==Legacy and influence==

On his death, Childe was praised by his colleague Stuart Piggott as &quot;the greatest prehistorian in Britain and probably the world&quot;. The archaeologist Randall H. McGuire later described him as &quot;probably the best known and most cited archaeologist of the twentieth century&quot;, an idea echoed by Bruce Trigger, while Barbara McNairn labelled him &quot;one of the most outstanding and influential figures in the discipline&quot;. The archaeologist Andrew Sherratt described Childe as occupying &quot;a crucial position in the history&quot; of archaeology.
Sherratt also noted that &quot;Childe&#x27;s output, by any standard, was massive&quot;. Over the course of his career, Childe published more than twenty books and around 240 scholarly articles. The archaeologist Brian Fagan described his books as &quot;simple, well-written narratives&quot; which became &quot;archaeological canon between the 1930s and early 1960s&quot;. By 1956, he was cited as the most translated Australian author in history, having seen his books published in such languages as Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Sweden and Turkish. The archaeologists David Lewis-Williams and David Pearce considered Childe &quot;probably the most written about&quot; archaeologist in history, commenting that his books were still &quot;required reading&quot; for those in the discipline in 2005. As of 2024, the University of Sydney named the Vere Gordon Childe Centre in his honour.
Known as &quot;the Great Synthesizer&quot;, Childe is primarily respected for developing a synthesis of European and Near Eastern prehistory at a time when most archaeologists focused on regional sites and sequences. Since his death, this framework has been heavily revised following the discovery of radiocarbon dating, his interpretations have been &quot;largely rejected&quot;, and many of his conclusions about Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe have been found to be incorrect. Childe himself believed his primary contribution to archaeology was in his interpretative frameworks, an analysis supported by Alison Ravetz and Peter Gathercole. According to Sherratt: &quot;What is of lasting value in his interpretations is the more detailed level of writing, concerned with the recognition of patterns in the material he described. It is these patterns which survive as classic problems of European prehistory, even when his explanations of them are recognised as inappropriate&quot;. Childe&#x27;s theoretical work had been largely ignored in his lifetime, and remained forgotten in the decades after his death, although it would see a resurgence in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It remained best known in Latin America, where Marxism remained a core theoretical current among archaeologists throughout the latter 20th century.

Despite his global influence, Childe&#x27;s work was poorly understood in the United States, where his work on European prehistory never became well known. As a result, in the United States he erroneously gained the reputation of being a Near Eastern specialist and a founder of neo-evolutionism, alongside Julian Steward and Leslie White, despite the fact that his approach was &quot;more subtle and nuanced&quot; than theirs. Steward repeatedly misrepresented Childe as a unilinear evolutionist in his writings, perhaps as part of an attempt to distinguish his own &quot;multilinear&quot; evolutionary approach from the ideas of Marx and Engels. In contrast to this American neglect and misrepresentation, Trigger believed it was an American archaeologist, Robert McCormick Adams, Jr., who did the most to posthumously develop Childe&#x27;s &quot;most innovative ideas&quot;. Childe also had a small following of American archaeologists and anthropologists in the 1940s who wanted to bring back materialist and Marxist ideas into their research after years in which Boasian particularism had been dominant within the discipline. In the U.S., his name was also referenced in the 2008 blockbuster film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;.

===Academic conferences and publications===

Following his death, several articles examining Childe&#x27;s impact on archaeology were published. In 1980, Bruce Trigger&#x27;s &quot;Gordon Childe: Revolutions in Archaeology&quot; appeared, which studied the influences that extended over Childe&#x27;s archaeological thought; the same year saw the publication of Barbara McNairn&#x27;s &quot;The Method and Theory of V. Gordon Childe&quot;, examining his methodological and theoretical approaches to archaeology. The following year, Sally Green published &quot;Prehistorian: A Biography of V. Gordon Childe&quot;, in which she described him as &quot;the most eminent and influential scholar of European prehistory in the twentieth century&quot;. Peter Gathercole thought the work of Trigger, McNairn, and Green was &quot;extremely important&quot;; Tringham considered it all part of a &quot;let&#x27;s-get-to-know-Childe-better&quot; movement.

In July 1986, a colloquium devoted to Childe&#x27;s work was held in Mexico City, marking the 50th anniversary of &quot;Man Makes Himself&quot;&#x27;s publication. In September 1990, the University of Queensland&#x27;s Australian Studies Centre organised a centenary conference for Childe in Brisbane, with presentations examining both his scholarly and his socialist work. In May 1992, a conference marking his centenary was held at the UCL Institute of Archaeology in London, co-sponsored by the Institute and the Prehistoric Society, both organisations he had formerly headed. The conference proceedings were published in a 1994 volume edited by David R. Harris, the Institute&#x27;s director, entitled &quot;The Archaeology of V. Gordon Childe: Contemporary Perspectives&quot;. Harris said the book sought to &quot;demonstrate the dynamic qualities of Childe&#x27;s thought, the breadth and depth of his scholarship, and the continuing relevance of his work to contemporary issues in archaeology&quot;. In 1995, another conference collection was published. Titled &quot;Childe and Australia: Archaeology, Politics and Ideas&quot;, it was edited by Peter Gathercole, T. H. Irving, and Gregory Melleuish. Further papers appeared on the subject of Childe in ensuing years, looking at such subjects as his personal correspondences, and final resting place.

<text>Year 319 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Cursor and Cerretanus (or, less frequently, year 435 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 319 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Macedonian Empire ====
* Battle of Orkynia: Antigonus marches his army against Eumenes in Cappadocia and defeats him in battle at Orkynia.
* Eumenes retreats to the fortress of Nora. Antigonus follows him there and starts a siege.
*Battle of Cretopolis: Antigonus leaves a small force to besiege Eumenes, marches with the rest of his army against the remnants of the Perdiccan faction and defeats them at Cretopolis.
* The Athenian orator and diplomat, Demades, is sent to the Macedonian court, but either the Macedonian regent Antipater or his son Cassander, learning that Demades has intrigued with the former regent Perdiccas, puts him to death.
* Antipater becomes ill and dies shortly after, leaving the regency of the Macedonian Empire to the aged Polyperchon, passing over his son Cassander, a measure which gives rise to much confusion and ill-feeling.
* Polyperchon&#x27;s authority is challenged by Antipater&#x27;s son Cassander, who refuses to acknowledge the new regent. With the aid of Antigonus, ruler of Phrygia, and with the support of Ptolemy and Lysimachus, Cassander seizes most of Greece including Macedonia.
* Eumenes allies himself with the regent Polyperchon. He manages to escape from the siege of Nora, and his forces soon threaten Syria and Phoenicia. Polyperchon recognises Eumenes as the royal general in Asia Minor.
* Alexander the Great&#x27;s widow, Roxana, joins Alexander&#x27;s mother, Olympias, in Epirus.

== Births ==
* Antigonus II Gonatas, Macedonian king (approximate date) (d. 239 BC)
* Pyrrhus of Epirus, King of the Molossians, Epirus and Macedonia (d. 272 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Antipater, Macedonian general, regent of Alexander the Great&#x27;s empire (b. 397 BC)

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Macedonian Empire ====
* Antigonus resolves to become lord of all Asia, and in conjunction with Cassander and Ptolemy. He enters into negotiations with Eumenes; but Eumenes remains faithful to the royal house. He raises an army and forms a coalition with the satraps of the eastern provinces. He then captures Babylon from Antigonus.
* Antigonus marches against Eumenes, so Eumenes withdraws east to join the satraps of the provinces beyond the Tigris River.
* Cassander, who has allied himself with Ptolemy and Antigonus, declares war on the regent, Polyperchon. Most of the Greek states support him, including Athens. Cassander further effects an alliance with Eurydice, the ambitious wife of King Philip III Arrhidaeus of Macedon.
* Although Polyperchon is initially successful in securing control of the Greek cities, whose freedom he proclaims, his fleet is destroyed by Antigonus.

==== Greece ====
* In a power struggle in Athens after the death of Antipater, Phocion is deposed as the ruler of Athens, convicted of treason, and executed by those Athenians hoping to restore democracy to the city. Shortly afterward, the Athenians decree a public burial and a statue in his honor.

The two fleets meet in near Byzantium, Cleitus wins a victory in which some 70 ships of Nicanor are captured, sunk or disabled, the remnant excaping to Chalcedon, where they are joined by Antigonus and his army. Antigonus orders the remaining 60 ships to be readied for renewed action, and assigns his strongest and most loyal soldiers as marines to these ships. Meanwhile, the Byzantines transport his archers, slingers and peltast to the European shore, where Cleitus&#x27;s victorious forces were encamped. At dawn the next day Antigonus launches an assault by land and sea and catches Cleitus completely by surprise; Cleitus’s entire force is captured or killed.

==== Macedonian Empire ====
* Eumenes and Antigonus, rivals to Cassander for control of Macedonia, meet in the Battle of Gabiene in Media to the northeast of Susa. Antigonus defeats Eumenes, with the aid of Seleucus and Peithon (the satraps of Babylonia and Media, respectively). The result is inconclusive. However, some of Eumenes&#x27; soldiers take matters into their own hands. Learning that Antigonus has captured many of their wives, children and the cumulative plunder of nearly 40 years of continuous warfare, they secretly open negotiations with Antigonus for their safe return. They hand over Eumenes and his senior officers to Antigonus in return for their baggage and families. Eumenes is put to death by Antigonus after a week&#x27;s captivity.

<text>Year 313 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Cursor and Brutus (or, less frequently, year 441 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 313 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Syria ====
*Antigonus sends Telesphorus to the Peloponnesus to free the cities.

==== Egypt ====
* Ptolemy, whose Egyptian kingdom includes Cyprus, puts down a revolt there. 
* A revolt in Cyrene is also crushed.

==== Asia Minor ====
* Prepelaus arrives in Caria and starts making plans with Asander. They decide on a surprise attack on Ptolemy, the commander of Antigonus&#x27; forces in western Asia Minor. Eupolemus, one of Prepelaus&#x27; lieutenants, is sent with 8,000 infantry and 200 cavalry. However, some deserters from Eupolemus&#x27; strike force betray their plans to Ptolemy who quickly gathers 8,300 infantry and 600 cavalry from their winter quarters and marches against Eupolemus. In the middle of the night Ptolemy launches a surprise attack on Eupolemus&#x27; camp capturing the entire force with ease.
* Antigonus, after finding a pass across the Taurus Mountains that was still open, marches his main army into Asia Minor and goes into winter quarters in Celaenae in Phrygia. Meanwhile, Antigonus&#x27; admiral Medius is ordered to sail the new Antigonid fleet from Phoenicia into the Aegean. On route he captures one of Cassander&#x27;s fleets (the one that had escorted Prepelaus to Asia Minor).
* Asander agrees to send all his soldiers to Antigonus to help keep Greek cities autonomous 
* Asander sends emissaries to Ptolemy and Seleucus asking for help

====Thrace====
*In the spring of 313 a revolt against Lysimachus is under way in the Greek cities of the northwestern Black Sea coast. Callatis, Istria and Odessus rebel. The latter two are quickly taken by Lysimachus, but Callatis holds out. Antigonus sends a fleet and an army under a general named Pausanias to aid the city, he also persuades the Thracian king Seuthes to rebel. Lysimachus leaves part of his army to continue the siege, while he himself marches against Pausanias. He fights his way past Seuthes through the Haemus Mountains and captures Pausanias&#x27; force, enrolling them in his army. Pausanias is killed in battle, but most of his officers are ransomed back to Antigonus. 

==== Greece ====
* Becoming tired of Macedonian rule, the people of Epirus recall their former king Aeacides (who until then had been campaigning with his old ally Polyperchon in the Peloponnese). Cassander immediately sends an army against him under his brother Philip, who is diverted from invading Aetolia. 
* At the autumn meeting of the Aetolian League, Aristodemus of Miletus, Antigonus&#x27; top diplomat, is able to persuade the Aetolians to support Antigonus. 
* Aristodemus and his mercenary army (recruited the year prior) cross over to the Peloponnese and fight Alexander, the son of Polyperchon, at Cyllene, and liberate Patrae and Aegium from Cassander&#x27;s garrisons. Aristodemus then returns to Aetolia, leaving a sizeable force in the Pelopponese who help the city of Dyme eject its garrison, despite a failed intervention by Alexander. 
* Philip marches into Acarnania to prevent Aeacides from linking up with the Aetolians. Philip defeats Aeacides in battle, killing many Epirotes and capturing 50 leading supporters of Aeacides, sending them as prisoners to Macedon. Aeacides, with the remnant of his forces, joins the Aetolians. Philip catches up to Aeacides and the Aetolians at Oeniadae and defeats them in battle. Aeacides, who was wounded in the Battle of Oeniadae, dies a few days later. The remaining Aetolian army takes refuge in the surrounding mountains.
* Cassander, hearing of Aristodemus&#x27; success with the Aetolians, marches south in force, persuades the Acarnanians to ally with him, and campaigns successfully along the Adriatic coast; capturing Apollonia and defeating the Illyrian king Glaucius. At the end of the year Cassander returns to Macedon.
* With his western border thus strengthened, Cassander sends Prepelaus, one of his top generals, with an army to Asia Minor to aid his ally Asander.
* Cassander orders Dionysius (the commander of his garrison in Athens) and Demetrius of Phalerum (the tyrant of Athens) to send a fleet of 20 warships to try and recapture Lemnos. An Athenian strategos named Aristoteles is sent, ravaging the island in conjunction with Seleucus (who was sent into the Aegean by Ptolemy). After Seleucus sails away, Aristoteles is attacked by the Antigonid fleet, most of his ships being captured.

==== Italy ====
* The Samnites take Fregellae in Latium, the Roman dictator Gaius Poetelius Libo Visolus marches his army from Rome and moves to retake it, but the Samnites leave at night; Visolus places a garrison in the city. 
* The consul Gaius Junius Bubulcus Brutus is credited with the capture of Nola, Atina, and Calatia by some sources.
:* The Romans capture Nola by setting fire to the buildings near the city walls and storming the city after the walls collapse.
* The Romans establish colonies at the Volscian island of Pontiae, the Volscian town of Interamna Sucasina and at Suessa Aurunca.

==== Sicily ====
* Deinocrates, the leader of the Syracusan exiles, sends envoys to the Carthaginians to ask them for help against Agathocles, the tyrant of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, fearing for their own possessions in Sicily, send a large force to the island.
* The exiles send Nymphodorus (a friend of Deinocrates) with some soldiers to take Centoripini (some of whose elite had promised to assist the exiles in taking the city). Nymphodorus is killed in the failed attempt to capture the city. Agathocles executes everyone he suspects of sedition in the city.

<text>Year 311 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Brutus and [[Quintus Aemilius Barbula|Barbula]] (or, less frequently, year 443 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 311 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Babylonia/Media/Susiana ====
* Upon entering Mesopotamia Seleucus manages to persuade some of the Macedonian veterans settled at Carrhae to join his cause. He then marches on to his old satrapy (province) of Babylonia gathering additional force along the way.
* Seleucus manages to persuade Polyarchus, the Antigonid commander of one of the local districts, to join his cause. Polyarchus joins Seleucus with 1,000 soldiers.
* The remaining Antigonid loyalists in Babylonia retreat to the citadel of Babylon. They also put Seleucus&#x27; remaining friends in Babylon there (under a strong guard). Seleucus besieges the citadel and manages to take it by storm.
* Nicanor, Antigonus&#x27; commander of the Upper Satrapies, marches against Seleucus from Media (where he was stationed) with 10,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry. Seleucus hides his much smaller army (3,000 infantry and 400 cavalry) along Nicanor&#x27;s line of march and launches a night attack on his camp, catching his opponent by surprise; Nicanor flees the ensuing battle while his army quickly surrenders.
* Seleucus marches to eastern Susiana and negotiates a treaty with the Cossaei (a warlike tribe) in the mountains between Susiana and Media.
* Seleucus reestablishes himself as satrap of Babylonia and asserts control over Media and Susiana (Elam).

==== Asia Minor/Syria/Palestina ====
* Ptolemy tries to occupy Syria; he himself campaigns in Coele Syria (southern Syria) while he sends Killes, one of his generals, into northern Syria to finish off the remnants of Demetrius Poliorcetes&#x27; army. Demetrius defeats Killes at Myus and Antigonus enters Syria in force. So, after only a few months, Ptolemy evacuates his forces from Syria.
* In view of the threat by Seleucus to his control of the East, Antigonus decides to make peace with all of his adversaries, except Seleucus, who now holds Babylon. All of the diadochi confirm the existing boundaries and the freedom of the Greek cities. Ptolemy and Lysimachus are confirmed as satraps of Egypt and Thrace, respectively, and Antigonus and Cassander are confirmed as commanders of the army in Asia and Europe. Antigonus, no longer regent but now titled the strategos (officer in charge) of the whole of Asia, rules in Syria from the Hellespont to the Euphrates, including Asia Minor.
* It is agreed by all parties that the young king Alexander IV of Macedon, son of Alexander the Great, will become king of the whole empire when he comes of age in six years&#x27; time.
* The peace agreement between the diadochi is soon violated. On the pretext that garrisons have been placed in some of the free Greek cities by Antigonus. Ptolemy and Cassander renew hostilities against him.
* Antigonus sends one of his generals, Athenaeus, with 4,000 light infantry and 600 cavalry to make a raid on Petra, the capital city of the Nabateans, to carry off hostages and possessions. The raid is initially successful, but a surprise attack by the Nabateans destroys Athenaeus&#x27; raiding force, only 50 horsemen escaping.
* Through clever diplomacy Antigonus is able to lull the Nabateans into a false sense of security. Demetrius, with a force of 4,000 light infantry and 4,000 cavalry, is sent to make another raid on Petra. The Nabateans, reacting quickly, are able to foil the attack. Demetrius negotiates terms with the Nabateans and returns to his father with hostages and gifts (including 700 camels)

====Greece====
* During the winter of 312/11 Antigonus&#x27; nephew Telesphorus, who had been subordinated to Antigonus&#x27; other nephew Ptolemy in 312, decides to rebel, considering his subordination to be insulting. Ptolemy is able to keep the situation under control and persuades Telesphorus to return to the fold.
* Cassander opens up negotiations with Ptolemy.

====Italy====
* The Second Samnite War continues, the Roman consuls Gaius Junius Bubulcus Brutus and Quintus Aemilius Barbula divide their command.
::* Barbula campaigns against the Etruscans.
::* Brutus campaigns against the Samnites.
* The Samnites take the Roman garrison of Cluviae and scourge their prisoners. Junius liberates the city and then moves on Bovianum and sacks it. The Samnites try to ambush the Romans, but the Romans are able to overcome their assailants.
* The Etruscans are besieging Sutrium, an ally which the Romans see as their key to Etruria. Barbula marches to their aid, and a battle is fought; the Romans start to gain the upper hand, but darkness stops the battle. Barbula&#x27;s campaign ends indecisive.

==== Sicily ====
* The Carthaginian general Hamilcar crosses the Mediterranean with an army and wins the Battle of Himera against Agathocles, the tyrant of Syracuse.
* Hamilcar then proceeds with laying siege to Syracuse, where Agathocles had retreated.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===

====Mesopotamia/Babylonia====
* Antigonus marches his main army east to confront Seleucus. The Antigonid and Seleucid armies meet somewhere in southern Mesopotamia or northern Babylonia and a battle is fought to a draw. The next morning Seleucus launches a surprise attack on Antigonus&#x27; camp and wins a simple victory. After his defeat Antigonus gives up on his ambitions to reconquer the eastern provinces.
* Seleucus marches east and continues his conquest of the eastern provinces of the Macedonian Empire; the so called Upper Satrapies.

==== Greece ====
* Ptolemy crosses from Asia Minor into Greece, where he takes possession of Corinth, Sicyon and Megara.
* Ptolemy makes peace with Cassander
* Cleopatra of Macedon is assassinated by the order of Antigonus

==== Italy ====
* The Second Samnite War escalates when the tribes of the central Apennines, the Umbrians, Picentini, and Marsians join the war against Rome. However, Rome is able to control the uprising.
* The Etruscans sue for peace with Rome, which is granted by the Romans on severe terms.

==== North Africa ====
* The Carthaginians send out an army to coerce the Zuphones, a Numidian tribe, back into their alliance with Carthage; they are successful in their endeavour.
* Agathocles leaves his main army under the command of his son Archagathus encamped before Tunis while he, with a strikeforce of 8,000 infantry, 800 cavalry and 50 chariots, marches after the Carthaginian army.
* The Carthaginians send the Numidians to harass Agathocles&#x27; strike force, the skirmishing draws in more and more troops until it eventually leeds to a battle which is won by Agathocles.
* While Agathocles was in pursuit of the defeated Carthaginian army, the Numidians (who had retreated from the battle earlier on) attack his camp and ride off with a part of his army&#x27;s booty. Agathocles returns to his camp, divides what is left of the booty (so no one can complain) and sets up a victory trophy.
*Agathocles sends Orthon the Syracusan to Cyrene to request aid in subduing Carthage from Ophellas (Ptolemy&#x27;s governor of Cyrenaica).
* Ophellas recruits an army of 10,000 infantry, 600 cavalry and 100 chariots for his campaign in support of Agathocles.
* After a arduous march from Cyrenaica to Carthaginian Libya Ophellas&#x27; forces link up with Agathocles&#x27; army.
* Agathocles lures Ophellas into a false sense of security and launches a surprise attack on his camp. Ophellas is killed in the fighting and Agathocles takes over Ophellas&#x27; army, adding its numbers to his own.
* While the Carthaginian army is away from the city, Bomilcar tries to make himself tyrant of Carthage. He fails and is executed.

== Births ==
* Hiero II, Greek Sicilian tyrant and king of Syracuse (approximate date)
* Zhao Sheng, Chinese chancellor of the Zhao State (approximate date)

== Deaths ==
* Cleopatra of Macedon, sister of Alexander the Great and daughter of King Philip II of Macedon and Olympias (b. c. 356 BC)
* Ophellas, ruler of Cyrenaica (governor for Ptolemy).

<text>Year 309 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Dictatorship of Cursor (or, less frequently, year 445 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 309 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
=== By place ===

==== Asia Minor ====
* Ptolemy I Soter personally commands a fleet that takes the coastal regions of Lycia and Caria from Antigonus I Monophthalmus, capturing the cities of Phaselis, Xanthos, Kaunos, Iasos and Myndus.

====Thrace====
*Lysimachus, the Macedonian ruler of Thrace and one of diadochi, founds the city of Lysimachia on the north-western extremity of the Thracian Chersonese (the modern Gallipoli peninsula) to serve as his capital.

==== Greece ====
* Cassander, who has held Roxana, widow of Alexander the Great, in prison for a number of years, has her put to death along with her young son Alexander, the nominal King Alexander IV of Macedon.
* Antigonus attempts to renew his alliance with the Macedonian general and former regent Polyperchon, who still controls part of the Peloponnesus. He sends Heracles, the illegitimate son of Alexander the Great, to Polyperchon to be treated as a pretender to the throne of Macedonia.
* Polyperchon manages to form an army consisting of 20,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry and challenges Cassander&#x27;s army. Instead of fighting, Cassander starts negotiations with Polyperchon. By offering to make him a general of his own army and placing him as governor of Peloponnesus, he convinces Polyperchon to change allegiance to him instead of Heracles. As a result, Polyperchon murders Heracles and his mother Barsine.
* Areus I succeeds his grandfather Cleomenes II as king of Sparta.
* A census is carried out in Athens. 21,000 citizens, 10,000 foreign residents and 400,000 others – women, children and slaves – are living in the city.
* Ptolemy arrives at Kos and sends for Ptolemaeus (the nephew of Antigonus – who has revolted against Antigonus) to join him to discuss strategy. After finding out Ptolemaeus plans to take over his army and fleet, Ptolemy forces him to commit suicide.

==== Carthage ====
* Since 480 BC, an aristocratic Council of Elders has effectively ruled Carthage. The titular king of Carthage, Bomilcar, attempts a coup to restore the monarchy to full power. His attempt fails, which leads to Carthage becoming, in name as well as in fact, a republic.
* Leaving his brother Antander to continue the defence of Syracuse, Agathocles lands in North Africa with the aim of distracting the Carthaginians from their siege of Syracuse. Agathocles concludes a treaty with Ophellas, ruler of Cyrenaica. He then takes advantage of the civil unrest in Carthage and nearly succeeds in conquering the city.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Samnites again rise against Rome. Lucius Papirius Cursor is appointed dictator for the second time and wins a great victory at Longula over the Samnites.

==== China ====
* Soon after the State of Qin has conquered the State of Shu (in modern-day Sichuan province), they employ the Shu engineer Bi Ling to create the Guanxian irrigation system, which will eventually provide for over five million people in an area of 40 to , still in use today.

== Births ==
* Ptolemy II Philadelphus, King of Egypt (d. 246 BC)

== Deaths ==
* King Alexander IV of Macedon (b. 323 BC)
* Cleomenes II, Agiad King of Sparta
* Heracles, illegitimate son of Alexander the Great and claimant to the throne of Macedon (b. 327 BC)
* Ptolemy (general) general of Antigonus I Monophthalmus
* Roxana, wife of Alexander the Great, and mother of Alexander IV of Macedon
* Zhang Yi, strategist of the Chinese state of Qin

<text>Year 306 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Tremulus and Arvina (or, less frequently, year 448 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;).

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Cyprus ====
* Demetrius Poliorcetes lands on Cyprus and besieges Menelaus, brother of Egypt&#x27;s ruler, Ptolemy I Soter, at Salamis. Ptolemy Soter, coming to his brother&#x27;s aid, is decisively defeated in the Battle of Salamis. The battle completely destroys the naval power of Egypt and results in the capture of Cyprus by Demetrius. This gives Demetrius&#x27; father, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, control of the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean.

==== Syria ====
* Antigonus I Monophthalmus proclaims himself king of Asia Minor and northern Syria thus commencing the Antigonid dynasty. He appoints his son Demetrius king and co-regent.

==== Egypt ====
* Antigonus Monophthalmus tries to follow up his victory in Cyprus by invading Egypt with a large army and a formidable fleet, but Ptolemy Soter successfully holds the frontier against him. However, the year&#x27;s events mean that Ptolemy no longer engages in overseas expeditions against Antigonus.

==== Thrace ====
* A four-drachma coin, picturing Alexander the Great, is issued by Lysimachos from this time until 281 BC. At least one of them is now preserved at the British Museum in London.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Italy ====
* The Samnites take Sora and Calatia, cities allied to the Romans, and enslave their inhabitants.
* The Romans invade Iapygia and begin a siege of Silvium (garrisoned by the Samnites). Eventually, they take the city by storm, taking 5,000 prisoners. After the Siege of Silvium they invade Samnium itself, pillaging the countryside for five months.

==== Sicily ====
* Agathocles tries to negotiate a settlement with Deinocrates, the leader of the exiles, but the latter refuses, forcing Agathocles to continue the war for dominance over eastern Sicily.
* A peace agreement is reached between Syracuse and Carthage. The peace restricts Carthaginian power in Sicily to the area west of the Halycus (Platani) River. This agreement allows the tyrant of Syracuse, Agathocles, to strengthen his rule over the Greek cities in the east of Sicily.

== Births ==
== Deaths ==
* Philip, youngest son of Antigonus Monophthalmus.
* Dionysius of Heraclea, tyrant of Heraclea Pontica.

<text>Year 304 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Sophus and Saverrio (or, less frequently, year 450 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 304 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* Demetrius shows ingenuity in devising a new siege engine: a wheeled siege tower named Helepolis (or &quot;Taker of Cities&quot;), which stands 40 meters tall and 20 meters wide and weighs 180 tons. 
* The Siege of Rhodes ends after a year. 
*Demetrius Poliorcetes and the Rhodians come to a truce, with the agreement that the city should be autonomous, should keep its own revenue and that the Rhodians should be allies of Antigonus unless he is at war with Ptolemy. 
* Antigonus then concludes a peace treaty and an alliance with the island state, guaranteeing it autonomy and neutrality in his conflicts with Ptolemy. 
* Cassander invades Attica and besieges Athens. He captures the island of Salamis off the coast of Athens.
*Demetrius Poliorcetes invades mainland Greece for Asia-Minor, drives Cassander out of central Greece and liberates Athens. In return, the Athenians bestow on him a new religious honour, synnaos (meaning &quot;having the same temple&quot;) of the temple of the goddess Athena.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The second Samnite war formally ends with a peace agreement in which the Samnites obtain peace on terms that are severe but not as crushing as those agreed by the Romans with the Etruscans four years earlier. Under the peace, Rome gains no territory, but the Samnites renounce their hegemony over Campania. Rome is also successful in ending the revolts amongst the tribes surrounding Roman territory.

==== Sicily ====
* The tyrant Agathocles takes on the title of King of Sicily. He extends his influence into southern Italy and the Adriatic.

==== India ====
* The Mauryan emperor Chandragupta defeats Seleucus I Nicator as he tries to invade India.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Ashoka, Indian emperor and ruler of the Maurya Empire in present-day Eastern India 268–232 BC (d. 232 BC)
* Erasistratus, Greek anatomist and physician (approximate date)

== Deaths ==

== In popular culture ==
*450 &quot;Ab urbe condita&quot; is the starting year for the &quot;&quot; grand strategy computer game.

* Following their agreement to work together to defeat Antigonus, Seleucus invades Asia Minor from Babylonia, while Ptolemy attacks Syria and Lysimachus moves into the western part of Asia Minor.
* Docimus, the regent of Phrygia, and Phoenix, the strategos of Lycia, desert Antigonus.
* The Macedonian general, Philetaerus, moves his allegiance from Antigonus to Antigonus&#x27; rival, Lysimachus. In return, Lysimachus makes Philetaerus guardian of the fortress of Pergamum with its treasure of some 9,000 talents.

==== Greece ====
* Antigonus&#x27; son Demetrius Poliorcetes attacks Cassander&#x27;s forces in Thessaly. Cassander loses his possessions south of Thessaly to Demetrius.

Ambassadors from all the Hellenic states (with the exception of Sparta, Messenia and Thessaly) meet at Corinth to elect Antigonus and Demetrius protectors of the new league.
* As Antigonus is finding his enemies closing in on him, a truce is made and the gains by Demetrius have to be abandoned. Demetrius reaches Ephesus to support his father.
* Pyrrhus is dethroned as King of Epirus by an uprising and joins Demetrius while in exile.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<text>John I (15 – 19 November 1316), called the Posthumous (, ), was the King of France and Navarre, as the posthumous son and successor of Louis X, for the four days he lived in 1316. He is the youngest person to be king of France, the only one to have been king from birth, and the only one to hold the title for his entire life. His reign is the shortest of any undisputed French king. Although considered as a king today, his status was not recognized until chroniclers and historians in later centuries began numbering John II, thereby acknowledging John I&#x27;s brief reign.

John reigned for four days under the regency of his uncle, Philip V of France, until his death on 19 November 1316. His death ended the three centuries of father-to-son succession to the French throne. The infant king was buried in the Basilica of Saint-Denis. He was succeeded by his uncle, Philip, whose contested legitimacy led to the re-affirmation of the Salic law, which excluded women from the line of succession to the French throne.

==Consequences==

The child mortality rate was very high in medieval Europe and John may have died from any number of causes, but rumours of poisoning spread immediately after his death (including one which said that he had been murdered with a pin by his aunt), as many people benefited from it, and as John&#x27;s father had also died in strange circumstances. The cause of his death is still not known today.

The premature death of John brought the first issue of succession of the Capetian dynasty. When Louis X, his father, died without a son to succeed him, it was the first time since Hugh Capet that the succession from father to son of the kings of France was interrupted. It was then decided to wait until his pregnant widow, Clementia of Hungary, delivered the child. The king&#x27;s brother, Philip the Tall, was in charge of the regency of the kingdom against his uncle Charles of Valois. The birth of a male child was expected to give France its king. The problem of succession returned when John died four days after birth. Philip ascended the throne at the expense of John&#x27;s four-year-old half-sister, Joan, daughter of Louis X and Margaret of Burgundy.

==Supposed survival==
Various legends circulated about this royal child. First, it was claimed that his uncle, Philip the Tall, had him poisoned. Then, a strange story a few decades later started the rumor that the little King John was not dead. During the captivity of John the Good (13561360), a man named Giannino Baglioni claimed to be John I and thus the heir to the throne. He tried to assert his rights, but was captured in Provence and died in captivity in 1363.

In &quot;The Man Who Believed He Was King of France&quot;, Tommaso di Carpegna Falconieri suggests that Cola di Rienzo manufactured false evidence that Baglioni was John the Posthumous in order to strengthen his own power in Rome by placing Baglioni on the French throne. Shortly after they met in 1354, di Rienzo was assassinated, and Baglioni waited two years to report his claims. He went to the Hungarian court where Louis I of Hungary, nephew of Clementia of Hungary, allegedly recognized him as the son of Louis and Clementia. In 1360, Baglioni went to Avignon, but Pope Innocent VI refused to receive him. After several attempts to gain recognition, he was arrested and imprisoned in Naples, where he died in 1363.

Maurice Druon&#x27;s historical novel series &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; dramatises this theory and develops it as a major plotline throughout the series. In &quot;La Loi des mâles&quot; (1957), the infant John is temporarily switched with the child of Guccio Baglioni and Marie de Cressay as a decoy by Hugues de Bouville, former chamberlain to Philip IV and protector of the child, and his wife. This child, mistaken for John, is subsequently poisoned by Mahaut, Countess of Artois, in order to place John&#x27;s uncle (and Mahaut&#x27;s son-in-law), Philippe, Count of Poitiers, on the throne. Marie is coerced into secretly raising John as her own son, named Giannino Baglioni. An adult Giannino was portrayed by Jean-Gérard Sandoz in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by Lorand Stoica in the 2005 adaptation.

<text>Year 294 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Megellus and Regulus (or, less frequently, year 460 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 294 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* Archidamus IV, king of Sparta, son of Eudamidas I and grandson of Archidamus III, is defeated by Demetrius Poliorcetes of Macedonia in a battle at Mantinea. Sparta is saved only because Demetrius is called away by the threatening activities of his rivals Lysimachus and Ptolemy.
* Alexander V of Macedon is ousted by his brother, Antipater II. Therefore Alexander V turns to Demetrius Poliorcetes for help in recovering his throne. However, Demetrius Poliorcetes establishes himself on the throne of Macedonia and then murders Alexander V. Antipater II loses the throne of Macedonia but is able to survive.
* Pyrrhus of Epirus exploits the dynastic quarrel in Macedonia involving Alexander V of Macedon, his brother, Antipater II and Demetrius Poliorcetes to take over the frontier areas of Parauaea and Tymphaea, along with Acarnania, Ampholochia, and Ambracia.
* Lysimachus concludes a peace with Demetrius Poliorcetes whereby Demetrius Poliorcetes is recognized as ruler of Macedonia.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Third Samnite War:
:* On a road connecting Roman and Samnite territory, the Samnites attack and nearly capture the camp of consul Marcus Atilius Regulus, who retreats to Sora and is joined by consul Lucius Postumius Megellus. The combining of consular armies prompts the Samnite army to withdraw to Samnium.
:* Postumius storms the Samnite city of Milionia, and several other towns, including Fertrum, are abandoned by their inhabitants and occupied by Postumius.
:* Without senatorial permission, Postumius marches to Etruria, wins an engagement against the Volsinii and storms the town of Rusellae. The cities of Volsinii, Perusia, and Arretium sue for peace with Rome and obtain truces for forty years. 
:* Atilius marches to Apulia to relieve Luceria from a Samnite siege but is intercepted by the Samnites near the city, where he is defeated by a smaller army. He then wins an engagement against the Volcentes.
:* After an unsuccessful attempt to capture the Roman colony of Interamna, a Samnite army raids the surrounding countryside only to be attacked by Atilius, who recovers the booty.
:* Against precedent, Postumius has the Comitia Centuriata vote him a triumph despite senatorial opposition.

==== Egypt ====
* Ptolemy gains control over Cyprus and the Phoenician coastal towns of Tyre and Sidon.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Stratonice, daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes and wife of Seleucus marries her stepson Antiochus. Seleucus has reportedly instigated the marriage after discovering that his son by his late wife Apama was in danger of dying of lovesickness as he has fallen in love with his beautiful stepmother.

====China====
* General Bai Qi of the State of Qin launches a surprise attack on the State of Han and captures the city of Xincheng.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Third Samnite War:
:* Lucius Postumius Megellus, a consul of the previous year, avoids prosecution after he is appointed legate to consul Spurius Carvilius Maximus.
:* The consul Carvilius captures the city of Amiternum, and consul Lucius Papirius Cursor captures the city of Duronia.
:* On the same day that Carvilius storms the major Samnite city of Cominium, Papirius, aided by former consuls Lucius Volumnius Flamma Violens and Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus, defeats the &#x27;Linen Legion&#x27; in the Battle of Aquilonia and captures the city of Aquilonia during the Samnite retreat. The Samnites suffer 20,340 killed and 3870 captured in the Battle of Aquilonia and 4880 killed and 11,400 captured in the Siege of Cominium.
:* Carvilius captures the towns of Velia, Palumbinum, and, after an initial defeat, Herculaneum, and after fighting the Samnites in the field, Papirius besieges and captures the city of Saepinum.
:* Due to renewed hostility among some of the Etruscans, who are joined by the Falisci, Carvilius marches to Etruria, storms the town of Troilum and captures five forts. The Falisci then sue for peace and receive a one-year truce.
* The worship of Aesculapius is introduced from Epidaurus to Rome in the hope of ending a plague.

==== China ====
* The State of Qin, led by commander Bai Qi, wins a decisive victory over the States of Wei and Han in the Battle of Yique. He then captures territories in Han before invading and capturing further territories in Wei.

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* Lysimachus tries to extend his influence beyond the Danube River, but he is defeated and taken prisoner by the Getae (Dacian) king Dromichaetes (Dromihete). Eventually, Lysimachus is set free and a peace is agreed between the Getae and Lysimachus. This peace agreement is strengthened further by the marriage of Dromichaetes with Lysimachus&#x27; daughter.
* While Demetrius Poliorcetes is campaigning in Boeotia, he receives news that Lysimachus, the ruler of Thrace, has been taken prisoner by Dromichaetes. Hoping to seize Lysimachus&#x27;s territories in Thrace, Demetrius, delegates command of his forces in Boeotia to his son, Antigonus and immediately marches north. However, while he is away, the Boeotians rise in rebellion, but are defeated by Antigonus, who bottles them up in the city of Thebes and puts them under siege.
* Antiochus I Soter annointed as king of the Seleucid Syria

==== Roman Republic ====
* Third Samnite War:
:* The Samnites reappoint Gavius Pontius, the victor of the Battle of Caudine Forks, as general, and in Campania he defeats the consul Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges. However, Fabius is joined by his father, Q. Fabius Maximus Rullianus, as legate and de facto general, and they defeat Pontius in battle and capture the general and his camp. They then capture several towns of the Pentri, a prominent tribe of the Samnites.
:* The Falisci renew their efforts against Rome. However, the consul Decimus Junius Brutus Scaeva, assisted by former consul Spurius Carvilius Maximus, defeats them in an engagement and ravages their territory and those of the Etruscans. The Falisci and Etruscans again sue for peace, and this ends the Etruscan theatre of the Third Samnite War.

==== China ====
* General Bai Qi of the State of Qin defeats the State of Wei in a major battle and captures cities in Wei. Wei cedes control of 61 towns and cities.

<doc id="77156" wikidata="Q983805" url="?curid=77156" title="Lake Oswego, Oregon">
<text>Lake Oswego ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Oregon, primarily in Clackamas County, with small portions extending into neighboring Multnomah and Washington counties. Population in 2020 was 40,731, an 11.2% increase since 2010, making it the 11th most populous city in Oregon. Located about south of Portland and surrounding the Oswego Lake, the town was founded in 1847 and incorporated as Oswego in 1910. The city was the hub of Oregon&#x27;s brief iron industry in the late 19th century, and is today a suburb of Portland.

==History==

===Early history===
The Clackamas people once occupied the land that later became Lake Oswego, but diseases transmitted by European explorers and traders killed most of the natives. Before the influx of non-native people via the Oregon Trail, the area between the Willamette River and Tualatin River had a scattering of early pioneer homesteads and farms.

===19th century===

As settlers arrived, encouraged by the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850 and the subsequent Homestead Act, they found the land underoccupied.

Albert Alonzo Durham founded the town of Oswego in 1847, naming it after Oswego, New York. He built a sawmill on Sucker Creek (now Oswego Creek), the town&#x27;s first industry.

In 1855, the federal government forcibly relocated the remaining Clackamas people to the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation in nearby Yamhill County.

During this early period in Oregon history, most trade proceeded from Portland to Oregon City via the Willamette River, and up the Tualatin River valley through Tualatin, Scholls, and Hillsboro. The thick woods and rain-muddied roads were major obstacles to traveling by land. The vestiges of river landings, ferry stops, and covered bridges of this period can still be seen along this area. A landing in the city&#x27;s present-day George Rogers Park is thought to have been developed by Durham around 1850 for lumber transport; another landing was near the Tryon Creek outlet into the Willamette.

In 1865, prompted by the earlier discovery of iron ore in the Tualatin Valley, the Oregon Iron Company was incorporated. Within two years, the first blast furnace on the West Coast was built, patterned after the arched furnaces common in northwestern Connecticut, and the company set out to make Oswego into the &quot;Pittsburgh of the West&quot;. In 1878, the company was sold off to out-of-state owners and renamed the Oswego Iron Company, and in 1882, Portland financiers Simeon Gannett Reed and Henry Villard purchased the business and renamed it the Oregon Iron and Steel Company.

The railroad arrived in Oswego in 1886, in the form of the Portland and Willamette Valley Railway. A line provided Oswego with a direct link to Portland. Prior to this, access to the town was limited to primitive roads and riverboats. The railroad&#x27;s arrival was a mixed blessing; locally, it promoted residential development along its path, which enabled Oswego to grow beyond its industrial roots, but nationally, the continued expansion of the freight railroad system gave easy local access to cheaper and higher quality iron from the Great Lakes region. This ultimately led to the local industry&#x27;s demise.

By 1890, the industry produced 12,305 tons of pig iron, and at its peak provided employment to around 300 men. The success of this industry greatly stimulated the development of Oswego, which by this time had four general stores, a bank, two barber shops, two hotels, three churches, nine saloons, a drugstore, and even an opera house.

The iron industry was a vital part of a strategy designed by a few Portland financiers who strove to control all related entrepreneurial ventures in the late 19th century. Control of shipping and railroads was held under the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, later to become the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. This local monopoly responded to the area&#x27;s increasing demand for iron and steel, and grew to play a key role in economic history throughout the area.

===20th and 21st centuries===
The Oregon Iron and Steel Company adapted to the new century by undertaking programs in land development, selling large tracts of the of land it owned, and power, building a plant on Oswego Creek starting in 1905, and erecting power poles in subsequent years to supply power to Oswego citizens. With the water needs of the smelters tailing off, the recreational potential of the lake and town was freed to develop rapidly.

In 1910, the town of Oswego was incorporated. The Southern Pacific Railroad, which had acquired the P&amp;WVR line at the end of the 19th century, widened it from narrow to standard gauge and in 1914 electrified it, providing rapid, clean, and quiet service between Oswego and Portland. The service was known as the Red Electric.

Passenger traffic hit its peak in 1920 with 64 trains to and from Portland daily. Within nine years of the peak, passenger service ended, and the line was used for intermittent freight service to Portland&#x27;s south waterfront until its abandonment in 1984. The line was preserved, however, and the Willamette Shore Trolley provides tourist rides on the line today.

One of the land developers benefiting from sales by OI&amp;S was Paul Murphy, whose Oswego Lake Country Club helped promote the new city as a place to &quot;live where you play.&quot; Murphy was instrumental in developing the first water system to supply the western reaches of the city, and also played a key role in encouraging the design of fine homes in the 1930s and 1940s that ultimately established Oswego as an attractive place to live. In the 1940s and 1950s, continued development helped spread Oswego&#x27;s residential areas.

Mass transit service after the end of electric interurban service was provided by Oregon Motor Stages, but that company suspended all operations following a drivers&#x27; strike in 1954. In 1955, a newly formed private company, Intercity Buses, Inc., began operating bus service connecting Oswego with downtown Portland and Oregon City. This service was taken over by TriMet in 1970.

In 1960, Oswego was renamed &quot;Lake Oswego&quot; when it annexed part of neighboring Lake Grove. The city has some nicknames including &quot;Lake No-Negro&quot;, &quot;Lake Big Ego&quot;, &quot;Fake Oswego&quot; and &quot;Fake Lost Ego&quot;. Additionally, it was spoken of as Nimbyville during a planning-related seminar on 2008 by Dennis Egner. A 2012 article in the &quot;Daily Journal of Commerce&quot; identified Egner as a long-range planning director for the city of Lake Oswego. According to historian James W. Loewen, locals often call it &quot;Lake No Negro&quot; in reference to its recognition status as an &quot;elite white suburb&quot;.

In August 2020, Lake Oswego received significant media attention when its resident received an anonymous letter from neighbors asking them to take down their &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; sign from the window, complaining that it lowers property values, which prompted Mayor Studebaker to issue a response to this matter. A documentary titled &quot;Lake No Negro&quot; about Lake Oswego&#x27;s racially exclusive past was produced by a Lakeridge High School student in 2020.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are covered by water. That area does not include more than of unincorporated land within the urban services boundary as defined by Clackamas County. Oswego Lake is a lake, originally named &quot;Waluga&quot; (wild swan) by Clackamas Indians, which has been expanded is and currently managed by the Lake Oswego Corporation. The lake supports watercraft, and a dock floats at the lake&#x27;s east end, where boaters can disembark and walk to the nearby businesses. The main canal from the Tualatin River was dug in 1872.

Every three years, the water level in the lake is lowered several feet by opening the gates on the dam and allowing water to flow into Oswego Creek and on to the Willamette River, enabling lakefront property owners to conduct repairs on docks and boathouses. In 2010, the lake was lowered about to allow for construction of a new sewer line, the lowest lake level since 1962, when the original sewer line was installed.

Oswego Lake has been a subject of controversy over whether it is a private lake or a public navigable water. A lawsuit against the city charges that they are preventing people from using a public stairway in a public park to swim in a public lake. The City of Lake Oswego does not allow public access. Two recreational users of the lake who were barred from using the lake filed a lawsuit in 2012. On August 1, 2019, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled that a 2012 Lake Oswego ordinance will need to be reviewed. The Supreme Court recognized public right to enter the body of water from public land and that the City of Lake Oswego cannot interfere with this right.

In April 2024, a Clackamas County Circuit judge affirmed an advisory jury&#x27;s ruling that City of Lake Oswego had overstepped its boundary by preventing access to the lake from Millennium Park Plaza.

==Public schools==
The Lake Oswego School District includes most of the city boundaries, and serves roughly 7,000 students, with a ratio of 23 students per instructor. The two high schools in the district are Lake Oswego High School and Lakeridge High School. The six elementary schools and two junior high schools serve students in grades 1 through 8. The junior high schools are Lakeridge Junior High and Lake Oswego Junior High. Lakeridge Junior High was known as Waluga Junior High until 2012 when it was merged with Bryant Elementary.

A portion of Lake Oswego in Multnomah County is in Portland Public Schools.

==Cultural and recreational facilities==
The city maintains of parks and open spaces including George Rogers Park, Millennium Plaza Park and Lake Oswego Golf Course.

Lake Oswego has one public library, part of the Library Information Network of Clackamas County. From 2002 to 2006, the library was rated among the top 10 libraries serving similar population sizes in the United States.

<text>Year 281 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of [[Lucius Aemilius Barbula|Barbula]] and [[Quintus Marcius Philippus (consul 281 BC)|Philippus]] (or, less frequently, year 473 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 281 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Asia Minor ====
* The Battle of Corupedium in Lydia is the last battle of the Diadochi, the rival successors to Alexander the Great. It is fought between the armies of Lysimachus, King of Thrace, Macedonia, Western Anatolia and Seleucus, ruler of Eastern Anatolia, Syria, Phoenicia, Judea, Babylonia and Iran. Seleucus kills Lysimachus during the battle.
* Following the Battle of Corupedium, Lysimachus&#x27; widow, Arsinoe, flees to Cassandrea, a city in northern Greece, where she marries her half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos. This proves to be a serious misjudgement, as Ptolemy Keraunus promptly kills two of her sons, though the third is able to escape. Arsinoe flees again, this time to Alexandria in Egypt.

==== Greece ====
* Seleucus takes over Thrace and then tries to seize Macedonia. However, he falls into a trap near Lysimachia, Thrace, set by Ptolemy Keraunos, one of the sons of Ptolemy I and Arsinoe II&#x27;s half brother, who murders Seleucus and takes Macedonia for himself.
* Cineas, a Thessalian serving as chief adviser to King Pyrrhus of Epirus, after visiting Rome attempts, without success, to dissuade Pyrrhus from invading southern Italy.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Seleucus is succeeded as ruler of the Seleucid empire by Antiochus, who was already king of the Syrian part of the empire. He is immediately beset by revolts in Syria (probably instigated by Ptolemy II of Egypt) and by independence movements in northern Anatolia.
* Although he has only a few bases in Greece, Antigonus II Gonatas lays claim to Macedonia. His claim is disputed by Antiochus I.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Zhuangxiang of Qin, Chinese king of the Qin State (d. 247 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Lysimachus, king of Thrace and Macedonia (b. c. 360 BC)
* Seleucus I Nicator, founder of the Seleucid Empire (b. c. 354 BC)

<text>Year 282 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.

== Events ==
=== By place ===
==== Asia Minor ====
* The city of Pergamum in Asia Minor ends its allegiance to Lysimachus. Its ruler, Philetaerus, transfers his allegiance, as well as the important fortress of Pergamon and his treasury, to Seleucus, who allows him a far larger measure of independence than he had hitherto enjoyed.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Battle of Populonia is fought between Rome and the Etruscans. The Romans are victorious and, as a result, the Etruscan threat to Rome is sharply diminished.
* The Magna Graecia city of Thurii appeals to Rome for help against the native Italian tribes. Though the Roman Senate hesitates, the plebeian Assembly decides to respond. Thurii is saved, but Tarentum, jealous of Rome&#x27;s interference, attacks and sinks some Roman ships entering its harbour. Roman envoys, sent to protest, are mistreated.
* Rome declares war on Tarentum. King Pyrrhus of Epirus declares his willingness to come to the aid of Tarentum. Tarentum also looks for support from the Samnites and other Italian tribes in southern Italy.

==== Egypt ====
* Arsinoe, daughter of Lysimachus, king of Thrace, marries Ptolemy II of Egypt as part of the alliance between Thrace and Egypt against Seleucus.

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Ptolemy I Soter, Macedonian military general who served under Alexander the Great and became ruler of Egypt (born c.367)

<text>Year 284 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.

The denomination 284 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Gallic tribe called the Senones, who have settled on the Adriatic coast north of Picenum, attack Arretium in Etruria. While attempting to relieve this allied city, the Romans under the command of Lucius Caecilius Metellus Denter suffer a costly defeat in the Battle of Arretium. Aroused by this disaster, a Roman army under Manius Curius Dentatus invades the Senones&#x27; territory, defeating them and driving them out of the Italian peninsula.

==== Asia Minor ====
* Ptolemy I&#x27;s eldest (legitimate) son, Ptolemy Keraunos, whose mother, Eurydice, the daughter of Antipater, had been repudiated by the new King Ptolemy II, flees Egypt to the court of Lysimachus, the king of Thrace, Macedon and Asia Minor.
* Lysimachus&#x27; wife, Arsinoe, being keen to gain the succession to the kingdom of Thrace for her sons in preference to Agathocles (the eldest son of Lysimachus), intrigues against him with the help of her brother Ptolemy Keraunos. They accuse him of conspiring with Seleucus to seize the throne, and Agathocles is put to death. This atrocious deed by Lysimachus and his family arouses great indignation. Many of the cities in Asia Minor revolt and some of his most trusted friends desert him.
* Agathocles&#x27; widow Lysandra flees with their children and with Alexander, Agathocles&#x27; brother, to the court of Seleucus, who at once invades Lysimachus&#x27; territory in Asia Minor.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Agathocles, son of King Lysimachus of Thrace
* Ardvates, governor and later ruler of Armenia who founds a dynasty that will rule until 211 BC
* Lucius Caecilius Metellus Denter, Roman consul and general (killed in the Battle of Arretium) (b. c. 320 BC)

=== By place ===
==== Egypt ====
* June 26 – Egypt&#x27;s Ptolemy I Soter abdicates. He is succeeded by his youngest son by his wife Berenice, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who has been co-regent for three years.
* A 110 metre tall lighthouse on the island of Pharos in Alexandria&#x27;s harbour is completed and serves as a landmark for ships in the eastern Mediterranean. Built by Sostratus of Cnidus for Ptolemy II of Egypt, it is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It is a technological triumph and is the archetype of all lighthouses since. A broad spiral ramp leads to the top, where a fire burns at night.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Demetrius Poliorcetes is deserted by his troops and surrenders to Seleucus at Cilicia, where Seleucus keeps him a prisoner.

==== China ====
* The success of Qi has frightened the other states. Under the leadership of Lord Mengchang, who has been exiled in Wei, Qin, Zhao, Han and Yan form an alliance. Yan had normally been a relatively weak ally of Qi and Qi feared little from this quarter. Yan&#x27;s onslaught under general Yue Yi comes as a devastating surprise. Simultaneously, the other allies attack from the west. Chu declares itself an ally of Qi but contents itself with annexing some territory to its north. Qi&#x27;s armies are destroyed while the territory of Qi is reduced to the two cities of Ju and Jimo. King Min himself is later captured and executed by his own followers.

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* The Macedonian King, Demetrius Poliorcetes, faces a combined attack from Lysimachus and Phyrrhus, king of Epirus, after Seleucus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus form a coalition to block plans by Demetrius to invade Asia Minor. Ptolemy&#x27;s fleet appears off Greece, inciting the cities to revolt.
* Athens revolts and Demetrius besieges the city. Pyrrhus takes Thessaly and the western half of Macedonia and, with the assistance of Ptolemy&#x27;s fleet, relieves Athens from Demetrius&#x27; siege.
* After the Egyptian fleet participates decisively in the liberation of Athens from Macedonian occupation, Ptolemy obtains the protectorate over the League of Islanders, which includes most of the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. Egypt&#x27;s maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean in the ensuing decades is based on this alliance.

==== Sicily ====
* Following the death of Agathocles, some of his disbanded mercenaries seize Messana in northeast Sicily and set up a society, calling themselves Mamertines (Sons of Mars). The city becomes a base from which they will ravage the Sicilian countryside.

==== Sri Lanka ====
* The Sri Maha Bodhi Sacred Fig tree is planted at Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. This is the earliest known planting date for any planted tree still surviving.

==== China ====
* King Zhao of Qin and King Min of Qi take the title &quot;Di&quot;, (帝 literally emperor), of the west and east respectively. They swear a covenant and begin planning an attack on the State of Zhao.
* Qi conquers the State of Song.

<text>Philip IV (April–June 1268 – 29 November 1314), called Philip the Fair (), was King of France from 1285 to 1314. By virtue of his marriage with Joan I of Navarre, he was also King of Navarre and Count of Champagne as Philip I from 1284 to 1305. Although Philip was known to be handsome, hence the epithet &quot;le Bel&quot;, his rigid, autocratic, imposing, and inflexible personality gained him (from friend and foe alike) other nicknames, such as the Iron King (). His fierce opponent Bernard Saisset, bishop of Pamiers, said of him: &quot;He is neither man nor beast. He is a statue.&quot;

Philip, seeking to reduce the wealth and power of the nobility and clergy, relied instead on skilful civil servants, such as Guillaume de Nogaret and Enguerrand de Marigny, to govern the kingdom. The king, who sought an uncontested monarchy, compelled his vassals by wars and restricted their feudal privileges, paving the way for the transformation of France from a feudal country to a centralised early modern state. Internationally, Philip&#x27;s ambitions made him highly influential in European affairs, and for much of his reign, he sought to place his relatives on foreign thrones. Princes from his house ruled in Hungary, and he tried and failed to make another relative the Holy Roman Emperor.

The most notable conflicts of Philip&#x27;s reign include a dispute with the English over King EdwardI&#x27;s duchy in southwestern France and a war with the County of Flanders, who had rebelled against French royal authority and humiliated Philip at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302. The war with the Flemish resulted in Philip&#x27;s ultimate victory, after which he received a significant portion of Flemish cities, which were added to the crown lands along with a vast sum of money. Domestically, his reign was marked by struggles with the Jews and the Knights Templar. In heavy debt to both groups, Philip saw them as a &quot;state within the state&quot; and a recurring threat to royal power. In 1306 Philip expelled the Jews from France, followed by the total destruction of the Knights Templar in 1307. To further strengthen the monarchy, Philip tried to tax and impose state control over the Catholic Church in France, leading to a violent dispute with Pope Boniface VIII. The ensuing conflict saw the pope&#x27;s residence at Anagni attacked in September 1303 by French forces with the support of the Colonna family. Pope Boniface was captured and held hostage for several days. This eventually led to the Avignon Papacy of 1309 to 1376.

His final year saw a scandal amongst the royal family, known as the Tour de Nesle affair, in which King Philip&#x27;s three daughters-in-law were accused of adultery. His three sons were successively kings of France: Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV. Their rapid successive deaths without surviving sons of their own would compromise the future of the French royal house, which had until then seemed secure, precipitating a succession crisis that eventually led to the Hundred Years&#x27; War (1337–1453).

==Youth==
A member of the House of Capet, Philip was born in 1268 in the medieval fortress of Fontainebleau (Seine-et-Marne) to the future Philip III, the Bold, and his first wife, Isabella of Aragon. His father was the heir apparent of France, being the eldest son of King Louis IX.

In August 1270, when Philip was two years old, his grandfather died while on Crusade, his father became king, and his elder brother Louis became heir apparent. Only five months later, in January 1271, Philip&#x27;s mother died after falling from a horse; she was pregnant with her fifth child at the time and had not yet been crowned queen beside her husband. A few months later, one of Philip&#x27;s younger brothers, Robert, also died. Philip&#x27;s father was finally crowned king at Rheims on 15 August 1271. Six days later, he married again; Philip&#x27;s stepmother was Marie, daughter of the duke of Brabant.

In May 1276, Philip&#x27;s elder brother Louis died, and the eight-year-old Philip became heir apparent. It was suspected that Louis had been poisoned and that his stepmother, Marie of Brabant, had instigated the murder. One reason for these rumours was the fact that the queen had given birth to her own first son the month Louis died. However, both Philip and his surviving full brother Charles lived well into adulthood and raised large families of their own.

The scholastic part of Philip&#x27;s education was entrusted to Guillaume d&#x27;Ercuis, his father&#x27;s almoner.

After the unsuccessful Aragonese Crusade against Peter III of Aragon, which ended in October 1285, Philip may have negotiated an agreement with Peter for the safe withdrawal of the Crusader army. This pact is attested to by Catalan chroniclers. Joseph Strayer points out that such a deal was probably unnecessary, as Peter had little to gain from provoking a battle with the withdrawing French or angering the young Philip, who had friendly relations with Aragon through his mother.

Philip married Queen Joan I of Navarre (1271–1305) on 16 August 1284. The two were affectionate and devoted to each other and Philip refused to remarry after Joan&#x27;s death in 1305, despite the great political and financial rewards of doing so. The primary administrative benefit of the marriage was Joan&#x27;s inheritance of Champagne and Brie, which were adjacent to the royal demesne in Ile-de-France, and thus effectively were united to the king&#x27;s own lands, expanding his realm. The annexation of wealthy Champagne increased the royal revenues considerably, removed the autonomy of a large semi-independent fief and expanded royal territory eastward. Philip also gained Lyon for France in 1312.

Navarre remained in personal union with France, beginning in 1284 under Philip and Joan, for 44 years. The Kingdom of Navarre in the Pyrenees was poor but had a degree of strategic importance. When in 1328 the Capetian line went extinct, the new Valois king, Philip VI, attempted to permanently annex the lands to France, compensating the lawful claimant, Joan II of Navarre, senior heir of Philip IV, with lands elsewhere in France. However, pressure from Joan II&#x27;s family led to Phillip VI surrendering the land to Joan in 1329, and the rulers of Navarre and France were again different individuals.

==Reign==
After marrying Joan I of Navarre, and becoming Philip I of Navarre, Philip ascended the French throne at the age of 17. He was crowned as King on 6 January 1286 in Reims. As king, Philip was determined to strengthen the monarchy at any cost. He relied, more than any of his predecessors, on a professional bureaucracy of legalists. To the public he kept aloof, and left specific policies, especially unpopular ones, to his ministers; as such he was compared to a &quot;useless owl&quot; by Bishop Saisset. Others like William of Nogaret idealized him, praising him for his piety and support of the Church. His reign marks the transition to a more centralized administration, characterized by the emergence or consolidation of the King&#x27;s Council, the Parlement and the Court of Auditors, a move, under a certain historical reading, towards modernity.

==Foreign policy and wars==
===War against England===
As the duke of Aquitaine, English King Edward I was a vassal to Philip and had to pay him homage. Following the Fall of Acre in 1291, however, the former allies started to show dissent.

In 1293, following feuding between English and French sailors that led to several seized ships and the sacking of La Rochelle, Philip summoned Edward to the French court. The English king sought to negotiate the matter via ambassadors sent to Paris, but they were turned away with a blunt refusal. Philip addressed Edward as a duke, a vassal, and nothing more, despite the international implications of the relationship between England and France.

Edward next attempted to use family connections to achieve what open politics had not. He sent his brother Edmund Crouchback, who was Philip&#x27;s cousin as well as his step-father-in-law, in attempts to negotiate with the French royal family and avert war. Additionally, Edward had by that time become betrothed by proxy to Philip&#x27;s sister Margaret, and, in the event of the negotiations being successful, Edmund was to escort Margaret back to England for her wedding to Edward.

An agreement was indeed reached; it stated that Edward would temporarily relinquish Gascony to Philip as a sign of submission in his capacity as the duke of Aquitaine. In return, Philip would forgive Edward and restore Gascony after a grace period. Philip would also revoke the previous summons to Edward to appear in the parliament of Paris, and meet the English king at Amiens. It was further agreed that Edward was to marry Philip IV&#x27;s sister Margaret. On 3 February 1294, orders were given by Edward I to allow the French to take possession of the Gascon strongholds.

Philip IV, however, again summoned Edward I on 21 April, to appear personally before the French court. Edward rejected the summons, and on 19 May he was forfeited of Aquitaine, Gascony and other French possessions for failure to appear in person. A French army was then sent to occupy the confiscated territories. In response Edward I renounced his homage to Philip IV and began preparations for war. 

The ensuing 1294–1303 Gascon War was the inevitable result of the competitive expansionist monarchies, but the direct campaigns between the two countries in Aquitaine and Flanders were inconclusive. Instead, the larger consequences were from the taxation undertaken to pay for them and in the alliances used. France initiated the Auld Alliance between itself and Scotland, underwriting much of the prolonged First Scottish War of Independence. Meanwhile, England assisted Flanders in its own war against France; the decimation of a generation of French nobility at the Battle of the Golden Spurs forced Philip to abandon his occupation of Aquitaine.

Pursuant to the terms of the interim 1299 Treaty of Montreuil, the marriage of Philip&#x27;s young daughter Isabella to Edward&#x27;s son EdwardII was celebrated at Boulogne on 25 January 1308. Meant to further seal a lasting peace, it eventually produced an English claimant to the French throne itself, leading to the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

===War with Flanders===
Philip suffered a major setback when an army of 2,500 noble men-at-arms (knights and squires) and 4,000 infantry he sent to suppress an uprising in Flanders was defeated in the Battle of the Golden Spurs near Kortrijk on 11 July 1302. Philip reacted with energy two years later at the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle, which ended in a decisive French victory. Consequently, in 1305, Philip forced the Flemish to accept a harsh peace treaty which exacted heavy reparations and penalties and added to the royal territory the rich cloth cities of Lille, Douai, and Bethune, sites of major cloth fairs. Béthune, first of the Flemish cities to yield, was granted to Mahaut, Countess of Artois, whose two daughters, to secure her fidelity, were married to Philip&#x27;s two sons.

===Crusades and diplomacy with Mongols===

Philip had various contacts with the Mongol power in the Middle East, including reception at the embassy of the Uyghur monk Rabban Bar Sauma, originally from the Yuan dynasty of China. Bar Sauma presented an offer of a Franco-Mongol alliance with Arghun of the Mongol Ilkhanate in Baghdad. Arghun was seeking to join forces between the Mongols and the Europeans, against their common enemy the Muslim Mamluks. In return, Arghun offered to return Jerusalem to the Christians, once it was re-captured from the Muslims. Philip seemingly responded positively to the request of the embassy by sending one of his noblemen, Gobert de Helleville, to accompany Bar Sauma back to Mongol lands. There was further correspondence between Arghun and Philip in 1288 and 1289, outlining potential military cooperation. However, Philip never actually pursued such military plans.

In April 1305, the new Mongol ruler Öljaitü sent letters to Philip, the Pope, and Edward I of England. He again offered a military collaboration between the Christian nations of Europe and the Mongols against the Mamluks. European nations attempted another Crusade but were delayed, and it never took place. On 4 April 1312, another Crusade was promulgated at the Council of Vienne. In 1313, Philip &quot;took the cross&quot;, making the vow to go on a Crusade in the Levant, thus responding to Pope Clement V&#x27;s call. He was, however, warned against leaving by Enguerrand de Marigny and died soon after in a hunting accident.

==Finance and religion==

===Mounting deficits===
Under Philip IV, the annual ordinary revenues of the French royal government totalled approximately 860,000 &quot;livres tournois&quot;, equivalent to 46 tonnes of silver. Overall revenues were about twice the ordinary revenues. Some 30% of the revenues were collected from the royal demesne. The royal financial administration employed perhaps 3,000 people, of which about 1,000 were officials in the proper sense. After assuming the throne, Philip inherited a sizable debt from his father&#x27;s war against Aragon. By November 1286 it reached 8 tonnes of silver to his primary financiers, the Templars, equivalent to 17% of government revenue. This debt was quickly paid off, and, in 1287 and 1288, Philip&#x27;s kingdom ran a budget surplus.

After 1289, a decline in Saxony&#x27;s silver production, combined with Philip&#x27;s wars against Aragon, England and Flanders, drove the French government to fiscal deficits. The war against Aragon, inherited from Philip&#x27;s father, required the expenditure of 1.5 million LT (livres tournois) and the 1294–99 war against England over Gascony another 1.73 million LT. Loans from the Aragonese War were still being paid back in 1306.

To cover the deficit, Pope Nicholas IV in 1289 granted Philip permission to collect a tithe of 152,000 LP (livres parisis) from the Church lands in France. With revenues of 1.52 million LP, the church in France had greater fiscal resources than the royal government, whose ordinary revenues in 1289 amounted to 595,318 LP and overall revenues to 1.2 million LP. By November 1290, the deficit stood at 6% of revenues. In 1291 the budget swung back into surplus only to fall into deficit again in 1292.

The constant deficits led Philip to order the arrest of the Lombard merchants, who had earlier made him extensive loans on the pledge of repayment from future taxation. The Lombards&#x27; assets were seized by government agents and the crown extracted 250,000 LT by forcing the Lombards to purchase French nationality. Despite this draconian measure, the deficits continued to stack up in 1293. By 1295, Philip had replaced the Templars with the Florentine Franzesi bankers as his main source of finance. The Italians could raise huge loans far beyond the capacities of the Templars, and Philip came to rely on them more and more. The royal treasure was transferred from the Paris Temple to the Louvre around this time.

===Devaluation===

In 1294, France and England went to war and in 1297, the county of Flanders declared its independence from France. This conflict accelerated the financial problems incurred by the French monarch. As warfare continued and fiscal deficits persisted, Philip had no remedy but to use debasement of coinage as an alternative tool to meet his military expenditures. This measure made people wary of taking their coins to royal mints, preferring to take their silver abroad to exchange it for strong currencies, which by 1301 led to a dramatic disappearance of silver in France. Currency depreciation provided the crown with 1.419 million LP from November 1296 to Christmas 1299, more than enough to cover war costs of 1.066 million LP in the same period.

The resulting inflation damaged the real incomes of the creditors such as the aristocracy and the Church, who received a weaker currency in return for the loans they had issued in a stronger currency. The indebted lower classes did not benefit from the devaluation, as the high inflation ate into the purchasing power of their money. The result was social unrest. By 22 August 1303 this practice led to a two-thirds loss in the value of the &quot;livres, sous&quot; and &quot;deniers&quot; in circulation.

The defeat at the battle of Golden Spurs in 1302 was a crushing blow to French finance: the 15 months which followed this battle saw a depreciation of the currency by 37%, and new decrees were issued forbidding the export of gold and silver abroad. The royal government had to order officials and subjects to provide all or half, respectively, of their silver vessels for minting into coins. New taxes were levied to pay for the deficit. As people attempted to move their wealth out of the country in non-monetary form, Philip banned merchandise exports without royal approval. The king obtained another crusade tithe from the pope and returned the royal treasure to the Temple to gain the Templars as his creditors again.

Despite their consequences, these decisions were not considered immoral at that time, as they were the prince&#x27;s accepted right, and this right could be taken far if a special situation, such as war, justified it. Furthermore, the issue of coins with a lower content of silver was needed to maintain circulation, in a context where the inflation of silver produced a severe scarcity of currency due to the ongoing commercial revolution.

===Revaluation===
After bringing the Flemish War to a victorious conclusion in 1305, Philip on 8 June 1306 ordered the silver content of new coinage to be raised back to its 1285 level of 3.96 grams of silver per &quot;livre&quot;. To harmonize the strength of the old and new currencies, the debased coinage of 1303 was devalued accordingly by two-thirds. The debtors were driven to penury by the need to repay their loans in the new, strong currency. This led to rioting in Paris on 30 December 1306, forcing Philip to briefly seek refuge in the Paris Temple, the headquarters of the Knights Templar.

Perhaps seeking to control the silver of the Jewish mints to put the revaluation to effect, Philip ordered the expulsion of the Jews on 22 July 1306 and confiscated their property on 23 August, collecting at least 140,000 LP with this measure. With the Jews gone, Philip appointed royal guardians to collect the loans made by the Jews, and the money was passed to the Crown. His son and successor, Louis X, invited Jews back in 1315 with an offer of 12 years under a strict charter.

When Philip levied taxes on the French clergy of one-half their annual income, he caused an uproar within the Catholic Church and the papacy, prompting Pope Boniface VIII to issue the bull &quot;Clericis Laicos&quot; (1296), forbidding the transference of any church property to the French Crown. Philip retaliated by forbidding the removal of bullion from France. By 1297, Boniface agreed to Philip&#x27;s taxation of the clergy in emergencies.

In 1301, Philip had the bishop of Pamier arrested for treason. Boniface called French bishops to Rome to discuss Philip&#x27;s actions. In response, Philip convoked an assembly of bishops, nobles and grand bourgeois of Paris in order to condemn the Pope. This precursor to the Estates General appeared for the first time during his reign, a measure of the professionalism and order that his ministers were introducing into government. This assembly, which was composed of clergy, nobles, and burghers, gave support to Philip.

Boniface retaliated with the famous bull &quot;Unam Sanctam&quot; (1302), a declaration of papal supremacy. Philip gained victory, after having sent his agent Guillaume de Nogaret to arrest Boniface at Anagni. The pope escaped but died soon afterward. The French archbishop Bertrand de Goth was elected pope as Clement V and thus began the so-called Babylonian Captivity of the papacy (1309–76), during which the official seat of the papacy moved to Avignon, an enclave surrounded by French territories, and was subjected to French control.

==Suppression of the Knights Templar==

Philip was substantially in debt to the Knights Templar, a monastic military order whose original role as protectors of Christian pilgrims in the Latin East had been largely replaced by banking and other commercial activities by the end of the 13th century. As the popularity of the Crusades had decreased, support for the military orders had waned, and Philip used a disgruntled complaint against the Knights Templar as an excuse to move against the entire organization as it existed in France, in part to free himself from his debts. Other motives appear to have included concern over perceived heresy, the assertion of French control over a weakened Papacy, and finally, the substitution of royal officials for officers of the Temple in the financial management of the French government.

Recent studies emphasize the political and religious motivations of Philip the Fair and his ministers (especially Guillaume de Nogaret). It seems that, with the &quot;discovery&quot; and repression of the &quot;Templars&#x27; heresy&quot;, the Capetian monarchy claimed for itself the mystic foundations of the papal theocracy. The Temple case was the last step of the process of appropriating these foundations, which had begun with the Franco-papal rift at the time of Boniface VIII. Being the ultimate defender of the Catholic faith, the Capetian king was invested with a Christ-like function that put him above the pope. What was at stake in the Templars&#x27; trial, then, was the establishment of a &quot;royal theocracy&quot;.

At daybreak on Friday, 13 October 1307, hundreds of Templars in France were simultaneously arrested by agents of Philip the Fair, to be later tortured into admitting heresy in the Order. The Templars were supposedly answerable only to the Pope, but Philip used his influence over Clement V, who was largely his pawn, to disband the organization. Pope Clement did attempt to hold proper trials, but Philip used the previously forced confessions to have many Templars burned at the stake before they could mount a proper defence.
In March 1314, Philip had Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Temple, and Geoffroi de Charney, Preceptor of Normandy, burned at the stake. An account of the event goes as follows:
After a little over a month, Pope Clement V died of a disease thought to be lupus, and in eight months Philip IV, at the age of forty-six, died in a hunting accident. This gave rise to the legend that de Molay had cited them before the tribunal of God, which became popular among the French population. Even in Germany, Philip&#x27;s death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the Templars, and Clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his deathbed for three great crimes, namely the poisoning of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor, and the ruin of the Templars and Beguines. Within fourteen years the throne passed rapidly through Philip&#x27;s sons, who died relatively young, and without producing male heirs. By 1328, his male line was extinguished, and the throne had passed to the line of his brother, the House of Valois.

==Tour de Nesle affair==
In 1314, the daughters-in-law of Philip IV, Margaret of Burgundy (wife of Louis X) and Blanche of Burgundy (wife of Charles IV) were accused of adultery and their alleged lovers (Phillipe d&#x27;Aunay and Gauthier d&#x27;Aunay) tortured, flayed and executed in what has come to be known as the Tour de Nesle affair (). A third daughter-in-law, Joan II, Countess of Burgundy (wife of Philip V), was accused of knowledge of the affairs.
==Death==
Philip had a cerebral stroke during a hunt at Pont-Sainte-Maxence (Forest of Halatte), and died a few weeks later, on 29 November 1314, at Fontainebleau. He is buried in the Basilica of Saint-Denis. Philip was succeeded by his son Louis X.

==Issue==

The children of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre were:
# Margaret (c. 1288, Paris – d. 1300, Paris). Died in childhood, betrothed to Infante Ferdinand of Castile
# Louis X (4 October 1289 – 5 June 1316)
# Blanche (1290, Paris – after 13 April 1294, Saint Denis). Died in childhood, but betrothed in December 1291 (aged one) to &quot;Infante Ferdinand of Castile&quot;, later Ferdinand IV of Castile. Blanche was buried in the Basilica of St Denis.
# Philip V (c. 1291 – 3 January 1322)
# Charles IV (1294 – 1 February 1328)
# Isabella (c. 1295 – 23 August 1358). Married Edward II of England and was the mother of Edward III of England.
# Robert (1296, Paris – August 1308, Saint Germain-en-Laye). The &quot;Flores historiarum&quot; of Bernard Guidonis names &quot;&quot;Robertum&quot; as youngest of the four sons of Philip IV of France, adding that he died &quot;in flore adolescentiæ suæ&quot;&quot; (&quot;in the flower of youth&quot;) and was buried &quot;in monasterio sororum de Pyssiaco&quot; (&quot;in the monastery of the Sisters of Pyssiaco&quot;) in August 1308. Betrothed in October 1306 (aged ten) to Constance of Sicily.

All three of Philip&#x27;s sons who reached adulthood became kings of France and Navarre, and Isabella, his only surviving daughter, was the queen of England as consort to Edward II.

==In fiction==
Dante Alighieri often refers to Philip in &quot;La Divina Commedia&quot;, never by name but as the &quot;mal di Francia&quot; (plague of France). It is possible that Dante hides further the person of the king behind 7 figures: Cerbero, Pluto, Filippo Argenti (&quot;Philippe&quot; &quot;de l&#x27;argent&quot;), Capaneo, Gerione, Nembrot, in the &quot;Inferno,&quot; and the Giant in the &quot;Purgatorio&quot; killed by the &quot;515&quot;. These representations are centred around Capaneo, referring to the myth of the Seven against Thebes, and are related to the Beast from the Sea in the Revelation of St. John, whose seventh head, like the Giant, is also killed. Such a scheme is related to the transposition of the Revelation in history, according to the ideas of Joachim of Fiore.

Philip is the title character in &quot;Le Roi de fer&quot; (1955), translated as &quot;The Iron King&quot;, the first novel in &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;), a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon. The next six entries in the series follow the descendants of Philip, including both his sons Louis X and Philip V and his daughter Isabella of France. He was portrayed by Georges Marchal in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by Tchéky Karyo in the 2005 adaptation.

The court of Philip IV of France and Philip himself attended the execution of Jacques de Molay in &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity&quot;. In the television series &quot;Knightfall&quot; (2017), Philip is portrayed by Ed Stoppard.

<text>Year 457 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Pulvillus and Augurinus or Cincinnatus and Vibulanus (or, less frequently, year 297 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 457 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

==== Greece ====
* Athens, the leader of the Delian League, comes into conflict with Corinth and its ally Sparta (leader of the Peloponnesian League) over Megara. Nicomedes of Sparta, regent for King Pleistoanax, leads an army of 11,500 hoplites into Boeotia to help Thebes put down a rebellion by Phocis.
* Athenian forces block the routes back to the Peloponnese, so the Spartans decide to remain in Boeotia and await the Athenian attack. The Athenians and their allies, with 14,000 men under the command of Myronides, meet the Spartans at Battle of Tanagra. The Spartans win the battle, but they lose many men and so are unable to follow up on their victory.
* The Athenians regroup after the battle and march into Boeotia. Led by Myronides, the Athenians defeat the Boeotians in the Battle of Oenophyta, and then destroy the walls of Tanagra and ravage Locris and Phocis.
* Athens goes on to defeat Aegina later in the year, and to finish the construction of the Long Walls to the Athenian port of Piraeus (an action opposed by Sparta).
* Boeotia, Phocis and Opuntian Locris become members of the Delian League. Athens now has enrolled in the Delian League all the Boeotian cities except Thebes. Aegina is forced to become a member of the League. It is assessed, with Thasos, for a yearly contribution to the League of 30 talents.
* The Zeus Temple at Olympia is completed. The forty-foot statue of Zeus inside it becomes one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

<doc id="77173" wikidata="Q667" url="?curid=77173" title="South">
<text>South is one of the cardinal directions or compass points. The direction is the opposite of north and is perpendicular to both west and east.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;south&quot; comes from Old English &quot;sūþ&quot;, from earlier Proto-Germanic &quot;*sunþaz&quot; (&quot;south&quot;), possibly related to the same Proto-Indo-European root that the word &quot;sun&quot; derived from. Some languages describe south in the same way, from the fact that it is the direction of the sun at noon (in the Northern Hemisphere), like Latin meridies &#x27;noon, south&#x27; (from medius &#x27;middle&#x27; + dies &#x27;day&#x27;, cf English meridional), while others describe south as the right-hand side of the rising sun, like Biblical Hebrew תֵּימָן teiman &#x27;south&#x27; from יָמִין yamin &#x27;right&#x27;, Aramaic תַּימנַא taymna from יָמִין yamin &#x27;right&#x27; and Syriac ܬܰܝܡܢܳܐ taymna from ܝܰܡܝܺܢܳܐ yamina (hence the name of Yemen, the land to the south/right of the Levant).

South is sometimes abbreviated as S.

==Navigation==

By convention, the &quot;bottom or down-facing side&quot; of a map is south, although reversed maps exist that defy this convention. To go south using a compass for navigation, set a bearing or azimuth of 180°. Alternatively, in the Northern Hemisphere outside the tropics, the Sun will be roughly in the south at midday.

==South Pole==
True south is one end of the axis about which the Earth rotates, called the South Pole. The South Pole is located in Antarctica. Magnetic south is the direction towards the south magnetic pole, some distance away from the south geographic pole.

Roald Amundsen, from Norway, was the first person to reach the South Pole, on 14 December 1911, after Ernest Shackleton from the UK was forced to turn back some distance short.

==Geography==
The Global South refers to the socially and economically less-developed southern half of the globe. 95% of the Global North has enough food and shelter, and a functioning education system. In the South, on the other hand, only 5% of the population has enough food and shelter. It &quot;lacks appropriate technology, it has no political stability, the economies are disarticulated, and their foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports&quot;.

Use of the term &quot;South&quot; may also be country-relative, particularly in cases of noticeable economic or cultural divide. For example, the Southern United States, separated from the Northeastern United States by the Mason–Dixon line, or the South of England, which is politically and economically unmatched with all of the North of England.

Southern Cone is the name that is often referred to as the southernmost area of South America that, in the form of an inverted &quot;cone&quot;, almost like a large peninsula, encompasses Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and the entire South of Brazil (Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná and São Paulo). Rarely does the meaning broaden to Bolivia, and in the most restricted sense it only covers Chile, Argentina and Uruguay.

The country of South Africa is so named because of its location at the southern tip of Africa. Upon formation the country was named the Union of South Africa in English, reflecting its origin from the unification of four formerly separate British colonies. Australia derives its name from the Latin Terra Australis (&quot;Southern Land&quot;), a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times.

==Other uses==
In the card game bridge, one of the players is known for scoring purposes as South. South partners with North and plays against East and West.

In Greek religion, Notos, was the south wind and bringer of the storms of late summer and autumn.

<doc id="77178" wikidata="Q5916" url="?curid=77178" title="Spaceflight">
<text>Spaceflight (or space flight) is an application of astronautics to fly objects, usually spacecraft, into or through outer space, either with or without humans on board. Most spaceflight is uncrewed and conducted mainly with spacecraft such as satellites in orbit around Earth, but also includes space probes for flights beyond Earth orbit. Such spaceflights operate either by telerobotic or autonomous control. The first spaceflights began in the 1950s with the launches of the Soviet Sputnik satellites and American Explorer and Vanguard missions. Human spaceflight programs include the Soyuz, Shenzhou, the past Apollo Moon landing and the Space Shuttle programs. Other current spaceflight are conducted to the International Space Station and to China&#x27;s Tiangong Space Station.

Spaceflights include the launches of Earth observation and telecommunications satellites, interplanetary missions, the rendezvouses and dockings with space stations, and crewed spaceflights on scientific or tourist missions.

Spaceflight can be achieved conventionally via multistage rockets, which provide the thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propel spacecraft onto suborbital trajectories. If the mission is orbital, the spacecraft usually separates the first stage and ignites the second stage, which propels the spacecraft to high enough speeds that it reaches orbit. Once in orbit, spacecraft are at high enough speeds that they fall around the Earth rather than fall back to the surface.

Most spacecraft, and all crewed spacecraft, are designed to deorbit themselves or, in the case of uncrewed spacecraft in high-energy orbits, to boost themselves into graveyard orbits. Used upper stages or failed spacecraft, however, often lack the ability to deorbit themselves. This becomes a major issue when large numbers of uncontrollable spacecraft exist in frequently used orbits, increasing the risk of debris colliding with functional satellites. This problem is exacerbated when large objects, often upper stages, break up in orbit or collide with other objects, creating often hundreds of small, hard to find pieces of debris. This problem of continuous collisions is known as Kessler syndrome.

== Terminology ==
There are several terms that refer to a flight into or through outer space.

A space mission refers to a spaceflight intended to achieve an objective. Objectives for space missions may include space exploration, space research, and national firsts in spaceflight.

Space transport is the use of spacecraft to transport people or cargo into or through outer space. This may include human spaceflight and cargo spacecraft flight.

== History ==

The first theoretical proposal of space travel using rockets was published by Scottish astronomer and mathematician William Leitch, in an 1861 essay &quot;A Journey Through Space&quot;. More well-known is Konstantin Tsiolkovsky&#x27;s work, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices&quot;), published in 1903. In his work, Tsiolkovsky describes the fundamental rocket equation:

formula_1

Where:

* (formula_2) is the change in the rocket&#x27;s velocity
* (formula_3) is the exhaust velocity
* (formula_4) and (formula_5) are the initial and final masses of the rocket

This equation, known as the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, can be used to find the total formula_2, or potential change in velocity. This formula, which is still used by engineers, is a key concept of spaceflight.

Spaceflight became a practical possibility with the work of Robert H. Goddard&#x27;s publication in 1919 of his paper &quot;A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes&quot;. His application of the de Laval nozzle to liquid-fuel rockets improved efficiency enough for interplanetary travel to become possible. After further research, Goddard attempted to secure an Army contract for a rocket-propelled weapon in the first World War but his plans were foiled by the November 11, 1918 armistice with Germany. After choosing to work with private financial support, he was the first to launch a liquid-fueled rocket on March 16, 1926.

During World War II, the first guided rocket, the V-2, was developed and employed as a weapon by Nazi Germany. During a test flight in June 1944, one such rocket reached space at an altitude of , becoming the first human-made object to reach space. At the end of World War II, most of the V-2 rocket team, including its head, Wernher von Braun, surrendered to the United States, and were expatriated to work on American missiles at what became the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, producing missiles such as Juno I and Atlas. The Soviet Union, in turn, captured several V2 production facilities and built several replicas, with 5 of their 11 rockets successfully reaching their targets. (This was relatively consistent with Nazi Germany&#x27;s success rate.)

The Soviet Union developed intercontinental ballistic missiles to carry nuclear weapons as a counter measure to United States bomber planes in the 1950s. The Tsiolkovsky-influenced Sergey Korolev became the chief rocket designer, and derivatives of his R-7 Semyorka missiles were used to launch the world&#x27;s first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957.

The U.S., after the launch of Sputnik and two embarrassing failures of Vanguard rockets, launched Explorer 1 on February 1, 1958. Three years later, the USSR launched Vostok 1, carrying cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into orbit. The US responded with the suborbital launch of Alan Shepard on May 5, 1961, and the orbital launch of John Glenn on February 20, 1962. These events were followed by a pledge from U.S. President John F. Kennedy to go to the moon and the creation of the Gemini and Apollo programs. After successfully performing a rendezvous and docking and an EVA, the Gemini program ended just before the Apollo 1 tragedy. Following multiple uncrewed test flights of the Saturn 1B and the Saturn V, the U.S. launched the crewed Apollo 7 mission into low earth orbit. Shortly after its successful completion, the U.S. launched Apollo 8 (first mission to orbit the moon), Apollo 9 (first Apollo mission to launch with both the CSM and the LEM) and Apollo 10 (first mission to nearly land on the moon). These events culminated with the first crewed moon landing, Apollo 11, and six subsequent missions, five of which successfully landed on the moon.

Spaceflight has been widely employed by numerous government and commercial entities for placing satellites into orbit around Earth for a broad range of purposes. Certain government agencies have also sent uncrewed spacecraft exploring space beyond the Moon and developed continuous crewed human presence in space with a series of space stations, ranging from the &quot;Salyut&quot; program to the International Space Station.

== Phases ==
=== Launch ===

Rockets are the only means currently capable of reaching orbit or beyond. Other non-rocket spacelaunch technologies have yet to be built, or remain short of orbital speeds. A rocket launch for a spaceflight usually starts from a spaceport (cosmodrome), which may be equipped with launch complexes and launch pads for vertical rocket launches and runways for takeoff and landing of carrier airplanes and winged spacecraft. Spaceports are situated well away from human habitation for noise and safety reasons. ICBMs have various special launching facilities.

A launch is often restricted to certain launch windows. These windows depend upon the position of celestial bodies and orbits relative to the launch site. The biggest influence is often the rotation of the Earth. Once launched, orbits are normally located within relatively constant flat planes at a fixed angle to the axis of the Earth, and the Earth rotates within this orbit.

A launch pad is a fixed structure designed to dispatch airborne vehicles. It generally consists of a launch tower and flame trench. It is surrounded by equipment used to erect, fuel, and maintain launch vehicles. Before launch, the rocket can weigh hundreds of tons. The Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, on STS-1, weighed 2030 metric tons (4,480,000 lb) at takeoff.

=== Reaching space ===
The most commonly used definition of outer space is everything beyond the Kármán line, which is above the Earth&#x27;s surface. (The United States defines outer space as everything beyond in altitude.)

Rocket engines remain the only currently practical means of reaching space, with planes and high-altitude balloons failing due to lack of atmosphere and alternatives such as space elevators not yet being built. Chemical propulsion, or the acceleration of gases at high velocities, is effective mainly because of its ability to sustain thrust even as the atmosphere thins.

==== Alternatives ====
Many ways to reach space other than rocket engines have been proposed. Ideas such as the space elevator, and momentum exchange tethers like rotovators or skyhooks require new materials much stronger than any currently known. Electromagnetic launchers such as launch loops might be feasible with current technology. Other ideas include rocket-assisted aircraft/spaceplanes such as Reaction Engines Skylon (currently in early stage development), scramjet powered spaceplanes, and RBCC powered spaceplanes. Gun launch has been proposed for cargo.

=== Leaving orbit ===
On some missions beyond LEO (Low Earth Orbit), spacecraft are inserted into parking orbits, or lower intermediary orbits. The parking orbit approach greatly simplified Apollo mission planning in several important ways. It acted as a &quot;time buffer&quot; and substantially widened the allowable launch windows. The parking orbit gave the crew and controllers time to thoroughly check out the spacecraft after the stresses of launch before committing it for a long journey to the Moon.

Robotic missions do not require an abort capability and require radiation minimalization only for delicate electronics, and because modern launchers routinely meet &quot;instantaneous&quot; launch windows, space probes to the Moon and other planets generally use direct injection to maximize performance by limiting the boil off of cryogenic propellants. Although some might coast briefly during the launch sequence, they do not complete one or more full parking orbits before the burn that injects them onto an Earth escape trajectory.

The escape velocity from a celestial body decreases as the distance from the body increases. However, it is more fuel-efficient for a craft to burn its fuel as close as possible to its periapsis (lowest point); see Oberth effect.

=== Astrodynamics ===
Astrodynamics is the study of spacecraft trajectories, particularly as they relate to gravitational and propulsion effects. Astrodynamics allows for a spacecraft to arrive at its destination at the correct time without excessive propellant use. An orbital maneuvering system may be needed to maintain or change orbits.

Non-rocket orbital propulsion methods include solar sails, magnetic sails, plasma-bubble magnetic systems, and using gravitational slingshot effects.

=== Transfer energy ===
The term &quot;transfer energy&quot; means the total amount of energy imparted by a rocket stage to its payload. This can be the energy imparted by a first stage of a launch vehicle to an upper stage plus payload, or by an upper stage or spacecraft kick motor to a spacecraft.

=== Reaching space station ===

In order to reach a space station, a spacecraft would have to arrive at the same orbit and approach to a very close distance (e.g. within visual contact). This is done by a set of orbital maneuvers called space rendezvous.

After rendezvousing with the space station, the space vehicle then docks or berths with the station. Docking refers to joining of two separate free-flying space vehicles, while berthing refers to mating operations where an inactive vehicle is placed into the mating interface of another space vehicle by using a robotic arm.

=== Reentry ===

Vehicles in orbit have large amounts of kinetic energy. This energy must be discarded if the vehicle is to land safely without vaporizing in the atmosphere. Typically this process requires special methods to protect against aerodynamic heating. The theory behind reentry was developed by Harry Julian Allen. Based on this theory, reentry vehicles present blunt shapes to the atmosphere for reentry. Blunt shapes mean that less than 1% of the kinetic energy ends up as heat reaching the vehicle, and the remainder heats the atmosphere.

=== Landing and recovery ===
The Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo capsules splashed down in the sea. These capsules were designed to land at relatively low speeds with the help of a parachute. Soviet/Russian capsules for Soyuz make use of a big parachute and braking rockets to touch down on land. Spaceplanes like the Space Shuttle land like a glider.

After a successful landing, the spacecraft, its occupants, and cargo can be recovered. In some cases, recovery has occurred before landing: while a spacecraft is still descending on its parachute, it can be snagged by a specially designed aircraft. This mid-air retrieval technique was used to recover the film canisters from the Corona spy satellites.

== Types ==
=== Uncrewed ===

=== Human ===

The first human spaceflight was Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961, on which cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin of the USSR made one orbit around the Earth. In official Soviet documents, there is no mention of the fact that Gagarin parachuted the final seven miles. As of 2020, the only spacecraft regularly used for human spaceflight are Soyuz, Shenzhou, and Crew Dragon. The U.S. Space Shuttle fleet operated from April 1981 until July 2011. SpaceShipOne has conducted three human suborbital space flights.

=== Sub-orbital ===

On a sub-orbital spaceflight the spacecraft reaches space and then returns to the atmosphere after following a (primarily) ballistic trajectory. This is usually because of insufficient specific orbital energy, in which case a suborbital flight will last only a few minutes, but it is also possible for an object with enough energy for an orbit to have a trajectory that intersects the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, sometimes after many hours. Pioneer 1 was NASA&#x27;s first space probe intended to reach the Moon. A partial failure caused it to instead follow a suborbital trajectory to an altitude of before reentering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere 43 hours after launch.

The most generally recognized boundary of space is the Kármán line above sea level. (NASA alternatively defines an astronaut as someone who has flown more than above sea level.) It is not generally recognized by the public that the increase in potential energy required to pass the Kármán line is only about 3% of the orbital energy (potential plus kinetic energy) required by the lowest possible Earth orbit (a circular orbit just above the Kármán line.) In other words, it is far easier to reach space than to stay there. On May 17, 2004, Civilian Space eXploration Team launched the GoFast rocket on a suborbital flight, the first amateur spaceflight. On June 21, 2004, SpaceShipOne was used for the first privately funded human spaceflight.

=== Point-to-point ===
Point-to-point, or Earth to Earth transportation, is a category of sub-orbital spaceflight in which a spacecraft provides rapid transport between two terrestrial locations. A conventional airline route between London and Sydney, a flight that normally lasts over twenty hours, could be traversed in less than one hour. While no company offers this type of transportation today, SpaceX has revealed plans to do so as early as the 2020s using Starship. Suborbital spaceflight over an intercontinental distance requires a vehicle velocity that is only a little lower than the velocity required to reach low Earth orbit. If rockets are used, the size of the rocket relative to the payload is similar to an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). Any intercontinental spaceflight has to surmount problems of heating during atmospheric re-entry that are nearly as large as those faced by orbital spaceflight.

=== Orbital ===
A minimal orbital spaceflight requires much higher velocities than a minimal sub-orbital flight, and so it is technologically much more challenging to achieve. To achieve orbital spaceflight, the tangential velocity around the Earth is as important as altitude. In order to perform a stable and lasting flight in space, the spacecraft must reach the minimal orbital speed required for a closed orbit.

=== Interplanetary ===
Interplanetary spaceflight is flight between planets within a single planetary system. In practice, the use of the term is confined to travel between the planets of our Solar System. Plans for future crewed interplanetary spaceflight missions often include final vehicle assembly in Earth orbit, such as NASA&#x27;s Constellation program and Russia&#x27;s Kliper/Parom tandem.

=== Interstellar ===
&quot;New Horizons&quot; is the fifth spacecraft put on an escape trajectory leaving the Solar System. &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; are the earlier ones. The one farthest from the Sun is &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, which is more than 100 AU distant and is moving at 3.6 AU per year. In comparison, Proxima Centauri, the closest star other than the Sun, is 267,000 AU distant. It will take &quot;Voyager 1&quot; over 74,000 years to reach this distance. Vehicle designs using other techniques, such as nuclear pulse propulsion are likely to be able to reach the nearest star significantly faster. Another possibility that could allow for human interstellar spaceflight is to make use of time dilation, as this would make it possible for passengers in a fast-moving vehicle to travel further into the future while aging very little, in that their great speed slows down the rate of passage of on-board time. However, attaining such high speeds would still require the use of some new, advanced method of propulsion. Dynamic soaring as a way to travel across interstellar space has been proposed as well.

=== Intergalactic ===
Intergalactic travel involves spaceflight between galaxies, and is considered much more technologically demanding than even interstellar travel and, by current engineering terms, is considered science fiction. However, theoretically speaking, there is nothing to conclusively indicate that intergalactic travel is impossible. To date several academics have studied intergalactic travel in a serious manner.

== Spacecraft ==

Spacecraft are vehicles designed to operate in space.

The first &#x27;true spacecraft&#x27; is sometimes said to be Apollo Lunar Module, since this was the only crewed vehicle to have been designed for, and operated only in space; and is notable for its non-aerodynamic shape.

=== Propulsion ===
Spacecraft today predominantly use rockets for propulsion, but other propulsion techniques such as ion drives are becoming more common, particularly for uncrewed vehicles, and this can significantly reduce the vehicle&#x27;s mass and increase its delta-v.

=== Launch systems ===
Launch systems are used to carry a payload from Earth&#x27;s surface into outer space.

==== Expendable ====

Most current spaceflight uses multi-stage expendable launch systems to reach space.

==== Reusable ====

The first reusable spacecraft, the X-15, was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on 19 July 1963. The first partially reusable orbital spacecraft, the Space Shuttle, was launched by the USA on the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s flight, on 12 April 1981. During the Shuttle era, six orbiters were built, all of which flown in the atmosphere and five of which flown in space. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was used only for approach and landing tests, launching from the back of a Boeing 747 and gliding to deadstick landings at Edwards AFB, California. The first Space Shuttle to fly into space was the &quot;Columbia&quot;, followed by the &quot;Challenger&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The &quot;Endeavour&quot; was built to replace the &quot;Challenger&quot;, which was lost in January 1986. The &quot;Columbia&quot; broke up during reentry in February 2003.

The first automatic partially reusable spacecraft was the &quot;Buran&quot; (&quot;Snowstorm&quot;), launched by the USSR on 15 November 1988, although it made only one flight. This spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the US Space Shuttle, although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the American Shuttle. Lack of funding, complicated by the dissolution of the USSR, prevented any further flights of Buran.

The Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 due mainly to its old age. The Shuttle&#x27;s human transport role is to be replaced by the SpaceX Dragon 2 and CST-100 in the 2020s. The Shuttle&#x27;s heavy cargo transport role is now done by commercial launch vehicles.

Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the Ansari X Prize. The Spaceship Company has built its successor SpaceShipTwo. A fleet of SpaceShipTwos operated by Virgin Galactic planned to begin reusable private spaceflight carrying paying passengers (space tourists) in 2008, but this was delayed due to an accident in the propulsion development.

SpaceX achieved the first vertical soft landing of a reusable orbital rocket stage on December 21, 2015, after delivering 11 Orbcomm OG-2 commercial satellites into low Earth orbit.

The first Falcon 9 reflight occurred on 30 March 2017. SpaceX now routinely recovers and reuses their first stages and fairings. SpaceX is now developing a fully reusable super heavy lift rocket known as Starship, with the goal of drastically reducing the price of space exploration. As of February 2025, two Super Heavy boosters, the first stage of Starship, have been recovered.

== Challenges ==
=== Safety ===
All launch vehicles contain a huge amount of energy that is needed for some part of it to reach orbit. There is therefore some risk that this energy can be released prematurely and suddenly, with significant effects. When a Delta II rocket exploded 13 seconds after launch on January 17, 1997, there were reports of store windows away being broken by the blast.

Space is a fairly predictable environment, but there are still risks of accidental depressurization and the potential failure of equipment, some of which may be very newly developed.

In April 2004 the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety was established in the Netherlands to further international cooperation and scientific advancement in space systems safety.

=== Weightlessness ===

In a microgravity environment such as that provided by a spacecraft in orbit around the Earth, humans experience a sense of &quot;weightlessness.&quot; Short-term exposure to microgravity causes space adaptation syndrome, a self-limiting nausea caused by derangement of the vestibular system. Long-term exposure causes multiple health issues. The most significant is bone loss, some of which is permanent, but microgravity also leads to significant deconditioning of muscular and cardiovascular tissues.

=== Radiation ===
Once above the atmosphere, radiation due to the Van Allen belts, solar radiation and cosmic radiation issues occur and increase. Further away from the Earth, solar flares can give a fatal radiation dose in minutes, and the health threat from cosmic radiation significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade exposure or more.

=== Life support ===
In human spaceflight, the life support system is a group of devices that allow a human being to survive in outer space. NASA often uses the phrase Environmental Control and Life Support System or the acronym ECLSS when describing these systems for its human spaceflight missions. The life support system may supply: air, water and food. It must also maintain the correct body temperature, an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with the body&#x27;s waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites may also be necessary. Components of the life support system are life-critical, and are designed and constructed using safety engineering techniques.

=== Space weather ===

Space weather is the concept of changing environmental conditions in outer space. It is distinct from the concept of weather within a planetary atmosphere, and deals with phenomena involving ambient plasma, magnetic fields, radiation and other matter in space (generally close to Earth but also in interplanetary, and occasionally interstellar medium). &quot;Space weather describes the conditions in space that affect Earth and its technological systems. Our space weather is a consequence of the behavior of the Sun, the nature of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and our location in the Solar System.&quot;

Space weather exerts a profound influence in several areas related to space exploration and development. Changing geomagnetic conditions can induce changes in atmospheric density causing the rapid degradation of spacecraft altitude in Low Earth orbit. Geomagnetic storms due to increased solar activity can potentially blind sensors onboard spacecraft, or interfere with on-board electronics. An understanding of space environmental conditions is also important in designing shielding and life support systems for crewed spacecraft.

=== Environmental considerations ===

Exhaust pollution of rockets depends on the produced exhausts by the propellants reactions and the location of exhaustion. They mostly exhaust greenhouse gases and sometimes toxic components. Particularly at higher levels of the atmosphere the potency of exhausted gases as greenhouse gases increases considerably. Many solid rockets have chlorine in the form of perchlorate or other chemicals, and this can cause temporary local holes in the ozone layer. Re-entering spacecraft generate nitrates which also can temporarily impact the ozone layer. Most rockets are made of metals that can have an environmental impact during their construction.
While spaceflight altogether pollutes at a fraction of other human activities, it still does pollute heavily if calculated per passenger.

In addition to the atmospheric effects there are effects on the near-Earth space environment. There is the possibility that orbit could become inaccessible for generations due to exponentially increasing space debris caused by spalling of satellites and vehicles (Kessler syndrome). Many launched vehicles today are therefore designed to be re-entered after use.

=== Regulation ===
A wide range of issues such as space traffic management or liability have been issues of spaceflight regulation.

Participation and representation of all humanity in spaceflight is an issue of international space law ever since the first phase of space exploration. Even though some rights of non-spacefaring countries have been secured, sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized as imperialist and lacking, understanding spaceflight as a resource.

=== Access ===
Inclusion has been a national and international issue, resulting in 1967 in the Outer Space Treaty and its claim of outer space as the &quot;province of all mankind&quot;. Furthermore social inclusion in human spaceflight has been demanded, with women to fly to space being limited, and minorities, like people with disability, only having been selected in European Space Agency&#x27;s 2022 astronaut group.

The dominating issue about access in most recent years has been the issue of space debris and space sustainability, since established spacefaring countries endanger access to outer space with their orbital space polluting activity.

== Applications ==
Current and proposed applications for spaceflight include:
* Earth observation satellites such as spy satellites, weather satellites
* Space exploration
* Communication satellites
* Satellite television
* Satellite navigation
* Space telescopes
* Space tourism
* Protecting Earth from potentially hazardous objects
* Space colonization

Most early spaceflight development was paid for by governments. However, today major launch markets such as communication satellites and satellite television are purely commercial, though many of the launchers were originally funded by governments.

Private spaceflight is a rapidly developing area: space flight that is not only paid for by corporations or even private individuals, but often provided by private spaceflight companies. These companies often assert that much of the previous high cost of access to space was caused by governmental inefficiencies they can avoid. This assertion can be supported by much lower published launch costs for private space launch vehicles such as Falcon 9 developed with private financing. Lower launch costs and excellent safety will be required for the applications such as space tourism and especially space colonization to become feasible for expansion.

==Spacefaring==

To be spacefaring is to be capable of and active in the operation of spacecraft. It involves a knowledge of a variety of topics and development of specialised skills including: aeronautics; astronautics; programs to train astronauts; space weather and forecasting; spacecraft operations; operation of various equipment; spacecraft design and construction; atmospheric takeoff and reentry; orbital mechanics (a.k.a. astrodynamics); communications; engines and rockets; execution of evolutions such as towing, microgravity construction, and space docking; cargo handling equipment, dangerous cargos and cargo storage; spacewalking; dealing with emergencies; survival at space and first aid; fire fighting; life support. The degree of knowledge needed within these areas is dependent upon the nature of the work and the type of vessel employed. &quot;Spacefaring&quot; is analogous to seafaring.

There has never been a crewed mission outside the Earth–Moon system. However, the United States, Russia, China, European Space Agency (ESA) countries, and a few corporations and enterprises have plans in various stages to travel to Mars (see Human mission to Mars).

Spacefaring entities can be sovereign states, supranational entities, and private corporations. Spacefaring nations are those capable of independently building and launching craft into space. A growing number of private entities have become or are becoming spacefaring.

=== Global coordination ===
The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) has been the main multilateral body servicing international contact and exchange on space activity among spacefaring and non-spacefaring states.

===Crewed spacefaring nations===
Currently Russia, the United States and China are the only crewed spacefaring nations.
Spacefaring nations listed by date of first crewed launch:
# Soviet Union (Russia) (1961)
# United States (1961)
# China (2003)

===Uncrewed spacefaring nations===

The following nations or organizations have developed their own launch vehicles to launch uncrewed spacecraft into orbit either from their own territory or with foreign assistance (date of first launch in parentheses):

# Soviet Union (1957)
# United States (1958)
# France (1965)
# Italy (1967)★
# Australia (1967)★
# Japan (1970)
# China (1970)
# United Kingdom (1971)
# European Space Agency (1979)
# India (1980)
# Israel (1988)
# Ukraine (1991)*
# Russia (1992)*
# Iran (2009)
# North Korea (2012)
# South Korea (2013)★
# New Zealand (2018)★
* *Previously a major region in the Soviet Union
* ★Launch vehicle fully or partially developed by another country

Also several countries, such as Canada, Italy, and Australia, had semi-independent spacefaring capability, launching locally-built satellites on foreign launchers. Canada had designed and built satellites (&quot;Alouette 1&quot; and 2) in 1962 and 1965 which were orbited using U.S. launch vehicles. Italy has designed and built several satellites, as well as pressurized modules for the International Space Station. Early Italian satellites were launched using vehicles provided by NASA, first from Wallops Flight Facility in 1964 and then from a spaceport in Kenya (San Marco Platform) between 1967 and 1988; Italy has led the development of the Vega rocket programme within the European Space Agency since 1998. The United Kingdom abandoned its independent space launch program in 1972 in favour of co-operating with the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) on launch technologies until 1974. Australia abandoned its launcher program shortly after the successful launch of WRESAT, and became the only non-European member of ELDO.

===Suborbital===
Considering merely launching an object beyond the Kármán line to be the minimum requirement of spacefaring, Germany, with the V-2 rocket, became the first spacefaring nation in 1944. The following nations have only achieved suborbital spaceflight capability by launching indigenous rockets or missiles or both into suborbital space:

# Nazi Germany (June 20, 1944)
# East Germany (April 12, 1957)
# Canada (September 5, 1959)
# Lebanon (November 21, 1962)
# Switzerland (October 27, 1967)
# Argentina (April 16, 1969)
# Brazil (September 21, 1976)
# Spain (February 18, 1981)
# West Germany (March 1, 1981)
# Iraq (June 1984)
# South Africa (June 1, 1989)
# Sweden (May 8, 1991)
# Yemen (May 12, 1994)
# Pakistan (April 6, 1998)
# Taiwan (December 15, 1998)
# Syria (September 1, 2000)
