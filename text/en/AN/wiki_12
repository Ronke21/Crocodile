<text>The Wild Hunt is a folklore motif occurring across various northern, western and eastern European societies, appearing in the religions of the Germans, Celts, and Slavs (motif E501 per Thompson). Wild Hunts typically involve a chase led by a mythological figure escorted by a ghostly or supernatural group of hunters engaged in pursuit. The leader of the hunt is often a named figure associated with Odin in Germanic legends, but may variously be a historical or legendary figure like Theodoric the Great, the Danish king , the dragon slayer Sigurd, the psychopomp of Welsh mythology , biblical figures such as Herod, Cain, Gabriel, or the Devil, or an unidentified lost soul. The hunters are generally the souls of the dead or ghostly dogs, sometimes fairies, valkyries, or elves.

Seeing the Wild Hunt was thought to forebode some catastrophe such as war or plague, or at best the death of the one who witnessed it. People encountering the Hunt might also be abducted to the underworld or the fairy kingdom. In some instances, it was also believed that people&#x27;s spirits could be pulled away during their sleep to join the cavalcade.

The concept was developed by Jacob Grimm in his (1835) on the basis of comparative mythology. Grimm believed that a group of stories represented a folkloristic survival of Germanic paganism, but this is disputed by other, modern scholars who claim that comparable folk myths are found throughout Northern Europe, Western Europe, and Central Europe. Lotte Motz noted, however, that the motif abounds &quot;above all in areas of Germanic speech.&quot; Grimm popularised the term (&#x27;Wild Hunt&#x27;) for the phenomenon.

==Comparative evidence and terminology==
=== Germanic tradition ===
Based on the comparative study of the German folklore, the phenomenon is often referred to as (German: &#x27;Wild Hunt/chase&#x27;) or (&#x27;Raging Host/army&#x27;). The term &#x27;Hunt&#x27; was more common in northern Germany and &#x27;Host&#x27; was more used in Southern Germany; with however no clear dividing line since parts of southern Germany know the &#x27;Hunt&#x27;, and parts of the north know the &#x27;Host&#x27;. It was also known in Germany as the (&#x27;Wild Army&#x27;), its leader was given various identities, including Wodan (or &quot;Woden&quot;), Knecht Ruprecht (compare Krampus), Berchtold (or Berchta), and Holda (or &quot;Holle&quot;). The Wild Hunt is also known from post-medieval folklore.

In England, it was known as (Old English: &#x27;Herla&#x27;s assembly&#x27;), &quot;Woden&#x27;s Hunt&quot;, &quot;Herod&#x27;s Hunt&quot;, &quot;Cain&#x27;s Hunt&quot;, the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Dandy Dogs&quot; (in Cornwall), &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Hounds&quot; (in northern England), and &quot;Ghost Riders&quot; (in North America).

In Scandinavia, the Wild Hunt is known as (commonly interpreted as &#x27;The Asgard Ride&#x27;), and as (&#x27;Odin&#x27;s Hunters&#x27;). The names (&#x27;Asgard Ride&#x27; as attested in parts of Trøndelag), and (Swedish: &#x27;the hunt of Odin&#x27; and &#x27;wild hunt&#x27;) are also attested. At the very front of Oskoreia rides Guro Rysserova (&#x27;Gudrun Horsetail&#x27;), often called &quot;Guro Åsgard&quot;, who is &quot;big and horrid, her horse black and called Skokse (...)&quot;

There is disagreement about the etymology of the word . The first element has several proposed sources: &quot;Åsgård&quot; (&#x27;Asgard&#x27;), &quot;oska&quot; (&#x27;thunder&#x27;), or Old Norse &quot;ǫskurligr&quot; (&#x27;dreadful&#x27;). The hypothetical &quot;Ásgoðreið&quot; (&#x27;Æsir God Ride&#x27;) was also once proposed. Only the second element, (&#x27;ride&#x27;) from Old Norse , is uncontroversial. The word was popularly perceived to be connected to Asgard, as seen in the folk ballad of Sigurd Svein, who is taken to Asgard by Oskoreia and Guro Rysserova.

In the Netherlands and Flanders (in northern Belgium), the Wild Hunt is known as the Buckriders (Dutch: Bokkenrijders) and was used by gangs of highwaymen for their advantage in the 18th century.

=== Europe ===
In Welsh folklore, was depicted as a wild huntsman riding a demon horse who hunts souls at night along with a pack of white-bodied and red-eared &quot;dogs of hell&quot;. In Arthurian legends, he is the king of the underworld who makes sure that the imprisoned devils do not destroy human souls. A comparable Welsh folk myth is known as (Welsh: &quot;hounds of Annwn&quot;).

In France, the &quot;Host&quot; was known in Latin sources as and in Old French as (the &quot;household or retinue of Hellequin&quot;). The Old French name was probably borrowed from Middle English (Old English ) by the Romance-speaking Norman invaders of Britain. Other similar figures appear in the French folklore, such as , a hunter who chased with dogs in the forest of Fontainebleau, and a Poitou tradition where a hunter who has faulted by hunting on Sunday is condemned to redeem himself by hunting during the night, along with its French Canadian version the .

Among West Slavs, it is known as or (Czech: &quot;wild hunt&quot;, &quot;baiting&quot;), &quot;dzëwô/dzëkô jachta&quot; (Kashubian: &quot;wild hunt&quot;), &quot;Dziki Gon&quot; or (Polish). It is also known among the Sorbs and among the South Slavic Slovenes (Slovene: &quot;the wild hunting party&quot; or &quot;wild hunt&quot;). However, scholars of Slavic folklore have noted it is a motif of foreign, specifically German(ic), origin. In Belarusian, it is called Дзiкае Паляванне (Belarusian: &quot;wild hunt&quot;). As Belarus used to be part of Poland, the motif&#x27;s presence likely came from there as an intermediary.

In Italy, it is called (&quot;Dead Hunt&quot;), (&quot;infernal hunt&quot;) or (&quot;Wild Hunt&quot;)

In Spain this myth is documented at least since the 13th century, under the name (&quot;Old army&quot;), today . In Galician is known as (from &quot;the old army&quot;), and (&quot;troop, company&quot;); in Asturias; (&quot;troop of ghosts&quot;) in León; and (&quot;war company&quot;) or (&quot;deadly retinue&quot;) in Extremadura.

==Historiography==
The concept of the Wild Hunt was first documented by the German folklorist Jacob Grimm who first published it in his 1835 book &quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot;. It was in this work that he popularized the term &quot;Wilde Jagd&quot; (&quot;Wild Hunt&quot;) for the phenomenon. Grimm&#x27;s methodological approach was rooted in the idea, common in nineteenth-century Europe, that modern folklore represented a fossilized survival of the beliefs of the distant past. In developing his idea of the Wild Hunt, he mixed together recent folkloric sources with textual evidence dating to the medieval and early modern periods. This approach came to be criticized within the field of folkloristics during the 20th century as more emphasis was placed on the &quot;dynamic and evolving nature of folklore&quot;.

Grimm interpreted the Wild Hunt phenomenon as having pre-Christian origins, arguing that the male figure who appeared in it was a survival of folk beliefs about the god Wodan who had &quot;lost his sociable character, his near familiar features, and assumed the aspect of a dark and dreadful power... a specter and a devil.&quot; Grimm believed that this male figure was sometimes replaced by a female counterpart, whom he referred to as Holda and Berchta. In his words, &quot;not only Wuotan and other gods, but heathen goddesses too, may head the furious host: the wild hunter passes into the wood-wife, Wôden into &quot;Frau Gaude&quot;.&quot; He added his opinion that this female figure was Woden&#x27;s wife.

Discussing martial elements of the Wild Hunt, Grimm commented that &quot;it marches as an army, it portends the outbreak of war.&quot; He added that a number of figures that had been recorded as leading the hunt, such as &quot;&quot;Wuotan, Huckelbernd, Berholt,&quot; bestriding their &quot;white war-horse&quot;, armed and spurred, appear still as &quot;supreme directors of the war&quot; for which they, so to speak, give license to mankind.&quot;

Grimm believed that in pre-Christian Europe, the hunt, led by a god and a goddess, either visited &quot;the land at some holy tide, bringing welfare and blessing, accepting gifts and offerings of the people&quot; or they alternately float &quot;unseen through the air, perceptible in cloudy shapes, in the roar and howl of the winds, carrying on &quot;war&quot;, &quot;hunting&quot; or the game of &quot;ninepins&quot;, the chief employments of ancient heroes: an array which, less tied down to a definite time, explains more the natural phenomenon.&quot; He believed that under the influence of Christianisation, the story was converted from being that of a &quot;solemn march of gods&quot; to being &quot;a pack of horrid spectres, dashed with dark and devilish ingredients&quot;. A little earlier, in 1823, Felicia Hemans records this legend in her poem &quot;The Wild Huntsman&quot;, linking it here specifically to the castles of Rodenstein and Schnellerts and to the Odenwald.

In the influential book &quot;Kultische Geheimbünde der Germanen&quot; (1934), Otto Höfler argued that the German motifs of the &quot;Wild Hunt&quot; should be interpreted as the spectral troops led by the god Wuotan which had a ritualistic counterpart in the living bands of ecstatic warriors (Old Norse &quot;berserkir&quot;), allegedly in a cultic union with the dead warriors of the past.
Hans Peter Duerr (1985) noted that for modern readers, it &quot;is generally difficult to decide, on the basis of the sources, whether what is involved in the reports about the appearance of the Wild Hunt is merely a demonic &quot;interpretation&quot; of natural phenomenon, or whether we are dealing with a description of ritual processions of humans changed into demons.&quot; Historian Ronald Hutton noted that there was &quot;a powerful and well-established international scholarly tradition&quot; which argued that the medieval Wild Hunt legends were an influence on the development of the early modern ideas of the Witches&#x27; Sabbath. Hutton nevertheless believed that this approach could be &quot;fundamentally challenged&quot;.

Lotte Motz noted that the motif is found &quot;above all in areas of Germanic speech.&quot; While found in areas once settled by Celts, these legends are told less frequently and they are not encountered in the Mediterranean regions, &quot;at least not easily&quot;.

==Attestations==
===Germany===
An abundance of different tales of the Wild Hunt has been recorded in Germany. The leader, often called &quot;der Schimmelreiter&quot;, is generally identified with the god Wotan, but sometimes with a feminine figure: the wife of Wotan, Holda (&#x27;the friendly one&#x27;; also Holle or Holt), Fru Waur, or Fru Gode in Northern Germany; or Perchta (the bright one; also Berchta, Berhta or Berta) in Southern Germany. The leader also is sometimes an undead noble, most often called Count Hackelberg or Count Ebernburg, who is cursed to hunt eternally because of misbehaviour during his lifetime, and in some versions died from injuries of a slain boar&#x27;s tusk.

Dogs and wolves were generally involved. In some areas, werewolves were depicted as stealing beer and sometimes food in houses. Horses were portrayed as two-, three-, six-, and eight-legged, often with fiery eyes. In the &#x27;Host&#x27; variants, principally found in southern Germany, a man went out in front, warning people to get out of the streets before the coming of the Host&#x27;s armed men, who were sometimes depicted as doing battle with one another. A feature peculiar to the &#x27;Hunt&#x27; version, generally encountered in northern Germany, was the pursuit and capture of one or more female demons, or a hart in some versions, while some others did not have prey at all.

Sometimes, the tales associate the hunter with a dragon or the devil. The lone hunter (&quot;der Wilde Jäger&quot;) is most often riding a horse, seldom a horse-drawn carriage, and usually has several hounds in his company. If the prey is mentioned, it is most often a young woman, either guilty or innocent. Gottfried August Bürger&#x27;s ballad &quot;Der wilde Jäger&quot; describes the fate of a nobleman who dares to hunt on the Sabbath and finds both a curse and a pack of demons deep in the woods. He might also have asked God to let him hunt until Judgement Day, as has &quot;ewiger Jäger&quot; (the eternal hunter).

The majority of the tales deal with some person encountering the Wild Hunt. If this person stands up against the hunters, he will be punished. If he helps the hunt, he will be awarded money, gold, or, most often, a leg of a slain animal or human, which is often cursed in a way that makes it impossible to be rid of it. In this case, the person has to find a priest or magician able to ban it or trick the Wild Hunt into taking the leg back by asking for salt, which the hunt can not deliver. In many versions, a person staying right in the middle of the road during the encounter is safe.

===Scandinavia===

In Scandinavia, the leader of the hunt was Odin and the event was referred to as &quot;Odens jakt&quot; (&quot;Odin&#x27;s hunt&quot;) and &quot;Oskoreia&quot; (from &quot;Asgårdsreien&quot; – &quot;the Asgard Ride&quot;). Odin&#x27;s hunt was heard but rarely seen, and a typical trait is that one of Odin&#x27;s dogs was barking louder and a second one fainter. Besides one or two shots, these barks were the only sounds that were clearly identified. When Odin&#x27;s hunt was heard, it meant changing weather in many regions, but it could also mean war and unrest. According to some reports, the forest turned silent and only a whining sound and dog barks could be heard.

In western Sweden and sometimes in the east as well, it has been said that Odin was a nobleman or even a king who had hunted on Sundays and therefore was doomed to hunt down and kill supernatural beings until the end of time. According to certain accounts, Odin does not ride, but travels in a wheeled vehicle, specifically a one-wheeled cart.

In parts of Småland, it appears that people believed that Odin hunted with large birds when the dogs got tired. When it was needed, he could transform a bevy of sparrows into an armed host.

If houses were built on former roads, they could be burnt down, because Odin did not change his plans if he had formerly travelled on a road there. Not even charcoal kilns could be built on disused roads, because if Odin was hunting the kiln would be ablaze.

One tradition maintains that Odin did not travel further up than an ox wears his yoke, so if Odin was hunting, it was safest to throw oneself onto the ground in order to avoid being hit, a pourquoi story that evolved as an explanation for the popular belief that persons lying at ground level are safer from lightning strikes than are persons who are standing. In Älghult in Småland, it was safest to carry a piece of bread and a piece of steel when going to church and back during Yule. The reason was that if one met the rider with the broad-rimmed hat, one should throw the piece of steel in front of oneself, but if one met his dogs first, one should throw the pieces of bread instead. 

=== Britain ===
In the &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot;, there is an account of the Wild Hunt&#x27;s appearance at night, beginning with the appointment of a disastrous abbot for the monastery, Henry d&#x27;Angely, in 1127:


Reliable witnesses were said to have given the number of huntsmen as twenty or thirty, and it is said, in effect, that this went on for nine weeks, ending at Easter. Orderic Vitalis (1075–c. 1142), an English monk cloistered at St Evroul-en-Ouche, in Normandy, reported a similar cavalcade seen in January 1091, which he said were &quot;Herlechin&#x27;s troop&quot; (&quot;familia Herlechini&quot;; cf. Harlequin).

While these earlier reports of Wild Hunts were recorded by clerics and portrayed as diabolic, in late medieval romances, such as &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot;, the hunters are rather from a faery otherworld, where the Wild Hunt was the hosting of the fairies; its leaders also varied, but they included Gwydion, Gwynn ap Nudd, King Arthur, Nuada, King Herla, Woden, the Devil and Herne the Hunter. Many legends are told of their origins, as in that of &quot;Dando and his dogs&quot; or &quot;the dandy dogs&quot;: Dando, wanting a drink but having exhausted what his huntsmen carried, declared he would go to hell for it. A stranger came and offered a drink, only to steal Dando&#x27;s game and then Dando himself, with his dogs giving chase. The sight was long claimed to have been seen in the area. Another legend recounted how King Herla, having visited the Fairy King, was warned not to step down from his horse until the greyhound he carried jumped down; he found that three centuries had passed during his visit, and those of his men who dismounted crumbled to dust; he and his men are still riding, because the greyhound has yet to jump down.

The myth of the Wild Hunt has through the ages been modified to accommodate other gods and folk heroes, among them King Arthur and, more recently, in a Dartmoor folk legend, Sir Francis Drake. At Cadbury Castle in Somerset, an old lane near the castle was called King Arthur&#x27;s Lane and even in the 19th century, the idea survived that on wild winter nights the king and his hounds could be heard rushing along with it.

In certain parts of Britain, the hunt is said to be that of hell-hounds chasing sinners or the unbaptized. In Devon these are known as Yeth (Heath) or Wisht Hounds, in Cornwall Dando and his Dogs or the Devil and his Dandy Dogs, in Wales the Cwn Annwn, the Hounds of Hell, and in Somerset as Gabriel Ratchets or Retchets (dogs). In Devon the hunt is particularly associated with Wistman&#x27;s Wood.

=== Iberia ===
The Santa Compaña (known also in Galician as: &quot;Rolda&quot;, &quot;As da nuite&quot;, &quot;Pantalla&quot;, &quot;Avisóns&quot; or &quot;Pantaruxada&quot;; in Asturian as &quot;Güestia&quot;, &quot;Güeste&quot;, &quot;Güestida&quot; or &quot;Güéstiga&quot;; in Spanish as &quot;Estantigua&quot;) is a mythical belief in Northwestern Spain and northern Portugal which consists in a procession of ghosts or souls. The procession is led by a living person (usually a parishioner of a particular church) carrying a cross or a cauldron of holy water (sometimes they carry both), followed by several of the souls of the dead holding lit candles.

=== Balkans ===
The South Slavic folklore of the Balkans features a supernatural procession of horsemen known as the Todorci that occurs on the first week of the Great Lent (known as the Todor or St. Theodore Week) and attacks the people who consume or cook meat and dairy products. Sometimes these horsemen are instead depicted as monstrous centauric creatures whose torsos grow out of the horses&#x27; backs, not too dissimilarly to the traditional depiction of the Nuckelavee. The horseshoe-shaped wounds inflicted by the hooves of their steeds don&#x27;t heal naturally; instead, the victim must visit the site of the attack one year later, where the wounds will either magically heal instantaneously if he&#x27;s been living piously for the previous year, or kill him if he&#x27;s been living sinfully. They can be defended against with garlic or an improvised cross made from forks or knives.

In Serbia, stories involving the Todorci are generally concentrated in the north-west of the country. They&#x27;re traditionally depicted as a procession of horsemen whose steeds lack tails. They usually appear on the night between Monday and Tuesday of the Todor Week. They&#x27;re led by an elder man called Great Todor wearing a white cloak and riding a lame white horse. Certain versions of the story claim that he is St. Theodore himself.

== Interpretations ==
According to scholar Susan Greenwood, the Wild Hunt &quot;primarily concerns an initiation into the wild, untamed forces of nature in its dark and chthonic aspects.&quot;
==Leader of the Wild Hunt==
* Brittany: King Arthur.
* Catalonia (Spain): Count Arnau (el comte Arnau), a legendary nobleman from Ripollès, who for his rapacious cruelty and lechery is condemned to ride with hounds for eternity while his flesh is devoured by flames. He is the subject of a classic traditional Catalan ballad. In the rest of Spain there are other legends about this same motive (Galician Santa Compaña, Asturian Güestia, Castilian Estantigua, Leonese Estadea...), similarly sometimes you can find some historical figure or mythical hero related.

* Wales: Arawn or Gwyn ap Nudd, the Welsh god of the Underworld.
* The Balkans: St. Theodore.
* Slovenia: Jarnik (Jarilo), also called &quot;Volčji pastir&quot; (Wolf Herdsman). In some variations the mythical wild Baba (similar to Perchta) leads the hunt; in others, the leader of this retinue is a female character named &quot;Pehtra&quot;.

==Modern influence==
===On Santa Claus===
The role of Wotan&#x27;s Wild Hunt during the Yuletide period has been theorized to have influenced the development of the Dutch Christmas figure Sinterklaas, and by extension his American counterpart Santa Claus, in a variety of facets. These include his long white beard and his gray horse for nightly rides.

===In modern paganism===
Various practitioners of the contemporary pagan religion of Wicca have drawn upon folklore involving the Wild Hunt to inspire their own rites. In their context, the leader of the Wild Hunt is the goddess Hecate. The anthropologist Susan Greenwood provided an account of one such Wild Hunt ritual performed by a modern Pagan group in Norfolk during the late 1990s, stating that they used this mythology &quot;as a means of confronting the dark of nature as a process of initiation.&quot; Referred to as the &quot;Wild Hunt Challenge&quot; by those running it, it took place on Halloween and involved participants walking around a local area of woodland in the daytime, and then repeating that task as a timed competition at night, &quot;to gain mastery over an area of Gwyn ap Nudd&#x27;s hunting ground&quot;. If completed successfully, it was held that the participant had gained the trust of the wood&#x27;s spirits, and they would be permitted to cut timber from its trees with which to make a staff. The anthropologist Rachel Morgain reported a &quot;ritual recreation&quot; of the Wild Hunt among the Reclaiming tradition of Wicca in San Francisco.

== In popular culture ==

The &quot;Åsgårdsreien&quot;, Peter Nicolai Arbo&#x27;s 1872 oil painting, depicts the Scandinavian version of the Wild Hunt, with Thor leading the hunting party. This painting is featured on the cover of Bathory&#x27;s 1988 album, &quot;Blood Fire Death&quot;.

=== Music ===
The Wild Hunt is the subject of Transcendental Étude No. 8 in C minor, &quot;Wilde Jagd&quot; (Wild Hunt) by Franz Liszt, and appears in Karl Maria von Weber&#x27;s 1821 opera &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; and in Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; of 1911. César Franck&#x27;s orchestral tone poem &quot;Le Chasseur maudit&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Huntsman&quot;) is based on Gottfried August Bürger&#x27;s ballad &quot;Der wilde Jäger&quot;.

In act 1 of Richard Wagner&#x27;s 1870 opera &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, Siegmund relates that he has been pursued by “Das wütende Heer”, which is an indication to the audience that it is Wotan himself who has called up the storm which has driven him (Siegmund) to Hunding&#x27;s dwelling.

The subject of Stan Jones&#x27; American country song &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot; of 1948, which tells of cowboys chasing the Devil&#x27;s cattle through the night sky, resembles the European myth.

Swedish folk musician The Tallest Man on Earth released an album in 2010 entitled &quot;The Wild Hunt&quot;, and in 2013 the black metal band Watain, also Swedish, released an album with the same title. German folk band Versengold released the song &quot;Die wilde Jagt&quot; in 2021, as the first single from their 2022 album &quot;Was kost die Welt&quot;.

=== Comics ===
The Wild Hunt appears in Marvel Comics, primarily the &quot;Thor&quot; series, and is led by Malekith the Accursed, the Dark Elf King of Svartalfheim and one of Thor&#x27;s archenemies.

In Mike Mignola&#x27;s comic book series Hellboy, two versions of the Wild Hunt myth are present. In &quot;&quot;, the hero receives an invitation from British noblemen to partake in a giant hunting called &quot;The Wild Hunt&quot;, after the legend of &quot;Herne, god of the Hunt&quot;. In &quot;&quot;, Hellboy encounters &quot;King Vold, the flying huntsman&quot; whose figure is based on the Norwegian folktale of &quot;The Flying Huntsman (headless King Volmer and his hounds)&quot; according to Mignola.

The Wild Hunt was adapted for the Grace Note portion of &quot;The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II&quot; anime adaptation with the 4th and 5th episodes where Lord El-Melloi II (voiced by Daisuke Namikawa) helps a fellow magus teacher by the name of Wills Pelham Codrington (voiced by Tomoaki Maeno) in a case involving his father&#x27;s home where the leylines have become unstable. It is there they encounter Black Dogs, the incarnation of lightning who have been killing people in the vicinity. With the help of his allies, Wills, and a fairy they encounter names Faye, Lord El-Melloi II manages to solve the case and avert the threat.

=== Film and television ===
Episode 5 of the BBC series shown in 1958/9, Quatermass and the Pit, written by Nigel Neale, was entitled &quot;The Wild Hunt&quot; and made frequent mention of the myths described here.

&quot;The Wild Hunt&quot; is a Canadian horror drama film of 2009 by director Alexandre Franchi.

The MTV series &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; features the Wild Hunt as the main villains of the first half of season 6. It takes the legend a bit further, claiming that the Wild Hunt erases people from existence, and those taken by the Wild Hunt become members after they are erased and forgotten.

The Wild Hunt features heavily in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Little Witch Academia&quot; episode &quot;Sky War Stanship&quot;, in which the main protagonist Akko Kagari and Constanze Amalie Von Braunschbank Albrechtsberger partake in the hunt itself.

=== Literature ===
In J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, while traveling through Mirkwood, the dwarves and Bilbo encounter a deer running through the forest, which knocks Bombur into the enchanted river. After they pull him out, they hear far off the sound of a &quot;great hunt&quot; and the baying of dogs going past them.

In The Deluge (1886) by Henryk Sienkiewicz, the motif of the Wild Hunt appears, as a hellish procession of Teutonic knights rushing through the night sky, heralding war and extraordinary disasters.

The description of the Wild Hunt also appears in the drama Wesele (The Wedding), by Stanisław Wyspiański. It is described as a race of large knights across the night sky at great speed.

The hunt plays an important role in four of Jim Butcher&#x27;s Dresden Files novels: (2005 &quot;Dead Beat&quot;, 2006 &quot;Proven Guilty&quot;, 2012 &quot;Cold Days&quot; and 2020 &quot;Battle Ground&quot;), In Butcher&#x27;s cosmos, Santa Claus and Odin are the same being. He shares leadership of the hunt with the Elf King.

Αustralian writer Tim Winton&#x27;s &quot;The Riders (1994),&quot; which was shortlisted for the 1995 Booker Prize, mentions a vision of the Wild Hunt that becomes the basis for the main character&#x27;s own &#x27;wild hunt&#x27; of the story.

The Wild Hunt features in &quot;The Witcher&quot; series of fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski, published in English between 2007 and 2018.

The Wild Hunt also features as a fey phenomenon in Larry Correa&#x27;s &quot;Monster Hunter International&quot; series in Siege, published in 2017.

It also features in Cassandra Clare&#x27;s book series, The Mortal instruments (2007-2014) and &quot;The Dark Artifices (2016-2018)&quot;, led by Gwyn ap Nudd. The &quot;Wicked Lovely&quot; series (2007-2013) by Melissa Marr contains a modern Wild Hunt. It is also a major plot point in Peter S. Beagle&#x27;s &quot;Tamsin&quot;. The Wild Hunt is a primary element of R. S. Belcher&#x27;s novel &quot;The Brotherhood of the Wheel&quot; and Raymond E. Feist&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;Faerie Tale&quot;. The Wild Hunt is also an important plot point in the Gilded Duology by Marissa Meyer.
In Clive Barker&#x27;s novel &quot;Coldheart Canyon&quot;, the story is centered around a bizarre version of The Wild Hunt. Also in Sharyn McCrummb&#x27;s novel &quot;GhostRiders&quot;, The Wild Hunt is depicted by Civil War soldiers who are constantly reliving the war.

In Lucy Holland’s 2024 historical fantasy novel &quot;Song of the Huntress&quot;, the Wild Hunt appears with a gender-swapped version of mythical Britonic King Herla as its leader, who has been tricked into taking on that role by Gwyn ap Nudd, king of the Otherworld.

=== Games ===
The hunt is featured in CD Projekt Red&#x27;s 2015 role-playing video game &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot;, based on the books, after being referenced heavily during the events and flashbacks of &quot;The Witcher&quot; and &quot;The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings&quot;. It reveals to be an army of elven conquerors who seek to conquer the world of The Witcher in order to save themselves from a self-spreading spell known as the White Frost, which freezes the worlds and devastates them.

In the original Advanced &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1st Edition) expansion &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot; the Wild Hunt is represented under the Celtic Mythos sections as the Master of the Hunt and the Pack of the Wild Hunt. Players risk a chance of becoming the hunted, or may be compelled to join the Hunt and track down the source of the evil that summoned it, or if that evil isn&#x27;t found, participate in the slaughter of an innocent person or large game animal, potentially against their alignment and will.

In &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; series of role-playing video games, the Wild Hunt is a ritual performed by the Bosmer (wood elves) for war, vengeance, or other times of desperation. The elves are transformed into a horde of horrific creatures that kill all in their path. The Daedric Lord Hircine also performs a Wild Hunt ritual more similar to the wild hunt of folklore. This ritual was renamed to the &quot;Great hunt&quot; with the release of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

The Wild Hunt is heavily featured and elaborated on in the Obsidian Entertainment video game, Pentiment.

In Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla it was featured in the seasonal themed update &quot;Oskoreia Festival&quot;.

In Limbus Company, the Wild Hunt was featured in the third part of Canto/Chapter VI, consisting of many versions of Canto/Chapter VI side characters, being led by an alternative version of one of the playable characters, Erlkönig Heathcliff.

<text>Electrical discharge machining (EDM), also known as spark machining, spark eroding, die sinking, wire burning or wire erosion, is a metal
fabrication process whereby a desired shape is obtained by using electrical discharges (sparks). Material is removed from the work piece by a series of rapidly recurring current discharges between two electrodes, separated by a dielectric liquid and subject to an electric voltage. One of the electrodes is called the tool-electrode, or simply the or , while the other is called the workpiece-electrode, or . The process depends upon the tool and work piece not making physical contact. Extremely hard materials like carbides, ceramics, titanium alloys and heat treated tool steels that are very difficult to machine using conventional machining can be precisely machined by EDM.

When the voltage between the two electrodes is increased, the intensity of the electric field in the volume between the electrodes becomes greater, causing dielectric break down of the liquid, and produces an electric arc. As a result, material is removed from the electrodes. Once the current stops (or is stopped, depending on the type of generator), new liquid dielectric is conveyed into the inter-electrode volume, enabling the solid particles (debris) to be carried away and the insulating properties of the dielectric to be restored. Adding new liquid dielectric in the inter-electrode volume is commonly referred to as . After a current flow, the voltage between the electrodes is restored to what it was before the breakdown, so that a new liquid dielectric breakdown can occur to repeat the cycle.

==History==
The erosive effect of electrical discharges was first noted in 1770 by English physicist Joseph Priestley.

===Die-sink EDM===
Two Soviet scientists, B. R. Lazarenko and N. I. Lazarenko, were tasked in 1943 to investigate ways of preventing the erosion of tungsten electrical contacts due to sparking. They failed in this task but found that the erosion was more precisely controlled if the electrodes were immersed in a dielectric fluid. This led them to invent an EDM machine used for working difficult-to-machine materials such as tungsten. The Lazarenkos&#x27; machine is known as an R-C-type machine, after the resistor–capacitor circuit (RC circuit) used to charge the electrodes.

Simultaneously but independently, an American team, Harold Stark, Victor Harding, and Jack Beaver, developed an EDM machine for removing broken drills and taps from aluminium castings. Initially constructing their machines from under-powered electric-etching tools, they were not very successful. But more powerful sparking units, combined with automatic spark repetition and fluid replacement with an electromagnetic interrupter arrangement produced practical machines. Stark, Harding, and Beaver&#x27;s machines produced 60 sparks per second. Later machines based on their design used vacuum tube circuits that produced thousands of sparks per second, significantly increasing the speed of cutting.
===Wire-cut EDM===

The wire-cut type of machine arose in the 1960s for making tools (dies) from hardened steel. The tool electrode in wire EDM is simply a wire. To avoid the erosion of the wire causing it to break, the wire is wound between two spools so that the active part of the wire is constantly changing. The earliest numerical controlled (NC) machines were conversions of punched-tape vertical milling machines. The first commercially available NC machine built as a wire-cut EDM machine was manufactured in the USSR in 1967. Machines that could optically follow lines on a master drawing were developed by David H. Dulebohn&#x27;s group in the 1960s at Andrew Engineering Company for milling and grinding machines. Master drawings were later produced by computer numerical controlled (CNC) plotters for greater accuracy. A wire-cut EDM machine using the CNC drawing plotter and optical line follower techniques was produced in 1974. Dulebohn later used the same plotter CNC program to directly control the EDM machine, and the first CNC EDM machine was produced in 1976.

Commercial wire EDM capability and use has advanced substantially during recent decades. Feed rates have increased and surface finish can be finely controlled.

==Generalities==

Electrical discharge machining is a machining method primarily used for hard metals or those that would be very difficult to machine with traditional techniques. EDM typically works with materials that are electrically conductive, although methods have also been proposed for using EDM to machine insulating ceramics. EDM can cut intricate contours or cavities in pre-hardened steel without the need for heat treatment to soften and re-harden them. This method can be used with any other metal or metal alloy such as titanium, hastelloy, kovar, and inconel. Also, applications of this process to shape polycrystalline diamond tools have been reported.

EDM is often included in the &quot;non-traditional&quot; or &quot;non-conventional&quot; group of machining methods together with processes such as electrochemical machining (ECM), water jet cutting (WJ, AWJ), laser cutting, and opposite to the &quot;conventional&quot; group (turning, milling, grinding, drilling, and any other process whose material removal mechanism is essentially based on mechanical forces).

Ideally, EDM can be seen as a series of breakdown and restoration of the liquid dielectric in-between the electrodes. However, caution should be exerted in considering such a statement because it is an idealized model of the process, introduced to describe the fundamental ideas underlying the process. Yet, any practical application involves many aspects that may also need to be considered. For instance, the removal of the debris from the inter-electrode volume is likely to be always partial. Thus the electrical properties of the dielectric in the inter-electrodes volume can be different from their nominal values and can even vary with time. The inter-electrode distance, often also referred to as spark-gap, is the result of the control algorithms of the specific machine used. The control of such a distance appears logically to be central to this process. Also, not all of the current between the dielectric is of the ideal type described above: the spark-gap can be short-circuited by the debris. The control system of the electrode may fail to react quickly enough to prevent the two electrodes (tool and workpiece) from coming into contact, with a consequent short circuit. This is unwanted because a short circuit contributes to material removal differently from the ideal case. The flushing action can be inadequate to restore the insulating properties of the dielectric so that the current always happens in the point of the inter-electrode volume (this is referred to as arcing), with a consequent unwanted change of shape (damage) of the tool-electrode and workpiece. Ultimately, a description of this process in a suitable way for the specific purpose at hand is what makes the EDM area such a rich field for further investigation and research.

To obtain a specific geometry, the EDM tool is guided along the desired path very close to the work; ideally it should not touch the workpiece, although in reality this may happen due to the performance of the specific motion control in use. In this way, a large number of current discharges (colloquially also called sparks) happen, each contributing to the removal of material from both tool and workpiece, where small craters are formed. The size of the craters is a function of the technological parameters set for the specific job at hand. They can be with typical dimensions ranging from the nanoscale (in micro-EDM operations) to some hundreds of micrometers in roughing conditions.

The presence of these small craters on the tool results in the gradual erosion of the electrode. This erosion of the tool-electrode is also referred to as wear. Strategies are needed to counteract the detrimental effect of the wear on the geometry of the workpiece. One possibility is that of continuously replacing the tool-electrode during a machining operation. This is what happens if a continuously replaced wire is used as electrode. In this case, the correspondent EDM process is also called wire EDM. The tool-electrode can also be used in such a way that only a small portion of it is actually engaged in the machining process and this portion is changed on a regular basis. This is, for instance, the case when using a rotating disk as a tool-electrode. The corresponding process is often also referred to as EDM grinding.

A further strategy consists in using a set of electrodes with different sizes and shapes during the same EDM operation. This is often referred to as multiple electrode strategy, and is most common when the tool electrode replicates in negative the wanted shape and is advanced towards the blank along a single direction, usually the vertical direction (i.e. z-axis). This resembles the sink of the tool into the dielectric liquid in which the workpiece is immersed, so, not surprisingly, it is often referred to as die-sinking EDM (also called conventional EDM and ram EDM). The corresponding machines are often called sinker EDM. Usually, the electrodes of this type have quite complex forms. If the final geometry is obtained using a usually simple-shaped electrode which is moved along several directions and is possibly also subject to rotations, often the term EDM milling is used.

In any case, the severity of the wear is strictly dependent on the technological parameters used in the operation (for instance: polarity, maximum current, open circuit voltage). For example, in micro-EDM, also known as μ-EDM, these parameters are usually set at values which generates severe wear. Therefore, wear is a major problem in that area.

The problem of wear to graphite electrodes is being addressed. In one approach, a digital generator, controllable within milliseconds, reverses polarity as electro-erosion takes place. That produces an effect similar to electroplating that continuously deposits the eroded graphite back on the electrode. In another method, a so-called &quot;Zero Wear&quot; circuit reduces how often the discharge starts and stops, keeping it on for as long a time as possible.

==Definition of the technological parameters==
Difficulties have been encountered in the definition of the technological parameters that drive the process.

Two broad categories of generators, also known as power supplies, are in use on EDM machines commercially available: the group based on RC circuits and the group based on transistor-controlled pulses.

In both categories, the primary parameters at setup are the current and frequency delivered. In RC circuits, however, little control is expected over the time duration of the discharge, which is likely to depend on the actual spark-gap conditions (size and pollution) at the moment of the discharge. Also, the open circuit voltage (i.e. the voltage between the electrodes when the dielectric is not yet broken) can be identified as steady state voltage of the RC circuit.

In generators based on transistor control, the user is usually able to deliver a train of pulses of voltage to the electrodes. Each pulse can be controlled in shape, for instance, quasi-rectangular. In particular, the time between two consecutive pulses and the duration of each pulse can be set. The amplitude of each pulse constitutes the open circuit voltage. Thus, the maximum duration of discharge is equal to the duration of a pulse of voltage in the train. Two pulses of current are then expected not to occur for a duration equal or larger than the time interval between two consecutive pulses of voltage.

The maximum current during a discharge that the generator delivers can also be controlled. Because other sorts of generators may also be used by different machine builders, the parameters that may actually be set on a particular machine will depend on the generator manufacturer. The details of the generators and control systems on their machines are not always easily available to their user. This is a barrier to describing unequivocally the technological parameters of the EDM process. Moreover, the parameters affecting the phenomena occurring between tool and electrode are also related to the controller of the motion of the electrodes.

A framework to define and measure the electrical parameters during an EDM operation directly on inter-electrode volume with an oscilloscope external to the machine has been recently proposed by Ferri &quot;et al.&quot; These authors conducted their research in the field of μ-EDM, but the same approach can be used in any EDM operation. This would enable the user to estimate directly the electrical parameters that affect their operations without relying upon machine manufacturer&#x27;s claims. When machining different materials in the same setup conditions, the actual electrical parameters of the process are significantly different.

==Material removal mechanism==
The first serious attempt at providing a physical explanation of the material removal during electric discharge machining is perhaps that of Van Dijck. Van Dijck presented a thermal model together with a computational simulation to explain the phenomena between the electrodes during electric discharge machining. However, as Van Dijck himself admitted in his study, the number of assumptions made to overcome the lack of experimental data at that time was quite significant.

Further models of what occurs during electric discharge machining in terms of heat transfer were developed in the late eighties and early nineties. It resulted in three scholarly papers: the first presenting a thermal model of material removal on the cathode, the second presenting a thermal model for the erosion occurring on the anode and the third introducing a model describing the plasma channel formed during the passage of the discharge current through the dielectric liquid. Validation of these models is supported by experimental data provided by AGIE.

These models give the most authoritative support for the claim that EDM is a thermal process, removing material from the two electrodes because of melting or vaporization, along with pressure dynamics established in the spark-gap by the collapsing of the plasma channel. However, for small discharge energies the models are inadequate to explain the experimental data. All these models hinge on a number of assumptions from such disparate research areas as submarine explosions, discharges in gases, and failure of transformers, so it is not surprising that alternative models have been proposed more recently in the literature trying to explain the EDM process.

Among these, the model from Singh and Ghosh reconnects the removal of material from the electrode to the presence of an electrical force on the surface of the electrode that could mechanically remove material and create the craters. This would be possible because the material on the surface has altered mechanical properties due to an increased temperature caused by the passage of electric current. The authors&#x27; simulations showed how they might explain EDM better than a thermal model (melting or evaporation), especially for small discharge energies, which are typically used in μ-EDM and in finishing operations.

Given the many available models, it appears that the material removal mechanism in EDM is not yet well understood and that further investigation is necessary to clarify it, especially considering the lack of experimental scientific evidence to build and validate the current EDM models. This explains an increased current research effort in related experimental techniques.

==Types==

===Sinker EDM===

Sinker EDM, also called ram EDM, cavity type EDM or volume EDM, consists of an electrode and workpiece submerged in an insulating liquid such as, more typically, oil or, less frequently, other dielectric fluids. The electrode and workpiece are connected to a suitable power supply. The power supply generates an electrical potential between the two parts. As the electrode approaches the workpiece, dielectric breakdown occurs in the fluid, forming a plasma channel, and a small spark jumps.

These sparks usually strike one at a time, because it is very unlikely that different locations in the inter-electrode space have the identical local electrical characteristics which would enable a spark to occur simultaneously in all such locations. These sparks happen in huge numbers at seemingly random locations between the electrode and the workpiece. As the base metal is eroded, and the spark gap subsequently increased, the electrode is lowered automatically by the machine so that the process can continue uninterrupted. Several hundred thousand sparks occur per second, with the actual duty cycle carefully controlled by the setup parameters. These controlling cycles are sometimes known as &quot;on time&quot; and &quot;off time&quot;, which are more formally defined in the literature.

The on time setting determines the length or duration of the spark. Hence, a longer on time produces a deeper cavity from each spark, creating a rougher finish on the workpiece. The reverse is true for a shorter on time. Off time is the period of time between sparks. Although not directly affecting the machining of the part, the off time allows the flushing of dielectric fluid through a nozzle to clean out the eroded debris. Insufficient debris removal can cause repeated strikes in the same location which can lead to a short circuit. Modern controllers monitor the characteristics of the arcs and can alter parameters in microseconds to compensate. The typical part geometry is a complex 3D shape, often with small or odd shaped angles. Vertical, orbital, vectorial, directional, helical, conical, rotational, spin, and indexing machining cycles are also used.

===Wire EDM===

In &quot;wire electrical discharge machining&quot; (WEDM), also known as &quot;wire-cut EDM&quot; and &quot;wire cutting&quot;, a thin single-strand metal wire, usually brass, is fed through the workpiece, submerged in a tank of dielectric fluid, typically deionized water. Wire-cut EDM is typically used to cut plates as thick as and to make punches, tools, and dies from hard metals that are difficult to machine with other methods.

The wire, which is constantly fed from a spool, is held between upper and lower diamond guides which is centered in a water nozzle head. The guides, usually CNC-controlled, move in the &quot;x&quot;–&quot;y&quot; plane. On most machines, the upper guide can also move independently in the &quot;z&quot;–&quot;u&quot;–&quot;v&quot; axis, giving rise to the ability to cut tapered and transitioning shapes (circle on the bottom, square at the top for example). The upper guide can control axis movements in the GCode standard, &quot;x&quot;–&quot;y&quot;–&quot;u&quot;–&quot;v&quot;–&quot;i&quot;–&quot;j&quot;–&quot;k&quot;–&quot;l&quot;–. This allows the wire-cut EDM to be programmed to cut very intricate and delicate shapes.

The upper and lower diamond guides are usually accurate to , and can have a cutting path or &quot;kerf&quot; as small as using Ø wire, though the average cutting kerf that achieves the best economic cost and machining time is using Ø brass wire. The reason that the cutting width is greater than the width of the wire is because sparking occurs from the sides of the wire to the work piece, causing erosion. This &quot;overcut&quot; is necessary, for many applications it is adequately predictable and therefore can be compensated for (for instance in micro-EDM this is not often the case). Spools of wire are long — an spool of wire is just over in length. Wire diameter can be as small as and the geometry precision is not far from ± .

The wire-cut process uses water as its dielectric fluid, controlling its resistivity and other electrical properties with filters and PID controlled de-ionizer units. The water flushes the cut debris away from the cutting zone. Flushing is an important factor in determining the maximum feed rate for a given material thickness.

Along with tighter tolerances, multi axis EDM wire-cutting machining centers have added features such as multi heads for cutting two parts at the same time, controls for preventing wire breakage, automatic self-threading features in case of wire breakage, and programmable machining strategies to optimize the operation.

Wire-cutting EDM is commonly used when low residual stresses are desired, because it does not require high cutting forces for removal of material. If the energy per pulse is relatively low (as in finishing operations), little change in the mechanical properties of a material is expected due to these low residual stresses, although material that hasn&#x27;t been stress-relieved can distort in the machining process.

The work piece may undergo a significant thermal cycle, its severity depending on the technological parameters used. Such thermal cycles may cause formation of a recast layer on the part and residual tensile stresses on the work piece. If machining takes place after heat treatment, dimensional accuracy will not be affected by heat treat distortion.

===Fast hole drilling EDM===
Fast hole drilling EDM was designed for producing fast, accurate, small, deep holes. It is conceptually akin to sinker EDM but the electrode is a rotating tube conveying a pressurized jet of dielectric fluid. It can make a hole an inch deep in about a minute and is a good way to machine holes in materials too hard for twist-drill machining. This EDM drilling type is used largely in the aerospace industry, producing cooling holes into aero blades and other components. It is also used to drill holes in industrial gas turbine blades, in molds and dies, and in bearings.

==Applications==
===Prototype production===
The EDM process is most widely used by the mold-making, tool, and die industries, but is becoming a common method of making prototype and production parts, especially in the aerospace, automobile and electronics industries in which production quantities are relatively low. In sinker EDM, a graphite, copper tungsten, or pure copper electrode is machined into the desired (negative) shape and fed into the workpiece on the end of a vertical ram.

===Coinage die making===

For the creation of dies for producing jewelry and badges, or blanking and piercing (through use of a pancake die) by the coinage (stamping) process, the positive master may be made from sterling silver, since (with appropriate machine settings) the master is significantly eroded and is used only once. The resultant negative die is then hardened and used in a drop hammer to produce stamped flats from cutout sheet blanks of bronze, silver, or low proof gold alloy. For badges these flats may be further shaped to a curved surface by another die. This type of EDM is usually performed submerged in an oil-based dielectric. The finished object may be further refined by hard (glass) or soft (paint) enameling, or electroplated with pure gold or nickel. Softer materials such as silver may be hand engraved as a refinement.


===Small hole drilling===

Small hole drilling EDM is used in a variety of applications.

On wire-cut EDM machines, small hole drilling EDM is used to make a through hole in a workpiece through which to thread the wire for the wire-cut EDM operation. A separate EDM head specifically for small hole drilling is mounted on a wire-cut machine and allows large hardened plates to have finished parts eroded from them as needed and without pre-drilling.

Small hole EDM is used to drill rows of holes into the leading and trailing edges of turbine blades used in jet engines. Gas flow through these small holes allows the engines to use higher temperatures than otherwise possible. The high-temperature, very hard, single crystal alloys employed in these blades makes conventional machining of these holes with high aspect ratio extremely difficult, if not impossible.

Small hole EDM is also used to create microscopic orifices for fuel system components, spinnerets for synthetic fibers such as rayon, and other applications.

There are also stand-alone small hole drilling EDM machines with an &quot;x&quot;–&quot;y&quot; axis also known as a super drill or &quot;hole popper&quot; that can machine blind or through holes. EDM drills bore holes with a long brass or copper tube electrode that rotates in a chuck with a constant flow of distilled or deionized water flowing through the electrode as a flushing agent and dielectric. The electrode tubes operate like the wire in wire-cut EDM machines, having a spark gap and wear rate. Some small-hole drilling EDMs are able to drill through of soft or hardened steel in less than 10 seconds, averaging 50% to 80% wear rate. Holes of can be achieved in this drilling operation. Brass electrodes are easier to machine but are not recommended for wire-cut operations due to eroded brass particles causing &quot;brass on brass&quot; wire breakage, therefore copper is recommended.

===Metal disintegration machining===
Several manufacturers produce EDM machines for the specific purpose of removing broken cutting tools and fasteners from work pieces. In this application, the process is termed &quot;metal disintegration machining&quot; or MDM. The metal disintegration process removes only the center of the broken tool or fastener, leaving the hole intact and allowing a ruined part to be reclaimed.

===Closed-loop manufacturing===
Closed-loop manufacturing can improve the accuracy and reduce the tool costs

==Advantages and disadvantages==
EDM is often compared to electrochemical machining.
Advantages of EDM include:
*Ability to machine complex shapes that would otherwise be difficult to produce with conventional cutting tools.
*Machining of extremely hard material to very close tolerances.
*Very small work pieces can be machined where conventional cutting tools may damage the part from excess cutting tool pressure.
*There is no direct contact between tool and work piece. Therefore, delicate sections and weak materials can be machined without perceivable distortion.
*A good surface finish can be obtained; a very good surface may be obtained by redundant finishing paths.
*Very fine holes can be attained.
*Tapered holes may be produced.
*Pipe or container internal contours and internal corners down to R 0.001&quot;.

Disadvantages of EDM include:
*Difficulty finding expert machinists.
*The slow rate of material removal.
*Potential fire hazard associated with use of combustible oil based dielectrics.
*The additional time and cost used for creating electrodes for ram/sinker EDM.
*Reproducing sharp corners on the workpiece is difficult due to electrode wear.
*Specific power consumption is very high.
*Power consumption is high.
*&quot;Overcut&quot; is formed.
*Excessive tool wear occurs during machining.
*Electrically non-conductive materials can be machined only with specific set-up of the process.
*A recast layer is formed at the cut surface due to melting of the material by the arc.

<text>Project planning is part of project management, which relates to the use of schedules such as Gantt charts to plan and subsequently report progress within the project environment. Project planning can be done manually or by the use of project management software.

== Description ==

Initially, the project scope is defined and the appropriate methods for completing the project are determined. Following this step, the durations for the various tasks necessary to complete the work are listed and grouped into a work breakdown structure. Project planning is often used to organize different areas of a project, including project plans, workloads and the management of teams and individuals. The logical dependencies between tasks are defined using an activity network diagram that enables identification of the critical path. Project planning is inherently uncertain as it must be done before the project is actually started. Therefore, the duration of the tasks is often estimated through a weighted average of optimistic, normal, and pessimistic cases. The critical chain method adds &quot;buffers&quot; in the planning to anticipate potential delays in project execution. Float or slack time in the schedule can be calculated using project management software. Then the necessary resources can be estimated and costs for each activity can be allocated to each resource, giving the total project cost. At this stage, the project schedule may be optimized to achieve the appropriate balance between resource usage and project duration to comply with the project objectives. Once established and agreed, the project schedule becomes what is known as the baseline schedule. Progress will be measured against the baseline schedule throughout the life of the project. Analyzing progress compared to the baseline schedule is known as earned value management.

The inputs of the project planning phase 2 include the project charter and the concept proposal. The outputs of the project planning phase include the project requirements, the project schedule, and the project management plan.

<text>Porridge is a food made by heating or boiling ground, crushed or chopped starchy plants, typically grain, in milk or water. It is often cooked or served with added flavourings such as sugar, honey, fruit, or syrup to make a sweet cereal, or it can be mixed with spices, meat, or vegetables to make a savoury dish. It is usually served hot in a bowl, depending on its consistency. Oat porridge, or oatmeal, is one of the most common types of porridge. Gruel is a thinner version of porridge and congee is a savoury variation of porridge of Asian origin.

==Type of grains==

The term &quot;porridge&quot; is used in British English (Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand) specifically for oatmeal. This is a hot mixture of oatmeal or oats slowly cooked with water or milk. It is typically eaten for breakfast by itself or with other ingredients, including salt, sugar, fruit, milk, cream, or butter.

Other grains used for porridge include rice, wheat (cracked wheat porridge is also known as frumenty), barley, corn, triticale and buckwheat. Many types of porridge have their own names, such as congee (rice), polenta (maize) and poi (from taro).

==Conventional uses==
Porridge can be eaten for any meal of the day. Porridge is eaten in many cultures around the world as a common snack or as breakfast, lunch or dinner. 

==Nutrition==
Unenriched porridge (as oatmeal), cooked by boiling or microwave, is 84% water, and contains 12% carbohydrates, including 2% dietary fiber and 2% each of protein and fat (table). In a reference amount, cooked porridge provides 71 calories and contains 26% of the Daily Value (DV) for manganese, with no other micronutrients in significant content (table).

===Health effect===
A 2014 review found that daily intake of at least 3 grams of oat beta-glucan lowers total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 5–10% in people with normal or elevated blood cholesterol levels. Beta-glucan lowers cholesterol by inhibiting cholesterol production, although cholesterol reduction is greater in people with higher total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in their blood. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration issued a final ruling in 2015 stating that food companies can make health claims on food labels for products containing soluble fiber from whole oats (oat bran, oat flour and rolled oats), noting that 3.0 grams of soluble fiber daily from these foods may reduce the risk of heart disease. To qualify for the health claim, the food that contains the oats must provide at least 0.75 grams of soluble fiber per serving.

====Types of oats====

Oats for porridge may be whole (groats), cut into two or three pieces (called &quot;pinhead&quot;, &quot;steel-cut&quot; or &quot;coarse&quot; oatmeal), ground into medium or fine oatmeal or steamed and rolled into flakes of varying sizes and thicknesses (called &quot;rolled oats&quot;, the largest size being &quot;jumbo&quot;). The larger the pieces of oat used, the more textured the resulting porridge. It is said that, because of their size and shape, the body breaks steel-cut oats down more slowly than rolled oats, reducing spikes in blood sugar and making the eater feel full longer. The US &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; website found that the more cooking required, the stronger the oat flavor and the less mushy the texture.

Oats are a good source of dietary fibre; health benefits are claimed for oat bran in particular, which is part of the grain.

====Preparation====
The oats are cooked in milk, water or a mixture of the two. Scottish traditionalists allow only oats, water and salt. There are techniques suggested by cooks, such as presoaking, but a comparative test found little difference in the end result. Various flavourings can be used and may vary widely by taste and locality. Demerara sugar, golden syrup, Greek yoghurt and honey are common. Cold milk or single cream may be used.

==History==

Historically, porridge was a staple food in much of the world, including Europe, Africa and Asia, and it remains a staple food in many parts of the world, it becoming commonplace in agricultural societies that practice grain cultivation starting from the Neolithic period and onward. The dish has traditionally been closely associated with Scotland, possibly because oats can be successfully cultivated on marginal upland soils. In 1775, Dr. Samuel Johnson wrote that oats were &quot;a grain which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people&quot;. Oats were introduced to Scotland in about 600 AD; traces of barley porridge have been found in pots excavated in the Outer Hebrides which have been dated to 2,500 years ago.

===Northern Europe===
Historically, porridge was a staple food in much of Northern Europe and Russia. It was often made from barley, though other grains and yellow peas could be used, depending on local conditions. It was primarily a savoury dish, with meats, root crops, vegetables and herbs added for flavor. Porridge could be cooked in a large metal kettle over hot coals or heated in a cheaper earthenware container by adding hot stones until boiling hot. Until leavened bread and baking ovens became commonplace in Europe, porridge was a typical means of preparing cereal crops for the table.

Porridge was also commonly provided for breakfast for inmates in the British prison system during the 19th century and early 20th century, and so &quot;doing porridge&quot; became a slang term for a sentence in prison.

<doc id="75525" wikidata="Q2917190" url="?curid=75525" title="Eleanor cross">
<text>The Eleanor crosses were a series of twelve tall and lavishly decorated stone monuments topped with crosses erected in a line down part of the east of England. King Edward I had them built between 1291 and about 1295 in memory of his wife Eleanor of Castile. The King and Queen had been married for 36 years and she stayed by the King&#x27;s side through his many travels. While on a royal progress, she died in the East Midlands in November 1290. The crosses, erected in her memory, marked the nightly resting-places along the route taken when her body was transported to Westminster Abbey near London.

The crosses stood at Lincoln, Grantham and Stamford, all in Lincolnshire; Geddington and Hardingstone in Northamptonshire; Stony Stratford in Buckinghamshire; Woburn and Dunstable in Bedfordshire; St Albans and Waltham (now Waltham Cross) in Hertfordshire; Cheapside in London; and Charing (now Charing Cross) in Westminster.

Three of the medieval monuments – those at Geddington, Hardingstone and Waltham Cross – survive more or less intact; but the other nine, other than a few fragments, are lost. Some were destroyed during the Reformation and Civil War, due to their Catholic associations. The largest and most ornate of the twelve was the Charing Cross. Several memorials and elaborated reproductions of the crosses have been erected, including the Queen Eleanor Memorial Cross at Charing Cross Station (built 1865), northeastalong the Strand roadwayof the original site of the Charing Cross.

Edward I&#x27;s use of architecture is known for containing an element of propaganda. In her lifetime, Eleanor had been unpopular with the public, particularly for her acquisitiveness regarding land holdings, which had been associated with the abuse of Jewish loans, attracting strong criticism from the church. The series of Crosses played a role in rehabilitating Eleanor&#x27;s image as an idealised Queen and woman, as well as projecting royal and spiritual power. The Lincoln tomb of a child falsely claimed to be martyred by Jews is widely assumed to form part of the series, positioning Eleanor and Edward as defenders against the recently expelled Jews. The series has architectural parallels, most notably the 1271 &quot;montjoies&quot; marking the funeral route of King Louis IX of France, which were designed as part of an attempt to promote his canonisation as a saint.

==Background==

===Procession and burials===
Eleanor of Castile died on 28 November 1290 at Harby, Nottinghamshire. Edward and Eleanor loved each other and much like his father, Edward was very devoted to his wife and remained faithful to her throughout their married lives. He was deeply affected by her death and displayed his grief by erecting twelve so-called Eleanor crosses, one at each place where her funeral cortège stopped for the night.

Following her death the body of Queen Eleanor was carried to Lincoln, about away, where she was embalmed – probably either at the Gilbertine priory of St Katherine in the south of the city, or at the priory of the Dominicans. Her viscera, with the exception of her heart, were buried in the Angel Choir of Lincoln Cathedral on 3 December. Eleanor&#x27;s other remains were carried to London, a journey of about , that lasted 12 days. Her body was buried in Westminster Abbey, at the feet of her father-in-law King Henry III on 17 December; while her heart was buried in the church of the London Dominicans&#x27; priory at Blackfriars (a house that she and Edward had heavily patronised) on 19 December, along with those of her young son Alphonso, Earl of Chester, who had died in 1284, and of John de Vesci, who had died in 1289.

===Purpose and parallels===
Eleanor&#x27;s crosses appear to have been intended in part as expressions of royal power; and in part as cenotaphs to encourage prayers for her soul from travellers. On the pedestal of each was inscribed the phrase &quot;Orate pro anima&quot; (&quot;Pray for [her] soul&quot;). Eleanor&#x27;s reputation had been tarnished by her trafficking in Jewish loans and land acquisition in her own lifetime. Favourable mentions in contemporary chronicles do not emerge until the succession of her son.The Crosses have been an important element in forming her reputation as an idealised Queen, focusing attention on her relationship with Edward.

It was not unknown for memorial crosses to be constructed in the middle ages, although they were normally isolated instances and relatively simple in design. A cross in the Strand, near London, was said to have been erected by William II in memory of his mother, Queen Matilda (d. 1083). Henry III erected one at Merton, Surrey, for his cousin the Earl of Surrey (d. 1240). Another was erected at Reading for Edward I&#x27;s sister Beatrice (d. 1275). Yet another, almost contemporary with the Eleanor crosses, was erected near Windsor for Edward&#x27;s mother, Eleanor of Provence (d.1291).

The closest precedent for the Eleanor crosses, and almost certainly their model, was the series of nine crosses known as &quot;montjoies&quot; erected along the funeral route of King Louis IX of France in 1271. These were elaborate structures incorporating sculptural representations of the King, and were erected in part to promote his canonisation (a campaign that in 1297 succeeded). Eleanor&#x27;s crosses never aspired to this last purpose, but in design were even larger and more ornate than the &quot;montjoies&quot;, being of at least three rather than two tiers.

Eleanor has subsequently been an unclear and contested figure in English history. Since her death, she has been portrayed in both positive and negative lights, with romantic and aggressive portrayals, focusing on her relationship with Edward or her role as a Spanish, foreign monarch.

===Commemoration===
====Tomb monuments====
Both the burial of Eleanor&#x27;s body at Westminster and her visceral burial at Lincoln were subsequently marked by ornate effigial monuments, both with similar life-sized gilt bronze effigies cast by the goldsmith William Torell. Her heart burial at the Blackfriars was marked by another elaborate monument, but probably not with a life-sized effigy. The Blackfriars monument was lost following the priory&#x27;s dissolution in 1538. The Lincoln monument was destroyed in the 17th century, but was replaced in 1891 with a reconstruction, not on the site of the original. The Westminster Abbey monument survives.

====Form and content of the Crosses====
The twelve crosses were erected to mark the places where Eleanor&#x27;s funeral procession had stopped overnight. They take three part form, with the royal arms in the lower part, and statues of Eleanor above. In these, her crowned head is bowed, and she holds a sceptre. Her posture draws on Marian imagery to suggest grace and submission, and the imagery echoes that of her tombs. According to historian Paul Binski, their &quot;elaborate display&quot; conveys power as part of an authoritarian project; her statues&#x27; gaze should be interpreted as active, gazing out from a protected height onto her territory. They had a function that was both spiritual and temporal, binding localities with the source of power on earth, at Westminster.
=====Construction of the crosses=====
Their construction is documented in the executors&#x27; account rolls, which survive from 1291 to March 1294, but not thereafter. By the end of that period, the crosses at Lincoln, Hardingstone, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Albans and Waltham were complete or nearly so, and those at Cheapside and Charing in progress; but those at Grantham, Stamford and Geddington apparently not yet begun. It is assumed that these last three were erected in 1294 or 1295, and that they were certainly finished before the financial crisis of 1297 which brought a halt to royal building works. A number of artists worked on the crosses, as the account rolls show, with a distinction generally drawn between the main structures, made locally under the direction of master masons appointed by the King, and the statues of Eleanor, made of Caen stone, and other sculptural details, brought from London. Master masons included Richard of Crundale, Roger of Crundale (probably Richard&#x27;s brother), Michael of Canterbury, Richard of Stow, John of Battle and Nicholas Dymenge. Sculptors included Alexander of Abingdon and William of Ireland, both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, who were paid £3 6s. 8d. apiece for the statues; and Ralph of Chichester.

====Shrine of Little St Hugh====
The tomb of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln was rebuilt around the same time, probably by the same crafstmen and designers as the Eleanor crosses. It featured the royal arms, and decoration commemorating Eleanor. David Stocker believes that the shrine &quot;displays such close acquaintance with the Eleanor crosses that it has to be considered alongside them.&quot;

The cult of Little St Hugh venerated a false ritual murder allegation against the Jewish community of Lincoln, and was revived after the Expulsion of the Jews in 1290. Eleanor had been widely disliked for large-scale purchase of Jewish bonds, with the aim of requisitioning the lands and properties of those indebted. It has been suggested that the proximity of the shrine&#x27;s design to the Eleanor crosses was deliberate, in order to position Edward and Eleanor as protectors of Christians against supposed Jewish criminality. According to historian Joe Hillaby, the crosses and tomb amounted to a &quot;propaganda coup&quot;.

==Destruction, restoration and the Gothic revival==
The crosses suffered greatly during the Reformation and the English Civil Wars, as they represented a Catholic worldview, of public iconography.

Interest in English Gothic styles of architecture grew around the start of the Industrial Revolution. This coincided with a revival of interest in Eleanor as an idealised Queen. The design and form of the Eleanor Crosses was used to create new memorials, including commemorations of highly Protestant themes, while a number of the original Crosses including Charing Cross were recreated.

==Locations==
===Lincoln===
Eleanor rested on the first night of the journey at the Priory of Saint Katherine without Lincoln and her viscera were buried in Lincoln Cathedral on 3 December 1290. The Lincoln cross was built between 1291 and 1293 by Richard of Stow at a total recorded cost of over £120, with sculptures by William of Ireland (also named as William &quot;&quot;, or image-maker). John Leland, in the early 1540s, noted that &quot;a litle without Barre [gate] is a very fair crosse and large&quot;. It stood at Swine Green, St Catherine&#x27;s, an area just outside the city at the southern end of the High Street, but had disappeared by the early 18th century. The only surviving piece is the lower half of one of the statues, rediscovered in the 19th century and now in the grounds of Lincoln Castle.

===Grantham===
Eleanor&#x27;s bier spent the night of 4 December 1290 in Grantham, Lincolnshire. The master mason for the cross here is not known: it was probably constructed in 1294 or 1295. It stood at the upper end of the High Street. It was pulled down during the Civil War, but in February 1647 Grantham Corporation ordered that any stones that could be traced should be recovered for public use. No part is known to survive, but it is conceivable that the substantial steps of the standing Market Cross comprise stones that originally belonged to the Eleanor Cross. A letter from the 18th-century antiquary William Stukeley (now untraceable) is alleged to have stated that he had one of the lions from Eleanor&#x27;s coats of arms in his garden.

A modern relief stone plaque to Eleanor was installed at the Grantham Guildhall in 2015.

===Stamford===

Eleanor&#x27;s bier spent the night of 5 December 1290, and possibly also that of 6 December, in Stamford, Lincolnshire. The master mason for the cross here is not known: it was probably constructed in 1294 or 1295. There is conflicting evidence about its precise location, but it is now generally agreed that it stood just outside the town on the Great North Road (modern Casterton Road, the B1081), in what is today the Foxdale area.

The cross was in decay by the early 17th century, and in 1621 the town council ordered some restoration work, although it is unknown whether this was carried out. Richard Symonds reported in 1645: &quot;In the hill before ye come into the towne, stands a lofty large crosse built by Edward III, in memory of Elianor his queene, whose corps rested there coming from the North.&quot; In 1646 Richard Butcher, the Town Clerk, described it as &quot;so defaced, that only the Ruins appeare to my eye&quot;. It had probably been destroyed by 1659, and certainly by the early 18th century.

In 1745, William Stukeley attempted to excavate the remains of the cross, and succeeded in finding its hexagonal base and recovering several fragments of the superstructure. His sketch of the top portion, which seems to have stylistically resembled the Geddington Cross, is found in his diaries in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. A single small fragment from among Stukeley&#x27;s finds, a carved Purbeck marble rose, was rediscovered in about 1976, and identified as part of the cross in 1993. Following the closure of Stamford Museum in 2011, this fragment is now displayed in the Discover Stamford area at the town&#x27;s library.

A modern monument was erected in Stamford in 2009 in commemoration of Eleanor: see Replicas and imitations below.

===Geddington===
Eleanor&#x27;s bier spent the night of either 6 or 7 December 1290, or possibly both, in Geddington, Northamptonshire. The master mason for the cross here is not known: it was probably constructed in 1294 or 1295. It was recorded by William Camden in 1607; and still stands in the centre of the village, the best-preserved of the three survivors. It is unique among the three in having a triangular plan, and a taller and more slender profile with a lower tier entirely covered with rosette diapering, instead of the arch-and-gable motif with tracery which appears on both the others; and canopied statues surmounted by a slender hexagonal pinnacle. It is possible that the other northern crosses (Lincoln, Grantham and Stamford) were in a similar relatively simple style; and that this reflects either the need to cut back expenditure in the latter stages of the project for financial reasons, or a decision taken at the planning stage to make the crosses progressively larger and more ornate as the sequence proceeded south.

An engraving of the Geddington cross (drawn by Jacob Schnebbelie and engraved by James Basire) was published by the Society of Antiquaries in its &quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot; series in 1791. It was &quot;discreetly&quot; restored in 1892.

===Hardingstone, Northampton===

Eleanor&#x27;s bier spent the night of 8 December 1290, and perhaps also that of 7 December, at Hardingstone, on the outskirts of Northampton. The cross here was constructed between 1291 and 1292 by John of Battle, at a total recorded cost of over £100. William of Ireland and Ralph of Chichester carved the statues. A causeway leading from the town to the cross was constructed by Robert son of Henry. The cross is still standing, close to Delapré Abbey, on the side of the A508 leading out of Northampton, and just north of the junction with the A45. The King stayed nearby at Northampton Castle.

The monument is octagonal in shape and set on steps; the present steps are replacements. It is built in three tiers, and originally had a crowning terminal, presumably a cross. The terminal appears to have gone by 1460: there is mention of a &quot;headless cross&quot; at the site from which Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, watched Margaret of Anjou&#x27;s flight following the Battle of Northampton. The monument was restored in 1713, to mark the Peace of Utrecht and the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, and this work included the fitting of a new terminal in the form of a Maltese cross. Further repairs were undertaken in 1762. At a later restoration in 1840, under the direction of Edward Blore, the Maltese cross was replaced by the picturesque broken shaft which is seen today. Later, less intrusive restorations were undertaken in 1877 and 1986. Further restoration work was completed in 2019.

The bottom tier of the monument has carvings of open books. These probably included painted inscriptions of Eleanor&#x27;s biography and of prayers for her soul to be said by viewers, now lost.

John Leland, in the early 1540s, recorded it as &quot;a right goodly crosse, caullid, as I remembre, the Quenes Crosse&quot;, although he seems to have associated it with the 1460 Battle of Northampton. It is also referred to by Daniel Defoe in his &quot;Tour thro&#x27; the Whole Island of Great Britain&quot;, in reporting the Great Fire of Northampton in 1675: &quot;... a townsman being at Queen&#x27;s Cross upon a hill on the south side of the town, about two miles () off, saw the fire at one end of the town then newly begun, and that before he could get to the town it was burning at the remotest end, opposite where he first saw it.&quot;

Celia Fiennes in 1697 describes it as &quot;a Cross, a mile off the town call&#x27;d High-Cross – it stands just in the middle of England – its all stone 12 stepps which runs round it, above that is the stone carv&#x27;d finely and there are 4 large Nitches about the middle, in each is the statue of some queen at length which encompasses it with other carvings as garnish, and so it rises less and less to the top like a tower or Piramidy.&quot;

An engraving of the Hardingstone cross (drawn by Jacob Schnebbelie and engraved by James Basire) was published by the Society of Antiquaries in its &quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot; series in 1791.

===Stony Stratford===

Eleanor&#x27;s bier spent the night of 9 December 1290 at Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire. The cross here was built between 1291 and 1293 by John of Battle at a total recorded cost of over £100. The supplier of the statues is uncertain, but some smaller carvings were provided by Ralph of Chichester. The cross stood at the lower end of the town, towards the River Ouse, on Watling Street (now the High Street), although its exact location is debated. It is said to have been of a tall elegant design (perhaps similar to that at Geddington). It was described by William Camden in 1607 as &quot;minus elegantem&quot; (&quot;none of the fairest&quot;), suggesting that it was by this date in a state of decay. It is said to have been demolished in about 1643. In 1735, William Hartley, a man of nearly 80, could remember only the base still standing. Any trace has now vanished.

The cross is commemorated by a brass plaque on the wall of 157 High Street.

===Woburn===
Eleanor&#x27;s bier spent the night of 10 December 1290 at Woburn, Bedfordshire. Work on the cross here started in 1292, later than some of the others, and was completed in the spring of 1293. It was built by John of Battle, at a total recorded cost of over £100. As at Stony Stratford, the supplier of the statues is uncertain, but some of the carvings were provided by Ralph of Chichester. No part of the cross survives. Its precise location, and its fate, are unknown.

===Dunstable===
Eleanor&#x27;s bier spent the night of 11 December 1290 at Dunstable, Bedfordshire. It rested first in the market place, before being carried into Dunstable Priory church, where the canons prayed in an overnight vigil. The cross was built between 1291 and 1293 by John of Battle at a total recorded cost of over £100. Some of the sculpture was supplied by Ralph of Chichester. It is thought to have been located in the middle of the town, probably in the market place, and was reported by William Camden as still standing in 1586. It is said to have been demolished in 1643 by troops under the Earl of Essex. No part survives, although some of the foundations are reported to have been discovered during roadworks at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Eleanor&#x27;s Cross Shopping Precinct in High Street North contains a modern statue of Eleanor, erected in 1985.

===St Albans===

Eleanor&#x27;s bier spent the night of 12 December 1290 at St Albans, Hertfordshire. The cross here was built between 1291 and 1293 by John of Battle at a total recorded cost of over £100, with some of the sculpture supplied by Ralph of Chichester. It was erected at the south end of the Market Place, and for many years stood in front of the fifteenth-century Clock Tower in the High Street, opposite the Waxhouse Gateway entrance to the Abbey.

In 1596, it was described as &quot;verie stately&quot;. However, having fallen into decay, and having probably been further damaged during the Civil War, it was eventually demolished in 1701–02, to be replaced by a market cross. This was demolished in turn in 1810, although the town pump it contained survived a little longer. A drinking fountain was erected on the site by philanthropist Isabella Worley in 1874: this was relocated to Victoria Square nearby in the late 20th century.

A late 19th-century ceramic plaque on the Clock Tower commemorates the Eleanor cross.

===Waltham (now Waltham Cross)===
Eleanor&#x27;s bier spent the night of 13 December 1290 in the parish of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. The cross here was built in about 1291 by Roger of Crundale and Nicholas Dymenge at a total recorded cost of over £110. It probably became known as &quot;Waltham Cross&quot; because it stood at the way to Waltham Abbey, across the River Lea in Essex, which was clearly visible from its site. The sculpture was by Alexander of Abingdon, with some items supplied by Robert of Corfe. The cross was located outside the village of Waltham, but as the village grew into a town in the 17th and 18th centuries, it began to suffer damage from passing traffic. In 1721, at the instigation of William Stukeley and at the expense of the Society of Antiquaries, two oak bollards were erected &quot;to secure Waltham Cross from injury by carriages&quot;. The bollards were subsequently removed by the turnpike commissioners, and in 1757 Stukeley arranged for a protective brick plinth to be erected instead, at the expense of Lord Monson. The cross is still standing, but has been restored on several occasions, in 1832–1834, 1885–1892, 1950–1953, and 1989–90.

The Society of Antiquaries published an engraving of the cross by George Vertue from a drawing by Stukeley in its &quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot; series in 1721; and another, engraved by James Basire from a drawing by Jacob Schnebbelie, in the same series in 1791.

The original statues of Eleanor, which were extremely weathered, were replaced by replicas at the 1950s restoration. The originals were kept for some years at Cheshunt Public Library; but they were removed, possibly in the 1980s, and are now held by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. A photograph formerly on the Lowewood Museum website shows one of the original statues in front of a staircase at the library.

===Westcheap (now Cheapside)===

Eleanor&#x27;s bier reached the City of London on 14 December 1290, and a site for the cross was selected in Westcheap (now Cheapside). Her heart was buried in the Blackfriars priory on 19 December. The Cheapside cross was built from 1291 onwards by Michael of Canterbury at a total recorded cost of £226 13s. 4d.

Under a licence granted by Henry VI in 1441, the cross was extensively restored or rebuilt in 1484–86. It was subsequently regilded several times in the 16th century on the occasion of coronations and royal visits to the City. John Stow included a detailed account of the cross and its history in his &quot;Survay of London&quot; of 1598, updating it in 1603.

Although a number of images of the cross and its eventual destruction are known, these all postdate its various refurbishments, and so provide no certain guide to its original appearance. However, the chronicler Walter of Guisborough refers to this and Charing Cross as being fashioned of &quot;marble&quot;; and it is likely that it was similar to the Hardingstone and Waltham Crosses, but even more ornate and boasting some Purbeck marble facings.

The cross came to be regarded as something of a public hazard, both as a traffic obstruction and because of concerns about fragments of stone falling off; while in the post-Reformation period some of its Catholic imagery aroused resentment, and elements were defaced in 1581, 1599 and 1600–01. Matters came to a head during the years leading up to the Civil War. To puritanical reformers, it was identified with Dagon, the ancient god of the Philistines, and was seen as the embodiment of royal and Catholic tradition. At least one riot was fought in its shadow, as opponents of the cross descended upon it to pull it down, and supporters rallied to stop them. After Charles I had fled London to raise an army, the destruction of the cross was almost the first order of business for the Parliamentary Committee for the Demolition of Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry, led by Sir Robert Harley, and it was demolished on 2 May 1643. The downfall of the Cheapside Cross is an important episode of iconoclasm in English history.

Two Purbeck marble fragments of the original cross, displaying shields bearing the royal arms of England and of Castile and León, were recovered in 1838 during reconstruction of the sewer in Cheapside. They are now held by the Museum of London.

=== Charing (now Charing Cross) ===
Eleanor&#x27;s bier spent the final night of its journey, 16 December 1290, in the Royal Mews at Charing, Westminster, a few hundred yards north of Westminster Abbey. The area subsequently became known as Charing Cross. The cross here was the most expensive of the twelve, built of Purbeck marble from 1291 onwards by Richard of Crundale, the senior royal mason, with the sculptures supplied by Alexander of Abingdon, and some items by Ralph de Chichester. Richard died in the autumn of 1293, and the work was completed by Roger of Crundale, probably his brother. The total recorded cost was over £700.
The cross stood outside the Royal Mews, at the top of what is now Whitehall, and on the south side of what is now Trafalgar Square. John Norden in about 1590 described it as the &quot;most stately&quot; of the series, but by this date so &quot;defaced by antiquity&quot; as to have become &quot;an old weather-beaten monument&quot;. It was also noted by William Camden in 1607.

It was ordered to be taken down by Parliament in 1643, and was eventually demolished in 1647. Following the demolition, a contemporary ballad ran:
&lt;poem&gt;Undone! undone! the lawyers cry,
They ramble up and down;
We know not the way to &quot;Westminster&quot;
Now &quot;Charing-Cross&quot; is down.&lt;/poem&gt;

After the Restoration of Charles II, an equestrian statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur was erected on the site of the cross in 1675, and this still stands. The location is still known as Charing Cross, and since the early 19th century this point has been regarded as the official centre of London, in legislation and when measuring distances from London.

A new Eleanor cross was erected in 1865 outside Charing Cross railway station, several hundred yards from the original site: see Replicas and imitations below.
A mural by David Gentleman on the platform walls of Charing Cross underground station, commissioned by London Transport in 1978, depicts, in the form of wood engravings, the story of the building of the medieval cross by stonemasons and sculptors.

Folk etymology holds that the name Charing derives from French (dear queen); but the name &quot;Charing&quot; for the area in fact pre-dates Eleanor&#x27;s death and probably comes from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;&quot;, meaning a bend, as it stands on the outside of a sharp bend in the River Thames (compare Charing in Kent).

==Replicas and imitations==
During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries several replica Eleanor crosses, or monuments more loosely inspired by them, were erected.
*The cross at Ilam, Staffordshire, was built in 1840 by Jesse Watts-Russell of Ilam Hall to commemorate his wife, Mary.
*The Martyrs&#x27; Memorial in Oxford, commemorating the 16th-century Oxford Martyrs, was erected in 1841–1843 to the designs of George Gilbert Scott.
*The Glastonbury Market Cross, Somerset, was erected in 1846 to the designs of Benjamin Ferrey.
*Banbury Cross, Oxfordshire, was erected in 1859 to commemorate the marriage of Victoria, Princess Royal to Prince Frederick of Prussia: it was designed by John Gibbs.
*The Queen Eleanor Memorial Cross at Charing Cross in London was erected in 1865 outside Charing Cross railway station on the Strand, a few hundred yards to the east of the site of the medieval cross. It does not pretend to be a faithful copy of the original, being larger and more ornate. It stands high and was commissioned by the South Eastern Railway Company for their newly opened Charing Cross Hotel. The cross was designed by the hotel architect, E. M. Barry, who is also known for his work on Covent Garden. It was constructed by Thomas Earp of Lambeth from Portland stone, Mansfield stone (a fine sandstone) and Aberdeen granite. It was restored to a substantial extent in 2009–10.
*The Ellesmere Memorial at Walkden, Lancashire, was erected in 1868 to the designs of T. G. Jackson to commemorate Harriet (d. 1866), wife of the 1st Earl of Ellesmere. It originally stood at a road junction, but was moved into the churchyard in 1968.
*The Albert Memorial, in Kensington Gardens, London, commissioned by Queen Victoria in memory of her husband Prince Albert, and completed in 1872. It is a far larger structure than any of the Eleanor crosses, but takes inspiration from them. Its architect, Sir Gilbert Scott, claimed to have &quot;adopt[ed] in my design the style at once most congenial with my own feelings, and that of the most touching monuments ever erected in this country to a Royal Consort – the exquisite &#x27;Eleanor Crosses&#x27;&quot;.
* The Loudoun Monument, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, was designed by Sir Gilbert Scott and erected in 1879 to commemorate Edith Rawdon-Hastings, 10th Countess of Loudoun (d. 1874), wife of Charles Frederick Abney-Hastings.
*The Sledmere Cross was erected in Sledmere, East Riding of Yorkshire, in 1896–8, commissioned by Sir Tatton Sykes and designed by Temple Lushington Moore. Sir Tatton&#x27;s son, Sir Mark Sykes, later added engraved brasses to turn it into a war memorial.
*The Queen Victoria Monument, Birkenhead, Wirral, Merseyside, designed by Edmund Kirby, was unveiled in 1905. 
*A modern monument inspired by (but not directly modelled on) the lost medieval cross was erected in Stamford in 2009. It was designed by Wolfgang Buttress and sponsored by the Smith of Derby Group; and it stands in Sheepmarket, rather than at the original location. It takes the form of a tall stone and bronze spike: the carved detail is based on the single surviving fragment of the medieval cross.

<doc id="75539" wikidata="Q7495533" url="?curid=75539" title="Sherwood Forest Plantation">
<text>Sherwood Forest Plantation Foundation is located on the north bank of the James River in Charles City County, Virginia. The main plantation house, built in 1730, was the home of the tenth president of the United States, John Tyler (1790–1862) for the last twenty years of his life. It is located on State Route 5, a scenic byway which runs between the independent cities of Richmond and Williamsburg. The house is located approximately from the river. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.

== History ==

It is a misconception that Sherwood Forest is the only private residence in the United States to have been owned by two unrelated U.S. presidents. William Henry Harrison owned a plot of land called &quot;Brown&#x27;s Quarter&quot; in the same county, and another (different) Brown&#x27;s Quarter existed within the acreage that came to make up the land that Tyler later purchased. Harrison&#x27;s vice president and successor John Tyler purchased the plantation in 1842 from his cousin Collier Minge and lived there after leaving the White House. 

John Tyler renamed the plantation Sherwood Forest in 1842. He said it signified that he had been &quot;outlawed&quot; by the Whig party. He was attracted to the plantation because it was near his birthplace at Greenway Plantation. He retired there when he left the White House in 1845 and spent the rest of his life there with his second wife Julia Gardiner Tyler and some of his children. He had eight with his first wife and seven with his second wife.

Pearl, the youngest, was born in 1860, when Tyler was 70 years old; she died in 1947.

As regional hostilities in the United States escalated to become the American Civil War in 1861, Tyler backed Virginia&#x27;s secession, although he died in January 1862. Later that spring, the house was occupied by Union soldiers during McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula Campaign of 1862 and again during Grant&#x27;s Overland Campaign in 1864. During the latter, the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Wharf was fought nearby. When an Ohio regiment vacated the house in 1864, they attempted to raze it with fire as a punishment for Tyler&#x27;s support of the Confederacy. The fire was quickly extinguished by a loyal slave and did little damage to the house.

Owners of the house who started restoring it in the mid-1970s started removing some home-made storm windows and then discovered from old records that Tyler had built them himself, so they kept them. One of the house&#x27;s claims to fame is its length; 301 feet (91 m). It is noted for its long, skinny ballroom, a &quot;hyphen&quot; Tyler had added to the house to accommodate the style of dancing popular then - what is today called &quot;line dancing&quot; but was then the &quot;Virginia reel.&quot;

The house has been in the Tyler family since it was purchased in 1842. The house currently is owned by Harrison Ruffin Tyler, President Tyler&#x27;s grandson and the son of Lyon Gardiner Tyler; he and his wife, Frances Payne Bouknight Tyler, restored the home and grounds based on information gathered from over 47,000 letters describing the decor, furnishings, and landscape. It is open to the public for tours by appointment. The grounds are open daily for self-guided tours from 9am-5pm excepting Thanksgiving and Christmas days.

==Cemetery==

A pet cemetery is located on the property, where Tyler family pets were and still are buried, most notably, John Tyler&#x27;s horse, The General.

Staff at the site also maintain a small grove where Tyler planned to be buried. In January 1862, while in Richmond to serve in the Confederate House of Representatives, Tyler became seriously ill. He died while arranging plans to return to Sherwood Forest, and his request to be buried at his home was ignored. He was instead buried at Richmond’s Hollywood Cemetery.

<text>Arbroath () or Aberbrothock ( ) is a former royal burgh and the largest town in the council area of Angus, Scotland, with a population of 23,902. It lies on the North Sea coast, some east-northeast of Dundee and south-southwest of Aberdeen.

There is evidence of Iron Age settlement, but its history as a town began with the founding of Arbroath Abbey in 1178. It grew much during the Industrial Revolution through the flax and then the jute industry and the engineering sector. A new harbour was created in 1839; by the 20th century, Arbroath was one of Scotland&#x27;s larger fishing ports.

The town is notable for the Declaration of Arbroath and the Arbroath smokie. Arbroath Football Club holds the world record for the number of goals scored in a professional football match: 36–0 against Bon Accord of Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup in 1885.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The earliest recorded name was &#x27;Aberbrothock&#x27;, referring to the Brothock Burn that runs through the town. The prefix &quot;Aber&quot; derived either from the Gaelic &#x27;Obair&#x27;, or the earlier Brythonic term &quot;Aber&quot; for confluence or river mouth. The name Aberbrothock was spelt numerous ways. The earliest manuscripts available have it as &quot;Abirbrothoke&quot; (in a letter to Edward I confirming the Treaty of Salisbury, which agreed that the Queen regnant, Margaret, Maid of Norway would marry Edward I) and &quot;Aberbrothok&quot; (in a subsequent letter of consent to the marriage). In the Declaration of Arbroath, it is seen as &quot;Abirbrothoc&quot;. Early maps show a number of variants including Aberbrothock, Aberbrothik, Aberbrothick, and Aberbrothwick.

The modern name Arbroath came into common use from the mid-19th century, the older name being largely dropped by the time of the first Ordnance Survey edition. However, variants of &#x27;Arbroath&#x27; had been used since the 17th century, including &#x27;Arbroth&#x27; and Aberbreth.

===Early history===

The area of Arbroath has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic period. Material from postholes at an enclosure at Douglasmuir, near Friockheim, some five miles north of Arbroath, have been radiocarbon dated to about 3500 BCE. The function of the enclosure is unknown – perhaps for agriculture or for ceremonial purposes.

Bronze Age finds are abundant in the area. They include short-cist burials near West Newbigging, about a mile north of the town, which yielded pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet. Iron Age archaeology is also present, for example in the souterrain near Warddykes Cemetery and at West Grange of Conan, as well as better-known examples at Carlungie and Ardestie.

The area appears to have had importance in the early Christian period, as shown by Pictish stone carvings found during restoration of St Vigeans Church, now housed in the small museum there. The stones had been used in building the old church and many were badly damaged. One of them, the 9th century Drosten Stone, is among the few Pictish artefacts with a Latin inscription: DROSTEN: IREUORET [E]TTFOR CUS&#x27;. This has been variously construed, but is thought to refer to the Pictish King Uurad, who reigned in 839–842 CE.

===Medieval history===

The recorded history of Arbroath begins with the foundation of the Abbey by King William the Lion in 1178 for monks of the Tironensian order from Kelso Abbey. It was consecrated in 1197 with a dedication to Saint Thomas Becket, as the King&#x27;s only personal foundation; he was buried within its precincts in 1214. The Abbey was not finally completed until 1233.

King John, also in the 13th century, exempted Arbroath from &quot;toll and custom&quot; in every part of England except London.

On 6 April 1320 the Scottish Parliament met at Arbroath Abbey and addressed to the Pope the Declaration of Arbroath, drafted by the Abbot of the time, Bernard. This detailed the services which their &quot;lord and sovereign&quot; Robert the Bruce had rendered to Scotland and eloquently affirmed Scots independence.

The Battle of Arbroath in 1446 came after a series of clashes between the Chief Justiciary of Arbroath, Alexander Lindsay, third Earl of Crawford and Bishop James Kennedy of St Andrews, which resulted in Lindsay sacking the bishop&#x27;s lands and burning his properties. Lindsay was excommunicated and it was felt this conflicted with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. Large parts of it were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.

The abbey soon fell into disuse and eventual disrepair after its dissolution at the Reformation. The roof lead is rumoured to have been used in the 16th-century civil wars and the stonework plundered for housebuilding in the town. The ruins were a popular site for travellers in the 17th and 18th centuries. Finally in 1815, they were taken into state care. They are now administered by Historic Scotland.

===Modern history===
The Jacobite rising known as the Forty-Five turned Arbroath into a Jacobite town. A high proportion of its able-bodied men joined the Jacobite army. It was one of the main ports where men and supplies could be landed from France. It and other Jacobite ports along the north-east coast collectively formed &#x27;an asset of almost incalculable value&#x27; to the Jacobite cause.

The Industrial Revolution led to an expansion of Arbroath&#x27;s economy and population. New housing was built for the influx of workers and Arbroath became known for jute and sailcloth production. In 1867, the mills employed 4,620 people and in 1875, 1,400 looms in 34 mills produced over a million yards of osnaburg cloth and 450,000 yards of sailcloth; the town is believed to have supplied the sails for &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;. Arbroath was also prominent in the making of shoes and lawnmowers. Manufacturer Alexander Shanks, founded in 1840 and based at Dens Iron Works from 1853, supplied mowers to the Old Course at St Andrews and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. Shanks was taken over in the 1960s by local firm, Giddings &amp; Lewis-Fraser Ltd., which had evolved from the flax and canvas manufacturing business established by Douglas Fraser in 1832. In the last decade of the 19th century, Douglas Fraser &amp; Sons shifted focus to machine manufacture following the success of a braiding machine designed by Norman Fraser. The firm had interests in South America and India. In 1959 the business was taken over by the US company, Giddings &amp; Lewis and renamed Giddings &amp; Lewis-Fraser. Its headquarters were Wellgate Works, Arbroath.

Arbroath is well known for its ties to the fishing industry. Following significant improvements to the harbour in 1839, the council sought fishermen willing to migrate to the town. Men came from nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. The industry grew, and in the peak years up to 1980 some 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, employing hundreds on board and hundreds more ashore to service vessels and process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took their toll in Scotland from the 1980s; however, Arbroath remains a whitefish port open for landing shellfish. Only one vessel now works regularly from Arbroath, but a further three Arbroath-owned vessels work from Aberdeen and ports further north. Fish processing remains a big employer, but the fish come from Aberdeen, Peterhead and even Iceland, Norway and Ireland.

==Governance==
Arbroath was made a burgh of regality in 1178 by King William the Lion, when the Abbey was founded. The burgh of regality permitted monks to hold a weekly market, dispense basic justice and establish a harbour. In 1599, the town was granted royal burgh status by King James VI of Scotland. A provost and town council were appointed.

In 1922, Lord Inchcape became burgess. He was presented with his ticket to the office in a silver casket engraved with the burgh coat-of-arms and views of the locality.

Arbroath remained controlled by Arbroath Burgh Council, which was based at Arbroath Town House, through to 1975, when Arbroath (and the county of Angus) were amalgamated with Perthshire and Dundee City into Tayside, controlled by Tayside Regional Council. Angus, along with Dundee City and Perth &amp; Kinross were re-established under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994.

Arbroath is represented on Angus Council by seven councillors; four from the ward of Arbroath West, Letham and Friockheim and three from Arbroath East &amp; Lunan.

===Parliamentary representation===
Arbroath is part of Arbroath and Broughty Ferry constituency for elections to the House of Commons. The seat was first contested at the 2024 general election where Stephen Gethins of the SNP won the seat.

Arbroath is in the Angus South constituency of the Scottish Parliament (having been in the Angus constituency until its abolition in 2011). It returns a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) to Holyrood directly. Graeme Dey of the Scottish National Party has won the seat in all three elections contested since its formation. Angus South forms part of the North East Scotland electoral region for electing additional Members of the Scottish Parliament.

==Geography==
At , Arbroath lies on the North Sea coast, north-east of Dundee, within the Angus region. Geologically, it sits predominantly on Old Red Sandstone. Lower-lying parts were below sea level until after the last Ice Age.

Arbroath lies north-east of Glasgow, south-west of Aberdeen and from Edinburgh. Neighbouring villages of St Vigeans, Carmyllie, Friockheim, Colliston and Inverkeilor are taken as part of Arbroath for council representation, and along with Carnoustie share its 01241 telephone area code.

=== Brothock Water ===
A burn (or stream) named Brothock Water flows through the town from St Vigeans parallel to the railway line, before turning to meet the North Sea at Danger Point immediately east of the harbour. Flax and jute mills congregated alongside the stream in the 19th century to use the water for their steam-powered machinery. Much of its course within the town is open but some parts have been built over. The burn and its environs form a green artery between residential areas and along with the railway line divides the town, east to west. Data collected by the Brothock Water monitoring station from 1990 onwards shows the water level to normally range between and . The highest recorded level of was reached on 2 November 2009. A £12 million publicly funded scheme to reduce flows in Brothock Water to protect parts of the town at risk from flooding was developed by Angus Council and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. The works, completed in December 2022, included the creation of flood storage areas at Dammy Meadows and north of the town.

===The shoreline===
South west of the harbour lies an area of craggy rocks with a large number of rock pools exposed at low tide. Rocks, boulders and shingle extend for about nine hundred metres to Arbroath West Links (or Elliot) beach. This gently sloping beach is of mixed sand and pebbles and the sea here is a designated bathing water site of about in length. The main access to the beach is via a slipway, but there are also steps down from the coastal path. Depending on the tide, the width of the beach can vary from twenty to two hundred metres.

Arbroath (or Seaton) cliffs rise about north east of the harbour. Whiting Ness at the end of the King&#x27;s Drive promenade is an example of geological angular unconformity; a coarse conglomerate of late Devonian upper red sandstone overlies early Devonian lower red sandstone.

==Climate==
Arbroath has a typical British marine climate influenced by its seaside position. There are narrow temperature differences between seasons. January has an average high of and July of . The climate is somewhat dry and sunny for Scotland, with of precipitation and 1561.7 hours of sunshine. The data are sourced from the 1991–2020 averages of the Met Office weather station in Arbroath.

==Demography==
Residents of Arbroath are called Arbroathians but often call themselves &quot;Red Lichties&quot; after the red lamp that shone from the harbour light and foghorn tower at the harbour entrance, as an aid to shipping entering the harbour.

Scotland&#x27;s census of 2011 reports the total resident population of Arbroath as 23,902, a 4.9 per cent increase over the 22,785 reported by the 2001 census. About 86.5 per cent of the population was born in Scotland, down from 88.9 per cent in 2001 and 95.6 per cent was born in the United Kingdom as a whole (2001: 97.7 per cent). In 2011, Arbroath had a higher percentage of its population under 16 years of age (18.3 per cent) than Scotland (17.3 per cent). Persons aged 65 years and over are put at 18.9 per cent compared with Scotland&#x27;s 16.8 per cent. Arbroath correspondingly has a lower percentage of 16 to 64 year olds than Scotland. In 2011 there were 47.8 per cent males to 52.2 per cent females.

Arbroath has a moderate unemployment rate – some 2.7 per cent claim job-related social welfare benefits.

==Economy==
The 2011 census shows Arbroath to have an economically active population of 10,545 (2001: 9,192); of which jobs in health and social work account for 16.0 per cent of total employment (2001: 13.1 per cent), closely followed by wholesale and retail trade and repairs with 15.2 per cent (2001: 15.4 per cent). Manufacturing, the top employment sector in 2001 with 16.0 per cent, fell to third place in 2011 with 12.3 per cent. A separate figure for the fishing industry is not shown for 2011 but accounted for only 0.4 per cent (fewer than 50 people) in 2001, although the processing sector is counted separately under manufacturing and the figure of 50 relates directly to the catching and support sectors.

===The port===
Arbroath&#x27;s prospects originally revolved around the harbour. The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the terms of an agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy, the abbot in 1394 AD. This gave way to a more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the sea wall, quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour, at a cost of £58,000. Arbroath became a major coastal shipping port and in 1846 there were 89 Arbroath-registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) and the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with manufactured goods (mainly sailcloth) exported.
=== Manufacturing ===
Driven by the needs of the fishing and sailing industry, Arbroath-based sailmaker Francis Webster Ltd perfected in 1795 the art of adding linseed oil to flax sails, creating an oiled flax. This developed in the late 19th century into waxed cotton, which drove Arbroath as a manufacturing centre until the early 1970s, when it began to decline. A major employer, Keith &amp; Blackman, closed in 1985 and Giddings and Lewis-Fraser wound down about the same time, with the whole plant later demolished to make way for a supermarket. Alps Electric Co. was a large employer in Arbroath from 1990 to 2001, employing 180. All were made redundant when the plant closed.

===Armed forces===
Arbroath is home to 45 Commando of the Royal Marines, which has been based at RM Condor since 1971. The barracks were built in 1940 and commissioned as RNAS Arbroath/HMS Condor, a Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) until 1971. The Royal Marines moved to Arbroath in 1971 and remain a contributor to the local economy; in addition to the Marines stationed at Arbroath, some 600 residents are employed by the Ministry of Defence. In 2004, there was speculation that RM Condor would be transferred to the Army as a replacement for Fort George and the barracks become a permanent base for a battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. This went no further than the planning stage and in 2005 it was confirmed the Marines would remain.

===Housing===
House prices in Arbroath in April–June 2006 were just £99 below national average: £113,646 compared to a national £113,745. The average house price across Angus rose by 14.9 per cent to £124,451 in the year up to November 2006. Angus Council suggests the upgrading of the A92 between Arbroath and Dundee to a dual carriageway has lured Dundonians to Arbroath, which may be boosting house prices.

===Tourism===
A visitor survey compiled in 2017 found Arbroath to be the most popular destination in Angus and Arbroath Abbey the second most visited attraction after Glamis Castle. Arbroath Abbey receives around 14,000 visitors annually. A re-enactment of the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath (the declaration of Scottish independence) known as the Scots&#x27; or Arbroath Pageant has taken place in the Abbey ruins intermittently since 1947. The last full pageant took place in 2005 but a smaller ceremony is usually performed on the 6 April each year to commemorate the signing.

==== Former attractions ====

A summer event known as the Seafront Spectacular took place in the 2000s. The program for 2006 included flying displays, a sea rescue demonstration, exhibition of motor vehicles and fairground rides. The Sea Fest, an event themed around Arbroath&#x27;s maritime heritage, was held annually for 21 years until 2017. Kerr&#x27;s Miniature Railway was the oldest miniature railway in Scotland at the time of its closure in October 2020. It opened in 1935 and at its height, in 1955, drew 60,000 visitors; however numbers had fallen to just 3,500 in 2019. The Harbour Visitor Centre on Fishmarket Quay was completed in 2007. It was the focus of Angus Council&#x27;s attempt to increase the number of tourists to the harbour. The centre originally housed a multimedia experience explaining the town&#x27;s fishing history and a VisitScotland tourist information centre; both have closed and the space vacated let for commercial use.

==Transport==

The A92 dual carriageway connects Arbroath to Dundee and crosses the Tay estuary into Fife via the Tay Road Bridge. North to Montrose and Stonehaven the A92 is single carriageway but thereafter is dualled to Aberdeen. The A933 road runs north to Brechin. Within the town, the A92 was formerly dualled prior to 2024, when it was singled to allow a dedicated cycle-path and additional green space to be created.

Destinations from Arbroath Bus Station include Brechin, Dundee, Forfar and Montrose. The bus station is also a stopping point on the X7 Coastrider route that runs between Aberdeen and Perth. Stagecoach East Scotland under its Stagecoach Strathtay brand operates most services.

Arbroath railway station is a short walk from the bus station. The station facilities and most of the passenger trains are operated by ScotRail. Direct services run along the east coast of Scotland to Aberdeen and via Dundee to Edinburgh and Glasgow with onward connections to London and other English cities. The overnight Caledonian Sleeper stops at Arbroath en route to London Euston.

The closest regional airport, Dundee has flights to London City, George Best Belfast City and Sumburgh. The airport lies 1.8 miles west of the city centre, adjacent to the River Tay. The nearest international airports are Edinburgh and Aberdeen. There is a sizeable airfield at the Royal Marines military base on the western outskirts of the town. It was created in 1940 as a Fleet Air Arm airfield and had a training role during World War II. The airstrip was used by a Volunteer Gliding Squadron up until 2016.

==Education==
Further education is provided at the Arbroath campus of Dundee and Angus College, based in the former Arbroath High School buildings. The town has two secondary schools and seven primary schools. One primary school is Roman Catholic, the remainder non-denominational.

===Secondary schools===
The two secondaries are Arbroath High School on Keptie Road and Arbroath Academy in the Hayshead area of the town. The High School was originally a grammar school; a notable alumni is former Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth. It caters for around 880 pupils and has a catchment area of west Arbroath and the villages of Arbirlot, Carmyllie and Colliston. The Academy, originally a comprehensive, opened in 1962. It has a school roll of around 700 pupils and a catchment area that includes east Arbroath and the villages of Auchmithie, Inverkeilor and Friockheim.

===Further education===
Angus College was established in 1957. In the mid 2000s, Angus College had around 8,500 students, with 80 per cent passing the course for which they enrol. There are about 1,700 full-time students, with part-time students making up the majority. On 1 November 2013, Angus College merged with Dundee College to form Dundee and Angus College. Arbroath is not a student town and there are no student residences. The student population is solely local students living within commuting distance of the college. The Arbroath campus offers mostly full and part time vocational courses from SCQF level 1 up to Higher National Diploma (level 8).

==Places of worship==

Twelve denominations spread over twenty two places of worship are listed for Arbroath in a survey of Scotland published in 1884; all bar The Old Church are described as &quot;modern&quot;. Only a handful of these remain in use as places of worship. Some redundant church buildings have been demolished but alternative uses have been found for others, including The Old Church, the United Presbyterian Erskine Church in Commerce Street and the High Street and Brothock Bridge United Free Churches.

=== Church of Scotland ===
The Old and Abbey Church is in the centre of town on West Abbey Street. Formerly known as the Abbey Church, its name was changed on uniting with the Old Parish Church after the latter&#x27;s closure in 1990. Abbey Church was originally built as a chapel of ease to the Old Parish Church in 1797 and was greatly extended in 1876–8 with the addition of the tower and Gothic style front facade.

St Andrew&#x27;s is in Hamilton Green, and the minister is Rev. Dr. Martin Fair with associate minister Rev. Stuart Irvin. Dr Fair was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 2020–2021; the only time that a minister of a congregation in Arbroath has held the position.

The West Kirk in Keptie Street was opened as St Margaret&#x27;s Chapel of Ease in 1879 and upgraded to a parish church in 1886. The height of the tower was doubled in 1903 by the addition of two storeys, a parapet and pinnacles. St Margaret&#x27;s changed its name to Arbroath West Kirk in 1990 when joined by the members of Ladyloan St Columba&#x27;s following that church&#x27;s closure. Falling attendances at Knox&#x27;s Church lead to its congregation uniting with West Kirk in 2019 and the site in Howard Street being put up for sale. Knox&#x27;s Church was built in 1866 and linked with St Vigeans Church, St Vigeans in 1983.

=== Other congregations ===

There is an Episcopalian congregation based at St Mary the Virgin Church in Springfield Terrace. The minister is Rev. Peter Mead. St Mary&#x27;s Church evolved from a meeting house set up in 1694 by Episcopalians forced out of Arbroath Parish Church. The present church building dates from 1854. The Scottish Episcopal Church in Arbroath is part of the Diocese of Brechin.

St Thomas of Canterbury Roman Catholic Church is in Dishlandtown Street. The church opened in 1848 and has distinctive twin octagonal and crenellated front towers. The priest is the Rev. Fr. Andrew Marshall and the church is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunkeld. The parish includes a primary school which celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1998.

St John&#x27;s Methodist Church in Ponderlaw was opened and preached in by John Wesley in 1772 and since the closure of Dunbar Methodist Church has been the oldest Scottish Methodist Church still used for worship. The original church building is octagonal and situated behind a vestibule added in 1882.

Other groups that worship in Arbroath include the Arbroath Corps of the Salvation Army, which meets in Marketgate; the Elim Pentecostal Church, which meets in Ogilvy Place; the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, who meet at the Kingdom Hall in Burnside Drive; the Springfield Christian Assembly, which meets in the Gospel Hall in Ponderlaw Lane and the Arbroath Town Mission on Grant Road, an interdenominational group established in 1849 and led by Dr Robert Clapham for sixty years, until 2010. The independent, non-denominational Life Church meet in the former St Vigeans Chapel of Ease in James Street. The church building dates from 1828 and became Inverbrothock Parish Church in 1855. The parish was dissolved in 1977.

==Culture==
The ANGUSalive Community Trust manages Arbroath Library and Art Gallery, Webster Memorial Theatre, Signal Tower Museum, Arbroath Community Centre and Arbroath Sports Centre.

On permanent display in the Corsar Gallery at Arbroath Art Gallery are &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot; and &quot;Saint John Preaching in the Wilderness;&quot; two large oil paintings attributed to Pieter Brueghel the Younger. The art gallery and public library are housed within a former school, The Academy, built in 1821 to a design by Dundee architect James Black. The building was bought for the town by former Provost, David Corsar, owner of a flaxspinning and manufacturing business. It was converted by local architect, Hugh Gavin and opened to much fanfare in 1898.  

The Webster Memorial Theatre building was opened as &quot;The Public Hall&quot; in 1867; James Maclaren of Dundee was the architect. As well as a large hall there was a library, reading-room, museum and smaller hall. The Arbroath Guide newspaper acclaimed the front facade to be &quot;the finest thing in architecture we have in the town&quot;. The first public performance was by a troupe of Christy&#x27;s Minstrels. The hall was renamed in memory of First World War casualty Joseph Webster, on his family gifting it to the town in 1919. Besides concerts, the hall was used for political addresses and lectures. HRH Princess Margaret reopened the hall in October 1970 as the Webster Memorial Theatre and Arts Centre, after major works and refurbishment. The front stonework was renovated, the auditorium remodelled and disabled access improved in 2008. The main auditorium seats five hundred. The theatre has featured among others Harry Lauder, Jimmy Tarbuck, Charlie Landsborough, The Drifters and the Chuckle Brothers and was the first venue the Alexander Brothers, a Scottish easy listening act, performed in as a professional duo.

The 10 year-old Marion Angus arrived in Arbroath in February 1876, when her father became minister at the Erskine United Presbyterian Church. An early contributor to the poetry of the Scottish Renaissance, in her early thirties she wrote &quot;The Diary of Arthur Ogilvie&quot; (1897–98) and &quot;Christabel&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1899) columns for the &quot;Arbroath Guide&quot;, sardonically chronicling the development of the town, musical concerts, visiting dramatic productions, and Church soirées.

The Angus Black and White Minstrels were the last group in Britain to regularly perform blackface. In 2005, after pressure from Angus Council, the show began with normal stage makeup and the group changed its name to The Angus Minstrels. The move to stop performing in blackface received wide UK press coverage. The group performed its farewell concert in November 2019 and made a final charitable donation in 2022.

Beginning in 1947, a pageant commemorating the signing of the Declaration has been held within the roofless remains of the abbey (last full-scale event 2005). This was run by the local Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society, now Arbroath Abbey Timethemes, a registered charity, and re-enacts the story and history of the signing. The group also spearhead Scotland&#x27;s Tartan Day celebrations on 6 April in association with Angus Council as well as educational visits to local schools.

Arbroath Male Voice Choir was founded in 1934 and is one of the few remaining male voice choirs in Scotland. The choir sings a mix of songs from classical, through Scottish, show tunes and pop. It performs two main concerts each year, one at Christmas, another in spring. The choir is notable for attracting well known, often international singers to its annual spring concert. These have included, Jamie McDougall, Karen Cargill, Gordon Cree, Cheryl Forbes, Colette Ruddy and the international diva Lesley Garrett.

The author Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s famous &quot;Waverley&quot; series of novels includes &quot;Rob Roy&quot; and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. Scott is known to have visited Arbroath three times, and his personal favourite in the series, &quot;The Antiquary&quot; (1816), features fictionalised versions of Arbroath (&quot;Fairport&quot;) and Auchmithie (&quot;Musselcrag&quot;).

Arbroath has one museum, the former Bell Rock Lighthouse &quot;Signal Tower&quot;. In 1807 Arbroath became the base of operations for the building of the Bell Rock Lighthouse. The shore station for the lighthouse – the Bell Rock Signal Tower – was completed in 1813 and acted as a lifeline for the keepers offshore. Signal Tower Museum was opened in 1974 as a visitor centre, detailing the history of the lighthouse and the town of Arbroath.

Hospitalfield House, a baronial mansion to the west of the town, houses an educational charity promoting contemporary arts.

The town was twinned with &quot;THE HADDOCK THAT NEVER GOT SMOKED&quot; by the Intercontinental Twinning Association in July 2024 following a short email exchange with Bill Drummond, commemorative signage is due to be deployed later in the year.

===Arbroath smokies===

Arbroath smokies, known nationally and internationally, have been made solely in Arbroath since the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits their production to within of Arbroath Town House. Smokies are made from haddock by traditional methods dating back to the late 19th century. The fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, then left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a covered barrel containing a hardwood fire. After 45 minutes to an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively on the harbour area known as Fit o&#x27; the Toon. A large processor, R R Spink &amp; Sons, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains for a number of years, however this was discontinued when the firm concentrated on smoked salmon and trout.

==Sport==
Arbroath F.C., nicknamed the &quot;Red Lichties,&quot; is a semi-professional football team who play in the Scottish Championship, the second tier of the Scottish Professional Football League. The club plays its home matches at Gayfield Park. The stadium is set right on the North Sea coast, just 5½ yards (5 metres) from the high tide line. Arbroath F.C. holds the world record for the largest winning margin in a senior football match, 36–0, in their Scottish Cup match against Bon Accord (a scratch team from Aberdeen) on 12 September 1885. Arbroath Victoria F.C., a junior football club, plays its home matches at Olgilvy Park. Arbroath SC, another junior football club folded in 2011.

Arbroath Lawn Tennis Club&#x27;s origins date back to 1909. Despite its name the club no longer has grass courts at its home on Arbirlot Road. Blaes (red shale) a type of clay court surface, was in turn replaced by floodlit, all-weather hardcourts following a successful fundraising drive and grant from Sportscotland. Australian Open 2020 men&#x27;s doubles quarter finalist Jonny O&#x27;Mara is a former club member.

Arbroath has a rugby union club, Arbroath RFC, and several bowls clubs, with former World, British and current Commonwealth Games singles champion Darren Burnett a native of Arbroath.

Arbroath has a successful cricket club. It won the CSL Eastern Premiership in 2013 and the Scottish Cup in 2015.

Arbroath is a popular location for angling.

==Public services==
Water is supplied by Scottish Water from Lintrathen and Backwater reservoirs in Glen Isla. Electricity distribution is by Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks.

Waste management is handled by Angus Council. A kerbside recycling scheme has been in operation since May 2004. Cans, glass, paper and plastic bottles are collected on a weekly basis. Compostable material and non-recyclable material are collected on alternate weeks. Roughly two-thirds of non-recyclable material is sent to landfill at Angus Council&#x27;s site at Lochhead, Forfar and the remainder sent for incineration (with energy recovery) outside the council area. A recycling centre is at Cairnie Loan and there are a number of neighbourhood recycling facilities. In 2020, Angus Council achieved a 57.9 per cent recycling rate — the highest by any Scottish council — compared with 34.7 per cent for 2007–2008.

Healthcare facilities were developed in the 19th century. In 1836 a dispensary was set up by subscription to give medical care to the poor. In 1842 a typhus epidemic led to a small isolation ward. Arbroath Infirmary, also financed by subscriptions, opened in 1845 and relocated to larger premises in 1916. Medical facilities continue to be provided at Arbroath Infirmary on Rosemount Road by NHS Tayside and further afield at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. The Abbey Health Centre in East Abbey Street and Springfield Medical Centre in Ponderlaw Street provide primary health care. Arbroath, along with the rest of Scotland is served by the Scottish Ambulance Service.

Police Scotland have a police station in Gravesend and the town is served by Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.

A lifeboat station was established in 1803 and was among the first in Scotland. The current RNLI station houses the only remaining Scottish slipway-launched lifeboats. The two lifeboats are an inshore inflatable D-class lifeboat (IB1), the &quot;Robert Ferguson&quot;, and an all-weather Mersey Class, the &quot;Inchcape&quot;.

<doc id="75595" wikidata="Q9299" url="?curid=75595" title="Serbian language">
<text>Serbian (, ) is the standardized variety of the Serbo-Croatian language mainly used by Serbs. It is the official and national language of Serbia, one of the three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina and co-official in Montenegro and Kosovo. It is a recognized minority language in Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.

Standard Serbian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian (more specifically on the dialects of Šumadija-Vojvodina and Eastern Herzegovina), which is also the basis of standard Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin varieties and therefore the Declaration on the Common Language of Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Montenegrins was issued in 2017. The other dialect spoken by Serbs is Torlakian in southeastern Serbia, which is transitional to Macedonian and Bulgarian.

Serbian is practically the only European standard language whose speakers are fully functionally digraphic, using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karadžić, who created it based on phonemic principles. The Latin alphabet used for Serbian () was designed by the Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in the 1830s based on the Czech system with a one-to-one grapheme-phoneme correlation between the Cyrillic and Latin orthographies, resulting in a parallel system.

==Classification==
Serbian is a standardized variety of Serbo-Croatian, a Slavic language (Indo-European), of the South Slavic subgroup. Other standardized forms of Serbo-Croatian are Bosnian, Croatian, and Montenegrin. &quot;An examination of all the major &#x27;levels&#x27; of language shows that BCS is clearly a single language with a single grammatical system.&quot; It has lower intelligibility with the Eastern South Slavic languages Bulgarian and Macedonian, than with Slovene (Slovene is part of the Western South Slavic subgroup, but there are still significant differences in vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation to the standardized forms of Serbo-Croatian, although it is closer to the Kajkavian and Chakavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian).

==Geographic distribution==
Speakers by country:

* Serbia: 6,540,699 (official language)
* Bosnia and Herzegovina: 1,086,027 (co-official language)
* Germany: 568,240
* Austria: 350,000
* Montenegro: 269,307 (language in official use)
* Switzerland: 186,000
* United States: 172,874
* Sweden: 120,000
* Italy: 106,498
*Kosovo: est. 70.000–100.000 (co-official language)
* Canada: 72,690
* Australia: 55,114
* Croatia: 52,879 (recognized minority language)
* Slovenia: 38,964 
* North Macedonia: 24,773 (recognized minority language)
* Romania: 22,518 (recognized minority language)

===Status in Montenegro===
Serbian was the official language of Montenegro until October 2007, when the new Constitution of Montenegro replaced the Constitution of 1992. Amid opposition from pro-Serbian parties, Montenegrin was made the sole official language of the country, and Serbian was given the status of a language in official use along with Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian.

In the 2023 Montenegrin census, 43.18% declared Serbian to be their native language, while Montenegrin was declared by 34.52% of the population.

==Differences between standard Serbian and standard Croatian and Bosnian==


==Writing system==

Standard Serbian language uses both Cyrillic (, ) and Latin script (, ). Serbian is a rare example of synchronic digraphia, a situation where all literate members of a society have two interchangeable writing systems available to them. Media and publishers typically select one alphabet or the other. In general, the alphabets are used interchangeably; except in the legal sphere, where Cyrillic is required, there is no context where one alphabet or another predominates.

Although Serbian language authorities have recognized the official status of both scripts in contemporary Standard Serbian for more than half of a century now, due to historical reasons, the Cyrillic script was made the official script of Serbia&#x27;s administration by the 2006 Constitution.

The Latin script continues to be used in official contexts, although the government has indicated its desire to phase out this practice due to national sentiment. The Ministry of Culture believes that Cyrillic is the &quot;identity script&quot; of the Serbian nation.

However, the law does not regulate scripts in standard language, or standard language itself by any means, leaving the choice of script as a matter of personal preference and to the free will in all aspects of life (publishing, media, trade and commerce, etc.), except in government paperwork production and in official written communication with state officials, which have to be in Cyrillic.
Traffic signs and directional signs, and place names, on main or international roads are to be written with both Cyrillic and Latin script

===Usage===
To most Serbians, the Latin script tends to imply a cosmopolitan or neutral attitude, while Cyrillic appeals to a more traditional or vintage sensibility.

In media, the public broadcaster, Radio Television of Serbia, predominantly uses the Cyrillic script whereas the privately run broadcasters, like RTV Pink, predominantly use the Latin script. Newspapers can be found in both scripts.

In the public sphere, with logos, outdoor signage and retail packaging, the Latin script predominates, although both scripts are commonly seen. The Serbian government has encouraged increasing the use of Cyrillic in these contexts. Larger signs, especially those put up by the government, will often feature both alphabets; if the sign has English on it, then usually only Cyrillic is used for the Serbian text.

A survey from 2014 showed that 47% of the Serbian population favors the Latin alphabet whereas 36% favors the Cyrillic one.

Latin script has become more and more popular in Serbia, as it is easier to input on phones and computers.

===Alphabetic order===

The sort order of the () alphabet:
* Cyrillic order called (): А Б В Г Д Ђ Е Ж З И Ј К Л Љ М Н Њ О П Р С Т Ћ У Ф Х Ц Ч Џ Ш

The sort order of the () alphabet:
* Latin order called (): A B C Č Ć D Dž Đ E F G H I J K L Lj M N Nj O P R S Š T U V Z Ž

== Grammar ==

Serbian is a highly inflected language, with grammatical morphology for nouns, pronouns and adjectives as well as verbs.

=== Nouns ===
Serbian nouns are classified into three declensional types, denoted largely by their nominative case endings as &quot;-a&quot; type, &quot;-i&quot; and &quot;-e&quot; type. Into each of these declensional types may fall nouns of any of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. Each noun may be inflected to represent the noun&#x27;s grammatical case, of which Serbian has seven:

* Nominative
* Genitive
* Dative
* Accusative
* Vocative
* Instrumental
* Locative

Nouns are further inflected to represent the noun&#x27;s number, singular or plural.

=== Pronouns ===
Pronouns, when used, are inflected along the same case and number morphology as nouns. Serbian is a pro-drop language, meaning that pronouns may be omitted from a sentence when their meaning is easily inferred from the text. In cases where pronouns may be dropped, they may also be used to add emphasis. For example:

=== Adjectives ===
Adjectives in Serbian may be placed before or after the noun they modify, but must agree in number, gender and case with the modified noun.

===Verbs===
Serbian verbs are conjugated in four past forms—perfect, aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect—of which the last two have a very limited use (imperfect is still used in some dialects, but the majority of native Serbian speakers consider it archaic), one future tense (also known as the first future tense, as opposed to the second future tense or the future exact, which is considered a tense of the conditional mood by some contemporary linguists), and one present tense. These are the tenses of the indicative mood. Apart from the indicative mood, there is also the imperative mood. The conditional mood has two more tenses: the first conditional (commonly used in conditional clauses, both for possible and impossible conditional clauses) and the second conditional (without use in the spoken language—it should be used for impossible conditional clauses). Serbian has active and passive voice.

As for the non-finite verb forms, Serbian has one infinitive, two adjectival participles (the active and the passive), and two adverbial participles (the present and the past).

==Vocabulary==

Most Serbian words are of native Slavic lexical stock, tracing back to the Proto-Slavic language. There are many loanwords from different languages, reflecting cultural interaction throughout history. Notable loanwords were borrowed from Greek, Latin, Italian, Turkish, Hungarian, English, Russian, German, Czech and French.

==Serbian literature==

Serbian literature emerged in the Middle Ages, and included such works as &quot;Miroslavljevo jevanđelje&quot; (Miroslav&#x27;s Gospel) in 1186 and &quot;Dušanov zakonik&quot; (Dušan&#x27;s Code) in 1349. Little secular medieval literature has been preserved, but what there is shows that it was in accord with its time; for example, the &quot;Serbian Alexandride&quot;, a book about Alexander the Great, and a translation of &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; into Serbian. Although not belonging to the literature proper, the corpus of Serbian literacy in the 14th and 15th centuries contains numerous legal, commercial and administrative texts with marked presence of Serbian vernacular juxtaposed on the matrix of Serbian Church Slavonic.

In the mid-15th century, Serbia was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and for the next 400 years there was no opportunity for the creation of secular written literature. However, some of the greatest literary works in Serbian come from this time, in the form of oral literature, the most notable form being epic poetry. The epic poems were mainly written down in the 19th century, and preserved in oral tradition up to the 1950s, a few centuries or even a millennium longer than by most other &quot;epic folks&quot;. Goethe and Jacob Grimm learned Serbian in order to read Serbian epic poetry in the original. By the end of the 18th century, the written literature had become estranged from the spoken language. In the second half of the 18th century, the new language appeared, called Slavonic-Serbian. This artificial idiom superseded the works of poets and historians like Gavrilo Stefanović Venclović, who wrote in essentially modern Serbian in the 1720s. These vernacular compositions have remained cloistered from the general public and received due attention only with the advent of modern literary historians and writers like Milorad Pavić. In the early 19th century, Vuk Stefanović Karadžić promoted the spoken language of the people as a literary norm.

==Dialects==
The dialects of Serbo-Croatian, regarded Serbian (traditionally spoken in Serbia), include:

* Šumadija–Vojvodina (Ekavian, Neo-Shtokavian): central and northern Serbia
* Eastern Herzegovinian (Ijekavian, Neo-Shtokavian): southwestern Serbia, western half of Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia
* Kosovo–Resava (Ekavian, Old-Shtokavian): eastern central Serbia, central Kosovo
* Smederevo–Vršac (Ekavian, Old-Shtokavian): east-central Serbia
* Prizren–Timok (transitional Torlakian): southeastern Serbia, southern Kosovo
* Zeta–Raška (Ijekavian, Old-Shtokavian): eastern half of Montenegro, southwestern Serbia

==Dictionaries==
Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s &quot;Srpski rječnik&quot;, first published in 1818, is the earliest dictionary of modern literary Serbian. The &quot;Rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika&quot; (I–XXIII), published by the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts from 1880 to 1976, is the only general historical dictionary of Serbo-Croatian. Its first editor was Đuro Daničić, followed by Pero Budmani and the famous Vukovian Tomislav Maretić. The sources of this dictionary are, especially in the first volumes, mainly Štokavian. There are older, pre-standard dictionaries, such as the 1791 German–Serbian dictionary or 15th century Arabic-Persian-Greek-Serbian Conversation Textbook.

===Standard dictionaries===
*&quot;Dictionary of Serbo-Croatian Literary and Vernacular Language&quot; () is the biggest dictionary of Serbian (and Serbo-Croatian as a whole) and still unfinished. Starting in 1959, 21 volumes were published as of 2020 and about 40 are expected by the time it is finished.
* &quot;Dictionary of Serbo-Croatian Literary Language&quot; () in six volumes in 1967–1976, started as a common project of Matica srpska (published in Cyrillic) and Matica hrvatska (published in Latin). Only the first three volumes were published by Matica hrvatska due to negative feedback from Croatian linguists. 
* &quot;Dictionary of the Serbian language&quot; (; ) in one volume, published in 2007 by Matica srpska, which on more than 1500 pages in A4 format explains more than 85,000 entries.

===Etymological dictionaries===
The standard and the only completed etymological dictionary of Serbian is the &quot;Skok&quot;, written by the Croatian linguist Petar Skok: &quot;Etimologijski rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika&quot; (&quot;Etymological Dictionary of Croatian or Serbian&quot;). I-IV. Zagreb 1971–1974.

There is also a new monumental &quot;Etimološki rečnik srpskog jezika&quot; (Etymological Dictionary of Serbian). So far, two volumes have been published: I (with words on A-), and II (Ba-Bd).

There are specialized etymological dictionaries for German, Italian, Croatian, Turkish, Greek, Hungarian, Russian, English and other loanwords (cf. chapter &quot;word origin&quot;).

<doc id="75610" wikidata="Q387664" url="?curid=75610" title="Benjamin Harrison V">
<text>Benjamin Harrison V (April 5, 1726April 24, 1791) was an American planter, merchant, and politician who served as a legislator in colonial Virginia, following his namesakes&#x27; tradition of public service. He was a signer of the Continental Association, as well as the United States Declaration of Independence, and was one of the nation&#x27;s Founding Fathers. He served as Virginia&#x27;s governor from 1781 to 1784.

He was born into the Harrison family of Virginia at their homestead, the Berkeley plantation. He served an aggregate of three decades in the Virginia House of Burgesses, alternately representing Surry County and Charles City County. Harrison was among the early patriots to formally protest measures that King George III and the British Parliament imposed upon the American colonies, leading to the American Revolution. Although a slaveholder, Harrison joined a 1772 petition to the king, requesting that he abolish the slave trade.

As a delegate to the Continental Congress and chair of its Committee of the whole, Harrison attended and presided over the final debate of the Declaration of Independence. He was one of its signers in 1776. The Declaration included a foundational philosophy of the United States: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;

Harrison was elected as Virginia&#x27;s fifth governor; his administration was marked by its futile struggle with a state treasury decimated by the Revolutionary War. He later returned to the Virginia House for two final terms. In disagreement with his traditional ally George Washington, Harrison, in 1788, cast one of his last votes in opposition to the nation&#x27;s Constitution for its lack of a bill of rights. He left two descendants who became United States presidents—son William Henry Harrison and great-grandson Benjamin Harrison.

==Family==

===Parents and siblings===

Harrison was born April 5, 1726, in Charles City County, Virginia; he was the eldest son and 3rd oldest of ten children of Benjamin Harrison IV (1693–1745) and Anne Carter (1702–1743); Anne was a daughter of Robert Carter I. Benjamin Harrison I (1594–1648) arrived in the colonies around 1630 and by 1633 began a family tradition of public service when he was recorded as clerk of the Virginia Governor&#x27;s Council.

Benjamin Harrison II (1645–1712) and Benjamin Harrison III (1673–1710) followed this example, serving as delegates in the Virginia House of Burgesses. Benjamin IV and his wife Anne built the family&#x27;s manor house at Berkeley Plantation; he served as a justice of the peace and represented Charles City County in the Virginia House of Burgesses. (Biographer Clifford Dowdey notes that the family did not employ the roman numeral suffixes, which historians have assigned.)

Benjamin V, in his youth, was &quot;tall and powerfully built,&quot; with &quot;features that were clearly defined, and a well-shaped mouth above a strong pointed chin.&quot; He spent a year or two at the College of William &amp; Mary. His brother Carter Henry (1736–1793) became a leader in Cumberland County. Brother Nathaniel (1742–1782) was elected to the House of Burgesses, then to the Virginia Senate. Brother Henry (1736–1772) fought in the French and Indian War and brother Charles (1740–1793) became a brigadier general in the Continental Army.

===Inheritance and slaveholding===
Harrison&#x27;s father, at age 51 and with a child in hand, was struck by lightning as he shut an upstairs window during a storm on July 12, 1745; he and his daughter Hannah were killed. Benjamin V inherited the bulk of his father&#x27;s estate, including Berkeley and several surrounding plantations, as well as thousands of acres extending to Surry County and the falls of the James River. Also among his holdings was a fishery on the river and a grist mill in Henrico County. He also assumed ownership and responsibility for the manor house&#x27;s equipment, stock, and numerous enslaved people. His siblings inherited another six plantations, possessions, and enslaved people, as the father chose to depart from the tradition of leaving the entire estate to the eldest son.

Harrison and his ancestors enslaved as many as 80 to 100 people. Harrison&#x27;s father was adamant about not breaking up slave families in the distribution of his estate. As with all planters, the Harrisons sustained enslaved people on their plantations. Nevertheless, the enslaved people&#x27;s status was involuntary, and according to Dowdey, &quot;among the worst aspects of their slaveholding is the assumption that the men in the Harrison family, most likely the younger, unmarried ones, and the overseers, made night trips to the slaves&#x27; quarters for carnal purposes.&quot; Benjamin Harrison V owned mulattoes, though no record has been revealed as to their parentage. Dowdey portrays the Harrisons&#x27; further incongruity, saying the enslaved people in some ways &quot;were respected as families, and there developed a sense of duty about indoctrinating them in Christianity, though other slaveholders had reservations about baptizing children who were considered property.&quot;

===Marriage and children===

In 1748, Harrison married Elizabeth Bassett (1730–1792) of New Kent County; she was the daughter of Colonel William Bassett (1709–1744) and Elizabeth Churchill (1709–1779), daughter of burgess William Churchill (1649–1710). Harrison and his wife had eight children during their 40-year marriage. Among them was eldest daughter Lucy Bassett (1749–1809), who married Peyton Randolph (1738–1784). Another daughter, Anne Bassett (1753–1821), married David Coupland (1749–1822). The eldest son was Benjamin Harrison VI (1755–1799), a briefly successful merchant who served in the Virginia House of Delegates but who died a self-indulgent, troubled, young widower. Another was Carter Bassett Harrison (c. 1756–1808), who served in the Virginia House of Delegates and the U.S. House of Representatives. The other children were Elizabeth Harrison (1751–1791), who married a doctor William Rickman (c. 1731–1783) and Sarah Harrison (1770–1812), who married John Minge.

The youngest child was General William Henry Harrison (1773–1841), who became a congressional delegate for the Northwest Territory and also was governor of the Indiana Territory. In the 1840 United States presidential election, William Henry defeated incumbent Martin Van Buren but fell ill and died just one month into his presidency. Vice President John Tyler, a fellow Virginian and Berkeley neighbor succeeded him. William Henry&#x27;s grandson, Benjamin Harrison (1833–1901), was a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Benjamin served in the U.S. Senate and was elected president in 1888 after defeating incumbent Grover Cleveland.

==Virginia delegate==

In 1749, Harrison first took his father&#x27;s path in being elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, initially for Surry County; however, he was not of legal age to assume his burgesses seat, which was delayed until 1752. His county representations in the Burgesses were as follows:

* 1752–1761 – Surry County
* 1766–1781 – Charles City County
* 1785–1786 – Surry County
* 1787–1790 – Charles City County

In his first year in the House of Burgesses in 1752, Harrison was appointed to the Committee of Propositions and Grievances and thereby participated in a confrontation with King George and his Parliament and their appointed Governor of Virginia, Robert Dinwiddie. There developed a dispute with the governor over his levy of a pistole (a Spanish gold coin) upon all land patents, which presaged the core issue of the American Revolution two decades later—taxation without representation. Harrison assisted in drafting a complaint to the governor and the Crown, which read that the payment of any such levy would be &quot;deemed a betrayal of the rights and privileges of the people.&quot; When the British Privy Council received the complaint, it replied: &quot;that the lower house is a subordinate lawmaking body, and where the King&#x27;s decisions are concerned, it counts for nothing.&quot; On this occasion, a compromise was reached, allowing the governor&#x27;s levy on parcels of less than 100 acres lying east of the mountains.

Harrison again joined the fray with Britain after it adopted the Townshend Acts, formally asserting the Parliament&#x27;s right to tax the colonies. He was appointed in 1768 to a special committee to draft a response for the colony. A resolution asserted the right of British subjects to be taxed only by their elected representatives. The American colonies achieved their objective with a repeal of the Townshend Acts through the action of Lord North, who nevertheless continued the tax on tea.

Harrison was a 1770 signer of the Virginia Association, an association of Virginia lawmakers and merchants boycotting British imports until the British Parliament repealed its tea tax. He also sponsored a bill declaring that Parliament&#x27;s laws were illegal without the colonists&#x27; consent. Harrison, at this time, also served as a justice in Charles City County. When the city of Williamsburg lacked the funds for the construction of a courthouse, he and fellow delegate James Littlepage organized a group of &quot;Gentlemen Subscribers&quot; who purchased an unused building and presented it to the city in 1771. Early in 1772, Harrison and Thomas Jefferson were among a group of six Virginia house delegates assigned to prepare and deliver an address to the king which called for an end to the importation of enslaved people from Africa. Biographer Howard Smith indicates that the request was delivered and was unambiguous in its object to close the slave trade; the king rejected it.

==Congressional delegate in Philadelphia==
In 1773, colonists protested the British tax on tea by destroying a shipment during the Boston Tea Party. While all of the colonies were inspired by the news, some patriots, including Harrison, had misgivings and believed the Bostonians had a duty to reimburse the East India Company for its losses at their hands. The British Parliament responded to the protest by enacting more punitive measures, which colonists called the Intolerable Acts. Despite his qualms, Harrison was among 89 members of the Virginia Burgesses who signed a new association on May 24, 1774, condemning Parliament&#x27;s action. The group also invited other colonies to convene a Continental Congress and called for a convention to select its Virginia delegates. At the First Virginia Convention, Harrison was selected on August 5, 1774, as one of seven delegates to represent Virginia at the Congress, to be located in Philadelphia.

Harrison set out that month, leaving his home state for the first time. He was armed with a positive reputation built in the House of Burgesses, which Edmund Randolph articulated to the Congress: &quot;A favorite of the day was Benjamin Harrison. With strong sense and a temper not disposed to compromise with ministerial power, he scruples not to utter any untruth. During a long service in the House of Burgesses, his frankness, though sometimes tinctured with bitterness, has been the source of considerable attachment.&quot;

Harrison arrived in Philadelphia on September 2, 1774, for the First Continental Congress. According to biographer Smith, he gravitated to the older and more conservative delegates in Philadelphia; he was more distant from the New Englanders and the more radical, particularly John and Samuel Adams. The genuine and mutual enmity between the Adams cousins and Harrison also stemmed from their Puritan upbringing in aversion to human pleasures and Harrison&#x27;s appreciation for bold storytelling, fine food, and wine. John Adams described Harrison in his diary as &quot;another Sir John Falstaff,&quot; as &quot;obscene,&quot; &quot;profane,&quot; and &quot;impious.&quot; However, he also recalled Harrison&#x27;s comment that he was so eager to participate in the Congress that &quot;he would have come on foot.&quot; Politically, Harrison aligned with John Hancock and Adams with Richard Henry Lee, whom Harrison had adamantly opposed in the House of Burgesses. Investments and commercial interests of the centrists such as Robert Morris, Thomas Willing, Carter Braxton, and Harrison informed their conservatism.

In October 1774, Harrison signed the Continental Association, an association with the other delegates dictating a boycott of exports and imports with Britain, effective immediately. This was modeled after the Virginia Association, which Harrison had earlier signed in his home state. The First Congress concluded that month with a Petition to the King, signed by all delegates, requesting the king&#x27;s attention to the colonies&#x27; grievances and restoration of harmony with the crown. Upon his return home, Harrison received a letter from Thomas Jefferson advising of his order for 14 sash windows from London just before the passage of the boycott and apologizing for his inability to cancel the order.

In March 1775, Harrison attended a convention at St. John&#x27;s Parish in Richmond, Virginia, made famous by Patrick Henry&#x27;s &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot; speech. A defense resolution was passed by a vote of 65–60 for raising a military force. It represented Virginia&#x27;s substantial step in transitioning from a colony to a commonwealth. Biographer Smith indicates Harrison was probably in the minority, though he was named to a committee to carry the resolution into effect. He was also re-elected as a delegate to the new session of the Continental Congress.

==Second Continental Congress and Declaration of Independence==
When the Second Continental Congress convened in May 1775, Harrison took up residence in north Philadelphia with two roommates—his brother-in-law Peyton Randolph and George Washington. The two men left him to reside alone when Randolph suddenly died, and Washington assumed command of the Continental Army. Harrison was kept busy with the issues of funding and supplying Washington&#x27;s army and corresponded with him at length.

In the spring of 1775, an effort was made in Congress to seek reconciliation with the King of Britain through the Olive Branch Petition, authored by John Dickinson. A heated debate ensued with Dickinson&#x27;s remark that he disapproved of only one word in the petition: &quot;Congress.&quot; Harrison angrily rose from his seat and replied, &quot;There is but one word in the paper, Mr. President, of which I do approve, and that is the word &#x27;Congress.&#x27;&quot; The petition passed and was submitted to the Crown but remained unread by the king as he formally declared that the colonists were traitors.

In November 1775, Harrison was appointed to a select committee to review the army&#x27;s needs. He went to Cambridge, Massachusetts with Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Lynch to assess the needs, as well as the morale, of the forces. After a 10-day inspection, the committee concluded that the pay for the troops should be improved and that the ranks should be increased to over 20,000 men. Harrison then returned to Philadelphia to work closely with fellow delegates for the defense of his state as well as South Carolina, Georgia, and New York.
Harrison attended until the session&#x27;s end in July 1776, frequently serving as chair of the Committee of the Whole. As such, he presided over the final debates of the Lee Resolution offered by Virginia delegate Richard Henry Lee. This was the Congress&#x27; first expression of its objective of freedom from the Crown. Harrison oversaw the final debates and amendments of the Declaration of Independence. The Committee of Five presented Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s draft of the Declaration on June 28, 1776, and the Congress resolved on July 1 that the Committee of the Whole should debate its content. The Committee amended it on July 2 and 3, then adopted it in final form on Thursday, July 4. Harrison duly reported this to Congress and gave a final reading of the Declaration. The Congress unanimously resolved to have the Declaration engrossed and signed by those present.

Harrison was known for his audacious sense of humor. Even detractor John Adams conceded in his diary that &quot;Harrison&#x27;s contributions and many pleasantries steadied rough sessions.&quot; Pennsylvania delegate Benjamin Rush in particular recalled the Congress&#x27; atmosphere during a signing of the Declaration on August 2, 1776. He described a scene of &quot;pensive and awful silence&quot;. He said that Harrison singularly interrupted &quot;the silence and gloom of the morning&quot; as delegates filed forward to inscribe what they thought was their ensuing death warrant. Rush said that the rotund Harrison approached the diminutive Elbridge Gerry, who was about to sign the Declaration, and said, &quot;I shall have a great advantage over you, Mr. Gerry, when we are all hung for what we are now doing. From the size and weight of my body I shall die in a few minutes and be with the Angels, but from the lightness of your body you will dance in the air an hour or two before you are dead.&quot;

==Revolutionary War==

From December 1775 until March 1777, the Congress was on two occasions threatened by British forces and forced to remove itself—first to Baltimore and later to York, Pennsylvania–circumstances that Harrison distinctly disliked. This has been attributed to some unspecified illness he was experiencing then. In 1777, Harrison became a member of the newly created Committee of Secret Correspondence for Congress. The committee&#x27;s primary objective was to establish secure communication with American agents in Britain concerning the colonies&#x27; interests. Harrison was also named as Chairman of the Board of War, whose initial purpose was to review the movements of the army in the north and the exchange of prisoners.

At that time, Harrison found himself at odds with Washington over Marquis de Lafayette&#x27;s commission, which Harrison insisted was honorary only and without pay. He also stirred controversy by endorsing the rights of Quakers not to bear arms per their religion. He unsuccessfully argued throughout the formation of the Articles of Confederation that Virginia should be given greater representation than other states based on its population and land mass. His Congressional membership permanently ended in October 1777; biographer John Sanderson indicates that when Harrison retired from Congress, &quot;his estates had been ravaged&quot; and &quot;his fortune had been impaired.&quot;

Harrison returned to Virginia, where he quickly renewed his efforts in the Virginia legislature. In May 1776, the House of Burgesses had ended and was replaced by the House of Delegates, according to Virginia&#x27;s new constitution. He was elected Speaker in 1777, defeating Thomas Jefferson by a vote of 51–23; he returned to the speakership on several occasions. He concerned himself in the ensuing years with many issues, including Virginia&#x27;s western land interests, the condition of Continental forces, and the defense of the commonwealth.

In January 1781, a British force of 1,600 was positioned at the mouth of the James River, led by turncoat Benedict Arnold; Harrison was called upon to return immediately to Philadelphia to request military support for his state. He knew that Berkeley was one of Arnold&#x27;s primary targets, so he relocated his family before setting out. In Philadelphia, his pleas for Virginia were heard, and he obtained increased gunpowder, supplies, and troops, but only on a delayed basis. Meanwhile, Arnold advanced up the James, wreaking havoc on both sides of the river. The Harrison family avoided capture in Arnold&#x27;s January raid on Berkeley, but Arnold, intent that no likeness of the family survive, removed and burned all the family portraits there. Most of Harrison&#x27;s other possessions and a large portion of the house were destroyed. Other signers were similarly targeted with more horrific consequences. Harrison took up the rehabilitation of his home, returned to his correspondence with Washington, and continued efforts to obtain armaments, troops, and clothing supplies for other southern states.

==Governor of Virginia==

The new nation secured its Revolutionary War victory in October 1781 at Yorktown, Virginia–this provided only brief respite for Harrison, who began to serve a month later as the fifth Governor of Virginia. He was also the fourth governor to assume the office in that year–wartime events in Virginia occasioned multiple successions. Money was the primary problem he confronted, as the war had drained the coffers of the Virginia treasury, and creditors, both domestic and foreign, plagued the government. Hence, there was no capacity for military action outside of the immediate area, so Harrison steadfastly opposed offensive action against combative Indians in the Kentucky and Illinois country. He instead pursued a policy of treating with the Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Creek Indian tribes, which allowed peace to last for the remainder of his term. The situation resulted in some contentious exchanges with General George Rogers Clark who urged aggressive operations in the west.

As Harrison&#x27;s term was ending, Washington accepted an invitation to visit with the Harrisons in Richmond, saying, &quot;And I shall feel an additional pleasure, in offering this tribute of friendship and respect to you, by having the company of Marsqs. de la Fayette&quot;. The general visited in November 1784, though Lafayette could not accompany him. Harrison&#x27;s service as governor was lauded, despite his inability to solve the financial problems that plagued his administration.

==Return to legislature and death==
In 1786, Harrison and other legislature members were deeply divided over the issue of state aid to religion. He joined with his brother and fellow delegate Carter Henry Harrison in supporting a measure offered by Patrick Henry to provide funds for teachers of the Christian religion. The proposal failed, and the assembly enacted Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s famous Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, establishing a separation of church and state.

Harrison participated as a member of the Virginia Ratifying Convention for the United States Constitution in 1788. However, along with Patrick Henry, George Mason, and others, he was skeptical of a large central government and opposed the Constitution because of the absence of a bill of rights. He was in the minority when the constitution won ratification with a margin of 5 out of 170 votes cast. He overcame his ill health sufficiently to address those who opposed the result, imploring them to seek redress through the legitimate channels of amendments to the Constitution. Though Washington had promoted the Constitution, he praised Harrison, saying, &quot;Your individual endeavors to prevent inflammatory measures from being adopted redound greatly to your credit.&quot;

Despite his chronic gout and weakened financial condition, Harrison continued his work in the House, and was a candidate for both Virginia&#x27;s 10th congressional district and Virginia governor in 1788. He died on April 24, 1791, at his home after celebrating re-election. His cause of death is unknown, though his persistent corpulence has been documented. He was buried at his home, along with his wife, Elizabeth Bassett. His son William Henry, aged 18, had just begun medical studies in Philadelphia. Still, adequate funds were lacking, so he soon abandoned medicine for military service and his own path of leadership.

===Legacy===

A residence hall at the College of William &amp; Mary is named for Harrison, as is a primary bridge spanning the James River near Hopewell, Virginia.

Harrison is included in the Washington, D.C. Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence.

<doc id="75619" wikidata="Q963893" url="?curid=75619" title="Ronnie Barker">
<text>Ronald William George Barker (25 September 1929 – 3 October 2005) was an English actor, comedian and writer. He was known for roles in British comedy television series such as &quot;Porridge&quot;, &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, and &quot;Open All Hours&quot;.

Barker began acting in Oxford amateur dramatics while working as a bank clerk, having dropped out of higher education. He moved into repertory theatre with the Manchester Repertory Company at Aylesbury and decided he was best suited to comic roles. He had his first success at the Oxford Playhouse and in roles in the West End including Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Real Inspector Hound&quot;. During this period, he was in the cast of BBC radio and television comedies such as &quot;The Navy Lark&quot;. He got his television break with the satirical sketch series &quot;The Frost Report&quot; in 1966, where he worked with future collaborator Ronnie Corbett. He joined David Frost&#x27;s production company and starred in ITV shows. 

After rejoining the BBC, Barker achieved significant success with the sketch show &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; (1971–87), with Ronnie Corbett. The duo maintained their careers as solo performers; Barker notably starred as inmate Norman Stanley Fletcher in the sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot; (1974–77) and its sequel &quot;Going Straight&quot; (1978) and as shopkeeper Arkwright in &quot;Open All Hours&quot; (1976–85). He wrote comedy under his own name, though for much of his written material after 1968 he adopted pseudonyms (including &quot;Gerald Wiley&quot;) to avoid pre-judgment of his writing talent. He won a BAFTA for best light entertainment performance four times, among other awards, and was appointed an OBE in 1978.

Later television sitcoms such as &quot;The Magnificent Evans&quot; and &quot;Clarence&quot; were less successful and he retired in December 1987. The following year, he opened an antiques shop with his wife, Joy. After 1999, he appeared in smaller, non-comic roles in films. He died of heart failure on 3 October 2005, aged 76.

==Early life==

Barker was born on 25 September 1929 at 70 Garfield Street, Bedford, the only son of Leonard William Barker (always known as &quot;Tim&quot;) and Edith Eleanor (née Carter; known as &quot;Sis&quot;, by virtue of being the youngest sister amongst her siblings).

Barker&#x27;s elder sister Vera was born in 1926 and his younger sister Eileen was born in 1933. His father was a clerk for Shell-Mex, and this job saw the family move to Church Cowley Road in Cowley, Oxfordshire, when Barker was four.

Barker&#x27;s biographer Bob McCabe described Barker&#x27;s childhood as &quot;a happy time, marred by no ructions or family tensions, apart from the occasional wet sock.&quot; As a child, Barker enjoyed dressing up, particularly in his father&#x27;s pierrot outfit, as well as films, comics and animals. He developed a love of the theatre, often attending plays with his family. The first play he saw was &quot;Cottage to Let&quot; and he once skipped school to see Laurence Olivier in &quot;Henry V&quot;. He frequently stood outside stage doors to collect autographs, his first being the actress Celia Johnson.

Barker grew up in the Florence Park area of Oxford, and went to Donnington Junior School, and then the City of Oxford High School for Boys. His chemistry textbook at Oxford had previously been used by T. E. Lawrence. He found his talent for humour at school and developed his musical ability by singing in the choir at St James&#x27;s, his local church. He got into the sixth form a year early after gaining the School Certificate but he felt what he was learning would be of no use to him in later life and so left as soon as he could.

After leaving school, he trained as an architect; however, feeling he was not skilled enough, he quit after six months. Barker took his sister Vera&#x27;s job as a bank clerk at the Westminster Bank after she had left to become a nurse. He harboured dreams of becoming an actor, and took up amateur dramatics, although initially he just saw the pastime as a chance to meet girls.

For 18 months, while at the bank, he worked as an actor and stage manager, making his first appearance in &quot;A Murder Has Been Arranged&quot; as the musical director of the play-within-a-play. Eventually he gave up his job to become a professional actor. His father did not support his acting ambition.

==Career==

===Theatrical career===
Barker failed to get into the Young Vic School, but joined the Manchester Repertory Company, which was based in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, often taking comic roles in their weekly shows. Initially he was employed as the assistant to the assistant stage manager, earning £2.10s. 0d (£2.50) a week. He made his debut as a professional actor on 15 November 1948 as Lieutenant Spicer in a performance of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Quality Street&quot;. He went on to play the organist in &quot;When We Are Married&quot; and by his third role, the chauffeur Charles in &quot;Miranda&quot;, Barker realised he wanted to be a comic actor. He was described as &quot;ha[ving] the talent to be a great straight actor&quot;, but noted: &quot;I want to make people laugh. Never mind about &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Forget &quot;Richard the Second&quot;. Give me &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot;. My mission in life was now crystal clear.&quot; He appeared in stage adaptations of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot; before getting his first leading role in &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot; as a working-class boy at a public school. When the production moved to Rhyl, Barker followed. The Manchester Repertory Company closed, as did the Rhyl company shortly after.

Barker, aged 20, then spent some time as a porter at Wingfield Hospital; he became distressed through his contact with polio patients and so opted to take on the persona of &quot;Charlie&quot; so as not to be himself. He and a male nurse often entertained the patients with comedy routines. He found work at the Mime Theatre Company, performing mimed folk music and dance, which soon folded in Penzance. He made his way back to Oxford and then worked in Bramhall for the Famous Players. There he met actor Glenn Melvyn; the two became firm friends and Barker stated Melvyn taught him everything he &quot;ever learned about comedy&quot;.

He joined the Oxford Playhouse in 1951 and worked there for three years, appearing in plays such as &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot; as Polly. Peter Hall worked with Barker at Oxford and gave him his break, casting him as the Chantyman and Joe Silva in his production of &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; at the Arts Theatre in London&#x27;s West End in 1955. By the time he had made it to the West End, Barker had appeared in an estimated 350 plays.

Barker remained a West End actor for several years, appearing in numerous plays between 1955 and 1968. These included, in 1955, two performances each night as he played a gypsy in &quot;Listen to the Wind&quot; at the Arts Theatre and then a peasant in &quot;Summertime&quot; later in the evening. Other roles included Mr. Thwaites in &quot;Double Image&quot; in 1956 (with Olivier), &quot;Camino Real&quot; (directed by Hall) in 1957, French gangster Robertoles-Diams in &quot;Irma La Douce&quot; for two years from 1958, Lord Slingsby-Craddock in &quot;Mr. Whatnot&quot; in 1964 and Birdboot in &quot;The Real Inspector Hound&quot; in 1968. He also appeared in several Royal Court Theatre productions, including &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; as Quince.

===Early media career===
Barker&#x27;s theatrical success enabled him to move into radio work. Barker, who had previously been known by his full name &quot;Ronald&quot;, was now referred to as the less formal form &quot;Ronnie&quot;, after a director changed it in the credits, although he did not tell Barker. His first radio appearance was in 1956, playing Lord Russett in &quot;Floggit&#x27;s&quot;. He went on to play multiple characters, but primarily the put-upon Able Seaman &quot;Fatso&quot; Johnson and Lieutenant-Commander Stanton in &quot;The Navy Lark&quot;, a navy based sitcom on the BBC Light Programme, which ran from 1959 to 1977, with Barker featuring in some 300 episodes.

He also featured in the show&#x27;s radio spin-off &quot;The TV Lark&quot;, in which his character, Fatso, was now a camera operator after the main characters were drummed out of the service, and as a trainee chef in &quot;Crowther&#x27;s Crowd&quot; in 1963, and had roles on &quot;Variety Playhouse&quot;. Barker soon began working in film and television. His first acting job on television was in Melvyn&#x27;s show &quot;I&#x27;m Not Bothered&quot;. He appeared in various roles in the comedy series &quot;The Seven Faces of Jim&quot; from 1962, alongside Jimmy Edwards and June Whitfield, as well as parts in &quot;Bold as Brass&quot; and &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; (as Russian embassy worker Grischa Petrovitch). This was followed with dramatic parts in &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; as Jerry Cruncher in 1965 as well as a single episode role in &quot;The Avengers&quot;, in which he played Cheshire, a cat lover.

He had an uncredited role in the 1958 film &quot;Wonderful Things!&quot;. In 1964 he appeared in Galton &amp; Simpson&#x27;s gentle comedy &quot;The Bargee,&quot; as &#x27;Ronnie&#x27;, the illiterate cousin of Harry H. Corbett&#x27;s rascally &#x27;Hemmel Pike&#x27;. He did his first bit of on-screen &#x27;porridge&#x27; as fellow convict to Charlie Drake in &quot;The Cracksman&quot; (1963). Other film work at that time included: &quot;Doctor in Distress&quot; (1963), &quot;Father Came Too!&quot; (1963) and &quot;A Home of Your Own&quot; (1965).

In 1966, Barker appeared in &quot;The Saint (S5, E9 &quot;The Better Mousetrap&quot;)&quot; as the detective Alphonse. In 1966, Barker got his break with the satirical sketch series &quot;The Frost Report&quot;, having been recommended for the show by producer James Gilbert. The show starred David Frost, John Cleese and Barker&#x27;s future comedy partner Ronnie Corbett, whom he had met in 1963 when Corbett was the barman at the Buckstone Club near the Haymarket Theatre. Corbett stated in his autobiography that the two had gravitated towards each other because of their similar backgrounds; neither had attended university, while many of the other cast and writers on &quot;The Frost Report&quot; had. Each episode of the show, which was performed and broadcast live, focused on a single topic and principally revolved around a continuous monologue from Frost, with sketches from Barker, Corbett and Cleese as the show went on. Barker starred alongside Cleese and Corbett in &quot;The Frost Report&quot;″s best-known sketch, which satirised the British class system, with Barker representing the middle class.

After the first series, the special &quot;Frost Over England&quot; was produced, winning the Golden Rose at the Montreux Television Festival. With a second series of the show announced, Frost, recognising their potential, signed both Barker and Corbett up to his production company David Paradine Productions. As part of the deal Barker was given his own show in 1968, &quot;The Ronnie Barker Playhouse&quot;, which comprised six separate, thirty-minute plays. Barker starred in each piece as a different character. After two series of &quot;The Frost Report&quot; on the BBC, totalling 26 half-hour episodes, Frost moved to ITV after helping to set up London Weekend Television. There, Frost hosted &quot;Frost on Sunday&quot;, with Barker and Corbett following and again performing sketches on the programme. Barker began writing sketches for the programme under the pseudonym Gerald Wiley. Barker and Corbett had a greater role on the show than on &quot;The Frost Report&quot; and Corbett felt &quot;more aware of what [they] were doing.&quot;

Barker began using the pseudonym Gerald Wiley when writing sketches because he wished the pieces to be accepted on merit and not just because he, as a star of the programme, had written them; he continued this tradition with the material he wrote later in his career, using a variety of pseudonyms. Barker brought his sketches in, claiming they had come from Wiley through Barker&#x27;s agent Peter Eade, and they were very well received. To maintain the deception, Barker had criticised material he himself had submitted under the pseudonym; when a Wiley-credited sketch about a ventriloquist had been poorly received by the audience Barker told Corbett &quot;Well, Gerald Wiley let us down there&quot;, and on another occasion, when looking at a script, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand this line. What&#x27;s he getting at?&quot; One of the first sketches he wrote was called &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Waiting Room&quot;, with the main part written for Corbett. Barker encouraged Corbett to buy the rights to the sketch and, further maintaining the myth, told him to reject Wiley&#x27;s &quot;request&quot; for £3,000 as too expensive, before giving Corbett the sketch for free. Speculation began about Wiley&#x27;s identity, with Tom Stoppard, Frank Muir, Alan Bennett and Noël Coward all rumoured. After the second series of &quot;Frost on Sunday&quot;, the cast and crew were invited to a Chinese restaurant, while Wiley said that he would reveal himself. Barker, who had told Corbett earlier in the day, stood up and announced he was Wiley, although initially nobody believed him. In 1969, Barker was able to write, produce and star as Sir Giles Futtock in the film &quot;Futtock&#x27;s End&quot; which featured little dialogue and only &quot;grumble[s] and grunt[s]&quot;. 

&quot;The Ronnie Barker Playhouse&quot; had been designed to find a successful idea for a sitcom, and the episode &quot;Ah, There You Are&quot; by Alun Owen, which introduced the bumbling aristocratic character Lord Rustless, was chosen. Despite Barker&#x27;s success on ITV, LWT&#x27;s programme controller Stella Richman opted to fire Frost&#x27;s company Paradine (Frost was sacked from the LWT board) and as Barker was contracted to the company rather than the network, he lost his job, as did Corbett.

===Move to the BBC and &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;===
Soon after, Barker, Corbett and Josephine Tewson performed a sketch about Henry VIII at the 1971 BAFTAs, with Barker playing Henry. The three also had to keep the audience entertained for around eight minutes as the show was stopped because of technical difficulties. Their performance at the award show impressed the BBC&#x27;s Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton and Controller of BBC1, Paul Fox, who were sitting in the audience. Not knowing they were both essentially unemployed, although still contracted to Paradine, Cotton signed the duo up for their own show together, and a series each on their own; he later joked he &quot;must have offered them too much money.&quot; Barker and Corbett wished to avoid being remembered primarily as a duo, and felt they could not work in the same way as a conventional double act like Morecambe and Wise, and so each maintained their solo careers as well. They each were given a one-off variety special; Barker&#x27;s, called &quot;The Ronnie Barker Yearbook&quot;, featured a sketch for each month of the year although, because of time constraints, the first two had to be cut. Barker also reprised his character Lord Rustless in the sitcom &quot;His Lordship Entertains&quot; in 1972. Barker wrote all seven episodes, now using the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald.

Their show together was &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, a sketch show which aired for twelve series and eight specials between 1971 and 1987, to immediate success. The show, as described by Anthony Hayward of &quot;The Independent&quot;, was &quot;a cocktail of comedy sketches, playlets, songs and parodies, a long-winded Corbett monologue and a singing star, sandwiched between the opening and closing news summaries.&quot; The usual format consisted of many sketches between the two, an ongoing filmed serial, a solo character sketch from Barker, Corbett&#x27;s monologue, a musical number, a special guest, bookended by joke news items, delivered from a desk by the two in the style of newsreaders, before ending with the catchphrase &quot;It&#x27;s good night from me – and it&#x27;s good night from him.&quot;

This was a set format which was used for almost the entirety of the show&#x27;s run. The end catchphrase and newsreader characters were devised because Barker found it difficult to appear as himself: Corbett explained that Barker &quot;was a very private man, a quiet man ... He found it almost impossible to talk directly, as himself, to an audience.&quot; Each also had their own solo segments to help ensure they were not totally associated as a double act. Filming took place over four months of each year. After outdoor and serial sketches were filmed on location, the studio material was filmed on Sunday evenings at BBC Television Centre in front of a live audience; the musical finale was filmed the day before without the audience.

Barker wrote much of the show&#x27;s material, roughly three-quarters, again under the name Gerald Wiley. He was heavily involved with the show&#x27;s production, especially the serial. Corbett explained that Barker was a &quot;perfectionist&quot; and &quot;as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look.&quot; After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin to edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look through all of the potential material for the studio recording of the rest of the show&#x27;s content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting &quot;People refuse to believe that we don&#x27;t have rows, tensions, private wars. It&#x27;s a strange thing after so many years but we never have. Actually, it&#x27;s even more amicable than a marriage – wedlock without the bad patches. Our sense of humour and perception of what&#x27;s good and what&#x27;s rubbish are uncommonly in tune.&quot; They took turns to play the parts which had the &quot;good lines&quot;. One of the show&#x27;s other writers, Barry Cryer, said: &quot;You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they weren&#x27;t a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers.&quot;

Barker&#x27;s material included the sketch which came to be known as &quot;Four Candles&quot;, airing in 1976, although in the original script it was titled &quot;Annie Finkhouse&quot;. It sees a customer (Barker) ask for a series of items in a hardware store. The sketch&#x27;s humour derives from similarities in word pronunciation, leading to confusion on the part of the store owner (Corbett). These misunderstandings include the confusion between &quot;four candles&quot; and &quot;fork handles&quot;. The idea for the sketch came from the owners of a hardware shop in Hayes who wrote in to &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; to describe some of the amusing events and misunderstandings in their store. Barker was never happy with the sketch&#x27;s final line (a male assistant asking &quot;What sort of billhooks did you want?&quot;) and changed it (to a female assistant asking &quot;What sort of knockers were you looking for?&quot;) for the stage version of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, although he was still not totally satisfied with it. Nevertheless, the sketch is considered the show&#x27;s most famous one and was voted as the show&#x27;s best in a TV special, while also placing fifth on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Comedy Sketches&quot;. The original script, handwritten by Barker, was sold for £48,500 at auction in 2007 after featuring in an episode of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; the previous year.

The show was considered a &quot;national institution&quot; with audiences of between 15 and 20 million regularly tuning in to its 93 episodes. Barker won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1971 and 1977 for the show. &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; ended with the 1987 Christmas special. In 1978 the two performed a stage version of the show at the London Palladium; lasting for three months, it followed the same format as the show, with old sketches and some new material, supported by variety acts. Barker&#x27;s unease with appearing as himself in the stage show led him to create a fictionalised version of himself to play instead. A second stage series took place in 1983. Barker was reportedly offended by a sketch called &quot;The Two Ninnies&quot; on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, which mocked their act as being based on dated innuendo-based humour.

After a tip-off from Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, Barker and Corbett opted to move with their families to Sydney, Australia, in 1979 for the year to exploit a tax loophole and avoid paying the year&#x27;s income tax. They performed their stage show for four weeks in Sydney and a further four in Melbourne; because of their existing popularity in Australia and what Corbett termed the Australian audiences&#x27; &quot;[comedic] soul that still related to the UK&quot;, they made no changes to the routine. Barker made no other appearances that year and spent his time writing and engaging in recreational activities. Following the show&#x27;s success, Kerry Packer commissioned a six-episode TV series of &quot;The Two Ronnies in Australia&quot; for Nine Network. The show comprised material not yet shown in Australia from &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; and new content targeted more towards an Australian audience. They returned for a second series in 1986.

Barker and Corbett also starred in the short, mostly silent, films &quot;The Picnic&quot; (1976) and &quot;By the Sea&quot; (1982), both written by Barker as &quot;David Huggett and Larry Keith&quot;. &quot;By the Sea&quot; was Barker&#x27;s tribute to the seaside-postcard humour of Donald McGill and his most &quot;personal&quot; work. The show was also widely syndicated in North America by PBS and CBC, and in 1980 they appeared in the short-lived NBC variety show &quot;The Big Show&quot;; the two were glad the show did not last as they objected to the use of canned laughter by the American networks.

===&quot;Porridge&quot;, &quot;Open All Hours&quot; and other work===
Following the success of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, the BBC let Barker decide what he wanted to do. &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; took up one third of a year to produce, allowing time for Barker and Corbett to do a solo project each. Barker opted to produce some sitcom pilots shown as part of 1973&#x27;s &quot;Seven of One&quot;. Two of these pilots, &quot;Open All Hours&quot; (written by Roy Clarke) and &quot;Prisoner and Escort&quot; (written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) became series. &quot;Prisoner and Escort&quot; became &quot;Porridge&quot;, airing from 1974 to 1977, with Barker starring as the cynical and cunning prisoner Norman Stanley Fletcher. &quot;Porridge&quot; was the first sitcom to take place in a prison; &quot;The Times&quot; said the show &quot;was about what it took to survive in prison, the little day-to-day triumphs over the system that kept the prisoners sane.&quot;

The opening sequence of the programme showed Fletcher being directed to his cell, as prison doors are locked behind him, all the while the judge can be heard pronouncing judgement and sentence. The judge&#x27;s voice was performed by Barker. The show became a huge success, attracting 15 million viewers and earning what the BBC described as &quot;a chorus of critical acclaim and public adoration for what remains one of the most classic British sitcoms ever produced.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; called Fletcher his &quot;finest creation&quot;. Barker privately regarded the series as the finest work of his career. He won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1975 for his performance.

In 1976, Barker played Friar Tuck in the film &quot;Robin and Marian&quot;, directed by Richard Lester. The same year, determined not to be remembered only as Fletcher, Barker opted to end &quot;Porridge&quot; after three series and instead focused on the second pilot &quot;Open All Hours&quot;, alongside David Jason. Barker starred as Arkwright, a money-grabbing, stuttering shopkeeper. Arkwright&#x27;s stutter was not in the script; Barker was inspired to use it by Melvyn&#x27;s performance and use of a stutter in a 1955 play the two performed at the Palace Theatre called &quot;Hot Water&quot;. &quot;Open All Hours&quot; aired one series in 1976 on BBC2 but was not renewed due to low ratings. As a result, Barker backtracked on his earlier decision and produced a third series of &quot;Porridge&quot;, as well as a film adaptation. It was followed by the spin-off sitcom &quot;Going Straight&quot; which focused on Fletcher after his release from prison. While not as popular as &quot;Porridge&quot;, Barker again won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance.

Further plans for the show were ended when Barker&#x27;s co-star Richard Beckinsale died of a heart attack in 1979, aged 31. With repeats of &quot;Open All Hours&quot; earning high ratings on BBC1, the BBC commissioned a further series of the show in 1981, with another two made as well as the show continued its ratings success. Both shows placed in the top ten of the 2004 poll to determine Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom; &quot;Porridge&quot; finished seventh and &quot;Open All Hours&quot; eighth.

Barker was the first actor originally considered for the role of Frank Spencer in &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;. However, he turned the role down and it went to Michael Crawford.

Barker&#x27;s next sitcom, &quot;The Magnificent Evans&quot;, which was about a Welsh photographer and aired in 1984, was not successful. His final sitcom, &quot;Clarence&quot;, in which he played Clarence Sale, a removal man with failing sight, aired in 1988. Barker wrote the show himself, again using a pseudonym, this time as &quot;Bob Ferris&quot;.

===Retirement and re-appearances===

In 1987, before &quot;Clarence&quot; aired and after rejecting Hall&#x27;s offer of the part of Falstaff in a Royal National Theatre production of &quot;Henry IV, Part 1 &amp; 2&quot;, Barker retired from show business, aged 58, &quot;at the height of his fame&quot;, citing a decline in his own writing quality, lack of ambition and ideas, and a desire to go out on top so as not to damage his legacy, as well as concerns about the state of his heart. He had decided to retire in 1985 but his decision was kept secret for two years, Corbett being the only one knowing about it. He made his decision public on an appearance on the chat show &quot;Wogan&quot;.

Retired, Barker opened and ran an antiques shop called The Emporium in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, and resisted all calls to come out of retirement from then onwards. He joked: &quot;I lose money every week, but it&#x27;s a hobby. It&#x27;s cheaper than skiing and safer at my age.&quot; Because of its unprofitability, the shop was sold after ten years. He wrote his autobiography, &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight: My Early Years on Stage&quot;, in 1993 and released &quot;All I Ever Wrote&quot;, his complete scripts, in 1999. He wrote the play &quot;Mum&quot; (initially as &quot;Richard Mervyn&quot;, but as the play was opening, consenting to use his own name) for his daughter Charlotte in 1998. The play was performed at The King&#x27;s Head Theatre, but garnered a negative response, with Barker stating it got &quot;the worst notices of any play in the history of the theatre.&quot;

Just over a decade after retiring, Barker was persuaded to make occasional appearances on television again. In 1997 he appeared with Corbett at the Royal Command Performance, driving on stage on a motorcycle combination as the Two Fat Ladies, and in 1999 he was reunited with Corbett for &quot;Two Ronnies Night&quot; on BBC One, and the following year for &quot;A Tribute to the Two Ronnies&quot;. In 2002, director Richard Loncraine persuaded Barker to appear as Winston Churchill&#x27;s butler David Inches in the BBC-HBO drama &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; and then cast him in the larger role of the General in the TV film &quot;My House in Umbria&quot; in 2003, alongside Maggie Smith (whom Barker had advised, early in their careers, to give up acting as he felt she would not be a success). In the same year, he briefly reprised his role as Norman Stanley Fletcher in the spoof documentary &quot;Life Beyond the Box&quot;.

Barker received several lifetime achievement awards. He won the Royal Television Society&#x27;s award for Outstanding Creative Achievement in 1975. Sir Alec Guinness presented him with a lifetime achievement honour at the inaugural British Comedy Awards in 1990, while he received another such honour at the BBC Centenary Programme in 1996. In 2004 he was given a special BAFTA lifetime achievement award at &quot;Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute&quot;, a televised celebratory tribute evening. In 2005, he and Corbett were part of the first 100 people given stars on London&#x27;s Avenue of Stars. Previous awards included the Variety Club of Great Britain Award in 1969, 1974 and 1980, the Radio Industry Club Award in 1973, 1974, 1977 and 1981.

Following the success of &quot;Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute&quot;, Barker wanted to return &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; to television and the BBC commissioned &quot;The Two Ronnies Sketchbook&quot;, a clip show of their best sketches along with newly recorded introductions. These were recorded in one day because of Barker&#x27;s declining health and aired in 2005. The project, when announced, met with &quot;some derision among the professional critics&quot;, but after the first episode drew eight million viewers, they had to &quot;eat their words&quot;. The final special, and Barker&#x27;s final appearance on television – &quot;The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook&quot; – was recorded in July 2005 as a result of Barker&#x27;s failing health and aired posthumously in December.

==Acting and writing style==

Barker became a comic actor in his theatre days, noting &quot;I think it&#x27;s better to make people laugh than cry.&quot; He has been described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;not a comedian, [but] an actor with a talent for comedy,&quot; who &quot;slipped into characters with apparent ease.&quot; Barker felt he was funny only in character. The BBC wrote of him: &quot;Able to deliver the great tongue-twisting speeches required of his characters, Barker pronounced himself &#x27;completely boring&#x27; without a script.&quot; Peter Hall spoke of Barker&#x27;s skills as a dramatic actor, calling him &quot;the great actor we lost&quot; and lamented that Barker was unable to take a role in one of his Shakespearean productions. Barker, though, preferred comedy, and felt it was &quot;as good and as important as serious work&quot; and he was not &quot;dumbing down&quot; by doing it. Actor Gene Wilder compared him to Charlie Chaplin in saying &quot;no matter how farcical [his performance] was ... there was always an element of reality to what he did.&quot; Corbett praised Barker&#x27;s skill at playing serious authority figures saying absurd things, using Barker&#x27;s verbal dexterity and energetic performances.

Barker&#x27;s writing style was, for &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;based on precise scripts and perfect timing.&quot; It often involved playing with language, including humour involving such linguistic items as spoonerisms and double entendres. Dennis Baker of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Barker &quot;preferred innuendo over the crudely explicit, a restraint that demanded some imagination from the audience and was the essence of his comedy.&quot; Corbett said he had &quot;a mastery of the English language&quot;.

In private, he annotated a copy of &quot;A Book of Nonsense&quot; by Edward Lear, penning punch lines of his own for each limerick. On the title page he wrote, &quot;There was an old fossil named Lear, Whose verses were boring and drear. His last lines were worst – just the same as the first! So I&#x27;ve tried to improve on them here.&quot; The annotated copy of Lear&#x27;s book, signed and dated November 2001, was auctioned in 2012.

==Personal life==

Barker met Joy Tubb in Cambridge while she was a stage manager for two plays he was in. They married nine months later in July 1957 and had three children: two sons, Larry (born 1959) and Adam (born 1968), and one daughter, Charlotte (born 1962), who became an actress. Larry, a leading advertising creative director, was named after Barker&#x27;s idol Laurence Olivier. Adam Barker became an actor, but was jailed for twelve months in 2012 on twenty counts of making indecent images of children, having evaded police for eight years; he was not present at his father&#x27;s funeral.
The family lived in Pinner for many years, and subsequently in a converted mill in Dean, Oxfordshire. According to Corbett, Barker was &quot;first and foremost a family man&quot;. Joy died in January 2011, aged 78.

Barker was appointed an OBE in 1978. He was an avid collector of antiques, books and posters and amassed a collection of over 53,000 postcards. He produced several compilation books of them, including &quot;Ronnie Barker&#x27;s Book of Bathing Beauties&quot;, &quot;A Pennyworth of Art&quot;, and &quot;Sauce&quot;. Barker rarely appeared in public, and when he did, it was almost always in character. He once said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always known I haven&#x27;t a personality of my own, I have to be someone else to be happy. That&#x27;s why I became an actor, I suppose.&quot;

Barker was a heavy smoker until 1972, when he gave up the habit after having a pre-cancerous growth removed from his throat; he took to drinking wine and using placebo cigarettes to maintain his concentration and help him sleep. He underwent a heart bypass in 1996 and survived a pulmonary embolism the following year.

==Death==
Barker opted not to have heart valve replacement surgery, and his health rapidly declined after the recording of &quot;The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook&quot;. He died of heart failure at the Katherine House hospice in Adderbury, Oxfordshire, on 3 October 2005, aged 76, with his wife by his side. News of his death made top billing on television news bulletins.

Barker&#x27;s body was cremated at a private humanist funeral at Banbury Crematorium, which was attended only by family and close friends. A public memorial service for Barker was held on 3 March 2006 at Westminster Abbey, with some 2,000 people in attendance. Ronnie Corbett, Richard Briers, Josephine Tewson, Michael Grade, and Peter Kay all read at the service, while others in attendance included David Jason, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin, Leslie Phillips, Lenny Henry, Dawn French, June Whitfield and David Frost. A recording of Barker&#x27;s rhyming slang sermon from &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; was played, and while the cross was in procession in the aisle of the abbey, it was accompanied by four candles instead of the usual two, in reference to the Four Candles sketch. Barker was the third comedy professional to be given a memorial at Westminster Abbey, after Joyce Grenfell and Les Dawson.

===Legacy===

Following his death, the Writer of the Year Award at the British Comedy Awards was renamed in his honour. In 2005, he was voted as the 16th greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders, in a poll to find &quot;The Comedians&#x27; Comedian&quot;.

The BBC described him as &quot;one of the leading figures of British television comedy&quot;, and &quot;much loved and admired&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; called him &quot;a master of television sitcom&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said he was &quot;much loved ... both as an actor and a writer he was recognised as a master of pyrotechnic puns, surreal behaviour in public and private places, and crackling cross-chat&quot;. It concluded that &quot;it says much about the decline of the British television industry that Ronnie Barker, one of its most creative comic talents, should have turned his back on it long before he died at the age of 76.&quot; In a eulogy for Barker, the Reverend Robert Wright stated that he was &quot;undoubtedly one of the very greatest television comedy actors&quot; and that &quot;as a performer he made comedy look effortlessly funny&quot;.

In 2006, Barker&#x27;s stage play &quot;Mum&quot; was adapted and directed by Neil Cargill for BBC Radio 4, and broadcast as an &quot;Afternoon Play&quot;, starring Maxine Peake and Sam Kelly.

A bronze statue of Barker, sculpted by Martin Jennings and showing him in character as Norman Stanley Fletcher, was unveiled at the entrance of the Aylesbury Waterside Theatre in September 2010 by his widow Joy, David Jason and Ronnie Corbett.

In 2015, the Ronnie Barker Comedy Lecture (also referred to as The Ronnie Barker Talk) was commissioned by the BBC at the instigation of the head of comedy commissioning, Shane Allen. The first lecture was given in August 2017 by Ben Elton. Elton&#x27;s lecture focused on the future of the British sitcom.

<doc id="75624" wikidata="Q333373" url="?curid=75624" title="Abstract syntax">
<text>In computer science, the abstract syntax of data is its structure described as a data type (possibly, but not necessarily, an abstract data type), independent of any particular representation or encoding. This is particularly used in the representation of text in computer languages, which are generally stored in a tree structure as an abstract syntax tree. Abstract syntax, which only consists of the structure of data, is contrasted with concrete syntax, which also includes information about the representation. For example, concrete syntax includes features like parentheses (for grouping) or commas (for lists), which are not included in the abstract syntax, as they are implicit in the structure.

Abstract syntaxes are classified as first-order abstract syntax (FOAS), if the structure is abstract but names (identifiers) are still concrete (and thus requires name resolution), and &quot;higher-order abstract syntax,&quot; if the names themselves are abstract.

==Uses==
To be implemented either for computation or communications, a mapping from the abstract syntax to specific machine representations and encodings must be defined; these may be called the &quot;concrete syntax&quot; (in language implementation) or the &quot;transfer syntax&quot; (in communications).

A compiler&#x27;s internal representation of a program will typically be specified by an abstract syntax in terms of categories such as &quot;statement&quot;, &quot;expression&quot; and &quot;identifier&quot;. This is independent of the source syntax (concrete syntax) of the language being compiled (though it will often be very similar). A parse tree is similar to an abstract syntax tree but it will typically also contain features such as parentheses, which are syntactically significant but which are implicit in the structure of the abstract syntax tree.

Algebraic data types are particularly well-suited to the implementation of abstract syntax.

<doc id="75625" wikidata="Q333301" url="?curid=75625" title="ASN.1">
<text>Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard interface description language (IDL) for defining data structures that can be serialized and deserialized in a cross-platform way. It is broadly used in telecommunications and computer networking, and especially in cryptography.

Protocol developers define data structures in ASN.1 modules, which are generally a section of a broader standards document written in the ASN.1 language. The advantage is that the ASN.1 description of the data encoding is independent of a particular computer or programming language. Because ASN.1 is both human-readable and machine-readable, an ASN.1 compiler can compile modules into libraries of code, codecs, that decode or encode the data structures. Some ASN.1 compilers can produce code to encode or decode several encodings, e.g. packed, BER or XML.

ASN.1 is a joint standard of the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) in ITU-T Study Group 17 and International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC), originally defined in 1984 as part of CCITT X.409:1984. In 1988, ASN.1 moved to its own standard, X.208, due to wide applicability. The substantially revised 1995 version is covered by the X.680 series. The latest revision of the X.680 series of recommendations is the 6.0 Edition, published in 2021.

== Language support ==
ASN.1 is a data type declaration notation. It does not define how to manipulate a variable of such a type. Manipulation of variables is defined in other languages such as SDL (Specification and Description Language) for executable modeling or TTCN-3 (Testing and Test Control Notation) for conformance testing. Both these languages natively support ASN.1 declarations. It is possible to import an ASN.1 module and declare a variable of any of the ASN.1 types declared in the module.

== Applications ==
ASN.1 is used to define a large number of protocols. Its most extensive uses continue to be telecommunications, cryptography, and biometrics.

== Encodings ==
ASN.1 is closely associated with a set of encoding rules that specify how to represent a data structure as a series of bytes. The standard ASN.1 encoding rules include:
===Encoding Control Notation===
ASN.1 recommendations provide a number of predefined encoding rules. If none of the existing encoding rules are suitable, the Encoding Control Notation (ECN) provides a way for a user to define his or her own customized encoding rules.

=== Relation to Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) Encoding ===
Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) encoding is entirely unrelated to ASN.1 and its codecs, but encoded ASN.1 data, which is often binary, is often PEM-encoded so that it can be transmitted as textual data, e.g. over SMTP relays, or through copy/paste buffers.

==Example==
This is an example ASN.1 module defining the messages (data structures) of a fictitious Foo Protocol:
FooProtocol DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

 FooQuestion ::= SEQUENCE {
 trackingNumber INTEGER,
 question IA5String

 FooAnswer ::= SEQUENCE {
 questionNumber INTEGER,
 answer BOOLEAN

END
This could be a specification published by creators of Foo Protocol. Conversation flows, transaction interchanges, and states are not defined in ASN.1, but are left to other notations and textual description of the protocol.

Assuming a message that complies with the Foo Protocol and that will be sent to the receiving party, this particular message (protocol data unit (PDU)) is:
myQuestion FooQuestion ::= {
 trackingNumber 5,
 question &quot;Anybody there?&quot;


ASN.1 supports constraints on values and sizes, and extensibility. The above specification can be changed to
FooProtocol DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

 FooQuestion ::= SEQUENCE {
 trackingNumber INTEGER(0..199),
 question IA5String

 FooAnswer ::= SEQUENCE {
 questionNumber INTEGER(10..20),
 answer BOOLEAN

 FooHistory ::= SEQUENCE {
 questions SEQUENCE(SIZE(0..10)) OF FooQuestion,
 answers SEQUENCE(SIZE(1..10)) OF FooAnswer,
 anArray SEQUENCE(SIZE(100)) OF INTEGER(0..1000),
 }

END
This change constrains trackingNumbers to have a value between 0 and 199 inclusive, and questionNumbers to have a value between 10 and 20 inclusive. The size of the questions array can be between 0 and 10 elements, with the answers array between 1 and 10 elements. The anArray field is a fixed length 100 element array of integers that must be in the range 0 to 1000. The &#x27;...&#x27; extensibility marker means that the FooHistory message specification may have additional fields in future versions of the specification; systems compliant with one version should be able to receive and transmit transactions from a later version, though able to process only the fields specified in the earlier version. Good ASN.1 compilers will generate (in C, C++, Java, etc.) source code that will automatically check that transactions fall within these constraints. Transactions that violate the constraints should not be accepted from, or presented to, the application. Constraint management in this layer significantly simplifies protocol specification because the applications will be protected from constraint violations, reducing risk and cost.

To send the myQuestion message through the network, the message is serialized (encoded) as a series of bytes using one of the encoding rules. The Foo protocol specification should explicitly name one set of encoding rules to use, so that users of the Foo protocol know which one they should use and expect.

===Example encoded in DER===
Below is the data structure shown above as myQuestion encoded in DER format (all numbers are in hexadecimal):

 30 13 02 01 05 16 0e 41 6e 79 62 6f 64 79 20 74 68 65 72 65 3f
DER is a type–length–value encoding, so the sequence above can be interpreted, with reference to the standard SEQUENCE, INTEGER, and IA5String types, as follows:

 30 — type tag indicating SEQUENCE
 13 — length in octets of value that follows
 02 — type tag indicating INTEGER
 01 — length in octets of value that follows
 05 — value (5)
 16 — type tag indicating IA5String 
 (IA5 means the full 7-bit ISO 646 set, including variants, 
 but is generally US-ASCII)
 0e — length in octets of value that follows
 41 6e 79 62 6f 64 79 20 74 68 65 72 65 3f — value (&quot;Anybody there?&quot;)

===Example encoded in XER===
Alternatively, it is possible to encode the same ASN.1 data structure with XML Encoding Rules (XER) to achieve greater human readability &quot;over the wire&quot;. It would then appear as the following 108 octets, (space count includes the spaces used for indentation):
&lt;FooQuestion&gt;
 &lt;trackingNumber&gt;5&lt;/trackingNumber&gt;
 &lt;question&gt;Anybody there?&lt;/question&gt;
&lt;/FooQuestion&gt;
===Example encoded in PER (unaligned)===
Alternatively, if Packed Encoding Rules are employed, the following 122 bits (16 octets amount to 128 bits, but here only 122 bits carry information and the last 6 bits are merely padding) will be produced:

 01 05 0e 83 bb ce 2d f9 3c a0 e9 a3 2f 2c af c0

In this format, type tags for the required elements are not encoded, so it cannot be parsed without knowing the expected schemas used to encode. Additionally, the bytes for the value of the IA5String are packed using 7-bit units instead of 8-bit units, because the encoder knows that encoding an IA5String byte value requires only 7 bits. However the length bytes are still encoded here, even for the first integer tag 01 (but a PER packer could also omit it if it knows that the allowed value range fits on 8 bits, and it could even compact the single value byte 05 with less than 8 bits, if it knows that allowed values can only fit in a smaller range).

The last 6 bits in the encoded PER are padded with null bits in the 6 least significant bits of the last byte c0 : these extra bits may not be transmitted or used for encoding something else if this sequence is inserted as a part of a longer unaligned PER sequence.

This means that unaligned PER data is essentially an ordered stream of bits, and not an ordered stream of bytes like with aligned PER, and that it will be a bit more complex to decode by software on usual processors because it will require additional contextual bit-shifting and masking and not direct byte addressing (but the same remark would be true with modern processors and memory/storage units whose minimum addressable unit is larger than 1 octet). However modern processors and signal processors include hardware support for fast internal decoding of bit streams with automatic handling of computing units that are crossing the boundaries of addressable storage units (this is needed for efficient processing in data codecs for compression/decompression or with some encryption/decryption algorithms).

If alignment on octet boundaries was required, an aligned PER encoder would produce:

 01 05 0e 41 6e 79 62 6f 64 79 20 74 68 65 72 65 3f

(in this case, each octet is padded individually with null bits on their unused most significant bits).

== Tools ==
Most of the tools supporting ASN.1 do the following:
* parse the ASN.1 files,
* generates the equivalent declaration in a programming language (like C or C++),
* generates the encoding and decoding functions based on the previous declarations.

A list of tools supporting ASN.1 can be found on the ITU-T Tool web page.

=== Online tools ===

* ASN1 Play
* ASN1 Web Tool (very limited)
* ASN1 Playground (sandbox)
* ASN.1 JavaScript decoder

== Comparison to similar schemes ==
ASN.1 is similar in purpose and use to Google Protocol Buffers and Apache Thrift, which are also interface description languages for cross-platform data serialization. Like those languages, it has a schema (in ASN.1, called a &quot;module&quot;), and a set of encodings, typically type–length–value encodings. Unlike them, ASN.1 does not provide a single and readily usable open-source implementation, and is published as a specification to be implemented by third-party vendors. However, ASN.1, defined in 1984, predates them by many years. It also includes a wider variety of basic data types, some of which are obsolete, and has more options for extensibility. A single ASN.1 message can include data from multiple modules defined in multiple standards, even standards defined years apart.

ASN.1 also includes built-in support for constraints on values and sizes. For instance, a module can specify an integer field that must be in the range 0 to 100. The length of a sequence of values (an array) can also be specified, either as a fixed length or a range of permitted lengths. Constraints can also be specified as logical combinations of sets of basic constraints.

Values used as constraints can either be literals used in the PDU specification, or ASN.1 values specified elsewhere in the schema file. Some ASN.1 tools will make these ASN.1 values available to programmers in the generated source code. Used as constants for the protocol being defined, developers can use these in the protocol&#x27;s logic implementation. Thus all the PDUs and protocol constants can be defined in the schema, and all implementations of the protocol in any supported language draw upon those values. This avoids the need for developers to hand code protocol constants in their implementation&#x27;s source code. This significantly aids protocol development; the protocol&#x27;s constants can be altered in the ASN.1 schema and all implementations are updated simply by recompiling, promoting a rapid and low risk development cycle.

If the ASN.1 tools properly implement constraints checking in the generated source code, this acts to automatically validate protocol data during program operation. Generally ASN.1 tools will include constraints checking into the generated serialization / deserialization routines, raising errors or exceptions if out-of-bounds data is encountered. It is complex to implement all aspects of ASN.1 constraints in an ASN.1 compiler. Not all tools support the full range of possible constraints expressions. XML schema and JSON schema both support similar constraints concepts. Tool support for constraints varies. Microsoft&#x27;s xsd.exe compiler ignores them.

ASN.1 is visually similar to Augmented Backus-Naur form (ABNF), which is used to define many Internet protocols like HTTP and SMTP. However, in practice they are quite different: ASN.1 defines a data structure, which can be encoded in various ways (e.g. JSON, XML, binary). ABNF, on the other hand, defines the encoding (&quot;syntax&quot;) at the same time it defines the data structure (&quot;semantics&quot;). ABNF tends to be used more frequently for defining textual, human-readable protocols, and generally is not used to define type–length–value encodings.

Many programming languages define language-specific serialization formats. For instance, Python&#x27;s &quot;pickle&quot; module and Ruby&#x27;s &quot;Marshal&quot; module. These formats are generally language specific. They also don&#x27;t require a schema, which makes them easier to use in ad hoc storage scenarios, but inappropriate for communications protocols.

JSON and XML similarly do not require a schema, making them easy to use. They are also both cross-platform standards that are broadly popular for communications protocols, particularly when combined with a JSON schema or XML schema.

Some ASN.1 tools are able to translate between ASN.1 and XML schema (XSD). The translation is standardised by the ITU. This makes it possible for a protocol to be defined in ASN.1, and also automatically in XSD. Thus it is possible (though perhaps ill-advised) to have in a project an XSD schema being compiled by ASN.1 tools producing source code that serializes objects to/from JSON wireformat. A more practical use is to permit other sub-projects to consume an XSD schema instead of an ASN.1 schema, perhaps suiting tools availability for the sub-projects language of choice, with XER used as the protocol wireformat.

<text>Joseph Jacques Jean Chrétien (; born January 11, 1934) is a Canadian politician, statesman, and lawyer who served as the 20th prime minister of Canada from 1993 to 2003.

Born and raised in Shawinigan Falls, Quebec, Chrétien is a law graduate from Université Laval. A Liberal, he was first elected to the House of Commons in 1963. He served in various cabinet posts under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, most prominently as minister of Indian affairs and northern development, president of the Treasury Board, minister of finance, and minister of justice. He ran unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1984, losing to John Turner. Chrétien served as deputy prime minister in Turner&#x27;s short-lived government which would be defeated in the 1984 federal election. After Turner led the Liberals to their second defeat at the polls in 1988, Chrétien became leader of the Liberals and leader of the Opposition in 1990, returning to politics after briefly working in the private sector. In the 1993 federal election, Chrétien led the Liberals to a strong majority government before leading the party to two additional majorities in 1997 and 2000.

Chrétien became prime minister at a time when Canada was on the brink of a debt crisis as a result of a ballooning budget deficit. Adhering to a Third Way economic philosophy, his government produced a series of austerity budgets which included major cuts to healthcare funding transfers to the provinces as well as cuts to welfare programs, leading to Canada&#x27;s first budget surplus in nearly 30 years; the latter half of Chrétien&#x27;s tenure saw consecutive budget surpluses which were used to fund tax cuts and pay down government debt. In national unity issues, Chrétien was strongly opposed to the Quebec sovereignty movement. He won a narrow victory as leader of the federalist camp in the 1995 Quebec referendum, and then pioneered the &quot;Clarity Act&quot; to avoid ambiguity in future referendum questions. His government also established the long-gun registry, advanced the &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot;, and laid the groundwork to legalize same-sex marriage. He implemented several major environmental laws, including an updated &quot;Canadian Environmental Protection Act&quot;, the &quot;Pest Control Products Act&quot;, and the &quot;Species At Risk Act&quot;. In foreign policy, Chrétien ordered Canadian military intervention during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the War in Afghanistan but opposed participation in the Iraq War. 

Although his popularity and that of the Liberal Party were seemingly unchallenged for three consecutive federal elections, Chrétien became subject to various political controversies. He was accused of inappropriate behaviour in the Shawinigate and sponsorship scandals, although he has consistently denied any wrongdoing. He also became embroiled in a protracted leadership struggle within the Liberal Party against his finance minister and long-time political rival Paul Martin. In December 2003, as a result of the threat of losing a leadership review and pressure from the pro-Martin faction of the party, Chrétien resigned as prime minister and retired from politics. Chrétien ranks highly in rankings of Canadian prime ministers. At age , Chrétien is the oldest living former Canadian prime minister.

==Early life, family, and education==
Chrétien was born on January 11, 1934, in Shawinigan Falls, Quebec, as the 18th of 19 children (10 of whom did not survive infancy), of Marie (née Boisvert, 1892–1954) and Wellie Chrétien (1887–1980). His younger brother is the neuroendocrinology researcher Michel Chrétien. The working-class Chrétien family was poor, and Chrétien had to wear hand-me-down clothes. Chrétien&#x27;s parents wanted their children to escape a working-class life in Shawinigan by attending a classical college, which was the only way one could attend university in Quebec at the time. Chrétien&#x27;s father made him read the dictionary as a young boy. Chrétien&#x27;s older brother Maurice won a scholarship at the insurance company he was working for, which allowed him to attend medical school, and with the profits from his medical practice, was able to assist his younger siblings to attend the classical colleges. Wellie Chrétien was a staunch Liberal who once got to shake hands as a young man with his hero, Sir Wilfrid Laurier. The local parish priest, Father Auger, a supporter of the Union Nationale who hated all Liberals as &quot;ungodly&quot;, spread malicious rumours about the Liberal Chrétien family, saying he would never let a teenage girl go on a date unchaperoned with any of the Chrétien boys, which caused the young Jean Chrétien to have troubled relations with the Catholic church.

During World War II, the Canadian nationalist Wellie Chrétien had attracted much public disapproval by being a staunch supporter of the war effort, and especially by being one of the few French-Canadians in Shawinigan willing to publicly support sending the conscripts (known as &quot;Zombies&quot;) to fight overseas. Under the 1940 &quot;National Resources Mobilization Act&quot;, the federal government could conscript Canadians only for the defence of Canada, and until late 1944, only volunteers went to fight overseas. In 1940s Quebec, where many French-Canadians were opposed to Canada fighting in the war, and especially to sending the &quot;Zombies&quot; overseas, this made Wellie Chrétien and his family outcasts. Furthermore, during the Grande Noirceur (&quot;Great Darkness&quot;) when Quebec society was dominated by the corrupt Union Nationale patronage machine, the Chrétien family were excluded because of Wellie Chrétien&#x27;s support for the war. The Union Nationale Premier Maurice Duplessis had been an outspoken opponent of Canadian participation in World War II. Until 1964, Quebec had no public schools, and Chrétien was educated in Catholic schools. Chrétien disliked the Catholic priests who educated him and in turn was disliked by them with one of Chrétien&#x27;s former teachers, Father François Lanoue, recalling that Chrétien was the only student he ever grabbed by his ears, as he was too unruly. In an interview, Chrétien called his education &quot;unnatural&quot;, as he recalled an extremely strict regime where the priests beat anyone bloody who dared to question their authority while teaching via rote learning. One of Chrétien&#x27;s classmates recalled &quot;We didn&#x27;t have the right to have feelings or express them&quot;.

Chrétien got his early schooling at a private boys&#x27; school in Joliette. He then attended Séminaire Saint-Joseph de Trois-Rivières. He obtained excellent grades and then studied law at Université Laval, the training ground of the French-Canadian elite. Despite the thuggish image that he cultivated at Séminaire Saint-Joseph, Chrétien&#x27;s grades were high, with an education that focused mostly on Catholic theology, the classics, philosophy, and French. When Chrétien graduated from Séminaire Saint-Joseph, Duplessis came to address the class and upon meeting Chrétien asked him if his grandfather was François Chrétien, who once served as mayor of St-Étiene-des-Grès, and if his father was Wellie Chrétien. Upon receiving affirmative answers to both questions, the premier said with disgust, &quot;Then you&#x27;re a damn &quot;rouge&quot;&quot;.

Later at Laval, Chrétien protested the fact that the law faculty gave the &quot;Revised Statutes of Quebec&quot; free to Union Nationale students while Liberal students had to pay $10 for it, which led him and another student whose family was well connected to meet Duplessis in his office. Duplessis told Chrétien the Union Nationale only rewarded those who had &quot;faith&quot;, and if he wanted the book for free, then he should have had &quot;faith&quot;, noting that there were no &quot;rights&quot; in Quebec as he was &quot;Le Chef&quot; (&quot;the boss&quot;). At Laval, Chrétien became active in the Young Liberals, becoming president as no one else wanted the job as most students were too frightened to antagonize the Union Nationale. In 1958 he attended the Liberal convention in Ottawa that chose Lester Pearson as the party&#x27;s leader, and where Chrétien supported Paul Martin Sr.

Chrétien later drew attention to his humble origins, calling himself &quot;le petit gars de Shawinigan&quot;, or the &quot;little guy from Shawinigan&quot;. In his youth he suffered from an attack of Bell&#x27;s palsy, permanently leaving one side of his face partially paralyzed. Chrétien used this in his first Liberal leadership campaign, saying that he was &quot;One politician who didn&#x27;t talk out of both sides of his mouth.&quot; He is also deaf in one ear.

On September 10, 1957, he married Aline Chaîné, whom he had met when he was 18 and she was 16. They had three children: France (b. 1958), Hubert (b. 1965) and Michel (b. 1968), who was adopted in 1970. France Chrétien Desmarais, who is a lawyer, is married to André Desmarais, the son of Paul Desmarais, Sr., and the president and co-chief executive officer of his father&#x27;s company, Power Corporation, based in Montreal, Canada. Reflecting Chrétien&#x27;s poor relations with the Catholic church, the local priest in Shawinigan, Father Auger, refused to marry Chrétien in his church, saying only &quot;bleus&quot; (blues, i.e. Union Nationale supporters) were welcome in his church and &quot;rouges&quot; (reds, i.e. Liberals) were not.

==Early political career==
Chrétien practised law at the Shawinigan firm of Alexandre Gélinas and Joe Lafond until he was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal from the riding of Saint-Maurice–Laflèche in the 1963 election. He represented this Shawinigan-based constituency, renamed Saint-Maurice in 1968, for all but eight of the next 41 years. The Social Credit Party had won the district in the 1962 election, and Chrétien won the Liberal nomination for the 1963 election as the previous Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) decided to retire. Chrétien won the election by portraying the incumbent Social Credit MP, Gérard Lamy, as a &quot;buffoon&quot; who made French-Canadians look stupid. Early in Chrétien&#x27;s career, Dalton Camp described him as looking like &quot;the driver of the getaway car&quot;, a condescending assessment which stuck with him, and which journalists and others often cited throughout his career, usually considering his eventual success. The only committee assignment he requested, and obtained, during his first term was to the Finance Committee.

Shortly before the 1965 election, Chrétien very briefly served as parliamentary secretary to Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. When Pearson recruited his &quot;Three Wise Men&quot; (Jean Marchand, Gérard Pelletier, and Pierre Trudeau) into the cabinet, Chrétien was disappointed at being bypassed, telling Pearson he deserved to be promoted to the cabinet. Starting in 1966, he served for a more substantial period of time as parliamentary secretary to Minister of Finance Mitchell Sharp. Sharp was to serve as Chrétien&#x27;s mentor and patron, helping him rise through the ranks.

In 1967, Chrétien visited western Canada for the first time, which he was curious to see. In Vancouver, he declared in a speech about the demands for more powers for Quebec being made by Union Nationale Premier Daniel Johnson that &quot;those who are in favour of a special status [for Quebec] are often separatists who don&#x27;t want to admit they are separatists&quot;, which caused an uproar in Quebec, with Johnson saying he just wanted more powers for Quebec, not independence. When, in a speech during a visit to Montreal for Expo 67, French President Charles de Gaulle said &quot;Vive le Québec libre!&quot; (&quot;Long Live A Free Quebec!&quot;) and compared the Quiet Revolution to the liberation of France from the Nazis, Chrétien demanded during a cabinet meeting that the government order de Gaulle to leave Canada.

===Joins cabinet===
Chrétien was appointed minister without portfolio in April 1967 and then minister of national revenue in January 1968, making him a junior minister in the cabinet. During the 1968 Liberal leadership race, Chrétien fought hard on behalf of his mentor Sharp, who aspired to lead the Liberal Party. When Sharp withdrew from the race, Chrétien followed Sharp in swinging his support behind the man who eventually won the race, Pierre Trudeau.

 After the June 1968 election that gave the Liberals a majority government, Trudeau appointed Chrétien minister of Indian affairs and northern development. Trudeau and Chrétien were never close, as the gulf between the intellectual Trudeau and the decidedly non-intellectual Chrétien was too wide, but Trudeau did value Chrétien as an extremely loyal and competent minister, and as a &quot;tough guy&quot; trouble-shooter who could handle difficult assignments. Trudeau and his intellectual advisors in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO) held Chrétien in contempt as someone who spoke French with a working-class accent and whose manners were unpolished, but they appreciated his toughness and ability to get things done.

While at Indian Affairs, Chrétien introduced the 1969 White Paper, a proposal to abolish treaties between Canada and First Nations and related legislation including the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. Critics charged that the goal was to assimilate First Nations people into the general Canadian population. First Nations groups widely opposed the White Paper, and it was later abandoned. It was the 1969 White Paper that first brought Chrétien to widespread public attention in English Canada. At a press conference announcing the White Paper, Chrétien openly clashed with Indian activists with one First Nations woman asking Chrétien, &quot;When did we lose our identity?&quot;, to which he replied: &quot;When you signed the treaties&quot;, which prompted boos and jeers. Another woman from the Iroquois reserve at Brantford asked Chrétien, &quot;How can you come here and ask us to become citizens, when we were here long before you?&quot;, noting the Crown had granted the Grand River valley to Joseph Brant in 1784, to which Chrétien had no reply. Cree activist Harold Cardinal attacked Chrétien and Trudeau for the White Paper in his bestselling 1969 book &quot;The Unjust Society&quot;, accusing them of &quot;cultural genocide&quot; against the First Nations. To counteract such criticism, Chrétien adopted an Inuk boy from a local orphanage during a 1970 visit to the Northwest Territories. As Indian Affairs minister, Chrétien fell in love with the far north of Canada, whose beauty moved him, and he vacationed in the north every summer during his time while holding the Indian Affairs portfolio.

During the October Crisis of 1970, Chrétien told Trudeau to &quot;act now, explain later&quot; when Trudeau was hesitant to invoke the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;. Eighty-five percent of Canadians agreed with the move. In the 1972 election, Chrétien, who was frightened by a near-defeat in 1968, had a friend. Antonio Genest, win the Progressive Conservative (PC) nomination and then run a deliberately inept campaign in order to ensure his re-election. Robert Bourassa, the Liberal premier of Quebec, was a nationalist who frequently pressed for more devolution of federal powers to his province, making him Trudeau&#x27;s &quot;bête noire&quot;, with the two men openly feuding. In 1971, when the Bourassa government began the James Bay Project to develop hydroelectric dams on rivers flowing into James Bay, which was opposed by the local Cree bands who claimed the land slated for development, Chrétien intervened on the side of the Cree. In a speech Chrétien said Bourassa &quot;could go to hell&quot;, stated he did not have the right to build on or flood the land claimed by the Cree, and hired lawyers to argue for the Cree in the courts. In November 1973, a judge ruled for the Cree, but a few days later the appeals court ruled for Quebec.

In 1974, Chrétien was appointed President of the Treasury Board, and beginning in 1976, he served as Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. At the Treasury Board, Chrétien become known as &quot;Doctor No&quot;, as he refused in a brusque manner requests from other ministers for more money for their departments. The 1970s were a time of rapid inflation, and Chrétien often clashed with public sector unions who demanded wage increases. At a time when deficits were rising and the Trudeau government was widely seen as drifting, Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;tough guy&quot; image won him widespread attention, with many in the media portraying him as one of the few people in the Trudeau cabinet willing to make tough decisions. As industry minister, Chrétien was in charge of the Trudeau government&#x27;s efforts to &quot;diversify&quot; the economy by trading more with Asia and Europe and less with the United States. Chrétien often complained the high Canadian dollar hindered his efforts to &quot;diversify&quot; trade, and he became known for his belief in the value of a low dollar. As industry minister, Chrétien moved to the left, being known for his populist policies, imposing tariffs on clothing made abroad to encourage more production in Canada, and having the government fund the development of the Challenger aircraft.

===Minister of finance===
In 1977, following the resignation of Finance Minister Donald MacDonald, Chrétien succeeded him. He was the first francophone minister of finance, and remains one of only three francophones to have held that post. Chrétien&#x27;s time at Finance highlighted his &quot;enforcer&quot; status, namely as someone who often helped to execute Trudeau&#x27;s policies, but who rarely helped Trudeau to make policy. During his time at Finance, Trudeau completely excluded Chrétien from any role in making financial policy, instead expecting Chrétien to simply carry out the policies that he and his advisors at the PMO had decided beforehand without consulting Chrétien at all. 

Trudeau was extremely close to the West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, and during the 1978 G7 summit in Bonn, Trudeau had extensive discussions with his friend Schmidt about how best to win re-election in 1979. Schmidt suggested to Trudeau that he respond to criticism of the deficits he had been running by bringing in some big cuts to spending, an idea that Trudeau took up. In 1978 Trudeau announced in a press statement $2 billion in cuts without bothering to inform Chrétien beforehand about what he had decided to do, leaving his finance minister looking clueless in the resulting press interview. Chrétien found this experience so humiliating that he seriously considering resigning in protest. Chrétien was especially humiliated by the fact that Chancellor Schmidt was better informed of about what was going to happen than he was, which underlined that he was not a member of Trudeau&#x27;s inner circle. 

Chrétien presented the two federal budgets to the House floor in 1978, one in April and the other in November.
===Major role in referendum campaign===
The Liberals lost the federal election of May 1979 to a minority Progressive Conservative government led by Joe Clark. However, the PC government fell when the House of Commons failed to approve its budget in December, triggering the 1980 Canadian federal election in February. Trudeau had originally resigned the Liberal leadership after his 1979 election loss, but no leadership election had taken place to choose his successor before the fall of the Clark government; this allowed him to rescind his resignation and lead the Liberals to victory with a majority government.

Trudeau appointed Chrétien as Minister of Justice and Attorney General. In this role, Chrétien was a major force in the 1980 Quebec referendum, being one of the main federal representatives &quot;on the ground&quot; during the campaign. His fiery and emotional speeches would enthrall federalist crowds with his blunt warnings of the consequences of separation. During the referendum, Chrétien fiercely fought behind the scenes with the leader of the Quebec Liberals, Claude Ryan, who served as the chairman of the &quot;non&quot; committee, about the best course to follow, with Ryan favouring a more Quebec nationalist message as opposed to Chrétien&#x27;s unabashed Canadian nationalist message. Chrétien delivered an average of six or seven speeches a day during the 1980 referendum all across Quebec and always managed to work in a local reference in every speech.

===Patriation of the Constitution===
Chrétien also served as minister of state for social development and minister responsible for constitutional negotiations, playing a significant role in the debates leading to the patriation of the Constitution of Canada in 1982. On September 28, 1981, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could patriate the British North America Acts without the consent of the provinces, but also ruled this would be &quot;odious&quot;. Chrétien informed the premiers opposing patriation that Ottawa would unilaterally patriate the Constitution, but was willing to talk at a final conference. During the resulting First Ministers conference in November 1981, two of the premiers, Allan Blakeney of Saskatchewan and Sterling Lyon of Manitoba, made it clear that their principal objection to the proposed Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was that it undermined the ancient British tradition of parliamentary supremacy. Ever since the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the principle had always been that Parliament was the supreme lawmaking body in the land, and both Blakeney and Lyon were concerned that the Charter would give too much power to the courts.

Chrétien was the chief negotiator of what would be called the &quot;Kitchen Accord&quot;, an agreement which led to the agreement of nine provinces to patriation. In the Kitchen Accord, Chrétien, along with Attorneys-General Roy McMurtry of Ontario and Roy Romanow of Saskatchewan, devised the compromise of Section 33, the so-called &quot;notwithstanding clause&quot;, allowing Parliament and provincial legislatures to overrule the courts in Charter cases. Chrétien remembered that Trudeau &quot;hated&quot; the idea of Section 33 and that he had to tell him: &quot;Pierre, if you don&#x27;t take the notwithstanding clause, you don&#x27;t have the Charter.&quot; Trudeau only accepted Section 33 when Ontario Premier Bill Davis, one of only two premiers supporting the federal government (Richard Hatfield of New Brunswick being the other), phoned him to say he would not support Trudeau in London if Trudeau did not accept Section 33, which Chrétien remembered changed Trudeau&#x27;s attitude completely. In a 2012 interview, Chrétien defended the controversial Section 33, saying: &quot;Because some would argue that in a society the elected people have to be supreme — not judges — and I subscribe to that. Look at what happened in the United States where the judges reign according to their so-called philosophy. That is not the tradition here.&quot; All of the English-speaking premiers accepted the compromise of Section 33, but Quebec Premier René Lévesque did not. Chrétien&#x27;s role in the dealings would not be forgotten in his native province of Quebec (although the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Quebec was bound by it). One of Trudeau&#x27;s aides, Barry Strayer, later said about Chrétien&#x27;s role in the constitutional battle: &quot;He was able to contemplate compromises that Trudeau would not have been able to. Everybody saw him as a honest broker. Without him you could argue it would not have happened.&quot;

===Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources===
In 1982, Chrétien was appointed Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, putting him in charge of enforcing the National Energy Program (NEP), which helped to make him a hated figure in Alberta. Chrétien himself was doubtful about the value of the NEP, saying at the time of his appointment as Energy Minister that, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to back off on the NEP without destroying our credibility,&quot; but upon learning that Trudeau and his right-hand man, Finance Minister Marc Lalonde, were in favour of continuing the NEP, Chrétien decided to fall in line rather than risk his chances of one day winning the Liberal leadership. Chrétien&#x27;s battles with Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed over the NEP helped to confirm his disdain for provincial politicians, whom he saw as petty people only interested in their own provinces at the expense of the nation.

=== 1984: First leadership bid and relationship with Turner ===

After Trudeau announced his retirement as Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader in early 1984, Chrétien was one of the candidates seeking to replace him as leader. The experience was a hard one for Chrétien, as many of his longtime Cabinet allies supported the bid of John Turner, who was viewed as more electable, much to Chrétien&#x27;s intense disappointment. During the leadership race in the spring of 1984, Chrétien ran as the defender of the Trudeau era and promised to continue all of Trudeau&#x27;s policies, unlike Turner, who promised a break with Trudeau. During the leadership race, Chrétien presented himself as a folksy leftish populist and mocked Turner as a right-wing Bay Street snob who was out of touch with ordinary people. Chrétien opposed Turner&#x27;s claim that the national deficit was not a problem, arguing in a speech, &quot;We have to use the deficit to keep the dignity of our people.&quot; Chrétien attracted larger and more enthusiastic crowds than anything that Turner ever managed, but most of the Liberal Party establishment had rallied to Turner when he announced his candidacy in March 1984, which proved to be an insurmountable handicap for Chrétien. Chrétien was thought to be a dark horse until the end but lost on the second ballot to Turner at the leadership convention that June. Liberal Party president Iona Campagnolo introduced Chrétien as &quot;Second on the ballot, but first in our hearts.&quot; Turner appointed Chrétien Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for External Affairs.

After winning the leadership race, Turner wanted to reconcile with Chrétien and lead a united party into the coming general election, and so asked Chrétien what terms he would accept. Chrétien, angry about losing the leadership race, asked for terms he knew Turner could never give him, demanding to be appointed Quebec lieutenant, with control of patronage and organization in Quebec. However, Turner had already promised the position to André Ouellet in exchange for support in the leadership race. As a result, Turner compromised by creating a troika of Chrétien, Ouellet, and Lalonde to run Liberal operations in Quebec. The troika was a sham, and during the 1984 election, its three members spent more time feuding with one another than in combating the Progressive Conservatives.

Chrétien&#x27;s demand for the Quebec lieutenancy was not his only issue with Turner, as he almost immediately clashed with the Prime Minister over the calling of an early election. As the last general election had been held in February 1980, the next general election could be held no later than February 1985. Chrétien advised Turner not to ask the Governor General to dissolve Parliament, but to instead keep it in session during the fall of 1984 to give the government a record to run on in a winter election in early 1985. Turner disregarded Chrétien&#x27;s advice, believing that a boost in the polls after he assumed the premiership in late June 1984 justified asking for Parliament to be dissolved, and for an election to be held in September 1984.

==1984–1993: In opposition==

Relations between Chrétien and Turner were strained, especially after the Liberals&#x27; severe defeat in the 1984 election by the Progressive Conservatives, now led by Brian Mulroney. Chrétien was one of only 17 Liberal MPs elected from Quebec (the party had won 74 out of 75 seats there in 1980), and one of only four elected from a riding outside Montreal.

Chrétien was a major focal point of dissatisfaction with Turner, with many polls showing his popularity. His 1985 book, &quot;Straight from the Heart&quot;, was an instant bestseller that recounted his early life in Shawinigan, his years spent in the House of Commons of Canada as both a member of Parliament and Cabinet minister, and his failed 1984 leadership bid.

===1986: Temporarily leaves politics===

Chrétien, whose relations with Turner were very poor, resigned his seat and left public life for a time. On February 27, 1986, Chrétien, accompanied by his special executive assistant Jean Carle, went to Turner&#x27;s office to hand in his resignation. Turner forced Chrétien to wait a considerable period of time during which Carle broke down in tears, and Chrétien was visibly angry when Turner finally received them, making for a tense and barely civil meeting. Chrétien&#x27;s resignation was largely motivated by his desire to better organize against Turner in the leadership review, which was due in the fall of 1986. Now working in the private sector again, Chrétien sat on the boards of several corporations, including the Power Corporation of Canada subsidiary Consolidated Bathurst, the Toronto-Dominion Bank, and the Brick Warehouse Corporation. Chrétien professed to be retired from politics, but he told reporters within days of his retirement, &quot;I will always be a politician. I love politics.&quot; Crucially, Chrétien did not disband the campaign organization that he founded in 1984, suggesting that his retirement had always been intended to be temporary.

In November 1986, when the Liberals held their leadership review, Chrétien attempted to organize against Turner, which led to a bruising battle between factions loyal to the two men. Chrétien used Turner&#x27;s penchant for heavy drinking to spread rumors that Turner was an alcoholic who was simply too drunk most of the time to lead the Liberals to power effectively. He formally claimed to be neutral on the question of Turner&#x27;s management of the Liberal Party, but lobbied as many Liberal MPs and senators as possible behind the scenes for their support in bringing down Turner. The intense emotions stirred up by the leadership review boiled over when Chrétien arrived to vote in the review, leading to a chaotic scene on the convention floor where police had to be called to quell physical fighting between Chrétien partisans and Turner partisans. Turner won the leadership review, earning about 75% of the delegate vote.

In the 1988 election, the Liberals only experienced a moderate recovery, doubling the number of seats they won in 1984. However, Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives won a second consecutive majority government, campaigning in favour of a free trade agreement with the United States. Having lost a second straight general election, Turner announced his resignation as Liberal leader in 1989, triggering the June 1990 Liberal leadership election in Calgary.

===1990: Returns to politics and wins Liberal leadership===

At a press conference in Ottawa on January 23, 1990, Chrétien declared that he would run for the Liberal Party leadership and proudly stated that the day would be remembered as the beginning of the &quot;Chrétien era&quot; in Canada. Chrétien&#x27;s principal opponent in the contest, Paul Martin, was generally seen as the ideological heir to Turner, while Chrétien was seen to be the ideological heir to Trudeau. The fact that most of the Liberals who had supported Turner in the 1980s supported Martin in 1990 confirmed Chrétien&#x27;s disdain for Martin, whom he saw as a Bay Street &quot;big shot&quot; like Turner.

The most controversial issue facing Canada during the first half of 1990 was the Meech Lake Accord, a set of proposed constitutional amendments that would have seen a significant devolution of federal powers to the provinces and included a clause that would have recognized Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada. Chrétien had announced in a January 1990 speech that he was an opponent of Meech Lake but stated that he would support the accord with amendments, such as scrapping the controversial &quot;distinct society&quot; clause as written; having the preamble to the constitution instead declare that Quebec was a &quot;distinct society&quot;; and adding a new clause saying if any conflict arose between the constitutional recognition of Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot; and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the latter would always prevail. The &quot;distinct society&quot; clause theoretically could have been the basis of a wide-ranging devolution of federal power, since the clause might have empowered the Quebec government to pass any law short of secession to protect the &quot;distinct society&quot;. This made the clause very popular in Quebec, but aroused passionate opposition in English Canada. In a much-discussed essay, Trudeau had warned that giving Quebec the constitutional right to be a &quot;distinct society&quot; would mean that Quebec could quite legally start to expel its anglophone minority. Chrétien&#x27;s proposed amendments would have meant that the constitution would have recognized Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot; but effectively gutted any attempt to use that to grant any special powers to Quebec. In private, Chrétien opposed Meech Lake, but as the accord was extremely popular in Quebec, running as an out-and-out opponent of Meech Lake was judged to be too risky politically, causing him to conditionally oppose the accord in public. Meech Lake placed Chrétien in a difficult position, as it was very popular in Quebec and loathed by the Trudeau wing of the Liberals; Chrétien needed the support of both entities in the leadership race. He tried to avoid talking about Meech Lake as much as possible, which was a minefield issue for him; he instead stuck to generalities about national unity. Martin, by contrast, had declared himself an unconditional supporter of Meech Lake as it was; he was also quite willing to talk about his support.

Chrétien&#x27;s key campaign man was Jim Karygiannis, who specialized in signing up immigrants to serve as Chrétien delegates. He signed 9,500 immigrants as Chrétien delegates between January and June 1990. In large part because of Karygiannis and his team, Chrétien had by late April 1990 signed up 1,500 delegates, which made him the clear front-runner compared to Martin&#x27;s 500 delegates.

A key moment in the leadership contest took place at an all-candidates debate in Montreal on June 2, 1990. The discussion quickly turned to the Meech Lake Accord, which had emerged as the major policy issue dividing Chrétien and Martin. Martin attempted to force Chrétien to abandon his nuanced position on Meech Lake and speak out either for or against it, saying that Chrétien&#x27;s position of opposing Meech Lake as it was, but being willing to support it with amendments, was trying to have it both ways. When Chrétien refused to endorse Meech Lake as it was, young Liberal delegates crowding the hall began to chant &quot;vendu&quot; (&quot;sellout&quot; in French), &quot;you&#x27;re selling out to the Anglos,&quot; and &quot;Judas&quot; at Chrétien. One of Chrétien&#x27;s aides frantically asked that Martin &quot;get the fuck out there and do something,&quot; as the Young Liberals continued shouting abuse at Chrétien to his clear discomfort, only to be told that the Quebec youth were &quot;hotheads&quot; whom nobody could control. Privately, Chrétien was deeply enraged by the incident, claimed that the delegates shouting &quot;vendu&quot; at him were actually Martin supporters from Toronto, and charged that their poor French had betrayed that they had not been from Quebec. Martin denied involvement in &quot;coordinating&quot; any response from the floor or a similar outburst by his supporters at the convention. Ultimately, Chrétien defeated Martin for the leadership on the first and only ballot, but his position on Meech Lake had irreversibly damaged his reputation in his home province.

===Leader of the Official Opposition===

As Chrétien&#x27;s leadership victory occurred on June 23, 1990 – the same day that the Meech Lake Accord failed to gain ratification – he was heavily criticized in the Quebec media for his opposition to the accord. Photographs of Chrétien embracing Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells, a prominent opponent of Meech Lake, at the convention attracted much negative comment in Quebec. His leadership was also shaken by the defection of francophone MPs (and Martin loyalists) Jean Lapierre and Gilles Rocheleau from the caucus to the new Bloc Québécois (BQ); Lapierre and Rocheleau contended that they could not serve under the anti-Meech Lake Chrétien. In a by-election for Laurier—Sainte-Marie on August 13, 1990, the Bloc&#x27;s Gilles Duceppe badly defeated Chrétien&#x27;s hand-picked candidate Denis Coderre, costing the Liberals a constituency they had held since 1917; many attributed this to Chrétien&#x27;s opposition to the Meech Lake Accord. Upon becoming Liberal leader, Chrétien appointed his friend Eddie Goldenberg as his chief of staff, and formed a leadership team comprising John Rae and David Zussman as his policy advisors, his &quot;surrogate son&quot; Jean Carle as his special executive assistant, Warren Kinsella as his media adviser, and George Radwanski as his speech-writer. All members of this leadership team were later to play prominent roles in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office during Chrétien&#x27;s time as Prime Minister.

In September 1990, Chrétien, seeing a chance to make a strong impression on public opinion after a shaky start as leader, reaped a major windfall after Mulroney introduced an unpopular Goods and Services Tax (GST), which Chrétien decided to vigorously oppose. Traditionally in Canada, the government had levied a 13.5% Manufacturer&#x27;s Sales Tax (MST) paid by manufacturers, who passed on the cost of the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since foreign manufacturers did not pay the MST, however, this placed Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage in their home market. To compensate, the government had levied tariffs on manufactured imports to maintain a level playing field. When the free trade agreement with the United States came into effect in 1989, the government could no longer levy tariffs on American imports, leading to furious complaints from Canadian industry about having to compete with American companies who did not pay the MST. To save Canadian industry and the jobs of those Canadians employed in manufacturing from being destroyed by American competition, the Mulroney government decided in late 1989 to abolish the MST and replace it with the GST, whose 7% costs would be borne by consumers. On the proposed GST, Chrétien was torn between his belief that the tax was economically necessary and his desire to score political points by opposing a proposed tax that most Canadians hated; consequently, he was initially vague about where he stood on the GST. Only in September 1990, after months of vacillation, did Chrétien finally make up his mind to oppose the GST.

Chrétien&#x27;s decision to oppose the GST in 1990 was taken for reasons of political expediency rather than principle, namely that he needed an issue to oppose the government on that would allow him to connect with the public; sources close to Chrétien were later to claim that he had wanted to support the GST bill, but his caucus had forced him to oppose it against his will. At a Liberal event in the fall of 1990, Chrétien stated that if he became Prime Minister, &quot;the Mulroney GST will disappear&quot;, going on to say: &quot;I am opposed to the GST. I have always been opposed to it. And I will be opposed to it, always&quot;. To capitalize on widespread public dislike on the proposed GST, Chrétien ordered the Liberal-dominated Senate to defeat the GST bill in late September 1990, leading Mulroney on September 27, 1990, to appoint eight PC senators to give the Tories a majority using a never-before-used section of the &quot;Constitution Act&quot;, the so-called &quot;Deadlock Clause&quot;. At that point, Chrétien ordered the Liberal senators to filibuster the GST bill, reducing the Senate to scenes of chaos for the entire fall of 1990. On October 24, 1990, a poll revealed that the Liberals had fallen behind the New Democrats, which Chrétien admitted in an interview might have something to do with the scenes of obstructionist, often childish behavior by the Liberal senators.

In December 1990, Chrétien returned to the House of Commons after winning a by-election in the safe Liberal riding of Beauséjour in New Brunswick. The incumbent, Fernand Robichaud, stood down in Chrétien&#x27;s favour, which is traditional practice when a newly elected party leader does not have a seat in the Commons. Initially, Chrétien had planned to wait until the next general election before running, but was advised by Herb Gray that: &quot;To have credibility, you&#x27;re got to be in the House. You can&#x27;t afford to wait two more years until a general election.&quot; Gray&#x27;s appeal changed Chrétien&#x27;s mind about when to seek a seat in the House of Commons. For much of 1991–92, Chrétien found himself emotionally exhausted after his adopted son Michel was charged with kidnapping, rape, and sodomy against a Montreal woman and was convicted. Michel Chrétien suffered from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and had a long history of legal trouble.

In October 1991, Chrétien first expressed his views about how best to end the recession which had begun in 1990, arguing that the answer was a policy of slow devaluation in which the dollar would be allowed to decline against other major world currencies; this would have the effect of both pricing out foreign imports and, by giving Canadian firms a competitive advantage in world markets, boosting exports. However, Chrétien concluded that his planned export offensive powered by a low dollar would come to nothing if other nations maintained tariffs to keep Canadian goods out of their markets. In order to make his plans to export Canada back into prosperity work, Chrétien decided that the solution was globalization. Besides for globalization, Chrétien also argued to combat the recession, the federal government needed to make the system of unemployment insurance less generous, and to end the policy of high interest rates maintained by Bank of Canada Governor John Crow to achieve his target of zero percent inflation, which Chrétien argued was needlessly crippling the economy.

In November 1991, Chrétien organized a party conference in Aylmer, Quebec, where the Liberals formally disavowed most of the economic nationalism and protectionism of the Pearson-Trudeau years and instead embraced globalization as the cure for the ongoing recession. Reflecting this changed emphasis, the Liberals declared their support for the free trade agreement with the United States, which the party had famously promised to tear up if they won the 1988 election; instead, Mulroney was now denounced for not going far enough in opening up the economy by signing more free trade agreements with other nations.

Chrétien revealed himself to be a staunch &quot;hard federalist&quot; favouring a strong federal government at the expense of the provinces, much along the same lines as his predecessor Trudeau. However, unlike Trudeau, Chrétien supported the Charlottetown Accord of August 1992, another package of constitutional amendments which proposed devolving federal powers to the provinces and once again recognized Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot;. Chrétien endorsed the Charlottetown Accord on the rather negative grounds that the constitutional debates of the late 1980s and early 1990s were destroying Canada, saying it &quot;was bleeding the nation to death&quot; and that Charlottetown was the best way of ending that debate in order to move the focus back to the economic recession. At a Liberal caucus meeting on September 8, 1992, Chrétien declared that &quot;if we had been the government we would not have made this deal&quot;, and that only reason to support Charlottetown was that rejecting it would increase support for Quebec separatism.

When Mulroney began to lose ground in the polls, Chrétien was the major beneficiary. In preparation for the 1993 election, Chrétien won the right to have final approval over riding nominations and to veto any candidate that displeased him. Chrétien&#x27;s use of this power caused some protests within the party, with John Nunziata publicly complaining that, &quot;The backroom guys have taken control of the party. I guess they think they can muzzle us all&quot;. Chrétien was so confident that he was going to win the 1993 election that he formed his transition team in October 1992 to prepare for the hand-over of power 13 months before it actually happened.

====The 1993 election====
Mulroney announced his retirement in February, and was succeeded by Minister of National Defence Kim Campbell in June. Campbell pulled the PCs to within a few percentage points of the Liberals by the time the writs were dropped in September.

On September 19, Chrétien released the Liberal platform. The 112-page document, &quot;Creating Opportunity&quot;, quickly became known as the Red Book because of its bright red cover. Chrétien&#x27;s rival Paul Martin, who led the team that produced the Red Book, was less complimentary about it in private; he was often reported to have said: &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me about the Red Book, I wrote the damn thing, and I know that it is a lot of crap!&quot; 

The Liberals promised to remove the GST, which had previously been imposed by the Tories; Sheila Copps famously promised to resign within a year of taking office if the GST was not repealed. Chrétien also promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and reform the unemployment insurance system. The Liberals were in favour of a free trade agreement for North America in principle, but accused Mulroney of having given away too much to the Americans and Mexicans when he signed NAFTA in 1992, and stated that the Liberal government would renegotiate NAFTA on more favourable terms to Canada within six months of taking office. Failing that, Chrétien promised that Canada would renounce NAFTA. The main emphasis was on a promise to spend $6 billion on improving infrastructure in a Keynesian move to fight the recession of the early 1990s. As regarding the debt situation, Chrétien promised to reduce Canada&#x27;s deficit to 3 per cent of GDP (the same deficit to GDP ratio required to enter the European Union) within three years of taking office. Chrétien made it clear that the 3 percent deficit to GDP ratio would apply only to the federal government, whereas the Maastricht Treaty of 1991 which set out the 3 percent deficit to GDP ratio in order to enter the European Union stated that this applied to all levels of government. The Liberal government promised to achieve its goal of reducing the deficit to three percent of the GDP by cancelling the contract to replace the Sea King helicopters, privatizing Toronto Pearson Airport, and by eliminating unspecified &quot;waste&quot; in the government. After the 3 percent target had been achieved within the first three years of taking office, Chrétien promised the deficit would be eliminated at some unspecified time in the future. Martin wanted to promise to eliminate the deficit altogether, but had been overruled by Chrétien, who had wanted to present the Liberals as the &quot;caring&quot; party that would defend social programs, unlike the &quot;heartless&quot; Conservatives and the Reform Party who Chrétien claimed wanted to eliminate the deficit within two or three years by gutting social programs with no thought for any suffering that this might cause. Chrétien claimed in his campaign speeches that Reform&#x27;s plans for eliminating the deficit within two or three years of taking office would cause at least a 25 percent unemployment rate, if not higher, which Chrétien claimed starkly in a series of speeches would cause a bloody &quot;revolution&quot;. Chrétien had personally chosen the target of reducing the deficit to 3 percent of GDP as it made the Liberals seemed fiscally responsible while at the same time promised that the Liberals would not inflict too much economic pain to achieve that fiscal responsibility. One Liberal candidate Herb Dhaliwal recalled that for Chrétien at time of the 1993 election that the national deficit was not a major issue and that: &quot;His attitude was that the deficit is ok as long as you can manage it&quot;.

By late September 1993, the Liberals had a double-digit lead in most opinion polls, and by October they were favourites to win at least a minority government. Even at this stage, however, Chrétien&#x27;s personal approval ratings were far behind those of Campbell. Realizing this, the PC campaign team released a series of ads attacking Chrétien. The ads were viewed as a last-ditch effort to keep the Liberals from winning a majority. The second ad, released on October 14, appeared to mock Chrétien&#x27;s facial paralysis and generated a severe backlash from all sides. Even some Tory candidates called for the ad to be removed. Campbell was not directly responsible for the ad, and ordered it off the air over her staff&#x27;s objections.

On October 25, the Liberals were elected to a majority government, winning 177 seatsthe third-best performance in the Liberals&#x27; history, and their most impressive win since their record of 190 seats in 1949. The PCs were nearly wiped out, winning only two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered by a governing party at the federal level. Chrétien himself yielded Beauséjour back to Robichaud in order to run in his old riding, Saint-Maurice. However, he was unable to lead the Liberals back to their traditional dominance in Quebec, being one of only four Liberal MPs elected from that province outside the Montreal area. With few exceptions, most of the support that had switched from the Liberals to the PCs nine years earlier switched to the Bloc Québécois, which became the Official Opposition.

==Prime Minister (1993–2003)==

On November 4, 1993, Chrétien became prime minister. While Trudeau, Joe Clark, and Mulroney had been relative political outsiders prior to becoming prime minister, Chrétien had served in every Liberal cabinet since 1965. This experience gave him knowledge of the Canadian parliamentary system, and allowed Chrétien to establish a very centralized government that, although highly efficient, was also lambasted by critics such as Jeffrey Simpson and the media as being a &quot;friendly dictatorship&quot; and intolerant of internal dissent. Chrétien liked to present himself as the heir to Trudeau, but his governing style had little in common with the intense bouts of governmental activism that had characterised the Trudeau era. The Chrétien government had a cautious, managerial approach to governing, reacting to issues as they arose, and was otherwise inclined to inactivity.

=== Quebec ===

==== 1995 Quebec referendum ====

One of Chrétien&#x27;s main concerns in office was separation of the province of Quebec, which was governed by the sovereigntist Parti Québécois for nearly the entirety of his term. When the 1995 Quebec independence referendum began in September, Chrétien was relaxed and confident of victory as polls showed federalist forces were leading by a wide margin. On October 8, 1995, Lucien Bouchard replaced the separatist premier of Quebec, Jacques Parizeau, as the &quot;de facto&quot; chair of the &quot;oui&quot; committee and, at that point, the support for the side started to dramatically increase, aided by the committee&#x27;s complacency. In the weeks leading to the referendum on October 30, 1995, the federal government was seized with fear and panic as polls showing that, under the leadership of Bouchard, the &quot;oui&quot; side was going to win. On October 30, 1995, the federalist &quot;non&quot; side won by the narrowest of margins, with 50.58%.

==== Aftermath of referendum ====

On November 5, 1995, six days after the referendum, Chrétien and his wife escaped injury when André Dallaire, armed with a knife, broke in the prime minister&#x27;s official residence at 24 Sussex Drive. Aline Chrétien shut and locked the bedroom door until security came, while Chrétien held a stone Inuit carving in readiness. Dallaire was 
a separatist who was angered by the result of the referendum.

In the aftermath of the narrow victory in the referendum, Chrétien started in late 1995 a new policy of &quot;tough love&quot;, also known as &quot;Plan B&quot;, where the federal government sought to discredit Quebec separatism by making it clear to the people of Quebec how difficult it would be to leave Canada. Though Chrétien had promised to enshrine recognition of Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot; in the constitution in order to win the referendum, this promise was quickly forgotten in the aftermath of victory with Chrétien arguing that the very vocal opposition of Ontario Premier Mike Harris to amending the constitution to recognize Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot; made that impossible. Instead, Chrétien had Parliament pass a resolution recognizing Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot;, which had no constitutional force and was only a symbolic step. Though Harris&#x27;s promise to veto any sort of &quot;distinct society&quot; clause in the constitution made fulfilling Chrétien&#x27;s commitment to put such a clause into the constitution impossible, Chrétien did not seem to champion the idea of a &quot;distinct society&quot; clause with any great conviction.

In early 1996, the federal government launched an advertising program to increase the presence of Canada in Quebec, a policy that Chrétien believed would avoid a repeat of the near-defeat of 1995, and was to lead eventually to the Sponsorship scandal. As part of his &quot;Plan B&quot; for combatting Quebec separatism, in a speech in January 1996, Chrétien endorsed the idea of partitioning Quebec in the event of a &quot;oui&quot; vote in another referendum, stating all of the regions of Quebec that voted &quot;non&quot; would remain part of Canada, regardless of what the Quebec separatists thought. On February 15, 1996, Chrétien was confronted by a protester, Bill Clennett, during a walkabout in Hull, Quebec. Chrétien responded with a choke-hold. The press referred to it as the &quot;Shawinigan handshake&quot; (from the name of his home town).

==== &quot;Clarity Act&quot; ====

After the 1995 referendum very narrowly defeated a proposal on Quebec sovereignty, Chrétien started to champion what eventually become the &quot;Clarity Act&quot; as part of his &quot;Plan B&quot;. In August 1996, the lawyer Guy Bertrand won a ruling in a Quebec court declaring that the sovereignty question was not just a political matter between the federal and Quebec governments, but also a legal matter subject to court rulings. Following that ruling, Chrétien decided that here was a means of defeating the Quebec sovereignty movement and, in September 1996, ordered the Justice Minister Allan Rock to take the question of the legality of Quebec separating to the Supreme Court. Stéphane Dion advised Chrétien that, if the federal government won the reference to the Supreme Court as expected, the government should draft a bill stating the precise rules for Quebec to leave—telling Chrétien if the people of Quebec could be shown how difficult it would be to leave, then support for separatism would fall. Along the same lines, Dion started to send much-publicised open letters to Quebec ministers questioning the assumptions behind the separatist case.

In December 1999 the Chrétien government tabled the &quot;Clarity Act&quot;, which passed Parliament in June 2000. The &quot;Clarity Act&quot;, which was Chrétien&#x27;s response to his narrow victory in the 1995 referendum requires that no Canadian government may acknowledge any province&#x27;s declaration of independence unless a &quot;clear majority&quot; supports a &quot;clear question&quot; about sovereignty in a referendum, as defined by the Parliament of Canada, and a constitutional amendment is passed. The size of a &quot;clear majority&quot; is not specified in the Act. After the &quot;Clarity Act&quot; had passed by the House of Commons in February 2000, a poll showed that the federalist forces enjoyed a 15 percent lead in the polls on the question if Quebec should become independent, which Chrétien argued meant that the sovereignty option was now effectively off the table as Bouchard had always said he would only call another referendum if he could obtain &quot;winning conditions&quot;, which he plainly did not possess at the moment.

=== Domestic affairs ===

In November 1997, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit was held on the University of British Columbia (UBC) campus in Vancouver. Students on UBC&#x27;s campus protested the meeting because of the poor human rights practices of some of the attending leaders; one of the leaders most criticized was Indonesian President Suharto. Demonstrators tore down a barrier and were pepper-sprayed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), with other peaceful demonstrators being subsequently pepper-sprayed as well. There was debate over whether the action was necessary. In response to Suharto&#x27;s concerns about his &quot;dignity&quot; being called into question by protests, the Canadian government had promised him that no protesters would be allowed to get close, and in early August 1997, the PMO informed the RCMP that the prime minister did not wish for any &quot;distractions&quot; at the upcoming conference. On August 7, 2001, the APEC report was issued by Judge Ted Hughes; it cleared Chrétien of wrongdoing, but stated that the PMO&#x27;s Jean Carle had improperly pressured the RCMP to attack the protesters.

In August 1999, the Anglo-Canadian media magnate Conrad Black was due to receive a British peerage. Two days before Black was to receive his title, Chrétien advised Queen Elizabeth II not to accord Black a title of nobility, citing the 1917 Nickle Resolution whereby the Canadian House of Commons asked King George V not to grant any hereditary peerages or knighthoods to Canadians, thereby ensurinng that Black was not raised to the peerage as he was expecting to be. A humiliated Black sued Chrétien for what he alleged to be an abuse of power, leading to the legal case of &quot;Black v Chrétien&quot;. In 2001, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled in Chrétien&#x27;s favour, stating it was the prime minister&#x27;s prerogative to advise the Queen not to raise Canadians to the British peerage if he felt so inclined, and therefore it was not an abuse of power as Black had claimed. Black gave up his Canadian citizenship to accept the title.

==== Electoral affairs ====
In July 2003 Chretien passed a bill to reform the way elections are financed.≥ In the previous century, the political parties were largely left to their own devices. After these changes to the Canada Elections Act (SC 2000), each vote obtained by a party was subsidized. The subsidy entered into effect on January 1, 2004, at $1.75 per vote (indexed to the Consumer Price Index) as part of a set of amendments made by the 37th Canadian Parliament to the Canada Elections Act which for the first time set limits on political contributions by individuals and organizations (corporations, unions, non-profit groups). The per-vote subsidy was introduced to replace the reliance of political parties and candidates on corporate, union, and wealthy donors in order to reduce the political influence of such donors. The law provides a refund for 50% of the expenditure on the most recent election campaign.

==== Social issues ====

In 1995, the Chrétien government introduced and passed the Canadian Firearms Registry, also called the long-gun registry. This would require the registration of all non-restricted firearms in Canada. This gun registry would document and record information of the firearms, their owners, and their owners&#x27; licenses.

The government under Chrétien&#x27;s premiership introduced a new and far-reaching &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot; in April 2003, which replaced the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot; and changed the way youths were prosecuted for crimes in Canada. A flurry of major environmental legislation, including the &quot;Canadian Environmental Protection Act&quot;, &quot;National Marine Conservation Areas Act&quot;, &quot;Pest Control Products Act&quot;, and the &quot;Species at Risk Act&quot; were enacted. The cooperation of federal, provincial, and municipal governments also enabled Vancouver to win the bid to host the 2010 Winter Olympics.

In July 2003, Chrétien reversed his position on gay marriage, which he had previously been opposed to (in 1999 Chrétien had voted for a resolution sponsored by the Reform saying marriage was a union of a man and a woman only). After a Toronto court ruled that laws forbidding homosexual marriage violated the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, legalizing same-sex marriage throughout Ontario, Chrétien embraced the idea of gay marriage and introduced a bill in the House of Commons that would have legalized gay marriage despite the very vocal opposition of the Roman Catholic Church with the bishop of Calgary warning in a sermon that Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;eternal salvation&quot; was at risk.

=== Economic policy ===

Chrétien canceled the privatization of Toronto&#x27;s Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages.

The first budget introduced by Martin, in February 1994, was described as a &quot;mild and tame&quot; budget focused only on the target of reducing the deficit to 3 percent of Gross National Product (GNP) within three years, and brought in modest cuts, mostly to defence spending. Until the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Chrétien government tended to be hostile towards defence spending with the government&#x27;s white paper &quot;Defence 94&quot; declaring that in a post-Cold War world there would be less and less need for armed forces, which accordingly meant reduced budgets for the military. Outside of defence spending, there were few cuts in the 1994 budget. In a radio interview with Ron Collister in March 1994, Chrétien stated: &quot;To go to our goal of 3 per cent of GNP, all the cuts have been announced in the budget. There will not be a new round.&quot; According to the diplomat James Bartleman, Chrétien told him in early 1994 that major cuts to government spending outside of defence were out of the question, and instead he hoped that the economy would grow enough on its own that the deficit would disappear without any cuts. Chrétien&#x27;s plans in early 1994 for economic growth were to increase exports by embracing globalization and free trade with as many nations as possible, arguing that the export offensive would stimulate the economy out of the early 1990s recession. The 1994 budget was widely criticized by journalists such as Andrew Coyne as useless in even achieving its target of reducing the deficit to 3 percent of GNP within three years, let alone eliminating the deficit, and led to a celebrated clash between Coyne and Martin in the boardroom of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper. In April 1994, interest rates in Canada started a steady rise that would continue until early 1995.

Chrétien was not keen on making deep cuts to government spending, but given the crisis caused by the skyrocketing interest rates had decided &quot;reluctantly&quot; there was no alternative. Once he had decided upon making deeper cuts than he promised, Chrétien proved to be firm supporter of the new course, and supported Martin&#x27;s cuts to other departments despite the complaints of the other ministers. Chrétien&#x27;s advisor Eddie Goldenberg later recalled that Chrétien was unyielding in the face of efforts by other ministers to &quot;spare&quot; their departments, and that Chrétien kept on saying &quot;If I change anything, everything will unravel&quot;. In a 2011 interview, Chrétien recalled about the 1995 budget that: &quot;There would have been a day when we would have been the Greece of today. I knew we were in a bind and we had to do something.&quot; In order to silence objections from left-wing Liberal backbenchers and Cabinet ministers, Chrétien ensured that the Program Review Committee chaired by Marcel Massé that would decide what programs to end and which to cut had a majority comprising the leftist MPs Brian Tobin, Sheila Copps, Sergio Marchi and Herb Gray, people who would not normally be supporting cutting programs, and thereby underlined the seriousness of the crisis. It was only with the budget that Martin introduced on February 27, 1995, that the Chrétien government began a policy of cuts designed to eliminate the deficit in order to reassure the markets. Much of the Liberal caucus was deeply unhappy with the 1995 budget, arguing that this was not what they had been elected for in 1993, only to be informed by the prime minister that there was no alternative. Chrétien himself expressed his unhappiness with his budget in a radio interview with Peter Gzowski in March 1995, saying about the budget: &quot;It is not our pleasure sir, I have to tell you that. I&#x27;ve been around a long time. It&#x27;s no pleasure at all. I&#x27;m not doctrinaire, a right-winger. I&#x27;m a Liberal, and I feel like a Liberal, and it is painful. But it is needed&quot;.

The government began a program of deep cuts to provincial transfers and other areas of government finance. During his tenure as prime minister, a $42 billion deficit was eliminated, five consecutive budget surpluses were recorded (thanks in part to favorable economic times), $36 billion in debt was paid down, and taxes were cut by $100 billion (cumulatively) over five years. Using the low incomes cut-offs after tax measure, the percentage of Canadians who had low income in 1993 was 14.1 percent; in 1995, when the budget was introduced, that figure had jumped to 14.5; in 2003, the end of Chrétien&#x27;s time in office, that number had fallen to just 11.6 percent. The share of Canadians living in persistent poverty (i.e. low income for at least 3 years out of 6 years) has declined by almost half since the mid-1990s to 2010. Social spending as a percentage of GDP fell from 20.35 percent in 1993, to 18.35 percent in 1995, eventually falling to 16.94 percent in 1997 and 15.76 percent in 2000, and eventually rising to 16.29 percent in 2003. The 1995 budget, which was called by Peter C. Newman a &quot;watershed document&quot; that marked the first time in recent memory that anybody had made a serious effort to deal with the deficit, won a favorable reaction from the international markets, and a led to an immediate fall in interest rates. There were, however, undeniable costs associated with this endeavour. The cuts resulted in fewer government services, most noticeably in the health care sector, as major reductions in federal funding to the provinces meant significant cuts in service delivery. Moreover, the across-the-board cuts affected the operations and achievement of the mandate of most federal departments. Many of the cuts were restored in later years of Chrétien&#x27;s period in office.

In March 1996, when the Chrétien government presented its third budget, the backbencher Liberal MP John Nunziata voted against the budget under the grounds it failed to repeal the GST as the Liberals had promised in 1993 and singled out for criticism his former Rat Pack colleague Sheila Copps, who had promised during the 1993 election to resign within a year if the GST was not repealed. Chrétien&#x27;s response was to expel Nunziata from the Liberal caucus. However, the expulsion of Nunziata drew attention to the fact that Copps was still in office despite her promise to resign within a year if the GST was not repealed. Chrétien first stated that Copps would stay in Parliament despite her promise of 1993, but then intense public pressure (together with a poll showing Copps would win a by-election) forced Copps to resign from the Parliament. After resigning, Copps then contested the resulting by-election, where she won and then went straight back into the Cabinet. To help defuse anger over the GST issue, in the spring of 1996 the Chrétien government moved to harmonize sales taxes (GST with provincial taxes) by signing an accord with three of the four Atlantic provinces; the other provinces were not interested in the federal offer to harmonize.

In February 1998, for the first time since 1969 a balanced budget was presented by the government. Shortly afterwards, the Chrétien government introduced the National Child Benefit program for the children of low-income parents.

=== Foreign policy ===

==== Canada in the Yugoslav Wars ====

In 1999, Chrétien supported Canada&#x27;s involvement in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) bombing campaign of Yugoslavia over the issue of Kosovo, even through the operation was unsanctioned by the United Nations Security Council. There had been an Anglo-American resolution asking for the Security Council&#x27;s approval of the NATO bombing, but it was vetoed by Russia. The idea of bombing Yugoslavia caused some discomfort within the ranks of the Liberal party as the NATO campaign effectively meant supporting Kosovo separatists against a government determined to prevent Kosovo&#x27;s secession from Yugoslavia. Chrétien was personally uncomfortable with the idea of bombing Yugoslavia, but supported the war because he valued good relations with the United States far more than he cared about Yugoslavia. Chrétien&#x27;s foreign minister at the time, Lloyd Axworthy justified Canada&#x27;s involvement in the bombing of Yugoslavia on the grounds that allegations of massacres against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo made the use of force legitimate on humanitarian grounds, even without the approval of the UN Security Council. Likewise, Chrétien was later to tell Lawrence Martin that it was far better to intervene in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia to stop human rights violations in the Kosovo region by Serbian forces than to do nothing.

==== China ====

Chrétien was known to be a Sinophile and an admirer of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In November 1994, he led the first of four &quot;Team Canada&quot; trade missions comprising himself and nine premiers to China (Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau having declined to go), which had as their stated objective increasing Sino-Canadian trade. The Team Canada mission was meant to be the beginning of the export offensive that would stimulate the economy out of the recession, and also to achieve Chrétien&#x27;s goal going back to the 1970s of a Canadian economy less dependent on trade with the United States. Under his leadership, China and Canada signed several bilateral relations agreements. The Team Canada missions attracted criticism that Chrétien seemed concerned only with economic issues, that he rarely raised the subject of China&#x27;s poor human rights record, and that on the few occasions that he did mention human rights in China he went out of his way to avoid offending his hosts. Moreover, Chrétien attracted criticism for presenting the case for improved human rights in purely economic terms, arguing that a better human rights record would allow China to join the WTO and thus sell more goods to the West. Chrétien argued that there was no point in criticizing China&#x27;s human rights record because the Chinese never listened to such criticism, and instead were greatly annoyed about being lectured by Western leaders about their poor human rights record. Given that Canada could not really do anything to change the views of China&#x27;s leaders about human rights, Chrétien contended that the best that could be done was to improve Sino-Canadian economic relations while ignoring the subject of human rights.

==== United States ====
Chrétien phoned U.S. President Bill Clinton in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects of NAFTA. Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify NAFTA, and if NAFTA was renegotiated, then he would have to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which was not something that he was going to do just for the sake of Chrétien. Clinton informed the prime minister that he could either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and that the most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing a letter saying the United States was not interested in taking over Canada&#x27;s energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton&#x27;s letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton&#x27;s letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only a moral obligation, not a legal one, on the U.S government.

Following the September 11 attacks, Canadian forces joined with multinational to pursue al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. U.S. President George W. Bush had also commended how Canada responded to the crisis. Among them included Operation Yellow Ribbon and the memorial service on Parliament Hill three days after 9/11. In January 2002, Chrétien together with the Defence Minister Art Eggleton were accused of misleading Parliament. When asked in Question Period if Canadian troops had handed over captured Taliban and al-Qaeda members in Afghanistan to the American forces amid concerns about the treatment of POWs at Guantanamo Bay, Chrétien stated this was only a &quot;hypothetical question&quot; that could not be answered as the Canadians had taken no POWs. Critics of the government, such as Joe Clark, then pointed out that in the previous week, &quot;The Globe &amp; Mail&quot; had run on its front page a photo of Canadian soldiers turning over POWs to American troops. Eggleton claimed that he had only learned of the policy of handing over POWs several days after the photo had appeared in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. When pressed by opposition critics about his apparent ignorance of what was Canada&#x27;s policy on turning over POWs captured in Afghanistan, Eggleton then claimed that he had not only forgotten that he had been briefed by senior bureaucrats that Canadian Forces were to hand over POWs to the Americans, but that he had also forgotten to inform the Cabinet.

One year after the 9/11 attacks, Chrétien gave controversial remarks about what led to the attacks, suggesting they were a reaction to Western foreign policy. During the 2002 CBC interview, Chrétien said &quot;I do think that the Western world is getting too rich in relations to the poor world. And necessarily, we&#x27;re looked upon as being arrogant, self-satisfied, greedy and with no limits. And the 11th of September is an occasion for me to realize it even more. When you are powerful like you are, you guys, it&#x27;s the time to be nice. And it is one of the problems—you cannot exercise your powers to the point of humiliation of the others. And that is what the Western world—not only the Americans but the Western world—has to realize.&quot; The comments were condemned by the new Official Opposition leader and the new Canadian Alliance leader, Stephen Harper, who charged Chretien with victim blaming, while the leaders of the New Democratic Party and Progressive Conservative Party did not interpret Chrétien&#x27;s comments as critical of the United States.

==== Refusal to join the Iraq War ====

Chrétien&#x27;s government did not support the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. His reasoning was that the war lacked UN Security Council sanction; while not a member of the Security Council, Canada nevertheless attempted to build a consensus for a resolution authorizing the use of force after a short (two- to three-month) extension to UN weapon inspections in Iraq. Critics also noted that, while in opposition, he had also opposed the first US-led Gulf War, which had been approved by the UN Security Council and in 1999 supported NATO air strikes against Serbia, which had no Security Council approval. In order to avoid damaging relations with the United States, Chrétien agreed to another and larger deployment of Canadian troops to Afghanistan on February 12, 2003, in order to prove that Canada was still a good American ally, despite opposing the upcoming Iraq war. Canada sent 2,000 soldiers to Afghanistan in the summer of 2003. Twenty years later, in a French-language interview, Chretien recalled the personalities and events that led up to his refusal. At the time some in the business community were petrified that the US would look elsewhere for Canadian products; 85% of Canadian trade was with the US.

=== Defence policy ===

In 1993, Chrétien canceled the contract to buy the EH-101 helicopters, requiring the search for new helicopters to start over, and paid a $478 million termination fee to AgustaWestland.

In January 1998, Chrétien&#x27;s government announced that the CH-113 helicopters would be replaced by a scaled-down search-and-rescue variant of the EH101, carrying the designation CH-149 Cormorant. Unlike the Petrel/Chimo contract which Chrétien had cancelled in 1993, these 15 aircraft were to be built entirely in Europe with no Canadian participation or industrial incentives. The first two aircraft arrived in Canada in September 2001 and entered service the following year. His Maritime Helicopter Project was supposed to find a low-cost replacement aircraft. The candidates were the Sikorsky S-92, the NHIndustries NH90 and the EH-101, although critics accused the government of designing the project so as to prevent AgustaWestland from winning the contract. A winner, the Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone, would not be announced until after Chrétien retired.

=== Reelections ===
==== 1997 federal election ====
Chrétien called an early election in the spring of 1997, hoping to take advantage of his position in the public opinion polls and the continued division of the conservative vote between the Progressive Conservative Party and the upstart Reform Party of Canada. Despite slipping poll numbers, he advised the governor general to call an election in 1997, a year ahead of schedule. Many of his own MPs criticized him for this move, especially in light of the devastating Red River Flood, which led to charges of insensitivity. Liberal MP John Godfrey tried hard to interest Chrétien in an ambitious plan to eliminate urban poverty in Canada as a platform to run on in the election, which was vetoed by Eddie Goldenberg and John Rae of the PMO, who convinced Chrétien that it was better to stick with an &quot;incrementalist&quot; course of small changes than risk any grand project. The Progressive Conservatives had a popular new leader in Jean Charest and the New Democrats&#x27; Alexa McDonough led her party to a breakthrough in Atlantic Canada, where the Liberals had won all but one seat in 1993. Chrétien benefited when the Reform Party aired a TV ad in English Canada charging that the country was being dominated by French-Canadian politicians, which Chrétien used to accuse Preston Manning of being anti-French. In 1997, the Liberals lost all but a handful of seats in Atlantic Canada and Western Canada, but managed to retain a bare majority government due to their continued dominance of Ontario.

==== 2000 federal election ====
Chrétien called another early election in the fall of 2000, again hoping to take advantage of the split in the Canadian right and catch the newly formed Canadian Alliance and its neophyte leader Stockwell Day off guard. At the funeral of Pierre Trudeau in September 2000, the Cuban President, Fidel Castro happened to meet with Day. Later that same day, Chrétien met with Castro, where Chrétien asked Castro about his assessment of Day and if he should call an early election or not. Castro advised Chrétien to dissolve Parliament early as he considered Day to be a lightweight, and as Castro was a leader whom Chrétien respected, his advice was an important reason for the election. Finance Minister Paul Martin released a &#x27;mini-budget&#x27; just before the election call that included significant tax cuts, a move aimed at undermining the Alliance position going into the campaign. Chrétien formed a &quot;war room&quot; comprising his communications director Françoise Ducros, Warren Kinsella, Duncan Fulton and Kevin Bosch to gather material to attack Day as a right-wing extremist. In the first weeks of the 2000 election, the Canadian Alliance gained in the polls and some voters complained that Chrétien overstayed his time in office and had no agenda beyond staying in power for the sake of staying in power. The fact that the Red Book of 2000 consisted almost entirely of recycled promises from the Red Books of 1993 and 1997 and various banal statements further reinforced the impression of a prime minister with no plans or vision for Canada and whose only agenda was to hang onto power as long as possible. However, the Liberal claim that Day planned to dismantle the health care system to replace it with a &quot;two-tier&quot; health care system along with a number of gaffes on Day&#x27;s part in addition to Alliance candidate Betty Granger warning that Canada was faced with the threat of an &quot;Asian invasion&quot; (which furthered the Liberals&#x27; plan to paint the Alliance as a xenophobic and extreme right-wing party) started to turn opinion decisively against the Canadian Alliance. Day&#x27;s socially conservative views were also attacked by Chrétien as the Liberals claimed that Day would make homosexuality and abortion illegal. The New Democrats and Bloc Québécois also ran lacklustre campaigns, while the Progressive Conservatives, led by former Prime Minister Joe Clark, struggled to retain official party status. On November 27, the Liberals secured a strong majority mandate in the 2000 election, winning nearly as many seats as they had in 1993, largely thanks to significant gains in Quebec and in Atlantic Canada. Without Jean Charest as leader, the PCs who had done well in winning the popular vote in Quebec in 1997 fared poorly in 2000, and most of their voters defected over to the Liberals.

=== Scandals and controversies ===

==== Shawinigate ====

In late 2000 and early 2001, politics were dominated by questions about the Grand-Mere Affair (or the Shawinigate scandal). Opposition parties frequently charged that Chrétien had broken the law in regards to his lobbying for Business Development Bank of Canada for loans to the Auberge Grand-Mère inn. Questions were especially centered around the firing of the president of the bank, François Beaudoin, and the involvement of Jean Carle, formerly of the PMO, in sacking Beaudoin. Carle served as Chrétien&#x27;s chief of operations between 1993 and 1998 before leaving to take up an executive post at the Business Development Bank. Chrétien claimed that Carle was not involved in any way with the loans to the Grand-Mere Inn, only to be countered by Joe Clark, who produced a leaked document showing that he was. After initial denials, Chrétien acknowledged having lobbied the Business Development Bank to grant a $2 million loan to Yvon Duhaime. Duhaime was a friend and constituent to whom the Prime Minister stated that he had sold his interest in the Grand-Mère Inn, a local Shawinigan-area hotel and golf resort, eventually providing evidence of the sale—a contract written on a cocktail napkin. Duhaime was a local businessman with an unsavoury reputation and a criminal record, who received a loan from the Business Development Bank that he was ineligible to collect on the account of his criminal record (Duhaime did not mention his record when applying for the loan). The bank had turned down the initial loan application, but later approved a $615,000 loan following further lobbying by Chrétien. When the bank refused to extend the loan in August 1999 under the grounds that Duhaime had a bad financial history, Beaudoin was fired by Chrétien in September 1999, which led to a wrongful dismissal suit that Beaudoin was to win in 2004. It was revealed that Chrétien had never been paid for his share in the sale of the adjoining golf course, and criminal charges were laid against Duhaime. On February 19, 2001, the RCMP announced that there they did not find sufficient evidence to lay criminal charges against anyone in regards to the Grand-Mere Affair, and Chrétien accused Clark of waging a &quot;witch hunt&quot; against the Liberals. On March 2, 2001, the federal ethics counselor Howard Wilson cleared Chrétien of wrongdoing in the Grand-Mere Affair. On April 5, 2001, the &quot;National Post&quot; received documents purportedly from an anonymous source within the bank, indicating that Chrétien was still owed $23,040 by Duhaime for his share in the Auberge Grand-Mère. The revelation of the Grand-Mère affair did not affect the outcome of the 2000 election. Chrétien and his circle believed that the breaking of the Grand-Mère story was the work of the Martin faction.

==== Sponsorship Scandal ====

The major controversy of the later Chrétien years was the Sponsorship Scandal, which involved more than $100 million distributed from the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office to Quebec&#x27;s federalist and Liberal Party interests without much accountability. On May 8, 2002, the Sponsorship Scandal broke when the auditor general, Sheila Fraser, issued a report accusing Public Works bureaucrats of having broken &quot;just about every rule in the book&quot; in awarding $1.6 million to the Montreal ad firm Groupaction Marketing Inc. The money awarded to Groupaction in three dubious contracts appeared to have disappeared, and the firm had a long history of donating to the Liberals. Opposition critics further suggested that the public works minister at the time, Alfonso Gagliano, whom Chrétien had praised as a great patriot, was not just a mere bystander to questionable contacts associated with the sponsorship program that Fraser had identified. In response to the public outrage, Chrétien argued in a speech in Winnipeg that all this was necessary to stop Quebec separatism and justified by the results, stating that: &quot;Perhaps there was a few million dollars that might have been stolen in the process. It is possible. But how many millions of dollars have we saved the country because we have re-established the stability of Canada as a united country? If somebody has stolen the money, they will face the courts. But I will not apologize to Canadians.&quot; Chrétien&#x27;s argument that he had nothing to apologize for in regards to the sponsorship program, and his apparent condoning of corruption as justified by the results of saving Canada fared poorly with the Canadian public, which increasingly started to perceive the prime minister as an autocratic leader with a thuggish streak. A poll taken later in May 2002 showed that over half of Canadians believed that the Chrétien government was corrupt. The Sponsorship Scandal would tarnish Chrétien&#x27;s reputation only a few years after he left office, and contributed to the Liberals losing their majority government in 2004 and losing power altogether in 2006.

=== Chrétien and Martin: Liberal Party infighting ===

Relations between Chrétien and Martin were frequently strained, and Martin was reportedly angling to replace Chrétien as early as 1997. Martin had long hoped that Chrétien would just retire at the end of his second term, thereby allowing him to win the Liberal leadership, and was greatly disappointed in January 2000 when Chrétien&#x27;s communications director Françoise Ducros had fired &quot;a shot across the bow&quot; by confirming what had been strongly hinted at since the summer of 1999 in an announcement to the caucus that Chrétien would seek a third term.

Chrétien was due to face a leadership review in February 2002, but the Liberal national executive, which was controlled by partisans of Paul Martin, agreed to Chrétien&#x27;s request in early January 2001 that the leadership review be pushed back to February 2003. In agreeing to this request, Martin believed that this was the &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for allowing Chrétien a decent interval to retire with dignity sometime in 2002, an interpretation that Chrétien did not hold.

==== Rebellion and resignation ====

By early 2002, the long-simmering feud with Martin came to a head. A particular concern that had badly strained relations between the prime minister and the finance minister by early 2002 was Martin&#x27;s control of the Liberal Party apparatus, especially his control over the issuing of membership forms, which he reserved largely for his own supporters. In January 2002, Brian Tobin complained to Chrétien that the Liberal Party machinery had been &quot;captured&quot; by Martin&#x27;s followers to the extent that it was now virtually impossible for anyone else to sign up their own followers. This posed a major problem for Chrétien as the Liberals were due to hold a leadership review in February 2003. However, it was still quite possible that Chrétien would win the review by a slim margin.

In January 2002, an incident occurred which was to greatly damage Chrétien&#x27;s relations with the Liberal caucus. After Chrétien reorganized the Cabinet in late January 2002, Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett criticised Chrétien at a caucus meeting for not appointing more women to the Cabinet. Chrétien exploded with rage at Bennett&#x27;s criticism, saying that as a mere backbencher she did not have the right to criticise the prime minister in front of the caucus, and attacked her with such fury that Bennett collapsed in tears. In February 2002, reflecting a growing number of Liberal MPs&#x27; displeasure with Chrétien, the Liberal caucus elected the outspoken pro-Martin MP Stan Keyes (who had already openly mused in 2001 about how it was time for Chrétien to go) as their chairman, who defeated pro-Chrétien MP Steve Mahoney. Chrétien had expected Mahoney to win, and was reported to be shocked when he learned of Keyes&#x27;s victory, which now gave Martin more control of the caucus.
In late May 2002, Chrétien tried to curtail Martin&#x27;s campaign for the leadership of the party by delivering a lecture to Cabinet to stop raising money for leadership bids within the Liberal Party. At what was described as a &quot;stormy&quot; Cabinet meeting on May 30, 2002, Chrétien stated that he intended to serve out his entire term, and ordered the end of all leadership fundraising. Martin left his cabinet on June 2, 2002. Martin claimed that Chrétien dismissed him from Cabinet, while Chrétien said that Martin had resigned. In his memoirs, Chrétien wrote that he regretted not having fired Martin a few years earlier.

Martin&#x27;s departure generated a severe backlash from Martin&#x27;s supporters, who controlled much of the party machinery, and all signs indicated that they were prepared to oust Chrétien at a leadership review in February 2003. To win the leadership review, Chrétien formed a team in early June 2002 comprising his close associates John Rae, David Collenette, Jean Carle, and David Smith who were ordered to sign up as many pro-Chrétien (&quot;Chrétienist&quot;) Liberals as possible for the leadership review. The open split, which was covered extensively on national media, increasingly painted Chrétien as a lame duck. During the summer of 2002, a number of backbencher Liberal MPs associated with Martin started to openly criticise Chrétien&#x27;s leadership, calling on him to resign now or suffer the humiliation of losing the leadership review. Chrétien asked Jim Karygiannis, who had been so effective in signing up supporters for him in 1990 to repeat that performance, only to be told by Karygiannis that Chrétien had never rewarded him by appointing him to the Cabinet as he asked for many times over the years, had not even returned his phone calls to set up a meeting to discuss his possible appointment to the Cabinet and that he was now a Martin man. Karygiannis then called a press conference on July 13, 2002, where he called for Chrétien to retire &quot;with dignity&quot;, rather than risk losing a potentially divisive leadership review and avoid having his career end that way.

After less than half the caucus committed to support him in August 2002 by signing a letter indicating their support for the prime minister in the up-coming leadership review, Chrétien announced that he would not lead the party into the next election, and set his resignation date for February 2004. Martin was not happy with the 2004 departure date, preferring that Chrétien retire at the end of 2002, but considered it better if Chrétien were to retire than having to defeat him at the 2003 leadership review, which would have been more divisive and would have established the ominous precedent of a prime minister being ousted by his own party for no other reason other that someone else wanted the job. Due to mounting pressure from the Martin camp, Chrétien no longer saw his February 2004 resignation date as tenable. His final sitting in the House of Commons took place on November 6, 2003. He made an emotional farewell to the party on November 13 at the 2003 Liberal leadership convention. The following day, Martin was elected his successor. On December 12, 2003, Chrétien formally resigned as prime minister, handing power over to Martin. Chrétien joined the law firm, Heenan Blaikie on January 5, 2004, as counsel. The firm announced he would work out of its Ottawa offices four days per week and make a weekly visit to the Montreal office. In early 2004, there occurred much in-fighting within the Liberal Party with several Liberal MPs associated with Chrétien such as Sheila Copps and Charles Caccia losing their nomination battles against Martin loyalists.

==Retirement==

On February 18, 2004, François Beaudoin won his wrongful dismissal suit against the Business Development Bank of Canada. Justice Andre Denis ruled in favor of Beaudoin&#x27;s claim that he was fired for political reasons in 1999 for trying to call the loan on the Grand Mère Inn, ruled that Chrétien&#x27;s former aide Jean Carle and Michel Vennat was guilty of making false criminal and civil charges of wrongdoing against Beaudoin to discredit him for suing the bank, accused Carle of committing perjury during the trial and declared given the &quot;unspeakable injustice&quot; Beaudoin had suffered, told the government not to appeal his ruling because they would be wasting the tax-payers&#x27; money if they did. The lingering repercussions of the sponsorship scandal of 2002 reduced the Liberal Party to a minority in the 2004 election, may have strengthened the separatist case, and contributed to the government&#x27;s defeat in the 2006 election. The scandal led to long-running, deep investigations by the RCMP, a federal inquiry, the Gomery Commission, chaired by Justice John Gomery (called by Martin in 2004), and several prosecutions and convictions; the legal process continued to late 2011, more than a decade after the scandal began.

Jean Chrétien testified for the Gomery Commission regarding the sponsorship scandal in February 2005. Earlier that year his lawyers tried, but failed, to have Justice John Gomery removed from the commission, arguing that he lacked objectivity. Chrétien contends that the Gomery Commission was set up to tarnish his image, and that it was not a fair investigation. He cites comments Gomery made calling him &quot;small town cheap&quot;, referring to the management of the sponsorship program as &quot;catastrophically bad&quot;, and calling Chuck Guité a &quot;charming scamp&quot;. Subsequent to the release of the first report, Chrétien has decided to take an action in Federal Court to review the commission report on the grounds that Gomery showed a &quot;reasonable apprehension of bias&quot;, and that some conclusions didn&#x27;t have an &quot;evidentiary&quot; basis. Chrétien believes that the appointment of Bernard Roy, a former chief of staff to former PC prime minister Brian Mulroney, as chief counsel for the commission was a mistake, as he failed to call some relevant witnesses such as Don Boudria and Ralph Goodale. In his report of November 1, 2005, on responsibility for the sponsorship scandal, Justice Gomery ruled that Chrétien was not responsible for the awarding of advertising contracts in Quebec in which millions were stolen, but did accept Charles Guité&#x27;s claim that he received his instructions on what program to sponsor and to spend how much money on each program from Jean Pelletier, the chief of staff at the PMO between 1993 and 2001 and Jean Carle, the director of operations at the PMO between 1993 and 1998 as the truth.
In April 2007, Chrétien and Canadian book publishers Knopf Canada and Éditions du Boréal announced they would be publishing his memoirs, &quot;My Years as Prime Minister&quot;, which would recount Chrétien&#x27;s tenure as prime minister. The book was announced under the title of &quot;A Passion for Politics&quot;. It arrived in bookstores in October 2007, in both English and French, but the promotional tour was delayed due to heart surgery. As well &quot;Straight from the Heart&quot; was republished with a new preface and two additional chapters detailing his return to politics as the leader of the Liberal Party and his victory in the election of 1993. Publisher Key Porter Books timed the re-issuing to coincide with the publication of &quot;My Years as Prime Minister&quot;.

On October 1, 2007, Chrétien was playing at the Royal Montreal Golf Club, north of Montreal, at a charity golf event. Playing alongside a cardiologist, he mentioned his discomfort, saying he &quot;had been suffering some symptoms for some time&quot; and the doctor advised he come for a check up. After examination, Chrétien was hospitalized at the Montreal Heart Institute, with unstable angina, a sign a heart attack might be imminent. He underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery as a result on the morning of October 3, 2007. The operation forced Chrétien to delay a promotional tour for his book. He was &quot;expected to have a full and complete recovery&quot;.

In November 2008, Chrétien and former NDP leader Ed Broadbent came out of retirement to negotiate a formal coalition agreement between the Liberals, the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Québécois, the first power-sharing coalition since the Union government of 1917–1918 founded in response to the conscription crisis caused by World War I, in a bid to form a new government to replace the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Harper&#x27;s request to prorogue parliament was granted by Governor General Michaëlle Jean, staving off the opposition&#x27;s scheduled motion of non-confidence.

On August 5, 2010, Chrétien complained of experiencing difficulty walking, and was admitted to a hospital. A brain scan was conducted the next day, and it revealed that a 3 centimeter wide subdural hematoma was pushing 1.5 centimeters into his brain. Emergency surgery was then performed that afternoon, and the blood was successfully drained. He was released from hospital on August 9, 2010. Doctors, who were impressed with the speed of his recovery, ordered him to rest for two to four weeks.

Chrétien&#x27;s name was rumoured as a replacement for Kofi Annan as secretary-general of the United Nations.

Chrétien is a member of the Fondation Chirac&#x27;s honour committee, ever since the foundation was launched in 2008 by former French president Jacques Chirac in order to promote world peace. He is also a member of the Club de Madrid, a group of former leaders from democratic countries, that works to strengthen democracy and respond to global crises. Jean Chrétien is also an Honorary Member of The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.

Chrétien is named in the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment that were leaked to the German newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;.

Chrétien was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on June 29, 2007. He was appointed to the Order of Merit by Queen Elizabeth II in July 2009 and received the insignia of the order from the Queen on October 20, 2009.

In December 2011, Chrétien claimed that the Conservative Party and their majority government would overturn the legalization of same-sex marriage and abortion. In March 2013, Chrétien criticized Stephen Harper&#x27;s foreign policy, sparking some debate about the different degrees of influence Canada has held in foreign affairs under the two prime ministers. On September 12, 2015, Chrétien published an open letter to Canadian voters in multiple newspapers in which he criticized Harper&#x27;s response to the European migrant crisis, stating that Harper has turned Canada into a &quot;cold hearted&quot; nation and he has &quot;shamed Canada&quot;. &quot;I am sad to see that in fewer than 10 years, the Harper government has tarnished almost 60 years of Canada&#x27;s reputation as a builder of peace and progress.&quot;, Chrétien stated before imploring voters to topple the Harper government in the upcoming election.

In October 2021, Chrétien faced controversy during a promotional press interview for his recent book publication in which he denied having knowledge of the ongoing abuse happening to indigenous children in residential schools during his time as Indian Affairs Minister. He went on to compare the experience of Indian Residential Schools, which inflicted lifelong psychological and physical trauma and led either directly or indirectly to the deaths of thousands of children who attended the schools, to his own experience at a private boarding school. NDP MP Charlie Angus contested that the residential school abuse was reported to the department while Chrétien was minister, citing a letter from a teacher at St. Anne&#x27;s Residential School in Fort Albany, Ont. It was dated 1968. In it, the teacher told him &quot;that crimes are being committed against children,&quot; and &quot;that he as Indian affairs minister had to step up and do something.&quot; Chrétien never responded.

In September 2022, Chrétien attended Elizabeth II&#x27;s state funeral, along with other former Canadian prime ministers.

==Legacy==

Chrétien was ranked the 9th greatest prime minister in a survey of Canadian scholars in 1999, which appeared in &quot;Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada&#x27;s Leaders&quot; by J.L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; has consistently ranked Chrétien in the top ten on their assessments of Canadian prime ministers; he was ranked 9th greatest in 1997, 6th greatest in 2011 and 7th greatest in 2016.

Writing in &quot;Policy Options&quot;, historian and author Bob Plamondon pointed out that &quot;After demonizing Chrétien, Quebec nationalists could not reconcile themselves to the reality that he gave their province new tools to protect the French language and culture. Canada had not been as united in the previous 50 years as when Chrétien left office. Economists were left to wonder how Chrétien turned around the national finances without triggering a recession. Canadians said in a survey that staying out of Iraq was the country&#x27;s greatest foreign policy achievement. University presidents still marvel at how Chrétien rebuilt Canada&#x27;s intellectual infrastructure, turning a brain drain into a brain gain.&quot;

Historian Michael Bliss wrote that Chrétien was &quot;moderately competent and only moderately corrupt.&quot; Bliss also wrote, &quot;Jean Chrétien&#x27;s career shows how much can be accomplished in Canadian politics by someone who is ambitious, hard-working, and has good luck — even if they speak English with a very thick accent.&quot;

<doc id="75629" wikidata="Q127380" url="?curid=75629" title="Abstract syntax tree">
<text>An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a data structure used in computer science to represent the structure of a program or code snippet. It is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of text (often source code) written in a formal language. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the text. It is sometimes called just a syntax tree.

The syntax is &quot;abstract&quot; in the sense that it does not represent every detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the structural or content-related details. For instance, grouping parentheses are implicit in the tree structure, so these do not have to be represented as separate nodes. Likewise, a syntactic construct like an if-condition-then statement may be denoted by means of a single node with three branches.

This distinguishes abstract syntax trees from concrete syntax trees, traditionally designated parse trees. Parse trees are typically built by a parser during the source code translation and compiling process. Once built, additional information is added to the AST by means of subsequent processing, e.g., contextual analysis.

Abstract syntax trees are also used in program analysis and program transformation systems.

== Application in compilers ==
Abstract syntax trees are data structures widely used in compilers to represent the structure of program code. An AST is usually the result of the syntax analysis phase of a compiler. It often serves as an intermediate representation of the program through several stages that the compiler requires, and has a strong impact on the final output of the compiler.

=== Motivation ===
An AST has several properties that aid the further steps of the compilation process:
* An AST can be edited and enhanced with information such as properties and annotations for every element it contains. Such editing and annotation is impossible with the source code of a program, since it would imply changing it.
* Compared to the source code, an AST does not include inessential punctuation and delimiters (braces, semicolons, parentheses, etc.).
* An AST usually contains extra information about the program, due to the consecutive stages of analysis by the compiler. For example, it may store the position of each element in the source code, allowing the compiler to print useful error messages.

Languages are often ambiguous by nature. In order to avoid this ambiguity, programming languages are often specified as a context-free grammar (CFG). However, there are often aspects of programming languages that a CFG can&#x27;t express, but are part of the language and are documented in its specification. These are details that require a context to determine their validity and behaviour. For example, if a language allows new types to be declared, a CFG cannot predict the names of such types nor the way in which they should be used. Even if a language has a predefined set of types, enforcing proper usage usually requires some context. Another example is duck typing, where the type of an element can change depending on context. Operator overloading is yet another case where correct usage and final function are context-dependent.

=== Design ===
The design of an AST is often closely linked with the design of a compiler and its expected features.

Core requirements include the following:

* Variable types must be preserved, as well as the location of each declaration in source code.
* The order of executable statements must be explicitly represented and well defined.
* Left and right components of binary operations must be stored and correctly identified.
* Identifiers and their assigned values must be stored for assignment statements.

These requirements can be used to design the data structure for the AST.

Some operations will always require two elements, such as the two terms for addition. However, some language constructs require an arbitrarily large number of children, such as argument lists passed to programs from the command shell. As a result, an AST used to represent code written in such a language has to also be flexible enough to allow for quick addition of an unknown quantity of children.

To support compiler verification it should be possible to unparse an AST into source code form. The source code produced should be sufficiently similar to the original in appearance and identical in execution, upon recompilation.
The AST is used intensively during semantic analysis, where the compiler checks for correct usage of the elements of the program and the language. The compiler also generates symbol tables based on the AST during semantic analysis. A complete traversal of the tree allows verification of the correctness of the program.

After verifying correctness, the AST serves as the base for code generation. The AST is often used to generate an intermediate representation (IR), sometimes called an intermediate language, for the code generation.
== Other usages ==

=== AST differencing ===
AST differencing, or for short tree differencing, consists of computing the list of differences between two ASTs. This list of differences is typically called an edit script. The edit script directly refers to the AST of the code. For instance, an edit action may result in the addition of a new AST node representing a function. 

=== Clone detection ===
An AST is a powerful abstraction to perform code clone detection.

<text>In Norse mythology, or (; ), often anglicized Nidhogg, is a worm (dragon) who gnaws at the roots of the world tree, Yggdrasil.

== Etymology ==
While the suffix of the name, &quot;-höggr&quot;, literally &quot;hewer&quot;, clearly means &quot;biter, striker&quot;, etc, the prefix is not as clear. In particular, the length of the first vowel is not determined in the original sources. Some scholars prefer the reading &quot;Striker in the Dark&quot;.

In historical Viking society, níð was a term for a social stigma, implying the loss of honor and the status of a villain. Thus, its name might refer to its role as a horrific monster in its action of chewing the corpses of the inhabitants of Niflheim: those guilty of murder, adultery, and oath-breaking, thus something akin to &quot;Malice Biter&quot;.

=== Orthography ===
In the standardized Old Norse orthography, the name is spelled &#x27;, but the letter &#x27; is frequently replaced with the Modern Icelandic &quot;&quot; for reasons of familiarity or technical expediency.

The name can be represented in English texts with &quot;i&quot; for &quot;í&quot;; &quot;th&quot;, &quot;d&quot; or (rarely) &quot;dh&quot; for &quot;ð&quot;; &quot;o&quot; for &quot;ǫ&quot; and optionally without &quot;r&quot; as in Modern Scandinavian reflexes. The Modern Icelandic form &#x27; is also sometimes seen, with special characters or similarly anglicized. The Danish forms &#x27; and &#x27; can also be encountered; or Norwegian &#x27; and Swedish &quot;&quot;. The English cognate would be Nithhewer.

==Prose Edda==

According to the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; part of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Níðhǫggr is a being which gnaws one of the three roots of Yggdrasill. It is sometimes believed that the roots are trapping the beast from the world. This root is placed over Niflheimr and Níðhǫggr gnaws it from beneath. The same source also says that &quot;[t]he squirrel called Ratatoskr runs up and down the length of the Ash, bearing envious words between the eagle and Nídhǫggr [the snake].&quot;

In the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; Snorri specifies Níðhǫggr as a serpent in a list of names of such creatures:

:These are names for serpents: dragon, Fafnir, Jormungand, adder, Nidhogg, snake, viper, Goinn, Moinn, Grafvitnir, Grabak, Ofnir, Svafnir, masked one.

Snorri&#x27;s knowledge of Níðhǫggr seems to come from two of the Eddic poems: &quot;Grímnismál&quot; and &quot;Völuspá&quot;.

Later in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Snorri includes Níðhǫggr in a list of various terms and names for swords.

==Poetic Edda==

The poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; identifies a number of beings which live in Yggdrasill. The tree suffers great hardship from all the creatures which live on it. The poem identifies Níðhǫggr as tearing at the tree from beneath and also mentions Ratatoskr as carrying messages between Níðhǫggr and the eagle who lives at the top of the tree. Snorri Sturluson often quotes Grímnismál and clearly used it as his source for this information.

The poem &quot;Völuspá&quot; mentions Níðhöggr/Níðhǫggr twice. The first instance is in its description of Náströnd.

Níðhöggr/Níðhǫggr is also mentioned at the end of &quot;Völuspá&quot;, where he is identified as a dragon and a serpent.

The context and meaning of this stanza are disputed. The most prevalent opinion is that the arrival of Níðhǫggr heralds Ragnarök and thus that the poem ends on a tone of ominous warning. It could be, however, as the prevalent themes of Norse mythology are those of change and renewal, that this could be a &#x27;redemption&#x27; of the serpent, &#x27;shedding&#x27; the corpses and beginning life anew, much like a macabre Phoenix, or perhaps, lifting the bodies of the righteous rulers mentioned two stanzas before (the stanza immediately before is considered spurious by translator Henry Adam Bellows), so that they can dwell in Gimle, and then either Níðhǫggr sinks, or the völva sinks, depending on the translation, and the poem ends.

Níðhǫggr is not mentioned elsewhere in any ancient source.

<doc id="75643" wikidata="Q61227" url="?curid=75643" title="Petra Kelly">
<text>Petra Karin Kelly (29 November 1947 – 1 October 1992) was a German Green politician and ecofeminist activist. She was a founding member of the German Green Party, the first Green party to rise to prominence both nationally in Germany and worldwide. In 1982, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for &quot;forging and implementing a new vision uniting ecological concerns with disarmament, social justice and human rights.&quot;

== Early life and education ==

Petra Karin Lehmann was born in Günzburg, Bavaria in 1947. She changed her name to Kelly after her mother married John E. Kelly, a US Army officer. She was educated in a Catholic convent in Günzburg and later attended school in Georgia and Virginia after her family relocated to the United States in 1959. She lived and studied in the United States until her return to West Germany in 1970. She retained her West German citizenship throughout her life.

Kelly admired Martin Luther King Jr., and campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey in the 1968 U.S. elections. She studied political science at the School of International Service at American University (Washington, D.C.), from which she graduated in 1970 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. She also graduated from the European Institute at the University of Amsterdam in 1971 with a master&#x27;s degree.

== Career ==

While working at the European Commission (Brussels, Belgium, 1971–83), Kelly participated in numerous peace and environmental campaigns in Germany and other countries.

After working for two years at the European Commission, she moved to an administrative post at the Economic and Social Committee, where she championed women&#x27;s rights.

=== German Green Party ===

Kelly was one of the founders of &quot;Die Grünen&quot;, the German Green Party in 1979. In 1983 she was elected to the Bundestag via the Electoral list as a Member of the Bundestag representing Bavaria. She was subsequently re-elected in 1987 with a higher share of the vote.

In 1981, Kelly was involved in a protest of 400,000 people in Bonn against nuclear weapons. In 1982, Gerhard Schröder wrote a contribution in &quot;Die Zeit&quot; for the book &quot;Prinzip Leben&quot;, edited by Kelly and Jo Leinen, which discussed ecological problems and a possible nuclear war.

In the same year, Kelly received the Right Livelihood Award &quot;...for forging and implementing a new vision uniting ecological concerns with disarmament, social justice, and human rights.&quot;

On 12 May 1983, Kelly, Gert Bastian and three other Green Bundestag members unfurled a banner on Alexanderplatz in East Berlin, which said &quot;&quot;The Greens – Swords to Ploughshares&quot;.&quot; After being briefly arrested, they met with East German opposition parties. The East German authorities tolerated this since the West German Greens repudiated the NATO Double-Track Decision. In October 1983, Erich Honecker, the leader of the German Democratic Republic, met Petra Kelly, Gert Bastian and other Greens. Kelly wore a pullover with the words &quot;Swords to Ploughshares&quot; on it. She demanded the release of all prisoners of the East German peace movement and asked Honecker why he repressed something in the GDR which he supported in the West.

Kelly wrote the book &quot;Fighting for Hope&quot; in 1984, published by South End Press. The book is an urgent call for a world free from violence between North and South, men and women, ourselves and our environment.

In the final years of her life, Kelly became increasingly estranged from most of her party colleagues owing to the pragmatic turn taken by the Greens at the time, while she continued to oppose any alliance with traditional political parties.

== Death ==

On 19 October 1992, the decomposed bodies of Kelly and her partner, ex-general and Green politician Gert Bastian (born 1923), were discovered in the bedroom of her house in Bonn by police officials after they received a call from both Bastian&#x27;s wife and Kelly&#x27;s grandmother who reported that they had not heard from either Bastian or Kelly for a few weeks. The police determined that Kelly was shot dead while sleeping by Bastian, who then died of suicide. She was 44, he was 69. The last time anyone heard from the couple was on 30 September 1992 when Kelly sent a parcel to her grandmother. Police estimated the deaths had most likely occurred on 1 October but the exact time of death could not be pinpointed owing to the delay in finding the bodies and their resultant state of decomposition. Kelly was buried in the Waldfriedhof (forest cemetery) in Würzburg, near the village of Heidingsfeld in Lower Franconia, Bavaria.

== Honors ==

* 1982: Right Livelihood Award
*In 2006 Kelly was placed 45th in the UK Environment Agency&#x27;s all-time list of scientists, campaigners, writers, economists and naturalists who, in its view, have done the most to save the planet. Kelly was positioned between the tropical ecologist Mike Hands and the national parks visionary John Dower.

<text>Carl Hiaasen (; born March 12, 1953) is an American journalist and novelist. He began his career as a newspaper reporter and by the late 1970s had begun writing novels in his spare time, both for adults and for middle grade readers. Two of his novels have been made into feature films, and one has been made into a TV series.

Hiaasen&#x27;s adult novels are humorous crime thrillers set in Florida. They feature casts of eccentric, sometimes grotesque characters and satirize aspects of American popular culture. Many of the novels include themes related to environmentalism and political corruption in his native state.

== Early life and education ==
The first of four children born to Odel and Patricia Hiaasen, Hiaasen was born in 1953 of Norwegian and Irish ancestry. Raised in Plantation, Florida, then a rural suburb of Fort Lauderdale, he started writing at age six when his father gave him a typewriter for Christmas. After graduating from Plantation High School in 1970, he entered Emory University, where he contributed satirical humor columns to the student newspaper &quot;The Emory Wheel&quot;. In 1972, he transferred to the University of Florida, where he wrote for &quot;The Independent Florida Alligator&quot;. Hiaasen graduated in 1974 with a degree in journalism.

==Journalism==
Hiaasen was a reporter at &quot;TODAY&quot; (Cocoa, Florida) for two years before being hired in 1976 by the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, where he worked for the city desk, Sunday magazine and award-winning investigative team. Hiaasen was a columnist for the newspaper from mid-1985 until he retired in March 2021. His columns have been collected in three published volumes, &quot;Kick Ass&quot; (1999&quot;), Paradise Screwed&quot; (2001) and &quot;Dance of the Reptiles&quot; (2014), all edited by Diane Stevenson.

His only brother was Rob Hiaasen, an editor and columnist at &quot;The Capital&quot; newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, who was killed in the mass shooting at the newspaper&#x27;s office on June 28, 2018. Carl Hiaasen&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;Native Tongue&quot; carries the dedication &quot;For my brother Rob.&quot;

== Novelist ==
After becoming a reporter, Hiaasen began writing novels in his spare time. The first three were co-authored with his friend and fellow journalist William Montalbano: &quot;Powder Burn&quot; (1981), &quot;Trap Line&quot; (1982), and &quot;A Death in China&quot; (1984). His first solo novel, &quot;Tourist Season&quot; (1986), featured a group of ragged eco-warriors who kidnap the Orange Bowl Queen in Miami. The book&#x27;s main character was whimsically memorialized by Jimmy Buffett in a song called &quot;The Ballad of Skip Wiley&quot;, which appeared on his &quot;Barometer Soup&quot; album.

Twenty-one of Hiaasen&#x27;s novels and nonfiction books have been on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller lists. His work has been translated into 34 languages. In 2016, his novel &quot;Razor Girl&quot; was shortlisted for the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize.

An earlier Hiaasen novel, &quot;Strip Tease,&quot; was adapted into the 1996 feature film &quot;Striptease&quot; starring Demi Moore and Burt Reynolds. Another book, &quot;Bad Monkey,&quot; has been adapted into a series on Apple TV. It stars Vince Vaughn and is written and executive produced by Bill Lawrence, who co-created &quot;Ted Lasso&quot;. The series began airing in August 2024. 

Hiaasen&#x27;s first venture into writing for younger readers was the 2002 novel &quot;Hoot&quot;, which was named a Newbery Medal honor book. It was adapted as a 2006 film of the same name (starring Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Luke Wilson). The movie was written and directed by Wil Shriner. Jimmy Buffett provided songs for the soundtrack, and appeared in the role of Mr. Ryan, a middle school teacher.

Hiaasen&#x27;s subsequent children&#x27;s novels are &quot;Flush&quot;; &quot;Scat&quot;; &quot;Chomp&quot;; &quot;Skink - No Surrender&quot;, which introduces one of his most popular adult characters to younger readers; &quot;Squirm&quot;; and the latest, &quot;Wrecker&quot;. 

In 2014, &quot;Skink&quot; was longlisted for a National Book Award in Young People&#x27;s Literature. Hiaasen&#x27;s books for young readers feature environmental themes, eccentric casts and adventure-filled plots. &quot;Squirm,&quot; which is set in Florida and Montana, was published in fall 2018 and opened at #4 on the New York Times bestseller list for middle-grade novels.

&quot;Wrecker,&quot; released on September 26, 2023, is set in Key West during the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called it, &quot;A batten-down-the-hatches thriller anchored by critical real-life themes&quot;. &quot;Booklist&quot; wrote, &quot;Wielding his writing talents and wit, Hiaasen seamlessly incorporates...disparate elements into one heck of a ride&quot;. &quot;Wrecker&quot; debuted at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Children&#x27;s Middle Grade Hardcover Best Sellers List.

His adult book, &quot;Squeeze Me,&quot; was published on August 25, 2020, and debuted at #2 on the New York Times Combined Print and E-Book Print Best Sellers List. The novel takes place during the glitzy Palm Beach social season, and features wild pythons and a fictional, well-fed U.S. president who has a vacation mansion on the island. Amazon and the &quot;Washington&quot; &quot;Post&quot; listed &quot;Squeeze Me&quot; among the best novels of 2020.

&quot;Fever Beach&quot;, publishing on May 13, 2025, features the character Twilly Spree, who was introduced in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Sick Puppy.&quot;

Hiaasen&#x27;s most recent nonfiction work is &quot;Assume the Worst: The Graduation Speech You&#x27;ll Never Hear&quot;, which was published in April 2018 and illustrated by Roz Chast, known for her cartoons in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

== Songwriting ==
During the 1990s, Hiaasen co-wrote the lyrics of three songs with his friend, L.A. rocker Warren Zevon. &quot;Rottweiler Blues&quot; and &quot;Seminole Bingo&quot; appeared on Zevon&#x27;s &quot;Mutineer&quot; album in 1995. The third song they wrote together, &quot;Basket Case,&quot; was done in conjunction with Hiaasen&#x27;s novel of the same name, and appeared in 2002 on Zevon&#x27;s album &quot;My Ride&#x27;s Here.&quot;

Hiaasen co-wrote &quot;Fish Porn&quot; on Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s final album, &quot;Equal Strain on All Parts&quot;, with Buffett and Mac McAnally.

== Personal life ==

Hiaasen is a fly fisherman who has won the Invitational Fall Fly Bonefish Tournament in Islamorada six times, fishing with guide Tim Klein.
His wife is Katie Fox, whom he married in 2020.

<text>A sauna (, ) is a room or building designed as a place to experience dry or wet heat sessions or an establishment with one or more of these facilities. The steam and high heat make the bathers perspire. A thermometer in a sauna is used to measure temperature; a hygrometer can be used to measure levels of humidity or steam. Infrared therapy is often referred to as a type of sauna, but according to the Finnish sauna organizations, infrared is not a sauna.

==History==
Areas such as the rocky Orkney islands of Scotland have many ancient stone structures for normal habitation, some of which incorporate areas for fire and bathing. It is possible some of these structures also incorporated the use of steam in a way similar to the sauna, but this is a matter of speculation. The sites are from the Neolithic age, dating to approximately 4000 B.C.E. Archaeological sites in Greenland and Newfoundland have uncovered structures very similar to traditional Scandinavian farm saunas, some with bathing platforms and &quot;enormous quantities of badly scorched stones&quot;.

The traditional Korean sauna, called the &quot;hanjeungmak&quot;, is a domed structure constructed of stone that was first mentioned in the &quot;Sejong Sillok&quot; of the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty in the 15th century. Supported by Sejong the Great, the &quot;hanjeungmak&quot; was touted for its health benefits and used to treat illnesses. In the early 15th century, Buddhist monks maintained &quot;hanjeungmak&quot; clinics, called &quot;hanjeungso&quot;, to treat sick poor people; these clinics maintained separate facilities for men and women due to high demand. Korean sauna culture and kiln saunas are still popular today, and Korean saunas are ubiquitous.

Western saunas originated in Finland where the oldest known saunas were made from pits dug in a slope in the ground and primarily used as dwellings in winter. The sauna featured a fireplace where stones were heated to a high temperature. Water was thrown on the hot stones to produce steam and to give a sensation of increased heat. This would raise the apparent temperature so high that people could take off their clothes. The first Finnish saunas were always of a type now called &quot;savusauna&quot;; &quot;smoke sauna&quot;. These differed from present-day saunas in that they were operated by heating a pile of rocks called a &quot;kiuas&quot; by burning large amounts of wood for about 6 to 8 hours and then letting out the smoke before enjoying the &quot;löyly&quot;, a Finnish term meaning, collectively, both the steam and the heat of a sauna (same term in Estonian is &quot;leili&quot; - you can see similarities with Finnish word). A properly heated &quot;savusauna&quot; yields heat for up to 12 hours.

As a result of the Industrial Revolution, the sauna evolved to use a wood-burning metal stove with rocks on top, &quot;kiuas&quot;, with a chimney. Air temperatures averaged around but sometimes exceeded in a traditional Finnish sauna. As the Finns migrated to other areas of the globe, they brought their sauna designs and traditions with them. This led to a further evolution of the sauna, including the electric sauna stove, which was introduced in 1938 by Metos Ltd in Vaasa. Although sauna culture is more or less related to Finnish and Estonian culture, the evolution of the sauna took place around the same time in Finland and Baltic countries; they all have valued the sauna, its customs and traditions until the present day.

The sauna became very popular especially in Scandinavia and the German-speaking regions of Europe after the Second World War. German soldiers had experienced Finnish saunas during their fight against the Soviet Union during the Continuation War, where they fought on the same side. Saunas were so important to Finnish soldiers that they built them not only in mobile tents but even in bunkers. After the war, the German soldiers brought the custom back to Germany and Austria, where it became popular in the second half of the 20th century. The German sauna culture also became popular in neighbouring countries such as Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.

Sauna culture has been registered in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity under two entries: &quot;Smoke sauna tradition in Võromaa&quot; in 2014 and &quot;Sauna culture in Finland&quot; in 2020.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;&quot; is an ancient Finnish word referring to both the traditional Finnish bath and to the bathhouse itself. In Finnic languages other than Finnish and Estonian, &quot;sauna&quot; and cognates do not necessarily mean a building or space built for bathing. It can also mean a small cabin or cottage, such as a cabin for a fisherman. The word is the best known Finnicism in many languages.

==Modern saunas==

The sauna known in the Western world today originates from Northern Europe. In Finland, there are built-in saunas in almost every house, including communal saunas in the older apartment buildings; since the 80s, private saunas have often been built into the bathrooms of typical Finnish flats in apartment buildings, sometimes even in student housing. There are also many public saunas in Finland, including Rajaportin Sauna, a sauna located in Tampere, that was first established in 1906 by Hermanni and Maria Lahtinen. Helsinki even has a sauna built into one of the gondolas of a Ferris wheel, SkyWheel Helsinki. Unlike many other countries, Finnish people usually prefer to be naked instead of wearing a swimsuit, towel, or other kind of clothing.

Under many circumstances, temperatures approaching and exceeding would be completely intolerable and possibly fatal to a person exposed to them for long periods. Saunas overcome this problem by controlling the humidity. The hottest Finnish saunas have relatively low humidity levels in which steam is generated by pouring water on the hot stones. This allows air temperatures that could evaporate water to be tolerated and even enjoyed for longer periods. Steam baths, such as the hammam, where the humidity approaches 100%, will be set to a much lower temperature of around to compensate. The &quot;wet heat&quot; would cause scalding if the temperature were set much higher.

In a typical Finnish sauna, the temperature of the air, the room, and the benches are above the dew point even when water is thrown on the hot stones and vaporized. Thus, they remain dry. In contrast, the sauna bathers are at about , which is below the dew point, so that water is condensed on the bathers&#x27; skin. This process releases heat and makes the steam feel hot.

Finer control over the perceived temperature can be achieved by choosing a higher-level bench for those wishing for a hotter experience, or a lower-level bench for a more moderate temperature. A good sauna has a relatively small temperature gradient between the various seating levels. Doors need to be kept closed and used quickly to maintain the temperature and to keep the steam inside.

Some North American, Western European, Japanese, Russian, and South African public sport center and gyms include sauna facilities. They may also be present at public and private swimming pools. As an additional facility, a sauna may have one or more jacuzzi. In some spa centers, there are the so-called special &quot;snow rooms,&quot; also known as cold saunas or cryotherapy. Operating at a temperature of , the user is in the sauna for only about three minutes.

According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the world&#x27;s largest sauna is the Koi Sauna in the Thermen &amp; Badewelt Sinsheim, Germany. It measures 166 square meters, holds 150 people, and sports a koi aquarium. The title may now belong to Cape East Spa in Haparanda, Sweden, which also holds 150 people but is more spacious.
However, in Czeladz, south Poland, there is now a sauna for 300 people, sporting light shows, theatre, and several sauna masters.

==Use==
A modern sauna with an electric stove usually takes about 15–30 minutes to heat up. Some users prefer taking a shower beforehand to speed up perspiration in the sauna. When in the sauna, people often sit on a towel for hygiene and put a towel over their heads if the face feels too hot but the body feels comfortable. In Russia, a felt &quot;banya hat&quot; may be worn to shield the head from the heat; this allows the wearer to increase the heat on the rest of the body. The temperature of one&#x27;s bath can be controlled via:
* the amount of water thrown on the stove: this increases humidity so that sauna bathers perspire more copiously
* the length of one&#x27;s stay in the sauna
* positioning: the higher benches are hotter, whereas the lower benches are cooler. Children often sit on the lower benches.

The heat is greatest closest to the stove. Heating from the air is lower on the lower benches as the hot air rises. The heat given by the steam can be very different in different parts of the sauna. As the steam rises directly upwards, it spreads across the roof and travels out towards the corners, where it is then forced downwards. Consequently, the heat of fresh steam may sometimes be felt most strongly in the furthest corners of the sauna. Users increase the duration and the heat gradually over time as they adapt to the sauna. When pouring water onto the stove, it cools down the rocks, but carries more heat into the air via advection, making the sauna warmer.

Perspiration is the result of autonomic responses trying to cool the body. Users are advised to leave the sauna if the heat becomes unbearable, or if they feel faint or ill. Some saunas have a thermostat to adjust the temperature, but the owner of the sauna and the other bathers expect to be consulted before changes are made. The sauna stove and rocks are very hot—one must stay well clear of them to avoid burns, particularly when water is thrown on the rocks, which creates an immediate blast of steam. Combustibles on, or near the stove have been known to cause fires. Contact lenses dry out in the heat. Jewelry or anything metallic, including glasses, will get hot in the sauna and can cause discomfort or burning.

The temperature on different parts of the body can be adjusted by shielding one&#x27;s body with a towel. Shielding the face with a towel has been found to reduce the perception of heat. Some may wish to put an additional towel or a special cap over the head to avoid dryness. Few people can sit directly in front of the stove without feeling too hot from the radiant heat, but this may not be reflected in their overall body temperature. As the person&#x27;s body is often the coolest object in a sauna room, steam will condense into water on the skin; this can be confused with perspiration.

Cooling down by immersing oneself in water (in a shower, lake, or pool) is a part of the sauna cycle and is as important as the heating. However, healthy people and heart patients alike should take some precautions if plunging into very cold water straight after coming from the hot room, as the rapid cooling of the body produces considerable circulatory stress. It is considered good practice to take a few moments after exiting a sauna before entering a cold plunge and to enter a plunge pool or a lake by stepping into it gradually, rather than immediately immersing oneself fully. In summer, a session is often started with a cool shower.

In some countries, the closest and most convenient access to a sauna is at a gymnasium. Some public pools, major sports centers, and resorts also contain a sauna. Therapeutic sauna sessions are often carried out in conjunction with physiotherapy or hydrotherapy; these are gentle exercises that do not exacerbate symptoms.

===Health effects===

==== Potential health benefits ====
There has been widespread research into the health benefits and risks that come from sauna usage; most studies have focused on the Finnish sauna specifically. Sauna bathing leads to mild heat stress, which activates heat shock proteins responsible for repairing misfolded proteins, promoting longevity as well as protection against muscle atrophy and chronic illness.

There is evidence that long-term exposure to Finnish-style sauna is correlated with a reduced risk of sudden cardiac death; and that risk reduction increases with duration and frequency of use; this reduction is more pronounced when sauna bathing is combined with exercise, compared with either of these practices alone. Tentative evidence supports that the heat stress from saunas is associated with reduced blood pressure and arterial stiffness, and therefore also decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. These benefits are more pronounced in persons with low cardiovascular function. Evidence exists for the benefit of sauna on people with heart failure. Frequent Finnish-style sauna usage (4-7 times per week) is associated with a decreased risk of neurovascular diseases, including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and stroke, relative to those individuals who used sauna once per week. Individuals suffering from musculoskeletal disorders could have symptomatic improvement from sauna, and it could be beneficial for glaucoma. It also is associated with a reduced risk and symptom relief from the symptoms of respiratory illness. Weight loss in obese people and improvement of appetite loss present with normal body weight can also be achievable with sauna bathing.

Evidence for the use of sauna for depression or skin disorders is insufficient, but the frequency of sauna sessions is correlated with a diminished risk of developing psychosis, and it might be beneficial for psoriasis.

====Potential health risks====
Sauna bathing coupled with alcohol consumption or dehydration increases the risk of sudden death; the use of narcotic drugs, such as cocaine, also increases the risk. Being severely obese, having high blood pressure, or being diabetic all serve as reasons to decrease the duration of sauna sessions. Individuals prone to postural hypotension or severe valvular heart disease should use a sauna cautiously to reduce the risk of a drop in blood pressure. In people with cardiovascular disease, sauna usage is generally safe, as long as their condition is stable. However, sauna bathing is contraindicated in persons with unstable angina and severe aortic stenosis. A one-year study in Finland showed that only 67 (2.6%) of sudden deaths in saunas were non-accidental, mostly due to coronary heart disease.

Pregnant women can use saunas as long as their core temperature does not exceed , as this may be teratogenic.

One study has found that genital heat stress from frequent sauna sessions could cause male infertility.

==Technologies==
Today there is a wide variety of sauna options. Heat sources include wood, electricity, gas, and other unconventional methods such as solar power. There are wet saunas, dry saunas, infrared saunas, smoke saunas, and steam saunas. There are two main types of stoves: continuous heating and heat storage type. Continuously heating stoves have a small heat capacity and can be heated up on a fast on-demand basis, whereas a heat storage stove has a large heat (stone) capacity and can take much longer to heat.

===Heat storage-type===
====Smoke sauna====
Smoke sauna (Finnish &quot;savusauna&quot;, Estonian &quot;suitsusaun&quot;, Võro &quot;savvusann&quot;) is one of the earliest forms of the sauna. It is simply a room containing a pile of rocks but without a chimney. A fire is lit directly under the rocks and after a while, the fire is extinguished. The heat is retained in the rocks, and the earlier fire becomes the main source for heating the sauna. Following this process, the ashes and embers are removed from the hearth, the benches and floor are cleaned, and the room is allowed to air out and freshen for some time. The smoke deposits a layer of soot on every surface, so if the benches and back-rests can be removed while the fire is alight the amount of cleaning necessary is reduced. Depending on the size of the stove and the airing time, the temperature may be low, about , while the humidity is relatively high. The tradition almost died out in Finland but was revived by enthusiasts in the 1980s. These are still used in present-day Finland by some enthusiasts, but usually only on special occasions such as Christmas, New Year&#x27;s, Easter, and &quot;juhannus&quot; (Midsummer). Smoke saunas are popular in the southern Estonia and smoke sauna tradition in Võrumaa was added into UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2014.

====Heat storage-sauna====
The smoke-sauna stove is also used with a sealed stone compartment and chimney (a heat storage stove) which eliminates the smoke odor and eye irritation of the smoke sauna. A heat storage stove does not give up much heat in the sauna before bathing since the stone compartment has an insulated lid. When the sauna bath is started and the &quot;löyly&quot; shutter opens a soft warmth flows into the otherwise relatively cold () sauna. This heat is soft and clean because, thanks to combustion, the stove stones glow red, even white-hot, and are free of dust at the same time. When bathing the heat-storage sauna will become as hot as a continuous fire-type sauna () but more humid. The stones are usually durable heatproof and heat-retaining peridotite. The upper part of the stove is often insulated with rock wool and firebricks. Heat-storing stoves are also found with electric heating, with similar service but no need to maintain a fire.

===Continuous heat-type===
====Continuous fire sauna====
A continuous fire stove, instead of stored heat, is a relatively recent invention. There is a firebox and a smokestack, and stones are placed in a compartment directly above the firebox. It takes a shorter time to heat than the heat-storage sauna, about one hour. A fire-heated sauna requires manual labor in the form of maintaining the fire during bathing; the fire can also be seen as a hazard.

Fire-heated saunas are common in cottages, where the extra work of maintaining the fire is not a problem.

==== Electric stove sauna ====
The most common modern sauna types are those with electric stoves. The stones are heated up and kept on temperature using electric heating elements. There is a thermostat and a timer (typically with eight hours&#x27; maximum delay time, followed by one hour&#x27;s continuous heating time) on the stove. This type of heating is generally used only in urban saunas.

==== Far-infrared saunas ==== 
Far-infrared saunas utilize infrared light to generate heat. Unlike traditional saunas that heat the body indirectly through the air or by conduction from heated surfaces, far-infrared saunas use infrared panels or other methods like a sauna blanket that emit far-infrared light, which is absorbed by the surface of the skin. The heat produced by far-infrared saunas is generally lower, making it more tolerable for people who cannot withstand the high temperatures of traditional saunas. Infrared heat penetrates more deeply into fat and the neuromuscular system resulting in a more vigorous sweat at lower temperature than traditional saunas. These effects are favorable for the neuromuscular system to recover from maximal endurance exercise.

==Other sweat bathing facilities==

Many cultures have sweat baths, though some have more spiritual uses while others are purely secular. In Ancient Rome there was the &quot;thermae&quot; or &quot;balneae&quot; (from Greek βαλανεῖον &quot;balaneîon&quot;), traits of which survive in the Turkish or Arab &quot;hammam&quot; and in the Victorian Turkish bath (which uses only hot dry air). In the Americas there is the Nahuatl (Aztec) &quot;temāzcalli&quot; , Maya &quot;zumpul-ché&quot;, and the Mixtec &quot;Ñihi&quot;; in Canada and the United States, a number of First Nations and Native American cultures have various kinds of spiritual sweat lodges (Lakota: &quot;inipi&quot;, Anishinaabemowin &quot;madoodiswan&quot;). In Europe we find the Estonian &quot;saun&quot; (almost identical to the Finnish sauna), Russian &quot;banya&quot;, Latvian &quot;pirts&quot;, the European Jews&#x27; &quot;shvitz&quot;, and the Swedish &quot;bastu&quot;. In Asia the Japanese &quot;Mushi-Buro&quot; and the Korean &quot;jjimjilbang&quot;. The Karo people of Indonesia have the &quot;oukup&quot;. In some parts of Africa, there is the &quot;sifutu&quot;.

Although cultures in all corners of the world have imported and adapted the sauna, many of the traditional customs have not survived the journey. Today, public perception of saunas, sauna &quot;etiquette&quot; and sauna customs vary hugely from country to country. In many countries sauna going is a recent fashion and attitudes towards saunas are changing, while in others traditions have survived over generations.

===Africa===
In Africa, most sauna facilities are found in more upmarket hotels, spas, and health clubs and predominantly share both sauna heater technology and design concepts as applied in Europe. Even though outdoor temperatures remain warmer and more humid, this does not affect the general application or intended sauna experience offered within these commercial environments offering a traditional sauna and or steam shower experience.

===Asia===
In Iran, most gyms, hotels, and almost all public swimming pools have indoor saunas. It is very common for swimming pools to have two saunas which are known in Persian as سونای خشک &quot;dry sauna&quot; and سونای بخار &quot;steam sauna&quot;, with the dry type customarily boasting a higher temperature. A cold-water pool (and/or more recently a cold Jacuzzi) is almost always accompanied and towels are usually provided. Adding therapeutic or relaxing essential oils to the rocks is common. In Iran, unlike Finland, sitting in a sauna is mostly seen as part of the spa/club culture, rather than a bathing ritual. It is most usually perceived as a means for relaxation or detoxification (through perspiration). Having a sauna room on private property is considered a luxury rather than a necessity. Public saunas are segregated and nudity is prohibited.

In Japan, many saunas exist at sports centers and public bathhouses (sentō). The saunas are almost always gender separated, often required by law, and nudity is a required part of proper sauna etiquette. While right after World War II, public bathhouses were commonplace in Japan, the number of customers dwindled as more people were able to afford houses and apartments equipped with their own private baths as the nation became wealthier. As a result, many sentōs have added more features such as saunas to survive.

In Korea, saunas are essentially public bathhouses. Various names are used to describe them, such as the smaller mogyoktang, outdoor oncheon, and the elaborate jjimjilbang. The word &quot;sauna&quot; is used a lot for its &#x27;English appeal&#x27;; however, it does not strictly refer to the original Fennoscandian steam rooms that have become popular throughout the world. The konglish word &quot;sauna&quot; (사우나) usually refers to bathhouses with Jacuzzis, hot tubs, showers, steam rooms, and related facilities.In Laos, herbal steam sauna or &quot;hom yaa&quot; in Lao, is very popular, especially with women and is available in every village. Many women apply yogurt or a paste blend based on tamarind on their skin as a beauty treatment. The sauna is always heated by wood fire and herbs are added either directly to the boiling water or steam jet in the room. The sitting lounge is mixed gender but the steam rooms are gender separated. Bael fruit tea known in lao as &quot;muktam&quot; tea is usually served.

===Australia and Canada===
In Australia and Canada, saunas are found mainly in hotels, swimming pools, and health clubs and if used by both men and women, nudity is often forbidden, even if implicitly. In gyms or health clubs with separate male and female change rooms, nudity is permitted; however, members are usually asked to shower before using the sauna and to sit on a towel.

In Canada, saunas have increasingly become a fixture of cottage culture, which shares many similarities with its Finnish counterpart (mökki).

===Europe===
====Nordic and Baltic====
=====Finland and Estonia=====
A sauna session can be a social affair in which the participants disrobe and sit or recline in temperatures typically between . This induces relaxation and promotes sweating. People use a bundle of birch twigs with fresh leaves (Finnish: &quot;vihta&quot; or &quot;vasta&quot;; Estonian: &quot;viht&quot;), to slap the skin and create further stimulation of the pores and cells.

The sauna is an important part of daily life, and families bathe together in the home sauna. There are at least 2 million saunas in Finland according to official registers. The Finnish Sauna Society believes the number can be as high as 3.2 million saunas (population 5.5 million). Many Finns take at least one a week, and much more when they visit their summer cottage in the countryside. Here the pattern of life tends to revolve around the sauna, and a nearby lake used for cooling off.

Sauna traditions in Estonia are almost identical to Finland as saunas have traditionally held a central role in the life of an individual. Ancient Estonians believed saunas were inhabited by spirits. In folk tradition, the sauna was not only the place where one washed but also used as the place where brides were ceremoniously washed, where women gave birth, and the place where the dying made their final bed. The folk tradition related to the Estonian sauna is mostly identical to that surrounding the Finnish sauna. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, a sauna would be held before midnight to cleanse the body and spirit for the upcoming year.

=====Latvia and Lithuania=====
In Lithuanian, bathhouse or sauna is ; in Latvian, it is . Both countries have long bathhouse traditions, dating back to the pagan times.

The 13th-century bathhouses in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were mentioned in the Hypatian Codex and Chronicon terrae Prussiae, as they were practised by the Lithuanian dukes. Livonian Chronicle of Henry describes a bathhouse built around 1196 near the pier on the bank of Daugava river. The chronicle also mentions the year 1215 baths of the Latgalian ruler Tālivaldis which were built in Trikāta. These baths are also mentioned in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle. Sauna had a considerable role in the pagan traditions of the Baltic people. In the 17th century, Matthäus Prätorius described various rituals the Baltic people practiced in the sauna. For example, sauna was a primary place for women to give birth and rites would be performed for the Baltic goddess Laima. At that time, sauna traditions were similar in Aukštaitija, Samogitia, Latgale, Semigallia as well as some West Slavic lands. In 1536, Vilnius gained a royal privilege to build public bathhouses, and by the end of the 16th century, the city already had 60 of them with a countless number of private ones. In Latvian lands, bathhouses became particularly popular in the 19th century.

The contemporary Baltic sauna is similar to others in the north-eastern part of Europe: it varies according to personal preference but is typically around , humidity 60–90%, with steam being generated by pouring water on the hot stones. Traditionally, birch twigs (; ) are the most common, but oak or linden are used too. Sauna enthusiasts also make twigs from other trees and plants, including nettle and juniper. Dry air sauna of and very low humidity became popular relatively recently; despite being a misconception, it is sometimes locally described as &quot;Finnish-type&quot;.

=====Norway and Sweden=====

In Norway and Sweden saunas are found in many places and are known as &#x27;badstu&#x27; or &#x27;bastu&#x27; (from &#x27;badstuga&#x27; &quot;bath cabin, bath house&quot;). In Norway and Sweden, saunas are common in almost every public swimming pool and gym. The public saunas are generally single-sex and may or may not permit the use of swimwear. Rules for swimwear and towels for sitting on or covering yourself differ between saunas. Removing body hair in the sauna, staring at other&#x27;s nudity, or spreading odors is considered impolite.

====Dutch-speaking regions====

Public saunas can be found throughout the Netherlands and Flanders, both in major cities and in smaller municipalities, mixed-sex nudity is the generally accepted rule. Some saunas might offer women-only (or &quot;bathing suit only&quot;) times for people who are less comfortable with mixed-sex nudity; &quot;Algemeen Dagblad&quot; reported in 2008 that women-only, bathing suit-required times are drawing Muslim women in the Netherlands to the sauna.

====United Kingdom, Atlantic and Mediterranean Europe====
In the United Kingdom and much of Southern Europe, single-gender saunas are the most common type. Nudity is expected in the segregated saunas but is usually forbidden in the mixed saunas. Sauna sessions tend to be shorter, and cold showers are shunned by most. In the United Kingdom, where public saunas are becoming increasingly fashionable, the practice of alternating between the sauna and the jacuzzi in short seatings (considered a &quot;faux pas&quot; in Northern Europe) has emerged.

There is a fast-growing new British sauna culture consisting mainly of &#x27;wild&#x27; outdoor spas, popping up all over the UK.

In Portugal, the steam baths were commonly used by the Castrejos people, before the arrival of the Romans in the western part of the Iberian Peninsula. The historian Strabo spoke of Lusitans traditions that consisted of having steam bath sessions followed by cold water baths. Pedra Formosa is the original name given to the central piece of the steam bath in pre-Roman times.

====German-speaking countries====
In Germany, Austria, Luxembourg South Tyrol and Lombardy, most public swimming pool complexes have sauna areas; in these locales, nudity is the generally accepted rule, and benches are expected to be covered by people&#x27;s towels. These rules are strictly enforced in some public saunas. Separate single-sex saunas for both genders are rare, most places offer women-only and mixed-gender saunas or organize women-only days for the sauna once a week. Loud conversation is not usual as the sauna is seen as a place of healing rather than socializing. Contrary to Russia and Nordic countries, pouring water on hot stones to increase humidity (&quot;Aufguss&quot;, lit: &quot;Onpouring&quot;) is not normally done by the sauna visitors themselves; larger sauna areas have a person in charge (the &quot;Saunameister&quot;) for that, either an employee of the sauna complex or a volunteer. Aufguss sessions can take up to 10 minutes, and take place according to a schedule. During an Aufguss session, the Saunameister uses a large towel to circulate the hot air through the sauna, intensifying sweating and the perception of heat. Once the Aufguss session has started it is not considered good manners to enter the sauna, as opening the door would cause loss of heat (Sauna guests are expected to enter the sauna just in time before the Aufguss. Leaving the session is allowed, and is advised when feeling too hot or otherwise uncomfortable). Aufguss sessions are usually announced by a schedule on the sauna door. An Aufguss session in progress might be indicated by a light or sign hung above the sauna entrance. Cold showers or baths shortly after a sauna, as well as exposure to fresh air in a special balcony, garden, or open-air room (&quot;Frischluftraum&quot;) are considered a must.

In German-speaking Switzerland, customs are generally the same as in Germany and Austria, although you tend to see more families (parents with their children) and young people. Also concerning socializing in the sauna, the Swiss tend more to be like the Finns, Scandinavians, or Russians. Also in German-speaking countries, there are many facilities for washing after using the sauna, with &#x27;dunking pools&#x27; (pools of very cold water in which a person dips themselves after using the sauna) or showers. In some saunas and steam rooms, scented salts are given out which can be rubbed into the skin for extra aroma and cleaning effects.

====Hungary====
Hungarians see the sauna as part of a wider spa culture. Most commonly, mixed genders use the sauna together and wear swimsuits. Single-sex saunas are rare, as well as those that impose nudity although the practice is growing and several spas have a towel-only policy on designated days. The most common types of saunas are the very hot and dry Finnish sauna (&quot;finn szauna&quot;), the steam room (&quot;gőzkabin&quot;), and the infrared sauna (&quot;infraszauna&quot;). In many larger spas, you can find a separate sauna section that can only be used with a separate entrance ticket. These units are often called sauna world (&quot;szaunavilág&quot;) and have additional services, for example, a cold plunge pool, resting areas, jacuzzi, showers, and crushed ice bucket. Aufguss sessions, led by a qualified sauna master, are becoming popular.

====Czech Republic and Slovakia====
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, saunas have a long tradition and are often found as part of recreational facilities, as well as public swimming pools. Many people are regular goers, while many never go. Saunas became more popular after about the year 2000 when large aquaparks and wellness centers began to include them. Nudity is increasingly tolerated, and many places prohibit the use of swimsuits; however, most people cover themselves with a towel. Showers are typically semi-private. Having men and women-only days was the norm in the past, but today, men-only facilities are rare, while women-only hours are sometimes provided.

====Russia====


In many regions of Russia, sauna-going plays a central social role. These countries also have the tradition of massaging fellow sauna-goers with leafy, wet birch bunches, called &quot;venik&quot; (веник) in Russian. In Russian-speaking communities, the word &quot;banya&quot; (Russian: Баня) is widely used also when referring to a public bath. In Russia, public &quot;banya&quot; baths are strictly single-sex. During wintertime, sauna-goers often run outdoors for either ice swimming or, in the absence of lake, just to roll around in the snow naked and then go back inside. Russian traditional &quot;banya&quot; is quite similar to the Finnish sauna, despite the popular misconception that the Finnish sauna is very dry.

In modern Russia, there are three different types of saunas. The first one, previously very popular especially during the 20th century, is the public sauna or the &quot;banya&quot;, (also known as the Russian banya), as it is referred to among the locals, is similar in context to public bathhouses in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. The banya is a large setting with many different rooms. There is at least one sauna (Finnish style), one cold pool of water, a relaxation area, another sauna where fellow sauna goers beat other fellow sauna goers with the leafy birch, a shower area, a small cafeteria with a TV and drinks, and a large common area that leads to the other areas. In this large area, there are marble bed-like structures where people lie down and receive a massage either by another sauna member or by a designated masseur. In the resting area, there are also other bed-like structures made of marble or stone attached to the ground where people lie down to rest between different rounds of sauna or at the very end of their banya session. There is also a large public locker area where one keeps one&#x27;s clothes as well as two other private locker areas with individual doors that can lock these two separate locker rooms.

The second type of sauna is the Finnish sauna type one can find in any gym throughout the world or a hotel. It could be in the locker room or mixed (i. e. male and female together). Attitudes towards nudity are very liberal and people are less self-conscious about their nude bodies.

The third type of sauna is rented by a group of friends. It is similar to the public banya bath house type, except that it is usually more modern and luxurious, and is often rented by groups of friends by the hour for the use of partying and socialising. Here it can be single-sex or mixed-sex.

===North America and Central America===
In the United States, the earliest saunas that arrived with the colonists were Swedish &quot;bastu&quot;s in the colony of New Sweden around the Delaware River. The Swedish governor at the time had a bathhouse on Tinicum Island. Today sauna culture enjoys its greatest popularity in the Lake Superior Region, specifically the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, especially the Keweenaw Peninsula, and parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, which are home to large populations of Swedish and particularly Finnish Americans. Duluth, Minnesota, at its peak, had as many as 14 public saunas. Indeed, among Finnish farms in Great Lakes &quot;sauna country&quot;, the cultural geographer Matti Kaups, found that 90% had sauna structures - more even than the farms in Finland. Elsewhere, sauna facilities are normally provided at health clubs and hotels, but there is no tradition or ritual to their use. To avoid liability, many saunas operate at only moderate temperatures and do not allow pouring water on the rocks. A wider range of sauna etiquette is usually acceptable in the United States compared to other countries, with the exception that most mixed-sex saunas usually require some clothing such as a bathing suit to be worn. These are uncommon, however, as most saunas are either in small private rooms or in the changing rooms of health clubs or gyms. There are few restrictions and their use is casual; bathers may enter and exit the sauna as they please, be it nude, with a towel, dripping wet in swimsuits, or even in workout clothes (the latter being very unusual). Like many aspects of US culture, there are few prescribed conventions and the bather should remain astute to &quot;read&quot; the specific family or community&#x27;s expectations. Besides the Finnish Americans, the older generation of Korean Americans still uses the saunas as it is available to them. Sauna societies are beginning to emerge in colleges across America, with the first one being formed at Gustavus Adolphus College.

A cultural legacy of Eastern European Jews in America is the culture of &#x27;shvitz&#x27;, which used to be widespread on the East Coast and occasionally on the Pacific West Coast.

The sweat lodge, used by several Native American and First Nations traditional ceremonial cultures, is a location for a spiritual ceremony. The focus is on the ceremony, and the sweating is only secondary. Unlike sauna traditions, and most forcefully in the case of the Inipi, the sweat lodge ceremonies have been robustly defended as an exclusively Native expression of spirituality rather than a recreational activity.

==Traditions and old beliefs==
The Finnish word &quot;löyly&quot; is strictly connected to the sauna. It can be translated as &quot;sauna steam&quot; and refers to the steam vapour created by splashing water on the heated rocks. In many languages related to Finnish, there is a word corresponding to &quot;löyly&quot;. The same approximate meaning is used across the Finnic languages such as in Estonian &quot;leil&quot;. Originally this word meant &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;life&quot;, as in e. g. Hungarian &quot;&quot; and Khanty &quot;lil&quot;, which both mean &quot;soul&quot;, referring to the sauna&#x27;s old, spiritual essence. The same dual meaning of both &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;(sauna) steam&quot; is also preserved in the Latvian word &quot;gars&quot;. There is an old Finnish saying, &quot;saunassa ollaan kuin kirkossa&quot;,—one should behave in the sauna as in church.

&quot;Saunatonttu&quot;, literally translated as &quot;sauna elf&quot;, is a little gnome or tutelary spirit that was believed to live in the sauna. He was always treated with respect, otherwise, he might have caused much trouble for people. It was customary to warm up the sauna just for the &quot;tonttu&quot; every now and then, or to leave some food outside for him. It is said that he warned the people if a fire was threatening the sauna or punished people who behaved improperly in it—for example, slept, played games, argued, were generally noisy, or behaved otherwise immorally there. Such creatures are believed to exist in different cultures. The Russian banya has an entirely corresponding character called a &quot;bannik&quot;.

In Thailand, women spend hours in a makeshift sauna tent during the month following childbirth. The steam is typically infused with several herbs. It is believed that the sauna helps the new mother&#x27;s body return to its normal condition more quickly.

<text>The word lituus originally meant a curved augural staff, or a curved war-trumpet in the ancient Latin language. This Latin word continued in use through the 18th century as an alternative to the vernacular names of various musical instruments.

==Roman ritual wand==
The &quot;lituus&quot; was a crooked wand (similar in shape to the top part of some Western European crosiers) used as a cult instrument in ancient Roman religion by augurs to mark out a ritual space in the sky (a &quot;templum&quot;). The passage of birds through this &quot;templum&quot; indicated divine favor or disfavor for a given undertaking.

The &quot;lituus&quot; was also used as a symbol of office for the college of the augurs to mark them out as a priestly group.

==Music instrument==
===Antiquity===
The ancient &quot;lituus&quot; was an Etruscan high-pitched brass instrument, which was straight but bent at the end, in the shape of a letter J, similar to the Gallic carnyx. It was later used by the Romans, especially for processional music and as a signalling horn in the army. For the Roman military it may have been particular to the cavalry, and both the Etruscan and Roman versions were always used in pairs, like the prehistoric lurer. Unlike the Roman &quot;litui&quot;, the Etruscan instruments had detachable mouthpieces and in general appear to have been longer. The name &quot;lituus&quot; is Latin, thought to have been derived from an Etruscan cultic word describing a soothsayer&#x27;s wand modelled on a shepherd&#x27;s crook and associated with sacrifice and favourable omens. Earlier Roman and Etruscan depictions show the instrument used in processions, especially funeral processions. Players of the lituus were called &quot;liticines&quot;, though the name of the instrument appears to have been loosely used (by poets, not likely by soldiers) to describe other military brass instruments, such as the &quot;tuba&quot; or the &quot;buccina&quot;. In 17th-century Germany a variant of the bent ancient &quot;lituus&quot; was still used as a signalling horn by nightwatchmen.

===Medieval period===

From the end of the 10th through the 13th centuries, chroniclers of the Crusades used the word &quot;lituus&quot; vaguely—along with the Classical Latin names for other Roman military Trumpets and horns, such as the &quot;tuba&quot;, &quot;cornu&quot;, and &quot;buccina&quot; and the more up-to-date French term &quot;trompe&quot;—to describe various instruments employed in the Christian armies. However, it is impossible to determine just what sort of instrument might have been meant, and it is unlikely their litui were the same as the Etrusco-Roman instrument.

In the early 15th century, Jean de Gerson listed the lituus among those string instruments that were sounded by beating or striking, either with the fingernails, a plectrum, or a stick. Other instruments Gerson names in this category are the &quot;cythara&quot;, &quot;guiterna&quot;, &quot;psalterium&quot;, &quot;timpanum&quot;, and &quot;campanula&quot;.

===Modern era===
Throughout the postclassical era the name &quot;lituus&quot; continued to be used when discussing ancient and Biblical instruments, but with reference to contemporary musical practice in the Renaissance it usually referred to &quot;bent horns&quot; made of wood, particularly the crumhorn and the cornett. The crumhorn was especially associated with the lituus because of the similarity of its shape. The equation of the crumhorn with the lituus was especially strong among German writers. A 1585 English translation of Hadrianus Junius&#x27;s &quot;Nomenclator&quot; defines &quot;lituus&quot; as &quot;a writhen or crooked trumpet winding in and out; a shaulme&quot; (i.e., shawm), but a polyglot edition of the same book published in 1606 demonstrates how differently the term might have been understood in various languages at that time: German &quot;Schalmey&quot;, &quot;Krumme Trommeten&quot;, &quot;Krumhorn&quot;; Dutch &quot;Schalmeye&quot;; French &quot;Claron, ou cleron&quot;; Italian &quot;Trombetta bastarda&quot;; Spanish &quot;Trompeta curua, ò bastarda&quot;. The early Baroque composer and author Michael Praetorius used the word as a Latin equivalent of the German &quot;Schallmeye&quot; (shawm) or for the &quot;Krumbhoerner&quot; (crumhorns)—in the latter case also offering the Italian translations &quot;storti&quot;, and &quot;cornamuti torti&quot;.

A more particular term, &quot;lituus alpinus&quot;, was used in 1555 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner when he published the earliest detailed description of the Alphorn: &quot;nearly eleven feet long, made from two pieces of wood slightly curved and hollowed out, fitted together and skillfully bound with osiers&quot;.

A study made of Swedish dictionaries found that during the seventeenth century &quot;lituus&quot; was variously translated as &quot;sinka&quot; (= German &quot;Zink&quot;, cornett), &quot;krumhorn&quot;, &quot;krum trumeta&quot; (curved trumpet), &quot;claret&quot;, or &quot;horn&quot;.

In the eighteenth century the word once again came to describe contemporary brass instruments, such as in a 1706 inventory from the Ossegg monastery in Bohemia, which equates it with the hunting horn: &quot;litui vulgo Waldhörner duo ex tono G&quot;. Nevertheless, in 1732 Johann Gottfried Walther referred back to Renaissance and Medieval definitions, defining &quot;lituus&quot; as &quot;a cornett, formerly it also signified a shawm or, in Italian &quot;tubam curvam&quot;, a HeerHorn&quot;. (&quot;Heerhorn&quot; or &quot;Herhorn&quot; was a Middle High German name for a metal, slightly curved military signal horn, approximately five feet long, played with the bell turned upward.) In 1738, the well-known horn player Anton Joseph Hampel served as a godfather at the baptism of a daughter of the renowned Dresden lutenist Silvius Leopold Weiss. In the baptismal register he was described as &quot;Lituista Regius&quot;—&quot;royal lituus player&quot;. In the second half of the 18th century the lituus was described in one source as a Latin name for the trumpet or horn.

A number of musical compositions from the Baroque era specify an instrument by the Latin name &quot;lituus&quot;, including Bach&#x27;s motet &quot;O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht&quot; (BWV 118), a partita attributed to Jan Josef Ignác Brentner, as well as several masses and concertos by Johann Valentin Rathgeber. Scientists from Edinburgh University tried to recreate the lituus used by Bach in May 2009, in the form of a long wooden trumpet, assuming the word did not refer to a modern horn but to an instrument that had been out of use for 300 years.

<text>Hyperthermia, also known simply as overheating, is a condition in which an individual&#x27;s body temperature is elevated beyond normal due to failed thermoregulation. The person&#x27;s body produces or absorbs more heat than it dissipates. When extreme temperature elevation occurs, it becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death. Almost half a million deaths are recorded every year from hyperthermia.
The most common causes include heat stroke and adverse reactions to drugs. Heat stroke is an acute temperature elevation caused by exposure to excessive heat, or combination of heat and humidity, that overwhelms the heat-regulating mechanisms of the body. The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs, particularly those that affect the central nervous system. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare complication of some types of general anesthesia. Hyperthermia can also be caused by a traumatic brain injury.

Hyperthermia differs from fever in that the body&#x27;s temperature set point remains unchanged. The opposite is hypothermia, which occurs when the temperature drops below that required to maintain normal metabolism. The term is from Greek ὑπέρ, &quot;hyper&quot;, meaning &quot;above&quot;, and θέρμος, &quot;thermos&quot;, meaning &quot;heat&quot;.

==Classification==

In humans, hyperthermia is defined as a temperature greater than , depending on the reference used, that occurs without a change in the body&#x27;s temperature set point.

The normal human body temperature can be as high as in the late afternoon. Hyperthermia requires an elevation from the temperature that would otherwise be expected. Such elevations range from mild to extreme; body temperatures above can be life-threatening.

==Signs and symptoms==
An early stage of hyperthermia can be &quot;heat exhaustion&quot; (or &quot;heat prostration&quot; or &quot;heat stress&quot;), whose symptoms can include heavy sweating, rapid breathing and a fast, weak pulse. If the condition progresses to heat stroke, then hot, dry skin is typical as blood vessels dilate in an attempt to increase heat loss. An inability to cool the body through perspiration may cause dry skin. Hyperthermia from neurological disease may include little or no sweating, cardiovascular problems, and confusion or delirium.

Other signs and symptoms vary. Accompanying dehydration can produce nausea, vomiting, headaches, and low blood pressure and the latter can lead to fainting or dizziness, especially if the standing position is assumed quickly.

In severe heat stroke, confusion and aggressive behavior may be observed. Heart rate and respiration rate will increase (tachycardia and tachypnea) as blood pressure drops and the heart attempts to maintain adequate circulation. The decrease in blood pressure can then cause blood vessels to contract reflexively, resulting in a pale or bluish skin color in advanced cases. Young children, in particular, may have seizures. Eventually, organ failure, unconsciousness and death will result.

==Causes==
Heat stroke occurs when thermoregulation is overwhelmed by a combination of excessive metabolic production of heat (exertion), excessive environmental heat, and insufficient or impaired heat loss, resulting in an abnormally high body temperature. In severe cases, temperatures can exceed . Heat stroke may be &quot;non-exertional&quot; (classic) or &quot;exertional&quot;.

===Exertional===
Significant physical exertion in hot conditions can generate heat beyond the ability to cool, because, in addition to the heat, humidity of the environment may reduce the efficiency of the body&#x27;s normal cooling mechanisms. Human heat-loss mechanisms are limited primarily to sweating (which dissipates heat by evaporation, assuming sufficiently low humidity) and vasodilation of skin vessels (which dissipates heat by convection proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings, according to Newton&#x27;s law of cooling). Other factors, such as insufficient water intake, consuming alcohol, or lack of air conditioning, can worsen the problem.

The increase in body temperature that results from a breakdown in thermoregulation affects the body biochemically. Enzymes involved in metabolic pathways within the body such as cellular respiration fail to work effectively at higher temperatures, and further increases can lead them to denature, reducing their ability to catalyse essential chemical reactions. This loss of enzymatic control affects the functioning of major organs with high energy demands such as the heart and brain. Loss of fluid and electrolytes cause heat cramps – slow muscular contraction and severe muscular spasm lasting between one and three minutes. Almost all cases of heat cramps involve vigorous physical exertion. Body temperature may remain normal or a little higher than normal and cramps are concentrated in heavily used muscles.

===Situational===

Situational heat stroke occurs in the absence of exertion. It mostly affects the young and elderly. In the elderly in particular, it can be precipitated by medications that reduce vasodilation and sweating, such as anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines, and diuretics. In this situation, the body&#x27;s tolerance for high environmental temperature may be insufficient, even at rest.

Heat waves are often followed by a rise in the death rate, and these &#x27;classical hyperthermia&#x27; deaths typically involve the elderly and infirm. This is partly because thermoregulation involves cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems which may be inadequate for the additional stress because of the existing burden of aging and disease, further compromised by medications. During the July 1995 heatwave in Chicago, there were at least 700 heat-related deaths. The strongest risk factors were being confined to bed, and living alone, while the risk was reduced for those with working air conditioners and those with access to transportation. Even then, reported deaths may be underestimated as diagnosis can be mis-classified as stroke or heart attack.

===Drugs===
Some drugs cause excessive internal heat production. The rate of drug-induced hyperthermia is higher where use of these drugs is higher.
* Many psychotropic medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and tricyclic antidepressants, can cause hyperthermia. Serotonin syndrome is a rare adverse reaction to overdose of these medications or the use of several simultaneously. Similarly, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an uncommon reaction to neuroleptic agents. These syndromes are differentiated by other associated symptoms, such as tremor in serotonin syndrome and &quot;lead-pipe&quot; muscle rigidity in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
* Recreational drugs such as amphetamines and cocaine, PCP, dextromethorphan, LSD, and MDMA may cause hyperthermia.
* Malignant hyperthermia is a rare reaction to common anesthetic agents (such as halothane) or the paralytic agent succinylcholine. Those who have this reaction, which is potentially fatal, have a genetic predisposition.
* The use of anticholinergics, more specifically muscarinic antagonists are thought to cause mild hyperthermic episodes due to its parasympatholytic effects. The sympathetic nervous system, also known as the &quot;fight-or-flight response&quot;, dominates by raising catecholamine levels by the blocked action of the &quot;rest and digest system&quot;.
* Drugs that decouple oxidative phosphorylation may also cause hyperthermia. From this group of drugs the most well-known is 2,4-dinitrophenol which was used as a weight loss drug until dangers from its use became apparent.

===Personal protective equipment===
Those working in industry, in the military, or as first responders may be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) against hazards such as chemical agents, gases, fire, small arms and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). PPE includes a range of hazmat suits, firefighting turnout gear, body armor and bomb suits, among others. Depending on design, the wearer may be encapsulated in a microclimate, due to an increase in thermal resistance and decrease in vapor permeability. As physical work is performed, the body&#x27;s natural thermoregulation (i.e. sweating) becomes ineffective. This is compounded by increased work rates, high ambient temperature and humidity levels, and direct exposure to the sun. The net effect is that desired protection from some environmental threats inadvertently increases the threat of heat stress.

The effect of PPE on hyperthermia has been noted in fighting the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic in Western Africa. Doctors and healthcare workers were only able to work for 40 minutes at a time in their protective suits, fearing heat stroke.

===Other===
Other rare causes of hyperthermia include thyrotoxicosis and an adrenal gland tumor, called pheochromocytoma, both of which can cause increased heat production. Damage to the central nervous system from brain hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, and other kinds of injury to the hypothalamus can also cause hyperthermia.

==Pathophysiology==
A fever occurs when the core temperature is set higher, through the action of the pre-optic region of the anterior hypothalamus. For example, in response to a bacterial or viral infection, certain white blood cells within the blood will release pyrogens which have a direct effect on the anterior hypothalamus, causing body temperature to rise, much like raising the temperature setting on a thermostat.

In contrast, hyperthermia occurs when the body temperature rises without a change in the heat control centers.

Some of the gastrointestinal symptoms of acute exertional heatstroke, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding, may be caused by barrier dysfunction and subsequent endotoxemia. Ultraendurance athletes have been found to have significantly increased plasma endotoxin levels. Endotoxin stimulates many inflammatory cytokines, which in turn may cause multiorgan dysfunction. Experimentally, monkeys treated with oral antibiotics prior to induction of heat stroke do not become endotoxemic.

There is scientific support for the concept of a temperature set point; that is, maintenance of an optimal temperature for the metabolic processes that life depends on. Nervous activity in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus of the brain triggers heat losing (sweating, etc.) or heat generating (shivering and muscle contraction, etc.) activities through stimulation of the autonomic nervous system. The pre-optic anterior hypothalamus has been shown to contain warm sensitive, cool sensitive, and temperature insensitive neurons, to determine the body&#x27;s temperature setpoint. As the temperature that these neurons are exposed to rises above , the rate of electrical discharge of the warm-sensitive neurons increases progressively. Cold-sensitive neurons increase their rate of electrical discharge progressively below .

==Diagnosis==
Hyperthermia is generally diagnosed by the combination of unexpectedly high body temperature and a history that supports hyperthermia instead of a fever. Most commonly this means that the elevated temperature has occurred in a hot, humid environment (heat stroke) or in someone taking a drug for which hyperthermia is a known side effect (drug-induced hyperthermia). The presence of signs and symptoms related to hyperthermia syndromes, such as extrapyramidal symptoms characteristic of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and the absence of signs and symptoms more commonly related to infection-related fevers, are also considered in making the diagnosis.

If fever-reducing drugs lower the body temperature, even if the temperature does not return entirely to normal, then hyperthermia is excluded.

==Prevention==
When ambient temperature is excessive, humans and many other animals cool themselves below ambient by evaporative cooling of sweat (or other aqueous liquid; saliva in dogs, for example); this helps prevent potentially fatal hyperthermia. The effectiveness of evaporative cooling depends upon humidity. Wet-bulb temperature, which takes humidity into account, or more complex calculated quantities such as wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which also takes solar radiation into account, give useful indications of the degree of heat stress and are used by several agencies as the basis for heat-stress prevention guidelines. (Wet-bulb temperature is essentially the lowest skin temperature attainable by evaporative cooling at a given ambient temperature and humidity.)

A sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding is likely to be fatal even to fit and healthy people unclothed in the shade next to a fan; at this temperature, environmental heat gain instead of loss occurs. , wet-bulb temperatures only very rarely exceeded anywhere, although significant global warming may change this.

In cases of heat stress caused by physical exertion, hot environments, or protective equipment, prevention or mitigation by frequent rest breaks, careful hydration, and monitoring body temperature should be attempted. However, in situations demanding one is exposed to a hot environment for a prolonged period or must wear protective equipment, a personal cooling system is required as a matter of health and safety. There are a variety of active or passive personal cooling systems; these can be categorized by their power sources and whether they are person- or vehicle-mounted.

Because of the broad variety of operating conditions, these devices must meet specific requirements concerning their rate and duration of cooling, their power source, and their adherence to health and safety regulations. Among other criteria are the user&#x27;s need for physical mobility and autonomy. For example, active-liquid systems operate by chilling water and circulating it through a garment; the skin surface area is thereby cooled through conduction. This type of system has proven successful in certain military, law enforcement, and industrial applications. Bomb-disposal technicians wearing special suits to protect against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) use a small, ice-based chiller unit that is strapped to one leg; a liquid-circulating garment, usually a vest, is worn over the torso to maintain a safe core body temperature. By contrast, soldiers traveling in combat vehicles can face microclimate temperatures in excess of and require a multiple-user, vehicle-powered cooling system with rapid connection capabilities. Requirements for hazmat teams, the medical community, and workers in heavy industry vary further.

==Treatment==
The underlying cause must be removed. Mild hyperthemia caused by exertion on a hot day may be adequately treated through self-care measures, such as increased water consumption and resting in a cool place. Hyperthermia that results from drug exposure requires prompt cessation of that drug, and occasionally the use of other drugs as counter measures.

Antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have no role in the treatment of heatstroke because antipyretics interrupt the change in the hypothalamic set point caused by pyrogens; they are not expected to work on a healthy hypothalamus that has been overloaded, as in the case of heatstroke. In this situation, antipyretics actually may be harmful in patients who develop hepatic, hematologic, and renal complications because they may aggravate bleeding tendencies.

When body temperature is significantly elevated, mechanical cooling methods are used to remove heat and to restore the body&#x27;s ability to regulate its own temperatures. Passive cooling techniques, such as resting in a cool, shady area and removing clothing can be applied immediately. Active cooling methods, such as sponging the head, neck, and trunk with cool water, remove heat from the body and thereby speed the body&#x27;s return to normal temperatures. When methods such as immersion are impractical, misting the body with water and using a fan have also been shown to be effective.

Sitting in a bathtub of tepid or cool water (immersion method) can remove a significant amount of heat in a relatively short period of time. It was once thought that immersion in very cold water is counterproductive, as it causes vasoconstriction in the skin and thereby prevents heat from escaping the body core. However, a British analysis of various studies stated: &quot;this has never been proven experimentally. Indeed, a recent study using normal volunteers has shown that cooling rates were fastest when the coldest water was used.&quot; The analysis concluded that iced water immersion is the most-effective cooling technique for exertional heat stroke. No superior cooling method has been found for &quot;non-exertional heat stroke&quot;. Thus, aggressive &quot;ice-water&quot; immersion remains the gold standard for &quot;life-threatening heat stroke&quot;.

When the body temperature reaches about , or if the affected person is unconscious or showing signs of confusion, hyperthermia is considered a medical emergency that requires treatment in a proper medical facility. A cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be necessary if the person goes into cardiac arrest (stop of heart beats). Already in a hospital, more aggressive cooling measures are available, including intravenous hydration, gastric lavage with iced saline, and even hemodialysis to cool the blood.

==Epidemiology== 
Hyperthermia affects those who are unable to regulate their body heat, mainly due to environmental conditions. The main risk factor for hyperthermia is the lack of ability to sweat. People who are dehydrated or who are older may not produce the sweat they need to regulate their body temperature. High heat conditions can put certain groups at risk for hyperthermia including: physically active individuals, soldiers, construction workers, landscapers and factory workers. Some people that do not have access to cooler living conditions, like people with lower socioeconomic status, may have a difficult time fighting the heat. People are at risk for hyperthermia during high heat and dry conditions, most commonly seen in the summer.

Various cases of different types of hyperthermia have been reported. A research study was published in March 2019 that looked into multiple case reports of drug induced hyperthermia. The study concluded that psychotropic drugs such as anti-psychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytics were associated with an increased heat-related mortality as opposed to the other drugs researched (anticholinergics, diuretics, cardiovascular agents, etc.). A different study was published in June 2019 that examined the association between hyperthermia in older adults and the temperatures in the United States. Hospitalization records of elderly patients in the US between 1991 and 2006 were analyzed and concluded that cases of hyperthermia were observed to be highest in regions with arid climates. The study discussed finding a disproportionately high number of cases of hyperthermia in early seasonal heat waves indicating that people were not yet practicing proper techniques to stay cool and prevent overheating in the early presence of warm, dry weather.

In urban areas people are at an increased susceptibility to hyperthermia. This is due to a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect. Since the 20th century in the United States, the north-central region (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska) was the region with the highest morbidity resulting from hyperthermia. Northeastern states had the next highest. Regions least affected by heat wave-related hyperthermia causing death were Southern and Pacific Coastal states. Northern cities in the United States are at greater risk of hyperthermia during heat waves due to the fact that people tend to have a lower minimum mortality temperature at higher latitudes. In contrast, cities residing in lower latitudes within the continental US typically have higher thresholds for ambient temperatures. In India, hundreds die every year from summer heat waves, including more than 2,500 in the year 2015. Later that same summer, the 2015 Pakistani heat wave killed about 2,000 people. An extreme 2003 European heat wave caused tens of thousands of deaths.

Causes of hyperthermia include dehydration, use of certain medications, using cocaine and amphetamines or excessive alcohol use. Bodily temperatures greater than can be diagnosed as a hyperthermic case. As body temperatures increase or excessive body temperatures persist, individuals are at a heightened risk of developing progressive conditions. Greater risk complications of hyperthermia include heat stroke, organ malfunction, organ failure, and death. There are two forms of heat stroke; classical heatstroke and exertional heatstroke. Classical heatstroke occurs from extreme environmental conditions, such as heat waves. Those who are most commonly affected by classical heatstroke are very young, elderly or chronically ill. Exertional heatstroke appears in individuals after vigorous physical activity. Exertional heatstroke is displayed most commonly in healthy 15-50 year old people. Sweating is often present in exertional heatstroke. The associated mortality rate of heatstroke is 40 to 64%.

==Research==
Hyperthermia can also be deliberately induced using drugs or medical devices, and is being studied and applied in clinical routine as a treatment of some kinds of cancer. Research has shown that medically controlled hyperthermia can shrink tumours. This occurs when a high body temperature damages cancerous cells by destroying proteins and structures within each cell. Hyperthermia has also been researched to investigate whether it causes cancerous tumours to be more prone to radiation as a form of treatment; which as a result has allowed hyperthermia to be used to complement other forms of cancer therapy. Various techniques of hyperthermia in the treatment of cancer include local or regional hyperthermia, as well as whole body techniques.

<doc id="75655" wikidata="Q2976561" url="?curid=75655" title="Game classification">
<text>Game classification is the classification of games, forming a game taxonomy. Many different methods of classifying games exist.

== Physical education ==
There are four basic approaches to classifying the games used in physical education:
;Game categories: This is a classification scheme proposed by Nicols, who classifies games according to three major categories: the game&#x27;s physical requirements (i.e. what the game requires in addition to the players — equipment, size and nature of playing field, and so forth), the structure of the game (i.e. number of players, groupings of players, strategies, and so forth), and the game&#x27;s personal requirements (i.e. what the game requires of the player — motor skills, fitness levels, numeracy, social skills, and so forth).
;Games for understanding: This is a classification scheme proposed by Werner and Alomond that classifies games according to their strategies. It divides games into target games (e.g. archery); net or wall games (e.g. tennis); striking and field games (e.g. cricket); and invasion games (e.g. football).
;Core content: This is a classification scheme proposed by Allison and Barrett that categorizes games by their form (i.e. whether they are novel games proposed by the teacher or children, or whether they are existing games already widely played), by the movement skills that they require, by the &quot;movement concepts&quot; and game tactics that they require, and by the educational results of the game.
;Developmental games: This is a classification scheme proposed by Gallahue and Celand that classifies games into four developmental levels, as part of an overall educational strategy of applying, reinforcing, and implementing movement and sports skills. The levels, in ascending order, are &quot;low-level&quot;, &quot;complex&quot;, &quot;lead-up&quot;, and &quot;official sports&quot;.
Games further divided as per the physical activity are mainly divided into three categories: soft active sports, medium active sports, and highly active sports. 

== Video games ==
There are several methods of classifying video games, alongside the system of video game genres commonly used by retailers and player communities.

Solomon puts forward a &quot;commonsense, but broad&quot; classification of video games, into simulations (the game reflects reality), abstract games (the game itself is the focus of interest), and sports. In addition to these, he points out that games (in general, not just video games) fall into classes according to the number of players. Games with two players encompass board games such as chess. Games with multiple players encompass card games such as poker, and marketed family games such as Monopoly and Scrabble. Puzzles and Solitaire are one-player games. He also includes zero-player games, such as Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, although acknowledging that others argue that such games do not constitute a game, because they lack any element of competition. He asserts that such zero-player games are nonetheless games because they are used recreationally.

Another method, developed by Wright, divides games into the following categories: educational or informative, sports, sensorimotor (e.g. action games, video games, fighting and shoot &#x27;em up games, and driving and racing simulators), other vehicular simulators (not covered by driving and racing), strategy games (e.g. adventure games, war games, strategic simulations, role-playing games, and puzzles), and &quot;other&quot;.

A third method, developed by Funk and Buchman, and refined by others, classifies electronic games into six categories: general entertainment (no fighting or destruction), educational (learning or problem-solving), fantasy violence (cartoon characters that must fight or destroy things, and risk being killed, to achieve a goal), human violence (like fantasy violence, but with human rather than cartoon characters), nonviolent sports (no fighting or destruction), and sports violence (fighting or destruction involved).

== Classification by causes of uncertainty ==

Games can be categorized by the source of uncertainty which confront the players:
* Chance
* Combinatorics (a large number of sequences of moves)
* Different states of information among the players (each player knows only his own cards)
Based on these three causes, three classes of games arise:
* Combinatorial games
* Games of bluffing and strategy
* Games of chance

== Game theory ==

Game theory classifies games according to several criteria: whether a game is a symmetric game or an asymmetric one, what a game&#x27;s &quot;sum&quot; is (zero-sum, constant sum, and so forth), whether a game is a sequential game or a simultaneous one, whether a game comprises perfect information or imperfect information, and whether a game is determinate.

<doc id="75656" wikidata="Q320394" url="?curid=75656" title="Battle of Almansa">
<text>The Battle of Almansa took place on 25 April 1707, during the War of the Spanish Succession. It was fought between an army loyal to Philip V of Spain, Bourbon claimant to the Spanish throne, and one supporting his Habsburg rival, Archduke Charles of Austria. The result was a decisive Bourbon victory that reclaimed most of eastern Spain for Philip.

The Bourbon army was commanded by the Duke of Berwick, illegitimate son of James II of England, while Habsburg forces were led by Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway, an exiled French Huguenot. This makes it &quot;probably the only battle in history in which the English forces were commanded by a Frenchman, the French by an Englishman.&quot;

==Background==
Campaigning in Spain and size of the armies involved were limited by logistics to a greater extent than Flanders or Italy. Reliance on local sources for forage and other supplies limited operations in arid areas like Northern Spain, that until the advent of railways in the 19th century, goods and supplies were largely transported by water. Control of the seas allowed the Allies to successfully conduct short-term offensives outside the coastal areas but lack of popular support meant they could not hold territory. The Grand Alliance secured an operations base in Lisbon when Peter II of Portugal changed sides in May 1703, and the following March, Archduke Charles of Austria arrived to head a land campaign. 

The Bourbon alliance between France and Spain won a series of minor victories along the Spanish-Portuguese border, offset by the British capture of Gibraltar; attempts to retake it were defeated at the naval Battle of Málaga in August 1704, with a land siege being abandoned in April 1705. The 1705 &#x27;Pact of Genoa&#x27; between English and Catalan representatives opened a second front in the north-east; the Allied capture of Barcelona and Valencia left Toulon as the only major port available to the Bourbons in the Western Mediterranean. 

An attempt in May 1706 by Philip V of Spain to retake Barcelona failed, while his absence allowed an Allied force to capture Madrid and Zaragossa but they could not be resupplied so far from their bases and were forced to withdraw. By November 1706, Philip controlled the Crown of Castile, Murcia and parts of the Kingdom of Valencia. Over the course of 1706, Allied victories in the Spanish Netherlands and Italy forced the French onto the defensive and Galway sought to take advantage by launching a new offensive in 1707. To counter this, James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick, was appointed commander of Bourbon forces in North-East Spain, a total of 33,000 men, split equally between French and Spanish troops, with a number of exiled Irish regiments. 

Before beginning his advance on Valencia, Berwick detached 8,000 men to besiege Xàtiva, prompting the Earl of Peterborough, Allied commander in Spain, to consolidate his forces in Catalonia, rather than combine with the 16,500 troops led by Galway and Minas. This left them badly outnumbered when they moved to intercept Berwick. On 22 April, Berwick halted outside the town of Almansa, from where he could threaten supply lines for the Allied garrison in Valencia.

==Battle==
The Allies broke camp early on 25 April and reached Almansa after a long and tiring march. Berwick had drawn up his army in two lines, just in front of the town, his infantry in the centre and the French and Spanish cavalry on the wings. Although Galway was clearly outnumbered, he commenced his attack in mid-afternoon after a short artillery exchange. His infantry successfully drove back the Bourbon centre but a gap opened between them and Portuguese troops on the right, under the 63-year-old Marquess of Minas. Seeing this, the Franco-Spanish cavalry attacked; Berwick&#x27;s account states the Portuguese fought bravely for some time but eventually collapsed and fled. Their retreat was covered by a few squadrons under Das Minas&#x27; personal command, including his mistress, who fought dressed as a man and was killed.

The Allied centre was now attacked on three sides; using his remaining cavalry, Galway successfully withdrew some of his troops but 13 battalions lost contact with the rest of the army. Pursued by the Spanish cavalry, they took up a defensive position some 8 miles (12 km) from the battlefield but surrendered the next morning; according to Henry Kamen, allied casualties were 4,000 killed or wounded and 3,000 captured, with Franco-Spanish losses around 5,000 killed or wounded. French military historian Périni claimed Franco-Spanish casualties totalled around 2,000 killed or wounded, with the Allies losing 5,000 casualties and 10,000 prisoners, but from a larger force than 16,500 men. Périni also accepts the bulk of the cavalry escaped, some 3,500 men. According to Gaston Bodart, the Franco-Spanish lost 2,000 men from an army of 21,000 and the allies 12,000 men (5,000 killed or wounded and 7,000 captured) from a force of 16,000. Finally, according to Joaquim Albareda, the Bourbon forces lost 1,500 men, whereas total allied losses were around 7,000. 

==Aftermath==
Almansa has been described as &quot;the single most important battle fought in Spain during the war&quot;. Berwick&#x27;s tactics were admired by many, Frederick the Great later describing it as the most impressive battle of the century. Victory confirmed Philip&#x27;s control of North-East Spain and Valencia, while by the end of 1707 the Allies were once again restricted to Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. 

The Franco-Spanish army followed up their success by besieging Xàtiva; when it surrendered in June, much of the town was destroyed and its name changed to &#x27;San Felipe.&#x27; In memory of these events, a portrait of the monarch still hangs upside down in the local museum. The defeat and its consequences for the autonomy of Valencia and Catalonia gave rise to two modern proverbs; &quot;De ponent, ni vent ni gent,&quot; (&#x27;From the west, neither wind nor people&#x27;) and &quot;Quan el mal ve d&#x27;Almansa, a tots alcança,&quot; (&#x27;Bad news from Almansa reaches everybody&#x27;).

<doc id="75660" wikidata="Q254843" url="?curid=75660" title="Sweat lodge">
<text>A sweat lodge is a low profile hut, typically dome-shaped or oblong, and made with natural materials. The structure is the &quot;lodge&quot;, and the ceremony performed within the structure may be called by some cultures a purification ceremony or simply a sweat. 

Traditionally the structure is simple, constructed of saplings covered with blankets and sometimes animal skins. The induction of sweating is a spiritual ceremony – it is for prayer and healing, and it is only to be led by Indigenous Elders who know the language, songs, traditions, and safety protocols of their culture&#x27;s inherited tradition. Otherwise, the ceremony can be dangerous if performed improperly.

The ceremony is traditional to some Indigenous peoples of the Americas, predominantly those from the Plains cultures, but with the rise of pan-Indianism, numerous nations that did not originally have the sweat lodge ceremony have learned the ceremony from other Nations. Sweat lodges have also been imitated by many non-natives in North America and internationally, resulting in responses from Indigenous Elders declaring that these imitations are dangerous and disrespectful misappropriations.

== Traditions ==

Native Americans in many regions have sweat lodge ceremonies. For example, Chumash peoples of the central coast of California build sweat lodges in coastal areas in association with habitation sites. The ancient Mesoamerican tribes of Mexico, such as the Aztec and Olmec, practiced a sweat bath ceremony known as temazcal as a religious rite of penance and purification.

Traditions associated with sweating vary regionally and culturally. Ceremonies often include traditional prayers and songs. In some cultures drumming and offerings to the spirit world may be part of the ceremony, or a sweat lodge ceremony may be a part of another, longer ceremony such as a Sun Dance. Some common practices and key elements associated with sweat lodges include:
* Training – Indigenous cultures with sweat lodge traditions require that someone go through intensive training for many years to be allowed to lead a lodge. One of the requirements is that the leader be able to pray and communicate fluently in the Indigenous language of that culture, and that they understand how to conduct the ceremony safely. This leadership role is granted by the Elders of the community, not self-designated. This leadership is only entrusted to those who are full members of the community, and who live in community. It is never given to outsiders who then leave to sell ceremony.
* Orientation – The door may face a sacred fire. The cardinal directions may have symbolism in the culture that is holding the sweating ceremony. The lodge may be oriented within its environment for a specific purpose. Placement and orientation of the lodge within its environment are often considered to facilitate the ceremony&#x27;s connection with the spirit world, as well as practical considerations of usage.
* Construction – The lodge is generally built with great care and knowledge, and with respect for the environment and for the materials being used.
* Clothing – In Native American lodges participants usually wear a simple garment such as shorts or a loose dress. Modesty is important, rather than display.
Some participants will go nude as it is considered the “traditional” way.

== Risks ==
=== Physical effects ===
Even people who are experienced with sweat rituals, or who attend a ceremony led by a properly trained and authorized traditional Native American ceremonial leader, could suddenly experience problems due to underlying health issues. It is recommended by Lakota spiritual leaders that people only attend lodges with authorized, traditional spiritual leaders.

There have been reports of lodge-related deaths resulting from overexposure to heat, dehydration, smoke inhalation, or improper lodge construction leading to suffocation.

If rocks are used, it is important not to use river rocks, or other kinds of rocks with air pockets inside them. Rocks must be completely dry before heating. Rocks with air pockets or excessive moisture could crack and possibly explode in the fire or when hit by water. Previously used rocks may absorb humidity or moisture leading to cracks or shattering.

=== Deaths ===
The following is a list of reported deaths related to non-traditional &quot;New Age&quot; sweat rituals:
* Gordon Reynolds, 43 (died November 21, 1996)
* Kirsten Babcock, 34 (died 2002)
* David Thomas Hawker, 36 (died 2002)
* Rowen Cooke, 37 (died 2004)
* Paige Martin, 57 (died July 17, 2009)
* Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, NY (died October 9, 2009, at retreat led by James Arthur Ray)
* Lizbeth Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, MN (died October 17, 2009, due to injuries sustained at retreat led by James Arthur Ray)
* James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, WI (died October 9, 2009, at event led by James Arthur Ray)
* Chantal Lavigne, 35, (died July 2011 in Sherbrooke, Québec, after event led by Gabrielle Fréchette)

=== Sedona deaths and Lakota Nation lawsuit ===
In October 2009, during a New Age retreat organized by James Arthur Ray, three people died and 21 more became ill while attending an overcrowded and improperly set up sweat lodge containing some 60 people and located near Sedona, Arizona. Ray was arrested by the Yavapai County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in connection with the deaths on February 3, 2010, and bond was set at $5 million. In response to these deaths, Lakota spiritual leader Arvol Looking Horse issued a statement reading in part:

On November 2, 2009, the Lakota Nation filed a lawsuit against the United States, Arizona State, James Arthur Ray, and Angel Valley Retreat Center site owners, to have Ray and the site owners arrested and punished under the Sioux Treaty of 1868 between the United States and the Lakota Nation. That treaty states that “if bad men among the whites or other people subject to the authority of the United States shall commit any wrong upon the person or the property of the Indians, the United States will (...) proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States, and also reimburse the injured person for the loss sustained.”

The Lakota Nation holds that James Arthur Ray and the Angel Valley Retreat Center have “violated the peace between the United States and the Lakota Nation” and have caused the “desecration of our Sacred &quot;Oinikiga&quot; (purification ceremony) by causing the death of Liz Neuman, Kirby Brown and James Shore”. As well, the Lakota claim that James Arthur Ray and the Angel Valley Retreat Center fraudulently impersonated Indians and must be held responsible for causing the deaths and injuries, and for evidence destruction through dismantling of the sweat lodge. The lawsuit seeks to have the treaty enforced and does not seek monetary compensation.

Preceding the lawsuit, Native American experts on sweat lodges criticized the reported construction and conduct of the lodge as not meeting traditional ways (&quot;bastardized&quot;, &quot;mocked&quot; and &quot;desecrated&quot;). Indian leaders expressed concerns and prayers for the dead and injured. The leaders said the ceremony is their way of life and not a religion. It is Native American property protected by U.S. law and United Nations declaration. The ceremony should only be in sanctioned lodge carriers&#x27; hands from legitimate nations. Traditionally, a typical leader has 4 to 8 years of apprenticeship before being allowed to care for people in a lodge, and have been officially named as ceremonial leaders before the community. Participants are instructed to call out whenever they feel uncomfortable, and the ceremony is usually stopped to help them. The lodge was said to be unusually built from non-breathable materials. Charging for the ceremony was said to be inappropriate. The number of participants was criticized as too high and the ceremony length was said to be too long. Respect to elders&#x27; oversight was said to be important for avoiding unfortunate events. The tragedy was characterized as &quot;plain carelessness&quot;, with a disregard for the participants&#x27; safety and outright negligence. The Native American community actively seeks to prevent abuses of their traditions. Organizers have been discussing ways to formalize guidance and oversight to authentic or independent lodge leaders.

== Similar structures and rites in other cultures ==
There are examples of ritual sweating in other cultures, though often without any ceremonial or mystical significance. Secular uses around the world include many forms of Ancient Roman baths, steambath, sauna, Slavic banya, Victorian Turkish bath and the culturally important Islamic variant, the hammam. Other varieties are used by Indigenous people around the Bering Strait, ancient Greeks, the Finns and Laplanders.

Some European cultures have historically used sweating for cleansing. In most cases the usage is primarily for physical cleansing and warmth, but in others prayer and songs may be involved. Scandinavian, Baltic and Eastern European cultures incorporate sweat baths in their sauna traditions, which are held within a permanent, wooden hut. While modern-day saunas are wholly secular, there are older traditions of songs and rituals in the sauna, and the acknowledgment of a spirit-being who lives in the sauna.

&quot;Vapour baths were in use among the Celtic tribes, and the sweat-house was in general use in Ireland down to the 18th, and even survived into the 19th century. It was of beehive shape and was covered with clay. It was especially resorted to as a cure for rheumatism.&quot; These permanent structures were built of stone, and square or corbelled &quot;beehive&quot; versions are often found, mostly in the Irish and Gaelic-speaking areas of Ireland and Scotland, though most seem of relatively recent date. The method of construction, heating the structure, and usage was different from the North American examples, and they seem to have been regarded as therapeutic in function, like the sauna, and perhaps typically used by one person at a time, given their small size.

<doc id="75682" wikidata="Q1850959" url="?curid=75682" title="List of World Chess Championships">
<text>The World Chess Championship has taken various forms over time, including both match and tournament play. While the concept of a world champion of chess had already existed for decades, with several events considered by some to have established the world&#x27;s foremost player, an event explicitly held to decide a world champion did not take place until 1886. World Championships were initially privately organized matches, with each requiring the consent of the incumbent champion to take place. After 1948, the International Chess Federation (FIDE) began organizing the Championship under its auspices. The championship was fixed to a three-year cycle, with each challenger decided by a Candidates Tournament. In 1993, the short-lived Professional Chess Association (PCA) split from FIDE, and as a result there were two competing World Championship titles between 1993 and 2006.

== Key ==
== Predecessor events (before 1886) ==
Chess was first introduced to Europe during the 9th century. In the early modern era, following the solidification of the modern rules of chess, the game continued to carry consistent prestige and public interest. While numerous players have been characterized as the game&#x27;s strongest over the centuries, the idea of an international chess match or tournament did not occur until the 18th century, and did not materialize until the 19th century. While the following events did not have the title of World Champion at stake, they have been recognized either at the time or in retrospect as indicating the world&#x27;s leading player.


== Privately organized matches (1886–1946) ==
With both Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort seen as plausible claimants, the two played a match for the first World Championship in 1886. While Steinitz would later claim that he had been the World Champion since the 1860s, no match before 1886 was played for any formal title. From then until after World War II, championship matches were privately organized, and the champion was not formally obliged to face an opponent. An agreement had to be reached between the champion, the challenger, and the patrons sponsoring each match, which included providing the funds for the prize pool. Lasker&#x27;s 27-year reign as World Champion is the longest in the history of organized chess since 1886, but featured two separate 10-year spans during which he did not defend his title.


== FIDE World Championships (1948–1990) ==

In 1946, Alexander Alekhine died while still holding the title of World Chess Champion. The International Chess Federation (FIDE), which had been founded in 1924, had been attempting to directly participate in organizing the World Championship since at least 1935. By the late 1940s, around half of the plausible contenders for the World Championship were Soviet citizens, and in 1947, the Soviet Chess Federation joined FIDE after decades of declining to do so. FIDE based the 1948 World Chess Championship on the 1938 AVRO tournament that had been organized in part to select a challenger for Alekhine. The tournament ultimately featured five players, three of them Soviet citizens—including the winner, Mikhail Botvinnik. Botvinnik went on to win or retain in four further championship matches. At the same time, FIDE established the rules for the championship going forward. It was organized around a 3-year cycle, during which a series of Zonal and Interzonal tournaments were held, with their highest-scoring performers invited to a Candidates Tournament. The winner of the Candidates tournament in turn played the champion in a match for the title. A defeated champion was entitled to a rematch the following year, after which the 3-year cycle would resume. Botvinnik benefited from this rule twice, in 1958 and 1961.

With the exception of the American Bobby Fischer in 1972, Soviet citizens won every championship from 1948 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. With the further exception of Viktor Korchnoi, who had defected from the USSR in 1976, each challenger was also a Soviet citizen. Following his victory, Fischer never played another game organized by FIDE. Disagreements between the two parties—which included Fischer&#x27;s insistence on a format that required the victor to get a certain number of wins, as opposed to the number of games in a match being fixed—led to his forfeiting the title in 1975. In the absence of a match, FIDE declared Anatoly Karpov, winner of the 1974 Candidates Tournament, to be the World Chess Champion by default.

While the issue had played a role in Fischer&#x27;s forfeit, FIDE ultimately did change the match format going forward, such that the first to win 6 games would be champion. Under these rules, Karpov twice defended his title against Korchnoi. The next match—which began in September 1984 and featured the 21-year-old Garry Kasparov as Karpov&#x27;s challenger—ultimately saw 48 games played over the span of five months, with neither player able to get to 6 wins. In an unprecedented step, FIDE president Florencio Campomanes stepped in and declared the match to have ended with no result. A new match, reverted to having a set number of games, was to be played later in 1985. After nearly being knocked out early in 1984, Kasparov defeated Karpov in their rematch. Over the following decade, the two played three more championship matches, with Kasparov narrowly retaining the title in each.


== Split title (1993–2006) ==

In 1993, following Nigel Short&#x27;s victory in the Candidates Tournament, FIDE president Campomanes announced that that year&#x27;s Championship would take place in Manchester, England. Both Kasparov and Short claimed that FIDE had made this decision without consulting either player, in violation of FIDE&#x27;s regulations regarding the championship. Kasparov and Short responded by splitting from FIDE and forming the Professional Chess Association (PCA), which organized a World Championship match between the two, played in London later that year. Meanwhile, FIDE stripped Kasparov of his title and organized a championship match between Karpov and Jan Timman, who had finished second and third in the Candidates Tournament. For the 13 years between 1993 and 2006, there were two rival titles. While the PCA itself would fold after only a couple of years, Kasparov would retain what is referred to as &quot;Classical&quot; title, which would be inherited by Vladimir Kramnik upon defeating Kasparov in 2000.

Meanwhile, FIDE once again began experimenting with the championship format. Beginning with the 1998 championship, the system of Zonal, Interzonal, Candidates, and Championship stages was replaced with one single-elimination tournament featuring dozens of players competing for the championship. For the next event in 1999, the incumbent World Champion would not automatically qualify for the finals. Due to this additional change, Karpov—who had won three additional titles during the schism—declined to participate going forward. Each of the four Classical Championships retained a traditional match format.


== FIDE World Championships (2006–present) ==

Following a period of negotiation, in 2006 the Classical Champion Vladimir Kramnik played a match against the FIDE Champion Veselin Topalov to reunify the World Championship. Since then, the championship has remained under the auspices of FIDE. The Candidates Tournament returned, and with the exception of the 2007 tournament, FIDE would return to a match format for the World Championship. Instead of the previous system of Zonals and Interzonals to provide candidates, the system was redesigned around the Chess World Cup. Later, means for selecting candidates would variously include the FIDE Grand Prix, the FIDE Grand Swiss Tournament, selection by rating, and wild cards selected by the venue hosting the event.

While shorter matches had taken place at various points, the block of 12 classical games was much shorter than matches had been for much of the 20th century. In the 2018 match, all 12 classical games resulted in draws for the first time in the history of the championship. Following this, the number of games was increased to 14. Citing a lack of motivation and interest in the format, incumbent five-time champion Magnus Carlsen declined to defend his title in 2023. Instead, the match featured the two best performers in the Candidates, with Ding Liren defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi to become the new World Champion. Carlsen later declined his spot in the 2024 Candidates Tournament.


== Unrecognized championship events ==
In 1909, amid discussions that would ultimately culminate with the World Championship match played the following year, Emanuel Lasker played a casual match with Dawid Janowski in Paris. This was reported in later decades as being a World Championship match. However, research by Edward Winter has demonstrated that the title was not at stake.

<doc id="75691" wikidata="Q3053778" url="?curid=75691" title="Betting in poker">
<text>In the game of poker, the play largely centers on the act of betting, and as such, a protocol has been developed to speed up play, lessen confusion, and increase security while playing. Different games are played using different types of bets, and small variations in etiquette exist between cardrooms, but for the most part the following rules and protocol are observed by the majority of poker players.

==Procedure==
Players in a poker game act in turn, in clockwise rotation (acting out of turn can negatively affect other players). When it is a player&#x27;s turn to act, the first verbal declaration or action they take binds them to their choice of action; this rule prevents a player from changing their action after seeing how other players react to their initial action.

Until the first bet is made each player in turn may &quot;check&quot;, which is to not place a bet, or &quot;open&quot;, which is to make the first bet. After the first bet each player may &quot;fold&quot;, which is to drop out of the hand losing any bets they have already made; &quot;call&quot;, which is to match the highest bet so far made; or &quot;raise&quot;, which is to increase the previous high bet.

A player may fold by surrendering one&#x27;s cards. (Some games may have specific rules regarding how to fold: for example in stud poker one must turn one&#x27;s upcards face down.) A player may check by tapping the table or making any similar motion. All other bets are made by placing chips in front of the player, but not directly into the pot (&quot;splashing the pot&quot; prevents other players from verifying the bet amount).

===Order of betting===

In general, the person to the left of the dealer acts first and action proceeds in a clockwise fashion. If any player has folded earlier, action proceeds to next player. In games with blinds, the first round of betting begins with the player to the left of the blinds. In stud games, the action begins with the player showing the strongest cards and proceeds clockwise. If there is a bring-in, the first round of betting begins with the player obliged to post the bring-in.

===Check===
If no one has yet opened the betting round, a player may pass or check, which is equivalent to betting zero and/or to call the current bet of zero. When checking, a player declines to make a bet; this indicates that they do not wish to open, but do wish to keep their cards and retain the right to call or raise later in the same round if an opponent opens. In games played with blinds, players may not check on the opening round because the blinds are live bets and must be called or raised to remain in the hand. A player who has posted the big blind has the right to raise on the first round, called the option, if no other player has raised; if they decline to raise they are said to check their option. If all players check, the betting round is over with no additional money placed in the pot (often called a free round or free card). A common way to signify checking is to tap the table, either with a fist, knuckles, an open hand or the index finger(s).

===Open, bet, raise===
If in any betting round it is a player&#x27;s turn to act and the action is unopened, then the player can open action in a betting round by making a bet—the act of making the first voluntary bet in a betting round is called opening the round. On the first betting round, it is also called opening the pot, though in variants where &quot;blind bets&quot; are common, the blind bets &quot;open&quot; the first betting round and other players call and/or raise the &quot;big blind&quot; bet. Some poker variations have special rules about opening a round that may not apply to other bets. For example, a game may have a betting structure that specifies different allowable amounts for opening than for other bets, or may require a player to hold certain cards (such as &quot;Jacks or better&quot;) to open.
Normally, a player makes a bet by placing the chips they wish to wager into the pot. Under normal circumstances, all other players still in the pot must either call the full amount of the bet or raise if they wish to remain in, the only exceptions being when a player does not have sufficient stake remaining to call the full amount of the bet (in which case they may either call with their remaining stake to go &quot;all-in&quot; or fold) or when the player is already all-in.

To raise is to increase the size of an existing bet in the same betting round. A player making the second (not counting the open) or subsequent raise of a betting round is said to re-raise. A player making a raise after previously checking in the same betting round is said to check-raise. The sum of the opening bet and all raises is the amount that all players in the hand must call in order to remain eligible to win the pot, subject to the table stakes rules described in the previous paragraph.

A bluff is when a player bets or raises when it is likely they do not have the best hand; it is often done in hopes that (an) opponent(s) will fold mediocre yet stronger hands. When a player bets or raises with a weak hand that has a chance of improvement on a later betting round, the bet or raise is classified as a semi-bluff. On the other hand, a bet made by a player who hopes or expects to be called by weaker hands is classified as a value bet.

In no-limit and pot-limit games, there is a minimum amount that is required to be bet in order to open the action. In games with blinds, this amount is usually the amount of the big blind. Modern poker rules require that raises must be at least equal to the amount of the previous bet or raise. For example, if an opponent bets $5, a player must raise by at least another $5, and they may not raise by only $2. If a player raises a bet of $5 by $7 (for a total of $12), the next re-raise would have to be by at least another $7 (the previous raise) more than the $12 (for a total of at least $19). The primary purpose of the minimum raise rule is to avoid game delays caused by &quot;nuisance&quot; raises (small raises of large bets, such as an extra $1 over a current bet of $50, that have little effect on the action but take time as all others must call). This rule is overridden by table stakes rules, so that a player may in fact raise a $5 bet by $2 if that $2 is their entire remaining stake. The only exception is if someone goes all in for less than a legal raise. For example, if the minimum bet is $5 and a player goes all in for $4, the next player can call the $4; if they want to raise, they would have to make it $9 ($4 plus the minimum bet).

In no-limit and pot-limit games, if a player opens action in a betting round by placing any number of chips in the pot without a verbal declaration, or if they place two or more chips in the pot of sufficient value to raise an outstanding bet or raise without a verbal declaration, then the full amount placed in the pot will be assumed to be the amount of the bet or raise. Sometimes, a player will not have enough chips in smaller denominations that would be needed to make a bet or raise in the desired amount—for example, a player may be out of $1 and $5 chips and still have $25 chips—if the pot is currently $70 and the player wants to open action by betting half the pot, they will want to bet $35. In such cases, instead of slowing down the game by asking the dealer or another player to provide &quot;change&quot; a player may simply verbally declare the amount they are betting while placing (a) chip(s) of sufficient value to make good on the bet. Any &quot;change&quot; will be returned to them by the dealer if necessary.

Also in no-limit and pot-limit games, a raise may be expressed as either a &quot;raise by $X&quot; or a &quot;raise to $X&quot;. For example, suppose Alice opens by betting $5. If Dianne subsequently announces &quot;I raise &quot;by&quot; $15&quot; she will be raising by $15 &quot;over and above&quot; the opening bet of $5, for a total bet of $20. On the other hand, if Dianne subsequently announces &quot;I raise &quot;to&quot; $15&quot; she will be raising by only $10 for a &quot;total bet&quot; of $15. Today, most public cardrooms prefer for players to use the &quot;raise to&quot; standard as opposed to the &quot;raise by&quot; standard. In the event of any ambiguity in a player&#x27;s verbal action while raising, the player will normally be bound to raise &quot;to&quot; the stated amount. For example, if Alice were to have opened with a $5 bet and Dianne subsequently announced &quot;raise, $15&quot; while putting $15 into pot (making the pot $20), in most public cardrooms Dianne would be bound to a &quot;total bet&quot; of $15 and the &quot;excess&quot; $5 would be returned to her.

In fixed-limit games, the size of bets and raises is determined by the specified stakes. For example, in $3/$6 fixed limit Hold &#x27;em, during the first two betting rounds (preflop and flop) the big blind is $3, the opening bet after the flop must be for $3 and all raises must be for $3. For the last two betting rounds (turn and river) the opening bet must be for $6 and all raises must be for $6. As in no-limit and pot-limit games, these amounts will be over-ridden by table stakes rules (so for example, in $3/$6 fixed limit Hold &#x27;em a player could bet, raise or call for only $2 at any time if that is their remaining stake).

Also, in fixed-limit and spread-limit games most casinos cap the total number of raises allowed in a single betting round (typically three or four, not including the opening bet of a round). For example, in a casino with a three-raise rule, if one player opens the betting for $5, the next raises by $5 making it $10, a third player raises another $5, and a fourth player raises $5 again making the current bet $20, the betting is said to be capped at that point, and no further raises beyond the $20 level will be allowed on that round. It is common to suspend this rule when there are only two players betting in the round (called being heads-up), since either player can call the last raise if they wish. Pot-limit and no-limit games do not have a limit on the number of raises.

If, because of opening or raising, there is an amount bet that the player in-turn has not paid, the player must at least match that amount, or must fold; the player cannot pass or call a lesser amount (except where table stakes rules apply).

===Call===
To call is to match a bet or match a raise. A betting round ends when all active players have bet an equal amount. If no opponents call a player&#x27;s bet or raise, the player wins the pot.

The second and subsequent calls of a particular bet amount are sometimes called overcalls. This term is also sometimes used to describe a call made by a player who has put money in the pot for this round already. A player calling a raise before they have invested money in the pot in that round is cold calling. For example, if in a betting round, Alice bets, Dianne raises, and Carol calls, Carol &quot;calls two bets cold&quot;. A player calling instead of raising with a strong hand is smooth calling or flat calling, a form of slow play.

Calling in the final betting round when a player thinks they do not have the best hand is called a crying call. Calling when a player has a relatively weak hand but suspects their opponent may be bluffing is called a hero call. Calling a bet prior to the final betting round with the intention of bluffing on a later betting round is called a float.

In public cardrooms, placing a single chip in the pot of &quot;any&quot; value sufficient to call an outstanding bet or raise without a verbal action declaring otherwise always constitutes a call. If necessary, any &quot;change&quot; from the chip will be returned to the player at the end of the betting round, or perhaps even sooner if this can conveniently be done. If, when it is a player&#x27;s turn to act, the player already has an oversized chip in the pot that has not yet been &quot;changed&quot; and that is of sufficient value to call an outstanding bet or raise, then the player may call by tapping the table as if checking.

In public cardrooms and casinos where verbal declarations are binding, the word &quot;call&quot; is such a declaration. In public card rooms, the practice of saying &quot;I call, and raise $100&quot; is considered a string raise and is not allowed. Saying &quot;I call&quot; commits the player to the action of calling, and only calling.

Note that the verb &quot;see&quot; can often be used instead of &quot;call&quot;: &quot;Dianne saw Carol&#x27;s bet&quot;, although the latter can also be used with the bettor as the object: &quot;I&#x27;ll see you&quot; means &#x27;I will call your bet&#x27;. However, terms such as &quot;overseeing&quot; and &quot;cold seeing&quot; are not valid.

===Fold===
To fold is to discard one&#x27;s hand and forfeit interest in the current pot. No further bets are required by the folding player, but the player cannot win. Folding may be indicated verbally or by discarding one&#x27;s hand face down into the pile of other discards called the muck, or into the pot (uncommon). For this reason it is also called &quot;mucking&quot;. In stud poker played in the United States, it is customary to signal folding by turning all of one&#x27;s cards face down. Once a person indicates a fold or states &quot;I fold&quot;, that person cannot re-enter the hand. In casinos in the United Kingdom, a player folds by giving their hand as is to the &quot;house&quot; dealer, who spreads the cards face up for the other players to see before mucking them.

==Etiquette==

===Action and betting===

When participating in the hand, a player is expected to keep track of the betting action. Losing track of the amount needed to call, called the bet to the player, happens occasionally, but multiple occurrences of this slow the game down and so it is discouraged. The dealer may be given the responsibility of tracking the current bet amount, from which each player has only to subtract their contribution, if any, thus far.

To aid players in tracking bets, and to ensure all players have bet the correct amount, players stack the amount they have bet in the current round in front of them. When the betting round is over (a common phrase is &quot;the pot&#x27;s good&quot;), the players will push their stacks into the pot or the dealer will gather them into the pot. Tossing chips directly into the pot (known as splashing the pot), though popular in film and television depictions of the game, causes confusion over the amount of a raise and can be used to hide the true amount of a bet. Likewise, string raises, or the act of raising by first placing chips to call and then adding chips to raise, causes confusion over the amount bet. Both actions are generally prohibited at casinos and discouraged at least in other cash games.

====Acting out of turn====
Most actions (calls, raises or folds) occurring out-of-turn—when players to the right of the player acting have not yet made decisions as to their own action—are considered improper, for several reasons. First, since actions by a player give information to other players, acting out of turn gives the person in turn information that they normally would not have, to the detriment of players who have already acted.

For instance, say that with three players in a hand, Player A has a weak hand but decides to try a bluff with a large opening bet. Player C then folds out of turn while Player B is making up their mind. Player B now knows that if they fold, A will take the pot, and also knows that they cannot be re-raised if they call. This may encourage Player B, if they have a good &quot;drawing hand&quot; (a hand currently worth nothing but with a good chance to improve substantially in subsequent rounds), to call the bet, to the disadvantage of Player A.

Second, calling or raising out of turn, in addition to the information it provides, assumes all players who would act before the out of turn player would not exceed the amount of the out-of-turn bet. This may not be the case, and would result in the player having to bet twice to cover preceding raises, which would cause confusion.

===Cards===

A player is never required to expose their concealed cards when folding or if all others have folded; this is only required at the showdown.

Many casinos and public cardrooms using a house dealer require players to protect their hands. This is done either by holding the cards or, if they are on the table, by placing a chip or other object on top. Unprotected hands in such situations are generally considered folded and are mucked by the dealer when action reaches the player. This can spark heated controversy, and is rarely done in private games.

The style of game generally determines whether players should hold face-down cards in their hands or leave them on the table. Holding &quot;hole&quot; cards allows players to view them more quickly and thus speeds up gameplay, but spectators watching over a player&#x27;s shoulder can communicate the strength of that hand to other players, even unintentionally. Unwary players can hold their hand such that a &quot;rubbernecker&quot; in an adjacent seat can sneak a peek at the cards. Lastly, given the correct light and angles, players wearing glasses can inadvertently show their opponents their hole cards through the reflection in their glasses. Thus for most poker variants involving a combination of faceup and facedown cards (most variants of stud and community are dealt in this manner), the standard method is to keep hole cards face-down on the table except when it is that player&#x27;s turn to act. Five-card draw is generally played with hands held by the players at all times.

===Cash and chips===

Making change out of the pot is allowed in most games; to avoid confusion, the player should announce their intentions first. Then, if opening or cold calling, the player may exchange a large chip for its full equivalent value out of the pot before placing their bet, or if over-calling may place the chip (announcing that they are calling or raising a lesser amount) and remove the change from their own bet for the round. Normally, if a player places one oversized chip in the pot without explicitly voicing intention while facing a bet, the action is automatically deemed a call whether or not the chip is large enough to otherwise qualify as a raise. In most casinos players are prohibited from handling chips once they are placed in the pot, although a player removing their own previous bet in the current round from the pot for the purpose of calling a raise (or re-raising) is usually tolerated. Otherwise, the dealer is expected to make change when required.

Making change should, in general, be done between hands whenever possible, when a player sees they are running low of an oft-used value. The house dealer at most casinos maintains a chip bank and can usually make change for a large amount of chips. In informal games, players can make change with each other or with unused chips in the set. While this can prevent delays while players figure out change for a bet, casinos generally frown on or outright prohibit such practices to prevent players from surreptitiously &quot;ratholing&quot; (taking away and securing part of the stakes for personal use) and/or circumventing buy-in limits. Similarly, buying in for an additional amount must be done between hands (or, at least, done after a player has folded during the current hand) since players are not allowed to add to their stack during a hand. If buy-ins cannot and/or are not expected to be handled by the dealer it can take two or three hands for an attendant to bring another tray to the table. As described below, some casinos alleviate this issue by allowing cash to be deemed temporarily &quot;in play&quot; while staff fetches chips. Players who wish to always play with at least the buy-in limit will often carry additional chips in their pocket so that whenever they lose a pot they can quickly &quot;top up&quot; without inconveniencing the dealer or delaying the game.

While having players buy chips directly from the dealer is seen as a convenience by some players, and can help deter players from exceeding buy-in limits, many players dislike this system because it slows down the game, especially if the dealer is expected to count large numbers of small denominations of chips. Also, many jurisdictions require all such purchases (or, at least, all larger transactions) to be confirmed (primarily to ensure accuracy) by a supervisor or other staff member, potentially causing further delay. To speed up play (and, by extension, increase the number of hands dealt and rake earned by the casino), many casinos require players to buy chips from a cashier—to assist players, some establishments employ chip runners to bring cash and chips to and from the tables. Many casinos have a dedicated cashier station located in or very near the poker room, although in some (usually, smaller venues) the same cashier station that handles other transactions will also handle poker-related purchases. In addition, if the casino uses the same chips for poker as for other games then it is often possible to bring chips from such games to the poker table.

Touching another player&#x27;s chips without permission is a serious breach of protocol and can result in the player being barred from the casino.

Most tournaments and many cash games require that larger denomination chips be stacked in front (i.e., closer to the center of the table, or closer to the pot) of the player&#x27;s lesser denomination chips, or at least stacked in such a manner that they can be easily seen by all opponents. This rule is employed to discourage attempts to conceal stack size. Some casinos discourage, prohibit or simply refrain from circulating larger chip denominations to prevent them from being used in lower-stakes cash games, although the drawback is that larger stacks won during play will become more difficult to handle and manage as a result.

Some informal games allow a bet to be made by placing the amount of cash on the table without converting it to chips, as this speeds up play. However, table stakes rules strictly prohibit this from being done while a hand is in progress. Other drawbacks to using cash include the ease with which cash can be &quot;ratholed&quot;, which is normally disallowed, in addition to the security risk of leaving cash on the table. As a result, many games and virtually all casinos require a formal &quot;buy-in&quot; when a player wishes to increase their stake, or at least require any cash placed on the table to be converted into chips as quickly as possible.

Players in home games typically have both cash and chips available; thus, if money for expenses other than bets is needed, such as food, drinks and fresh decks of cards, many players typically pay out of pocket. Some players (especially professionals) loathe removing any part of their stack from play for any reason, especially once their stacks exceed the initial buy-in limit. In casinos and public cardrooms, however, the use of cash is occasionally restricted or discouraged, so players often establish a small cache of chips called the &quot;kitty&quot;, used to pay for such things. Players contribute a chip of lowest value towards the kitty when they win a pot, and it pays for expenses other than bets such as tipping the dealer as well as (where applicable) to pay for &quot;rent&quot; (formally known as time fees) and/or buying fresh decks of cards (while many public cardrooms include such costs in the &quot;rake&quot; or other fees, some charge separately for such things as playing cards and &quot;rent&quot;), and similar costs.

At a casino, dealers who exchange cash for chips are expected to immediately secure any cash by placing it into a locked box near their station. This means that regardless of how chips are purchased, when cashing them in it is typically not possible to sell them back to the dealer since they have no access to any cash. Poker chips must therefore be taken to the cashier to be exchanged for cash. Dealers who handle buy-ins will often be willing (and sometimes encourage) departing players to &quot;color up&quot; their stacks by exchanging them for the highest-available denominations, both for the convenience of the player and to minimize the number of times casino staff must deliver fresh chips to the poker table—a time-consuming process. On the other hand, casinos that expect players to buy chips from the cashier will usually furnish players with chip trays (typically designed to handle 100 chips each) to ease the handling of large numbers of chips.

Chips given by players or otherwise retained by the dealer for tips, rake and other fees (where applicable) are usually placed in separate locked boxes by the dealer, although in some casinos the rake is kept in a separate row in the dealer&#x27;s tray.

===Other rules===
Public cardrooms often have additional rules designed to speed up play, earn revenue for the casino (such as the &quot;rake&quot;), improve security and discourage cheating.

==Forced bets==
All poker games require some forced bets to create an initial stake for the players to contest, as well as an initial cost of being dealt each hand for one or more players. The requirements for forced bets and the betting limits of the game (see below) are collectively called the game&#x27;s &quot;betting structure&quot;.

===Ante===
An ante is a forced bet in which all players put an equal amount of money or chips into the pot before the deal begins. Often this is either a single &quot;unit&quot; (a one-value or the smallest value in play) or some other small amount; a proportion such as a half or a quarter of the minimum bet is also common. An ante paid by every player ensures that a player who folds every round will lose money (though slowly), thus providing all players with an incentive, however small, to play the hand rather than toss it in when the opening bet reaches them.

Antes are the most common forced bet in draw poker and stud poker but are uncommon in games featuring blind bets (see next section). However, some tournament formats of games featuring blinds impose an ante to discourage extremely tight play. Antes encourage players to play more loosely by lowering the cost of staying in the hand (calling) relative to the current pot size, offering better pot odds. With antes, more players stay in the hand, which increases pot size and makes for more interesting play. This is considered important to ensure good ratings for televised tournament finals. Most televised high-stakes cash games also use both blinds and antes. Televised cash games usually have one of the players, normally the dealer, pay for everyone to accelerate play. If there are six players for example, the dealer would toss six times the ante into the pot, paying for each person. Tournaments which employ antes, often do so only in the later rounds.

In live cash games where the acting dealer changes each turn, it is not uncommon for the players to agree that the dealer (or some other position relative to the button) provides the ante for each player. This simplifies betting, but causes minor inequities if other players come and go or miss their turn to deal. During such times, the player can be given a special button indicating the need to pay an ante to the pot (known as &quot;posting&quot;; see below) upon their return. Some cardrooms eliminate these inequities by always dealing all players into every hand whether they are present or not. In such cases casino staff (or neighboring players under staff supervision) will be expected to post antes and fold hands on behalf of absent players as necessary.

===Blinds ===
A blind bet or just blind is a forced bet placed into the pot by one or more players before the deal begins, in a way that simulates bets made during play. The most common use of blinds as a betting structure calls for two blinds: the player after the dealer blinds about half of what would be a normal bet, and the next player blinds what would be a whole bet. This two-blind structure, sometimes with antes, is the dominating structure of play for community card poker games such as Texas hold &#x27;em. Sometimes only one blind is used (often informally as a &quot;price of winning&quot; the previous hand), and sometimes three are used (this is sometimes seen in Omaha hold &#x27;em). In the case of three blinds (usually one quarter, one quarter, and half a normal bet amount), the first blind goes &quot;on the button&quot;, that is, is paid by the dealer.

A blind is usually a &quot;live bet&quot;; the amount paid as the blind is considered when figuring the bet to that player (the amount needed to call) during the first round. However, some situations, such as when a player was absent from the table during a hand in which they should have paid a blind, call for placing a &quot;dead blind&quot;; the blind does not count as a bet.

For example, in a $2–4 limit game, the first player to the dealer&#x27;s left (who, if not for the blinds, would be the first to act) posts a small blind of $1, and the next player in turn posts a big blind of $2. After the cards are dealt, play begins with the next player in turn (third from the dealer), who must either call $2, raise, or fold. When the betting returns to the player who blinded $1, they must equal the bet facing them (toward which they may count their $1), raise, or fold. If there have been no raises when action first gets to the big blind (that is, the bet amount facing them is just the amount of the big blind they posted), the big blind has the ability to raise or check. This right to raise (called the &quot;option&quot;) occurs only once. As with any raise, if their raise is now called by every player, the first betting round closes as usual.

Similarly to a missed ante, a missed blind due to the player&#x27;s temporary absence (e.g. for drinks or a restroom break) can be denoted by use of a special button. Upon the player&#x27;s return, they must pay the applicable blind to the pot for the next hand they will participate in. The need for this rule is eliminated in casinos that deal in absent players as described above. Also the rule is for temporary absences only; if a player leaves the table permanently, special rules govern the assigning of blinds and button (see next subsection).

In some fixed-limit and spread-limit games, especially if three blinds are used, the big blind amount may be less than the normal betting minimum. Players acting after a sub-minimum blind have the right to call the blind as it is, even though it is less than the amount they would be required to bet, or they may raise the amount needed to bring the current bet up to the normal minimum, called &quot;completing&quot; the bet. For example, a limit game with a $5 minimum bet on the first round might have blinds of $1 and $2. Players acting after the blind may either call the $2, or raise to $5. After the bet is raised to $5, the next raise must be to $10 in accordance with the normal limits.

====When a player in the blinds leaves the game====
When one or more players pays the small or big blinds for a hand, then after that hand permanently leaves the game (by &quot;busting out&quot; in a tournament or simply calling it a night at a public cardroom), an adjustment is required in the positioning of the blinds and the button. There are three common rule sets to determine this:

* Simplified: The dealer button moves to the next active player on the left, and the small and big blinds are paid by the first and second players remaining to the left. This is the easiest to track and always rotates the button, but results in &quot;missed blinds&quot;. For instance, a player &quot;under the gun&quot; when the player in the big blind busts out ends up paying the small blind; they have &quot;missed&quot; the big blind they would have paid had the leaving player remained in the game. Similarly, a player in the small blind who busts out means the player in the big blind gets the button, missing the small blind.
**In the special case of three players in a tournament being reduced to the two-player showdown, any leftover blinds from other rules are &quot;written off&quot; and the Simplified method is used, with the player &quot;on the button&quot; paying the small blind.
* Moving button: As in Simplified, the button moves to the left to the next active player, and the blinds move to the next two active players. However, any &quot;missed blinds&quot; are paid by the player whom they skipped as if they were due for the upcoming hand, with one blind paid per player, per hand, biggest blind first. Any blind a player misses on a given hand because a bigger blind was due will be paid by the player in the following hand. This is the most complex ruleset to implement, especially if multiple players leave, but it is the fairest method overall in terms of paying all due blinds and rotating last action.
* Dead button: Spots vacated by leaving players who would pay the small blind or get the button during the next hand remain open for the purposes of shifting blinds and button. Thus, the small blind may not be paid in the subsequent hand if the player due to pay the small blind has vacated the spot and, therefore, is considered &quot;dead&quot;. However, there is always a big blind even if the spot is vacated by the player who is due to pay the big blind; in such case, the player seated to the left of the vacated spot pays the big blind. When the dealer button moves to an empty seat, it also is considered &quot;dead&quot;, and the last active player before the empty seat retains the &quot;privilege of last action&quot; by default. While simple in tournament formats and the most equitable in terms of paying blinds as due and when normally expected, it can result in inequitable strategic situations regarding last action, and becomes harder to track if the table is &quot;open&quot; (players can come and go) as in a casino.

In tournaments, the &quot;dead button&quot; and &quot;moving button&quot; rules are common (replacement players are generally not a part of tournaments). Online cash games generally use the &quot;simplified moving button&quot; as other methods are more difficult to codify and can be abused by players constantly entering and leaving.

Casino card rooms where players can come and go can use any of the three rulesets, though &quot;moving button&quot; is most common. When a player immediately takes the place of a player who leaves, the player may have the option to either pay the blinds in the leaving player&#x27;s stead, in which case play continues as if the player never left, or to &quot;sit out&quot; until the button has moved past them, and thus the chair is effectively empty for purposes of the blinds. Many card rooms do not allow new players to sit out as it is highly advantageous for the new player, both to watch one or more hands without obligation to play, and to enter the game in a very &quot;late&quot; position (on their first hand they see all other player&#x27;s actions except the dealer&#x27;s). For these reasons, new players must often post a &quot;live&quot; big blind to enter regardless of their position at the table.

====When there are only two players====
The normal rules for positioning the blinds do not apply when there are only two players at the table. The player on the button is always due the small blind, and the other player must pay the big blind. The player on the button is therefore the first to act before the flop, but last to act for all remaining betting rounds.

A special rule is also applied for placement of the button whenever the size of the table shrinks to two players. If three or more players are involved in a hand, and at the conclusion of the hand one or more players have busted out such that only two players remain for the next hand, the position of the button may need to be adjusted to begin heads-up play. The big blind always continues moving, and then the button is positioned accordingly.

For example, in a three-handed game, Alice is the button, Dianne is the small blind, and Carol is the big blind. If Alice busts out, the next hand Dianne will be the big blind, and the button will skip past Dianne and move to Carol. On the other hand, if Carol busts out, Alice will be the big blind, Dianne will get the button and will have to pay the small blind for the second hand in a row.

===Kill blind===

A kill blind is a special blind bet made by a player who triggers the kill in a &quot;kill game&quot;. It is often twice the amount of the big blind or minimum bet (known as a full kill), but can be 1.5 times the big blind (a half-kill) or any other amount according to house rules. This blind is &quot;live&quot;; the player posting it normally acts last in the opening round (after the other blinds, regardless of relative position at the table), and other players must call the amount of the kill blind to play. As any player can trigger a kill, there is the possibility that the player must post a kill blind when they are already due to pay one of the other blinds. Rules vary on how this is handled.

===Bring-in===
A bring-in is a type of forced bet that occurs after the cards are initially dealt, but before any other action. One player, usually chosen by the value of cards dealt face up on the initial deal, is forced to open the betting by some small amount, after which players act after them in normal rotation. Because of this random first action, bring-ins are usually used in games with an ante instead of structured blind bets.

The bring-in is normally assigned on the first betting round of a stud poker game to the player whose upcards indicate the poorest hand. For example, in traditional high hand stud games and high-low split games, the player showing the lowest card pays the bring-in. In low hand games, the player with the highest card showing pays the bring-in. The high card by suit order can be used to break ties, but more often the person closest to the dealer in order of rotation pays the bring-in.

In most fixed-limit and some spread-limit games, the bring-in amount is less than the normal betting minimum (often half of this minimum). The player forced to pay the bring-in may choose either to pay only what is required (in which case it functions similarly to a small blind) or to make a normal bet. Players acting after a sub-minimum bring-in have the right to call the bring-in as it is, even though it is less than the amount they would be required to bet, or they may raise the amount needed to bring the current bet up to the normal minimum, called completing the bet. For example, a game with a $5 fixed bet on the first round might have a bring-in of $2. Players acting after the bring-in can either call the $2, or increase it to $5, which would count as a normal bet, not a raise. After the bet is completed to $5, the first raise must be to $10 in accordance with the normal limits.

In a game where the bring-in is equal to the fixed bet (this is rare and not recommended), the game must either allow the bring-in player to optionally come in for a raise, or else the bring-in must be treated as live in the same way as a blind, so that the player is guaranteed their right to raise on the first betting round (the &quot;option&quot;) if all other players call.

===Post===
Some cash games, especially with blinds, require a new player to post when joining a game already in progress. Posting in this context means putting an amount equal to the big blind or the minimum bet into the pot before the deal. This amount is also called a &quot;dead blind&quot;. The post is a &quot;live&quot; bet, meaning that the amount can be applied towards a call or raise when it is the player&#x27;s turn to act. If the player is not facing a raise when the action gets to them, they may also &quot;check their option&quot; as if they were in the big blind.

A player who is away from their seat and misses one or more blinds is also required to post to reenter the game. In this case, the amount to be posted is the amount of the big or small blind, or both, at the time the player missed them. If both must be posted immediately upon return, the big blind amount is &quot;live&quot;, but the small blind amount is &quot;dead&quot;, meaning that it cannot be considered in determining a call or raise amount by that player. Some house rules allow posting one blind per hand, largest first, meaning all posts of missed blinds are live.

Posting is usually not required if the player who would otherwise post happens to be in the big blind. This is because the advantage that would otherwise be gained by missing the blind, that of playing several hands before having to pay blinds, is not the case in this situation. It is therefore common for a new player to lock up a seat and then wait several hands before joining a table, or for a returning player to sit out several hands until the big blind comes back around, so that they may enter in the big blind and avoid paying the post. For this same reason, only one set of missed blinds can be accumulated by the player; old missed blinds are removed when the big blind returns to that player&#x27;s seat because the player was never in any position to gain from missing the blinds.

In online poker it is common for the post to be equal in size to a big blind and to be live, just like the big blind. This can create a tactical advantage for the player if they choose not to play during the time they would otherwise spend in the blind in full ring games.

==Straddle and sleeper bets==
A &quot;straddle bet&quot; is an optional and voluntary blind bet made by a player after the posting of the small and big blinds, but before cards are dealt. Straddles are typically used only in cash games played with fixed blind structures. Some jurisdictions and casinos prohibit live straddles. Straddles are normally not permitted in tournament formats and are rarely allowed online.

The purpose of a straddle is to &quot;buy&quot; the privilege of last action, which on the first round with blinds is normally the player in the big blind. A straddle or sleeper blind may count as a raise towards the maximum number of raises allowed, or it may count separately; in the latter case this raises the maximum total bet of the first round. For example, straddling is permitted in Nevada and Atlantic City but illegal in other areas on account of differences in state and local laws.

===Live straddle===
The player immediately to the left of the big blind (&quot;under the gun&quot;, UTG) may place a &quot;live straddle&quot; blind bet. The straddle must be the size of a normal raise over the big blind. A straddle is a live bet; but does not become a &quot;bigger blind&quot;. The straddle acts as a minimum raise but with the difference being that the straddler still gets their option of acting when the action returns to them. In a no-limit game if any other player wants to make a raise with a straddle on board, the minimum raise will be the difference between the big blind and the straddle.

Example: small blind is at 5, big blind is 10 then a straddle would cost 20. The minimum raise would be 10, for a total of 30; it doesn&#x27;t need to double to 40.

Action begins with the player to the left of the straddle. If action returns to the straddle without a raise, the straddle has the option to raise. (This is part of what makes a straddle different from a &quot;sleeper&quot; because a sleeper does not have the option to raise if everyone folds or calls around to him.) Some casinos permit the player to the left of a live straddle to &quot;re-straddle&quot; by placing a blind bet raising the original straddle. Most public cardrooms do not permit more than one re-straddle. Depending on house rules, each re-straddle is often required to be double the previous straddle, so as to limit the number of feasible re-straddles.

Straddling is considered poor long-term strategy by most experts, since the benefit of obtaining last action is more than offset by the cost of making a blind raise. Because straddling has a tendency to enrich the average pot size without a corresponding increase in the blinds (and antes if applicable), players who sit at tables that allow straddling can increase their profits considerably simply by choosing not to straddle themselves.

====Mandatory straddles====
Straddling is voluntary at most cardrooms that allow it, however house rules can make straddling obligatory at times by using a special token (called &quot;the rock&quot;) at the table. Whoever is in possession of the &quot;rock&quot; is obliged to place a live straddle for double the big blind when they are in the UTG position. The winner of the ensuing pot takes possession of the &quot;rock&quot; and is obliged to make a live straddle when the UTG position comes around to this player. If the pot is split the &quot;rock&quot; goes to the winner closest to the left (i.e. clockwise) of the previous holder. This is very similar in principle to the &quot;kill blind&quot; of a kill game, but does not necessarily occur in the same circumstances, and the betting amounts do not have to be affected beyond the first round as in a kill game.

===Mississippi straddle===
A &quot;Mississippi straddle&quot; is similar to a live straddle, but instead of being made by the player &quot;under the gun&quot;, it can be made by any player, depending on house rules (one common variation is to allow this left of big blind or on the button). House rules permitting Mississippi straddles are common in the southern United States. Like a live straddle, a Mississippi straddle must be at least the minimum raise. Action begins with the player to the left of the straddle (in a common variation, action starts left of the big blind, skips over the straddle who is last). If, for example (in a game with $10–25 blinds), the button puts a live $50 on it, the first player to act would be the small blind, followed by the big blind, and so on. If action gets back to the straddle the straddle has the option of raising. The player to the left of a Mississippi straddle may re-straddle by placing a blind bet raising the original straddle.

===Sleepers===
A &quot;sleeper&quot; is a blind raise, made from a position other than the player &quot;under the gun&quot;. A Mississippi straddle is a sleeper raise given this definition, but Mississippi straddles can be disallowed or restricted while sleepers are allowed at any position. A sleeper bet is not given the option to raise if other players call, and the player is not buying last action; thus the sleeper bet simply establishes a higher minimum to call for the table during the opening round and allows the player to ignore their turn as long as no one re-raises the sleeper bet.

Sleepers are often considered illegal out-of-turn play and are commonly disallowed, but they can speed up a game slightly as a player who posts a sleeper can focus their attention on other matters such as ordering a drink or buying a tray of chips. It can also be an intimidation tactic as a sleeper raise makes it unfeasible to &quot;limp in&quot; (a situation where a player with a mediocre starting hand but acting late only has to call the minimum to see more cards), thus forcing weaker but improvable starting hands out of the play.

===Examples===
A game of no-limit poker with blinds of $1/$2. Alice is in the small blind, Dianne is in the big blind, Carol is next to act, followed by Joane, with Ellen on the button.

*Straddle: Alice posts $1, Dianne posts $2, Carol posts a straddle of $4. The hole cards are dealt. Because of the straddle, Joane is now first to act; she folds. Ellen calls the straddle. Alice folds. Dianne, the big blind, calls the straddle by putting an additional $2 in the pot. Carol has the option of checking or raising; she makes a raise of $8. Ellen folds. Dianne calls the raise, ending betting on this round.
*Mississippi straddle: Alice posts $1, Dianne posts $2, Ellen, on the button, posts a Mississippi straddle of $4. Because of the straddle, Alice, the small blind, is now first to act; she folds. Dianne calls the straddle by putting an additional $2 in the pot. Carol folds. Joane calls the straddle. Ellen has the option of checking or raising; she checks, ending betting on this round.
*Sleeper: Alice posts $1, Dianne posts $2, and Joane posts a sleeper blind of $4. The hole cards are dealt. Carol acts first as last action remains with the big blind, but the bet to her is $4. She calls. There is no additional bet to Joane and she has no option, so play passes over her to Ellen. She calls the $4 as well. Alice folds. Dianne, in the big blind, no longer has the option either; she must either call $2, raise, or fold. She raises by $4 (total bet is now $8). Carol re-raises to $12. The bet is now $8 to Joane, who must now call, raise or fold; she calls, as do Ellen and Dianne, ending the betting round.

==Limits==
Betting limits apply to the amount a player may open or raise, and come in four common forms: &quot;no limit&quot;, &quot;pot limit&quot; (the two collectively called big bet poker), &quot;fixed limit&quot;, and &quot;spread limit&quot;.

All such games have a minimum bet as well as the stated maximums, and also commonly a betting unit, which is the smallest denomination in which bets can be made. For example, it is common for games with $20 and $40 betting limits to have a minimum betting unit of $5, so that all bets must be in multiples of $5, to simplify game play. It is also common for some games to have a bring-in that is less than the minimum for other bets. In this case, players may either call the bring-in, or raise to the full amount of a normal bet, called completing the bet.

===Fixed limit===
In a game played with a fixed-limit betting structure, a player chooses only whether to bet or not—the amount is fixed by rule in most situations. To enable the possibility of bluffing and protection, the fixed amount generally doubles at some point in the game. This double wager amount is referred to as a big bet.

For example, a four-round game called &quot;20 and 40 limit&quot; (usually written as $20/$40) may specify that each bet in the first two rounds is $20, and that each &quot;big bet&quot; used in the third and fourth rounds is $40. This amount applies to each raise, not the total amount bet in a round, so a player may bet $20, be raised by $20, and then re-raise by another $20, for a total bet of $60, in such a game.

Some limit games have rules for specific situations allowing a player to choose between a small or big bet. For example, in seven-card stud high, when a player has a face-up pair on the second round (4th street), players may choose a small or big bet (e.g. $20 or $40 in a 20–40 game).

====Maximum number of raises====
Most fixed-limit games will not allow more than a predefined number of raises in a betting round. The maximum number of raises depends on the casino house rules, and is usually posted conspicuously in the card room. Typically, an initial bet plus either three or four raises are allowed.

Consider this example in a $20/$40 game, with a posted limit of a bet and three raises. During a $20 round with three players, play could proceed as follows:
:* Player A bets $20.
:* Player B puts in another bet, raises another $20, making it $40 to play.
:* Player C puts in a third bet, raising another $20 on that, thus making it $60 to play.
:* Player A puts in the fourth bet (they are usually said to cap the betting).

Once Player A has made their final bet, Players B and C may only call another two and one bets (respectively); they may not raise again because the betting is capped.

A common exception in this rule practiced in some card rooms is to allow unlimited raising when a pot is played heads up (when only two players are in the hand at the start of the betting round). Usually, this has occurred because all other players have folded, and only two remain, although it is also practiced when only two players get dealt in. Many card rooms will permit these two players to continue re-raising each other until one player is all in.

====Kill game====

Sometimes a fixed-limit game is played as a kill game. In such a game, a kill hand is triggered when a player wins a pot over a certain predetermined amount, or when the player wins a certain number of consecutive hands. The player triggering the kill must post a kill blind, generally either 1.5 times (a half kill) or double (a full kill) the amount of the big blind. In addition, the betting limits for the kill hand are multiplied by 1.5 or doubled, respectively.

The term kill, when used in this context, should not be confused with &quot;killing a hand&quot;, which is a term used for a hand that was made a dead hand by action of a game official.

===Spread limit===
A game played with a spread-limit betting structure allows a player to raise any amount within a specified range. For example, a game called &quot;one to five limit&quot; allows each bet to be anywhere from $1 to $5 (subject to other betting rules). These limits are typically larger in later rounds of multi-round games. For example, a game might be &quot;one to five, ten on the end&quot;, meaning that early betting rounds allow bets of $1 to $5, and the last betting round allows bets of $1 to $10.
Playing spread-limit requires some care to avoid giving easy tells with one&#x27;s choice of bets. Beginners frequently give themselves away by betting high with strong hands and low with weak ones, for instance. It is also harder to force other players out with big bets.

There is a variation of this known as &quot;California Spread,&quot; where the range is much higher, such as 3–100 or 10–1000. California Spread, as the name implies, is played in California, Colorado, and Minnesota, where local laws forbid no limit.

===Half-pot limit===
In a half-pot limit game, no player can raise more than the half of the size of the total pot. Half-pot limit games are often played at non-high-low games including Badugi in South Korea.

===Pot limit===

In a pot-limit game no player can raise more than the size of the total pot, which includes:
# Chips collected from previous betting rounds (Starting pot)
# Previous action in the current betting round (Trail)
# A call from the player making the raise
This does not preclude a player from raising less than the maximum so long as the amount of the raise is equal to or greater than any previous bet or raise in the same betting round.

Making a maximum raise is referred to as &quot;raising the pot&quot;, or &quot;potting&quot;, and can be announced by the acting player by declaring &quot;Raise pot&quot;, or simply &quot;Pot&quot;.

If there is $20 in the pot at the start of a betting round in a $2/$5 pot limit game, and Player A bets $5, player B may &quot;raise the pot&quot; and wager $35 creating a new pot total of $60. This is derived from the $20 previous round action, Player A&#x27;s $5 bet, Player B&#x27;s $5 call, and player B&#x27;s $30 Pot Raise ($20+$5+$5+$30=$60). Bear in mind, however, that $60 is the &quot;new&quot; pot, player B&#x27;s &quot;Pot&quot; declaration will cost them $35. (These actions, with additional follow-up wagering, are laid out in Table &#x27;1&#x27; on the right.)

Only pot limit games allow the dealer, on request, to inform the players of the pot size and the amount of a pot raise before it&#x27;s made. The dealer is also required to push any amount over the maximum raise back to the offending player. Keeping track of those numbers can be harrowing if the action becomes heated, but there are simple calculations that allow a dealer or player to keep track of the maximum raise amount. Here is an example:
:::(3L+T)+S=M
::where:
:::L=last wager T=trail(action prior to previous bet) S=starting pot(previous round action) and M=maximum bet
Going to player D&#x27;s actions in TABLE 1 on the right:
::The last wager made was made by Player C ($35), so L=$35
::The trail is the total of Player A+Player B ($5+$35), so T=$40
::The starting pot is $20, so S=$20
::The value of M(maximum bet) is $165
:::(35*3)+40+20=$165
After some practice, it is not difficult to keep up with the action at the table.

There may be some variance between cash and tournament play in pot limit betting structures, which should be noted:
* At some cash tables, it may &quot;not&quot; be a requirement that the dealer immediately return the extra amount of an overbet. If the over bet is not contested by a player before any additional action, the wager stands. If the overbet is contested, the dealer must know the overage amount, and return it to the offending player. This is something to find out before sitting at the table.
*Tournaments use a &quot;True Pot&quot; method of calculations, where the first round maximum raise to the first acting player is seven times the small blind. The blinds in a cash game, however, may not be a half and full bet (e.g. $2/$5) making the calculations run awry. In these cases a modification known as &quot;Assumed Call&quot; is used. Using an assumed call, the maximum raise to the first acting player in the first round is four times the &quot;big&quot; blind. Simply enough, the pot is treated as if the small blind had called, even if that player folded, to keep the pot&#x27;s math more manageable.
Because the calculations can be confusing, especially as tournament blind levels increase, major tournaments will include the amount of the small blind, big blind, minimum raise and maximum raise with the printed blind schedule and/or display them on the tournament timer.

There can be some confusion about the small blind. Some (usually home) games treat the small blind as dead money that is pulled into the center pot. In a $10/$25 pot limit game, the small blind puts $10 into the pot before the cards are dealt. Using the dead money reasoning, the small blind would put another $25 into the pot to call the big blind, for a total of $35. The big blind might then check for $25, which would enable that player to win out of proportion to their wager.

This is not equitable; it&#x27;s simple enough to consider that the small blind has made a half bet and must complete that bet for $15 to call, or raise, or fold for $10.

===No limit===
A game played with a no-limit betting structure allows each player to raise the bet by any amount up to and including their entire remaining stack at any time (subject to the table stakes rules and any other rules about raising). There is generally a minimum opening bet, and raises usually must be at least the amount of the previous raise.

===Cap limit===
Hands in a cap limit or &quot;capped&quot; structure are played exactly the same as in regular no limit or pot limit games until a pre-determined maximum per player is reached. Once the betting cap is reached, all players left in the hand are considered all-in, and the remaining cards dealt out with no more wagering.

For example, in a $1/$2 NL ($60 cap):

&quot;Player A bets $2. Player B raises to $10. Player C can then raise to a max of $60, and players A &amp; B can call the $60 wager ($58 and $50 respectively). There would be no further wagering, and the winner would collect $180.&quot;

Cap limit games offer a similar action and strategy to no limit and pot limit games, but without risking an entire stack on a single hand.

==Table stakes rules==
All casinos and most home games play poker by what are called table stakes rules, which state that each player starts each deal with a certain stake, and plays that deal with that stake. A player may not remove money from the table or add money from their pocket during the play of a hand. In essence, table stakes rules creates a maximum and a minimum buy-in amount for cash game poker as well as rules for adding and removing the stake from play. A player also may not take a portion of their money or stake off the table, unless they opt to leave the game and remove their entire stake from play. Players are not allowed to hide or misrepresent the amount of their stake from other players and must truthfully disclose the amount when asked.

In casino games, an exception is customarily made for de minimis amounts such as tips paid out of a player&#x27;s stack.

Common among inexperienced players is the act of &quot;going south&quot; after winning a big pot, which is to take a portion of one&#x27;s stake out of play, often as an attempt to hedge one&#x27;s risk after a win. This is also known as &quot;ratholing&quot; or &quot;reducing&quot; and, while totally permissible in most other casino games, is not permitted in poker. If a player wishes to &quot;hedge&quot; after a win, the player must leave the table entirely—to do so immediately after winning a large pot is known as a &quot;hit and run&quot; and, although not prohibited, is generally considered in poor taste as the other players have no chance to &quot;win some of it back&quot;.

In most casinos, once a player picks up their stack and leaves a table, they must wait a certain amount of time (usually an hour) before returning to a table with the same game and limits unless they buy in for the entire amount they left with. This is to prevent circumvention of the rule against &quot;ratholing&quot; by leaving the table after a large win only to immediately buy back in for a lesser amount.

Table stakes are the rule in most cash poker games because it allows players with vastly different bankrolls a reasonable amount of protection when playing with one another. They are usually set in relation to the blinds. For example, in a $1/2 No Limit cash game, the minimum stake is often set at $40 while maximum stake is often set at $200, or 20 and 100 big blinds respectively.

This also requires some special rules to handle the case when a player is faced with a bet that they cannot call with their available stake. In fixed-limit and spread-limit games, most casinos limit the number of raises per betting round. For example, a casino might limit raises to three or four, not including the opening bet. 

===&quot;All-in&quot; ===
A player faced with a current bet who wishes to call but has insufficient remaining stake (folding does not require special rules) may bet the remainder of their stake and declare themselves all-in. They may now hold onto their cards for the remainder of the deal as if they had called every bet, but may not win any more money from any player above the amount of their bet. In no-limit games, a player may also go all in, that is, betting their entire stack at any point during a betting round.

====Side pots====
A player who goes &quot;all-in&quot; effectively caps the main pot; the player is not entitled to win any amount from each player over their total stake. If only one other player is still in the hand, the other player simply matches the all-in (retracting any overage if necessary) and the hand is dealt to completion. However, if multiple players remain in the game and the bet rises beyond the all-in&#x27;s stake, the overage goes into a side pot. Only the players who have contributed to the side pot have the chance to win it. In the case of multiple all-in bets, multiple side pots can be created. Players who choose to fold rather than match bets &quot;in the side pot&quot; are considered to fold with respect to the main pot as well.

For example, with three players in a game, Player A, with a large stack, opens the betting round for $20. Player B only has $10. They call the $10, going all-in. Player C has $30, and thus can either call the full $20, re-raise to $30, or fold. Player C decides to &quot;raise all-in&quot;, betting their remaining stake. The bet is now $10 to Player A, who calls. Player A is the only player at the table with a remaining stake; they may not make any further bets this hand. Because Player B can only win $10 from each of the other two players&#x27; $30 bets, that $10 is taken from all players&#x27; bets and the $30 total is placed in the main pot. The $40 remaining, for which Players A and C are separately contesting, goes in a side pot. As no further bets can be made, the hand is now dealt to completion. It is found that Player B has the best hand overall, and wins the main pot. Player A has the second-best hand, and wins the side pot. Player C loses the hand, and must &quot;re-buy&quot; if they wish to be dealt in on subsequent hands.

There is a strategic advantage to being all-in: such a player cannot be bluffed, because they are entitled to hold their cards and see the showdown without risking any more money. Opponents who continue to bet after a player is all-in can still bluff each other out of the side pot, which is also to the all-in player&#x27;s advantage since players who fold out of the side pot also reduce competition for the main pot. But these advantages are offset by the disadvantage that a player cannot win any more money than their stake can cover when they have the best hand, nor can an all-in player bluff other players on subsequent betting rounds when they do not have the best hand.

Some players may choose to buy into games with a &quot;short stack&quot;, a stack of chips that is relatively small for the stakes being played, with the intention of going all-in after the flop and not having to make any further decisions. However, this is generally a non-optimal strategy in the long term, since the player does not maximize their gains on their winning hands.

====All-in before the deal====
If a player does not have sufficient money to cover the ante and blinds due, that player is automatically all-in for the coming hand. Any money the player holds must be applied to the ante first, and if the full ante is covered, the remaining money is applied towards the blind.

Some cardrooms require players in the big blind position to have at least enough chips to cover the small blind (and ante if applicable) in order to be dealt in. In cash games with such a rule, any player in the big blind with insufficient chips to cover the small blind will not be dealt in unless they re-buy. In tournaments with such a rule, any player in the big blind with insufficient chips to cover the small blind will be eliminated with their remaining chips being removed from play.

If a player is all in for part of the ante, or the exact amount of the ante, an equal amount of every other player&#x27;s ante is placed in the main pot, with any remaining fraction of the ante and all blinds and further bets in the side pot.

If a player is all in for part of a blind, all antes go into the main pot. Players to act must call the complete amount of the big blind to call, even if the all-in player has posted less than a full big blind. At the end of the betting round, the bets and calls will be divided into the main pot and side pot as usual.

For example, Alice is playing at a table with 10 players in a tournament with an ante of $1 and blinds of $4/$8. Alice is due the big blind but she only has $8. She must pay the $1 ante and apply the remaining $7 towards the big blind, and she is all in. Dianne, next to act, calls $8, the full big blind amount. Carol raises to $16 total. All remaining players fold, the small blind folds, and Dianne folds. The amount in the main pot is $10 (the sum of all antes) plus the full $4 small blind since Alice had this amount covered, plus $7 from Alice and every other player who called at least that amount, namely Dianne and Carol. The main pot is therefore $10 + $4 + 3 × $7 = $35. The side pot of $10 ($1 in excess of Alice&#x27;s all-in bet from Dianne, and $9 in excess of Alice&#x27;s all-in bet from Carol) is paid immediately to Carol when Dianne folds.

====Incomplete bet or raise====
If a player goes all-in with a bet or raise rather than a call, another special rule comes into play. There are two options in common use: pot-limit and no-limit games usually use what is called the full bet rule, while fixed-limit and spread-limit games may use either the full bet rule or the half bet rule. The full bet rule states that if the amount of an all-in bet is less than the minimum bet, or if the amount of an all-in raise is less than the full amount of the previous raise, it does not constitute a &quot;real&quot; raise, and therefore does &quot;not&quot; reopen the betting action. The half bet rule states that if an all-in bet or raise is equal to or larger than half the minimum amount, it &quot;does&quot; constitute a raise and reopens the action.

For example, with the full bet rule in effect, a player opens the betting round for $20, and the next player has a total stake of $30. They may raise to $30, declaring themselves all-in, but this does not constitute a &quot;real&quot; raise, in the following sense: if a third player now calls the $30, and the first player&#x27;s turn to act comes up, they may now call the additional $10, but they do not have the right to re-raise further. The all-in player&#x27;s pseudo-raise was really just a call with some extra money, and the third player&#x27;s call was just a call, so the initial opener&#x27;s bet was simply called by both remaining players, closing the betting round (even though they must still equalize the money by putting in the additional $10). If the half bet rule were being used, then that raise would count as a genuine raise and the first player would be entitled to re-raise if they chose to (creating a side pot for the amount of their re-raise and the third player&#x27;s call, if any).

In a game with a half bet rule, a player may complete an incomplete raise, if that player still has the right to raise (in other words, if that player has not yet acted in the betting round, or has not yet acted since the last full bet or raise). The act of completing a bet or raise reopens the betting to other remaining opponents.

For example, four players are in a hand, playing with a limit betting structure and a half bet rule. The current betting round is $20. Alice checks, and Dianne checks. Carol goes all-in for $5. Joane, still to act, has the following options: fold, call $5, or complete the bet to a total of $20. If Joane calls the $5, Alice and Dianne only have the option of calling or folding; neither can raise. But if Joane completes, either of them could raise.

====Opening all-in hands====
When all players in the pot are all-in, or one player is playing alone against opponents who are all all-in, no more betting can take place. Some casinos and many major tournaments require that all players still involved open, or immediately reveal, their hole cards in this case—the dealer will not continue dealing until all hands are flipped up. Likewise, any other cards that would normally be dealt face down, such as the final card in seven-card stud, may be dealt face-up. Such action is automatic in online poker. This rule discourages a form of tournament collusion called &quot;chip dumping&quot;, in which one player deliberately loses their chips to another to give that player a greater chance of winning.

==Open stakes==
The alternative to table stakes rules is called &quot;open stakes&quot;, in which players are allowed to buy more chips during the hand and even to borrow money (often called &quot;going light&quot;). Open stakes are most commonly found in home or private games. In casinos, players are sometimes allowed to buy chips at the table during a hand, but are never allowed to borrow money or use IOUs. Other casinos, depending on protocol for buying chips, prohibit it as it slows gameplay considerably.

Open stakes is the older form of stakes rules, and before &quot;all-in&quot; betting became commonplace, a large bankroll meant an unfair advantage; raising the bet beyond what a player could cover in cash gave the player only two options; buy a larger stake (borrowing if necessary) or fold. This is commonly seen in period-piece movies such as Westerns, where a player bets personal possessions or even wagers property against another player&#x27;s much larger cash bankroll.

In modern open-stakes rules, a player may go all in as in table stakes if they so choose, rather than adding to their stake or borrowing.
Because it is a strategic advantage to go all in with some hands while being able to add to one&#x27;s stake with others, such games may strictly enforce a minimum buy-in that is several times the maximum bet (or blinds, in the case of a no-limit or pot-limit game).
A player who goes all in and wins a pot that is less than the minimum buy-in may not then add to their stake or borrow money during any future hand until they re-buy an amount sufficient to bring their stake up to a full buy-in.

If a player cannot or does not wish to go all-in, they may instead choose to buy chips with cash out-of-pocket at any time, even during the play of a hand, and their bets are limited only by the specified betting structure of the game.

Finally, a player may also borrow money by betting with an IOU, called a &quot;marker&quot;, payable to the winner of the pot. To bet with a marker, &quot;all&quot; players still active in the pot must agree to accept the marker. Some clubs and house rules forbid IOUs altogether. If the marker is not acceptable, the bettor may bet with cash out-of-pocket or go all-in.
A player may also borrow money from a player not involved in the pot, giving them a personal marker in exchange for cash or chips, which the players in the pot are then compelled to accept.
A player may borrow money to call a bet during a hand, and later in the same hand go all-in due to further betting; but if a player borrows money to raise, they forfeit the right to go all-in later in that same hand—if they are re-raised, they &quot;must&quot; borrow money to call, or fold. 
A player may also buy more chips or be bought back in by any other player for any given amount at any given time.

Just as in table stakes, no player may remove chips or cash from the table once they are put in play (except small amounts for refreshments, tips, and such)—this includes all markers, whether one&#x27;s own or those won from other players.

Players may agree before play on the means and time limits of settling markers, and a convenient amount below which all markers must be accepted to simplify play.

<text>The card game of poker has many variations, most of which were created in the United States in the mid-1800s through the early 1900s. The standard order of play applies to most of these games, but to fully specify a poker game requires details about which hand values are used, the number of betting rounds, and exactly what cards are dealt and what other actions are taken between rounds.

==Popular poker variants==
The most popular poker variants can be divided into three broad groups:
* Draw poker: Games in which players are dealt a complete hand, hidden, and then improve it by replacing cards. The most common of these is five-card draw.
* Stud poker: Games in which each player receives a combination of face-up cards and face-down cards in multiple betting rounds. The most common of these are five-card stud and seven-card stud. These two variants are further played in other different formats.
* Community card poker: Games in which each player&#x27;s incomplete hidden hand is combined with shared face-up cards. The most common of these are Texas hold &#x27;em and Omaha hold &#x27;em.

Some common rule variations include:
*Wild cards are added. This can range from adding jokers as wild card, to making certain low cards such as deuces wild to the 7-card stud variant named baseball.
*Lowball: The lowest hand wins the pot. There are different rules about whether or not aces count as low, and the effects of straights and flushes. The most common variants are Razz and 2-7 Triple Draw
*High-low split: the highest and lowest hands split the pot. Generally there is a qualifier for the low hand. For example, the low hand must have 5 cards with ranks of 8 or less. In most high-low games the usual rank of poker hands is observed, so that an unsuited broken straight (7-5-4-3-2) wins low (see Morehead, Official Rules of Card Games). In a variant, based on Lowball, where only the low hand wins, a straight or a flush does not matter for a low hand. So the best low hand is 5-4-3-2-A, suited or not.
*Players can pass cards to each other. An example of this would be Anaconda.
*Kill game: When a fixed-limit game is played and some condition triggers the stakes to double. A common version is if the same player wins two or more games in a row.
*A twist round in which players can buy another card from the deck. If a player does not like the purchased card, the player can purchase another one by adding money to the pot. This is sometimes called a &quot;tittle.&quot;

===Mixed poker games===
Poker can be played in a mixed game format in which each variant will usually be played for a fixed number of hands or time and then the players will move on to the next game. There are many types of mixed poker games. The most notable mixed poker variation is HORSE poker, a mix of Texas hold &#x27;em, Omaha high-low, razz, seven-card stud and seven-card stud eight-or-better.

==Specific poker variant games==
Some poker games don&#x27;t fit neatly into the above categories, and some have features of more than one of these categories. These variants are most often played in home games, usually as part of a dealer&#x27;s choice format.

===High Chicago or Low Chicago===
Either of these two versions can be played in any stud high game. In High Chicago, or sometimes simply called Chicago, the player with the highest spade face down (referred to as &quot;in the hole&quot;) receives half the pot. In Low Chicago, the player with the lowest spade in the hole receives half of the pot, with the A♠ being the lowest. If the player with the highest hand also has the highest/lowest spade in the hole, then that player receives the entire pot - having won both sides of the bet.

===Follow the Queen===
This 7-card stud game uses a wild-card designated as whichever card is immediately dealt (exposed, or &quot;face-up&quot;) after any queen previously dealt (exposed). In the event that the final card dealt (exposed) is itself a queen, then all queens are wild. If no queens are dealt (exposed), then there are no wilds for that hand. Betting is the same as in normal 7-card stud games. Follow the Queen is a typical game variant in Dealer&#x27;s Choice poker games.

===Countdown===
A variant of 5-card draw with four rounds of betting. After the first round of betting, each player may choose to replace up to three cards. A second round of betting follows and then players may opt to replace up to two cards. Upon completing another round of betting, each player may replace one card of the cards in their hand. After a final round of betting, any remaining players show their hands, and the highest 5 card hand wins. When players draw cards to replace ones in their hand, they add the cost of the cards in the pot. The cost of cards doubles each round. For example, if the dealer says each replacement card costs $10 in the first round, then each card costs $20 in the second round, and $40 in the final round.

=== Guts ===

Guts is a family of games that are cousins of poker rather than poker variants. They usually involve hands of 3 or fewer cards, ranked similarly to hands in poker, and multiple successive rounds of betting each of which consist of the decision to be &quot;in&quot; or &quot;out&quot;, and each with its own showdown. The losers of rounds of guts generally match or double the pot, which grows rapidly.

=== Five-O poker ===

Five-O Poker is a heads-up poker variant in which both players must play five hands of five cards simultaneously. Four of the five cards in each hand are face-up. Once all five hands are down, there is a single round of betting. The winner is determined by matching each hand to the corresponding hand of the opponent. The player with the stronger poker hand in three (or more) out of the five columns, wins, unless a player folds on a bet that was made. If a player beats their opponent with all five hands, this is called a “Five-O” win.

===Chinese poker===

Chinese poker is a 2- to 4-player poker game with thirteen cards. The idea is to make three poker hands with increasing rank: two with five cards and one with three cards. If one of the hands does not adhere to increasing rank (i.e. is mis-set), the hand is declared dead and results in some sort of penalty.

===Kuhn poker===

Kuhn poker, using a three card deck, is more of a game theory problem than an actual game people play, but it can be played by two players.

<text>Five-card stud is the earliest form of the card game stud poker, originating during the American Civil War, but is less commonly played today than many other more popular poker games. It is still a popular game in parts of the world, especially in Finland where a specific variant of five-card stud called (also known as Canadian stud or Scandinavian stud) is played. The word is also used for checking in Finland (&quot;I check&quot; = ).

The description below assumes that one is familiar with the general game play of poker, and with hand values (both high and low variations). The description also makes no assumptions about what betting structure is used. Five-card stud is sometimes played no limit and pot limit, though fixed limit and spread limit games are common (with higher limits in the later betting rounds). It is typical to use a small ante and a bring-in.

==Description of play==
Play begins with each player being dealt one card face down, followed by one card face up (beginning, as usual, with the player to the dealer&#x27;s left). If played with a bring-in, the player with the lowest-ranking upcard must pay the bring-in, and betting proceeds after that. If two players have equally ranked low cards, suit rankings may be used to break the tie. If there is no bring-in, then the first betting round begins with the player showing the highest-ranking upcard, who may check. In this case, suit should not be used to break ties; if two players have the same high upcard, the one first in clockwise rotation from the dealer acts first.

After the first betting round is complete, another face-up card is dealt to each player (after a burn card, starting with the player to the dealer&#x27;s left, as with all subsequent rounds). Betting now begins with the player whose upcards make the best poker hand (since fewer than five cards are face up, this means no straights, flushes, or full houses). On this and subsequent betting rounds, the player to act first may check or bet up to the game&#x27;s limit. The second betting round is followed by a third upcard to each player and a third betting round, again starting with the player with the best poker hand showing (thus, the first player to act on each round may change). A fourth face-up card and fourth betting round is followed by a showdown, if necessary (it usually won&#x27;t be – most deals of five-card stud end early when a player bets and gets no calls).

===Example===
Assume that a game is being played by four players: Alice, who is dealing; Bob, who is sitting to her left; Carol to his left; David to Carol&#x27;s left. Alice deals one card face down to each player, followed by one card face up to each player, beginning with Bob and ending with herself. Bob is dealt the &#x27;, Carol the &#x27;, David the &#x27;, and Alice the &#x27;. Because they had earlier agreed to play with a $1 bring-in, David is required to start the betting with a $1 bring-in (his &#x27; is lower than Bob&#x27;s &#x27; by suit). He has the option to open the betting for more, but he chooses to bet only the required $1. The bring-in sets the current bet amount to $1, so Alice cannot check. She decides to call. Bob folds, indicating this by turning his upcard face down and discarding his cards. Carol raises to $3. David folds (forfeiting his bring-in), and Alice calls.

====Third street====
Alice now deals a second face-up card to each remaining player: Carol is dealt the &#x27;, and Alice the &#x27;. Alice&#x27;s two face-up cards make a poker hand of no pair, Q-9 high, and Carol has Q-J high, so it is Carol&#x27;s turn to bet. She checks, as does Alice, ending the betting round.

====Fourth street====
Another face-up card is dealt: Carol gets the &#x27;, and Alice gets the &#x27;. Alice now has a pair of queens showing, and Carol still has no pair, so Alice bets first. She bets $5, and Carol calls.

====Fifth Street====
The final card is dealt face up: Carol gets the &#x27; and Alice gets the &#x27;. Carol still only has no pair showing, thus resulting in Alice, with her pair of queens showing, set to start the betting. Alice bets $5 and is raised to $10 by Carol. Alice calls and the two must now enter into a showdown - where both players compare their best five-card poker hand. Since Carol was the last player to take aggressive action, she shows first - flipping over her hole card, the - thus giving her a pair of aces. Since she is the last to act, Alice is allowed to muck her cards and does so. Therefore, the pot of $37 goes to Carol.

==Popularity==
Since its popularity during the American Civil War, five-card stud has seen a gradual decline in its popularity. Despite this drop in status, it is still enjoyed by many players.

===Major tournaments===
Five-card stud was one of the preliminary events in the World Series of Poker in 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1974. All four of these events were won by Bill Boyd (he won a total of $80,000 from these four events) – the only WSOP bracelets he won. Due to the declining popularity of five-card stud, it was left out of the 1975 World Series of Poker and has been absent from all subsequent World Series of Poker schedules. Although five-card stud has not been featured in major tournaments since the 70s, it was occasionally still offered in the 1990s in both Europe and North America.

===Cash games===
Five-card stud was limited to small home games and small casino games until becoming available at some online poker cardrooms.

==Variants==
Traditional five-card stud involves one hole card with four cards face-up, making it simple for even a novice to read the possible hand strength of an opponent effectively. The transparency of a player&#x27;s hand cuts out much of the element of uncertainty found in more popular games like Texas hold &#x27;em, Omaha hold &#x27;em and Seven-card stud. In order to enlarge that element of uncertainty variants increase the number of hole cards, add a high-low split, play with a stripped deck, introduce a twist round, enable the player to do a &#x27;roll your own&#x27; game or even create new and interesting hand rankings.

===High-Low===
The game can be played with low hand values, in which case the best low hand showing starts each betting round instead of the best high hand showing. Also, the highest-ranking card must pay the bring-in if it is played with a bring-in. At the end of all betting rounds, the total pot is split into two - one for low-ranking hands, the other for high-ranking hands - and the hands are evaluated based on both low-ranking criteria (for the low pot) and high-ranking criteria (for the high pot). When playing High-Low it is common to use the Ace-to-five low hand ranking to evaluate the low hands and use the standard hand ranking when evaluating high hands. In the United Kingdom, however, the use of Ace-to-six low hand ranking is common when evaluating low hands.

===Canadian Stud/Scandinavian Stud/Sökö===
This variant of five-card stud is almost identical to the traditional format, the only difference being the introduction of two new hands into the hand ranking. Due to the sparse nature of flushes and straights in five-card stud, this variant counts four-card straights and four-card flushes as poker hands. A four-card straight is ranked higher than a pair, a four-card flush is ranked higher than a four-card straight, and a two-pair is ranked higher than a four-card flush.

===Two Down, Three up/2-3===
Instead of dealing the players one hole card and one upcard, in this variant the players are dealt two hole cards. All subsequent cards are dealt face up, resulting in the fairly self-explanatory name.

===Three Down, Two Up/3-2===
Instead of dealing the players one hole card and one upcard, in this variant players are dealt three cards face down. The next two cards are dealt face up. As a result of the high number of cards dealt initially, this variant only has 3 rounds of betting and is thus best played with no limit or pot limit betting structure. The name is again fairly self-explanatory.

===One Down, Three Up, One Down/1-3-1===
This variant differs from traditional five-card stud only in the way the final card is dealt. Rather than being face up, in this variant the river is dealt face down—as a hole card. The name, yet again, derives from how a hand looks after all betting rounds are done. This is also a common variant in Finland, where the action of players looking to their hole river card secretly from the others is called &quot;pihistäminen&quot;, (Engl. &quot;petty theft&quot;).

===Mexican stud/Stud Loco/Mexican poker===
Mexican stud is a roll your own game where the player receives five face-down cards, and has to reveal four of them. The player is dealt two cards (as in traditional five-card stud), and that he/she must expose one of them. The player then receives a third card, and must immediately expose another card in his/her hand. The player exposes another one after receiving a fourth card, and again after a fifth card. Sometimes a stripped deck is used. Mexican stud is also a variant of Seven-card stud, employing the same roll your own rules.

====Shifting sands====
This game&#x27;s only difference in relation to Mexican stud is that the player&#x27;s hole card, and all cards of that rank, are considered wild cards for that player only.

===Telesina/Teresina===
Telesina, with origins in Sanremo, is often described as a variant of five-card stud. The initial four rounds are identical to five-card stud, the players receiving two cards (one face down) and then 3 more face-up cards interspersed with betting rounds. However, a final round is added where all the players are dealt a single community card. The other main difference is the use of a stripped deck - with all cards of rank 2 to 6 inclusive taken out of the deck. As a result, this variant is often played shorthanded - usually with 6 players per table. As with most stripped deck games, in Telesina flushes are ranked above full-houses. In addition, unlike in traditional poker, suits are used to break ties. If players have an identical straight flush or straight, the high suit wins. If both players have the same pair or two pair, the suit of the highest kicker determines the winner. The order of suits, strongest to weakest, is hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades. Another unique rule states if two players have a flush the highest-ranking card is not used to determine a winner; instead, the Telesina suit order is used to resolve the situation. The final Telesina-specific rule states if there are only two players left in the pot, the highest straight flush (A, K, Q, J, T in hearts) is beaten by the lowest straight flush (T, 9, 8, 7, A in spades). Note that these rules are as the game has been played on several online poker sites, but Telesina may generically refer to any stripped deck five-card stud variation.

===Asian five-card stud / Americana===
Regular five-card stud played with a stripped deck - with all cards of rank 2 to 6 inclusive removed from the deck. This variant has been played in a tournament format in California. Called Americana, the game has been available on online poker sites. As with other stripped deck games, a flush is ranked higher than a full house. This is different from the game Asian stud which is played against the house.

<text>Seven-card stud, also known as Seven-Toed Pete or Down-The-River, is a variant of stud poker. Before the 2000s surge of popularity of Texas hold &#x27;em, seven-card stud was one of the most widely played poker variants in home games across the United States and in casinos in the eastern part of the country. Although seven-card stud is not as common in casinos today, it is still played online. The game is commonly played with two to eight players; however, eight may require special rules for the last cards dealt if no players fold. Playing with nine players is possible.

In casino play, it is common to use a small ante and bring-in. In home games, using only an ante is typical.

Seven-card stud is the &quot;S&quot; game in HORSE and similar mixed game formats.

== Rules ==
The Poker game begins with each player being dealt two cards face down and one card face up. The player with the lowest-ranking up-card pays the bring-in, and betting proceeds after that in normal clockwise order. The bring-in is considered an open, so the next player in turn may not check. If two players have equally ranked low cards, the card&#x27;s suit may be used to break the tie and assign the bring-in (see high card by suit). If there is no bring-in, then the first betting round begins with the player showing the highest-ranking up-card, who may check. In this case, suit is not used to break ties. If two players have the same high up-card, the one first in clockwise rotation from the dealer acts first.

After the first betting round, another up-card is dealt to each player (after a burn card, and starting at the dealer&#x27;s left as will all subsequent rounds), followed by a second betting round beginning with the player whose up-cards make the best poker hand. Since fewer than five cards are face up, this means no straights, flushes, or full houses will count for this purpose. On this and all subsequent betting rounds, the player whose face-up cards make the best poker hand will act first, and may check or bet up to the limit of the game.

The second round is followed by a third up-card and betting round, a fourth up-card and betting round, and finally a down-card, a fifth betting round, and showdown if necessary. Seven-card stud can be summarized therefore as &quot;two down, four up, one down&quot;. Upon showdown, each player makes the best five-card poker hand they can out of the seven cards they were dealt.

Seven cards to eight players with an additional four burn cards makes 60 cards, whereas there are only 52 in the deck: in most games, this is not a problem because several players will have folded in early betting rounds. In the event that the deck is exhausted during play, the four previously dealt burn cards can be used, but if these are not sufficient, then the final round will have a single community card (which can be used by everyone) dealt into the center of the table in lieu of a down-card to each player. Discarded cards from a folded hand are not reused.

Stud poker players use the information they get from face-up cards to make strategic decisions. A player who sees a certain card folded is able to make decisions knowing that the card will never appear in another opponent&#x27;s hand.

==Variants==

There are several variations of Seven-Card Stud Poker in which each player is dealt a set number of cards. Not all of these variations can be found at poker rooms but they can be played at home. 
# &quot;Down the River&quot; is the basic variation of Seven-Card Stud Poker and this is the game played in poker rooms. 
# &quot;Mississippi&quot; removes the betting round between fourth and fifth streets, making only four betting rounds. This game also deals the fourth and fifth cards face up. This makes the game more closely resemble Texas Hold&#x27;em by having the same betting structure and the same number of down and up cards.
# Another is &quot;roll your own&quot;, in which four rounds of two cards each are dealt down, and each player must &quot;roll&quot; one card to face up, followed by a round of betting. Except for the first round, the card rolled may or may not be from the round just dealt.
# &quot;Queens and after&quot;: in this variant, all Queens are wild, and so is whatever card that is dealt face up that follows the Queen. All cards of that kind are now wild, both showing and in the hole. The interesting part is that if another Queen is dealt face-up, the wild card will change to whatever follows this Queen. The former card is no longer wild.
# &quot;Baseball&quot;: in this variant 3s and 9s are wild, and a 4 dealt face up gets an extra card.
# &quot;Low Chicago&quot;: Low spade in the hole gets half the pot. Similarly, &quot;High Chicago&quot; means high spade instead of low. Just &quot;Chicago&quot; can mean either.
# &quot;Acey Ducey&quot;: aces and twos are wild.
# One-eyed Jacks or Suicide King can be specified as wild.
# Razz is a lowball form of Seven-Card Stud, with the objective being to get the lowest hand possible.
# In the variation called &quot;Seven-Card Stud High-Low&quot;, the pot is split between the holder of the highest and lowest hand if the low hand is topped by at least an 8. Alternative names to this variation are Seven-Card Stud/8 and Seven-Card Stud Split.

==Sample deal==

The sample deal below assumes that a game is being played by four players: Jimmy, who is dealing in the examples; Larry, who is sitting to his left; Craig to his left; and Katherine to Craig’s left.

All players ante 25¢. Jimmy deals each player two downcards and one upcard, beginning with Larry and ending with himself. Larry is dealt the 4♠, Craig the K♦, Katherine the 4♦, and Jimmy the 9♣. Because they are playing with a $1 bring-in, Katherine is required to start the betting with a $1 bring-in (her 4♦ is lower than 4♠ of Larry by suit). She had the option to open the betting for more, but she chose to bet only the required $1. The bring-in sets the current bet amount to $1, so Jimmy cannot check. He decides to call. Larry folds, indicating this by turning his upcard face down and discarding his cards. Craig raises to $3. Katherine folds, and Jimmy calls.

Jimmy now deals a second face-up card to each remaining player: Craig is dealt the J♣, and Jimmy the K♥. Jimmy’s two upcards make a poker hand of no pair, K-9-high, and Craig has K-J-high, so it is Craig&#x27;s turn to bet. He checks, as does Jimmy, ending the betting round.

Another face up card is dealt: Craig gets the 10♥ and Jimmy gets the K♣. Jimmy now has a pair of kings showing, and Craig still has no pair, so Jimmy bets first. He bets $5, and Craig calls.

On the next round, Craig receives the 10♦, making his upcards K-J-10-10. Jimmy receives the 3♠. Jimmy’s upcards are 9-K-K-3; the pair of kings is still higher than Craig’s pair of tens, so he bets $5 and Craig calls.

Each player now receives a downcard. It is still Jimmy’s turn to bet because the downcard did not change either hand. He checks, Craig bets $10, and Jimmy calls. That closes the last betting round, and both players remain, so there is a showdown.

Since Jimmy called Craig’s bet, Craig shows his cards first: Q♠ 2♥ K♦ J♣ 10♥ 10♦ A♦. He can play A-K-Q-J-10, making an ace-high straight. Jimmy shows (or, seeing he cannot beat Craig’s straight, mucks his cards): 9♥ 5♦ 9♣ K♥ K♣ 3♠ 5♠. The best five-card poker hand he can play is K-K-9-9-5, making two pair, kings and nines. Craig wins the pot.

== In popular culture ==
At the end of Tennessee Williams&#x27; play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, the minor character Steve says &quot;This game is seven-card stud,&quot; seemingly a reference to the narrative&#x27;s transactional, game-like nature and its lack of propensity to change.

<text>Testimony is a solemn attestation as to the truth of a matter.

==Etymology==
The words &quot;testimony&quot; and &quot;testify&quot; both derive from the Latin word &quot;testis&quot;, referring to the notion of a disinterested third-party witness.

==Law==

In the law, testimony is a form of evidence in which a witness makes a &quot;solemn declaration or affirmation ... for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact&quot;. According to Bryan A. Garner, the editor of &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;testimony&quot; is properly used as a mass noun (that is, always uninflected regardless of number), and not a count noun.

Testimony may be oral or written, and it is usually made by oath or affirmation under penalty of perjury. Historically, to be admissible in court and to ensure maximum reliability and validity, written testimony presented in the form of an affidavit (i.e., the witness would not be appearing in court at the hearing at which the affidavit was considered as evidence) was usually witnessed by another person (in many common law jurisdictions, a notary public) who had to also swear to or affirm its authenticity, also under penalty of perjury. In 1976, the United States Congress enacted a statute allowing for the use of an unsworn declaration under penalty of perjury in lieu of an affidavit in federal courts. In other words, the declarant&#x27;s signature together with a statement that they were making the unsworn declaration under penalty of perjury were deemed as a matter of law to be sufficiently solemn to remind the declarant of their duty to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (meaning notarization was no longer required). As of 2006, about 20 states also had similar statutes allowing the use of unsworn declarations in their state courts.

Unless a witness is testifying as an expert witness, testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is generally limited to those opinions or inferences that are rationally based on the perceptions of the witness and are helpful to a clear understanding of the witness&#x27; testimony.

Legitimate expert witnesses with a genuine understanding of legal process and the inherent dangers of false or misleading testimony refrain from making statements of fact. They also recognize that they are in fact not witnesses to an alleged crime or other event in any way, shape or form. Their expertise is in the examination of evidence or relevant facts in the case. They should make no firm judgement or claim or accusation about any aspect of the case outside their narrow range of expertise. They also should not allege any fact they can not immediately and credibly prove scientifically.
For example, a hair sample from a crime scene entered as evidence by the prosecution should be described by an expert witness as &quot;consistent with&quot; a sample collected from the defendant, rather than being described as a &quot;match&quot;. A wide range of factors make it physically impossible to prove for certain that two hair or tissue samples came from a common source.

Having not actually witnessed the defendant at the scene, the expert witness can not state for a fact that the sample is a match to the defendant, particularly when the samples were collected at different times and different places by different collectors using different collection methods. Ultimately, the testimony of expert witnesses is regarded as supportive of evidence rather than evidence in and of itself, and a good defense attorney will point out that the expert witness is not in fact a witness to anything, but rather an observer.

When a witness is asked a question, the opposing attorney can raise an objection, which is a legal move to disallow or prevent an improper question to others, preferably before the witness answers, and mentioning one of the standard reasons, including:
* argumentative
* asked and answered
* best evidence rule
* calls for speculation
* calls for a conclusion
* compound question or narrative
* hearsay
* inflammatory
* incompetent witness (e.g., child, mental or physical impairment, intoxicated)
* irrelevant, immaterial (the words &quot;irrelevant&quot; and &quot;immaterial&quot; have the same meaning under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Historically, irrelevant evidence referred to evidence that has no probative value, i.e., does not tend to prove any fact. Immaterial refers to evidence that is probative, but not as to any fact material to the case. See Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary, 7th Ed.).
* lack of foundation
* leading question
* privilege
* vague
* ultimate issue testimony
There may also be an objection to the answer, including:
* non-responsive

Up until the mid-20th century, in much of the United States, an attorney often had to follow an objection with an exception to preserve the issue for appeal. If an attorney failed to &quot;take an exception&quot; immediately after the court&#x27;s ruling on the objection, he waived his client&#x27;s right to appeal the issue. Exceptions have since been abolished, due to the widespread recognition that forcing lawyers to take them was a waste of time.

When a party uses the testimony of a witness to show proof, the opposing party often attempts to impeach the witness. This may be done using cross-examination, calling into question the witness&#x27;s competence, or by attacking the character or habit of the witness. So, for example, if a witness testifies that he remembers seeing a person at 2:00 pm on a Tuesday and his habit is to be at his desk job on Tuesday, then the opposing party would try to impeach his testimony related to that event.

== Government ==
Testimony is given by those invited or compelled to speak at, or submit a written statement to, legislative hearings such as United States congressional hearings.

Testimony may also be given to a regulatory agency as part of the process of making or changing regulations.

==Religion==
Christians in general, especially within the Evangelical tradition, use the term &quot;to testify&quot; or &quot;to give one&#x27;s testimony&quot; to mean &quot;to tell the story of how one became a Christian&quot;. Commonly it may refer to a specific event in a Christian&#x27;s life in which God did something deemed particularly worth sharing. Christians often give their testimony at their own baptism, church services, and at evangelistic events. Many Christians have also published their testimony on the internet.

===New Testament===
After the early church began to preach about the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, Peter and the other apostles asserted that &quot;we are witnesses of these things&quot;. Pope Francis has commented on Peter being &quot;strong in his testimony&quot;, describing &quot;testimony&quot; as the &quot;lifeblood&quot; of the church.

===Types===
Many Methodist churches in the holiness tradition devote a portion of their Sunday evening service and/or mid-week Wednesday evening service of worship to allow members to give a personal testimony about their faith and experiences in living the Christian life:
In the Religious Society of Friends, the word &quot;testimony&quot; is used to refer to the ways in which Friends &quot;testify&quot; or &quot;bear witness&quot; to their beliefs in their everyday lives. In this context, the word &quot;testimony&quot; refers not to the underlying belief, but the committed action which arises out of their beliefs, which &quot;testifies&quot; to their beliefs. Common areas in which modern Friends are said to testify include testimony towards peace, testimony to simplicity, testimony to truth and integrity, and testimony to equality.

 In some religions (most notably Mormonism and Islam) many adherents testify as a profession of their faith, often to a congregation of believers. In Mormonism, testifying is also referred to as &quot;bearing one&#x27;s testimony&quot;, and often involves the sharing of personal experience—ranging from a simple anecdote to an account of personal revelation—followed by a statement of belief that has been confirmed by this experience. Within Mormon culture, the word &quot;testimony&quot; has become synonymous with &quot;belief&quot;. Although &quot;testimony&quot; and &quot;belief&quot; are often used interchangeably, they are inherently different. Most Mormons believe that when faith is acted upon, individuals can receive a spiritual witness which solidifies belief into testimony; that if the exercise of faith leads to good works, they can know their religious principles are true. An individual who no longer believes in the religion may be referred to as having &quot;lost their testimony&quot;.

== Large-group awareness training ==
In the context of large-group awareness training, anecdotal testimony may operate in the forms of &quot;sharing&quot; or delivering a &quot;share&quot;.

==Literature==

Some published oral or written autobiographical narratives are considered &quot;testimonial literature&quot; particularly when they present evidence or first person accounts of human rights abuses, violence and war, and living under conditions of social oppression. This usage of the term comes originally from Latin America and the Spanish term &quot;testimonio&quot; when it emerged from human rights tribunals, truth commissions, and other international human rights instruments in countries such as Chile and Argentina. One of the most famous, though controversial, of these works to be translated into English is &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchú&quot;. The autobiographies of Frederick Douglass can be considered among the earliest significant English-language works in this genre. The biographies of marginalized women such as Jesusita Aragon and Maria Elena Lucas, made from recordings and transcriptions by oral historian Fran Leeper Buss, are more recent examples. 

==Philosophy==
In philosophy, testimony is a proposition conveyed by one entity (person or group) to another entity, whether through speech or writing or through facial expression, that is based on the entity&#x27;s knowledge base. The proposition believed on the basis of a testimony is justified if conditions are met which assess, among other things, the speaker&#x27;s reliability (whether her testimony is true often) and the hearer&#x27;s possession of positive reasons (for instance, that the speaker is unbiased).

We can also rationally accept a claim on the basis of another person&#x27;s testimony unless at least one of the following is found to be true:

# The claim is implausible;
# The person or the source in which the claim is quoted lacks credibility;
# The claim goes beyond what the person could know from his or her own experience and competence.
