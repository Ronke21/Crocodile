<text>In Greek mythology, Otrera ( &quot;Otrērē&quot;) was the founder and first Queen of the Amazons; the consort of Ares and mother of Hippolyta and Penthesilea. She is credited with being the founder of the shrine of Artemis in Ephesus.

== Mythology ==
=== Queen of the Amazons ===
Apollonius of Rhodes writes that the three cities of the Amazons are located in the plain of Doias. He further mentions a temple of Ares, Otrera and Antiope built in a desert island full of ravening birds.

Otrera is sometimes considered the mythological founder of the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, which was closely connected with Amazons. She is the queen and the founding mother of the Amazon nation.

Otrera was the consort of Ares and mother by him of Hippolyta and Penthesilea; both went on to become queens of the Amazons.

While usually said to be Ares&#x27; consort, in one version she&#x27;s his daughter instead by an unknown mother.

=== Otrera and the Temple of Artemis ===
The war-like Amazons were credited with founding the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. They established an image beneath an oak tree, with one of them, Hippolyta, performing the ritual in honour of the goddess, and around the image they broke into a war dance, holding their spears and armor. No one was to refuse the yearly dance, as Hippolyta apparently did and was punished for that.

Pausanias writes that, Pindar also followed the tradition in which the cult of Artemis in Ephesus was established by Otrera and the Amazons. According to Pindar, the sanctuary was founded by the Amazons during their campaign against Athens and Theseus, and that it was common for the women from Thermodon to sacrifice there on that occasion as well as other, such as when they fled from Heracles and earlier still from Dionysus. However, Pausanias notes that the cult of Artemis is much more ancient, and that it wasn&#x27;t the Amazons, but a native named Coresus who founded the temple.

=== Possible adventures ===
While she&#x27;s not confirmed by name in taking part in any of those events, it is recorded that once the Amazons took part in a campaign against Troy, and that the hero Bellerophon also led a war against them, in which he emerged victorious.

<doc id="78594" wikidata="Q379828" url="?curid=78594" title="Penthesilea">
<text>Penthesilea () was an Amazonian queen in Greek mythology, the daughter of Ares and Otrera and the sister of Hippolyta, Antiope, and Melanippe. She assisted Troy in the Trojan War, during which she was killed by Achilles or Neoptolemus. The asteroid 271 Penthesilea, discovered in 1887, was named in her honor.

== In the Epic Cycle ==

In the five book epic &quot;Aethiopis&quot;, which was part of the Epic Cycle (or Cycle of Troy) on the Trojan War, the coming to Troy of Penthesilea and Memnon was described in detail. The &quot;Aethiopis&quot; was published in the 8th century BC and is attributed to Arctinus of Miletus. The main character of the epic is Achilles, who fights Penthesilea and Memnon before he is himself killed. Although &quot;Aethiopis&quot; has been lost, the Epic Cycle has been adapted and recycled in different periods of the classical age. The tradition of retelling the epic fall of Troy is indebted to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which were grounded in oral storytelling and were only written down when the Greek alphabet was adopted in ancient Greece.

In the &quot;Aethiopis&quot; Penthesilea is a Thracian woman warrior. She was an Amazon and daughter of Ares, who comes to help the Trojans. She arrived with twelve other Amazon warriors. After a day of distinguishing herself on the battlefield, Penthesilea confronts Achilles and a fight ensues. Achilles kills her, and Thersites taunts Achilles by accusing him of having fallen in love with Penthesilea. Thersites is killed by Achilles after he punches Thersites so hard he dies, he then travels to the island of Lesbos to be purified before returning to Troy and fighting Memnon.

According to Homer, the Trojan king Priam had fought the Amazons in his youth on the Sangarius River in Phrygia, some 350 miles east of Troy. Later writers of the antiquity located Amazons geographically in Anatolia and started an epic tradition where Greek heroes, such as Heracles and Theseus, fought an Amazon warrior of distinction. The &quot;Aethiopis&quot; version of the Penthesilea legend has become known as the Homeric tradition.

=== Other traditions ===

Different traditions of the Penthesilea legend appear to have existed at the time the Epic Cycle was published. One myth states that it was Neoptolemus who killed Penthesilea, instead of Achilles. In a lost poem of Stesichorus, believed to have been published in the 7th or 6th century, Penthesilea rather than Achilles had killed Hector.

== Portrayal in antiquity ==

=== Literature ===

==== Pseudo-Apollodorus ====
In the Pseudo-Apollodorus &quot;Epitome of the Bibliotheke&quot; she is said to have been killed by Achilles, &quot;who fell in love with the Amazon after her death and slew Thersites for jeering at him&quot;.

==== Lycophron ====
In the 3rd century BC, Lycophron went against the grain of the Homeric tradition. The poet had been born in Euboea, the site of a shrine to wounded Amazons who had fought in a mythic Battle for Athens. Lycophron tells the story of the young Amazon Clete, Penthesilea&#x27;s attendant, who had been left behind in Pontus. Clete sets out with a company of Amazons to search for Penthesilea when she does not return from the Trojan War. The ship with Amazons is swept off course and after a shipwreck on the toe of Italy in Bruttium, Clete becomes the queen of the Amazons that settle there.

==== Virgil ====
In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, written between 29 and 19 BC, the Trojan army falls back when Achilles advances. Achilles drags the greatest Trojan warrior, Hector, around the city walls and sells his dead body to king Priam for gold. Penthesilea is cast as a tragic Amazon queen who came too late in vain to help the beleaguered city. When Aeneas sees the panel of Penthesilea in the Juno temple of Carthage, he knows that the defeat of Penthesilea and Memnon presage a chain of events that would culminate in the sacking of the city. Penthesilea&#x27;s fate also foreshadows that of Camilla, which is described in detail by Virgil later in the epic. According to Virgil, Penthesilea led an army of Amazons and is a &quot;bellatrix&quot; (Latin for &quot;female warrior&quot;) who dared to fight men (&quot;audetque viris concurrere virgo&quot;).

Virgil based his narrative in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, while relying on the Epic Cycle for his portrayal of Penthesilea. Virgil also reworked oral legends into an epic on the foundation of Rome. In &quot;Aeneid&quot; the Romans descended from the hero Aeneas and Trojan refugees who sailed to Italy after the Trojan War. This interweaving of the Penthesilea legend with the founding legend of Rome can be traced to Lycophron.

==== Diodorus ====
In his universal history &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;, Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC celebrated Penthesilea as the last Amazon to win renown for valour in war. Diodorus wrote that after the Trojan War the Amazons diminished and tales of their former glory began to be considered mere legends.

==== Smyrnaeus ====
In the 4th century AD, the imperial Greek poet Quintus Smyrnaeus made Penthesilea the subject of the first book in &quot;Posthomerica&quot;. In this epic, Smyrnaeus tries to finish Homer by telling the colourful story of how the city of Troy fell. This work explains how Penthesilea came to be at Troy: Penthesilea had killed Hippolyta with a spear when they were hunting deer; this accident caused Penthesilea so much grief that she wished only to die, but, as a warrior and an Amazon, she had to do so honorably and in battle. She therefore was easily convinced to join in the Trojan War. Smyrnaeus also describes in gory detail how the army of Amazons surprises the Greek army and the slaughter that commenced. The Amazon Klonie, after slaying her first opponent, is in turn killed. Penthesilea mows through the Greek lines, killing eight warriors, and cuts the arm off the Greek warrior who had killed Klonie. Penthesilea&#x27;s Amazon comrades Bremusa, Evandre and Thermodosa fight valiantly alongside her but are slain, and so are Derinoe, Alkibie and Derimachea. Penthesilea slays more Greeks with axe and spear. From the towers the Trojan women watch and Penthesilea inspires the young Hippodamia, who urges the Trojan women to join the battle. Antimachus&#x27; daughter Tisiphone gives an inspirational speech: &quot;not in strength are we inferior to men; the same our eyes, our limbs the same; one common light we see, one air we breathe; nor different is the food we eat. What then denied to us hath heaven on man bestowed? O let us hasten to the glorious war!&quot;

==== Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae ====
At the Temple of Apollo Epicurius, built in the mid- to late-5th century BC, scenes from the Trojan War are preserved in the Bassae Frieze, a high relief marble sculpture in 23 panels. Here the Greek army is charged by the Amazons, who gain the upper hand, and at the height of the battle Achilles slays Penthesilea on a slab known as BM 537. Achilles and Penthesilea are flanked by a Greek soldier and an Amazon. Penthesilea is identified as a queen by a crown. Penthesilea, shown on the ground just before being struck, and Achilles are exchanging a gaze. The final slab of the series on the Amazons depicts a truce between the Greek army and the Amazons at the end of the battle.

==== Temple of Zeus at Olympia ====
According to Pausanias, the throne of Zeus at Olympia bore a painting by Panaenus of the dying Penthesilea being supported by Achilles. Pausanias wrote &quot;And, at the extremity of the painting, is Penthesilea breathing her last, and Achilles supporting her&quot;. The motif of Achilles supporting a dying or dead Penthesilea has been preserved at the Temple of Aphrodisias and was reinterpreted in sculptures and mosaics in ancient Rome.

==== Vase figure ====
A black-figure vase from about 510–500 BC shows Achilles carrying Penthesilea from the battlefield.

The subject of Penthesilea was treated so regularly by the so-called Penthesilea Painter, who was active between 470 and 450 BC, that Adolf Furtwängler dubbed him &quot;The Penthesilea Painter&quot;. A considerable corpus for this innovative and prolific painter, whose work bridged the Severe style and Classicism and must have had a workshop of his own, was rapidly assembled in part by J.D. Beazley.

== Later portrayals ==

=== In the Middle Ages ===

In Medieval Europe, the Penthesilea legend was developed and recycled, with Achilles fading into the background. In illuminations that illustrated manuscripts, Penthesilea was cast as medieval warrior queen. A tradition developed where Penthesilea entered the Trojan War because of her reverence for the Trojan hero Hector. Penthesilea appears in the &quot;Roman de Troie&quot; (1160) by Benoît de Sainte-Maure as a chivalric heroine, and through this became part of the medieval genre &quot;roman antique,&quot; which recycled Greek and Roman myths in a chivalric romance context.

In late medieval Europe the legend was further popularised in Christine de Pizan&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the City of Ladies&quot; (1405) and John Lydgate&#x27;s &quot;Troy Book&quot; (1420). Penthesilea and Hector became romantic heroes. Penthesilea came to Troy because she had fallen in love with the virtuous knight Hector from afar. Hector and Penthesilea were portrayed as personifications of the ideals of chivalry. When kneeling before Hector&#x27;s corpse, Penthesilea promises to avenge his death. Penthesilea fights at the side of the Trojan army, killing many Greek soldiers, but is slain by Achilles&#x27; son. In this tradition of the legend, her body is taken to the Thermodon for burial. Along the Terme River, various temple burial sites attest to the heroic status Penthesilea had as Amazon queen in the Middle Ages.

In John Gower&#x27;s Confessio Amanatis she travels to Troy from Pafagoine. She is slain by Pirrus the son of Achilles. Philemenis returned her body for burial. He was rewarded with three fair maidens per year.

Biographical lists of strong women were published, some included Penthesilea. The 1405 &quot;Chronicle&quot; (known as &quot;Haagse handschrift&quot;) by the herald Baviere included Penthesilea and the two Amazons Semiramis and Tomyris among the strong women. A Netherlandish list of 101 strong women published between 1465 and 1480 included Penthesilea. This list of 101 women circulated at the court of Mary of Burgundy and was read by members of the Brussels administration. Philippe Bouton in 1480 published a &quot;Miroir des dames&quot;, which included Penthesilea.

=== Boccaccio ===
Between 1361 and 1362 the Italian Giovanni Boccaccio wrote the first collection of biographies in Western literature that was devoted to famous women. The &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot; was published in Latin and dedicated to Andrea Acciaioli, the Countess of Altavilla. According to Boccaccio, Penthesilea succeeded the Amazon queens Antiope and Orithyia. She was in strength and skill superior to previous queens. According to Boccaccio, Penthesilea entered the Trojan War against the Greeks to impress Hector. But Penthesilea and her Amazon troops were slain at the end of a hard-fought battle with the Greeks. After recounting Penthesilea&#x27;s accomplishments in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot; Boccaccio wrote that &quot;if we remember that practical experience can change natural dispositions&quot; the legends of the Amazons become plausible. He wrote that &quot;through practice, Penthesilea and women like her became much more manly in arms than those born male&quot; who had been weakened through idleness and love of pleasure. The notion that upbringing and training were central to gender differences was discussed by Agostino Strozzi and Mario Equicola in 16th century Italy.

=== Heinrich von Kleist ===

The treatment of Penthesilea that has received most critical attention since the early twentieth century is the drama &quot;Penthesilea&quot; by Heinrich von Kleist, who cast its &quot;precipitously violent tempo&quot; in the form of twenty-four consecutive scenes without formal breaks into acts. In Kleist&#x27;s &quot;Penthesilea,&quot; however, Achilles is slain by Penthesilea. When she realizes that she and her pack of dogs have mangled the object of their desire, she dies herself through &quot;a crushing feeling&quot;.

The Swiss composer Othmar Schoeck wrote a 90&#x27; one-act opera, &quot;Penthesilea&quot; (Dresden, 1927) based on Kleist&#x27;s drama. The French composer Pascal Dusapin&#x27;s opera based on Kleist&#x27;s work premiered in 2015 at La Monnaie in Brussels under the baton of Ludovic Morlot.

=== Hugo Wolf ===
Austrian composer Hugo Wolf (1860-1903) wrote a symphonic poem on the legend entitled &quot;Penthesilea&quot; (1883–85).

=== Edward Bellamy===
In Edward Bellamy&#x27;s 1888 book &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, the main character (Julian West) is transported in time from 1887 (discovery date of the asteroid Penthesilea) to 2000. There, in the year 2000, the main character reads a book by one of the 20th century&#x27;s most famous writers by the fictional name of Berrian. The title of this book is &quot;Penthesilia&quot; [sic] and it is a romance that supposedly exposes the true power and fullest extent of love.

=== Robert Graves ===
In Robert Graves&#x27; short poem &quot;Penthesileia&quot;, Achilles becomes infatuated with Penthesilia immediately after killing her, and then slays Thersites for his mockery of Achilles&#x27; behavior. The last verse is open to interpretation, some have interpreted it that Penthelisea&#x27;s ghost thanks Thersites for standing up for her honour, but it has been suggested that she thanks Achilles for killing Thersites.

<text>In Greek mythology, an Amazonomachy (English translation: &quot;Amazon battle&quot;; plural, Amazonomachiai () or Amazonomachies) is a mythological battle between the ancient Greeks and the Amazons, a nation of all-female warriors. The subject of Amazonomachies was popular in ancient Greek art and Roman art.

== Amazonomachy in Myth ==
Throughout all of antiquity, the Amazons were regarded as a race of female warriors descended from Ares, fiercely independent and skilled in hunting, riding, archery, and warfare. They worshiped Ares and Artemis, respectively the god of war and the goddess of the hunt, and their geographic locations were notably associated with Scythia and the Asia Minor.

In Greek epic narratives, the Amazons were perceived to be non-Greek heroic figures who challenged the strength and masculinity of Greek heroes on the battlefield, such as Achilles, Bellerophon, Heracles (Hercules), Theseus, and the Athenians.

=== Trojan War, Achilles ===
In the lost Greek epic &quot;Aethiopis&quot;, which was published in the 8th century BCE and is widely attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, Achilles fights and kills Penthesilea, the queen of the Amazons who came to aid Troy after the death of Hector. The oral myths and retellings of this epic fall of Troy referencing the Amazons contributed to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

=== Ninth Labor, Hercules ===
During Hercules’ ninth labor, Hercules was given the task by Eurystheus to retrieve the royal girdle of the Amazon queen Hippolyta for his daughter. Though Hercules and the Amazons were originally open for peaceful negotiation, the malicious machinations of Hera incited a misunderstanding between the Amazons and Hercules, leading to a bloody battle in which the Amazons were ultimately defeated.

=== Attic War, Theseus ===
In some versions of the myth, Theseus had accompanied Hercules on his ninth labor and either eloped with or abducted Antiope, Hippolyta&#x27;s sister (or Hippolyta herself). Antiope was then taken to Athens by Theseus, whom she married and bore a son, Hippolytus. As a result of the kidnapping, the Amazons invaded Greece, inciting the legendary Attic War between the Amazons and Athenians, which ended in the Amazons’ defeat.

== Amazonomachy in Art ==
Warfare was a very popular subject in Ancient Greek art, represented in grand sculptural scenes on temples but also countless Greek vases. Along with scenes from Homer and the Gigantomachy, the Amazonomachy was a popular choice, depicting battles between Greek men and female foreigners. Later, in Roman art, there are many depictions on the sides of later Roman sarcophagi, when it became the fashion to depict elaborate reliefs of battle scenes. Scenes were also shown on mosaics. A trickle of medieval depictions increased at the Renaissance, and especially in the Baroque period.

=== Early Greek Shields ===
Early Greek art typically depicted Amazons in battle, frequently shown riding horses or wielding weapons such as bows and arrows, swords, spears, and shields. Based on existing evidence, the first indications of these female warriors entering art was in votary shields and shield decorations, with the earliest example being on a clay shield from Tiryns from around 700 B.C.

=== Ancient Greek Pottery ===
Amazons began to be featured prominently on Attic vases from around 570 BCE onward until the middle of the 5th Century. During the beginning of this time period, Amazons were most popularly depicted on Attic black-figure pottery, depicting Amazon battle scenes during the Trojan War or, more commonly, during Hercules&#x27; legendary ninth labor. Some of such vessels were inscribed with names of Amazons, with Andromache being named the most often, though none of the non-Herculean battles possessed such inscriptions. Hercules was quite often portrayed on such vessels to be in single combat against three Amazons or more.

Amazons were eventually seen on red-figure pottery as black-figure pottery gradually became less popular during the last quarter of the 6th Century. It was also around this time that Theseus also became a common feature in art depicting the Amazonomachy.

=== Greek Architecture ===
Depictions of Amazon battles in Greek architecture generally fell into the category of late antique to post-classical architectural sculpture. Examples of this can be found on the west gable of the temple of Apollo at Eretria (from around the end of the 6th century BC), and on the metopes or friezes at places such as the Athenian treasury at Delphi (490 BC), the Hephaestium at Athens (450 BC), the temple of Zeus at Olympia (460 BC), the temple of Apollo at Bassae (410 BC), the east hill at Selinunte (470 BC), the mausoleum at Halicarnassus (350 BC), and the Artemis temple in Magnesia (2nd century BC).

After the Persian Wars, the Greeks attached greater significance to such battle scenes, referencing the Attic War as a mythological example of Athens’ successful defense against foreign invaders. In particular, this Attic amazonomachy was depicted on places such as the west metope on the Parthenon (around 440 BC), shield of Athena Parthenos (around 440 BC), and in the Stoa Poikile in Athens (460 BC).

==== West Metopes of Parthenon ====
Kalamis, a Greek sculptor, is attributed to designing the west metopes of the Parthenon, a temple on the Athenian Acropolis dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena. The west metopes of the Parthenon depict a battle between Greeks and Amazons. Despite its mutilated state, scholars generally concur that the scene represents the Amazon invasion of Attica.

==== Shield of Athena Parthenos ====
The shield of Athena Parthenos, sculpted by Phidias, depicts a fallen Amazon. Athena Parthenos was a massive chryselephantine sculpture of Athena, the main cult image inside the Parthenon at Athens, which is now lost, though known from descriptions and small ancient copies.

==== Frieze in Temple of Apollo at Bassae ====

The Bassae Frieze, from the Temple of Apollo at Bassae, contains a number of slabs portraying Trojan Amazonomachy and Heraclean Amazonomachy. The Trojan Amazonomachy spans three blocks, displaying the eventual death of Penthesilea at the hands of Achilles. The Heraclean Amazonomachy spans eight blocks and represents the struggle of Heracles to seize the belt of the Amazon queen Hippolyta.

==== Frieze from Mausoleum at Halicarnassus ====

Several sections of an Amazonomachy frieze from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus are now in the British Museum. One part depicts Heracles grasping an Amazon by the hair, while holding a club behind his head in a striking manner. This Amazon is believed to be the Amazon queen Hippolyta. Behind Heracles is a scene of a Greek warrior clashing shields with an Amazon warrior. Another slab displays a mounted Amazon charging at a Greek, who is defending himself with a raised shield. This Greek is believed to be Theseus, who joined Heracles during his labors.

==== Other ====
Micon painted the Amazonomachy on the Stoa Poikile of the Ancient Agora of Athens, which is now lost.
Phidias depicted Amazonomachy on the footstool of the chryselephantine statue of Zeus at Olympia.

In 2018, archaeologists discovered relief-decorated shoulder boards made from bronze that were part of a breastplate of a Greek warrior at a Celtic sacrificial place near the village of Slatina nad Bebravou in Slovakia. Deputy of director of Slovak Archaeological Institute said that it is the oldest original Greek art relic in the area of Slovakia. Researchers analyzed the pieces and determined they were once part of a relief that depicted the Amazonomachy.
=== Roman Sarcophagi ===
Many representations of Amazons from the Roman times have also been found, with images of the amazonomachy included on mosaics, coins, friezes, votive reliefs, and so on. Notably, more than 60 sarcophagus reliefs have been found to depict scenes of conflict between the Amazons and Greeks.

== Symbolism of Amazonomachy ==
Amazonomachy represents the Greek ideal of civilization. The Amazons were portrayed as a savage and barbaric race, while the Greeks were portrayed as a civilized race of human progress.
According to Bruno Snell&#x27;s view of Amazonomachy:

For the Greeks, the Titanomachy and the battle against the giants remained symbols of the victory which their own world had won over a strange universe; along with the battles against the Amazons and Centaurs they continue to signalize the Greek conquest of everything barbarous, of all monstrosity and grossness.In Quintus Smyrnaeus&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of Troy&quot;, Penthesilea, an Amazonian queen, who joined on the side of the Trojans during the Trojan war, was quoted at Troy, saying:

Not in strength are we inferior to men; the same our eyes, our limbs the same; one common light we see, one air we breathe; nor different is the food we eat. What then denied to us hath heaven on man bestowed?

According to Josine Blok, Amazonomachy provides two different contexts for defining a Greek hero. Either the Amazons are one of the disasters from which the hero rids the country after his victory over a monster, or they are an expression of the underlying Attis motif in which the hero shuns human sexuality in marriage and procreation.

In the 5th century BC, the Achaemenid Empire began a series of invasions against Greece. Because of this, some scholars believe that in most Greek art of that time, Persians were shown allegorically through the figure of centaurs and Amazons.

Literature such as Lysias&#x27; &quot;Epitaphios&quot; and Isocrates&#x27; &quot;Panegyrikos&quot; further strengthen this parallel to the defeat of the Persians, as their versions of the Attic War similarly climax with the total annihilation of the invading forces.

According to Jeremy McInerney, Kleidemos&#x27; account of the Attic War was politically connoted in such a way that Theseus&#x27; defeat of the Persians not only represented the victory of Athens as a whole, but also reaffirmed certain values of Athenian democracy, likely during a period of political and historical tension in the 4th century BC.

Modern interpretations also view the amazonomachy as largely symbolic of the conflict between the ancient Greek patriarchal model of civilization against (the influence of) the foreign, gender-transgressive female. The various amazonomachiai in Greek myths were typically concluded with the triumph of some Athenian male hero (such as Hercules or Theseus) over famous Amazons, who were killed in combat or sexually subjugated by Greek men. According to these modern scholars, the male hero&#x27;s quintessential defeat of the Amazons in mythology (as well as Amazon grave markers) reinforced and reminded the Greek populace of the supremacy of Athens&#x27; patriarchal model of civilization and society.

== Historical Existence of Amazonomachy ==

=== Accounts of Amazon Graves ===
In Athens, there were tombs of Amazons, possibly located in the Amazoneion, northwest of the Areópagos. This area was close to the ancient agora of Theseus, and the Theseion may have been nearby.

Writers such as Plutarch, Kleidemos, and Pausanias cited the existence of Amazon graves throughout Athens to be historical evidence and landmarks of the Amazons’ campaign against the city. As stated in Plutarch’s &quot;Life of Theseus&quot;: “... the fact that [the Amazons] encamped virtually within the city is supported both by place names and by the graves of the fallen.”

Many of these writers&#x27; renditions of the battles between the Amazons and Greeks were based on the distribution and of graves attributed to the Amazons throughout Athens. Plutarch&#x27;s account later goes on to cite Kleidemos in his description of how the Attic amazonomachy corresponded with the placement of some of the Athenian Amazon graves: The left wing of the Amazons extended to what is now called the Amazoneion … and the Athenians fought against this, attacking the Amazons from the Mouseion hill, and the graves of the fallen are along the wide street that goes to the gate at the Heroon of Chalcodon, which they now call the Peiraic Gate. The grave of Theseus’ wife (either Antiope or Hippolyta) was identified by Pausanias (1.2.1) and Plutarch (Theseus 27.5) to be located near the Sanctuary of Gaia in Athens. Another Amazon Molpadia was said to have died and been buried there as well during the Amazons&#x27; campaign.

According to (the Boeotian) Plutarch, Amazons were not only buried in Athens but were also known to have fled and possibly engaged in further battles elsewhere, being buried in places such as Megara, Boiotia, Chalkis, and in Thessaly at Skotoussa and Kynoskephalai.

=== Possible Historical Counterparts   ===

As Greek civilization began to extend to areas around the Black Sea, the Greeks began to identify and associate these mythical wild and warlike foreign females with the Scythians in their artwork and literature. In particular, the Amazons were often portrayed similarly to steppe nomad horsewomen. As the Greeks became more aware of steppe nomad cultures, their depictions of the Amazons in art and literature began to integrate more realistic details corresponding to the artifacts (weaponry, attire, &amp; equipment) found in kurgans (grave mounds) of Scythians.

Despite the lack of conclusive evidence pointing to the existence of the Amazons, some modern scholars and archaeologists have claimed that such steppe nomad horsewomen could have potentially existed as the Amazons’ historical counterparts. Though their actual connection to the mythical Amazons is controversial, there is evidence which supports the historical existence of such steppe warrior women, as modern excavations in the 20th century have discovered more than 1,000 tombs of tribes such as the Saka-Scythians across the Eurasian steppes, of which about 300 of these burials have been identified to be those of armed warrior women (as of 2016).

<doc id="78598" wikidata="Q637771" url="?curid=78598" title="Wilco">
<text>Wilco is an American rock band based in Chicago. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo after singer Jay Farrar&#x27;s departure. Wilco&#x27;s lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004 the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released thirteen studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with the Minus 5.

Wilco&#x27;s music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles including Bill Fay, the Beatles, and Television; in turn the band has influenced music by many modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country style of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album &quot;A.M.&quot; (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco&#x27;s musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current &quot;eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres&quot;.

Wilco received media attention for their fourth album, &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; (2001), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming &quot;Foxtrot&quot; on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading a critic to say the album showed &quot;how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century.&quot; The event was immortalized in the documentary &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot;; director Sam Jones followed the band as they wrote and produced the record. &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; is Wilco&#x27;s most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004&#x27;s &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot;, including Best Alternative Music Album. Wilco released their thirteenth studio album, &quot;Cousin&quot;, in September 2023.

==History==

===Formation, &quot;A.M.&quot;, and &quot;Being There&quot; (1994–1996)===

Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group Uncle Tupelo. Singer Jay Farrar quit the band in 1994 because of a soured relationship with co-singer Jeff Tweedy. Both Tweedy and Farrar immediately sought to form bands after the breakup, with Farrar organizing Son Volt. Tweedy&#x27;s new band included all current members of Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including bassist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist Brian Henneman of the Bottle Rockets to perform, who appears on many of the tracks for Wilco&#x27;s debut album, &quot;A.M.&quot;. The group considered retaining the Uncle Tupelo name but decided to call themselves &quot;Wilco&quot; after the military and commercial aviation radio voice abbreviation for &quot;will comply&quot;, a choice which Tweedy has said is &quot;fairly ironic for a rock band to name themselves.&quot;

After collaborating with Syd Straw on a cover version of the Ernest Tubb song &quot;The T.B. is Whipping Me&quot; (released in September 1994 on the &quot;Red Hot + Country&quot; compilation produced by the Red Hot Organization), Wilco began recording tracks for &quot;A.M.&quot;, their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1994. A demo tape from the recordings was sent to executives at Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy said that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract. Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission—John Stirratt&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Just That Simple&quot;—appeared on &quot;A.M.&quot;. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides Tweedy.

Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on &quot;A.M.&quot; was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as &quot;trying to tread some water with a perceived audience.&quot; &quot;A.M.&quot; peaked at number twenty-seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar&#x27;s new band, Son Volt. The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s 1995 Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt&#x27;s album, the Wilco members perceived &quot;A.M.&quot; to be a failure. Shortly after the release of the album, multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett joined the band, providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitarist.

Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero&#x27;s Basement Bar in St. Louis, Missouri (the band was billed for the occasion as &quot;Black Shampoo&quot;). During the two hundred-date tour supporting &quot;A.M.&quot;, Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated:

The whole &quot;No Depression&quot; thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on &quot;Misunderstood,&quot; where I&#x27;m playing guitar.

Wilco recorded a number of songs with this theme, including &quot;Sunken Treasure&quot; and &quot;Hotel Arizona.&quot; Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of &quot;A.M.&quot; Wilco named the album &quot;Being There&quot; after a Peter Sellers film of the same name. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of Freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio, playing pedal steel guitar on &quot;Far, Far Away&quot; and &quot;Dreamer in My Dreams&quot;, and then became an official member in September 1996.

Unlike the &quot;A.M.&quot; recording sessions, the band had no desire to produce a hit song from their second effort. The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco&#x27;s share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied. &quot;Being There&quot; was well received by critics from several major media outlets, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The album reached No. 73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts, a significant improvement from &quot;A.M.&quot;, and placed fourteenth on the Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1996. The album&#x27;s single &quot;Outtasite (Outta Mind)&quot; became the group&#x27;s first song to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, reaching No. 39 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 22 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

===&quot;Summerteeth&quot; and the &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; sessions (1997–2000)===
In November 1997, Wilco entered Willie Nelson&#x27;s recording studio in Spicewood, Texas to record a third studio album. The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century literature. Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer&#x27;s &quot;bold, but depressing&quot; lyrics. Wilco recorded several songs, including &quot;Via Chicago&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s a Jar&quot;, but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.

Nora Guthrie contacted singer-songwriter Billy Bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer Woody Guthrie. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie&#x27;s life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of Huntington&#x27;s disease. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a &quot;relic&quot; to the MTV generation, and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was &quot;the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody.&quot; Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.

Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their &quot;Being There&quot; tour. Bragg was particularly fond of &quot;Being There&quot; because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs with one of his idols—Bennett&#x27;s previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a &quot;freak weirdo.&quot; The recording of &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Man in the Sand&quot; documentary film.

Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco&#x27;s sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg&#x27;s songs, to which Bragg responded &quot;you make your record, and I&#x27;ll make mine...&quot; Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.

Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies. The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. It also placed fourth on the Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for 1998. After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach.

After the completion of the &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, &quot;Summerteeth&quot;. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with Pro Tools. Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:

The story of &quot;Summerteeth&quot; is Jay bought a Mellotron and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn&#x27;t stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness ... It reminds me of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you&#x27;re looking for.

During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with Time Inc. As a result, Warner&#x27;s imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, Howie Klein, who had previously authorized the release of &quot;Being There&quot; as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce &quot;Summerteeth&quot; without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise&#x27;s A&amp;R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this &quot;once and once only&quot; and recorded a radio-friendly version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand It&quot; at the request of David Kahne, the head of the A&amp;R department. The single version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand It&quot; failed to cross over from Triple-A radio to alternative rock stations. The album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than &quot;Being There&quot; despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for 1999.

After the release of &quot;Summerteeth&quot;, the band resumed the &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for &quot;Mermaid Avenue Vol. II&quot;. &quot;Someday Some Morning Sometime,&quot; featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo, was identified by Tweedy as being the &quot;piece to the puzzle&quot; towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions. The remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as &quot;Mermaid Avenue Vol. III&quot;, also part of &quot;Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions&quot;.

===Departure from Reprise Records and &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; (2001–2002)===
Shortly after the recording sessions for &quot;Mermaid Avenue Vol. II&quot;, Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft. The band recorded tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with Jim O&#x27;Rourke at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s &quot;Bad Timing&quot;. O&#x27;Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named Loose Fur. Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche&#x27;s contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.

Although Bennett sought to be the mixer and engineer for &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, Tweedy was unsure of Bennett&#x27;s abilities compared to O&#x27;Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground. Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O&#x27;Rourke to remix &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot;, and the results impressed the other band members—even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O&#x27;Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O&#x27;Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as &quot;Poor Places&quot;, only featured the Loose Fur trio. The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards. The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco&quot;.

Time Warner, which owned Warner Bros. Records, merged with America Online in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner&#x27;s record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records.

David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise. Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disliked the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions. He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the album was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label.

Wilco managed to negotiate a buy-out from Reprise. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;. The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco&#x27;s request. However, AllMusic claims &quot;Warner/Reprise agreed to sell them the masters for a reported $50,000&quot; after Wilco was &quot;unwilling to change the album to make it more &#x27;commercially viable&#x27;.&quot; In a last-minute decision, the label freed Wilco from their contract and gave them the album at no charge. Curbing the negative publicity, Warner Music Group began to invest more in bands including The Flaming Lips. Lead singer Wayne Coyne remarked:

We are benefiting from the label&#x27;s regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, &quot;we&#x27;ll never have a band like Wilco feel we don&#x27;t believe in them again.&quot; They&#x27;d tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me!

As the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it on their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality MP3s. The band signed with Nonesuch Records, another Time Warner subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002. When it was released, &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; reached number thirteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Wilco&#x27;s highest chart position to that date. &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; sold over 590,000 copies, and to date remains Wilco&#x27;s best-selling album. &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; was met with extensive critical acclaim: it topped 2002&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll and was named one of the 100 greatest albums of all time by &quot;Q Magazine&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated it at 493 of their 500 Greatest Albums of all Time, in May 2012. In the 2020 reboot of the list, its ranking was raised to #225.

In September 2022 the band released a variety of reissues of the album, including an 11-LP &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; version. The reissue won a Grammy for Best Historical Album.

===&quot;Down with Wilco&quot;, &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot;, and &quot;Kicking Television&quot; (2003–2005)===
While waiting for the commercial release of &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, Wilco agreed to support R.E.M. collaborator Scott McCaughey for an album release by The Minus 5. They scheduled a recording session for September 11, 2001, but were distraught about the 9/11 terrorist attacks that day. Later that day, Wilco and McCaughey agreed to &quot;create something good in the world right now&quot; and record some material. Influenced by Bill Fay&#x27;s &quot;Time of the Last Persecution&quot;, The Minus 5&#x27;s &quot;Down with Wilco&quot; was released in 2003. Keyboardist Mikael Jorgensen, who had engineered &quot;Down with Wilco&quot;, joined Wilco in 2002 as they toured in support of &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;.

In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. The album was produced by Jim O&#x27;Rourke, who mixed &quot;Foxtrot&quot; and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. Unlike &quot;Summerteeth&quot; and &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live. The album featured the song &quot;Less Than You Think&quot;, which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called &quot;the track that everyone will hate&quot;. Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song:

Leroy Bach left the band immediately after the album&#x27;s completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago. Like &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;, Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release. Instead of using their own web page, the band streamed it in MPEG-4 form on Apple&#x27;s website. Wilco decided to substantially change their lineup after Bach&#x27;s departure adding Pat Sansone of The Autumn Defense, and avant-garde guitarist Nels Cline to the lineup. Just as the band was about to tour to promote the album, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago for an addiction to opioids. As a result, tour plans for Europe were canceled, and the release date for the album was set back several weeks. &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; was released on June 22, 2004, and became Wilco&#x27;s first top ten album in the U.S. The album earned Wilco Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package in 2005. It also placed thirteenth on 2004&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll.

In 2004, the band released &quot;The Wilco Book&quot;, a picture book detailing the creation of &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot;. The book also contains writings and drawings from band members, as well as a CD with demos from the &quot;A Ghost Is Born&quot; recording sessions. Also that year, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; music critic Greg Kot released a biography of the band entitled &quot;&quot;. The new six-piece Wilco lineup, which has remained intact ever since, debuted on &quot;Kicking Television: Live in Chicago&quot;, a two disc live album recorded at The Vic Theater in Chicago. Released on November 15, 2005, the album received high accolades from &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. As of 2007 it has sold over 114,000 copies.

===&quot;Sky Blue Sky&quot; (2006–2008)===

Wilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006. Influenced by The Byrds and Fairport Convention, the band considered &quot;Sky Blue Sky&quot; to be less experimental than previous releases. Also unlike on previous albums, the songs were created as collaborations.

Wilco streamed the album online on March 3, 2007, and offered the song &quot;What Light&quot; as a free MP3 download. Further publicizing the album, Wilco licensed several songs from the &quot;Sky Blue Sky&quot; recording sessions for use in a Volkswagen advertising campaign. The move was criticized by both critics and fans; Wilco responded by noting that they had previously done advertising campaigns with Apple Inc. and Telefónica Móviles (Movistar). The album was released on May 15, 2007, and was a commercial success: it sold over 87,000 copies in its first week and peaked in the top five in the U.S. album charts. It was a top forty hit in seven other countries.

Reviewer James Brubaker says that Wilco &quot;shine[s] on a handful of the songs&quot; on &quot;Sky Blue Sky&quot;, such as the &quot;light, and straightforward&quot; songs. While he calls it a &quot;great traditional rock and folk album at times...the rest of the record comes off at times as dull, and forced.&quot; A review in &quot;allaboutjazz&quot; also had mixed comments. While praising the album as &quot;deceptively insinuating, almost intoxicating to listen to&quot; and noting its &quot;impeccable sound quality,&quot; the review said that &quot;&quot;Sky Blue Sky&quot; becomes the first Wilco album that sounds too careful for its own good.&quot;

Pabs Hernandez, a reviewer for &quot;Lost at Sea&quot;, praised the album&#x27;s &quot;breezy atmosphere and pacing,&quot; and noted that it is not &quot;easily judged upon first listen.&quot; Overall, Hernandez mentioned that it &quot;may be no masterpiece, but at worst it&#x27;s a more than worthy entry into Wilco&#x27;s laudable catalogue.&quot; Reviewer Greg Locke praised the record as &quot;one of the best albums of the year,&quot; calling it a &quot;timeless record, full of sweet, hopeful sophistication and class&quot; and &quot;a lean, mean, soulful album.&quot; Like Hernandez, Locke acknowledged that the album could not be properly judged just on the first listening. The NPR review also had a positive take on the record. While the NPR reviewer stated that the recording &quot;isn&#x27;t groundbreaking,&quot; they praised its &quot;coherent musical expression&quot; and emphasis on &quot;solid songcraft without pretense&quot; which created a &quot;satisfying and melodically sound album.&quot;

In anticipation of the 2008 US presidential election, Wilco released a downloadable version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; that they performed with Fleet Foxes. The MP3 was available as a free download from the band&#x27;s website in exchange for a promise to vote in the election. The band also made an appearance on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; to support presidential candidate Barack Obama. Wilco released a live performance DVD, &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot;, on April 18, 2009, to celebrate Record Store Day.

In December 2008, Jeff Tweedy, Pat Sansone, Glenn Kotche, and John Stirratt traveled to Auckland, New Zealand to participate in Neil Finn&#x27;s 7 Worlds Collide sequel project, The Sun Came Out, joined by Ed O&#x27;Brien, Phil Selway, Johnny Marr, KT Tunstall, Liam Finn, and Lisa Germano. They wrote and recorded several new tracks for the Oxfam-benefiting album including &quot;You Never Know,&quot; &quot;What Could Have Been,&quot; &quot;Over and Done,&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me.&quot; Jeff Tweedy co-wrote &quot;Too Blue&quot; with Johnny Marr, and Glenn, John, and Pat play on most tracks on the album.

The band stayed in Auckland through January recording for their next album at Finn&#x27;s own Roundhead Studios. Jim Scott, who was the engineer and mixer for the Neil Finn project, stayed on in the same capacity for the Wilco sessions. Nels Cline and Mikael Jorgensen later added overdubs to the tracks at the band&#x27;s Chicago Loft.

===&quot;Wilco (The Album)&quot;, founding dBpm Records, and &quot;The Whole Love&quot; (2009–2011)===
Wilco released their seventh album, &quot;Wilco (The Album)&quot;, on June 30, 2009. In March 2009, it was announced that singer-songwriter Feist would make a guest appearance on the new album, on the track &quot;You and I&quot;. As with their previous three albums, Wilco streamed the entirety of the album on its website prior to release. The album hit the charts at a career-high No. 4 with sales of 99,000 on the Billboard Top 200 Album chart as well as the No. 2 spot on Billboard&#x27;s Top Rock Albums chart. It marked Wilco&#x27;s third top 10 album on the U.S. pop chart. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;You Never Know&quot; reached the No. 1 spot on the AAA Chart, their first No. 1 in twelve years.

Beginning in April 2009, the band freely distributed a cover of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;The Jolly Banker&quot;, downloadable from their website. It was recorded at the Wilco loft in February of that year, at the suggestion of Guthrie&#x27;s daughter, Nora. Those downloading the album were encouraged to donate to the Woody Guthrie Foundation. Feist returned to accompany on the track, playing the Garden Weasel. The track eventually became unavailable for download. In October 2011, the website began streaming the track via a plugin.

On May 25, 2009, former band member Jay Bennett died in his home in Urbana, Illinois. In a prepared statement, Jeff Tweedy said that he was &quot;deeply saddened&quot; by Bennett&#x27;s death.

Feist and Wilco performed &quot;You and I&quot; on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on July 14, 2009. In June during their West Coast tour, Wilco joined Beck, Feist, Jamie Lidell and James Gadson in the studio to take part in Beck&#x27;s Record Club project, covering Skip Spence&#x27;s &quot;Oar&quot; album. The first song &quot;Little Hands&quot; was posted on Beck&#x27;s website on November 12, 2009.

On April 6, 2010, Wilco announced during their Boston performance that they would be headlining and curating a festival in North Adams, Massachusetts, dubbed Solid Sound Festival. The event ran at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art from August 13–15, and featured various Wilco side projects, including The Autumn Defense, Pronto, The Nels Cline Singers, and Jeff Tweedy solo. Other bands who appeared included Mavis Staples, Avi Buffalo, Outrageous Cherry, Richard Bishop, the Books, and Vetiver. It also featured non-musical media, such as the Bread and Puppet Theater and comedians Todd Barry, Kristen Schaal, John Mulaney, and Hannibal Buress as well as interactive musical installations by Cline and Kotche. In November 2016, the band also curated their own program during the tenth Anniversary Edition of Le Guess Who? Festival in Utrecht, The Netherlands. This curated program includes performances by amongst others Tortoise, Bassekou Kouyaté, Lee Ranaldo, Fennesz, Steve Gunn, William Tyler, and The Cairo Gang.

Wilco&#x27;s contract with Nonesuch ended in 2010 and they formed their own label. Wilco announced via their web site and Twitter page on January 27, 2011 that the new label will be called dBpm Records (Decibels per Minute) and will be run out of the offices of their manager, Tony Margherita, in Easthampton, Massachusetts.

Wilco&#x27;s released their eighth studio album, &quot;The Whole Love&quot;, on September 27, 2011. The first single of the album is titled &quot;Art of Almost&quot;. The B-Side to &quot;I Might&quot; is a cover of Nick Lowe&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;I Love My Label&quot;. The single was shown at the Wilco&#x27;s 2011 Solid Sound Festival at MassMoca and was met by positive reviews. The entire album was streamed live on Wilco&#x27;s official website for 24 hours between September 3 and 4, 2011.
===&quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Schmilco&quot;, and &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; (2015–2021)===

Wilco&#x27;s released their ninth studio album, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, on July 16, 2015 as a surprise free download. In October 2015, Wilco announced that they would embark on a U.S. tour beginning in early 2016 in support of the album. In December 2015, &quot;Star Wars&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

On July 14, 2016, the band released a new single, titled &quot;Locator&quot;, as a free download. Four days later, the band released another new single, titled &quot;If I Ever Was a Child&quot;, and announced that their tenth album, &quot;Schmilco&quot;, would be released on September 9. &quot;Schmilco&quot; earned generally favourable reviews, earning a positive score of 79 on Metacritic, while reviewer Josh Modell said that the album is &quot;Wilco&#x27;s most musically simple and emotionally resonant record in a decade.&quot; On Monday, August 14, 2017, Wilco released a single, &quot;All Lives You Say&quot; on their Bandcamp page to benefit the SPLC in memory of Tweedy&#x27;s father Robert, who died on August 4. Sharing the news Tweedy said, &quot;My dad was named after a Civil War general, and he voted for Barack Obama twice. He used to say &#x27;If you know better, you can do better.&#x27; America-we know better, we can do better.&quot;

Wilco took 2018 off from touring while Glenn Kotche lived in Finland after his wife Miiri received a Fulbright scholarship. The band announced an end to their performing hiatus and the release of the album &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; on July 16, 2019. The album was released on October 4, 2019 and received generally positive reviews with Will Hermes of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calling it their &quot;best in years&quot; and delivers &quot;something like love shines through, and it winds up sounding joyful indeed, in a hard-won way.&quot; The album won the Grammy Award for best Special Limited Edition Package.

Wilco followed the release with an autumn tour, the tour later being extended into 2020. In March 2020, Wilco and Sleater-Kinney announced that over the summer they would be embarking on the co-headlining It&#x27;s Time Tour. After the cancellation of the tour in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Wilco and Sleater-Kinney eventually rescheduled the tour for the summer of 2021. In October 2021, Wilco was inducted into the &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; Hall of Fame for their multiple contributions to the live music series that airs on PBS.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, the band released the single &quot;Tell Your Friends&quot; on Bandcamp on May 20, 2020, with all proceeds benefiting World Central Kitchen. In July 2020, as a voice to the larger cultural discussion and protests surrounding the murder of George Floyd, Tweedy announced that 5% of all his writer royalties would be donated to a program that distributes the funds to organizations fighting for racial justice, saying that the modern music industry is &quot;built almost entirely on black art&quot; and that &quot;the wealth that rightfully belonged to black artists was stolen outright and to this day continues to grow outside their communities.&quot;

=== Jay Bennett documentary, &quot;Cruel Country&quot;, and &quot;Cousin&quot; (2021–present)===
In 2021, a feature-length documentary about the life of Jay Bennett was released. The film focused heavily on Bennett&#x27;s years with Wilco. Directed by Gorman Bechard and Fred Uhter, the music documentary held its world premiere in Chicago in November 2021; it was released on Blu Ray and pay-per-view on April 19, 2022, and as part of a Record Store Day release with vinyl editions of Bennett&#x27;s last two albums, &quot;Whatever Happened I Apologize&quot; and &quot;Kicking at the Perfumed Air&quot; on April 23, 2022.

&quot;The new film does a wonderful job of capturing the quirkiness, inventiveness and brilliance of someone who never met an instrument he couldn&#x27;t play. Bennett once described hearing the open spaces of the songs and holes that became his sonic landscape. They were at the core of the remarkable string of Wilco&#x27;s albums &quot;Being There&quot;, &quot;Summerteeth,&quot; and &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;.&quot;

The film was originally started by Uhter, who asked the prolific Bechard to take over the project when it stalled. It takes a hard look at Bennett&#x27;s treatment in the previous Wilco documentary, &quot;I Am Trying To Break Your Heart&quot;, which many consider to be unfair. &quot;Jay Bennett&#x27;s reputation never quite recovered from the battering it took in Sam Jones&#x27; documentary &quot;I Am Trying To Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco&quot;, about the complex, lengthy gestation of 2002&#x27;s &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; in often painful detail, portrayed a band slowly pulling itself apart, with chief songwriters Bennett and Jeff Tweedy its twin opposing forces. The implication being that Bennett was a headstrong, intractable figure responsible for most of the discord. He was sacked as soon as the album was done. Filmmakers Gorman Bechard and Fred Uhter seek to redress the balance on &quot;Where Are You, Jay Bennett?&quot;&quot;. The film painted a much more balanced picture of the relationship between Bennett and Tweedy. &quot;They just happened to be two egos at that point, fueled by a lot of demons. And it just wasn&#x27;t working anymore,&quot; Bechard explained. &quot;They&#x27;re both incredibly talented. They both had egos. They both, I think, saw maybe different paths for the band. And ultimately it was Jeff&#x27;s band, so he&#x27;s going to win that, and rightfully so. There were other issues, whether it be alcohol or drugs. You know, it was a little bit of everything. Personally, I wish they had stayed together because I think they could have literally become the next Lennon and McCartney or the next Jagger/Richards.&quot;

In April 2022, the band announced their twelfth studio album, &quot;Cruel Country&quot;, which they released on May 27. The album was recorded entirely in person in live sessions at The Loft, the first album since 2007&#x27;s &quot;Sky Blue Sky.&quot; Tweedy described the album as saying, &quot;We&#x27;ve never been particularly comfortable with accepting [...] the idea that I was making country music. But now, having been around the block a few times, we&#x27;re finding it exhilarating to free ourselves within the form, and embrace the simple limitation of calling the music we&#x27;re making country.&quot;

In August 2023, the band announced their thirteenth studio album, &quot;Cousin&quot;, which they released on September 29. Welsh musician Cate Le Bon produced the album.

On May 29, 2024, the band announced a new EP, &quot;Hot Sun Cool Shroud&quot;. It was released on June 28.

==Musical style and influence==
Mark Deming of AllMusic described Wilco&#x27;s early releases as &quot;rough-and-tumble alt-country&quot; and their later releases as &quot;mature and &quot;. Although they have a career-long association with a major record label, Wilco are generally associated with indie rock. The band has additionally been described by journalists as alternative rock, alt-country, art rock, experimental rock, and folk rock. Wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres, but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974. John Cale&#x27;s &quot;Paris 1919&quot; was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel. According to Tweedy, &quot;It was eye-opening that I wasn&#x27;t the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they&#x27;d been given credit for—that experimentation and avant-garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty, y&#x27;know?&quot;

Other recording artists from the timespan cited as most influential by the band include John Lennon, Neil Young, and Brian Wilson. As a gift for his thirty-fourth birthday, Tweedy received a private guitar lesson from Richard Lloyd of Television; Tweedy was a fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work, which he wanted to incorporate into his music. Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as Jason &amp; the Scorchers and the Minutemen, influencing the recording of Wilco&#x27;s &quot;A.M.&quot;. Tweedy and O&#x27;Rourke enjoyed free jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Derek Bailey; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane. The lyrical structure of Wilco&#x27;s songs was dictated by classic literature and &quot;cadavre exquis&quot;—an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter, but are only allowed to see the previously written line. Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include William H. Gass&#x27;s &quot;In the Heart of the Heart of the Country&quot;, Henry Miller&#x27;s &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, and Harold Bloom&#x27;s &quot;The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry&quot;.

Some critics have dubbed Wilco the &quot;American Radiohead&quot;, due to the band&#x27;s stylistically diverse catalog. A critic from the &quot;New York Times&quot; argues that Wilco has a &quot;roots-rock ... [sound which] reached back to proven materials: the twang of country, the steady chug of 1960s rock, the undulating sheen of the Beach Boys, the honky-tonk hymns of the Band and the melodic symmetries of pop.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Wilco as &quot;one of America&#x27;s most consistently interesting bands&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s foremost rock impressionists.&quot; Bands that Wilco has influenced include Derek Webb (of Caedmon&#x27;s Call), the National, and Grace Potter and the Nocturnals. Adam Grunduciel of The War on Drugs calls Wilco his &quot;Favorite modern day band.&quot; Norah Jones performed a cover of &quot;Jesus, Etc.&quot; at the 2008 Bridge School Benefit where both Jones and Wilco performed; a version of the song was released as a bonus track on Jones&#x27; album &quot;The Fall&quot; in 2009. Counting Crows also covered the song &quot;California Stars.&quot;

<doc id="78634" wikidata="Q181560" url="?curid=78634" title="Carambola">
<text>Carambola, also known as star fruit, is the fruit of &quot;Averrhoa carambola&quot;, a species of tree native to tropical Southeast Asia. The edible fruit has distinctive ridges running down its sides (usually 5–6). When cut in cross-section, it resembles a star, giving it the name of &quot;star fruit&quot;. The entire fruit is edible, usually raw, and may be cooked or made into relishes, preserves, garnish, and juices. It is commonly consumed in Southeast Asia, South Asia, the South Pacific, Micronesia, parts of East Asia, the United States, parts of Latin America, and the Caribbean. The tree is cultivated throughout tropical areas of the world.

Carambola fruits contain oxalic acid and the neurotoxin caramboxin. Consuming large quantities of the fruit, especially for individuals with some types of kidney disease, can result in serious adverse health effects.

==Origins and distribution==


The center of diversity and the original range of &quot;Averrhoa carambola&quot; is tropical Southeast Asia, where it has been cultivated over centuries. It was introduced to the Indian Subcontinent and Sri Lanka by Austronesian traders, along with ancient Austronesian cultigens like langsat, noni, and santol. They remain common in those areas and in East Asia and throughout Oceania and the Pacific Islands. They are cultivated commercially in India, Southeast Asia, southern China, Taiwan, and 
the southern United States. They are also grown in Central America, South America, and the U.S. state of Hawaii, the Caribbean, and parts of Africa. They are grown as ornamentals. Carambola is considered to be at risk of becoming an invasive species in many world regions.

==Description==
The carambola tree has a short trunk with many branches, reaching up to in height. Its deciduous leaves are long, with 5 to 11 ovate leaflets medium-green in color. Flowers are lilac in color, with purple streaks, and are about wide. 

The showy fruits have a thin, waxy pericarp, orange-yellow skin, and crisp, yellow flesh with juice when ripe. The fruit is about in length and is an oval shape. It usually has five or six prominent longitudinal ridges. In cross-section, it resembles a star. The flesh is translucent and light yellow to yellow in color. Each fruit can have 10 to 12 flat light brown seeds about in width and enclosed in gelatinous aril. Once removed from the fruit, they lose viability within a few days.

Like the closely related bilimbi, there are two main types of carambola: the small sour (or tart) type and the larger sweet type. The sour varieties have a higher oxalic acid content than the sweet type. A number of cultivars have been developed in recent years. The most common cultivars grown commercially include the sweet types &quot;Arkin&quot; (Florida), &quot;Yang Tao&quot; (Taiwan), &quot;Ma fueng&quot; (Thailand), &quot;Maha&quot; (Malaysia), and &quot;Demak&quot; (Indonesia) and the sour types &quot;Golden Star&quot;, &quot;Newcomb&quot;, &quot;Star King&quot;, and &quot;Thayer&quot; (all from Florida). Some of the sour varieties like &quot;Golden Star&quot; can become sweet if allowed to ripen.

===Common names===
Carambola is known by many names across its regions of cultivation, including &quot;khế&quot; in Vietnam, &quot;balimbing&quot; in the Philippines, &quot;belimbing&quot; in Indonesia and Malaysia, &quot;ma fen&quot; in China, &quot;kamaranga&quot; in India, and &quot;carambolo&quot; in Spanish-speaking countries.

==Culinary==
The entire fruit is edible, including the slightly waxy skin. The flesh is crunchy, firm, and extremely juicy. It does not contain fibers and has a texture similar in consistency to that of grapes. Carambolas are best consumed shortly after they ripen when they are yellow with a light shade of green, or just after all traces of green have disappeared. They will also have brown ridges at the edges and feel firm. Fruits picked while still slightly green will turn yellow in storage at room temperature, but will not increase in sugar content. Overripe carambola will be yellow with brown spots and can become blander in taste and soggier in consistency.

Ripe sweet type carambolas are sweet without being overwhelming as they rarely have more than 4% sugar content. They have a tart, sour undertone, and an oxalic acid odor. The taste is difficult to match, but it has been compared to a mix of apple, pear, grape, and citrus family fruits. Unripe star fruits are firmer and sour, and taste like green apples.

Ripe carambolas may also be used in cooking. In Southeast Asia, they are usually stewed in cloves and sugar, sometimes with apples. In China, they are cooked with fish. In Australia, they may be cooked as a vegetable, pickled, or made into jams. In Jamaica they are sometimes dried.

Unripe and sour type carambolas can be mixed with other chopped spices to make relishes in Australia. In the Philippines, unripe carambolas are eaten dipped in rock salt. In Thailand, they are cooked together with shrimp.

The juice from carambolas is also used in iced drinks, particularly the juice of the sour varieties. In the Philippines, they can be used as a seasoning. In India, the juice is bottled for drinking.

===Nutrition===
Raw carambola is 91% water, 7% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat (table). A 100-gram reference amount of raw fruit supplies of food energy and a rich content of vitamin C (41% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant content (table).

==Health risks==
Carambolas contain caramboxin and oxalic acid. Both substances are harmful to individuals suffering from kidney failure, kidney stones, or those under kidney dialysis treatment. Consumption by those with kidney failure can produce hiccups, vomiting, nausea, mental confusion, and sometimes death. Caramboxin is a neurotoxin which is structurally similar to phenylalanine, and is a glutamatergic agonist.

===Drug interactions===
Like the grapefruit, carambola is considered to be a potent inhibitor of seven cytochrome P450 isoforms. These enzymes are significant in the first-pass elimination of many medications, and, thus, the consumption of carambola or its juice in combination with certain prescription medications can significantly increase their effective dosage within the body.

==Cultivation==
The carambola is a tropical and subtropical fruit which can be grown at elevations up to . It prefers full sun exposure, but requires enough humidity and annual rainfall of at least . It does not have a soil type preference, but will thrive in loam and requires good drainage. Moderate irrigation supports its growth during dry seasons. Heavy rains may inhibit fruit production.

Carambola trees are planted at least from each other and typically are fertilized three times a year. The tree grows rapidly and typically produces fruit at four or five years of age. The large amount of rain during spring actually reduces the amount of fruit, but, in ideal conditions, carambola can produce from of fruit a year. The carambola tree flowers throughout the year, with main fruiting seasons from April to June and October to December in Malaysia, for example, but fruiting also occurs at other times in some other locales, such as South Florida.

Growth and leaf responses of container-grown &#x27;Arkin&#x27; carambola (&quot;Averrhoa carambola&quot; L.) trees to long-term exposure of 25%, 50%, or 100% sunlight showed that shading increased rachis length and leaflet area, decreased leaflet thickness, and produced more horizontal branch orientation. 

Major pests are carambola fruit flies, fruit moths, ants, and birds. Crops are also susceptible to frost.

Top producers of carambola in the world market include Australia, Guyana, India, Israel, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and the United States. Malaysia is a global leader in star fruit production by volume and ships the product widely to Asia and Europe. Due to concerns over pests and pathogens, however, whole star fruits cannot yet be imported to the US from Malaysia under current United States Department of Agriculture regulations. In the United States, carambolas are grown in tropical and semitropical areas, including parts of Florida and Hawaii.

In the United States, commercial cultivation and broad consumer acceptance of the fruit only date to the 1970s, attributable to Morris Arkin, a backyard horticulturalist, in Coral Gables, Florida. The &#x27;Arkin&#x27; variety represented 98% of the acreage in South Florida in the early 21st century.

==In popular culture==

The trees are also grown as ornamentals for their abundant brightly colored and unusually shaped fruits, as well as for their attractive dark green leaves and their lavender to pink flowers.

Like the bilimbi, the juice of the more acidic sour types can be used to clean rusty or tarnished metal (especially brass) as well as bleach rust stains from cloth. They may also be used as a mordant in dyeing.

The farming video game &quot;Stardew Valley&quot; allows the player to cultivate and grow carambola, in this setting known as &quot;starfruit&quot;. They are the most valuable crop in the game. The in-game icon erroneously depicts the fruit as resembling its real-life cross-section, and the plant itself as a single-harvest crop instead of a tree.

The Filipino word for the starfruit, &quot;balimbing&quot;, due to its many-faced shape, has acquired the meaning in Philippine political discourse of a turncoat, someone who switches political allegiances not out of principle but for their own self-interest.

<text>The Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (; less formally the Vietnamese Government or the Government of Vietnam, ) is the cabinet and the central executive body of the state administration of Vietnam. The members of the Government are appointed by the President of Vietnam on the advice of the Prime Minister of Vietnam and approved by the National Assembly. The Government is led by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), which is headed by the CPV general secretary, often seen as the highest political post in Vietnam.

The current government is the Government of Phạm Minh Chính (also known as the Government of the 15th National Assembly), which was established in accordance with the 2013 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Throughout history, each state administration of Vietnam had developed its own [[Cabinet (government)|government cabinet]].

==Names==
After the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on 2 September 1945, based on the 1946 Constitution, the executive branch was called the Government (&quot;Chính phủ&quot;). The Government was headed by the president, which was the second highest position in Vietnam. Under the president was the Cabinet, which was headed by the prime minister (&quot;Thủ tướng&quot;).

From 1959 to 1980, based on the 1959 Constitution, the executive branch was named as the Council of Government (&quot;Hội đồng Chính phủ&quot;). The Council of Government was headed by the prime minister.

From 1980 to 1992, based on the 1980 Constitution, the executive branch was called the Council of Ministers (&quot;Hội đồng Bộ trưởng&quot;). The Council of Ministers was headed by the chairman (equivalent to the prime minister).

From 1992 onwards, based on the 1992 Constitution the executive branch was renamed as the Government (&quot;Chính phủ&quot;). The Government is headed by the prime minister.

==Term==
Based on The 2013 Constitution, the term of the Government follows the term of the National Assembly. At the expiration of the term of the National Assembly, the Government shall remain in office until a new Government is elected by the succeeding National Assembly.

==History==

===Council of Ministers (1980–1992)===
The Vietnamese Council of Ministers (&quot;Hội đồng Bộ trưởng&quot;) was entrusted by the 1980 Constitution with managing and implementing the governmental activities of the state. It is described in that document as &quot;the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the highest executive state body of the highest body of state authority.&quot; It is accountable to the National Assembly of Vietnam, and, more directly, to the Vietnamese Council of State when the National Assembly is not in session. Its duties include submitting draft laws, decrees, and other bills to the National Assembly and the Council of State; drafting state plans and budgets and implementing them following the National Assembly&#x27;s approval; managing the development of the national economy; organising national defence activities and assuring the preparedness of the armed forces; and organising and managing the state&#x27;s foreign relations. Its membership includes a chairman, vice-chairman, cabinet ministers, and the heads of state committees, whose terms of office coincide with that of the National Assembly. The Council of Ministers includes its own standing committee, which serves to co-ordinate and mobilise the council&#x27;s activities. In 1986 the standing committee was expanded from ten to thirteen members.

Each ministry is headed by a minister, who is assisted by two to twelve deputy ministers. The number and functions of the ministries are not prescribed in the Constitution, but in 1987 there were twenty-three ministries and a number of other specialised commissions and departments. In an apparent response to the call by the Sixth National Party Congress in 1986 for a streamlined bureaucracy, several ministries were merged. The former ministries of agriculture, food, and food industry were joined in a newly created Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry. The ministries of power and mines were merged to form the Ministry of Energy, and a newly created Ministry of Labour, War Invalids, and Social Welfare consolidated the duties of three former ministries. The addition of two new ministerial bodies also resulted from the 6th National Party Congress: a Ministry of Information to replace the Vietnam Radio and Television Commission, and a mission for Economic Relations with Foreign Countries to act as a co-ordinating body for foreign aid.

===Government (since 1992)===
Since 1992 the executive branch of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is officially named the Government (&quot;Chính phủ&quot;). The current Government of Vietnam consists of 18 ministries, 4 ministry-level agencies and 8 other government-dependent agencies.

==Composition==
The Government is headed by a prime minister (&quot;Thủ tướng&quot;) and four deputy prime ministers (&quot;Phó Thủ tướng&quot;).

There are 14 ministries (&quot;Bộ&quot;); each is headed by a minister (&quot;Bộ trưởng&quot;):

* Ministry of Foreign Affairs (&quot;Bộ Ngoại giao&quot;)
* Ministry of Defence (&quot;Bộ Quốc phòng&quot;)
* Ministry of Public Security (&quot;Bộ Công an&quot;) 
* Ministry of Home Affairs (&quot;Bộ Nội vụ&quot;)
* Ministry of Justice (&quot;Bộ Tư pháp&quot;)
* Ministry of Finance (&quot;Bộ Tài chính&quot;)
* Ministry of Industry and Trade (&quot;Bộ Công Thương&quot;) 
* Ministry of Agriculture and Environment (&quot;Bộ Nông nghiệp và Môi trường&quot;)
* Ministry of Construction (&quot;Bộ Xây dựng&quot;)
* Ministry of Education and Training (&quot;Bộ Giáo dục và Đào tạo&quot;)
* Ministry of Science and Technology (&quot;Bộ Khoa học và Công nghệ&quot;)
* Ministry of Health (&quot;Bộ Y tế&quot;)
* Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (&quot;Bộ Văn hóa, Thể thao và Du lịch&quot;)
* Ministry of Ethnic Minority Affairs (&quot;Bộ Dân tộc và Tôn giáo&quot;)
Three ministry-level agencies:
* Government Office (&quot;Văn phòng Chính phủ&quot;), headed by a chief (&quot;Chủ nhiệm&quot;)
* Government Inspectorate (&quot;Thanh tra Chính phủ&quot;), headed by an inspector-general (&quot;Tổng Thanh tra&quot;)
* State Bank of Vietnam (&quot;Ngân hàng Nhà nước Việt Nam&quot;), headed by a governor (&quot;Thống đốc&quot;)

Five other government-dependent agencies:
* Vietnam Television or VTV (&quot;Đài Truyền hình Việt Nam&quot;), headed by a general director (&quot;Tổng Giám đốc&quot;)
* Vietnam News Agency or TTXVN (&quot;Thông tấn xã Việt Nam&quot;), headed by a general director (&quot;Tổng Giám đốc&quot;)
* Voice of Vietnam or VOV (&quot;Đài Tiếng nói Việt Nam&quot;), headed by a general director (&quot;Tổng Giám đốc&quot;)
* Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences (&quot;Viện Hàn lâm Khoa học Xã hội Việt Nam&quot;), headed by a chairperson (&quot;Chủ tịch&quot;)
* Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (&quot;Viện Hàn lâm Khoa học và Công nghệ Việt Nam&quot;), headed by a chairperson (&quot;Chủ tịch&quot;)

In addition, the Government of Vietnam also establishes many national committees (&quot;Ủy ban Quốc gia&quot;) when needed. The national committees are not separate political entities or ministries; instead they are composed of deputy prime ministers, ministers and deputy ministers in appropriate fields. The national committees act as advisor bodies to the prime minister on social and economic issues, and coordinate actions between many ministries and agencies. Therefore, the national committees do not have any executive powers. Currently there are nine national committees; each is headed by a chairman (&quot;Chủ tịch&quot;):
* National Committee for Renovation of Education and Training (&quot;Ủy ban Quốc gia Đổi mới Giáo dục và Đào tạo&quot;)
* National Committee for Digital Transformation (&quot;Ủy ban Quốc gia về Chuyển đổi số&quot;)
* National Committee for Climate Change (&quot;Ủy ban Quốc gia về Biến đổi Khí hậu&quot;)
* National Committee for Traffic Safety (&quot;Ủy ban An toàn Giao thông Quốc gia&quot;)
* National Committee for Prevention of AIDS and Prevention of Narcotics and Prostitutions (&quot;Ủy ban Quốc gia Phòng chống AIDS và Phòng chống Tệ nạn Ma túy, Mại dâm&quot;)
* National Committee for Search and Rescue (&quot;Ủy ban Quốc gia Tìm kiếm Cứu nạn&quot;)
* National Committee for Security of Civil Aviation (&quot;Ủy ban An ninh Hàng không Dân dụng Quốc gia&quot;)
* National Committee for Elderly (&quot;Ủy ban Quốc gia về Người cao tuổi&quot;)
* National Committee for International Economic Cooperation (&quot;Ủy ban Quốc gia về Hợp tác Kinh tế Quốc tế&quot;)

==Current government ==
Incumbent Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính, who had replaced Nguyễn Xuân Phúc as prime minister since 5 April 2021, was re-elected on 26 July 2021 following a 484–0 vote by the National Assembly.

After taking the oath of office on the same day, Chính nominated 26 people to serve in his Cabinet, including 4 deputy prime ministers (1 fewer than the previous term), 18 ministers, and 4 heads of ministerial-level agencies. The lineup was approved by the National Assembly on 28 July 2021. Cabinet members are expected to serve a five-year renewable term ending before the 2026 election.

The heads of other government-dependent agencies are appointed by the Prime Minister without approval by the National Assembly. Usually there is no term limit on the leaders of those agencies. The current heads of the government-dependent agencies are:
* General Director of Vietnam Television: Lê Ngọc Quang
* General Director of Vietnam News Agency: Vũ Việt Trang
* General Director of Voice of Vietnam: Đỗ Tiến Sỹ
* Chairman of Commission for the Management of State Capital at Enterprises: Nguyễn Hoàng Anh
* President of Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics: Prof. Nguyễn Xuân Thắng
* Acting Chief of Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum Management: Maj.Gen. Bùi Hải Sơn
* General Director of Vietnam Social Security: Nguyễn Thế Mạnh
* Chairman of Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences: Phan Chí Hiếu
* Chairman of Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology: Prof. Châu Văn Minh

<text>Venezuela is a federal presidential republic. The chief executive is the President of Venezuela who is both head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised by the President. Legislative power is vested in the National Assembly of Venezuela. Supreme judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice.

==Legislative power ==
Legislation can be initiated by the executive branch, the legislative branch (either a committee of the National Assembly or three members of the latter), the judicial branch, the citizen branch (ombudsman, public prosecutor, and controller general) or a public petition signed by no fewer than 0.1% of registered voters.

The voting age is 18, and voting is not compulsory.

Former ministries include the Venezuelan Ministry of Infrastructure, which became the &quot;Ministry of Public Works and Housing&quot; and was split into the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Ministry of Housing &amp; Habitat in June 2010. The Ministry of Popular Economy became the &quot;Ministry of Communal Economy&quot; in 2007, and was merged into the Ministry of Communes and Social Protection on 3 March 2009, along with the Ministry of Participation and Social Protection.

==Judicial branch==
The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, which may meet either in specialized chambers (of which there are six) or in plenary session. The 32 justices are appointed by the National Assembly and serve 12-year terms. The judicial branch also consists of lower courts, including district courts, municipal courts, and courts of the first instance.

==Citizens branch==

The citizens branch consists of three components the prosecutor general (&quot;fiscal general&quot;), the Defender of the People (an ombudsman), and the comptroller general. These officials of state, in addition to fulfilling their specific functions, also act collectively as the &quot;Republican Moral Council&quot; to submit to the Supreme Tribunal actions they believe are illegal, particularly those which violate the Constitution. The holders of the &quot;citizen power&quot; offices are appointed for seven-year terms by the National Assembly.

<text>Egyptology (from &quot;Egypt&quot; and Greek , &quot;&quot;; ) is the scientific study of ancient Egypt. The topics studied include ancient Egyptian history, language, literature, religion, architecture and art from the 5th millennium BC until the end of its native religious practices in the 4th century AD.

==History==
===First explorers===
The earliest explorers of ancient Egypt were the ancient Egyptians themselves. Inspired by a dream he had, Thutmose IV led an excavation of the Great Sphinx of Giza and inscribed a description of the dream on the Dream Stele. Less than two centuries later, Prince Khaemweset, fourth son of Ramesses II, would gain fame for identifying and restoring historic buildings, tombs and temples, including pyramids; and has subsequently been described as the first Egyptologist.

===Classical Antiquity===
Some of the first historical accounts of Egypt were given by Herodotus, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus and the largely lost work of Manetho, an Egyptian priest, during the reign of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II in the 3rd century BC. The Ptolemies were very interested in the work of the ancient Egyptians, and many of the Egyptian monuments, including the pyramids, were restored by them. The Ptolemies also built many new temples in the Egyptian style. The Romans also carried out restoration work in Egypt.

===Middle Ages===
Throughout the Middle Ages, travelers on pilgrimages to the Holy Land would occasionally detour to visit sites in Egypt. Destinations would include Cairo and its environs, where the Holy Family was thought to have fled, and the great Pyramids, which were thought to be Joseph&#x27;s Granaries, built by the Hebrew patriarch to store grain during the years of plenty. A number of their accounts (&quot;Itineraria&quot;) have survived and offer insights into conditions in their respective time periods.
Medieval Islamic scholars studied Ancient Egypt and made attempts at translating Ancient Egyptian texts into Arabic. These Arabic scholars were key in preserving and sharing knowledge about Egypt, connecting ancient civilizations to the Islamic world. Abdul Latif al-Baghdadi, a teacher at Cairo&#x27;s Al-Azhar University in the 13th century, wrote detailed descriptions of ancient Egyptian monuments. Similarly, the 15th-century Egyptian historian al-Maqrizi wrote detailed accounts of Egyptian antiquities.

===European explorers===
European exploration and travel writings of ancient Egypt commenced in the 13th century, with only occasional detours into what could be considered a scientific approach, notably by Claude Sicard, Benoît de Maillet, Frederic Louis Norden and Richard Pococke.

In the early 17th century, John Greaves measured the pyramids, having inspected the broken Obelisk of Domitian in Rome, then intended for Lord Arundel&#x27;s collection in London. He went on to publish the illustrated &quot;Pyramidographia&quot; in 1646.

The Jesuit scientist-priest Athanasius Kircher was perhaps the first to hint at the phonetic importance of Egyptian hieroglyphs, demonstrating Coptic as a vestige of early Egyptian, for which he is considered a founder of Egyptology.

===Modern Egyptology===


Egyptology&#x27;s modern history begins with the invasion of Egypt by Napoleon Bonaparte in the late 18th century. The Rosetta Stone was discovered in 1799. The study of many aspects of ancient Egypt became more scientifically oriented with the publication of &quot;Mémoires sur l&#x27;Égypte&quot; in 1800 and the more comprehensive &quot;Description de l&#x27;Egypte&quot; between 1809 and 1829. These recorded Egyptian flora, fauna, and history—making numerous ancient Egyptian source materials available to Europeans for the first time. The British captured Egypt from the French and gained the Rosetta Stone in 1801, the Greek script of which was translated by 1803. In 1822, the corresponding Egyptian hieroglyphs were deciphered by Jean-François Champollion, marking the beginning of modern Egyptology. With increasing knowledge of Egyptian writing, the study of ancient Egypt was able to proceed with greater academic rigour. Champollion, Thomas Young and Ippolito Rosellini were some of the first Egyptologists of wide acclaim. The German Karl Richard Lepsius was an early participant in the investigations of Egypt—mapping, excavating and recording several sites.

English Egyptologist Flinders Petrie (1853–1942) introduced archaeological techniques of field preservation, recording, and excavation to the field. Many highly educated amateurs also travelled to Egypt, including women such as Harriet Martineau and Florence Nightingale. Both of these left accounts of their travels, which revealed learned familiarity with all of the latest European Egyptology. Howard Carter&#x27;s 1922 discovery of the tomb of 18th Dynasty King Tutankhamun brought a greater understanding of Egyptian relics and wide acclaim to the field.

In the modern era, the Ministry of State for Antiquities controls excavation permits for Egyptologists to conduct their work. The field can now use geophysical methods and other applications of modern sensing techniques.

In June 2000, the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology (IEASM), directed by Franck Goddio, in cooperation with the Egyptian Ministry for Antiquities discovered the ancient sunken city of Thonis-Heracleion in today&#x27;s Abu Qir Bay. The statues of a colossal King and Queen are on display at the Grand Egyptian Museum. Other discovered artefacts are exhibited at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina and Alexandria National Museum. The excavations are documented through several publications

In March 2017, the Egyptian-German team of archaeologists unearthed an eight-meter 3,000-year-old statue that included a head and a torso thought to depict Pharaoh Ramses II. According to Khaled El-Enany, the Egyptian Antiquities Minister, the statue was more likely thought to be King Psammetich I. Excavators also revealed an 80 cm-long part of a limestone statue of Pharaoh Seti II while excavating the site.

In August 2017, archaeologists from the Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of five mud-brick tombs at Bir esh-Shaghala, dating back nearly 2,000 years. Researchers also revealed worn masks gilded with gold, several large jars and a piece of pottery with unsolved ancient Egyptian writing on it.

In November 2017 (25 October 2000), the Egyptian mission in cooperation with the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology announced the discovery of 2,000-year-old three sunken shipwrecks dated back to the Roman Era in Alexandria&#x27;s Abu Qir Bay.

The sunken cargo included a royal head of crystal perhaps belong to the commander of the Roman armies of &quot;Antonio&quot;, three gold coins from the era of Emperor Octavius Augustus, large wooden planks and pottery vessels.

In April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the head of the bust of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius at the Temple of Kom Ombo in Aswan during work to protect the site from groundwater.

In April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the shrine of god Osiris- Ptah Neb, dating back to the 25th dynasty in the Temple of Karnak in Luxor. According to archaeologist Essam Nagy, the material remains from the area contained clay pots, the lower part of a sitting statue and part of a stone panel showing an offering table filled with a sheep and a goose which were the symbols of the god Amun.

In July 2018, German-Egyptian researchers&#x27; team head by Ramadan Badry Hussein of the University of Tübingen reported the discovery of an extremely rare gilded burial mask that probably dates from the Saite-Persian period in a partly damaged wooden coffin in Saqqara. The last time a similar mask was found was in 1939. The eyes were covered with obsidian, calcite, and black hued gemstone possibly onyx. &quot;The finding of this mask could be called a sensation. Very few masks of precious metal have been preserved to the present day, because the tombs of most Ancient Egyptian dignitaries were looted in ancient times.&quot; said Hussein.

In July 2018, archaeologists led by Zeinab Hashish announced the discovery of a 2,000-year-old 30-ton black granite sarcophagus in Alexandria. It contained three damaged skeletons in red-brown sewage water. According to archaeologist Mostafa Waziri, the skeletons looked like a family burial with a middle-aged woman and two men. Researchers also revealed a small gold artifact and three thin sheets of gold.

In September 2018, a sandstone sphinx statue  was discovered at the temple of Kom Ombo. The statue, measuring approximately 28 cm (11 in) in width and 38 cm (15 in) in height, likely dates to the Ptolemaic Dynasty.

In September 2018, several dozen cache of mummies dating 2,000 years back were found in Saqqara by a team of Polish archaeologists led by Kamil Kuraszkiewicz from the Faculty of Oriental Studies of the University of Warsaw.

In November 2018, an Egyptian archaeological mission located seven ancient Egyptian tombs at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara containing a collection of scarab and cat mummies dating back to the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties. Three of the tombs were used for cats, some dating back more than 6,000 years, while one of four other sarcophagi was unsealed. With the remains of cat mummies were unearthed gilded and 100 wooden statues of cats and one in bronze dedicated to the cat goddess Bastet. In addition, funerary items dating back to the 12th Dynasty were found besides the skeletal remains of cats.

In mid-December 2018, the Egyptian government announced the discovery at Saqqara of a previously unknown 4,400-year-old tomb, containing paintings and more than fifty sculptures. It belongs to Wahtye, a high-ranking priest who served under King Neferirkare Kakai during the Fifth Dynasty. The tomb also contains four shafts that lead to a sarcophagus below.

According to the Al-Ahram, in January 2019, archaeologists headed by Mostafa Waziri revealed a collection of 20 tombs dated back to the Second Intermediate Period in Kom Al-Khelgan. The burials contained the remains of animals, amulets, and scarabs carved from faience, round and oval pots with handholds, flint knives, broken and burned pottery. All burials included skulls and skeletons in the bending position and were not very well-preserved.

In April 2019, archaeologists discovered 35 mummified remains of Egyptians in a tomb in Aswan. Italian archaeologist Patrizia Piacentini, professor of Egyptology at the University of Milan, and Khaled El-Enany, the Egyptian minister of antiquities reported that the tomb where the remains of ancient men, women and children were found, dates back to the Greco-Roman period between 332 BC and 395 AD. While the findings assumed belonging to a mother and a child were well preserved, others had suffered major destruction. Beside the mummies, artefacts including painted funerary masks, vases of bitumen used in mummification, pottery and wooden figurines were revealed. Thanks to the hieroglyphics on the tomb, it was detected that the tomb belongs to a tradesman named Tjit.

On 13 April 2019, an expedition led by a member of the Czech Institute of Egyptology, Mohamed Megahed, discovered a 4,000-year-old tomb near Egypt&#x27;s Saqqara Necropolis in Saqqara. Archaeologists confirmed that the tomb belonged to an influential person named Khuwy, who lived in Egypt during the 5th Dynasty. &quot;The L-shaped Khuwy tomb starts with a small corridor heading downwards into an antechamber and from there a larger chamber with painted reliefs depicting the tomb owner seated at an offerings table&quot;, reported Megahed. Some paintings maintained their brightness over a long time in the tomb. Mainly made of white limestone bricks, the tomb had a tunnel entrance generally typical for pyramids. Archaeologists say that there might be a connection between Khuwy and pharaoh because the mausoleum was found near the pyramid of Egyptian Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi, who ruled during that time.

In July 2019, ancient granite columns and a smaller Greek temple, treasure-laden ships, along with bronze coins from the reign of Ptolemy II, pottery dating back to the third and fourth centuries BC were found at the sunken city of Heracleion. The investigations were conducted by Egyptian and European divers led by underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio. They also uncovered the ruins of the city&#x27;s main temple off of Egypt&#x27;s north coast.

In September 2019, archaeologists announced the discovery of a 2,200-year-old temple believed to belong to the Ptolemy IV Philosopher of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Kom Shakau village of Tama township. Researchers also revealed limestone walls carved with inscriptions of Hapi, the Nile god, and inscriptions with fragments of text featuring the name of Ptolemy IV.

In May 2020, Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission head by Esther Ponce uncovered a unique cemetery dating back to the 26th Dynasty (so-called the El-Sawi era) at the site of ancient Oxyrhynchus. Archaeologists found tombstones, bronze coins, small crosses, and clay seals inside eight Roman-era tombs with domed and unmarked roofs.

On 3 October 2020, Khalid el-Anany, Egypt&#x27;s tourism and antiquities minister announced the discovery of at least 59 sealed sarcophagi with mummies more than 2,600 years old in Saqqara. Archaeologists also revealed the 20 statues of Ptah-Soker and a carved 35-centimeter tall bronze statue of god Nefertem.

On 19 October 2020, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery of more than 2,500 years of colorful, sealed sarcophagi in Saqqara. The archaeological team unearthed gilded, wooden statues and more than 80 coffins.

In November 2020, archaeologists unearthed more than 100 delicately painted wooden coffins and 40 funeral statues. The sealed, wooden coffins, some containing mummies, date as far back as 2,500 years. Other artifacts discovered include funeral masks, canopic jars and amulets. According to Khaled el-Anany, tourism and antiquities minister, the items date back to the Ptolemaic dynasty. One of the coffins was opened and a mummy was scanned with an X-ray, determining it was most likely a man about the age of 40.

In January 2021, the Tourism and Antiquities Ministry announced the discovery of more than 50 wooden sarcophagi in 52 burial shafts which date back to the New Kingdom period and a 13 ft-long papyrus that contains texts from the Book of the Dead. Archaeologists led by Zahi Hawass also found the funerary temple of Naert and warehouses made of bricks in Saqqara.

In January 2021, Egyptian-Dominican researchers led by Kathleen Martinez have announced the discovery of 2,000-year-old ancient tombs with golden tongues dating to the Greek and Roman periods at Taposiris Magna. The team also unearthed gold leaf amulets in the form of tongues placed for speaking with God Osiris afterlife. The mummies were depicted in different forms: one of them was wearing a crown, decorated with horns, and the cobra snake at the forehead and the other was depicted with gilded decorations representing the wide necklace.

A team of archaeologists led by Zahi Hawass also found the funerary temple of Naert or Narat and warehouses made of bricks in Saqqara. Researchers also revealed that Narat&#x27;s name engraved on a fallen obelisk near the main entrance. Previously unknown to researchers, Naert was a wife of Teti, the first king of the sixth dynasty.

In February 2021, archaeologists from the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery of a Ptolemaic period temple, a Roman fort, an early Coptic church and an inscription written in hieratic script at an archaeological site called Shiha Fort in Aswan. According to Mostafa Waziri, the crumbling temple was decorated with palm leaf carvings and an incomplete sandstone panel that described a Roman emperor. According to researcher Abdel Badie, generally, the church with about 2.1 meters width contained oven that were used to bake pottery, four rooms, a long hall, stairs, and stone tiles.

In April 2021, Egyptian archeologists announced the discovery of 110 burial tombs at the Koum el-Khulgan archeological site in Dakahlia Governorate. 68 oval-shaped tombs of them dated back to the Predynastic Period and 37 rectangular-shaped tombs were from Second Intermediate Period. Rest of them dated back to the Naqada III period. The tombs also contained the remains of adults and a baby (buried in a jar), a group of ovens, stoves, remnants of mud-brick foundations, funerary equipment, cylindrical, pear-shaped vessels and a bowl with geometric designs.

In September 2021, archaeologists announce the discovery of ritualistic tools used in religious rituals at the ancient site of Tel al-Fara in the Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate. Remains included a limestone pillar depicting goddess Hathor, some incense burners with the head of the god Horus. Hossam Ghanim, said: &quot;The mission also discovered a huge building of polished limestone from the inside, representing a well for holy water used in daily rituals&quot;.

In May 2022, the discovery of the nearly 4,300-year-old tomb of an ancient Egyptian high-ranked person who handled royal, sealed documents of pharaoh was announced at Saqqara, Egypt. According to University of Warsaw&#x27;s Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, the elaborately decorated tomb belonged to a man named Mehtjetju who served as a priest and an inspector of the royal property. Kamil O. Kuraszkiewicz, expedition director stated that Mehtjetju most likely lived at about the same time, at some point during the reigns of the first three rulers of the Sixth Dynasty: Teti, Userkare and Pepy I.

In June 2022, archaeologists from The Cairo Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of an alabaster bust of Alexander the Great as well as molds and other materials for creating amulets for warriors and for statues of Alexander the Great.

In July 2022, archaeologists from the Prague&#x27;s Charles University led by Miroslav Bárta discovered the robbed tomb of an ancient Egyptian military official named Wahibre-mery-Neith and a scarab in Giza&#x27;s Abusir necropolis 12 km southeast of the Pyramids of Giza. He commanded battalions of non-local soldiers and likely lived in the late 26th and early 27th dynasties, around 500 BC, according to the Egyptian Antiquities Ministry. The tomb&#x27;s main well was about 6 meters deep and it was divided into separate parts by narrow bridges cut into the natural rock. Inside the main well there was a smaller and deeper shaft which contained two sarcophagi one inside the other where Wahibre-mery-Neith was buried. The external sarcophagus was made of white limestone while the internal coffin was made out of basalt rock measures 2.30 meters long and 1.98 meters wide. The inner sarcophagus contained an inscription from the 72nd chapter of the Egyptian Book of Dead said Marslav Barta.

In August 2022, archaeologists from the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw announced the discovery of a 4,500-year-old temple dedicated to the Egyptian sun god Ra. The recently discovered sun temple was made from mud bricks and was about 60 meters long by 20 m wide. According to Massimiliano Nuzzolo, co-director of the excavation, storage rooms and other rooms may have been served for cultic purposes and the walls of the building were all plastered in black and white. The L-shaped entrance portico had two limestone columns and was partly made of white limestone. Dozens of well-preserved beer jars and several well-made and red-lined vessels, seal impressions, including seals of the pharaohs who ruled during the fifth and sixth dynasties were also uncovered. One of the earliest seals might belonged to pharaoh Shepseskare, who ruled Egypt before Nyuserre.

===Bias in Egyptology===

Various scholars have highlighted the role of colonial racism in shaping the attitudes of early Egyptologists, and criticised the continued over-representation of North American and European perspectives in the field over African ones. Cheikh Anta Diop in his work, &quot;The African Origin of Civilization&quot; argued that the prevailing views in Egyptology were driven by biased scholarship and colonial attitudes. Similarly, Bruce Trigger wrote that early modern scholarship on the Nile Valley populations had been &quot;marred by a confusion of race, language, and culture and by an accompanying racism&quot;.

British Africanist Basil Davidson wrote in 1995 that a number of unsatisfactory labels are often attached—such as &quot;Bushmen&quot;, &quot;Negro&quot;, or &quot;Negroid&quot;—to indigenous, African populations. He was also critical of the Hamitic hypothesis and other categorisations of &quot;North African stocks&quot; as &quot;white&quot;. Davidson further added that the &quot;ancient Egyptians belonged, that is, not to any specific Egyptian region or Near Eastern heritage but to that wide community of peoples who lived between the Red Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, shared a common &quot;Saharan-Sudanese culture&quot;, and drew their reinforcements from the same great source, even though, as time went by, they also absorbed a number of wanderers from the Near East&quot;.

In 2018, Stuart Tyson Smith argued that a common practice among Egyptologists was to &quot;divorce Egypt from its proper northeast African context, instead framing it as fundamentally part of a Near Eastern or &quot;Mediterranean&quot; economic, social and political sphere, hardly African at all or at best a crossroad between the Near East, the eastern Mediterranean and Africa, which carries with it the implication that it is ultimately not really part of Africa&quot;. He explicitly criticised the view that ancient Egypt was clearly &#x27;in Africa&#x27; it was not so clearly &#x27;of Africa&#x27; as reflecting &quot;long-standing Egyptological biases&quot;. He concluded that the interrelated cultural features shared between northeast African dynamic and Pharaonic Egypt are not &quot;survivals&quot; or coincidence, but shared traditions with common origins in the deep past&quot;.

In 2021, Marc Van De Mieroop stated that &quot;It was only recently that traditional scholarship started to acknowledge the African background of Egyptian culture, partly in response to world history&#x27;s aim to replace dominant western-centered narratives with others than focused more on the contributions of other regions, including Africa. At the same time, primarily African diaspora communities wanted the continent&#x27;s ancient history to be approached outside a Eurocentric context, and insisted, for example, on the use of ancient Egyptian term &quot;kemet&quot; instead of the European one&quot;.

In 2022, Andrea Manzo argued that early Egyptologists had situated the origins of dynastic Egypt within a &quot;broad Hamitic horizon that characterised several regions of Africa&quot; and that these views had continued to dominate in the second half of the twentieth century. Manzo stated more recent studies had &quot;pointed out the relevance of African elements to the rise of Egyptian culture, following earlier suggestions on Egyptian kingship and religion by Henri Frankfort&quot; which countered the traditional view that considered Egypt &quot;more closely linked to the Near East than to the rest of Africa&quot;.

In 2023, Christopher Ehret outlined that the previous two centuries of Western scholarship had presented Egypt as an &quot;offshoot of earlier Middle Eastern developments&quot;. Although, he acknowledged that recent generations of scholars in Egypt and Nubia have been &quot;uncovering extensive new bodies of evidence&quot; which have dispelled older assumptions. However, Ehret continued to argue that these old ideas had influenced the attitudes of scholars in other disciplines such as genetics.

==Academic discipline==
Egyptology was established as an academic discipline through the research of Ippolito Rosellini in Italy, Emmanuel de Rougé in France, Samuel Birch in England, and Heinrich Brugsch in Germany. In 1880, Flinders Petrie, another British Egyptologist, revolutionised the field of archaeology through controlled and scientifically recorded excavations. Petrie&#x27;s work determined that Egyptian culture dated back as early as 4500 BC. The British Egypt Exploration Fund founded in 1882 and other Egyptologists promoted Petrie&#x27;s methods. Other scholars worked on producing a hieroglyphic dictionary, developing a Demotic lexicon, and establishing an outline of ancient Egyptian history.

In the United States, the founding of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago and the expedition of James Henry Breasted to Egypt and Nubia established Egyptology as a legitimate field of study. In 1924, Breasted also started the Epigraphic Survey to make and publish accurate copies of monuments. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the University of Pennsylvania; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Brooklyn Institute of Fine Arts; and the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University also conducted 
excavations in Egypt, expanding American collections.

In 1999, under the leadership of Prof. Ioannis Liritzis, Egyptology was introduced as an academic discipline in Greece, specifically in the Department of Mediterranean Studies (DMS) of the University of the Aegean. Beginning in 1998, Prof. Liritzis has collaborated with Egyptian authorities to encourage research, fieldwork, and education, all supported by Greek and European funding. The Hellenic-Egyptian relationship in Egyptological studies has been successful, largely due to Prof. Liritzis, and the result is a plethora of publications and interactions.

Some universities and colleges offer degrees in Egyptology. In the United States, these include the University of Chicago, Brown University, New York University, Yale University and Indiana University - Bloomington, and California State University San Bernardino. There are also many programmes in the United Kingdom, including those at the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, Swansea University, the University of Liverpool, the University of Manchester, and the University of London. While Egyptology is widely studied in continental Europe, only two--Leiden University and Uppsala University—offer degree programs taught in English.

The professional organisation of scholars in Egyptology is the International Association of Egyptologists (IAE), under whose auspices an &quot;International Congress of Egyptologists&quot; (ICE) is held every four years.

Societies for Egyptology include:
* The Society for the Study of Ancient Egypt
* The Society for the Study of Ancient Egyptian Antiquities, Canada
* Sussex Egyptology Society Online
* Egypt Exploration Society

According to UCLA, the standard text that scholars referenced for studies of Egyptology was for three decades or more, the &quot;Lexikon der Ägyptologie&quot; (LÄ). The first volume published in 1975 (containing largely German-language articles, with a few in English and French).

<doc id="78710" wikidata="Q933146" url="?curid=78710" title="Jack Lang (Australian politician)">
<text>John Thomas Lang (21 December 1876 – 27 September 1975), nicknamed &quot;The Big Fella&quot;, was an Australian politician. He served two terms as premier of New South Wales, in office from 1925 to 1927 and from 1930 to 1932. He was the state leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1923 to 1939 and his Lang Labor faction was an influential force in both state and federal politics, breaking away from the official ALP on several occasions.

Lang was born to a working-class family in Sydney and grew up in the city&#x27;s inner suburbs. He left school at the age of 14 and worked a variety of jobs, eventually establishing a real estate agency in the Sydney suburb of Auburn. Lang was first elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the 1913 state election and would hold several seats over the following 30 years. He remained loyal to the ALP following the 1916 party split over conscription and served as state treasurer from 1920 to 1922 in the governments of John Storey and James Dooley.

In 1923, Lang replaced Dooley as state leader of the ALP, a position he would maintain for 15 years despite a confrontational and pugnacious leadership style and competing factional demands. He led the party to a narrow victory at the 1925 state election. His first term as premier saw the passage of social and industrial reforms, but was also marked by conflict with the conservative Legislative Council and by internal party conflict. He was forced to an early election in 1927, which saw the ALP defeated. However, Lang and the ALP were returned to office in a landslide victory at the 1930 election.

During the Great Depression, Lang was a key figure in the ALP split of 1931, which saw the defeat of the federal Labor government led by James Scullin. He advocated economic populism and produced the &quot;Lang Plan&quot;, which called for the repudiation or deferral of overseas debts to avoid the austerity measures in the Premiers&#x27; Plan. Lang&#x27;s supporters in federal parliament supported a no-confidence motion in Scullin&#x27;s government, with the ALP suffering a landslide defeat at the 1931 federal election. Lang&#x27;s continued conflict with the new federal government led by Joseph Lyons, including defiance of federal laws, precipitated the 1932 New South Wales constitutional crisis. The crisis culminated with the dismissal of Lang by the governor Philip Game using his reserve powers, the only such dismissal of an Australian state premier.

After his dismissal, Lang suffered a landslide defeat at the 1932 state election and led the ALP to further defeats at the 1935 and 1938 state elections. His faction rejoined the official ALP in 1936, but factional conflict continued and he was finally ousted as leader in 1939. Attributing his defeat to communists, in 1940 he formed the Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist), which achieved some electoral success but soon rejoined the official ALP in the interests of wartime unity. Lang was expelled from the ALP in 1943 and later served a single term in the House of Representatives from 1946 to 1949, representing the seat of Reid. He assumed the role of elder statesman in retirement and was re-admitted to the ALP in 1971 a few years before his death at the age of 98.

==Early life==
John Thomas Lang was born on 21 December 1876 on George Street, Sydney, close to the present site of The Metro Theatre (between Bathurst and Liverpool Streets). He was the third son (and sixth of ten children) of James Henry Lang, a watchmaker born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and Mary Whelan, a milliner born in Galway, Ireland. His mother and father had arrived in Australia in 1848 and 1860, respectively, and married in Melbourne, Victoria, on 11 June 1866, moving to Sydney five years later. Although Lang&#x27;s father had been born Presbyterian, he later became a Catholic like his wife, and the family &quot;fitted into the normal low social stratum of the great majority of Sydney&#x27;s Catholics&quot;.

The family lived in the inner-city slums for the majority of Lang&#x27;s early childhood, including for a period on Wexford Street in Surry Hills, where he attended a local school, St Francis Marist Brothers&#x27; on Castlereagh Street. His father suffered from rheumatic fever for most of Lang&#x27;s childhood, and he supplemented his family&#x27;s income by selling newspapers in the city on mornings and afternoons. In the mid-1880s, due to his parents&#x27; poverty, he was sent to live with his mother&#x27;s sister on a small rural property near Bairnsdale, in the Gippsland region of Victoria, attending for about four years the local Catholic school. Lang returned to New South Wales in the early 1890s to seek employment, aged 14. His first jobs were in the rural areas to the south-west of Sydney: on a poultry farm at Smithfield, and then as the driver of a horse-drawn omnibus in and around Merrylands and Guildford.

Aged 16, he returned to the inner city, working first in a bookstore, and then as an office boy for an accountant. Nairn (1986) writes that Lang&#x27;s experience in the Sydney slums brought &quot;an intimate knowledge […] of the protean denizens who found shelter there&quot;, inculcating in Lang some &quot;real sympathy for them, but above all a determination to avoid their kind of existence, reinforced by a revulsion against the hardships of his own life in a large, generally poverty-stricken family.&quot;

==Early career==
During the banking crash of the 1890s which devastated Australia, Lang became interested in politics, frequenting radical bookshops and helping with newspapers and publications of the infant Labor Party, which contested its first election in New South Wales in 1891. At the age of 19 he married Hilda Amelia Bredt (1878–1964), the 17-year-old daughter of prominent feminist and socialist Bertha Bredt, and the step-daughter of W. H. McNamara, who owned a bookshop in Castlereagh Street. Hilda&#x27;s sister, also named Bertha, was married to the author and poet Henry Lawson.

Lang became a junior office assistant for an accounting practice, where his shrewdness and intelligence saw his career advance. Around 1900 he became the manager of a real estate firm in the then semi-rural suburb of Auburn. He was so successful that he soon set up his own real estate business in an area much in demand by working-class families looking to escape the squalor and overcrowding of the inner-city slums.

As a resident in the unincorporated area around Silverwater and Newington, Lang became Secretary of the Newington Progress Association and led local efforts for the area to join the Municipality of Auburn. On 20 June 1906, this was proclaimed, with the area included as the &quot;Newington Ward&quot;, returning three aldermen. Lang was elected to first position in the new ward in April 1907, and served two terms as Mayor of Auburn in 1909–1911.

He was elected as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1913 for the district of Granville, serving as a backbencher in the Labor Party government led by William Holman. When Prime Minister Billy Hughes twice tried to introduce conscription to the country in WWI, Lang sided with the anti-conscriptionist wing of the ALP. The mass defection from the ALP of parliamentarians and supporters who supported the military measure opened up opportunities and Lang positioned himself for advancement. His financial skills led him to become Treasurer in Premier John Storey&#x27;s Labor government from 1920 to 1922. Due to the post-World War I financial recession, the state&#x27;s accounts were in deficit; Lang managed to cut this deficit significantly. From 1920 to 1927, he was a member for the multi-member seat of Parramatta.

After the Labor Party (ALP) lost government in 1922, Lang was elected as Opposition Leader in 1923 by his fellow Labor Party MPs. He led the ALP to victory in the 1925 NSW general election and became Premier.

==Lang premiership==
===First term, 1925–1927===
During his first term as Premier, Lang carried out many social programmes, including state pensions for widowed mothers with dependent children under fourteen, a universal and mandatory system of workers&#x27; compensation for death, illness and injury incurred on the job, funded by premiums levied on employers, the abolition of student fees in state-run high schools and improvements to various welfare schemes such as child endowment (which Lang&#x27;s government had introduced). Various laws were introduced providing for improvements in the accommodation of rural workers, changes in the industrial arbitration system, and a 44-hour workweek. Extensions were made to the applicability of the Fair Rents Act while compulsory marketing along the lines of what existed in Queensland was introduced. Adult franchise for local government elections was also introduced, together with Legislation to safeguard native flora and to penalize ships for discharging oil. His government also carried out road improvements, including paving much of the Hume Highway and the Great Western Highway.

Lang also restored the seniority and conditions to New South Wales Government Railways and New South Wales Government Tramways workers who had been sacked or demoted after the General Strike of 1917, including Ben Chifley, a future Prime Minister of Australia.

Lang established universal suffrage in local government elections – previously only those who owned real estate in a city, municipality or shire could vote in that area&#x27;s local council elections. His government also passed legislation to allow women to sit in the upper house of the New South Wales Parliament in 1926. This was the first government to do so in the British Empire and three years before the &#x27;Persons Case&#x27; decision of the Privy Council in London would grant the same privilege to women throughout the Empire.

By contrast, his attempts to abolish the life-appointed upper house of the NSW Parliament, the Legislative Council, were unsuccessful. His attempts, based around requesting from the governor, Sir Dudley de Chair, enough appointees to swamp the council that would then vote for its abolition (the same approach his Queensland Labor colleagues had taken to their upper house in 1922), brought him into significant conflict with the governor. However, his government&#x27;s agenda required more political support to pass than the upper house was able to give, and Lang and the Labor party sought to eliminate what they saw as an outdated bastion of conservative privilege through this approach. At the occasion of the laying of the foundation stone for the new Auburn Town Hall in November 1926, he declared: &quot;If I have my way, the Upper House will not be there much longer. Such a condition cannot continue, and, in fact, will not prevail much longer; but, for the time being, it is there, and our laws must continue to suffer while it exists.&quot;

After Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 1927 election, Lang was Opposition Leader again from 1927 to October 1930. After New South Wales returned to single-member electorates, Lang was elected as the member for Auburn, a seat he held until he left state politics in 1946. In this period the Great Depression in Australia had begun in earnest with devastating effects on the nation&#x27;s welfare and security.

===Second term, 1930–1932===
In 1930, more than one in five adult males in New South Wales were without a job. Australian governments responded to the Depression with measures that, Lang claimed, made circumstances even worse - cuts to government spending, civil service salaries and public works cancellations. Lang vigorously opposed these measures and was elected in a landslide in October 1930.

As Premier, Lang refused to cut government salaries and spending, a stand which was popular with his constituents, but which made the state&#x27;s fiscal position more parlous, though the economic state of the six other various Australian governments fared little better during this same period. In the wake of the Great Depression, measures were taken to ease the hardships of evicted tenants together with the hardships facing householders and other debtors battling to meet repayments. He passed laws restricting the rights of landlords to evict defaulting tenants, and insisted on paying the legal minimum wage to all workers on relief projects.

At an economic crisis conference in Canberra in 1931, Jack Lang announced his own programme for economic recovery. The &quot;Lang Plan&quot; advocated the temporary cessation of interest repayments on debts to Britain and that interest on all government borrowings be reduced to 3% to free up money for injection into the economy, the abolition of the Gold standard to be replaced by a &quot;Goods Standard&quot; where the amount of money in circulation was linked to the number of goods produced, and the immediate injection of £18 million of new money into the economy in the form of Commonwealth Bank of Australia credit. The Prime Minister and all other state Premiers rejected the plan.

Lang was a powerful orator, and during the crisis of the Depression, he addressed huge crowds in Sydney and other centres, promoting his populist program and denouncing his opponents and the wealthy in extravagant terms. His followers promoted the slogans &quot;Lang is Right&quot; and &quot;Lang is Greater than Lenin.&quot; Lang was not a revolutionary or even a socialist, and he loathed the Communist Party, which in turn denounced him as a social fascist.

On 19 March 1932, Lang opened the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Lang caused some controversy when he insisted on officially opening the bridge himself, rather than allowing the Governor, the King&#x27;s representative in NSW, to do so. He delivered what has come to be regarded as a landmark speech in Australian political history during the Opening, citing the theme that the completion of the Sydney Harbour Bridge was analogous to the history, development and dreams of the Australian nation and its people. It may be inferred that this speech depicted Lang&#x27;s personal vision of the past, present and future of New South Wales and Australia&#x27;s place in the British Empire and world, (to read this speech, refer to &#x27;Stirring Australian Speeches&#x27;, edited by Michael Cathcart and Kate Darian-Smith). Just as Lang was about to cut the ribbon to open the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Captain Francis de Groot, a member of the paramilitary New Guard movement, rode up and broke the ribbon. The New Guard also planned to kidnap Lang, and plotted a coup against him during the crisis that brought Lang&#x27;s premiership to an end.

===The Crisis of 1931–1932===
Early in 1931, Jack Lang released his own plan to combat the Depression; this became known as &quot;the Lang Plan&quot;. This was in contrast to the &quot;Melbourne Agreement&quot;, later known as the Premiers&#x27; Plan, which all other State Governments and the Federal Government had agreed to in 1930. Key points of the Lang Plan included the temporary cessation of interest repayments on debts to Britain and that interest on all government borrowings be reduced to 3% to free up money for injection into the economy, the cancellation of interest payments to overseas bondholders and financiers on government borrowings, the injection of more funds into the nation&#x27;s money supply as central bank credit for the revitalisation of industry and commerce, and the abolition of the gold standard, to be replaced by a &quot;Goods Standard,&quot; whereby the amount of currency in circulation would be fixed to the number of goods produced within the Australian economy. The banks had indicated that if he paid the interest they would advance him an additional amount which was greater than the interest, thus giving him a positive cash flow.

Lang opposed the Premiers&#x27; Plan agreed to by the federal Labor government of James Scullin and the other state Premiers, who called for even more stringent cuts to government spending to balance the budget. In October 1931 Lang&#x27;s followers in the federal House of Representatives crossed the floor to vote with the conservative United Australia Party and bring down the Scullin government. This action split the NSW Labor Party in two – Lang&#x27;s followers became known as Lang Labor, while Scullin&#x27;s supporters, led by Chifley, became known in NSW as Federal Labor. Most of the party&#x27;s branches and affiliated trade unions supported Lang.

Since the Commonwealth Government had become responsible for state debts in 1928 under an amendment to the Constitution, the new UAP government of Joseph Lyons paid the interest to the overseas bondholders and then set about extracting the money from NSW by passing the &quot;Financial Agreement Enforcement Act 1932&quot;, which the High Court held to be valid. Lang then contended that the Act was rendered null and void by contravening the 1833 prohibition of slavery throughout the British Empire; the Premier held that the actions of the Lyons government deprived the State of New South Wales means of paying the wages of State employees and that this necessarily constituted an (illegal) state of slavery.

In response, Lang withdrew all the state&#x27;s funds from government bank accounts and held them at the Trades Hall in cash, so the federal government could not gain access to the money. The Governor, Sir Philip Game, a retired Royal Air Force officer, advised Lang that in his view this action was illegal and that if Lang did not reverse it he would dismiss the government. Lang stood firm, and on 13 May 1932, the Governor withdrew Lang&#x27;s commission and appointed the UAP leader, Bertram Stevens, as premier. Stevens immediately called an election, at which Labor was heavily defeated.
Gerald Stone, in his book &quot;1932&quot;, states that there is evidence that Lang considered arresting the Governor to prevent the Governor from dismissing him, (which Lang admitted in his own book, &quot;The Turbulent Years&quot;). The possibility was sufficiently high that the armed forces of the Commonwealth were put on alert. Andrew Moore and Michael Cathcart, among others, have put forward the possibility that such a clash would have seen the Commonwealth Armed Forces fighting the New South Wales Police.

This was the first case of an Australian government with the confidence of the lower house of Parliament being dismissed by a Vice-Regal representative, the second case being when Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Gough Whitlam&#x27;s government on 11 November 1975 (which Lang would not live to see by just 45 days). Game himself felt his decision was the right one, despite the fact that he had no personal animosity towards Lang. On 2 July 1932 Game wrote to his mother-in-law: &quot;Still with all his faults of omission and commission I had and still have a personal liking for Lang and a great deal of sympathy for his ideals and I did not at all relish being forced to dismiss him. But I felt faced with the alternative of doing so or reducing the job of Governor all over the Empire to a farce.&quot; Lang himself, despite objecting to his dismissal conceded afterwards that he too liked Game, regarding him as fair and polite, and having had good relations with him.

==Later career==

Lang continued to lead the Labor Opposition, although the NSW Branch of the ALP remained separate from the rest of the party. The UAP won the elections of 1935 and 1938. After this third defeat, the Federal Labor forces began to gain ground in NSW, as many union officials became convinced that Labor would never win again in the state while Lang remained leader. Lang was ousted as NSW Opposition Leader in 1939 and was replaced by William McKell, who became Premier in 1941.

Lang was expelled from NSW Labor by the state executive on 5 March 1943, and started his own parallel Labor Party, called the ALP (Non-Communist), but this time with only minority support in the NSW party and unions. Through the 1940s, he railed against the dangers of communism as a &#x27;Cold War warrior&#x27;. He remained a member of the Legislative Assembly until 1946, resigning to stand for the Division of Reid in the Australian House of Representatives. His state seat of Auburn was won by his son Chris at a by-election. Jack Lang&#x27;s victory in Reid was unexpected; he was elected on a minority of the votes thanks to preferences given to him by the Liberal Party. In federal parliament, he is often cited as being the most effective of the opposition to the government of his old rival, Prime Minister Ben Chifley, despite voting for the latter&#x27;s &quot;Bank Act&quot; in 1947. He contested the seat of Blaxland in the 1949 federal election, but was defeated and never held office again, despite a bid to be elected to the Senate in 1951.

Lang spent his long retirement editing his newspaper &quot;The Century&quot;, and wrote several books about his political life, including &quot;The Great Bust&quot;, &quot;I Remember&quot; and &quot;The Turbulent Years&quot;. He grew increasingly conservative as he grew older, supporting the White Australia Policy after the rest of the labour movement had abandoned it. In &quot;I Remember&quot; he wrote: &quot;White Australia must not be regarded as a mere political shibboleth. It was Australia&#x27;s Magna Carta. Without that policy, this country would have been lost long ere this. It would have been engulfed in an Asian tidal wave.&quot; To the end of his life, he proudly proclaimed that &quot;Lang was Right.&quot; Lang also spent time visiting Sydney schools recounting recollections of his time in office to his young audience. Lang gave a number of lectures at Sydney University circa 1972–1973, at which he discussed his time in office and other topics such as economic reform. His address given on 1 July 1969 to the students of Sefton High School is available on tape at the Mitchell Library. He was re-admitted to the Labor Party in 1971, initiated by Blaxland MP Paul Keating and supported by Macquarie MP Tony Luchetti. In the 1993 ABC TV documentary &quot;Labor in Power&quot;, Keating noted on Lang: &quot;Lang finished his political life with not an ounce of bitterness in him. I never heard him ever refer to anyone disparagingly, and he always had a kind word for Curtin, always.&quot;

Lang died in Auburn in September 1975, aged 98, and was commemorated with a packed house and overflowing crowds outside Sydney&#x27;s St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral at his Requiem Mass and memorial service. His funeral was attended by prominent Labor leaders including then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. He was buried at Rookwood Cemetery, Sydney.

<text>Ampelos (, &quot;Vine&quot;) or Ampelus (Latin) was a personification of the grapevine and lover of Dionysus in Greek and Bacchus in Roman mythology. He was a satyr that either turned into a constellation or the grape vine, due to Dionysus.

== Mythology ==

===Nonnus===
In Nonnus&#x27;s etiology, Ampelos is a beautiful satyr youth, who was loved by Dionysus, and whose death was foreseen by the god. There are two versions of his death and Dionysus&#x27;s reaction to it. According to Nonnus, Ampelos was gored to death by a wild bull after he mocked the goddess Selene, a scene described as follows:

:&quot;[Ampelos, love of Dionysos, rode upon the back of a wild bull:] He shouted boldly to the fullfaced Moon (Mene)—&#x27;Give me best, Selene, horned driver of cattle! Now I am both—I have horns and I ride a bull!&#x27;
:
:So he called out boasting to the round Moon. Selene looked with a jealous eye through the air, to see how Ampelos rode on the murderous marauding bull. She sent him a cattlechasing gadfly; and the bull, pricked continually all over by the sharp sting, galloped away like a horse through pathless tracts [it then threw and gored him to death]&quot;
Upset by his death, Dionysus transformed Ampelos&#x27;s body into the first grape vine and created wine from his blood.

===Ovid===

The second version involves grape vines in a different manner. According to Ovid: 
:&quot;the reckless youth fell picking gaudy grapes on a branch. Liber [Dionysos] lifted the lost boy to the stars,&quot; turning him into one of the stars of the constellation Vindemitor or Vindiatrix (better known as Boötes).

==Dryad==
Various ampelosealso &quot;Ampelos&quot; in the singularalso appear in Greek mythology a variety of hamadryad.

== In the European tradition ==
During the Middle Ages and Renaissance Ampelos was not known. In the New Age and later, his image is found only occasionally. The myth about him was &quot;rediscovered&quot; in Europe in 17th century, when the first translations of &quot;The Acts of Dionysus&quot; were published. Such artists as Jacob Matham and Jan Mil took part in their design. An image of Ampelos can also be found, for example, in the books &quot;Etruscan, Greek and Roman antiquities&quot; (1766) by Pierre François Hugh d&#x27;Hankarville (English), &quot;Stories of ancient and modern wines&quot; (1824) by Dr. Alexander Henderson. The image of Ampelos appears in the works of Martin Opitz (1622), Heinrich Heine (&quot;The Gods in Exile&quot; (1853)) and Matthew Arnold (&quot;The Lost Wanderer&quot; (1898)), Roberto Calasso (1988). Some researchers also point out that the myth of Dionysus and Ampelos was one of the sources of inspiration for the French homosexual writer André Gide.

<text>In Greek mythology, Inachus, Inachos or Inakhos (Ancient Greek: Ἴναχος) was the first king of Argos. He was one of the three thousand sons of Oceanus and Tethys. The Inachus River, a river in eastern Peloponnese, is named after him.

== Family ==
Various ancient authors describe Inachus as being one of the river gods born of Titans Oceanus and Tethys, and thus to the Greeks, was part of the pre-Olympian or &quot;Pelasgian&quot; mythic landscape. In Greek iconography, Walter Burkert notes, the rivers are represented in the form of a bull with a human head or face. Although these myths have been passed down since then, one of the most remarkable findings of modern archaeology was the monuments and remains showing that Argos had indeed been an ancient civilization alongside Egypt and Babylonia.

Inachus had many children, the chief of whom were his two sons, Phoroneus and Aegialeus or Phegeus, and his two daughters, Io and Philodice, wife of Leucippus. The mother of these children was variously described in the sources, either an Oceanid named Melia, called the mother of Phoroneus and Aegialeus (or Phegeus), or another Oceanid named Argia, called the mother of Phoroneus and Io. Io is sometimes confused as the daughter of Inachus and Melia but she is the daughter of Inachus alone. Io was born from Inachus&#x27; mouth. Aside from the Inachians of whom he was simply the back-formed eponym, his other children include Mycene, the eponym of Mycenae, the spring nymph Amymone, Messeis, Hyperia, Themisto (mother of Arcas by Zeus). Argus Panoptes was also called the son of Inachus as what Asclepiades also asserted.

== Mythology ==

=== Reign ===
The historian Pausanias describes him as the eldest king of Argos who named the river after himself and sacrificed to Hera. He also notes that some said he was not a mortal, but a river. Inachus was also said to be first priest at Argos, the country was frequently called the land of Inachus. Jerome and Eusebius (both citing Castor of Rhodes), and as even late as 1812, John Lemprière euhemeristically asserted that he was the first king of Argos reigning for 50 years (B.C. 1807). Inachus divided the territories between his sons, Phegeus and Phoroneus who succeeded him as the second king of Argos. Inachus contemporary was Leucippus, the eight king of Sicyon.

The ancients themselves made several attempts to explain the stories about Inachus: sometimes they looked upon him as a native of Argos, who after the deluge of Deucalion led the Argives from the mountains into the plains, and confined the waters within their proper channels. After rendering the province of Argolis inhabitable again, he then founded the city of Argos. Other times, the ancients regarded Inachus as an immigrant who had come across the sea as the leader of an Egyptian or Libyan colony, and had united the Pelasgians, whom he found scattered on the banks of the Inachus. They who make Inachus to have come into Greece from beyond the sea regard his name as a Greek form for the Oriental term Enak, denoting “great” or “powerful,” and this last as the base of the Greek ἄναξ, “a king.”

In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Inachus is represented on Turnus&#x27;s shield. Compare the Inachos or Brimos of the Eleusinian Mysteries.



=== Contest of Poseidon and Hera ===
Inachus and his river god brothers Cephissus and Asterion were mediators in a land dispute between Poseidon and Hera. When they judged that the land belonged to Hera, Poseidon took away their water out of anger. For this reason neither Inachus nor either of the other rivers provided any water except during rainy seasons. In Danaan founding myth, because of the springs of Argolid being dried up, King Danaus sent his daughters to draw water to counter this drought. One of these daughters, Amymone, in her search lay with Poseidon who revealed to her the springs at Lerna. Otherwise, Poseidon was also said to flooded the greater part of the country as his revenge but Hera induced Poseidon to send the sea back. The Argives then made a sanctuary to Poseidon Prosclystius (Flooder) at the spot where the tide ebbed.

=== Tales about Io ===

==== Aeschylus ====
In an episode in &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, a horned Io recalls her history to Prometheus of being disturbed by visions during her sleep night after night, where Zeus lusted for her maidenhood, but of initially rejecting the god&#x27;s advances. When Io gained the courage to tell Inachus about these haunting dreams, his father sent many messengers to consult the oracle of Pytho and Dodona so that he might discover what deed or word of his would find favor with the gods. But the messengers returned with report of oracles, riddling, obscure, and darkly-worded. Then at last there came an unmistakable utterance to Inachus, charging and commanding him clearly that he must thrust forth Io from his house and native land to roam at large to the remotest confines of the earth, because if Inachus would not follow the oracle&#x27;s instructions, Zeus would hurl a fiery thunderbolt that would utterly destroy his whole race. The king yielding in obedience to such prophetic utterances of Loxias (Apollo), Inachus drove his daughter away and barred her from his house, against his and Io&#x27;s will.

==== Ovid ====
According to Ovid, Inachus was the only one absent when his fellow river gods, Sperchios, Enipeus, Amphrysos, Apidanus and Aeas, visited Peneus, father of Daphne, following the pursuit of his daughter by the god Apollo and her transformation into a laurel tree (they are not sure whether to congratulate or to condole Peneus). It was explained that Inachus hid in his cave, deepening his waters with his tears, bewailing also for his daughter Io who was lost. Inachus and his naiad daughters did not recognize Io, whom Zeus had transformed into a cow so that she could avoid detection by his jealous wife, Hera.
And Inachus and all her [i.e. Io] sister Naiads knew her not, although she followed them, they knew her not, although she suffered them to touch her sides and praise her. When the ancient Inachus gathered sweet herbs and offered them to her, she licked his hands, kissing her father&#x27;s palms, nor could she more restrain her falling tears. If only words as well as tears would flow, she might implore his aid and tell her name and all her sad misfortune; but, instead, she traced in dust the letters of her name with cloven hoof; and thus her sad estate was known. At this, Inachus understood Io&#x27;s condition, and, lamenting, wished for death, but acknowledged his godly status made this an impossibility. Io subsequently recovered her original form and came to be worshipped as a goddess.

==== Diodorus Siculus ====
In the account of Diodorus Siculus, after Io&#x27;s disappearance, Inachus sent forth Cyrnus, one of his men in high command, fitting him out with a considerable fleet, and ordered him to hunt for Io in every region and not to return unless he had got possession of her. And Cyrnus, after having wandered over many parts of the inhabited world without being able to find her, put ashore in Caria on the Cherronesus where he founded a city which bore his name Cyrnus.

==== Parthenius ====
In a rare variant of the myth according to Parthenius, Inachus sent several men to search and attempt to find her daughter Io who had been captured by brigands (not Zeus this time). One of these was Lyrcus, the son of Phoroneus, who covered a vast deal of land and sea without finding the girl, and finally renounced the toilsome quest. But he was too much afraid of Inachus to return to Argos and went instead to Caunus, where he married Hilebia, daughter of King Aegialus.

==== Plutarch ====
According to Plutarch, the river Inachus had before borne the name of Carmanor or Haliacmon. Afterwards it was called after Inachus, the son of Oceanus. After Zeus (Jupiter) had deflowered his daughter Io, Inachus pursued the deity close at the heels, abusing and cursing him all the way as he went. Which so offended Zeus, that he sent Tisiphone, one of the Furies, who haunted and plagued him to that degree, that he flung himself into the river Haliacmon, bearing his own name afterwards.

==== &quot;Suda&quot; ====

Inachos, a king of Argos, founded a city which he named for the moon, Io, for that is what Argives call the moon. He also had a daughter Io; Pekos who is also Zeus abducted her and fathered a daughter, Libya, by her. And Io, lamenting her ruin, fled to the Silpion Mountain and there died. Her father and her brothers, when they learned this, built a shrine to her and called the place Iopolis and remained there until the end. And they performed a ritual in her memory, banging on each other&#x27;s doors every year and saying &#x27;io, io!&#x27;.

==== Sophocles ====
Sophocles wrote an &quot;Inachos&quot;, probably a satyr play, which survives only in some papyrus fragments found at Oxyrhyncus and Tebtunis, Egypt; in it Inachos is reduced from magnificence to misery through the unrequited love of Zeus for his daughter Io. Hermes wears the cap of darkness, rendering him invisible, but plays the &quot;aulos&quot;, to the mystification of the satyrs; Argos and Iris, as a messenger of Hera both appear, a &quot;stranger&quot; turns Io into a heifer at the touch of a hand, and at the end, apparently, the satyrs are freed from their bondage, to become shepherds of Inachos. An additional papyrus fragment of Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Inachos&quot; was published in 1960.

== Mythology ==
Amycus was a doughty man but being a king he compelled strangers to box as a way of killing them. When the Argonauts passed through Bithynia, Amycus challenged the best man of the crew to a boxing match. Polydeuces undertook to box against him and killed him with a blow on the elbow.

When the Bebryces rush to avenge him, the chiefs snatched up their arms and put them to flight with great slaughter.

== Bay/Port ==

During ancient times, the bay at modern Beykoz was called Amykos.

<text>In Greek mythology, Phoroneus (; Ancient Greek: Φορωνεύς means &#x27;bringer of a price&#x27;) was a culture-hero of the Argolid, fire-bringer, law giver, and primordial king of Argos.

== Family ==
Phoroneus was the son of the river god Inachus and either Melia, the Oceanid or Argia, the embodiment of the Argolid itself: &quot;Inachus, son of Oceanus, begat Phoroneus by his sister Argia&quot;.

He was said to have been married to Cinna; or Cerdo, a nymph; or Teledice, also a nymph; or Perimede; or Peitho, and to have fathered a number of children including Apis, Car, Chthonia, Clymenus, Sparton, Lyrcus and Europs, an illegitimate son. An unnamed daughter of his is said to have consorted with Hecaterus and thus became the mother of the five Hecaterides, nymphs of the rustic dance.

In Argive culture, Niobe is associated with Phoroneus, sometimes as his mother, sometimes as his daughter, or as his consort (Kerenyi). According to Hellanicus of Lesbos, Phoroneus had at least three sons: Agenor, Jasus and Pelasgus. After the death of Phoroneus, the two elder brothers divided his dominions, Pelasgus received the country about the river Erasmus, and built Larissa, and Iasus the country about Elis. After the death of these two, Agenor, the youngest, invaded their dominions, and thus became king of Argos.

The &quot;Clementine Recognitions&quot; mentions Phthia, a daughter of Phoroneus, who became the mother of Achaeus by Zeus.
== Reign ==
Hyginus&#x27; genealogy expresses the position of Phoroneus as one of the primordial men, whose local identities differed in the various regions of Greece, and who had for a mother the essential spirit of the very earth of Argos herself, &quot;Argia&quot;. He was the primordial king in the Peloponnesus, authorized by Zeus: &quot;Formerly Zeus himself had ruled over men, but Hermes created a confusion of human speech, which spoiled Zeus&#x27; pleasure in this Rule&quot;. Phoroneus introduced both the worship of Hera and the use of fire and the forge. Poseidon and Hera had vied for the Argive when the primeval waters had receded, Phoroneus &quot;was the first to gather the people together into a community; for they had up to then been living as scattered and lonesome families&quot;. (Pausanias).

Phoroneus&#x27; successor was Argus, who was Niobe&#x27;s son, either by Zeus or Phoroneus himself. He was also the father of Apis, who may have also ruled Argos (according to Tatiānus). He was worshipped in Argos with an eternal fire that was shown to Pausanias in the 2nd century CE, and funeral sacrifices were offered to him at his tomb-sanctuary. He is also credited as the founder of law.

<doc id="78727" wikidata="Q482096" url="?curid=78727" title="Amymone">
<text>In Greek mythology, Amymone (; , &quot;blameless; innocent&quot;) was a daughter of Danaus, king of Libya and Europe, a queen. As the &quot;blameless&quot; Danaid, her name identifies her as, perhaps, identical to Hypermnestra (&quot;great wooing&quot; or &quot;high marriage&quot;), the one Danaid who did not assassinate her Egyptian husband on their wedding night, as her 49 sisters did. (See the myth at the entry for Danaus.) The author of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, however, mentions both Hypermnestra and Amymone in his list of names for the Danaids.

== Mythology ==

Poseidon had dried up all the region&#x27; of Argos&#x27; springs after the Argolid was awarded to the protection of Hera. It would appear from the myth that Poseidon preceded Hera in the heartland of her cult. But he rescued Amymone from a chthonic satyr that was about to rape her. To possess her himself, the god revealed the springs of Lerna, a cult site of great antiquity near the shores of the Argolid. 

Alternatively, in Fabulae, Hyginus writes that he threw his trident at the satyr, lodging it in a rock and making the satyr flee. Poseidon questioned why she was there, and after hearing the reason--to fetch water--he had Amymone remove his trident from the rock, where a spring now gushed from the rock.
To Poseidon she bore Nauplius, &quot;the navigator&quot;, who gave his name to the port city of Nafplio in the Argolid. 

Amymone, the blameless, was eventually reconciled with her father, and given in marriage to Lynceus, with whom she founded a race of kings that led to Danaë, the mother of Perseus, founder of Mycenae. Thus this founding myth of Argos also asserts that Argos was the metropolis (&quot;mother city&quot;) of Mycenae.

Amymone/Hypermnestra is represented with a water pitcher, a reminder of the sacred springs and lake of Lerna and of the copious wells that made Argos the &quot;well-watered&quot; and, by contrast, a reminder that her sisters were forever punished in Tartarus for their murderous crimes by fruitlessly drawing water in pitchers with open bases.

Aeschylus wrote a now lost satyr play called &quot;Amymone&quot; about the seduction of Amymone by Poseidon, which followed the trilogy that included &quot;The Suppliants&quot;.

<doc id="78731" wikidata="Q4057954" url="?curid=78731" title="Adrasteia">
<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Adrasteia (; , ), also spelled Adrastia, Adrastea, Adrestia, Adrestea, Adastreia or [[Adraste|Adrasta]], originally a Phrygian mountain goddess, probably associated with Cybele, was later a Cretan nymph, and daughter of Melisseus, who was charged by Rhea with nurturing the infant Zeus in secret, to protect him from his father Cronus. By at latest the fifth century BC, she became identified with Nemesis, the goddess of divine retribution.

==Cult==
Adrasteia was the goddess of &quot;inevitable fate&quot;, representing &quot;pressing necessity&quot;, and the inescapability of punishment. She had a cult at Cyzicus (with nearby temple), and on the Phrygian Mount Ida. Adrasteia was also the object of public worship in Athens from at least as early as 429 BC. Her name appears in the &quot;Accounts of the Treasurers of the Other Gods&quot;, associated with the Thracian goddess Bendis, with whom she seems to have shared a treasury or accounts, indicating that in Athens her cult was supported by public funds.

Adrasteia was also worshipped, together with Nemesis, at Kos. The 2nd-century geographer Pausanias, reports seeing a statue of Adrasteia in a temple of Apollo, Artemis, and Leto at Cirrha, near Delphi.

==Mythology==
Adrasteia came to be associated with the birth of Zeus. In this context she was said to be a nymph of Cretan Mount Ida. The Titaness Rhea gave her son, the infant Zeus, to the Curetes and the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus, to nurse, and they fed Zeus on the milk of the goat Amalthea. Adrasteia gave Zeus a wondrous toy ball to play with, later used by Aphrodite to bribe her son Eros.

In the Euripidean &quot;Rhesus&quot;, Adrasteia is said to be the daughter of Zeus.

==Associations with other goddesses==
===Cybele===
Adrasteia seems to have originally been a Phrygian mountain goddess, probably associated with Cybele, the mountain mother goddess of Anatolia. Priapus, Cyzicus, and the Troad, where Adrasteia&#x27;s cult was established, were also areas where Cybele was especially worshipped. The two earliest mentions of Adrasteia both suggest an association with Cybele. Adrasteia&#x27;s description, in a fragment from the lost epic poem &quot;Phoronis&quot; as a Phrygian mountain goddess served by the Idaean Dactyls, is hardly distinguishable from Cybele herself, while Aeschylus locates Adrasteia in the &quot;Berecynthan land&quot;, also the home of the &quot;Mother of the Gods&quot; (i.e. Cybele).

===Nemesis===
Although apparently of independent origin, Adrasteia also came to be associated with Nemesis, the goddess of divine retribution. Nemesis and Adrasteia were worshipped together at Kos. In the fifth century BC the two goddesses were often identified, with Adrasteia becoming merely an epithet of Nemesis. The explicit identification of the two goddesses is first found in the writings of the late fifth-century BC poet and grammarian Antimachus of Colophon.

===Artemis===
Adrasteia, like Nemesis, was also associated with Artemis. The land of the Berecyntians, where a fragment of Aeschylus&#x27; lost play &quot;Niobe&quot; locates the cult of Adrasteia, was also the home of Ephesian Artemis. According to the second-century-BC Greek grammarian Demetrius of Scepsis, a certain Adrastus established Adrasteia as another name for Artemis. As noted above Pausanias saw a statue of Adrasteia in a temple of Artemis near Delphi.

===Others===
Adrasteia was also sometimes associated with other goddesses, including the Titan Rhea (who was herself associated with Mother goddess Cybele), Ananke (Necessity), the personification of inevitability, and the Egyptian mother goddess Isis.

==Name==
The name Adrasteia can be understood as meaning &quot;Inescapable&quot;. Several ancient writers, regarding &#x27;Adrasteia&#x27; as an epithet for the goddess Nemesis, derived the epithet from the name &#x27;Adrastus&#x27;. Adrasteia was the name of a city and a plain in the Troad, a name known to Homer; and according to Strabo, the city and plain were said to have been named after a certain &quot;King Adrastus&quot;, of Hellespontine Phrygia, who was said to have built the first temple of Nemesis. Strabo tells us that according to Antimachus, Adrastus &quot;was the first to build an altar to [Nemesis] beside the stream of the Aesepus River&quot;, and that according to the fourth-century BC historian Callisthenes (&quot;FGrHist&quot; 124 F 28), &quot;Adrasteia was named after King Adrastus, who was the first to found a temple of Nemesis&quot;. Other ancient writers derived the epithet from the Greek &quot;&quot; (&quot;run away&quot;), interpreting the epithet to mean the goddess &quot;whom none can escape&quot;, connecting the epithet with the fate of the mythical Argive King Adrastus, leader of the doomed Seven against Thebes.

The name Adrasteia (perhaps in connection with the Argive Adrastus) also has geographical associations with Argolis. Pausanias mentions a spring called Adrasteia at Nemea, and Pseudo-Plutarch, mentions a root called Adraseia produced on a mountaintop in Argolis.

==Sources==
===Early===
The earliest surviving references to Adrasteia appear in a fragment from the epic poem the &quot;Phoronis&quot; (c. sixth century BC), and in a fragment from the lost play &quot;Niobe&quot; (c. early 5th century BC), by the tragedian Aeschylus. In both she is a Phrygian mountain goddess associated with Mount Ida.

The &quot;Phoronis&quot; describes Adrasteia as a mountain goddess, whose servants were the Idaean Dactyls, Phrygian &quot;wizards (&quot;γόητες&quot;) of Ida&quot;, who were the first to discover iron and iron working:
:... where the wizards of Ida, Phrygian men, had their mountain homes: Kelmis, great Damnameneus, and haughty Akmon, skilled servants of Adrastea of the mountain, they who first, by the arts of crafty Hephaestus, discovered dark iron in the mountain glens, and brought it to the fire, and promulgated a fine achievement.

Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Niobe&quot; fragment mentions the &quot;territory of Adrasteia&quot; associating it with the Berecyntians, a Phrygian tribe, and Mount Ida:
:The land I [Tanatalus] sow extends for twelve days’ journey: the country of the Berecyntians, where the territory of Adrasteia and Mount Ida resound with the lowing and bleating of livestock, and all of the Erechthean plain.

Once in the Aeschylean &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, and twice in the Euripidean &quot;Rhesus&quot;, Adrasteia is invoked as a ward against the consequences of boastful speech (perhaps here being identified with Nemesis as the punisher of boasts). In &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, after Prometheus foretells the fall of Zeus, the chorus warns Prometheus that the wise &quot;bow to Adrasteia&quot;, a formulaic expression meaning to apologize for a remark which might offend some divinity. In the &quot;Rhesus&quot;, the chorus, because of the praise they are about to give Rhesus, invoke the goddess saying:
:May Adrasteia, daughter of Zeus
:shield my words from divine hostility!
In a subsequent passage the hero Rhesus invokes her (&quot;may Adrasteia not resent my words&quot;) before boasting to the Trojan hero Hector that he will defeat the Greeks at Troy and sack all of Greece.

Adrasteia was explicitly identified with Nemesis by Antimachus of Colophon (late fifth century BC). The geographer Strabo quotes Antimachus as saying:
:There is a great goddess Nemesis, who has obtained as her portion all these things from the Blessed. Adrestus was the first to build an altar to her beside the stream of the Aesepus River, where she is worshipped under the name of Adresteia.

In a similar vein to the Aeschylean and Euripidean invocations, Plato, in his &quot;Republic&quot; (c. 375 BC), has Socrates invoke Arasteia (i.e. Nemesis?) as a ward against divine retribution for—not a boast—but rather an eccentric idea:
:I bow myself down before Adrasteia, Glaucon, because of what I am about to say. You see, I really do suppose it a lesser misdemeanor to become the involuntary murderer of someone than to lead people astray about principles of what is fine and good and just.
Plato (followed by the early Stoics) also equates Adrasteia with Fate, as the judge of reincarnating souls:
:And this is a law of [Adrasteia], that the soul which follows after God and obtains a view of any of the truths is free from harm until the next period, and if it can always attain this, is always unharmed;

===Late===
Both the early 3rd-century BC poet Callimachus, and the mid 3rd-century BC poet Apollonius of Rhodes, name Adrasteia as a nurse of the infant Zeus. According to Callimachus, Adrasteia, along with the ash-tree nymphs, the Meliae, laid Zeus &quot;to rest in a cradle of gold&quot;, and fed him with honeycomb, and the milk of the goat Amaltheia. Apollonius of Rhodes, describes a wondrous toy ball which Adrasteia gave the child Zeus, when she was his nurse in the &quot;Idean cave&quot;.

According to Apollodorus, Adrasteia and Ida were daughters of Melisseus, who nursed Zeus, feeding him on the milk of Amalthea. Hyginus says that Adrasteia, along with her sisters Ida and Amalthea, were daughters of Oceanus, or that according to &quot;others&quot; they were Zeus&#x27;s nurses, &quot;the ones that are called Dodonian Nymphys (others call them the Naiads)&quot;.

===Orphic===
The story of Adrasteia as one of the nurses of Zeus possibly originated as early as a late-fifth-century Orphic theogony (the Eudemian Theogony). Several possible Orphic sources contain accounts of Zeus being nursed by Adrasteia and Ida (here the daughters of Mellissos and Amalthea) and guarded by the Curetes. These have Adrasteia clashing bronze cymbals in front of the cave of Night (Nyx) where the infant Zeus was being concealed, from his father Cronus, so that the infant&#x27;s cries would not be heard. In one she is said to be a &quot;lawgiver&quot; (&quot;νομοθετοῦσα&quot;) outside the cave&#x27;s entrance.

Another later Orphic theogony (the Hieronyman Theogony, c. 200 BC?) has Adrasteia (or Necessity) united with ageless Time (Chronos) at the beginning of the cosmos.

<text>In Greek mythology, Anaxarete (Ancient Greek: Ἀναξαρέτη means &#x27;excellent princess&#x27;) was a maiden of Cyprus, &quot;a proud princess in the line of Teucer&#x27;s descendants&quot;, who refused the advances of a shepherd named Iphis.

== Mythology ==
Iphis&#x27; advances were described in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; in the following paragraph:

:&quot;“Now he would confess his sorry love to her nurse, asking her not to be hard on him, by the hopes she had for her darling. At other times he flattered each of her many attendants, with enticing words, seeking their favourable disposition. Often he gave them messages to carry to her, in the form of fawning letters. Sometimes he hung garlands on her doorpost wet with his tears, and lay with his soft flank on the hard threshold, complaining at the pitiless bolts barring the way.”&quot;

Anaxarete spurned him and mocked his feelings until he cried in despair and hanged himself on her doorstep. Anaxarete was still unmoved. When she mocked his funeral, calling it pitiful, Aphrodite turned her into a stone statue. According to Ovid, the statue was preserved at Salamis in Cyprus, in the temple of Venus Prospiciens.

A similar tale is told by Antoninus Liberalis, although he names the maiden Arsinoë, and her admirer Arceophon.

<text>Iphis ( , ; ) was a name attributed to the following individuals in Greek mythology.

The feminine name Iphis (Ἶφις &quot;Îphis&quot;, gen. Ἴφιδος &quot;Ī́phidos&quot;) refers to the following personages.
*Iphis, daughter of Ligdus and Telethusa. Iphis was raised male and eventually transformed into a man by the goddess Isis in order to marry Ianthe, daughter of Telestes.
* Iphis, as recounted in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, was the slave of Patroclus, Achilles&#x27; companion-in-arms. A native of Scyros, she had been enslaved by Achilles when the latter conquered her home island, and given by him to Patroclus. Pausanias describes a painting of Iphis, Diomede and Briseis admiring Helen&#x27;s beauty as the latter has been brought back to the Greek camp from the sacked Troy.
* Iphis, a Thespian princess as one of the 50 daughters of King Thespius and Megamede or by one of his many wives. When Heracles hunted and ultimately slayed the Cithaeronian lion, Iphis with her other sisters, except for one, all laid with the hero in a night, a week or for 50 days as what their father strongly desired it to be. Iphis bore Heracles a son, Celeustanor.
* Iphis, daughter of Peneus, mother of Salmoneus by Aeolus, the son of Hellen.
* Iphis, variant for Iphigenia or Iphianassa.

The masculine name Iphis (Ἶφις &quot;Îphis&quot;, gen. Ἴφιος &quot;Ī́phios&quot;) refers to the following personages.
* Iphis, in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses,&quot; was a Cypriot shepherd who loved a woman named Anaxarete. Anaxarete scorned him and Iphis killed himself in despair. Because Anaxarete was still unmoved, Aphrodite changed her to stone. In a different variant they are called Arceophon and Arsinoë.
* Iphis, son of Alector, was one of the kings in Argos. Polynices came to him for advice on how to get Amphiaraus to join the Seven against Thebes. He advised him to give Eriphyle the necklace of Harmonia. He was the father of Eteoclus, Evadne (wife of Capaneus) and Laodice (mother of Capaneus). He left his kingdom to his grandson Sthenelus, the son of his son-in-law Capaneus.
* Iphis or Iphitus, one of the Argonauts, son of Sthenelus and brother of Eurystheus, from Argos. He was killed in battle in Colchis by Aeetes.
* Iphis, one of the defenders of Thebes in the war of the Seven against Thebes. He was killed by Acamas.
* Iphis, father of Ligdus (see above).

<text>Johannes Wilhelm &quot;Hans&quot; Geiger (; ; 30 September 1882 – 24 September 1945) was a German physicist. He is best known as the co-inventor of the detector component of the Geiger counter and for the Geiger–Marsden experiment which discovered the atomic nucleus. He also performed the Bothe–Geiger coincidence experiment that confirmed the conservation of energy in light-particle interactions.

He was the brother of meteorologist and climatologist Rudolf Geiger.

==Biography==
Geiger was born at Neustadt an der Haardt, Germany. He was one of five children born to the Indologist Wilhelm Ludwig Geiger, who was a professor at the University of Erlangen. In 1902, Geiger started studying physics and mathematics at the University of Erlangen and was awarded a doctorate in 1906. His thesis was on electrical discharges through gases. He received a fellowship to the University of Manchester and worked as an assistant to Arthur Schuster. In 1907, after Schuster&#x27;s retirement, Geiger began to work with his successor, Ernest Rutherford, and in 1908, along with Ernest Marsden, conducted the famous Geiger–Marsden experiment (also known as the &quot;gold foil experiment&quot;). This process allowed them to count alpha particles and led Rutherford to start thinking about the structure of the atom.

In 1911 Geiger and John Mitchell Nuttall discovered the Geiger–Nuttall law (or rule) and performed experiments that led to Rutherford&#x27;s atomic model.

In 1912, Geiger was named head of radiation research at the &quot;Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt&quot; (Imperial Physical Technical Institute – PTR) in Charlottenburg. There he worked with Walter Bothe (winner of the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics) and James Chadwick (winner of the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics). Work was interrupted when Geiger served in the German military during World War I as an artillery officer from 1914 to 1918.

In 1924, Geiger and Bothe carried the Bothe–Geiger coincidence experiment that confirmed the Compton effect which helped earn Arthur Compton the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics. Bothe would also receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for their experiment in 1954, after Geiger&#x27;s death.

In 1925, he began a teaching position at the University of Kiel where, in 1928 Geiger and his student Walther Müller created an improved version of the Geiger tube, the Geiger–Müller tube. This new device not only detected alpha particles, but beta and gamma particles as well, and is the basis for the Geiger counter.

In 1929 Geiger was named professor of physics and director of research at the University of Tübingen where he made his first observations of a cosmic ray shower. In 1936 he took a position with Technische Universität Berlin where he continued to research cosmic rays, nuclear fission, and artificial radiation until his death in 1945.

Beginning in 1939, after the discovery of atomic fission, Geiger was a member of the Uranium Club, the German investigation of nuclear weapons during World War II. The group splintered in 1942 after its members came to believe (incorrectly, as it would later transpire) that nuclear weapons would not play a significant role in ending the war.

Although Geiger signed a petition against the Nazi government&#x27;s interference with universities, he provided no support to colleague Hans Bethe (winner of the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physics) when he was fired for being Jewish.

Geiger endured the Battle of Berlin and subsequent Soviet occupation in April/May 1945. A couple of months later he moved to Potsdam, dying there on 24 September 1945.

<text>In Greek mythology, Rhoeo (; ) was a lover of Apollo and mother of Anius, king of Delos and priest of Apollo.

== Family ==
Rhoeo was the daughter of Staphylus, son of Dionysus and Ariadne, and Chrysothemis, daughter of Carmanor. Her sisters were Parthenos and Molpadia (later named Hemithea).

In one account, Rhoeo was named as one of the possible mothers of the hero Jason by Aeson.

== Mythology ==
Parthenius relates that she once experienced a great jealousy of her sister Hemithea when Staphylus arranged for the latter to spend a night with Lyrcus, his guest, whom both Hemithea and Rhoeo fell in love with.

She became the lover of Apollo and by him the mother of Anius. When her father discovered her pregnancy, he believed she was impregnated by a man rather than a god. He placed her in a chest and cast her out to sea (parallel to Danae and Perseus). She landed on the island of Delos, which was sacred to Apollo. She gave birth to a son on the island and named him Anius (as if from &quot;to suffer&quot;); she then put him on the altar of Apollo and prayed to the god that the baby be saved if it was his. Apollo concealed the child for a while, then raised him and taught him the art of divination and granted him certain honors.

Rhoeo eventually married Zarex, son of Carystus or Carycus, who accepted Anius as his son. She had two more children with him. Later, becoming a priest of Apollo and the king of Delos, Anius gave aid to Aeneas and his retinue when they were travelling from Troy to the future site of Rome.

<text>In Greek mythology, Anius (Ancient Greek: Ἄνιος) was a king of Delos and priest of Apollo.

== Family ==
He was the son of Apollo and Rhoeo, daughter of Staphylus and Chrysothemis.

== Mythology ==
Anius was born either on the island of Delos, which was sacred to his father Apollo, or on Euboea, after the box in which his mother had been placed by Staphylus when he had discovered her pregnancy was washed ashore there. Rhoeo then, placing the baby on Apollo&#x27;s altar, asked the god to care for it, if it was his. Rhoeo then married Zarex, who thus became the legal father of Anius. Apollo cared for the child Anius for a long time, teaching him the arts of divination and prophecy. Anius later became Apollo&#x27;s priest and the king of Delos.

Anius had three daughters: Oeno, Spermo, and Elais, known as the Oenotropae; and three sons, Andros, Mykonos, and Thasos. Their mother was Dorippe, a Thracian woman ransomed by Anius for the price of a horse from the pirates who had kidnapped her. Dionysus gave the three daughters the power to change whatever they wanted into wine, wheat, and oil. When the Greeks landed on Delos while on their way to Troy, Anius prophesied that the Trojan War would not be won until the tenth year, and insisted that they stay with him for nine years, promising that his daughters would supply them with aliments during that period. When Agamemnon heard this, he wanted to take the Oenotropae with him by force, to provide his army with food and wine. They prayed to Dionysus, who changed them into doves.

Of Anius&#x27;s three sons, Andros and Mykonos became eponyms of the islands of Andros and Mykonos respectively. As for Thasos, he was devoured by dogs, and since then it was prohibited to keep dogs on Delos.

Later, Anius, an old friend of Anchises, gave aid to him, his son Aeneas, and his retinue when they were fleeing from Troy and en route to the future site of Rome. According to a rare version of the myth, Aeneas married Anius&#x27;s daughter Lavinia (or Launa), who, like her father, had prophetic abilities and bore Aeneas a son, who was also named Anius.

<doc id="78745" wikidata="Q272006" url="?curid=78745" title="Antaeus">
<text>Antaeus (; , derived from ), known to the Berbers as Anti, was a figure in Berber and Greek mythology. He was famed for his defeat by Heracles as part of the Labours of Hercules.

== Family ==
In Greek sources, he was the son of Poseidon and Gaia, who lived in the interior desert of Libya. His wife was the goddess Tinge, for whom it was claimed that the city of Tangier in Morocco was named (though it could be the other way around), and he had a daughter named Alceis or Barce. Another daughter, Iphinoe, consorted with Heracles.

==Mythology==

Antaeus would challenge all passers-by to wrestling matches and remained invincible as long as he remained in contact with his mother, the earth. As Greek wrestling, like its modern equivalent, typically attempted to force opponents to the ground, he always won, killing his opponents. He built a temple to his father using their skulls. Antaeus fought Heracles as he was on his way to the Garden of Hesperides as his 11th Labour. Heracles realized that he could not beat Antaeus by throwing or pinning him. Instead, he held him aloft and then crushed him to death in a bear hug.

The contest between Heracles and Antaeus was a favored subject in ancient and Renaissance sculpture.

===Location in Africa===
Antaeus is placed in the interior desert of Libya. He was probably incorporated into Greek mythology after the Greek colonization of Cyrenaica in the mid-seventh century BC.

A location for Antaeus somewhere far within the Berber world might be quite flexible in longitude: when the Roman commander Quintus Sertorius crossed from Hispania to North Africa, he was told by the residents of Tingis (Tangier), far to the west of Libya, that the gigantic remains of Antaeus would be found within a certain tumulus; digging it open, his men found giant bones; closing the site, Sertorius made propitiatory offerings and &quot;helped to magnify the tomb&#x27;s reputation&quot;. It is proposed that this monument is the Msoura stone circle, 50 km from Tangier. In Book IV of Marcus Annaeus Lucanus&#x27; epic poem &quot;Pharsalia&quot; (c. AD 65-61), the story of Heracles&#x27; victory over Antaeus is told to the Roman Curio by an unnamed Libyan citizen. The learned client king Juba II (died 23 BC), husband of the daughter of Antony and Cleopatra, claimed his descent from a liaison of Heracles with Tinga, the consort of Antaeus. In his &quot;Life of Sertorius&quot; cited above, Plutarch recounts what he says to be a local myth, according to which Heracles consorted with Tinge after the death of Antaeus and had by her a son Sophax, who named the city Tingis after his mother. Sophax in his turn was father of Diodorus who conquered many Libyan peoples with his army of Olbians and Mycenaeans brought to Libya by Heracles. Moreover, some related that Heracles had a son Palaemon by Iphinoe, the daughter of Antaeus and (presumably) Tinge.

Scholiasts on Pindar&#x27;s Pythian Ode 9 also recorded a story which made Antaeus king of the city Irassa in Libya, and father of a daughter named either Alceis or Barce. Antaeus promised her hand to the winner of a race, just as Danaus had done to find husbands for his daughters. Alexidamus beat all the other suitors in the race and married the daughter of Antaeus. Three versions of this story, with minor variations, were collected by the scholiasts; one of those versions made Antaeus, king of Irassa, a figure distinct from the Antaeus killed by Heracles, while another one suggested that they were one and the same.

The ancient city of Barca, probably located at Marj, Libya, was also called Antapolis after Antaeus. &quot;Antaeopolis&quot; is also the Graeco-Roman name of Tjebu, an Egyptian city. They identified the tutelary god of Tjebu, Nemty, a fusion of Seth and Horus, with Antaeus, although he may be different from the Libyan Antaeus.

<text>Yusuf Islam (born Steven Demetre Georgiou; ), commonly known by his stage names Cat Stevens, Yusuf, and Yusuf / Cat Stevens, is a British singer-songwriter and musician. He has sold more than 100 million records and has more than two billion streams. His musical style consists of folk, rock, pop, and, later in his career, Islamic music. Following two decades in which he performed only music which met strict religious standards, he returned to making secular music in 2006. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014. He has received two honorary doctorates and awards for promoting peace as well as other humanitarian awards.

His 1967 debut album and its title song &quot;Matthew and Son&quot; both reached top 10 in the UK charts. Stevens&#x27; albums &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; (1970) and &quot;Teaser and the Firecat&quot; (1971) were certified triple platinum in the US. His 1972 album &quot;Catch Bull at Four&quot; went to No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spent weeks at the top of several other major charts. He earned ASCAP songwriting awards in 2005 and 2006 for &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot;, which has been a hit for four artists. His other hit songs include &quot;Father and Son&quot;, &quot;Wild World&quot;, &quot;Moonshadow&quot;, &quot;Peace Train&quot;, and &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot;.

Stevens converted to Islam in December 1977, and adopted the name Yusuf Islam the following year. In 1979, he auctioned his guitars for charity, and left his musical career to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community. He has since bought back at least one of the guitars he sold as a result of the efforts of his son, Yoriyos. Stevens was embroiled in a controversy regarding comments he made in 1989, about the fatwa placed on author Salman Rushdie in response to the publication of Rushdie&#x27;s novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;. He has explained the incident stating: &quot;I was cleverly framed by certain questions. I never supported the fatwa.&quot;

In 2006, he returned to pop music by releasing his first new studio album of new pop songs in 28 years, titled &quot;An Other Cup&quot;. With that release and subsequent ones, he dropped the surname &quot;Islam&quot; from the album cover art – using the stage name Yusuf as a mononym. In 2009, he released the album &quot;Roadsinger&quot; and, in 2014, he released the album &quot;Tell &#x27;Em I&#x27;m Gone&quot; and began his first US tour since 1978. His second North American tour since his resurgence, featuring 12 shows in intimate venues, ran from 12 September to 7 October 2016. In 2017, he released the album &quot;The Laughing Apple&quot;, now using the stage name Yusuf / Cat Stevens, using the Cat Stevens name for the first time in 39 years. In September 2020, he released &quot;Tea for the Tillerman 2&quot;, a reimagining of his album &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; to celebrate its 50th anniversary, and in June 2023, &quot;King of a Land&quot;, a new studio album.

==Life and career==
=== Early life (1948–1965) ===
Steven Demetre Georgiou, born on 21 July 1948 in the Marylebone area of London, was the youngest child of a Greek Cypriot father, Stavros Georgiou (1900–1978), and a Swedish mother, Ingrid Wickman (1915–1989). He has an older sister, Anita (b. 1937), and a brother, David Gordon. The family lived above the Moulin Rouge, a restaurant his parents operated on the north end of Shaftesbury Avenue, a short walk from Piccadilly Circus in the Soho theatre district of London. All family members worked in the restaurant. His parents divorced when he was about eight years old but continued to maintain the family restaurant and live above it. Stevens has a half-brother, George Georgiou, born in Greece, presumably from his father&#x27;s first marriage in Greece.

Although his father was Greek Orthodox and his mother was a Baptist, Georgiou was sent to St Joseph Roman Catholic Primary School, Macklin Street, which was closer to his father&#x27;s business on Drury Lane. Georgiou developed an interest in piano at a young age, eventually using the family baby grand piano to work out the chords, since no one else there played well enough to teach him. At 15, inspired by the popularity of the Beatles, he became interested in the guitar. He persuaded his father to pay £8 () for his first guitar, and he began playing it and writing songs. He occasionally escaped his family responsibilities by going to the rooftop above their home and listening to the tunes of the musicals drifting from around the corner on Denmark Street, then the centre of the British music industry. Stevens said that &quot;West Side Story&quot; particularly affected him and gave him a &quot;different view of life&quot;. With interests in both art and music, he and his mother moved to Gävle, Sweden, where he attended primary school (Solängsskolan) and started developing his drawing skills after being influenced by his uncle Hugo Wickman, a painter. They subsequently returned to England.

He attended other local West End schools, where he says he was constantly in trouble and did poorly in everything but art. He was called &#x27;the artist boy&#x27; and said, &quot;I was beat up, but I was noticed&quot;. He took a one-year course at Hammersmith School of Art, considering a career as a cartoonist. Though he enjoyed art (his later record albums featured his original artwork), he decided to pursue a musical career. He began performing under the name &quot;Steve Adams&quot; in 1965 while at Hammersmith. At that point, his goal was to become a songwriter. As well as the Beatles, other musicians who influenced him were the Kinks, Bob Dylan, Nina Simone, blues artists Lead Belly and Muddy Waters, Biff Rose (particularly Rose&#x27;s first album), Leo Kottke and Paul Simon. He also sought to emulate composers of musicals, such as Ira Gershwin and Leonard Bernstein. In 1965, he signed a publishing deal with Ardmore &amp; Beechwood and recorded several demos, including &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot;.

===Musical career (1966–1978)===
====Early musical career====

Georgiou began performing his songs in London coffee houses and pubs. At first he tried to form a band, but realised he preferred performing solo. Thinking his birth name might be difficult to remember, he chose the stage name Cat Stevens, partly because a girlfriend said he had eyes like a cat, but mainly because &quot;I couldn&#x27;t imagine anyone going to the record store and asking for &#x27;that Steven Demetre Georgiou album&#x27;. And in England, and I was sure in America, they loved animals.&quot;

In 1966, at age 18, he was heard by manager/producer Mike Hurst, formerly of British vocal group the Springfields. Hurst arranged for him to record a demo and helped him get a record deal. Stevens&#x27;s first singles were hits: &quot;I Love My Dog&quot; reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart; and &quot;Matthew and Son&quot;, the title song from his debut album, reached number 2 in the UK. &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Get Me a Gun&quot; was his second UK top 10 single, reaching number 6, and the album &quot;Matthew and Son&quot;, released in March 1967, reached number 7 on the UK Albums Chart.

Over the next two years, Stevens recorded and toured with an eclectic group of artists ranging from Jimi Hendrix to Engelbert Humperdinck. He was considered a fresh-faced teen star, placing several single releases in the British pop music charts. Some of that success was attributed to the pirate radio station Wonderful Radio London, which gained him fans by playing his records. In August 1967, he was one of several recording artists who had benefited from the station to broadcast messages during its final hour to mourn its closure.

His December 1967 album &quot;New Masters&quot; failed to chart in the United Kingdom. The album is now most notable for &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot;, a song he sold for £30 () to P. P. Arnold and which became a massive hit for her and an international hit for Keith Hampshire, Rod Stewart, James Morrison and Sheryl Crow. Forty years after he recorded the first demo of the song, it earned him back-to-back ASCAP &quot;Songwriter of the Year&quot; awards, in 2005 and 2006.

====Tuberculosis====
Stevens contracted tuberculosis in 1969 and was close to death at the time of his admission to the King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, West Sussex. He spent months recuperating in the hospital and a year of convalescence. During this time, Stevens began to question aspects of his life and spirituality. He later said, &quot;To go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut.&quot;

He took up meditation, yoga, and metaphysics, read about other religions and became a vegetarian. As a result of his serious illness and long convalescence and as a part of his spiritual awakening and questioning, he wrote as many as 40 songs, many of which would appear on his albums in later years.

====Changes in musical sound after illness====
The lack of success of Stevens&#x27; second album mirrored a difference of personal tastes in musical direction. He felt a growing resentment of producer Mike Hurst&#x27;s attempts to re-create the style of his debut album, with heavy-handed orchestration and over-production, rather than the folk rock sound Stevens was attempting to produce. He admits having purposely sabotaged his own contract with Hurst by making outlandishly expensive orchestral demands and threatening legal action, which achieved his goal: to be released from his contract with Deram Records, a sub-label of Decca Records.

On regaining his health at home after his release from the hospital, Stevens recorded some of his newly written songs on his tape recorder and played his changing sound for several new record executives. He hired an agent, Barry Krost, who arranged an audition with Chris Blackwell of Island Records. Blackwell offered him a &quot;chance to record [his songs] whenever and with whomever he liked and, more importantly to Cat, however he liked&quot;. With Krost&#x27;s recommendation, Stevens signed Paul Samwell-Smith, previously the bassist of the Yardbirds, as his new producer.

====Height of popularity====

Samwell-Smith paired Stevens with guitarist Alun Davies, who was at that time working as a session musician. Davies was the more-experienced veteran of two albums that had already begun to explore the emerging genres of skiffle and folk rock music. Davies was also thought to be a perfect fit with Stevens, particularly for his &quot;fingerwork&quot; on the guitar, harmonising, and backing vocals. They originally met just to record &quot;Mona Bone Jakon&quot; in 1970, but soon developed a friendship. Davies, like Stevens, was a perfectionist, appearing at all sound checks to be sure that all the equipment and sound were prepared for each concert.

The first single released from &quot;Mona Bone Jakon&quot; was &quot;Lady D&#x27;Arbanville&quot;, which Stevens wrote about his young American girlfriend Patti D&#x27;Arbanville. The record had a madrigal sound, unlike most music played on pop radio, with djembes and bass in addition to Stevens&#x27; and Davies&#x27; guitars. It reached number eight in the UK and was the first of his hits to get real airplay in the US. The single sold over one million copies and earned him a gold record in 1971. Other songs written for D&#x27;Arbanville included &quot;Maybe You&#x27;re Right&quot; and &quot;Just Another Night&quot;. &quot;Pop Star&quot;, a song about his experience as a teen star, and &quot;Katmandu&quot;, with Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel playing flute, were also featured. &quot;Mona Bone Jakon&quot; was an early example of the solo singer-songwriter album format that was becoming popular for other artists as well. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine compared its popularity with that of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;, saying it was played &quot;across the board, across radio formats&quot;.
&quot;Mona Bone Jakon&quot; was the precursor of Stevens&#x27; international breakthrough album, &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot;, which became a Top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; hit. Within six months of its release, it had sold over 500,000 copies, attaining gold record status in the United Kingdom and the United States. The combination of Stevens&#x27; new folk rock style and accessible lyrics, which spoke of everyday situations and problems, mixed with the beginning of spiritual questions about life, remained in his music from then on. The album features the Top 20 single &quot;Wild World&quot;; a parting song after D&#x27;Arbanville moved on. &quot;Wild World&quot; has been credited as the song that gave &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; &#x27;enough kick&#x27; to get it played on FM radio. The head of Island Records, Chris Blackwell, was quoted as calling it &quot;the best album we&#x27;ve ever released&quot;. Other album tracks include &quot;Hard-Headed Woman&quot;, and &quot;Father and Son&quot; – sung by Stevens in baritone and tenor, portraying the struggle between fathers and sons who contrast their personal choices in life. In 2001, this album was certified by the RIAA as a Multi-Platinum record, having sold three million copies in the United States at that time. It is ranked at No. 206 in the 2003 list of &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

After his relationship with D&#x27;Arbanville ended, Stevens noted the effect it had on his writing, saying, &quot;Everything I wrote while I was away was in a transitional period and reflects that. Like Patti. A year ago we split; I had been with her for two years. What I write about Patti and my family... when I sing the songs now, I learn strange things. I learn the meanings of my songs late ...&quot;
Having established a signature sound, Stevens enjoyed a string of successes in the following years. 1971&#x27;s &quot;Teaser and the Firecat&quot; album reached number two and achieved gold record status within three weeks of its release in the United States. It yielded several hits, including &quot;Peace Train&quot;, &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot;, and &quot;Moonshadow&quot;. The album was also certified by the RIAA as a Multi-Platinum record in 2001, with over three million sold in the United States through that time. When interviewed on a Boston radio station, Stevens said about &quot;Teaser and the Firecat&quot;:

I get the tune and then I just keep on singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It&#x27;s kind of a hypnotic state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want ...&#x27;Moonshadow&#x27;? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, to get away from a few things. And I was dancin&#x27; on the rocks there ... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin&#x27; and splashin&#x27;. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin&#x27; and singin&#x27; and I sang that song and it stayed. It&#x27;s just the kind of moment that you want to find when you&#x27;re writin&#x27; songs.

For seven months, in 1971 and 1972, Stevens was romantically linked to popular singer Carly Simon, while both were being produced by Samwell-Smith. During that time, they each wrote songs for, and about, one another. Simon wrote and recorded at least two Top 50 songs, &quot;Legend in Your Own Time&quot; and &quot;Anticipation&quot; about Stevens. He reciprocated with a song to her, written after their romance, titled &quot;Sweet Scarlet&quot;.

His next album, &quot;Catch Bull at Four&quot;, released in 1972, was his most rapidly successful album in the United States, reaching gold record status in 15 days and holding the number-one position for three weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and fifteen weeks at number one in the Australian ARIA Charts.

====Film and television soundtracks====
In July 1970, Stevens recorded one of his songs, &quot;But I Might Die Tonight&quot;, for the Jerzy Skolimowski film &quot;Deep End&quot;. He contributed two songs to the 1971 film &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;, but was annoyed when director Hal Ashby decided to use the original demos instead of allowing Stevens to finish them. The film used seven other Stevens songs as well but, perhaps because of the dispute, the soundtrack album was not released until 2007.

After his religious conversion in the late 1970s, Stevens stopped granting permission for his songs to be used in films. However, almost 20 years later, in 1997, the film &quot;Rushmore&quot; received his permission to use his songs &quot;Here Comes My Baby&quot; and &quot;The Wind&quot;; this showed a new willingness on his part to release music from his Western &quot;pop star&quot; days. In 2000, &quot;Peace Train&quot; was included in the movie &quot;Remember the Titans&quot;, and &quot;Almost Famous&quot; used the song &quot;The Wind&quot;. In 2006 &quot;Peace Train&quot; featured in the soundtrack to &quot;We Are Marshall&quot;.

====Later recordings====

Subsequent releases in the 1970s also did well on the charts and in ongoing sales, although they did not touch the success Stevens had from 1970 to 1973. In 1973, Stevens moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as a tax exile from the United Kingdom; however, he later donated the money to UNESCO. During that time he created the album &quot;Foreigner&quot;, which was a departure from the music that had brought him to the height of his fame. It differed in several respects: it was entirely written by Stevens; he dropped his band; and, with the exception of some guitar on the title track and &quot;100 I Dream&quot;, he produced the record without the assistance of Samwell-Smith, who had played a large role in catapulting him to fame.

In June 1974, while in Australia, Stevens was presented with a plaque representing the sale of forty gold records, the largest number ever presented to an artist in Australia.

Stevens released the albums &quot;Buddha and the Chocolate Box&quot; in 1974, and &quot;Numbers&quot; in 1975.

In April 1977, his &quot;Izitso&quot; album updated his pop rock and folk rock style with the extensive use of synthesisers, giving it a more synthpop style. &quot;Was Dog a Doughnut&quot;, in particular, was an early techno-pop fusion track and a precursor to the 1980s electro music genre, making early use of a music sequencer. &quot;Izitso&quot; included his last chart hit, &quot;(Remember the Days of the) Old Schoolyard&quot;, an early synthpop song that used a polyphonic synthesiser; it was a duet with fellow UK singer Elkie Brooks.

His final original album under the name Cat Stevens was &quot;Back to Earth&quot;, released in late 1978. It was also the first album produced by Samwell-Smith since the peak in Stevens&#x27; single album sales in the early 1970s. Several compilation albums were released before and after he stopped recording. After Stevens left Decca Records, they bundled his first two albums together as a set, hoping to ride the commercial tide of his early success; later his newer labels did the same, and Stevens also released compilations. The most successful of the compilation albums was the 1975 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; which has sold over 4 million copies in the United States. In May 2003, he received his first Platinum Europe Award from the IFPI for &quot;Remember Cat Stevens: The Ultimate Collection&quot;, indicating over one million European sales.

===Religious conversion===
While on holiday in Marrakesh, Stevens was intrigued by the sound of the adhān, the Islamic ritual call to prayer, which was explained to him as &quot;music for God&quot;. Stevens said, &quot;I thought, music for God? I&#x27;d never heard that before – I&#x27;d heard of music for money, music for fame, music for personal power, but music for God!?&quot;

In 1976, Stevens nearly drowned off the coast of Malibu, California, and said he shouted, &quot;Oh, God! If you save me I will work for you.&quot; He stated that, immediately afterwards, a wave appeared and carried him back to shore. This brush with death intensified his long-held quest for spiritual truth. He had looked into &quot;Buddhism, Zen, I Ching, numerology, tarot cards, and astrology&quot;. Stevens&#x27; brother David Gordon, a convert to Judaism, brought him a copy of the Qur&#x27;an as a birthday gift from a trip to Jerusalem.

Stevens said on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;: &quot;I would never have picked up the Qur&#x27;an myself as a free spirit; I was more aligned to my father&#x27;s Greek Orthodox beliefs.&quot; His brother&#x27;s timely gift was quickly absorbed and he was taken with its content, soon beginning his transition and conversion to Islam, which would change forever his private and professional life.

During the time he was studying the Qur&#x27;an, Stevens began to identify more and more with the story of Joseph, a man bought and sold in the market place, which is how he said he had increasingly felt within the music business. Regarding his conversion, in his 2006 interview with Alan Yentob, he stated, &quot;To some people, it may have seemed like an enormous jump, but for me, it was a gradual move to this.&quot; And, in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine interview, he reaffirmed that, saying, &quot;I had found the spiritual home I&#x27;d been seeking for most of my life. And if you listen to my music and lyrics, like &quot;Peace Train&quot; and &quot;On The Road To Find Out&quot;, it clearly shows my yearning for direction and the spiritual path I was travelling.&quot;

Stevens formally converted to Islam on 23 December 1977, taking the name Yusuf Islam in 1978. Yusuf is the Arabic rendition of the name Joseph; he stated that he &quot;always loved the name Joseph&quot; and was particularly drawn to the story of Joseph in the Qur&#x27;an. Although he discontinued his pop career, he was persuaded to perform one last time before what became his 25-year musical hiatus. Appearing with his hair freshly shorn and an untrimmed beard, he headlined a charity concert on 22 November 1979 in Wembley Stadium to benefit UNICEF&#x27;s International Year of the Child. The concert closed with his performance along with David Essex, Alun Davies, and Islam&#x27;s brother, David Gordon, who wrote the finale song &quot;Child for a Day&quot;.

After a brief engagement to Louise Wightman, Islam married Fauzia Mubarak Ali on 7 September 1979, at Regent&#x27;s Park Mosque in London. They have one son, four daughters, and nine grandchildren; a second son died in infancy. They have a home in London while currently preferring to spend a major part of each year in Dubai.

===Life as Yusuf Islam (1978–present)===
====Muslim faith and musical career====

Following his conversion to Islam, he abandoned his musical career for nearly two decades. When he became a Muslim in 1977, the imam at his mosque told him that it was fine to continue as a musician, as long as the songs were morally acceptable. However, because others said that &quot;it was all prohibited&quot;, he decided to avoid the question by ceasing to perform. He has said that there was &quot;a combination of reasons, really&quot;, and that the continuing demands of the music business had been &quot;becoming a chore, and not an inspiration anymore&quot;.

In a 2004 interview on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, he said &quot;A lot of people would have loved me to keep singing. You come to a point where you have sung, more or less... your whole repertoire and you want to get down to the job of living. You know, up until that point, I hadn&#x27;t had a life. I&#x27;d been searching, been on the road.&quot;

Estimating in January 2007 that he was continuing to earn approximately US$1.5 million a year from his Cat Stevens music, he said he would use his accumulated wealth and ongoing earnings from his music career for philanthropic and educational causes in the Muslim community of London and elsewhere. In 1983, he founded the Islamia Primary School in Brondesbury Park, later moved to Salusbury Road, in the north London area of Queen&#x27;s Park and, soon after, founded several Muslim secondary schools; in 1992, he set up The Association of Muslim Schools (AMS-UK), a charity that brought together all the Muslim schools in the UK. He is also the founder and chairman of the &quot;Small Kindness&quot; charity, which initially assisted famine victims in Africa and now supports thousands of orphans and families in the Balkans, Indonesia, and Iraq. He was chairman of the charity Muslim Aid from 1985 to 1993.

====Salman Rushdie controversy====

In 1989, following an address by Islam to students at London&#x27;s Kingston Polytechnic (now Kingston University), where he was asked about the fatwa calling for the killing of Salman Rushdie, author of the novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, Islam made a series of comments that appeared to show support for the fatwa. He stated, &quot;He (Rushdie) must be killed. The Qur&#x27;an makes it clear – if someone defames the prophet, then he must die.&quot; He released a statement the following day denying that he supported vigilantism and claiming that he had merely recounted the Islamic Sharia law punishment for blasphemy. Subsequently, he commented in a 1989 interview on Australian television that Rushdie should be killed and stated he would rather burn Rushdie instead of an effigy. In a statement in the FAQ section of one of his websites, Islam asserted that while he regretted the comments, he was joking and that the show was improperly edited.

In the years since these comments, he has repeatedly denied ever calling for the death of Rushdie or supporting the fatwa. Appearing on BBC&#x27;s Desert Island Discs on 27 September 2020, Yusuf claimed clever &quot;sharp-toothed&quot; journalists had framed his fatwa comment in a misleading way. In a 2007 letter to the editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Rushdie complained of what he believed was Islam&#x27;s attempts to &quot;rewrite his past&quot;, and called his claims of innocence &quot;rubbish&quot;.

On 12 August 2022, Salman Rushdie suffered a knife attack as he was about to give a public lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York, United States. In response to the attack, Yusuf tweeted, &quot;Saddened and shocked to learn about the horrific act on Salman Rushdie my wish is for us all to live in peace. May God grant him and every one else who has suffered from the manic pandemic of violence in this world, a full recovery. Peace&quot;.

====11 September attacks====
Immediately following the September 11 attacks on the United States, he said:

He appeared on videotape on a VH1 pre-show for the October 2001 Concert for New York City, condemning the attacks and singing his song &quot;Peace Train&quot; for the first time in public in more than 20 years, as an a cappella version. He also donated a portion of his box-set royalties to the fund for victims&#x27; families and the rest to orphans in underdeveloped countries. During the same year, he dedicated time and effort in joining the Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism, an organisation that worked towards battling misconceptions and acts against others because of their religious beliefs or their racial identity (or both), after many Muslims reported a backlash against them due in part to the grief caused by the events in the United States on 11 September.

====Denial of entry into the United States====
On 21 September 2004, Islam was on a United Airlines flight from London to Washington, travelling to a meeting with American entertainer Dolly Parton, who had recorded &quot;Peace Train&quot; several years earlier and was planning to include another Cat Stevens song on an upcoming album. While the plane was in flight, his name was flagged as being on the No Fly List. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers alerted the United States Transportation Security Administration, which then diverted his flight to Bangor, Maine, where he was detained by officers from the Department of Homeland Security.

The following day, he was denied entry and flown back to the United Kingdom. A spokesman for Homeland Security claimed there were &quot;concerns of ties he may have to potential terrorist-related activities&quot;. The Israeli government had deported Islam in 2000 over allegations that he provided funding to the Palestinian organisation Hamas, but he denied doing so knowingly. Islam stated &quot;I have never knowingly supported or given money to Hamas&quot;. &quot;At the time I was reported to have done it, I didn&#x27;t know such a group existed. Some people give a political interpretation to charity. We were horrified at how people were suffering in the Holy Land.&quot;

However, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) added him to a &quot;watch list&quot; which provoked an international controversy and led the British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw to complain personally to the United States Secretary of State Colin Powell at the United Nations. Powell responded by stating that the watchlist was under review, adding, &quot;I think we have that obligation to review these matters to see if we are right&quot;.

Islam believed his inclusion on a &quot;watch list&quot; may have simply been an error: a mistaken identification of him for a man with the same name, but different spelling. On 1 October 2004 he requested the removal of his name, &quot;I remain bewildered by the decision of the US authorities to refuse me entry to the United States&quot;. According to his statement, the man on the list was named &quot;Youssef Islam&quot;, indicating that Islam was not the suspected terrorism supporter. Romanisation of Arabic names can easily result in different spellings: the transliteration of Yusuf gives rise to a dozen spellings.

Two years later, in December 2006, Islam was admitted without incident into the United States for several radio concert performances and interviews to promote his new record. He said of the incident at the time, &quot;No reason was ever given, but being asked to repeat the spelling of my name again and again, made me think it was a fairly simple mistake of identity. Rumours which circulated after made me imagine otherwise.&quot;

Islam wrote a song about his 2004 exclusion from the US, titled &quot;Boots and Sand&quot;, recorded in 2008 and featuring Paul McCartney, Dolly Parton, and Terry Sylvester.

====Libel cases====
=====Lawsuit over News UK newspaper reports that he had supported terrorism=====
In October 2004, &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspapers voiced their support for Yusuf&#x27;s exclusion from the United States and claimed that he had supported terrorism. He sued for libel and received an out-of-court financial settlement from the newspapers, which both published apology statements saying that he had never supported terrorism and mentioning that he had recently been given a Man of Peace award from the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates. However, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; managing editor Richard Caseby said that while there was an &quot;agreed settlement&quot;, they &quot;always denied liability&quot; and &quot;disagreed with Cat Stevens&#x27; lawyers interpretation&quot;, but took a &quot;pragmatic view&quot; of the lawsuit.

Yusuf responded that he was &quot;delighted by the settlement [which] helps vindicate my character and good name. ... It seems to be the easiest thing in the world these days to make scurrilous accusations against Muslims and, in my case, it directly impacts on my relief work and damages my reputation as an artist. The harm done is often difficult to repair&quot;, and added that he intended to donate the financial award given to him by the court to help orphans of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. He wrote about the experience in a newspaper article titled &quot;A Cat in a Wild World&quot;.

=====Lawsuit about allegations that he would not talk to unveiled women=====
On 18 July 2008, Islam received substantial undisclosed damages from the World Entertainment News Network following their publication of a story which claimed that the singer refused to speak to unveiled women. The allegations first surfaced in the German newspaper BZ after Islam&#x27;s trip to Berlin in March 2007 to collect the Echo music award for &quot;life achievements as musician and ambassador between cultures&quot;. Once again he was awarded damages after the World Entertainment News Network allowed an article to be published on Contactmusic.com alleging that he would not speak to unveiled women with the exception of his wife. His solicitor said &quot;he was made out to be &#x27;so sexist and bigoted that he refused at an awards ceremony to speak to or even acknowledge any women who were not wearing a veil. The news agency apologised and issued a statement saying that Islam has never had any problem in working with women and that he has never required a third party to function as an intermediary at work. The money from this lawsuit went to his &quot;Small Kindness&quot; Charity.

On his website, he discussed the false allegation, saying,
===Return to music===
====1990s–2006: as Yusuf Islam====

Islam gradually resumed his musical career in the 1990s. These initial recordings did not include any musical instruments other than percussion, and they featured lyrics about Islamic themes, some in spoken word or hamd form. He invested in building his own recording studio, which he named Mountain of Light Studios in the late 1990s, and he was featured as a guest singer on &quot;God Is the Light&quot;, a song on an album of nasheeds by the group Raihan. In addition, he invited and collaborated with other Muslim singers, including Canadian artist Dawud Wharnsby.

After Islam&#x27;s friend Irfan Ljubijankić, the Foreign Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was killed by a Serbian rocket attack, Islam appeared at a 1997 benefit concert in Sarajevo and recorded a benefit album named after a song written by Ljubijankić, &quot;I Have No Cannons That Roar&quot;.

Realising there were few educational resources designed to teach children about the Islamic religion, Islam wrote and produced a children&#x27;s album, &quot;A Is for Allah&quot;, in 2000 with the assistance of South African singer-songwriter Zain Bhikha. The title song was one Islam had written years before to introduce his first child to both the religion and the Arabic alphabet. He also established his own record label, &quot;Jamal Records&quot;, and Mountain of Light Productions, and he donates a percentage of his projects&#x27; proceeds to his Small Kindness charity, whose name is taken from the Qur&#x27;an.

On the occasion of the 2000 re-release of his Cat Stevens albums, at the urging of his label rep Sujata, Islam agreed to interviews with the media to tell his story and reconnect with his fans. Islam explained that he had stopped performing in English due to his misunderstanding of the Islamic faith. &quot;This issue of music in Islam is not as cut-and-dried as I was led to believe ... I relied on heresy, that was perhaps my mistake.&quot; He also participated in the first documentary on his life for a two-part VH1 &quot;Behind the Music&quot;.

Islam has reflected that his decision to leave the Western pop-music business was perhaps too quick with too little communication for his fans. For most it was a surprise, and even his long-time guitarist Alun Davies said in later interviews that he had not believed that his friend would actually go through with it after his many forays into other religions throughout their relationship. Islam himself has said the &quot;cut&quot; between his former life and his life as a Muslim might have been too quick, and too severe, and that more people might have been better informed about Islam, and given an opportunity to better understand it, and himself, if he had simply removed those items that were considered &quot;harām&quot;, in his performances, allowing him to express himself musically and educate listeners through his music without violating any religious constraints.

In 2003, after repeated encouragement from within the Muslim world, Islam once again recorded &quot;Peace Train&quot; for a compilation CD, which also included performances by David Bowie and Paul McCartney. He performed &quot;Wild World&quot; in Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 46664 concert with his earlier collaborator, Peter Gabriel, the first time he had publicly performed in English in 25 years.

In December 2004, he and Ronan Keating released a new version of &quot;Father and Son&quot;: the song entered the charts at number two, behind Band Aid 20&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; They also produced a video of the pair walking between photographs of fathers and sons, while singing the song. The proceeds of &quot;Father and Son&quot; were donated to the Band Aid charity. Keating&#x27;s former group, Boyzone, had a hit with the song a decade earlier. As he had been persuaded before, Islam contributed to the song, because the proceeds were marked for charity.

On 21 April 2005, Islam gave a short talk before a scheduled musical performance in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on the anniversary of the prophet Muhammad&#x27;s birthday. He said: There is a great deal of ignorance in the world about Islam today, and we hope to communicate with the help of something more refined than lectures and talks. Our recordings are particularly appealing to the young, having used songs as well as Qur&#x27;an verses with pleasing sound effects ...

Islam observed that there are no real guidelines about instruments and no references about the business of music in the Qur&#x27;an, and that Muslim travellers first brought the guitar to Moorish Spain. He noted that Muhammad was fond of celebrations, as in the case of the birth of a child, or a traveller arriving after a long journey. Thus, Islam concluded that healthy entertainment was acceptable within limitations, and that he now felt that it was no sin to perform with the guitar. Music, he now felt, is uplifting to the soul; something sorely needed in troubled times. At that point, he was joined by several young male singers who sang backing vocals and played a drum, with Islam as lead singer and guitarist. They performed two songs, both half in Arabic and half in English; &quot;Tala&#x27;a Al-Badru Alayna&quot;, an old song in Arabic which Islam recorded with a folk sound to it, and another song, &quot;The Wind East and West&quot;, which was newly written by Islam and featured a distinct R&amp;B sound.

With this performance, Islam began slowly to integrate instruments into both older material from his Cat Stevens era (some with slight lyrical changes) and new songs, both those known to the Muslim communities around the world and some that have the same Western flair from before with a focus on new topics and another generation of listeners.

In a 2005 press release, he explained his revived recording career:


In early 2005, Islam released a new song, titled &quot;Indian Ocean&quot;, about the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami disaster. The song featured Indian composer/producer A. R. Rahman, a-ha keyboard player Magne Furuholmen and Travis drummer Neil Primrose. Proceeds of the single went to help orphans in Banda Aceh, one of the areas worst affected by the tsunami, through Islam&#x27;s Small Kindness charity. At first, the single was released only through several online music stores but later featured on the compilation album &quot;Cat Stevens: Gold&quot;. &quot;I had to learn my faith and look after my family, and I had to make priorities. But now I&#x27;ve done it all and there&#x27;s a little space for me to fill in the universe of music again.&quot;

On 28 May 2005, Islam delivered a keynote speech and performed at the Adopt-A-Minefield Gala in Düsseldorf. The Adopt-A-Minefield charity, under the patronage of Paul McCartney, works internationally to raise awareness and funds to clear landmines and rehabilitate landmine survivors. Islam attended as part of an honorary committee which also included George Martin, Richard Branson, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Klaus Voormann, Christopher Lee and others.

In mid-2005, Islam played guitar for the Dolly Parton album &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; on her version of his &quot;Where Do the Children Play?&quot; (Parton had also covered &quot;Peace Train&quot; a few years earlier.)

Islam has credited his then 21-year-old son Muhammad Islam, also a musician and artist, for his return to secular music, when the son brought a guitar back into the house, which Islam began playing. Muhammad&#x27;s professional name is Yoriyos and his debut album was released in February 2007. Yoriyos created the art on Islam&#x27;s album &quot;An Other Cup&quot;, something that Cat Stevens did for his own albums in the 1970s.

In May 2006, in anticipation of his forthcoming new pop album, the BBC1 programme &quot;Imagine&quot; aired a 49-minute documentary with Alan Yentob called &quot;Yusuf: The Artist formerly Known as Cat Stevens&quot;. This documentary film features rare audio and video clips from the late 1960s and 1970s, as well as an extensive interview with Islam, his brother David Gordon, several record executives, Bob Geldof, Dolly Parton, and others outlining his career as Cat Stevens, his conversion and emergence as Yusuf Islam, and his return to music in 2006. There are clips of him singing in the studio when he was recording &quot;An Other Cup&quot; as well as a few 2006 excerpts of him on guitar singing a few verses of Cat Stevens songs including &quot;The Wind&quot; and &quot;On the Road to Find Out&quot;.

In December 2006, Islam was one of the artists who performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, in honour of the prize winners, Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank. He performed the songs &quot;Midday (Avoid City After Dark)&quot;, &quot;Peace Train&quot;, and &quot;Heaven/Where True Love Goes&quot;. He also gave a concert in New York City that month as a &quot;Jazz at Lincoln Center&quot; event, recorded and broadcast by KCRW-FM radio, along with an interview by Nic Harcourt. Accompanying him, as in the Cat Stevens days, was Alun Davies, on guitar and vocals.

====2006–2017: as Yusuf====
=====2006–2008: &quot;An Other Cup&quot; and appearances=====
In March 2006, Islam finished recording his first all-new pop album since 1978. The album, &quot;An Other Cup&quot;, was released internationally in November 2006 on his own label, Ya Records (distributed by Polydor Records in the UK, and internationally by Atlantic Records)—the 40th anniversary of his first album, &quot;Matthew and Son&quot;. An accompanying single, called &quot;Heaven/Where True Love Goes&quot;, was also released. The album was produced with Rick Nowels, who has worked with Dido and Rod Stewart. The performer is noted as &quot;Yusuf&quot;, with a cover label identifying him as &quot;the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens&quot;. The art on the album is credited to Yoriyos. Islam wrote all of the songs except &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;, and recorded it in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Islam actively promoted this album, appearing on radio, television and in print interviews. In November 2006, he told the BBC, &quot;It&#x27;s me, so it&#x27;s going to sound like that of course ... This is the real thing ... When my son brought the guitar back into the house, you know, that was the turning point. It opened a flood of, of new ideas and music which I think a lot of people would connect with.&quot; Originally, he began to return only to his acoustic guitar as he had in the past, but his son encouraged him to &quot;experiment&quot;, which resulted in the purchase of a Stevie Ray Vaughan Fender Stratocaster in 2007.

Also in November 2006, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine was curious as to why the artist is credited as just his first name, &quot;Yusuf&quot; rather than &quot;Yusuf Islam&quot;. His response was &quot;Because &#x27;Islam&#x27; doesn&#x27;t have to be sloganised. The second name is like the official tag, but you call a friend by their first name. It&#x27;s more intimate, and to me that&#x27;s the message of this record.&quot; As for why the album sleeve says &quot;the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens&quot;, he responded, &quot;That&#x27;s the tag with which most people are familiar; for recognition purposes I&#x27;m not averse to that. For a lot of people, it reminds them of something they want to hold on to. That name is part of my history and a lot of the things I dreamt about as Cat Stevens have come true as Yusuf Islam.&quot;

Islam was asked by the Swiss periodical &quot;Das Magazin&quot; why the title of the album was &quot;An Other Cup&quot;, rather than &quot;Another Cup&quot;. The answer was that his breakthrough album, &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; in 1970, was decorated with Islam&#x27;s painting of a peasant sitting down to a cup of steaming drink on the land. He commented that the two worlds &quot;then, and now, are very different&quot;. His new album shows a steaming cup alone on this cover. His answer was that this was actually an &quot;other&quot; cup; something different; a bridge between the East and West, which he explained was his own perceived role. He added that, through him, &quot;Westerners might get a glimpse of the East, and Easterners, some understanding of the West. The cup, too, is important; it&#x27;s a meeting place, a thing meant to be shared.&quot;

On &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; in December 2006, he said, &quot;You know, the cup is there to be filled ... with whatever you want to fill it with. For those people looking for Cat Stevens, they&#x27;ll probably find him in this record. If you want to find [Yusuf] Islam, go a bit deeper, you&#x27;ll find him.&quot; He has since described the album as being &quot;over-produced&quot; and refers to &quot;An Other Cup&quot; as being a necessary hurdle he had to overcome before he could release his new album, &quot;Roadsinger&quot;.

In April 2007, BBC1 broadcast a concert given at the Porchester Hall by Islam as part of &quot;BBC Sessions&quot;, his first live performance in London in 28 years (the previous one being the UNICEF &quot;Year of the Child&quot; concert in 1979). He played several new songs along with some old ones like &quot;Father and Son&quot;, &quot;The Wind&quot;, &quot;Where Do the Children Play?&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Shy&quot;, &quot;Wild World&quot;, and &quot;Peace Train&quot;.

In July 2007, he performed at a concert in Bochum, Germany, in benefit of Archbishop Desmond Tutu&#x27;s Peace Centre in South Africa and the Milagro Foundation of Deborah and Carlos Santana. The audience included Nobel Laureates Mikhail Gorbachev, Desmond Tutu and other prominent global figures. He later appeared as the final act in the German leg of Live Earth in Hamburg performing some classic Cat Stevens songs and more recent compositions reflecting his concern for peace and child welfare. His set included Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Saturn&quot;, &quot;Peace Train&quot;, &quot;Where Do the Children Play?&quot;, &quot;Ruins&quot;, and &quot;Wild World&quot;. He performed at the Peace One Day concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 21 September 2007.
In 2008 Islam contributed the song &quot;Edge of Existence&quot; to the charity album &quot;Songs for Survival&quot;, in support of the indigenous rights organisation Survival International.

=====2009–2014: &quot;Roadsinger&quot;, &quot;My People&quot; and tours=====
In January 2009, Yusuf released a single in aid of children in Gaza, a rendition of the George Harrison song &quot;The Day the World Gets Round&quot;, along with the German bassist Klaus Voormann, who had formerly collaborated with The Beatles. To promote the new single, Voormann redesigned his famous Beatles &quot;Revolver&quot; album cover, drawing a picture of a young Cat Stevens along with himself and Harrison. Proceeds from the single were donated to charities and organisations including UNESCO, UNRWA, and the nonprofit group Save the Children, with the funds earmarked for Gaza children. Israeli Consul David Saranga criticised Yusuf for not dedicating the song to all of the children who are victims of the conflict, including Israeli children.

On 5 May 2009, Yusuf released &quot;Roadsinger&quot;, a new pop album recorded in 2008. The lead track, &quot;Thinking &#x27;Bout You&quot;, received its debut radio play on a BBC programme on 23 March 2009. Unlike &quot;An Other Cup&quot;, he promoted the new album with appearances on American television as well as in the UK. He appeared on &quot;The Chris Isaak Hour&quot; on the A&amp;E network in April 2009, performing live versions of his new songs, &quot;World O&#x27;Darkness&quot;, &quot;Boots and Sand&quot;, and &quot;Roadsinger&quot;. On 13 May he appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; in Los Angeles, and on 14 May, on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in New York City, performing the title song from the &quot;Roadsinger&quot; album. On 15 May, he appeared on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, performing &quot;Boots and Sand&quot; and &quot;Father and Son&quot;. On 24 May he appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot;, where he was interviewed and performed the title track of &quot;Roadsinger&quot;. On 15 August, he was one of many guests at Fairport Convention&#x27;s annual Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention where he performed five songs accompanied by Alun Davies, with Fairport Convention as his backing band.

A world tour was announced on his web site to promote the new album. He was scheduled to perform at an invitation-only concert at New York City&#x27;s Highline Ballroom on 3 May 2009 and to go on to Los Angeles, Chicago and Toronto, as well as some to-be-announced European venues. However, the New York appearance was postponed due to issues regarding his work visa. He appeared in May 2009 at Island Records&#x27; 50th Anniversary concert in London. In November and December 2009, Yusuf undertook his &quot;Guess I&#x27;ll Take My Time Tour&quot; which also showcased his musical play &quot;Moonshadow&quot;. The tour took him to Dublin, where he had a mixed reception; subsequently he was well received in Birmingham and Liverpool, culminating in an emotional performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In June 2010 he toured Australia for the first time in 36 years, and New Zealand for the first time ever.
On 30 October 2010, Yusuf appeared at Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert&#x27;s spoof Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in Washington, DC, singing alongside Ozzy Osbourne. Yusuf performed &quot;Peace Train&quot; and Ozzy performed &quot;Crazy Train&quot; at the same time, followed by The O&#x27;Jays performance of &quot;Love Train&quot;.

On 2 March 2011, Yusuf released his latest song, &quot;My People&quot;, as a free download available through his official website, as well as numerous other online outlets. Said to have been recorded at a studio located within a hundred yards of the site of the Berlin Wall, the song is inspired by a series of popular uprisings in the Arab world, known as the Arab Spring.

On 1 April 2011, he launched a new tour website (yusufinconcert.com) to commemorate his first European tour in over 36 years scheduled from 7 May to 2 June 2011. The ten-date tour visited Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium and cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, Oberhausen, Berlin, Munich, Rotterdam, Paris, Mannheim, Vienna and Brussels.

In May 2012, &quot;Moonshadow&quot;, a new musical featuring music from throughout his career opened at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne, Australia. The show received mixed reviews and closed four weeks early.

In October 2013, Yusuf was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for his work under the Cat Stevens name (this was his second nomination – the first being an unsuccessful nomination in 2005). He was selected and was inducted by Art Garfunkel in April 2014 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, where he performed &quot;Father and Son&quot;, &quot;Wild World&quot;, and &quot;Peace Train&quot;. A record of his travel from Dubai to New York is captured in an episode of the National Geographic Channel television show &quot;Ultimate Airport Dubai&quot; (season 2, episode 6), first aired in China on 17 January 2015. In this episode he talks about his difficulty in entering the US.

=====2014–2017: &quot;Tell &#x27;Em I&#x27;m Gone&quot;, &quot;He Was Alone&quot; and tours=====
On 15 September 2014, Yusuf announced the forthcoming release on 27 October 2014 of his new studio album, &quot;Tell &#x27;Em I&#x27;m Gone&quot;, and two short tours: a November 2014 (9-date) Europe tour and a December 2014 (6-date) North America tour, the latter being his first one since 1976. On 4 December 2014, he played to his first public US audience since the 1970s at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia.

Yusuf performed two shows in early 2015: on 27 February at the Viña del Mar Festival, Quinta Vergara, Viña del Mar, Chile and on 22 April at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay, area of Cardiff, Wales.

On 1 June 2016, Yusuf shared a new song called &quot;He Was Alone&quot; and its corresponding video. Part of his newly launched fundraising campaign for child refugees, #YouAreNotAlone, the song was inspired by a trip to southern Turkey&#x27;s camps for Syrian refugees. He performed the song live for the first time in a special charity concert, his first show in more than a year, on 14 June 2016 at the Westminster Central Hall in London.

On 26 July 2016, Yusuf announced he would be part of the Global Citizen Festival held on 24 September 2016 in Central Park, New York, New York.

On 9 August 2016, Yusuf announced &quot;A Cat&#x27;s Attic Tour&quot;, his second North American tour since 1978, beginning on 12 September 2016 at the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto and ending on 7 October 2016 at the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles. The string of 12 dates roughly coincides with the 50th anniversary of his first single, &quot;I Love My Dog&quot;, and would &quot;feature a limited run of stripped down, introspective performances.&quot; The tour included three shows in New York City (two shows at the Beacon Theatre and one show in Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival), his first shows in New York City since 1976. In keeping with his spirit of humanitarianism, he would be donating a portion of the revenue from each ticket sale towards his charity Small Kindness, as well as UNICEF and the International Rescue Committee in an effort to assist children affected by the current Syrian refugee crisis. The tour continued in the UK with shows in Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle and London. The London show took place at the Shaftesbury Theatre, only a block away from where he grew up.

==== 2017–present: as Yusuf / Cat Stevens, &quot;The Laughing Apple&quot;, &quot;TT2&quot; ====

On 15 September 2017, he released his fifteenth studio album, &quot;The Laughing Apple&quot;. The album is credited to &quot;Yusuf / Cat Stevens&quot; and is his first record under the Cat Stevens name since &quot;Back to Earth&quot; in 1978. The album earned him his first nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. In July 2018, Yusuf signed with BMG Rights Management, which will publish his songwriting credits worldwide and distribute nine of his studio albums. On 29 March 2019, Yusuf performed in Christchurch, New Zealand, at the National Remembrance Service for victims of the Christchurch mosque shootings.

On 3 March 2020, Yusuf played the Music for the Marsden benefit concert at the O2 Arena in London. On 28 May 2020, Yusuf announced his next album, &quot;Tea for the Tillerman 2&quot;, and it was released on 18 September 2020, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the original LP. Known as &quot;TT2&quot;, &quot;Tea for the Tillerman 2&quot; is a re-imagining and re-recording of the songs from the earlier album, with updated interpretations and arrangements. On 25 September 2020, Yusuf was the guest on the BBC&#x27;s Desert Island Discs. Yusuf is one of a small number of guests that have chosen their own music as a desert island choice, however he picked the Stevie Wonder Motown hit &#x27;As&#x27; for his favoured choice in front of his own recording, if only one could be saved.

Teaming up with Playing for Change, in 2021 Yusuf / Cat Stevens recorded a new version of &quot;Peace Train&quot; with over 25 musicians from 12 countries.

==== 2023: Yusuf / Cat Stevens - European Tour and &quot;King of a Land&quot; ====
In June 2023, Yusuf performed shows in Berlin, Hamburg, Rome, Marbella, and made his first ever appearance at Glastonbury Festival: on the 25 June 2023, he played the Pyramid Stage, performing songs including covering iconic Beatles hits and his Teacup album memories.

On 16 June 2023, he released &quot;King of a Land&quot;, a new studio album with children&#x27;s music and religious music influences.

<text>Danainae is a subfamily of the family Nymphalidae, the brush-footed butterflies. It includes the Daniadae, or milkweed butterflies, who lay their eggs on various milkweeds on which their larvae (caterpillars) feed, as well as the clearwing butterflies (Ithomiini), and the tellervini.

Some 300 species of Danainae exist worldwide. Most of the Danaini are found in tropical Asia and Africa, while the Ithomiini are diverse in the Neotropics. Tellervini are restricted to Australia and the Oriental region. Four species are found in North America: the monarch butterfly (&quot;Danaus plexippus&quot;), the queen (&quot;Danaus gilippus&quot;), the tropical milkweed butterfly (&quot;Lycorea cleobaea&quot;), and the soldier butterfly (or &quot;tropic queen&quot;, &quot;Danaus eresimus&quot;). Of these, the monarch is by far the most famous, being one of the most recognizable butterflies in the Americas.

==Taxonomy==
Milkweed butterflies are now classified as the subfamily Danainae within the family Nymphalidae; however, the previous family name Danaidae is still occasionally used. The fossil milkweed butterfly &quot;Archaeolycorea&quot; is known from the Oligocene or Miocene Tremembé Formation of Brazil. It provides evidence that the present milkweed butterflies originated more than 20–30 million years ago.

==Characteristics==

Larvae have thoracic tubercles and use plants within the family Apocynaceae that often contain latex-like compounds in the stem as hosts. Adults are aposematic (brightly colored as a warning signal).

==Threats==
Numerous wasps and tachinid flies are parasitoids of milkweed butterfly caterpillars.

The extensive modification of landscapes in the United States and Canada, large-scale use of pesticides, and increased deforestation in Mexico threaten the migratory monarch butterfly.

Loss of native plants, such as milkweed species, contributes to the declined population of the migratory monarch butterfly.

<text>&quot;The Raven&quot; is a narrative poem by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. First published in January 1845, the poem is often noted for its musicality, stylized language and supernatural atmosphere. It tells of a distraught lover who is paid a visit by a mysterious raven that repeatedly speaks a single word. The lover, often identified as a student, is lamenting the loss of his love, Lenore. Sitting on a bust of Pallas, the raven seems to further antagonize the protagonist with its repetition of the word &quot;&quot;. The poem makes use of folk, mythological, religious, and classical references.

Poe stated that he composed the poem in a logical and methodical manner, aiming to craft a piece that would resonate with both critical and popular audiences, as he elaborated in his follow-up essay in 1846, &quot;The Philosophy of Composition&quot;. The poem was inspired in part by a talking raven in the 1841 novel &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; by Charles Dickens. Poe based the complex rhythm and meter on Elizabeth Barrett&#x27;s poem &quot;Lady Geraldine&#x27;s Courtship&quot; and made use of internal rhyme as well as alliteration throughout.

&quot;The Raven&quot; was first attributed to Poe in print in the &quot;New York Evening Mirror&quot; on January 29, 1845. Its publication made Poe popular in his lifetime, although it did not bring him much financial success. The poem was soon reprinted, parodied, and illustrated. Critical opinion is divided as to the poem&#x27;s literary status, but it nevertheless remains one of the most famous poems ever written.

== Synopsis ==

&quot;The Raven&quot; follows an unnamed narrator on a dreary night in December who sits reading &quot;forgotten lore&quot; by the remains of a fire as a way to forget the death of his beloved Lenore. A &quot;tapping at [his] chamber door&quot; reveals nothing, but excites his soul to &quot;burning&quot;. The tapping is repeated, slightly louder, and he realizes it is coming from his window. When he goes to investigate, a raven flutters into his chamber. Paying no attention to the man, the raven perches on a bust of Pallas above the door.

Amused by the raven&#x27;s comically serious disposition, the man asks that the bird tell him its name. The raven&#x27;s only answer is &quot;Nevermore&quot;. The narrator is surprised that the raven can talk, though at this point it has said nothing further. The narrator remarks to himself that his &quot;friend&quot; the raven will soon fly out of his life, just as &quot;other friends have flown before&quot; along with his previous hopes. As if answering, the raven responds again with &quot;Nevermore&quot;. The narrator reasons that the bird learned the word &quot;Nevermore&quot; from some &quot;unhappy master&quot; and that it is the only word it knows.

Even so, the narrator pulls his chair directly in front of the raven, determined to learn more about it. He thinks for a moment in silence, and his mind wanders back to his lost Lenore. He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore. The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories. The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a &quot;thing of evil&quot; and a &quot;prophet&quot;. Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical &quot;Nevermore&quot;, he is enraged, and, calling the bird a liar, commands it to return to the &quot;Plutonian shore&quot;—but it does not move. At the time of the poem&#x27;s narration, the raven &quot;still is sitting&quot; on the bust of Pallas. The raven casts a shadow on the chamber floor and the despondent narrator laments that out of this shadow his soul shall be &quot;lifted &#x27;nevermore.

== Analysis ==
Poe wrote the poem as a narrative, without intentional allegory or didacticism. The main theme of the poem is one of undying devotion. The narrator experiences a perverse conflict between desire to forget and desire to remember. He seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss. The narrator assumes that the word &quot;Nevermore&quot; is the raven&#x27;s &quot;only stock and store&quot;, and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, knowing what the answer will be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss. Poe leaves it unclear whether the raven actually knows what it is saying or whether it really intends to cause a reaction in the poem&#x27;s narrator. The narrator begins as &quot;weak and weary&quot;, becomes regretful and grief-stricken, before passing into a frenzy and, finally, madness. Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of elegiac paraclausithyron, an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded, locked-out lover at the sealed door of his beloved.

=== Allusions ===

Poe says that the narrator is a young scholar. Though this is not explicitly stated in the poem, it is mentioned in &quot;The Philosophy of Composition&quot;. It is also suggested by the narrator reading books of &quot;lore&quot; as well as by the bust of Pallas Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom.

He is reading in the late night hours from &quot;many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore&quot;. Similar to the studies suggested in Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;Ligeia&quot;, this lore may be about the occult or black magic. This is also emphasized in the author&#x27;s choice to set the poem in December, a month which is traditionally associated with the forces of darkness. The use of the raven—the &quot;devil bird&quot;—also suggests this. This devil image is emphasized by the narrator&#x27;s belief that the raven is &quot;from the Night&#x27;s Plutonian shore&quot;, or a messenger from the afterlife, referring to Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.

Poe chose a raven as the central symbol in the story because he wanted a &quot;non-reasoning&quot; creature capable of speech. He decided on a raven, which he considered &quot;equally capable of speech&quot; as a parrot, because it matched the intended tone of the poem. Poe said the raven is meant to symbolize &quot;Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance&quot;. He was also inspired by Grip, the raven in &quot;Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of Eighty&quot; by Charles Dickens. One scene in particular bears a resemblance to &quot;The Raven&quot;: at the end of the fifth chapter of Dickens&#x27;s novel, Grip makes a noise and someone says, &quot;What was that—him tapping at the door?&quot; The response is, Tis someone knocking softly at the shutter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Staford Cremains / Ravens&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens&#x27;s raven could speak many words and had many comic turns, including the popping of a champagne cork, but Poe emphasized the bird&#x27;s more dramatic qualities. Poe had written a review of &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; for &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot; saying, among other things, that the raven should have served a more symbolic, prophetic purpose. The similarity did not go unnoticed: James Russell Lowell in his &quot;A Fable for Critics&quot; wrote the verse, &quot;Here comes Poe with his raven, like &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;/ Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge.&quot; The Free Library of Philadelphia has on display a taxidermied raven that is reputed to be the very one that Dickens owned and that helped inspire Poe&#x27;s poem.
Poe may also have been drawing upon various references to ravens in mythology and folklore. In Norse mythology, Odin possessed two ravens named Huginn and Muninn, representing thought and memory. According to Hebrew folklore, Noah sends a white raven to check conditions while on the ark. It learns that the floodwaters are beginning to dissipate, but it does not immediately return with the news. It is punished by being turned black and being forced to feed on carrion forever. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, a raven also begins as white before Apollo punishes it by turning it black for delivering a message of a lover&#x27;s unfaithfulness. The raven&#x27;s role as a messenger in Poe&#x27;s poem may draw from those stories.

Poe mentions the Balm of Gilead, a reference to the Book of Jeremiah (8:22) in the Bible: &quot;Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?&quot; In that context, the Balm of Gilead is a resin used for medicinal purposes (suggesting, perhaps, that the narrator needs to be healed after the loss of Lenore). In 1 Kings 17:1–5 Elijah is said to be from Gilead, and to have been fed by ravens during a period of drought.

=== Poetic structure ===
The poem is made up of 18 stanzas of six lines each. Generally, the meter is trochaic octameter—eight trochaic feet per line, each foot having one stressed syllable followed by one unstressed syllable. The first line, for example (with ´ marking stressed syllables and ˘ marking unstressed):

Poe, however, claimed the poem was a combination of octameter acatalectic, heptameter catalectic, and tetrameter catalectic. The rhyme scheme is ABCBBB, or AA,B,CC,CB,B,B when accounting for internal rhyme. In every stanza, the &quot;B&quot; lines rhyme with the word &quot;nevermore&quot; and are catalectic, placing extra emphasis on the final syllable. The poem also makes heavy use of alliteration (&quot;Doubting, dreaming dreams ...&quot;). Twentieth-century American poet Daniel Hoffman suggested that the poem&#x27;s structure and meter is so formulaic that it is artificial, though its mesmeric quality overrides that.

Poe based the structure of &quot;The Raven&quot; on the complicated rhyme and rhythm of Elizabeth Barrett&#x27;s poem &quot;Lady Geraldine&#x27;s Courtship&quot;. Poe had reviewed Barrett&#x27;s work in the January 1845 issue of the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot; and said that &quot;her poetic inspiration is the highest—we can conceive of nothing more august. Her sense of Art is pure in itself.&quot; As is typical with Poe, his review also criticizes her lack of originality and what he considers the repetitive nature of some of her poetry. About &quot;Lady Geraldine&#x27;s Courtship&quot;, he said &quot;I have never read a poem combining so much of the fiercest passion with so much of the most delicate imagination.&quot;

== Publication history ==
Poe first brought &quot;The Raven&quot; to his friend and former employer George Rex Graham of &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in Philadelphia. Graham declined the poem, which may not have been in its final version, though he gave Poe $15 () as charity. Poe then sold the poem to &quot;The American Review&quot;, which paid him $9 () for it, and printed &quot;The Raven&quot; in its February 1845 issue under the pseudonym &quot;Quarles&quot;, a reference to the English poet Francis Quarles. The poem&#x27;s first publication with Poe&#x27;s name was in the &quot;Evening Mirror&quot; on January 29, 1845, as an &quot;advance copy&quot;. Nathaniel Parker Willis, editor of the &quot;Mirror&quot;, introduced it as &quot;unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent, sustaining of imaginative lift ... It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.&quot; Following this publication the poem appeared in periodicals across the United States, including the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; (February 4, 1845), &quot;Broadway Journal&quot; (vol. 1, February 8, 1845), &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; (vol. 11, March 1845), &quot;Literary Emporium&quot; (vol. 2, December 1845), &quot;Saturday Courier&quot;, 16 (July 25, 1846), and the &quot;Richmond Examiner&quot; (September 25, 1849).

The immediate success of &quot;The Raven&quot; prompted Wiley and Putnam to publish a collection of Poe&#x27;s prose called &quot;Tales&quot; in June 1845; it was his first book in five years. They also published a collection of his poetry called &quot;The Raven and Other Poems&quot; on November 19 which included a dedication to Barrett as &quot;the Noblest of her Sex&quot;. The small volume, his first book of poetry in 14 years, was 100 pages and sold for 31 cents. In addition to the title poem, it included &quot;The Valley of Unrest&quot;, &quot;Bridal Ballad&quot;, &quot;The City in the Sea&quot;, &quot;Eulalie&quot;, &quot;The Conqueror Worm&quot;, &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot; and 11 others. In the preface, Poe referred to them as &quot;trifles&quot; which had been altered without his permission as they made &quot;the rounds of the press&quot;.

=== Illustrators ===
Later publications of &quot;The Raven&quot; included artwork by well-known illustrators. Notably, in 1858 &quot;The Raven&quot; appeared in a British Poe anthology with illustrations by John Tenniel, the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; illustrator (&quot;The Poetical Works of Edgar Allan Poe: With Original Memoir&quot;, London: Sampson Low). &quot;The Raven&quot; was published independently with lavish woodcuts by Gustave Doré in 1884 (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers). Doré died before its publication. In 1875, a French edition with English and French text, &quot;Le Corbeau&quot;, was published with lithographs by Édouard Manet and translation by the symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé. Many 20th-century artists and contemporary illustrators created artworks and illustrations based on &quot;The Raven&quot;, including Edmund Dulac, István Orosz, and Ryan Price.

== Composition ==

Poe capitalized on the success of &quot;The Raven&quot; by following it up with his essay &quot;The Philosophy of Composition&quot; (1846), in which he detailed the poem&#x27;s creation. His description of its writing is probably exaggerated, though the essay serves as an important overview of Poe&#x27;s literary theory. He explains that every component of the poem is based on logic: the raven enters the chamber to avoid a storm (the &quot;midnight dreary&quot; in the &quot;bleak December&quot;), and its perch on a pallid white bust was to create visual contrast against the dark black bird. No aspect of the poem was an accident, he claims, but is based on total control by the author. Even the term &quot;Nevermore&quot;, he says, is used because of the effect created by the long vowel sounds (though Poe may have been inspired to use the word by the works of Lord Byron or Henry Wadsworth Longfellow). Poe had experimented with the long &quot;o&quot; sound throughout many other poems: &quot;no more&quot; in &quot;Silence&quot;, &quot;evermore&quot; in &quot;The Conqueror Worm&quot;. The topic itself, Poe says, was chosen because &quot;the death ... of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world.&quot; Told from &quot;the lips ... of a bereaved lover&quot; is best suited to achieve the desired effect. Beyond the poetics of it, the lost Lenore may have been inspired by events in Poe&#x27;s own life as well, either to the early loss of his mother, Eliza Poe, or the long illness endured by his wife, Virginia. Ultimately, Poe considered &quot;The Raven&quot; an experiment to &quot;suit at once the popular and critical taste&quot;, accessible to both the mainstream and high literary worlds. It is unknown how long Poe worked on &quot;The Raven&quot;; speculation ranges from a single day to ten years. Poe recited a poem believed to be an early version with an alternate ending of &quot;The Raven&quot; in 1843 in Saratoga, New York. An early draft may have featured an owl.

In the summer of 1844, when the poem was likely written, Poe, his wife, and mother-in-law were boarding at the farmhouse of Patrick Brennan in New York. The location of the house, which was demolished in 1888, has been a disputed point and, while there are two different plaques marking its supposed location on West 84th Street, it most likely stood where 206 West 84th Street is now.

== Critical reception ==
In part due to its dual printing, &quot;The Raven&quot; made Edgar Allan Poe a household name almost immediately, and turned Poe into a national celebrity. Readers began to identify poem with poet, earning Poe the nickname &quot;The Raven&quot;. The poem was soon widely reprinted, imitated, and parodied. Though it made Poe popular in his day, it did not bring him significant financial success. As he later lamented, &quot;I have made no money. I am as poor now as ever I was in my life—except in hope, which is by no means bankable&quot;.

&quot;The New World&quot; said, &quot;Everyone reads the Poem and praises it ... justly, we think, for it seems to us full of originality and power.&quot; &quot;The Pennsylvania Inquirer&quot; reprinted it with the heading &quot;A Beautiful Poem&quot;. Elizabeth Barrett wrote to Poe, &quot;Your &#x27;Raven&#x27; has produced a sensation, a fit o&#x27; horror, here in England. Some of my friends are taken by the fear of it and some by the music. I hear of persons haunted by &#x27;Nevermore&#x27;.&quot; Poe&#x27;s popularity resulted in invitations to recite &quot;The Raven&quot; and to lecture—in public and at private social gatherings. At one literary salon, a guest noted, &quot;to hear [Poe] repeat the Raven ... is an event in one&#x27;s life.&quot; It was recalled by someone who experienced it, &quot;He would turn down the lamps till the room was almost dark, then standing in the center of the apartment he would recite ... in the most melodious of voices ... So marvelous was his power as a reader that the auditors would be afraid to draw breath lest the enchanted spell be broken.&quot;

Parodies sprang up especially in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia and included &quot;The Craven&quot; by &quot;Poh!&quot;, &quot;The Gazelle&quot;, &quot;The Whippoorwill&quot;, and &quot;The Turkey&quot;. One parody, &quot;The Pole-Cat&quot;, caught the attention of Andrew Johnston, a lawyer who sent it on to Abraham Lincoln. Though Lincoln admitted he had &quot;several hearty laughs&quot;, he had not, at that point read &quot;The Raven&quot;. However, Lincoln eventually read and memorized the poem.

&quot;The Raven&quot; was praised by fellow writers William Gilmore Simms and Margaret Fuller, though it was denounced by William Butler Yeats, who called it &quot;insincere and vulgar ... its execution a rhythmical trick&quot;. Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson said, &quot;I see nothing in it.&quot; A critic for the &quot;Southern Quarterly Review&quot; wrote in July 1848 that the poem was ruined by &quot;a wild and unbridled extravagance&quot; and that minor things like a tapping at the door and a fluttering curtain would only affect &quot;a child who had been frightened to the verge of idiocy by terrible ghost stories&quot;. An anonymous writer going by the pseudonym &quot;Outis&quot; suggested in the &quot;New York Evening Mirror&quot; that &quot;The Raven&quot; was plagiarized from a poem called &quot;The Bird of the Dream&quot; by an unnamed author. The writer, who wrote the article as a response to Poe&#x27;s accusations of plagiarism against Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, showed 18 similarities between the poems. It has been suggested Outis was really Cornelius Conway Felton, if not Poe himself. After Poe&#x27;s death, his friend Thomas Holley Chivers said &quot;The Raven&quot; was plagiarized from one of his poems. In particular, he claimed to have been the inspiration for the meter of the poem as well as the refrain &quot;nevermore&quot;.

&quot;The Raven&quot; became one of the most popular targets for literary translators in Hungary; more than a dozen poets rendered it into Hungarian, including Mihály Babits, Dezső Kosztolányi, Árpád Tóth, and György Faludy. Balázs Birtalan wrote its from the raven&#x27;s point of view.

== Legacy ==

&quot;The Raven&quot; has influenced many modern works, including Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; in 1955, Bernard Malamud&#x27;s &quot;The Jewbird&quot; in 1963 and Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;The Parrot Who Met Papa&quot; in 1976. The process by which Poe composed &quot;The Raven&quot; influenced a number of French authors and composers, such as Charles Baudelaire and Maurice Ravel, and it has been suggested that Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot; may have been deeply influenced by &quot;The Philosophy of Composition&quot;.

The name of the Baltimore Ravens, a professional American football team, was inspired by the poem. Chosen in a fan contest that drew 33,288 voters, the allusion honors Poe, who spent the early part of his career in Baltimore and is buried there.

The mantel of the room in which Poe penned &quot;The Raven&quot; was removed and donated to Columbia University before the demolition of the Brennan Farmhouse. It currently resides at the Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, on the sixth floor of Butler Library.

<text>In Greek mythology, Iobates or Jobates (Ancient Greek: Ἰοβάτης) was a Lycian king, the father of Antea and Philonoe. He was sometimes named Amphianax.

== Mythology ==
Bellerophon was sent into exile to the land of King Iobates. Proetus (king of Argos and Tiryns) wanted Iobates to kill Bellerophon, but Iobates feared the wrath of the gods if he murdered a guest. So he sent Bellerophon on a mission that he deemed impossible: to kill a fire-breathing monster, the Chimera.

An alternate version of the beginning of the quest is that Bellerophon encountered Proetus, who grew intensely jealous of him. Proetus was the son-in-law of Iobates, and sent Bellerophon to him with a sealed message that asked him to kill Bellerophon. Lycia at the time was in the middle of a horrific plague and Iobates didn&#x27;t want to strain the population with a war, which would surely result if he murdered Bellerophon. Instead, he sent him to kill the Chimera.

The goddess Athena, realizing Bellerophon would surely die if he undertook this task alone, sent him aid in the form of the winged horse, Pegasus. Alternatively, Bellerophon sought out the wisest man in Lycia, Polyidus, who told him about the horse. To obtain the services of the winged horse, Polyidus told Bellerophon to sleep in the temple of Athena. While Bellerophon slept, he dreamed of Athena setting a golden bridle down beside him; it was there when he awoke. Bellerophon had to sneak up on Pegasus while it drank from a well (Polyidus told him which well).

Bellerophon mounted his steed and flew off to where the Chimera was said to dwell. When he arrived, the Chimera was truly ferocious, and he could not harm the monster even while riding on Pegasus. He felt the heat of the Chimera&#x27;s breath and was struck with an idea. He got a large block of lead and mounted it on his spear. He then flew head-on towards the Chimera, holding out the spear as far as he could. Before he broke off his attack, he managed to lodge the lead in the creature&#x27;s throat. The beast&#x27;s fire-breath melted the lead, and blocked its air passage. The Chimera suffocated, and Bellerophon returned to King Iobates victorious. Iobates was unable to believe that this valiant hero deserved death, and so he allowed Bellerophon to marry his daughter. Alternatively, Iobates&#x27; daughter, Antea, loved Bellerophon. He scorned her and she committed suicide. Iobates&#x27; other daughter, Philonoe, had an affair with Bellerophon.

<text>In Greek mythology, Polyidus (; ) also known as Polyeidus, is the son of Coeranus, and a famous seer from Argos or Corinth.

==Family==
Polyidus was a descendant of another renowned seer, Melampus, king of Argos. Given that Melampus had two sons, Abas and Mantius, different sources made Coeranus, father of Polyidus, son or grandson of either of the two. Briefly, the two alternate lineages were:

# Melampus– Abas– Coeranus– Polyidus
# Melampus– Mantius– Cleitus– Coeranus– Polyidus

According to a scholiast on Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Polyidus had two sons, Euchenor and Cleitus, by Eurydameia, daughter of Phyleus. Pausanias makes Polyeidus the father of Coeranus, Manto and Astycrateia, and calls Euchenor his grandson through Coeranus.

== Mythology ==
===Glaucus===
The best known myth concerning Polyidus is the one that deals with him saving the life of Glaucus, which runs as follows. One day, Glaucus, son of King Minos and Queen Pasiphaë of Crete, was playing with a mouse and suddenly disappeared. The Kuretes told Minos: &quot;A marvelous creature has been born amongst you: whoever finds the true likeness for this creature will also find the child.&quot;

They interpreted this to refer to a newborn calf in Minos&#x27; herd. Three times a day, the calf changed color from white to red to black. Polyidus ( or Asclepius, god of medicine) observed the similarity to the ripening of the fruit of the mulberry, and Minos sent him to find Glaucus.

Searching for the boy, Polyidus saw an owl driving bees away from a wine-cellar in Minos&#x27; palace. Inside the wine-cellar was a cask of honey, with Glaucus dead inside. Minos demanded Glaucus be brought back to life and ordered Polyidus to be entombed with the body. When a snake appeared nearby, Polyidus killed it immediately. Another snake came for the first, and after seeing its mate dead, the second serpent left and returned with an herb which then brought the first snake back to life. With the herb Polyidus resurrected the child.

Minos refused to let Polyidus leave Crete until he taught Glaucus the art of divination. Polyidus did so, but then, at the last second before leaving to Argos, he asked Glaucus to spit in his mouth. Glaucus did so and forgot everything he had been taught.

The story of Polyidus and Glaucus was the subject of a lost play of Euripides, his &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, and of one by Aeschylus, and Sophocles&#x27; lost &quot;The Mantises&quot;. Previously unknown fragments of Euripedes&#x27; &quot;Polyidus&quot; were found in 2022 and publicized in 2024.

===Other stories===
It is related that Polyidus advised Bellerophon as to how to find and tame Pegasus, in order to kill the Chimera.

Polyidus was said to have come to Megara to purify Alcathous, son of Pelops, for the accidental murder of the latter&#x27;s son Callipolis. He also built the sanctuary of Dionysus Patroos (Paternal), and dedicated a wooden image that in Pausanias&#x27; day was covered up except the face, which alone was exposed. The tomb of his two daughters was shown at Megara.

Polyidus also appears in one of the stories collected in Pseudo-Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;On Rivers&quot;: he explains to Lysippe, mother of Teuthras, the source of her son&#x27;s insanity.

<doc id="78755" wikidata="Q4056376" url="?curid=78755" title="Autonous">
<text>In Greek mythology, Autonous (Ancient Greek: Αὐτόνοος (Auto - Nuss) means &#x27;man with a mind of his own&#x27;) was an owner of a large herd of horses which were pastured by his wife and children.

== Family ==
Autonous was the son of Melaneus and husband of Hippodamia. He was father to Anthus, Erodius, Schoenous, Acanthus and Acanthis.

== Mythology ==
Because Autonous neglected husbandry, the land they lived in produced no crops but only rushes and thistles, that&#x27;s why all the children of Autonous were named after such plants. Erodius, who loved his father&#x27;s horses the most, pastured them on grassy meadows, but one day, Anthus drove them out of their familiar pastures. Out of hunger, the horses attacked Anthus and ate him. Autonous, stricken by panic, could not help his son, and neither could Anthus&#x27; servant, while Hippodamia was trying to drive the horses off but failed due to her physical weakness. Zeus and Apollo, out of pity for the grieving family, transformed the members into birds. Autonous became a stone curlew (Greek όκνος, because he &quot;was not in time&quot;, όκνησε in Greek, to save Anthus), Hippodamia became a lark (the bird has a crest which symbolizes her courage) and Acanthis became a thistle finch; others became birds whose Greek names are the same as their personal names were when they were humans. Erodius and Anthus&#x27; servant were transformed into black and white heron respectively; birds of these two species are never seen together.

<doc id="78757" wikidata="Q415017" url="?curid=78757" title="Academus">
<text>Academus (; ), also Hecademus (), was an Attic hero in Greek mythology. The site of Academus, either a grove or a park, which became known as &quot;Akademeia&quot;, lies on the Cephissus, six stadia from Athens. He is the namesake of the Academy founded by Plato, who taught his students at the site, and as such of the modern English word &quot;academy&quot;, signifying an institution of higher learning.

==Place origins==

Academus, the site, was sacred to Athena, the goddess of wisdom, and other immortals; it had since the Bronze Age sheltered her religious cult, which was perhaps associated with the hero-gods, the Dioskouroi (Castor and Polydeukes), and for the hero Akademos. By classical times the name of the place had evolved into the &quot;Akademeia&quot;. It had also earlier been called &quot;Ecademia&quot; (Ἑκαδημία).

According to Plutarch, Cimon converted this, &quot;waterless and arid spot into a well watered grove, which he provided with clear running-tracks and shady walks&quot;. Its sacred grove furnished the olive oil that was distributed as prizes in the Panathenaic Games and contained in the finely decorated Panathenaic amphorae presented to the winners.

== Mythology ==
Plutarch, in his biography of the Athenian king Theseus (the slayer of the Minotaur), writes that, after being widowed and reaching age 50, the king abducted the 12-year-old child Helen (long before she married Menelaus, met Paris and was the cause of the Trojan War). Due to this outrage, her twin brothers Castor and Pollux invaded Attica to liberate their sister and threatened to destroy Athens. Academus spared the city by telling them where she was hidden, at Aphidnae. Also for this reason Tyndareus (a Spartan king and the father of Castor and step father of Helen) showed Academus much gratitude. As noted by Plutarch: &quot;For this reason he was honored during his life by the Tyndaridae, and often afterwards when the Lacedaemonians invaded Attica and laid waste all the country round about, they spared the Academy, for the sake of Academus.&quot;

==Plato==

Academe was the site of Plato&#x27;s Academy and within its groves, he gave his lectures. According to Diogenes Laertius, Dion, &quot;bought for Plato the little garden which is in the Academy&quot;. Diogenes Laertius, notes Timon of Phlius observes that there Plato &quot;a big fish, but a sweet-voiced speaker, musical in prose as the cicada who, perched on the trees of Hecademus, pours forth a strain as delicate as a lily&quot;.

==Groves of Academe==
The phrase &quot;the groves of Academe&quot; comes from Horace&#x27;s &quot;Epistles,&quot; 20 b.c.): &quot;Atque inter silvas academi quaerere verum&quot; (To seek for truth in the groves of Academe)&#x27;. John Milton, in Paradise Regained book 4, 244-245, uses the phrase: &quot;See there the Olive Grove of Academe, Plato&#x27;s retirement, where the Attic Bird Trills her thick-warbl&#x27;d notes the summer long&quot;. Mary McCarthy made the phrase the title of her satirical novel &quot;The Groves of Academe&quot;.

<doc id="78758" wikidata="Q572133" url="?curid=78758" title="Anteros">
<text>In Greek mythology, Anteros (; ) is the god of requited love (literally &quot;love returned&quot; or &quot;counter-love&quot;) and also the punisher of those who scorn love and the advances of others, or the avenger of unrequited love. He is one of the Erotes.

==Myth==
Anteros was the son of Ares and Aphrodite in Greek mythology, given as a playmate to his brother Eros, who was lonely – the rationale being that love must be answered if it is to prosper. Alternatively, he was said to have arisen from the mutual love between Poseidon and Nerites. Physically, he is depicted as similar to Eros in every way, but with long hair and plumed butterfly wings. He has been described also as armed with either a golden club or arrows of lead.

Anteros, with Eros, was one of a host of winged love gods called Erotes, the ever-youthful winged gods of love, usually depicted as winged boys in the company of Aphrodite or her attendant goddesses. According to Porphyrius, Aphrodite once complained to Themis that Eros remained a perpetual child, so Themis advised her to give him a brother. Aphrodite then gave birth to Anteros, and whenever he was near Eros, Eros grew. But if Anteros was away, Eros shrank back to his previous, smaller size.

An altar to Anteros was put up by the metics in Athens in commemoration of the spurned love of the metic , who was rejected by the Athenian Meles. Upon hearing Timagoras&#x27; declaration of love for him, the young man mockingly ordered him to throw himself down from the top of a tall rock. Seeing Timagoras dead, Meles repented and threw himself down from the same rock.

Describing the nature of the emotion, Plato asserts that it is the result of the great love for another person. The lover, inspired by beauty, is filled with divine love and &quot;filling the soul of the loved one with love in return.&quot; As a result, the loved one falls in love with the lover, though the love is only spoken of as friendship. They experience pain when the two are apart, and relief when they are together, the mirror image of the lover&#x27;s feelings, is anteros, or &quot;counter-love&quot;.

==Legacy==
Anteros is the subject of the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in Piccadilly Circus, London, where he symbolises the selfless philanthropic love of the Earl of Shaftesbury for the poor. The memorial is sometimes given the name The Angel of Christian Charity and is popularly mistaken for Eros.

<text>In Greek mythology, Nycteus (; ) was a king of Thebes. His rule began after the death of Polydorus, and ended when he was succeeded by his brother Lycus.

==Family==
Nycteus and his brother Lycus were the sons of either Chthonius, one of the Spartoi, or of the nymph Clonia and Hyrieus, the son of Poseidon and the Atlantid Alkyone, or of Poseidon and the Pleiad Celaeno. Nycteus had two daughters by Polyxo, Nycteis and Antiope.

==Mythology==
Nycteus and Lycus fled from Euboea after they murdered King Phlegyas, settling in Hyria and then moving to Thebes, because they were friends with Pentheus, its king. Nycteus&#x27;s daughter, Nycteis married Polydorus, who was the successor of Pentheus, and their son was Labdacus. However, Pentheus and Polydorus both died soon after, and Nycteus became regent for Labdacus.

After Antiope was impregnated by Zeus and fled to marry king Epopeus in Sicyon, the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; reports that Nycteus killed himself in shame, after asking Lycus to punish her. Pausanias, however, states that Nycteus led the Thebans against Epopeus, but was wounded and carried back to Thebes, where he died after asking Lycus to continue the battle. Lycus succeeded him as regent of Thebes.

<text>Dirce (; , , modern Greek , meaning &quot;double&quot; or &quot;cleft&quot;) was a queen of Thebes as the wife of Lycus in Greek mythology.

== Family ==
Dirce was a daughter of the river-gods Achelous or Ismenus, or of Helios.

== Mythology ==

After Zeus impregnated Dirce&#x27;s niece Antiope, the latter fled in shame to King Epopeus of Sicyon, but was brought back by Lycus through force, giving birth to the twins Amphion and Zethus on the way. Lycus gave Antiope to Dirce. Dirce hated Antiope and treated her cruelly, until Antiope, in time, escaped.

In Euripides&#x27;s lost play &quot;Antiope&quot;, Antiope flees back to the cave where she gave birth to Amphion and Zethus; they are now living there as young men. They disbelieve her claim to be their mother and refuse her pleas for sanctuary, but when Dirce comes to find Antiope and orders her to be killed, the twins are convinced by the shepherd who raised them that Antiope is their mother. They kill Dirce by tying her to the horns of a bull.

Dirce was devoted to the god Dionysus, who caused a spring to flow where she died, either at Mount Cithaeron or at Thebes, and it was a local tradition for the outgoing Theban hipparch to swear in his successor at her tomb. In Statius&#x27;s &quot;Thebaid&quot;, the spring is a symbol of Thebes, and its name is often used metonymically to refer to the city itself.

==In Roman culture==
The death of Dirce is depicted in a marble statue known as the Farnese Bull, which is now in the collections of the National Archaeological Museum in Naples. The colossal piece, a first-century-AD Roman copy of a second-century-BC Hellenistic Greek original, was first excavated in the 16th century in the Baths of Caracalla. Some scholars identify it with the statue group mentioned in Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, but this is disputed.
This scene was recreated in spectacles in the Roman arena.

<text>In Greek mythology, Melete () was one of the three original Boeotian muses before the Nine Olympian Muses were founded. Her sisters were Aoede and Mneme. She was the muse of thought and meditation. Melete literally means &quot;ponder&quot; and &quot;contemplation&quot; in Greek.

According to Pausanias in the later 2nd century AD, there were three original Muses: Aoidē (&quot;song&quot; or &quot;voice&quot;), Meletē (&quot;practice&quot;), and Mnēmē (&quot;memory&quot;). Together, these three form the complete picture of the preconditions of poetic art in cult practice. In Delphi three Muses were worshipped as well, but with other names: Nētē, Mesē, and Hypatē, which are the names of the three chords of the ancient musical instrument, the lyre. Alternatively they were called Cēphisso, Apollonis, and Borysthenis, whose names characterise them as daughters of Apollo. In later tradition, four Muses were recognized: Thelxinoē, Aoedē, Archē, and Meletē, said to be daughters of Zeus and Plusia (or of Uranus).

<doc id="78768" wikidata="Q11189" url="?curid=78768" title="Proxy server">
<text>In computer networking, a proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource. It improves privacy, security, and possibly performance in the process.

Instead of connecting directly to a server that can fulfill a request for a resource, such as a file or web page, the client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required network transactions. This serves as a method to simplify or control the complexity of the request, or provide additional benefits such as load balancing, privacy, or security. Proxies were devised to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems. A proxy server thus functions on behalf of the client when requesting service, potentially masking the true origin of the request to the resource server.

==Types==
A proxy server may reside on the user&#x27;s local computer, or at any point between the user&#x27;s computer and destination servers on the Internet. A proxy server that passes unmodified requests and responses is usually called a gateway or sometimes a &quot;tunneling proxy&quot;. A forward proxy is an Internet-facing proxy used to retrieve data from a wide range of sources (in most cases, anywhere on the Internet). A reverse proxy is usually an internal-facing proxy used as a front-end to control and protect access to a server on a private network. A reverse proxy commonly also performs tasks such as load-balancing, authentication, decryption, and caching.

===Open proxies===

An open proxy is a forwarding proxy server that is accessible by any Internet user. In 2008, network security expert Gordon Lyon estimated that &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of open proxies are operated on the Internet.

* Anonymous proxy: This server reveals its identity as a proxy server but does not disclose the originating IP address of the client. Although this type of server can be discovered easily, it can be beneficial for some users as it hides the originating IP address.
* &quot;Transparent proxy:&quot; This server not only identifies itself as a proxy server, but with the support of HTTP header fields such as codice_1, the originating IP address can be retrieved as well. The main benefit of using this type of server is its ability to cache a website for faster retrieval.

===Reverse proxies===
A reverse proxy (or surrogate) is a proxy server that appears to clients to be an ordinary server. Reverse proxies forward requests to one or more ordinary servers that handle the request. The response from the original server is returned as if it came directly from the proxy server, leaving the client with no knowledge of the original server. Reverse proxies are installed in the vicinity of one or more web servers. All traffic coming from the Internet and with a destination of one of the neighborhood&#x27;s web servers goes through the proxy server. The use of &quot;reverse&quot; originates in its counterpart &quot;forward proxy&quot; since the reverse proxy sits closer to the web server and serves only a restricted set of websites. There are several reasons for installing reverse proxy servers:
* Encryption/SSL acceleration: when secure websites are created, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption is often not done by the web server itself, but by a reverse proxy that is equipped with SSL acceleration hardware. Furthermore, a host can provide a single &quot;SSL proxy&quot; to provide SSL encryption for an arbitrary number of hosts, removing the need for a separate SSL server certificate for each host, with the downside that all hosts behind the SSL proxy have to share a common DNS name or IP address for SSL connections. This problem can partly be overcome by using the &quot;SubjectAltName&quot; feature of X.509 certificates or the SNI extension of TLS.
* Load balancing: the reverse proxy can distribute the load to several web servers, each serving its own application area. In such a case, the reverse proxy may need to rewrite the URLs in each web page (translation from externally known URLs to the internal locations).
* Serve/cache static content: A reverse proxy can offload the web servers by caching static content like pictures and other static graphical content.
* Compression: the proxy server can optimize and compress the content to speed up the load time.
* Spoon feeding: reduces resource usage caused by slow clients on the web servers by caching the content the web server sent and slowly &quot;spoon feeding&quot; it to the client. This especially benefits dynamically generated pages.
* Security: the proxy server is an additional layer of defense and can protect against some OS and web-server-specific attacks. However, it does not provide any protection from attacks against the web application or service itself, which is generally considered the larger threat.
* Extranet publishing: a reverse proxy server facing the Internet can be used to communicate to a firewall server internal to an organization, providing extranet access to some functions while keeping the servers behind the firewalls. If used in this way, security measures should be considered to protect the rest of your infrastructure in case this server is compromised, as its web application is exposed to attack from the Internet.

====Forward proxy vs. reverse proxy ====
A forward proxy is a server that routes traffic between clients and another system, which is in most occasions external to the network. This means it can regulate traffic according to preset policies, convert and mask client IP addresses, enforce security protocols and block unknown traffic. A forward proxy enhances security and policy enforcement within an internal network. A reverse proxy, instead of protecting the client, is used to protect the servers. A reverse proxy accepts a request from a client, forwards that request to another one of many other servers, and then returns the results from the server that specifically processed the request to the client. Effectively a reverse proxy acts as a gateway between clients, users and application servers and handles all the traffic routing whilst also protecting the identity of the server that physically processes the request.

==Uses==
===Monitoring and filtering===
====Content-control software====

A content-filtering web proxy server provides administrative control over the content that may be relayed in one or both directions through the proxy. It is commonly used in both commercial and non-commercial organizations (especially schools) to ensure that Internet usage conforms to acceptable use policy.

Content filtering proxy servers will often support user authentication to control web access. It also usually produces logs, either to give detailed information about the URLs accessed by specific users or to monitor bandwidth usage statistics. It may also communicate to daemon-based or ICAP-based antivirus software to provide security against viruses and other malware by scanning incoming content in real-time before it enters the network.

Many workplaces, schools, and colleges restrict web sites and online services that are accessible and available in their buildings. Governments also censor undesirable content. This is done either with a specialized proxy, called a content filter (both commercial and free products are available), or by using a cache-extension protocol such as ICAP, that allows plug-in extensions to an open caching architecture.

Websites commonly used by students to circumvent filters and access blocked content often include a proxy, from which the user can then access the websites that the filter is trying to block.

Requests may be filtered by several methods, such as a URL or DNS blacklists, URL regex filtering, MIME filtering, or content keyword filtering. Blacklists are often provided and maintained by web-filtering companies, often grouped into categories (pornography, gambling, shopping, social networks, etc.).

The proxy then fetches the content, assuming the requested URL is acceptable. At this point, a dynamic filter may be applied on the return path. For example, JPEG files could be blocked based on fleshtone matches, or language filters could dynamically detect unwanted language. If the content is rejected then an HTTP fetch error may be returned to the requester.

Most web filtering companies use an internet-wide crawling robot that assesses the likelihood that content is a certain type. Manual labor is used to correct the resultant database based on complaints or known flaws in the content-matching algorithms.

Some proxies scan outbound content, e.g., for data loss prevention; or scan content for malicious software.

====Filtering of encrypted data====
Web filtering proxies are not able to peer inside secure sockets HTTP transactions, assuming the chain-of-trust of SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) has not been tampered with. The SSL/TLS chain-of-trust relies on trusted root certificate authorities.

In a workplace setting where the client is managed by the organization, devices may be configured to trust a root certificate whose private key is known to the proxy. In such situations, proxy analysis of the contents of an SSL/TLS transaction becomes possible. The proxy is effectively operating a man-in-the-middle attack, allowed by the client&#x27;s trust of a root certificate the proxy owns.

====Bypassing filters and censorship====
If the destination server filters content based on the origin of the request, the use of a proxy can circumvent this filter. For example, a server using IP-based geolocation to restrict its service to a certain country can be accessed using a proxy located in that country to access the service.

Web proxies are the most common means of bypassing government censorship, although no more than 3% of Internet users use any circumvention tools.

Some proxy service providers allow businesses access to their proxy network for rerouting traffic for business intelligence purposes.

In some cases, users can circumvent proxies that filter using blacklists by using services designed to proxy information from a non-blacklisted location.

====Logging and eavesdropping====
Proxies can be installed in order to eavesdrop upon the data-flow between client machines and the web. All content sent or accessed – including passwords submitted and cookies used – can be captured and analyzed by the proxy operator. For this reason, passwords to online services (such as webmail and banking) should always be exchanged over a cryptographically secured connection, such as SSL.

By chaining the proxies which do not reveal data about the original requester, it is possible to obfuscate activities from the eyes of the user&#x27;s destination. However, more traces will be left on the intermediate hops, which could be used or offered up to trace the user&#x27;s activities. If the policies and administrators of these other proxies are unknown, the user may fall victim to a false sense of security just because those details are out of sight and mind.
In what is more of an inconvenience than a risk, proxy users may find themselves being blocked from certain Web sites, as numerous forums and Web sites block IP addresses from proxies known to have spammed or trolled the site. Proxy bouncing can be used to maintain privacy.

===Improving performance===
A caching proxy server accelerates service requests by retrieving the content saved from a previous request made by the same client or even other clients. Caching proxies keep local copies of frequently requested resources, allowing large organizations to significantly reduce their upstream bandwidth usage and costs, while significantly increasing performance. Most ISPs and large businesses have a caching proxy. Caching proxies were the first kind of proxy server. Web proxies are commonly used to cache web pages from a web server. Poorly implemented caching proxies can cause problems, such as an inability to use user authentication.

A proxy that is designed to mitigate specific link related issues or degradation is a Performance Enhancing Proxy (PEPs). These are typically used to improve TCP performance in the presence of high round-trip times or high packet loss (such as wireless or mobile phone networks); or highly asymmetric links featuring very different upload and download rates. PEPs can make more efficient use of the network, for example, by merging TCP ACKs (acknowledgements) or compressing data sent at the application layer.

===Translation===
A translation proxy is a proxy server that is used to localize a website experience for different markets. Traffic from the global audience is routed through the translation proxy to the source website. As visitors browse the proxied site, requests go back to the source site where pages are rendered. The original language content in the response is replaced by the translated content as it passes back through the proxy. The translations used in a translation proxy can be either machine translation, human translation, or a combination of machine and human translation. Different translation proxy implementations have different capabilities. Some allow further customization of the source site for the local audiences such as excluding the source content or substituting the source content with the original local content.

===Accessing services anonymously===

An anonymous proxy server (sometimes called a web proxy) generally attempts to anonymize web surfing. Anonymizers may be differentiated into several varieties. The destination server (the server that ultimately satisfies the web request) receives requests from the anonymizing proxy server and thus does not receive information about the end user&#x27;s address. The requests are not anonymous to the anonymizing proxy server, however, and so a degree of trust is present between the proxy server and the user. Many proxy servers are funded through a continued advertising link to the user.

Access control: Some proxy servers implement a logon requirement. In large organizations, authorized users must log on to gain access to the web. The organization can thereby track usage to individuals. Some anonymizing proxy servers may forward data packets with header lines such as HTTP_VIA, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, or HTTP_FORWARDED, which may reveal the IP address of the client. Other anonymizing proxy servers, known as elite or high-anonymity proxies, make it appear that the proxy server is the client. A website could still suspect a proxy is being used if the client sends packets that include a cookie from a previous visit that did not use the high-anonymity proxy server. Clearing cookies, and possibly the cache, would solve this problem.

====QA geotargeted advertising====
Advertisers use proxy servers for validating, checking and quality assurance of geotargeted ads. A geotargeting ad server checks the request source IP address and uses a geo-IP database to determine the geographic source of requests. Using a proxy server that is physically located inside a specific country or a city gives advertisers the ability to test geotargeted ads.

===Security===
A proxy can keep the internal network structure of a company secret by using network address translation, which can help the security of the internal network. This makes requests from machines and users on the local network anonymous. Proxies can also be combined with firewalls.

An incorrectly configured proxy can provide access to a network otherwise isolated from the Internet.

====Cross-domain resources====
Proxies allow web sites to make web requests to externally hosted resources (e.g. images, music files, etc.) when cross-domain restrictions prohibit the web site from linking directly to the outside domains. Proxies also allow the browser to make web requests to externally hosted content on behalf of a website when cross-domain restrictions (in place to protect websites from the likes of data theft) prohibit the browser from directly accessing the outside domains.

===Malicious usages===
====Secondary market brokers====
Secondary market brokers use web proxy servers to circumvent restrictions on online purchases of limited products such as limited sneakers or tickets.

==Implementations of proxies==

===Web proxy servers===
Web proxies forward HTTP requests. The request from the client is the same as a regular HTTP request except the full URL is passed, instead of just the path.
GET https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server HTTP/1.1
Proxy-Authorization: Basic encoded-credentials
Accept: text/html

This request is sent to the proxy server, the proxy makes the request specified and returns the response.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset UTF-8

Some web proxies allow the HTTP CONNECT method to set up forwarding of arbitrary data through the connection; a common policy is to only forward port 443 to allow HTTPS traffic.

Examples of web proxy servers include Apache (with mod_proxy or Traffic Server), HAProxy, IIS configured as proxy (e.g., with Application Request Routing), Nginx, Privoxy, Squid, Varnish (reverse proxy only), WinGate, Ziproxy, Tinyproxy, RabbIT and Polipo.

For clients, the problem of complex or multiple proxy-servers is solved by a client-server Proxy auto-config protocol (&quot;PAC file&quot;).

===SOCKS proxy===
SOCKS also forwards arbitrary data after a connection phase, and is similar to HTTP CONNECT in web proxies.

===Transparent proxy===

Also known as an intercepting proxy, inline proxy, or forced proxy, a transparent proxy intercepts normal application layer communication without requiring any special client configuration. Clients need not be aware of the existence of the proxy. A transparent proxy is normally located between the client and the Internet, with the proxy performing some of the functions of a gateway or router.

 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol—HTTP/1.1) offers standard definitions:

&quot;A &#x27;transparent proxy&#x27; is a proxy that does not modify the request or response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and identification&quot;. &quot;A &#x27;non-transparent proxy&#x27; is a proxy that modifies the request or response in order to provide some added service to the user agent, such as group annotation services, media type transformation, protocol reduction, or anonymity filtering&quot;.

TCP Intercept is a traffic filtering security feature that protects TCP servers from TCP SYN flood attacks, which are a type of denial-of-service attack. TCP Intercept is available for IP traffic only.

In 2009 a security flaw in the way that transparent proxies operate was published by Robert Auger, and the Computer Emergency Response Team issued an advisory listing dozens of affected transparent and intercepting proxy servers.

====Purpose====
Intercepting proxies are commonly used in businesses to enforce acceptable use policies and to ease administrative overheads since no client browser configuration is required. This second reason, however is mitigated by features such as Active Directory group policy, or DHCP and automatic proxy detection.

Intercepting proxies are also commonly used by ISPs in some countries to save upstream bandwidth and improve customer response times by caching. This is more common in countries where bandwidth is more limited (e.g. island nations) or must be paid for.

====Issues====
The diversion or interception of a TCP connection creates several issues. First, the original destination IP and port must somehow be communicated to the proxy. This is not always possible (e.g., where the gateway and proxy reside on different hosts). There is a class of cross-site attacks that depend on certain behaviors of intercepting proxies that do not check or have access to information about the original (intercepted) destination. This problem may be resolved by using an integrated packet-level and application level appliance or software which is then able to communicate this information between the packet handler and the proxy.

Intercepting also creates problems for HTTP authentication, especially connection-oriented authentication such as NTLM, as the client browser believes it is talking to a server rather than a proxy. This can cause problems where an intercepting proxy requires authentication, and then the user connects to a site that also requires authentication.

Finally, intercepting connections can cause problems for HTTP caches, as some requests and responses become uncacheable by a shared cache.

====Implementation methods====
In integrated firewall/proxy servers where the router/firewall is on the same host as the proxy, communicating original destination information can be done by any method, for example Microsoft TMG or WinGate.

Interception can also be performed using Cisco&#x27;s WCCP (Web Cache Control Protocol). This proprietary protocol resides on the router and is configured from the cache, allowing the cache to determine what ports and traffic is sent to it via transparent redirection from the router. This redirection can occur in one of two ways: GRE tunneling (OSI Layer 3) or MAC rewrites (OSI Layer 2).

Once traffic reaches the proxy machine itself, interception is commonly performed with NAT (Network Address Translation). Such setups are invisible to the client browser, but leave the proxy visible to the web server and other devices on the internet side of the proxy. Recent Linux and some BSD releases provide TPROXY (transparent proxy) which performs IP-level (OSI Layer 3) transparent interception and spoofing of outbound traffic, hiding the proxy IP address from other network devices.

====Detection====
Several methods may be used to detect the presence of an intercepting proxy server:

* By comparing the client&#x27;s external IP address to the address seen by an external web server, or sometimes by examining the HTTP headers received by a server. A number of sites have been created to address this issue, by reporting the user&#x27;s IP address as seen by the site back to the user on a web page. Google also returns the IP address as seen by the page if the user searches for &quot;IP&quot;.
* By comparing the results of online IP checkers when accessed using HTTPS vs. HTTP, as most intercepting proxies do not intercept SSL. If there is suspicion of SSL being intercepted, one can examine the certificate associated with any secure web site, the root certificate should indicate whether it was issued for the purpose of intercepting.
* By comparing the sequence of network hops reported by a tool such as traceroute for a proxied protocol such as HTTP (port 80) with that for a non-proxied protocol such as SMTP (port 25).
* By attempting to make a connection to an IP address at which there is known to be no server. The proxy will accept the connection and then attempt to proxy it on. When the proxy finds no server to accept the connection, it may return an error message or simply close the connection to the client. This difference in behavior is simple to detect. For example, most web browsers will generate a browser created error page in the case where they cannot connect to an HTTP server but will return a different error in the case where the connection is accepted and then closed.
* By serving the end-user specially programmed Adobe Flash SWF applications or Sun Java applets that send HTTP calls back to their server.

===CGI proxy===
A CGI web proxy accepts target URLs using a Web form in the user&#x27;s browser window, processes the request, and returns the results to the user&#x27;s browser. Consequently, it can be used on a device or network that does not allow &quot;true&quot; proxy settings to be changed. The first recorded CGI proxy, named &quot;rover&quot; at the time but renamed in 1998 to &quot;CGIProxy&quot;, was developed by American computer scientist James Marshall in early 1996 for an article in &quot;Unix Review&quot; by Rich Morin.

The majority of CGI proxies are powered by one of CGIProxy (written in the Perl language), Glype (written in the PHP language), or PHProxy (written in the PHP language). As of April 2016, CGIProxy has received about two million downloads, Glype has received almost a million downloads, whilst PHProxy still receives hundreds of downloads per week. Despite waning in popularity due to VPNs and other privacy methods, there are still a few hundred CGI proxies online.

Some CGI proxies were set up for purposes such as making websites more accessible to disabled people, but have since been shut down due to excessive traffic, usually caused by a third party advertising the service as a means to bypass local filtering. Since many of these users do not care about the collateral damage they are causing, it became necessary for organizations to hide their proxies, disclosing the URLs only to those who take the trouble to contact the organization and demonstrate a genuine need.

===Suffix proxy===
A suffix proxy allows a user to access web content by appending the name of the proxy server to the URL of the requested content (e.g. &quot;en.wikipedia.org.&quot;SuffixProxy.com&quot;&quot;). Suffix proxy servers are easier to use than regular proxy servers, but they do not offer high levels of anonymity, and their primary use is for bypassing web filters. However, this is rarely used due to more advanced web filters.

===Tor onion proxy software===
Tor is a system intended to provide online anonymity. Tor client software routes Internet traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of servers for concealing a user&#x27;s computer location or usage from someone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes tracing Internet activity more difficult, and is intended to protect users&#x27; personal freedom and their online privacy.

&quot;Onion routing&quot; refers to the layered nature of the encryption service: The original data are encrypted and re-encrypted multiple times, then sent through successive Tor relays, each one of which decrypts a &quot;layer&quot; of encryption before passing the data on to the next relay and ultimately the destination. This reduces the possibility of the original data being unscrambled or understood in transit.

===I2P anonymous proxy===
The I2P anonymous network (&#x27;I2P&#x27;) is a proxy network aiming at online anonymity. It implements garlic routing, which is an enhancement of Tor&#x27;s onion routing. I2P is fully distributed and works by encrypting all communications in various layers and relaying them through a network of routers run by volunteers in various locations. By keeping the source of the information hidden, I2P offers censorship resistance. The goals of I2P are to protect users&#x27; personal freedom, privacy, and ability to conduct confidential business.

Each user of I2P runs an I2P router on their computer (node). The I2P router takes care of finding other peers and building anonymizing tunnels through them. I2P provides proxies for all protocols (HTTP, IRC, SOCKS, ...).

===Comparison to network address translators===
The proxy concept refers to a layer-7 application in the OSI reference model. Network address translation (NAT) is similar to a proxy but operates in layer 3.

In the client configuration of layer-3 NAT, configuring the gateway is sufficient. However, for the client configuration of a layer-7 proxy, the destination of the packets that the client generates must always be the proxy server (layer 7), then the proxy server reads each packet and finds out the true destination.

Because NAT operates at layer 3, it is less resource-intensive than the layer-7 proxy, but also less flexible. As we compare these two technologies, we might encounter a terminology known as &#x27;transparent firewall&#x27;. Transparent firewall means that the proxy uses the layer-7 proxy advantages without the knowledge of the client. The client presumes that the gateway is a NAT in layer 3, and it does not have any idea about the inside of the packet, but through this method, the layer-3 packets are sent to the layer-7 proxy for investigation.

===DNS proxy===
A DNS proxy server takes DNS queries from a (usually local) network and forwards them to an Internet Domain Name Server. It may also cache DNS records.

===Proxifiers===
Some client programs &quot;SOCKS-ify&quot; requests, which allows adaptation of any networked software to connect to external networks via certain types of proxy servers (mostly SOCKS).

===Residential proxy (RESIP)===
A residential proxy is an intermediary that uses a real IP address provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) with physical devices such as mobiles and computers of end-users. Instead of connecting directly to a server, residential proxy users connect to the target through residential IP addresses. The target then identifies them as organic internet users. It does not let any tracking tool identify the reallocation of the user. Any residential proxy can send any number of concurrent requests, and IP addresses are directly related to a specific region. Unlike regular residential proxies, which hide the user&#x27;s real IP address behind another IP address, rotating residential proxies, also known as &quot;backconnect proxies&quot;, conceal the user&#x27;s real IP address behind a pool of proxies. These proxies switch between themselves at every session or at regular intervals.

Despite the providers assertion that the proxy hosts are voluntarily participating, numerous proxies are operated on potentially compromised hosts, including Internet of things devices. Through the process of cross-referencing the hosts, researchers have identified and analyzed logs that have been classified as potentially unwanted program and exposed a range of unauthorized activities conducted by RESIP hosts. These activities encompassed illegal promotion, fast fluxing, phishing, hosting malware, and more.

<doc id="78772" wikidata="Q104413" url="?curid=78772" title="Erato">
<text>In Greek mythology, Erato (; ) is one of the Greek Muses, the inspirational goddesses of literature, science, and the arts. The name would mean &quot;desired&quot; or &quot;lovely&quot;, if derived from the same root as Eros, as Apollonius of Rhodes playfully suggested in the invocation to Erato that begins Book III of his &quot;Argonautica&quot;.

== Function ==
Erato is the Muse of lyric poetry, particularly erotic poetry, and mimic imitation. In the Orphic hymn to the Muses, it is Erato who charms the sight. Since the Renaissance she has mostly been shown with a wreath of myrtle and roses, holding a lyre, or a small kithara, a musical instrument often associated with Apollo. In Simon Vouet&#x27;s representations, two turtle-doves are eating seeds at her feet. She is sometimes depicted holding a golden arrow, symbolizing &quot;eros&quot;, the feeling she inspires in everybody; at times she is accompanied by Eros, holding a torch.

== Family ==
In Hesiod&#x27;s genealogy, Erato is the daughter of Zeus and the Titaness Mnemosyne, and the sister to Calliope, Clio, Euterpe, Melpomene, Polyhymnia, Terpsichore, Thalia and Urania.

Her father gave Erato to Malus (eponym of Malea), as a bride and by him became the mother of Cleophema who bore Aegle (Coronis) by Phlegyas.

== Development ==

Erato was named with the other muses in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;. She was also invoked at the beginning of a lost poem, &quot;Rhadine&quot; (), that was referred to and briefly quoted by Strabo. The love story of Rhadine made her supposed tomb on the island of Samos a pilgrimage site for star-crossed lovers in the time of Pausanias and Erato was linked again with love in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedrus&quot;; nevertheless, even in the third century BC, when Apollonius wrote, the Muses were not yet as inextricably linked to specific types of poetry as they became.

Erato is also invoked at the start of book 7 of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, which marks the beginning of the second half or &quot;Iliadic&quot; section of the poem.

<doc id="78773" wikidata="Q103992" url="?curid=78773" title="Melpomene">
<text>Melpomene (; ) is the Muse of tragedy in Greek mythology. She is described as the daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne (and therefore of power and memory) along with the other Muses, and she is often portrayed with a tragic theatrical mask.

== Etymology ==
Melpomene&#x27;s name (implying the meaning &quot;Songstress&quot;)
is derived by etymologists from the Ancient Greek verb (&quot;melpô&quot;) or from its inflexion μέλπομαι (&quot;melpomai&quot;) meaning &quot;to celebrate with dance and song&quot;.
The Oxford English Dictionary cites μέλπειν (&quot;melpein&quot; – to sing).

== Myth ==
Melpomene is one of the nine Muses, the Muse of tragedy. Hesiod, Apollodorus, and Diodorus Siculus all held that Melpomene was the daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne. She was the sister of the other Muses, Calliope, Clio, Erato, Euterpe, Polyhymnia, Terpsichore, Thalia, and Urania. Apollodorus, Lycophron, and Gaius Julius Hyginus said that Melpomene was the mother of the sirens, though some ancient writers identified this role with other figures.

Melpomene is described as singing songs of mourning for people of note after they die, particularly for poets.

== Iconography and depiction ==

Depictions of Melpomene may include a tragic mask, buskins, lyres, scrolls, and a crown of leaves. She may also be shown with a dagger and a cup. Satirist Anthony Pasquin described Melpomene as &quot;murder-loving&quot;.

The iconographer Cesare Ripa described Melpomene in his &quot;Iconologia&quot;. An English edition describes her as &quot;a gentlewoman all in mourning; she holds a bloody dagger in her right hand; behind her, upon the ground, a garment of cloth of gold, and diverse precious jewels; shod with &quot;cothurni&quot;&quot;. Another describes her as being &quot;of a grave aspect, in a heroic dress, with her head finely attired; she holds a cup in one hand, and a dagger in the other, with a crown and scepter at her feet; she is shod in buskins, which were used by the ancient tragedians. The grave aspect and heroic dress, denote that tragedy is a representation of famous deeds and of history&quot;.

== Invocation and use ==

=== Literature ===
In Greek and Latin poetry since Horace (d. 8 BC), it was commonly auspicious to invoke Melpomene. Horace invokes Melpomene in Ode 3.30, when he describes his poetry as a monument as great as any king&#x27;s tomb. The poet asks Melpomene to crown him with a laurel wreath and make him a poet laureate.

=== Visual art ===
The oldest surviving portrait of Virgil, a mosaic dated to the first century, features Virgil between Melpomene and Clio, the muse of history. Theologian Louis A. Ruprecht interpreted this as a commentary on the similarities of recording history and writing fictional works of tragedy.

The 2018 excavation of a Roman bathhouse in Decapolis uncovered six mostly preserved statues of the Muses. The statue of Melpomene was 62 centimeters tall and made of Pentelic marble. Its head was lost, but it was identifiable by the drama mask lying on its thigh.

The tragic actress Sarah Siddons posed for several paintings depicted as Melpomene in the 1780s and 1790s. The 1784 Joshua Reynolds painting &quot;Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse&quot; is recognized as a high point in the careers of both Siddons and Reynolds.

=== Science ===
The minor planet 18 Melpomene was named after the muse by the British Astronomer Royal in 1852, George Biddell Airy. He chose a name representing tragedy because his daughter, Elizabeth, had died on the day it was discovered, which was also the thirteenth anniversary of an earlier son&#x27;s death.

<text>Polyhymnia (; ), alternatively Polymnia (Πολύμνια), is, in Greek mythology, the Muse of sacred poetry, sacred hymn, dance and eloquence, as well as agriculture and pantomime.
== Etymology ==
Polyhymnia name comes from the Greek words &quot;poly&quot;, meaning &quot;many&quot;, and &quot;hymnos&quot;, which means &quot;praise&quot;.

== Appearance ==
Polyhymnia is depicted as serious, pensive and meditative, and often holding a finger to her mouth, dressed in a long cloak and veil and resting her elbow on a pillar. Polyhymnia is also sometimes credited as being the Muse of geometry and meditation.

In &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;, Diodorus Siculus wrote, &quot;Polyhymnia, because by her great (polle) praises (humnesis) she brings distinction to writers whose works have won for them immortal fame...&quot;.

== Family ==
As one of the Muses, Polyhymnia is the daughter of Zeus and the Titaness Mnemosyne. She was also described as the mother of Triptolemus by Cheimarrhoos, son of Ares, and of the musician Orpheus by Apollo.

== Dedications ==
On Mount Parnassus, there was a spring sacred to the Muses. It was said to flow between two big rocks above Delphi, then down into a large square basin. The water was used by the Pythia, who were priests and priestesses, for oracular purposes including divination.

== In popular culture ==

* In astronomy, there are ten asteroids named after the Muses, and moons named after another two. The one named after Polyhymnia is a main belt asteroid discovered by Jean Chacornac, a French astronomer, in 1854.
* Polyhymnia appears in Dante&#x27;s Divine Comedy: Paradiso. Canto XXIII, line 56, and is referenced in modern works of fiction.

<text>In Greek mythology, Terpsichore (; , &quot;delight in dancing&quot;) is one of the nine Muses and goddess of dance and chorus. She lends her name to the word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;of or relating to dance&quot;.

== Appearance ==
Terpsichore is usually depicted sitting down, holding a lyre, accompanying the dancers&#x27; choirs with her music. Her name comes from the Greek words τέρπω (&quot;delight&quot;) and χoρός (&quot;dance&quot;).

== Family ==
According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Zeus lay with the Titan Mnemosyne each night for nine nights in Piera, producing the nine Muses.

According to Apollonius of Rhodes, Terpsichore was the mother of the Sirens by the river god Achelous. The &quot;Etymologicum Magnum&quot; mentions her as the mother of the Thracian king Biston by Ares. According to the Byzantine scholar Eustathius, Terpsichore was the mother of the Thracian king Rhesus by the river god Strymon.

==In culture==
===Historical===
* The British 32-gun frigate commanded by Captain Bowen participated in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797).

===Literature===
* When &quot;The Histories&quot; of Herodotus were divided by later editors into nine books, each book was named after a Muse. Terpsichore was the name of the fifth book.

===Music and dance===
* &quot;Terpsichore&quot; (1612) is the title of a large collection of dance tunes collected by Michael Praetorius, some originating with Pierre-Francisque Caroubel and some later adapted for wind ensemble by Bob Margolis.
* Terpsichore is also found in François Couperin&#x27;s &quot;Second Ordre&quot; from the &quot;Pièces de clavecin.&quot;
* The third version (HWV 8c) of Handel&#x27;s opera &quot;Il pastor fido&quot; (1712) includes a new prologue written in 1734 titled &quot;Terpsicore.&quot;
* The eighteenth century French dancer and courtesan Marie-Madeleine Guimard named the private theater in her private palace (1766) the Temple of Terpsichore.

<text>Urania ( ; ; modern Greek shortened name &quot;Ránia&quot;; meaning &quot;heavenly&quot; or &quot;of heaven&quot;) was, in Greek mythology, the muse of astronomy and astrology. Urania is the goddess of astronomy and stars, her attributes being the globe and compass.

The muse &quot;Urania&quot; is sometimes confused with &quot;Aphrodite Urania&quot; (&quot;heavenly Aphrodite&quot;) because of their similar name.

== Family ==
Urania was the daughter of Zeus by Mnemosyne and also a great-granddaughter of Uranus. Some accounts list her as the mother of the musician Linus by Apollo or Hermes or Amphimarus, son of Poseidon. Hymenaeus is also said to have been a son of Urania.

== Function and representation ==
Urania is often associated with Universal Love. Sometimes identified as the eldest of the divine sisters, Urania inherited Zeus&#x27; majesty and power and the beauty and grace of her mother Mnemosyne.

Urania dresses in a cloak embroidered with stars and keeps her eyes and attention focused on the Heavens. She is usually represented with a celestial globe to which she points with a little staff, and depicted in modern art with stars above her head. She is able to foretell the future by the arrangement of the stars.

== Urania as Muse ==

Those who are most concerned with philosophy and the heavens are dearest to her. Those who have been instructed by her she raises aloft to heaven, for it is a fact that imagination and the power of thought lift men&#x27;s souls to heavenly heights.&quot;Urania, o&#x27;er her star-bespangled lyre,&quot;&quot;With touch of majesty diffused her soul;&quot;&quot;A thousand tones, that in the breast inspire,&quot;&quot;Exalted feelings, o er the wires&#x27;gan roll—&quot;&quot;How at the call of Jove the mist unfurled,&quot;&quot;And o&#x27;er the swelling vault—the glowing sky,&quot;&quot;The new-born stars hung out their lamps on high,&quot;&quot;And rolled their mighty orbs to music&#x27;s sweetest sound.&quot;—From &quot;An Ode To Music&quot; by James G. PercivalDuring the Renaissance, Urania began to be considered the Muse for Christian poets. In the invocation to Book 7 of John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, the poet invokes Urania to aid his narration of the creation of the cosmos, though he cautions that it is &quot;[t]he meaning, not the name I call&quot; (7.5)

== In popular culture ==

<doc id="78777" wikidata="Q108019" url="?curid=78777" title="Thalia (Muse)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Thalia ( or ; ; &quot;the joyous, the flourishing&quot;, from , &quot;thállein&quot;; &quot;to flourish, to be verdant&quot;), also spelled Thaleia, was one of the Muses, the goddess who presided over comedy and idyllic poetry. In this context her name means &quot;flourishing&quot;, because the praises in her songs flourish through time.

== Appearance ==
Thalia was portrayed as a young woman with a joyous air, crowned with ivy, wearing boots and holding a comic mask in her hand. Many of her statues also hold a bugle and a trumpet, or occasionally a shepherd&#x27;s staff or a wreath of ivy.

== Family ==
Thalia was the daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne, the eighth-born of the nine Muses. According to Apollodorus, she and Apollo were the parents of the Corybantes.

<doc id="78781" wikidata="Q119798" url="?curid=78781" title="Michael Douglas">
<text>Michael Kirk Douglas (born September 25, 1944) is an American actor and film producer. He has received numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, the Cecil B. DeMille Award, and the AFI Life Achievement Award.

The elder son of Kirk Douglas and Diana Dill, Douglas earned his Bachelor of Arts in drama from the University of California, Santa Barbara. He produced &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975), having acquired the rights to the novel from his father and later earned the Academy Award for Best Picture as a producer. Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987), a role which he reprised in the sequel &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot; (2010). Other notable roles include in &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; (1979), &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; (1984), &quot;The Jewel of the Nile&quot; (1985), &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (1987), &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; (1989), &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992), &quot;Falling Down&quot; (1993), &quot;The American President&quot; (1995), &quot;The Game&quot; (1997), &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000), &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; (2000), and &quot;Solitary Man&quot; (2009).

On television, he started his career earning three consecutive Emmy Award nominations for playing a homicide inspector in the ABC police procedural series &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; (1972-1976). He won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for portraying Liberace in the HBO film &quot;Behind the Candelabra&quot; (2013), and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy for playing an aging acting coach in the Netflix comedy series &quot;The Kominsky Method&quot; (2018–2021). He played Benjamin Franklin in the Apple TV+ miniseries &quot;Franklin&quot; (2024). He portrayed Hank Pym in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with &quot;Ant-Man&quot; (2015).

Douglas has received notice for his humanitarian and political activism. He sits on the board of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, is an honorary board member of the anti-war grant-making foundation Ploughshares Fund and he was appointed as a United Nations Messenger of Peace in 1998. He has been married to actress Catherine Zeta-Jones since 2000.

==Early life and education==
Douglas was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the first child of actors Kirk Douglas (1916–2020) and Diana Dill (1923–2015). His parents met at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

His father was Jewish and was born &quot;Issur Danielovitch&quot;. Michael&#x27;s paternal grandparents were emigrants from Chavusy in the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus). His mother was from Devonshire Parish, Bermuda, and had English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, French, Belgian, and Dutch ancestry. Douglas&#x27; uncle was politician Sir Nicholas Bayard Dill, and Douglas&#x27; maternal grandfather, Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Melville Dill, served as Attorney General of Bermuda, as a Member of the Parliament of Bermuda (MCP), and as commanding officer of the Bermuda Militia Artillery. Douglas is a US citizen by birth in the United States and has Bermudian Status from his mother&#x27;s birth in Bermuda. 

His great-grandfather, Thomas Newbold Dill (1837–1910), was a merchant, an MCP for Devonshire Parish from 1868 to 1888, a member of the legislative council and an assistant justice from 1888, mayor of the City of Hamilton from 1891 to 1897, served on numerous committees and boards, and was a member of the Devonshire Church (Church of England) and Devonshire Parish vestries. Thomas Newbold Dill&#x27;s father, another Thomas Melville Dill, was a sea captain who took the Bermudian-built barque &quot;Sir George F. Seymour&quot; from Bermuda to Ireland in thirteen days in March 1858, but lost his master&#x27;s certificate after the wreck of the Bermudian-built &quot;Cedrine&quot; on the Isle of Wight while returning the last convict laborers from the Royal Naval Dockyard in Bermuda to Britain in 1863. The current (installed on 29 May 2013) Bishop of Bermuda, the Right Reverend Nicholas Dill, is a cousin of Michael Douglas.

Douglas has a younger brother, Joel Douglas (born 1947), and two paternal half-brothers, Peter Douglas (born 1955) and Eric Douglas (1958–2004), from stepmother Anne Buydens.

Douglas attended The Allen-Stevenson School in New York City, Eaglebrook School in Deerfield, Massachusetts, and The Choate Preparatory School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut. He received his B.A. in dramatic art from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1968, where he was also the honorary president of the UCSB Alumni Association. He studied acting with Wynn Handman at The American Place Theatre in New York City.

==Career==
===1969–1979: Early years===

His first TV breakthrough role came with a 1969 &quot;CBS Playhouse&quot; special, &quot;The Experiment&quot;—and it was the only time he was billed as &quot;M.K. Douglas&quot;. On November 24, 1969, Douglas formed his first independent film production company, Bigstick Productions, Limited. Michael Douglas started his film career in the late 1960s and early 1970s, appearing in little known films such as &quot;Hail, Hero!&quot;, &quot;Adam at 6 A.M.&quot;, and &quot;Summertree&quot;. His performance in &quot;Hail, Hero!&quot; earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Male Newcomer.

His first significant role came in the TV series &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; from 1972 to 1976, in which he starred alongside Karl Malden. Douglas later said that Malden became a &quot;mentor&quot; and someone he &quot;admired and loved deeply&quot;. After Douglas left the show, he had a long association with his mentor until Malden&#x27;s death on July 1, 2009. In 2004, Douglas presented Malden with the Monte Cristo Award of the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut for the Lifetime Achievement Award.

In late 1971, Douglas received from his father, Kirk Douglas, the rights to the novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, which had been purchased by Bryna Productions in February 1962. Michael went on to produce the film of the same name with Saul Zaentz. Kirk Douglas hoped to portray McMurphy himself, having starred in an earlier stage version, but the director, Milos Forman, went with Jack Nicholson, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Douglas won the Award for Best Picture for producing the film. In December 1976, Michael and his brother Peter became head of their father&#x27;s film production company, The Bryna Company, though Michael would depart by 1978 to focus exclusively on producing through his own Bigstick Productions.

After leaving &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; in 1976, Douglas played a hospital doctor in the medical thriller &quot;Coma&quot; (1978), and in 1979 he played the role of a troubled marathon runner in &quot;Running&quot;. In 1979, he both produced and starred in &quot;The China Syndrome&quot;, a dramatic film co-starring Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon about a nuclear power plant accident (the Three Mile Island accident took place 12 days after the film&#x27;s release). The film was considered &quot;one of the most intelligent Hollywood films of the 1970s&quot;. In June 1979, Michael appointed Jack Brodsky Executive Vice-president of Bigstick Productions.

===1980–2000: Success in Hollywood===

Douglas&#x27; acting career was propelled to fame when he produced and starred in the 1984 romantic adventure comedy &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. It also reintroduced Douglas as a capable leading man, giving director Robert Zemeckis his first box-office success. The film also starred Danny DeVito, a friend of Douglas&#x27; with who he had shared an apartment in the 1960s. It was followed a year later by a sequel, &quot;The Jewel of the Nile&quot;, which he also produced. Bigstick Productions was then partnered with Mercury Entertainment, a company backed by producer Michael Phillips in 1986 to produce independently financed features. In the 1980s, Douglas formed a new film production company, The Stone Group (later renamed Stonebridge Entertainment) with partner Rick Bieber.

In 1987, Douglas starred in the thriller &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; with Glenn Close. That same year he played tycoon Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Wall Street&quot; for which he received an Academy Award as Best Actor. He reprised his role as Gekko in the sequel &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot; in 2010, also directed by Stone.

Douglas starred in the 1989 film &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;, which also starred Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito. In 1989 he starred in Ridley Scott&#x27;s international police crime drama &quot;Black Rain&quot; opposite Andy García and Kate Capshaw; the film was shot in Osaka, Japan.

In 1992, Douglas founded the short-lived Atlantic Records distributed label Third Stone Records. He founded the label with record producer Richard Rudolph, who became the company&#x27;s president and CEO. Among the acts signed to Third Stone were Saigon Kick and Nona Gaye.

That same year, Douglas had another successful starring role when he appeared alongside Sharon Stone in the film &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;. The movie was a box office hit and sparked controversy over its depictions of bisexuality and lesbianism. In March 1994, Douglas announced that he had formed a new film production company, Douglas/Reuther Productions, in partnership with Steven Reuther. In 1994 Douglas and Demi Moore starred in the hit movie &quot;Disclosure&quot; focusing on the topic of sexual harassment with Douglas playing a man harassed by his new female boss. Other popular films he starred in during the decade were &quot;Falling Down&quot;, &quot;The American President&quot;, &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot;, &quot;The Game&quot; (directed by David Fincher), and a remake of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s classic – &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; – titled &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot;. In 1998 Douglas received the Crystal Globe award for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. On November 19, 1997, Douglas formed his fourth film production company, Furthur Films.

In 2000, Douglas starred in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s critically acclaimed film &quot;Traffic&quot;, opposite Benicio del Toro and future wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones. Douglas and the cast of &quot;Traffic&quot; were awarded a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. That same year he also received critical acclaim for his role in &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;, as a professor and novelist suffering from writer&#x27;s block. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Drama and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

===2001–2012: Established actor===

Douglas starred in &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot; (2001), filmed shortly before his marriage to Zeta-Jones. In 2003, he starred in &quot;It Runs in the Family&quot;, which featured three generations of his family (his parents, Kirk and Diana, as well as his son, Cameron). Although a labor of love, the film was not successful, critically or at the box office. Also in 2003, Douglas starred in &quot;The In-Laws&quot;. Douglas was awarded the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes in 2004. Michael and Kirk Douglas are the only father and son pair to have both been awarded this recognition. He then starred in and produced the action-thriller &quot;The Sentinel&quot; in 2006. During that time, he also guest starred on the episode &quot;Fagel Attraction&quot; of the television sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; as a gay cop attracted to Will Truman (Eric McCormack); the performance earned Douglas an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Show. Douglas was also the voice of founding father Benjamin Franklin in &quot;Freedom: A History of US&quot;, the PBS television adaptation of Joy Hakim&#x27;s 10-volume book A History of US.

Douglas was approached for &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot;, but declined to participate in the project. In 2006, Douglas was Mr. Thompson in &quot;You, Me, and Dupree.&quot; The following year, Douglas played Charlie in &quot;King of California.&quot; In December 2007, Douglas began announcing the introduction to &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. Howard Reig, the previous announcer, had retired two years earlier. That same year, Douglas received the Career Achievement Award from the National Board of Review.

In the late 2000s, Douglas starred in &quot;Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&quot; (2009), &quot;Beyond a Reasonable Doubt&quot;, and &quot;Solitary Man&quot;. In 2009, he was honored with the American Film Institute&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award and the David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures from the Producers Guild of America. In 2011, Douglas voiced Waylon on Disney Channel&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; and starred in the dramatic thriller &quot;Haywire.&quot; He was also honored that year by the French Minister of Culture with the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres with the rank of Commandeur.
In 2012, Douglas was honored with the Monte Cristo Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center for his &quot;monumental achievements and contributions to the American and international theater community.&quot;

===2013–present: Resurgence and expansion===
Douglas collaborated with Steven Soderbergh again on the 2013 film &quot;Behind the Candelabra&quot;, playing Liberace, opposite Matt Damon as Scott Thorson. The film dramatizes the last 10 years of the pianist&#x27;s life and the relationship he had with Thorson. His portrayal of Liberace received critical acclaim, which resulted in him receiving the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. He also won SAG and Golden Globe Awards for the performance. Also that year, he starred in &quot;Last Vegas,&quot; a comedy also starring Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Kline. In 2014, Douglas starred alongside Diane Keaton in the romantic comedy, &quot;And So It Goes&quot; and he produced and starred in &quot;Beyond the Reach&quot;.

He played Hank Pym, the Marvel Comics superhero, in the films &quot;Ant-Man&quot; (2015), &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2019). In 2016, Douglas received his second Cesar d&#x27;Honneur for Career Achievement from the French Cesar Awards; the first was in 1998. In 2017, Douglas starred in the action thriller &quot;Unlocked&quot;. 

In 2018, he starred with Alan Arkin in &quot;The Kominsky Method&quot;, playing Sandy Kominsky, an aging acting coach. He received a Golden Globe Award for his performance. The same year, he starred in a Chinese film, &quot;Animal World&quot;, based on the Japanese manga series &quot;Kaiji&quot;. In 2018, Douglas received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Starting in 2019, Douglas voiced the character Guy-I-Am in the Netflix animated series &quot;Green Eggs and Ham (TV series)&quot;.
In 2023, Douglas again played Hank Pym in &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot; (2023). The &quot;Ant-Man&quot; films were directed by Peyton Reed and starred Paul Rudd. Douglas reprised the role, voicing Hank Pym in the animated series &quot;What If...&quot; (2021-2023).
In May 2023, Douglas was honored with an Honorary Palme d&#x27;or for Lifetime Achievement at the Cannes Film Festival and the Satyajit Ray Lifetime Achievement Award at the 54th International Film Festival of India in November 2023.

In 2024, he starred in the Apple TV+ miniseries &quot;Franklin&quot;, portraying Benjamin Franklin during the eight years that he spent in France attempting to convince King Louis XVI to support the burgeoning United States in the American Revolutionary War.

== Acting style and reception ==
According to film historian and critic David Thomson, Douglas was capable of playing characters who were &quot;weak, culpable, morally indolent, compromised, and greedy for illicit sensation without losing that basic probity or potential for ethical character that we require of a hero&quot;. Critic and author Rob Edelman points out similarities in many of Douglas&#x27; roles, writing that in some of his leading films, he personified the &quot;contemporary, Caucasian middle-to-upper-class American male who finds himself the brunt of female anger because of real or imagined sexual slights&quot;.

These themes of perceived male victimization are seen in films such as &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (1987) with Glenn Close, &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; (1989) with Kathleen Turner, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992) with Sharon Stone, &quot;Falling Down&quot; (1993), and &quot;Disclosure&quot; (1994) with Demi Moore. For his characters in films such as these, &quot;any kind of sexual contact with someone other than his mate and the mother of his children is destined to come at a costly price.&quot; Edelman describes his characters as the &quot;Everyman who must contend with, and be victimized by, these women and their raging, psychotic sexuality&quot;.

Conversely, Douglas also played powerful characters with dominating personalities, including Gordon Gekko, in the &quot;Wall Street&quot; franchise, who was described as the &quot;greedy yuppie personification of the Me generation,&quot; and says &quot;greed is good&quot; in the movie; in &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; and &quot;The Jewel of the Nile,&quot; he played an idealistic soldier of fortune; in &quot;The Star Chamber&quot; (1983), he was a court judge fed up with an inadequate legal system, leading him to become involved with a vigilante group; and in &quot;Black Rain&quot; (1989), he proved he could also play a Stallone-like action hero as a New York City cop.

Having become recognized as a successful producer and actor, he describes himself as &quot;an actor first and a producer second&quot;. He has explained why he enjoys both functions:

== Acting credits and accolades ==
Over his career he has received two Academy Awards, a BAFTA Award. five Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. He has also received several honors such as the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2009, two Honorary Césars in 1998 and 2016, a Film Society at Lincoln Center Gala Tribute in 2010, a Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2004, and a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2018.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and relationships===

After the filming of &quot;Summertree&quot; in 1971, Douglas began dating actress Brenda Vaccaro, a relationship that lasted nearly six years.

In March 1977, Douglas married Diandra Luker, 12 years his junior and the daughter of an Austrian diplomat. They had one son, Cameron, born in 1978. In 1995, Diandra filed for divorce and was awarded $45 million as part of the divorce settlement.

In March 1999, Douglas began dating Welsh actress Catherine Zeta-Jones. The pair married on November 18, 2000. Zeta-Jones says that when they met in Deauville, France, Douglas said, &quot;I want to father your children.&quot; They have two children, son Dylan Michael (born August 8, 2000) and daughter Carys Zeta (born April 20, 2003). The family has a coastal estate near Valldemossa, Mallorca.

In August 2013, &quot;People&quot; claimed that Douglas and Zeta-Jones began living separately in May 2013, but did not take any legal action towards separation or divorce. A representative for Zeta-Jones subsequently confirmed that they &quot;are taking some time apart to evaluate and work on their marriage&quot;. It was reported in November, that the couple had reconciled and Zeta-Jones moved back into their New York apartment.

===Legal issues===
In 1997, New York caddie James Parker sued Douglas for $25 million. Parker accused Douglas of hitting him in the groin with an errant golf ball, causing Parker great distress. The case was later settled out of court.

In 2004, Douglas and Zeta-Jones took legal action against stalker Dawnette Knight, who was accused of sending violent letters to the couple that contained graphic threats on Zeta-Jones&#x27; life. Testifying, Zeta-Jones said the threats left her so shaken she feared a nervous breakdown. Knight claimed she was in love with Douglas and admitted to the offenses, which took place between October 2003 and May 2004. She was sentenced to three years in prison.

===Health issues===
In 1980, Douglas was involved in a serious skiing accident which sidelined his acting career for three years. On September 17, 1992, the same year &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; came out, he began a 30-day treatment for alcoholism and drug addiction at Sierra Tucson Center.

It was announced on August 16, 2010, that Douglas was suffering from throat cancer (later revealed to have been tongue cancer), and would undergo chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He subsequently confirmed that the cancer was at stage IV, an advanced stage.

Douglas credits the discovery of his cancer to the public Canadian health system when a doctor in Montreal, Quebec diagnosed the actor&#x27;s medical condition after numerous American specialists failed to do so. Douglas has since participated in fundraisers for Montreal&#x27;s Jewish General Hospital, where he was diagnosed, and the McGill University Health Centre with which the hospital is affiliated.

Douglas attributed the cancer to stress, his previous alcohol abuse, and years of heavy smoking. In July 2011, &quot;Star&quot; magazine published photographs which appeared to show him smoking a cigarette while on holiday that month. A representative declined to comment on the photographs.

In November 2010, Douglas&#x27; doctors put him on a weight-gain diet due to excessive weight loss that left him weak. On January 11, 2011, he said that the tumor was gone, though the illness and aggressive treatment had caused him to lose 32 pounds (14.5 kg). He said he would require monthly screenings because of a high chance of recurrence within three years. In June 2013, Douglas told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that his type of cancer is caused by the human papilloma virus transmitted by cunnilingus, leading some media to report this as well. His spokesman denied these reports and portrayed Douglas&#x27; conversation with &quot;The Guardian&quot; as general and not referring specifically to his diagnosis.

Although Douglas described the cancer as throat cancer, it was publicly speculated that he may have been diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer. In October 2013, Douglas said he suffered from tongue cancer, not throat cancer. He announced it as throat cancer upon the advice of his physician, who felt it would be unwise to reveal that he had tongue cancer given its negative prognosis and potential for disfigurement, particularly because the announcement came immediately before Douglas&#x27; promotional tour for &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot;.

===Faith and charity work===
Douglas was born to a Jewish father and an Anglican (Church of England) mother. His cousin, the Right Reverend Nicholas Dill, is the bishop of the established Anglican Church of Bermuda. Douglas was not raised with a religious affiliation but stated in January 2015, that he now identifies as a Reform Jew. His son, Dylan, had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony and the Douglas family traveled to Jerusalem to mark the occasion.

Douglas received the 2015 Genesis Prize, a $1 million prize awarded by the Genesis Prize Foundation for Jewish achievement. He donated the prize money to activities designed to raise awareness about inclusion and diversity in Jewish life and to find innovative solutions to pressing global and community problems.

Michael Douglas has been involved in various charitable activities, focusing on healthcare, nuclear disarmament, and human rights. Since 1998, he has served as a United Nations Messenger of Peace, primarily concentrating on disarmament issues. Douglas has supported the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund, which aids those in the entertainment industry, and has participated in fundraising efforts for the Jewish General Hospital and the McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, where he was diagnosed with cancer. Additionally, he has been involved with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation and the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson&#x27;s Research. Michael Douglas has also raised awareness about the link between human papillomavirus (HPV) and oropharyngeal cancer, citing medical evidence and his diagnosis to promote public health education and preventive measures. He was featured in the &quot;100 Influential Celebrities in Oncology: The 2023 Edition&quot; by OncoDaily for his contributions to public awareness.

===Allegations of sexual misconduct===
In 2018, journalist and author Susan Braudy alleged on &quot;Today&quot;, an NBC morning news show in the United States, and in several other interviews that, that in 1989 when Braudy was in her 40s and working as an assistant to Douglas, he regularly made degrading sexual comments about or to her. She stated this caused her to wear baggy clothing at work, and also recalled a one-on-one script meeting where Douglas allegedly undid his pants and fondled himself with her in the room.

In a preemptive statement, Douglas admitted to using coarse language but categorically denied any other wrongdoing. Zeta-Jones, asked about the allegations while promoting &quot;Cocaine Godmother&quot;, did not address them directly but said that her husband was &quot;110 percent behind&quot; the #MeToo movement and that she was &quot;very, very happy&quot; with his statement.

During the documentary film, entitled &quot;What&#x27;s Going On? Child Soldiers in Sierra Leone,&quot; Douglas interviewed children, and estimated that they were among 300,000 other children worldwide who have been conscripted or kidnapped and forced to fight. Of one such child he interviewed, Douglas stated, &quot;After being kidnapped by a rebel group, he was tortured, drugged, and forced to commit atrocities.&quot;

In August 2014, Douglas was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

<doc id="78783" wikidata="Q234156" url="?curid=78783" title="Joan of Kent">
<text>Joan, Countess of Kent (29 September 1326/1327 – 7 August 1385), known as the Fair Maid of Kent, was the mother of King Richard II of England, her son by her third husband, Edward the Black Prince, son and heir apparent of King Edward III. Although the French chronicler Jean Froissart called her &quot;the most beautiful woman in all the realm of England, and the most loving&quot;, the appellation &quot;Fair Maid of Kent&quot; does not appear to be contemporary. Joan inherited the titles 4th Countess of Kent and 5th Baroness Wake of Liddell after the death of her brother John, 3rd Earl of Kent, in 1352. Joan was made a Lady of the Garter in 1378.

==Early life==

Joan was born on 29 September of either 1326 or 1327 and was the daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, by his wife, Margaret Wake, 3rd Baroness Wake of Liddell. Edmund was the sixth son of King Edward I of England, and his second son by his second wife, Margaret of France, daughter of King Philip III of France. Edmund was always a loyal supporter of his eldest half-brother, King Edward II, which placed him in conflict with that monarch&#x27;s wife, Queen Isabella of France and her lover Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. Edmund was executed in 1330 after Edward II was deposed; and Edmund&#x27;s widow and four children (including Joan, who was only two years old at the time) were placed under house arrest in Arundel Castle in Sussex, which had been granted to Edmund in 1326 by his half-brother the king following the execution of the rebel Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel. It was a time of great strain for the widowed Countess of Kent and her four children. They received respite after the new king, Edward III (Joan&#x27;s half-first cousin), reached adulthood and took charge of affairs. He took on the responsibility for the family and looked after them well.

==Early marriages==

In 1340, at the age of about thirteen, Joan secretly married 26-year-old Thomas Holland of Up Holland, Lancashire, without first gaining the royal consent necessary for couples of their rank. Shortly after the wedding, Holland left for the continent as part of the English expedition into Flanders and France. The following winter (1340 or 1341), while Holland was overseas, Joan&#x27;s family arranged for her to marry William Montagu, son and heir of William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury. It is not known if Joan confided to anyone about her first marriage before marrying Montagu, who was her own age. Later, Joan indicated that she had not announced her existing marriage with Thomas Holland because she was afraid it would lead to Holland&#x27;s execution for treason. She may also have been influenced to believe that the earlier marriage was invalid. Montagu&#x27;s father died in 1344, and he became the 2nd Earl of Salisbury.

When Holland returned from the French campaigns in about 1348, his marriage to Joan was revealed. Holland confessed the secret marriage to the king and appealed to the Pope for the return of his wife. Salisbury held Joan captive so that she could not testify until the Church ordered him to release her. In 1349, the proceedings ruled in Holland&#x27;s favour. Pope Clement VI annulled Joan&#x27;s marriage to Salisbury and Joan and Thomas Holland were ordered to be married in the Church.

Over the next eleven years, Thomas Holland and Joan had five children:

# Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent (1350 – 25 April 1397), who married Lady Alice FitzAlan ( 1350 – 17 March 1416), daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel and 8th Earl of Surrey, and Lady Eleanor of Lancaster.
# John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter and 1st Earl of Huntingdon (c. 1352 – 16 January 1400), who married Lady Elizabeth of Lancaster (c. 1363 – 24 November 1426), daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and Lady Blanche of Lancaster.
# Lady Joan Holland (1356 – October 1384), who married John IV, Duke of Brittany (1339 – 1 November 1399).
# Lady Maud Holland (1359 – 13 April 1392), who married, firstly, Hugh Courtenay (c. 1345 – 20 February 1374), heir apparent to the earldom of Devon, and, secondly, Waleran III of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny and Saint-Pol (1355 – 12 April 1415).
# Edmund Holland (c. 1354), who died young. He was buried in the church of Austin Friars, London.

When the last of Joan&#x27;s siblings died in 1352, the lands and titles of her parents devolved upon her, and she became the 4th Countess of Kent and 5th Baroness Wake of Liddell. Her husband Holland was created Earl of Kent in right of his wife in 1360.

==Marriage to the Black Prince==
The death of Joan&#x27;s first husband, Thomas Holland, in 1360 made her an attractive marriage prospect for Edward, the Black Prince, the son of her half-first cousin King Edward III. Some may infer that evidence of a long-held desire by Edward for Joan may be found in the record of his presenting her with a silver cup, part of the booty from one of his early military campaigns. Although one generation removed from her, he was only three or four years younger than she was (depending on whether she was born in 1326 or 1327). It is suggested that Edward&#x27;s parents did not favour a marriage between their son and their former ward, but this may be contradicted by the fact that King Edward assisted his son in acquiring all four of the needed dispensations for Edward to marry Joan. Among the problems was Edward and Joan&#x27;s birth placement within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity. Queen Philippa (wife of Edward III) had made a favourite of Joan in her childhood. Both she and the king may have been concerned about the legitimacy of any resulting children, considering Joan&#x27;s complicated marital record, but such concerns were remedied by a second ruling of Pope Clement&#x27;s successor Innocent VI that held the initial ruling on Joan&#x27;s previous marriage attempts.

At the king&#x27;s request, the Pope granted the four dispensations needed to allow the two to be legally married. Matters moved fast, and Joan was officially married to the Prince barely nine months after Holland&#x27;s death. The official ceremony took place on 10 October 1361 at Windsor Castle, with the king and queen in attendance. The Archbishop of Canterbury presided.

In 1362, the Black Prince was invested as Prince of Aquitaine, a region of France that had belonged to the English Crown since the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine to Henry II of England in 1152. He and Joan moved to Bordeaux, the capital of the principality, where they spent the next nine years. Two sons were born during this period to the royal couple. The elder son, Edward of Angoulême (1365–1370), died at the age of five. At about the time of the birth of their younger son, the future King Richard II on 6 January 1367, having gone through a difficult 2 days of labor, the Black Prince left her side when he was lured into a battle on behalf of King Peter of Castile and achieved one of his greatest victories. King Peter, however, was later killed, and there was no money to pay the troops. In the meantime, Joan was forced to raise another army as her husband&#x27;s enemies were threatening Aquitaine in his absence.

==Transition to Dowager Princess of Wales==
By 1371, the Black Prince was no longer able to perform his duties as Prince of Aquitaine due to poor health, thus he and Joan returned to England shortly after burying their elder son. In 1372, the Black Prince forced himself to attempt one final, abortive campaign in the hope of saving his father&#x27;s French possessions, but the exertion completely shattered his health. He returned to England for the last time on 7 June 1376, a week before his forty-sixth birthday, and died in his bed at the Palace of Westminster the next day.

Joan&#x27;s son Prince Richard was now next in line to succeed his grandfather Edward III, who died on 21 June 1377. Richard was crowned as Richard II the following month at the age of 10. Early in his reign, the young King faced the challenge of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt. The Lollards, religious reformers led by John Wyclif, had enjoyed Joan&#x27;s support, but the violent climax of the popular movement for reform reduced the feisty Joan to a state of terror, while leaving the king with an improved reputation.

As the king&#x27;s mother, Joan exercised much influence behind the scenes and was recognised for her contributions during the early years of her son&#x27;s reign. She also enjoyed a certain respect among the people as a venerable royal dowager. For example, on her return to London from a pilgrimage to Thomas Becket&#x27;s shrine at Canterbury Cathedral in 1381, she found her way barred by Wat Tyler and his mob of rebels on Blackheath. Not only was she let through unharmed, but she was saluted with kisses and provided with an escort for the rest of her journey.

In January 1382, Richard II married Anne of Bohemia, daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia.

==Death and burial==

John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter, was Joan&#x27;s son by her first marriage; his wife Elizabeth of Lancaster was a daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, brother of the Black Prince. In 1385, while campaigning with his half-brother King Richard II in the Kingdom of Scotland, John Holland became involved in a quarrel with Sir Ralph Stafford, son of the 2nd Earl of Stafford, a favourite of Queen Anne of Bohemia. Stafford was killed and John Holland sought sanctuary at the shrine of St John of Beverley. On the king&#x27;s return, Holland was condemned to death. Joan pleaded with her royal son for four days to spare his half-brother, and on the fifth day (the exact date in August is not known), she died at Wallingford Castle. King Richard then relented and pardoned Holland, who was sent on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.

Joan was buried beside her first husband, as requested in her will, at the Greyfriars in Stamford, Lincolnshire. The Black Prince had built a chantry chapel for her in the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral in Kent (where he himself was buried), with ceiling bosses sculpted with likenesses of her face. Another boss in the north nave aisle is also said to show her face.

<doc id="78788" wikidata="Q124864" url="?curid=78788" title="Sparaxis">
<text>Sparaxis is a genus of flowering plants called the harlequin flowers. It belongs to the iris family Iridaceae with about 13 species endemic to Cape Province, South Africa.

All are perennials that grow during the wet winter season, flower in spring and survive underground as dormant corms over summer. Their conspicuous flowers have six tepals, which in most species are equal in size and shape.

&quot;Sparaxis bulbifera&quot; has flowers from cream to yellow or purple. &quot;Sparaxis grandiflora&quot; is a similar but larger plant. In cultivation in the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. &quot;Sparaxis tricolor&quot; has bright red flowers with yellow and black centres. Many named hybrid cultivars were bred from &quot;S. bulbifera&quot; and &quot;S. tricolor&quot;.

A group of species with asymmetrical flowers marked in mauve and yellow, including &quot;Sparaxis variegata&quot; and &quot;Sparaxis villosa&quot;, was formerly treated as the genus &quot;Synnotia&quot;.

The genus name is derived from the Greek word &quot;sparasso&quot;, meaning &quot;to tear&quot;, and alludes to the shape of the floral bracts.

<text>Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch is a 1990 novel written by the English authors Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.

The book is a comedy about the birth of the son of Satan and the coming of the End Times. The plot parodies Richard Donner’s 1976 supernatural horror film &quot;The Omen&quot;, with the main character, Adam Young, standing in as a comic version of Damian, the evil child Antichrist in the film. There are attempts by the angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley to sabotage the coming of the end times, having grown accustomed to their comfortable surroundings in England. One subplot features a mix-up at the small country hospital on the day of birth and the growth of the Antichrist, Adam, who grows up with the wrong family, in a village in the wrong country. Another subplot concerns the summoning of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 68 on the BBC&#x27;s survey the Big Read.

Aziraphale, an angel (originally a guardian of the Eastern Gate of Eden), and Crowley, a demon (originally the serpent who tempted Eve), have lived on Earth since its creation. Over the millennia, they have formed an odd relationship and taken a liking to humanity. One night, the forces of Hell deliver the infant Antichrist to Crowley, with instructions to swap him with the son of an American diplomat stationed in Britain, which is how the Antichrist is planted on Earth in The Omen. Crowley realizes this means that the Apocalypse is coming and persuades Aziraphale to help him prevent it. Together, they decide to influence the Antichrist&#x27;s upbringing by posing as a nanny and a gardener so that the child can never really decide between Good and Evil.

However, due to several misunderstandings at the hospital, the real Antichrist is actually another boy, Adam Young, who grows up unnoticed in idyllic Lower Tadfield, Oxfordshire, together with his three close friends – Pepper, Wensleydale and Brian. As the foretold end of the world nears, Adam begins to unknowingly use his reality-warping powers, changing the world to fit his vision of how things ought to be, such as raising the lost continent of Atlantis after reading about it in a conspiracy theory magazine, summoning UFOs after talking to his friends about aliens, and having the Amazon rainforest reclaim land lost to urban development. In the meantime, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse assemble: War (a war correspondent), Famine (a dietician and fast-food tycoon), Pollution (Pestilence having retired after the discovery of penicillin) and Death (a biker).

Aziraphale and Crowley realize their mistake and begin a frantic search for the Antichrist. Also looking for the boy is Anathema Device, a witch who is trying to prevent the Apocalypse as predicted by her ancestor, Agnes Nutter. Agnes&#x27;s prophecies are perfectly accurate, but many are so cryptic and specific as to be nearly useless, save to the time, place and person they&#x27;re meant for. Anathema is joined by Newton Pulsifer, sole recruit of the Witchfinder Army (and descendent of Thou-Shall-Not-Commit-Adultery Pulsifer, the Witchfinder who burnt Agnes Nutter at the stake), who has been sent to investigate the strange phenomena around Tadfield by Sergeant Shadwell, the Army&#x27;s only other member. Everyone, including Shadwell&#x27;s medium neighbour, Madame Tracy, converges at Tadfield Military Base, where the Four Horsemen are starting a world-ending nuclear war by tampering with the computer systems.

Amid the increasing chaos, Adam is overcome with visions of greatness and attempts to split the world between his gang. When his friends react with horror at what he is becoming, Adam comes to his senses and decides to stop the Apocalypse. He and his friends make their way to the military base and defeat three of the Four Horsemen, with Death accepting defeat and vanishing. A furious Satan starts to ascend to Earth, but Adam, having heard that &quot;his father is coming&quot;, twists reality so that his human adoptive father arrives instead, then modifies everyone&#x27;s memories of recent events.

With Armageddon averted, Crowley and Aziraphale muse that this was God&#x27;s plan all along and speculate that the real apocalyptic conflict will be between humanity and the combined forces of Heaven and Hell. Madame Tracy marries Sergeant Shadwell, effectively disbanding the Witchfinder Army. Anathema begins a relationship with Newton and receives a second book of Agnes&#x27;s prophecies, but decides not to open it, and pass it on to their descendants. Finally, Adam uses his powers to evade his father&#x27;s grounding and watch the circus setting up with his friends.

=== Origins and authorship ===

Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett had known each other since 1985. Gaiman, inspired by his success in writing a biography of Douglas Adams (&quot;Don&#x27;t Panic: Douglas Adams &amp; The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;), and in observing Adams work at close quarters decided to try novel writing, and sent a piece of work to a number of friends, including Pratchett, for feedback. Pratchett responded positively eight months later. According to Gaiman, he began the book as a parody of Richmal Crompton&#x27;s &quot;William&quot; books, named &quot;William the Antichrist&quot;, but it outgrew the original idea. It was their own idea, not that of their publisher, to collaborate on a novel.

Gaiman said:
We were both living in England when we wrote it. At an educated guess, although neither of us ever counted, Terry probably wrote around 60,000 &quot;raw&quot; and I wrote 45,000 &quot;raw&quot; words of &quot;Good Omens&quot;, with, on the whole, Terry taking more of the plot with Adam and the Them in, and me doing more of the stuff that was slightly more tangential to the story, except that broke down pretty quickly and when we got towards the end we swapped characters so that we&#x27;d both written everyone by the time it was done, but then we also rewrote and footnoted each other&#x27;s bits as we went along, and rolled up our sleeves to take the first draft to the second (quite a lot of words), and, by the end of it, neither of us was entirely certain who had written what. It was indeed plotted in long daily phone calls, and we would post floppy disks (and this was back in 1988 when floppy disks really were pretty darn floppy) back and forth.

Pratchett said:
I think this is an honest account of the process of writing &quot;Good Omens&quot;. It was fairly easy to keep track of because of the way we sent disks to one another, and because I was Keeper of the Official Master Copy I can say that I wrote a bit over two thirds of &quot;Good Omens&quot;. However, we were on the phone to each other every day, at least once. If you have an idea during a brainstorming session with another guy, whose idea is it? One guy goes and writes 2,000 words after thirty minutes on the phone, what exactly is the process that&#x27;s happening? I did most of the physical writing because:
# I had to. Neil had to keep &quot;Sandman&quot; going – I could take time off from the DW;
# One person has to be overall editor, and do all the stitching and filling and slicing and, as I&#x27;ve said before, it was me by agreement – if it had been a graphic novel, it would have been Neil taking the chair for exactly the same reasons it was me for a novel;
# I&#x27;m a selfish bastard and tried to write ahead to get to the good bits before Neil.
Initially, I did most of Adam and the Them and Neil did most of the Four Horsemen, and everything else kind of got done by whoever – by the end, large sections were being done by a composite creature called Terryandneil, whoever was actually hitting the keys. By agreement, I am allowed to say that Agnes Nutter, her life and death, was completely and utterly mine. And Neil proudly claims responsibility for the maggots. Neil&#x27;s had a major influence on the opening scenes, me on the ending. In the end, it was this book done by two guys, who shared the money equally and did it for fun and wouldn&#x27;t do it again for a big clock.

===International editions===
The United States edition of &quot;Good Omens&quot; had numerous alterations to the text. The most significant alteration to the main text is the addition of an extra 700-word section just before the end, dealing with what happened to the character of Warlock, the American diplomat&#x27;s son, who was swapped with Adam. The American edition also adds numerous footnotes not found in British editions.

The Dutch translation of &quot;Good Omens&quot; contains a preface by the translator wherein he asserts that no extra footnotes were added to clarify matters that might be unclear to a modern audience – annotated with footnotes explaining &quot;omen&quot; and &quot;Crowley&quot;.

In the French version, some characters were given French-sounding names. Agnes Nutter became Agnès Barge (barge is French for nutter), Anathema Device became Anathème Bidule (Bidule being French for Device). Crowley became Rampa (as &#x27;Crawly&#x27; became &#x27;Crowley&#x27;, &#x27;Rampant&#x27; became &#x27;Rampa&#x27;), after the infamous author of &quot;The Third Eye&quot;, T. L. Rampa. The French publisher of &quot;Good Omens&quot; (J&#x27;ai Lu) was also the French publisher of the T. L. Rampa books.

In the Czech version of the book, the names of Agnes, Anathema, the Satanist nuns, Pepper and some minor characters were translated too. The book contains many extra footnotes as an explanation to some of the phrases that were translated more literally than usual and to add new jokes (for example the part where Anathema meets Adam and tells him she is an occultist, noting: &quot;You were thinking &#x27;Nothin&#x27; wrong with my eyes, they don&#x27;t need examining,&#x27; weren&#x27;t you?&quot; was accompanied by a footnote: &quot;To those who understood what was the point, congratulations. For those whom it took as long as it took me: The Dictionary&#x27;s definition: Oculist – rather an old-fashioned word for an ophthalmologist.&quot;).

===Historical and literary inspirations===
The names of Agnes Nutter and her descendant Anathema Device were inspired by two of the victims of the 1612 Pendle witch trials, Alice Nutter and Elizabeth Device. Gaiman confirmed the homage in a 2016 tweet.

The book is also inspired by parts of &quot;The Book of Revelation&quot;.

==Reception==
According to Gaiman, no one attended an early book signing event in Manhattan. Kirkus Reviews called the novel &quot;hilariously naughty&quot;. It received a starred review from Library Journal, which called it &quot;irreverently funny and unexpectedly wise&quot;. Joe Queenan in a negative review for the New York Times wrote that &quot;Good Omens&quot; was &quot;an experience that will persuade even the most ferociously Anglophilic Yank that the British reading public is every bit as intellectually slovenly as its American counterpart&quot;, and criticized the humor of the novel.

The book has received the following awards:
* World Fantasy Award nominee for Best Novel, 1991
* Locus Award nominee for Best Fantasy Novel, 1991
* Mir Fantastiki Special Award for &quot;The most anticipated book&quot;, 2012
* Won FantLab.ru poll for &quot;Best Translated Novel&quot;, 2012

==Possible sequel==
In 1989, a year before the completed novel was published, Gaiman and Pratchett visited the US for the World Fantasy Convention in Seattle, and shared a hotel room to save money. Unable to sleep at night due to jet lag, and not having anything else to talk about, they started plotting out the sequel to &quot;Good Omens&quot;. &quot;668—The Neighbour of the Beast&quot; was slated as the sequel&#x27;s title; however, after Gaiman moved to the United States, Pratchett expressed doubt that a sequel would be written. Gaiman later affirmed this in one of his essays, titled &quot;Terry Pratchett: An Appreciation&quot;. Pratchett died in 2015. In 2017, Gaiman revealed – as part of the filming of the television series based on the book – that he and Pratchett had done some plotting for the sequel, including that &quot;[t]here would have been a lot of angels in the sequel&quot;, one of whom was Gabriel, who was only briefly mentioned in &quot;Good Omens&quot; but was to figure more prominently in the television series. When asked if Neil had any plans on releasing a sequel to &quot;Good Omens&quot; or maintaining its status as a standalone work, Gaiman stated that there was a plot for one that Pratchett wanted to be told, but that whether or not it would be made would depend on certain factors.

==In other media==
===Film===
A film, to be directed by Terry Gilliam, was planned. As of 2002, Gilliam had still hoped to make the film with its already completed script, but by 2006, it seemed to have come to nothing. Funding was slow to appear, and Gilliam moved on to other projects. There was a rumour that Johnny Depp was originally cast as Crowley and Robin Williams as Aziraphale. However Gaiman has said on his website, &quot;Well, Robin&#x27;s worked with Terry Gilliam before as well, of course, most famously in &quot;The Fisher King&quot;. But I have no idea about &quot;Good Omens&quot; casting (except for Shadwell. Terry told me who he wanted to play Shadwell. I immediately forgot the man&#x27;s name, although I can assure you that it wasn&#x27;t Robin Williams).&quot; According to an interview in May 2006 at &quot;The Guardian&quot; Hay Festival, Gilliam was still hoping to go ahead with the film.

Gaiman confirmed in a 2013 podcast interview with &quot;Empire&quot; that the majority of the funding for the film was in place in 2002, but the project could not attract the initial funding to begin production.

Even in 2008, Gilliam was still hopeful about the project. Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Stardust&quot; (based on his own novel of the same name) and &quot;Beowulf&quot; were successful as films in 2007, which had given the adaptation of &quot;Good Omens&quot; a better chance of being picked up. A Gilliam quote from an &quot;Empire&quot; interview appeared as follows: &quot;And I thought with Neil, with &quot;Stardust&quot; and with &quot;Beowulf&quot; and there&#x27;s another one – an animated film, a Henry Selick thing he&#x27;s written &quot;Coraline&quot; – I was thinking he&#x27;s really hot now, so maybe there&#x27;s a chance. I mean it&#x27;s such a wonderful book. And I think our script is pretty good, too. We did quite a few changes. We weren&#x27;t as respectful as we ought to have been. But Neil&#x27;s happy with it!&quot;

The history of this project and similar experiences with Gaiman&#x27;s various other works (including &quot;The Sandman&quot; series) have led to his cynical view of the Hollywood process, a view which occasionally surfaces in his weblog and in some of his short fiction. Pratchett shared a similar opinion, and was quoted as saying, &quot;The difference between me and Neil in our attitude to movie projects is that he doesn&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re going to happen until he&#x27;s sitting in his seat eating popcorn, and I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re going to happen.&quot; Pratchett had had many of the same issues with Hollywood &#x27;suits&#x27;, but he, too, would have loved to have seen the film made.

===Television===

In February 2011, it was reported that a television adaptation may be produced, with Terry Jones and Gavin Scott &quot;in talks&quot; to write the series. On 19 March 2011, Gaiman announced on his website that a television series adaptation of his novel &quot;is in the works from Terry Jones&quot; with a link to Pratchett&#x27;s webpage confirming the news. In August 2012, Pratchett&#x27;s daughter, Rhianna Pratchett, announced an establishment of a new production company, Narrativia, with plans to produce projects including a television film based on &quot;Good Omens&quot;.

In April 2016, Gaiman announced that he was writing the scripts for a six-part television series as the result of a request from Pratchett, made shortly before his death. In January 2017, Amazon announced that Gaiman would adapt &quot;Good Omens&quot; into a &quot;comedic apocalyptic&quot; miniseries, set to be released on Prime Video in 2019. The adaptation is a six-part limited comedy series for Amazon and the BBC, and Gaiman served as showrunner. On 14 August 2017, Michael Sheen and David Tennant were announced as having been cast in the respective lead roles of Aziraphale and Crowley. The village of Hambleden in Buckinghamshire is the filming location for &#x27;Tadfield&#x27; with Jasmine Cottage being located just north of the village at Colstrope Farm. The adaptation was produced by BBC Studios in collaboration with Narrativia and Gaiman&#x27;s The Blank Corporation. Distribution was handled by BBC Worldwide. All six episodes of the serial were released on 31 May 2019 on Amazon Prime. In June 2021 Amazon renewed &quot;Good Omens&quot; for a second season, with Sheen and Tennant returning alongside most of the original cast, and a third and final season being announced in December 2023.

===Radio===
On 5 September 2014, it was confirmed that the BBC would produce a radio adaptation of the novel, to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4, starting 22 December of that year. Mark Heap and Peter Serafinowicz led the cast, which also included Louise Brealey, Phil Davis, Mark Benton, Colin Morgan, Paterson Joseph, Josie Lawrence, Jim Norton, Adam Thomas Wright and Hollie Burgess. Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett had cameo roles as a pair of traffic cops called &quot;Neil&quot; and &quot;Terry&quot;. The series was broadcast in six episodes starting in December 2014.

===Theatre===
In March 2013, Cult Classic Theatre in Glasgow, Scotland, performed Amy Hoff&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Good Omens&quot; with the permission of Pratchett and Gaiman. In November 2017, Squabbalogic staged a special development reading of &quot;Good Omens: The Musical&quot; in Sydney, Australia with Nancye Hayes, Barry Quin and Paul Capsis.

===Graphic novel===
In May 2023, it was announced that Colleen Doran would adapt &quot;Good Omens&quot; into a graphic novel. In August 2023, the estate of Pratchett created a Kickstarter campaign to fund the graphic novel. The campaign successfully closed on 30 August with over 36,000 backers and over £2.4 million in funding.

<text>Coraline () is a 2002 British dark fantasy horror children&#x27;s novella by author Neil Gaiman. Gaiman started writing &quot;Coraline&quot; in 1990, and it was published in 2002 by Bloomsbury and HarperCollins. It was awarded the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novella, the 2003 Nebula Award for Best Novella, and the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers. &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked &quot;Coraline&quot; #82 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century. It was adapted as a 2009 stop-motion animated film, directed by Henry Selick under the same name.

==Plot==
Coraline Jones and her parents move into an old house that has been divided into flats. The other tenants include former actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible and Mr. Bobo (commonly referred as the &quot;Crazy Old Man Upstairs&quot;), who claims to be training a mouse circus. The flat beside Coraline&#x27;s, which lies behind a big brown door, remains empty.

During a rainy day she discovers a locked door in the living room, which has been bricked up. As she goes to visit her neighbors, Mr. Bobo relays her a message from the mice warning her against going through the door. Miss Spink and Miss Forcible read Coraline&#x27;s fortune on tea leaves and agree that she is in danger. They give her a lucky adder stone that is &quot;good for bad things&quot;. Despite these warnings, Coraline decides to unlock the door when she is home by herself and finds the brick wall behind the door gone. In its place is a long passageway, which leads to a flat identical to her own, inhabited by her Other Mother and Other Father, who are replicas of her real parents. They have button eyes and exaggerated features. In this “Other World”, Coraline finds everything to be better than her reality: her Other Parents are attentive, her toy box is filled with animated toys that can move and fly, and the Other Miss Spink and Miss Forcible perform a cabaret show in their flat. She even finds the feral Black Cat that wanders around the house in the real world can talk, however she learns he is not of the Other World; he only travels from one world. He warns Coraline of the imminent danger, but Coraline pays him no heed.

The Other Mother offers Coraline a chance to stay in the Other World forever, if Coraline will allow buttons to be sewn into her eyes. Coraline is horrified and returns back through the door to go home. Upon her return to her apartment, Coraline finds her real parents are missing, eventually discovering that the Other Mother has kidnapped them. Though frightened of returning, Coraline goes back to the Other World to confront the Other Mother and rescue her parents. In the garden, the Cat advises Coraline to challenge the Other Mother, as “her kind of thing loves games and challenges”. The Other Mother tries to convince Coraline to stay, but Coraline refuses, and is locked behind a mirror as punishment.

In the darkness, she meets three ghost children, each from a different era, who had let the &quot;&quot; sew buttons in their eyes. They tell her how she eventually stopped loving them and cast their spirits aside. The ghost children implore Coraline to avoid their fate, and to help find their souls so that they can leave the Other World and pass on. After the Other Mother releases Coraline from the mirror, Coraline proposes a game in which she must find the ghost children’s souls and her parents, which are hidden throughout the Other World. If Coraline wins, she, her parents and the ghost children may go free. If not, Coraline will let the Other Mother sew the buttons into her eyes.

Coraline goes through the Other World, and overcomes all the Other Mother’s obstacles, using her wits and the adder stone to locate the ghost children’s souls. At the close of the game, the ghost children warn her even if Coraline wins, the Other Mother will not let them go. Having deduced her parents are imprisoned in the snow globe on the mantle, Coraline tricks the Other Mother by saying her parents are behind the door in the drawing room. As the Other Mother opens the door, Coraline throws the cat at the Other Mother, grabs the snow globe, and escapes to the real world with the key. In doing so, she forces the door shut on the Other Mother&#x27;s hand, severing it. Back in her home, Coraline finds her parents safe and with no memory of the events.

That night, Coraline has a dream in which she meets the three children before they move on to the afterlife. They warn her that her task is still not done: the Other Mother&#x27;s severed hand is in Coraline&#x27;s world, attempting to steal the key which opens the door that connects the two worlds. Coraline goes to an old well in the woods by her house, luring the Other Mother’s hand there with the key and casting both down the bottomless well. Coraline returns home, victorious, and prepares to go about the ordinary life she has come to accept and love.

==Characters==
* Coraline Jones is the main character. She is a curious, intelligent, resourceful, and courageous girl. Coraline is often irritated by rain, her &quot;crazy&quot; grown-up neighbors, and not being taken seriously because of her young age. She is described as being &quot;small for her age&quot;.
* Mel Jones is Coraline&#x27;s mother. She is very busy most of the time, and sometimes inattentive, but she loves and cares about Coraline.
* Charlie Jones is Coraline&#x27;s father. He cares about Coraline very much and is kind, brave, and helpful. He makes &quot;creative&quot; food creations that Coraline strongly dislikes. He is usually found working at the house on his computer. He, like his wife, Mrs. Jones, is usually too busy to spend time with Coraline.
* The Cat is a black cat from the real world, who acts as a mentor to Coraline and guides her through her journey. He is unnamed, as he explains that cats do not need names to tell each other apart, but the Other Mother refers to him as &quot;Vermin&quot;. Unlike many of the characters in the novel, he does not have an &quot;Other World&quot; counterpart, as he states that unlike other creatures in the world, cats can &quot;keep themselves together.&quot; He moves freely from one world to the other and is capable of talking in the Other World. He has a sarcastic personality, constantly belittling Coraline, but befriends and helps her escape from the Beldam. He is defiant of the Other Mother, but trembles at the thought of being stuck in the Other World forever.
* The Beldam (also known as The Other Mother) is the main antagonist of the novel. She is an evil, inhuman sorceress and the ruler of the Other World. In her first form, she looks similar to Coraline&#x27;s real mother but taller and thinner, with long black hair that seems to move by itself, black button eyes, paper-white skin, and extremely long, twitchy fingers with long dark red nails. During the course of the novel, she grows taller, thinner, and paler, having little physical similarities to Coraline&#x27;s mother by the end, suggesting she has the ability to metamorphose. She cannot create, but only copy, twist, and change things from the real world when constructing her version of it. She collects children by luring them into her world with food and entertainment, before eventually sewing buttons into their eyes and consuming their souls.
* The Other Father is one of the creations of the Beldam, in the image of Mr. Jones, the Other Father is used to help trick Coraline to stay in the Other World. Like her real father, he has a study and sits there during the day and will not talk to Coraline for long. He does not work, he merely occupies the study, and is not permitted to talk to Coraline without the Beldam&#x27;s influence. He appears to be much more enjoyable than Coraline&#x27;s real father and always tries to be cheerful and fun in front of Coraline. In reality, the Other Father is sad and somewhat nervous. The Beldam ends up punishing him for revealing too much to Coraline—she transforms him into a soft, doughy, grub-like creature, and orders the Other Father to trap Coraline so she cannot win her challenge. He voices his reluctance not to harm her, yet cannot refuse the Beldam&#x27;s orders.
* April Spink and Miriam Forcible are a pair of retired actresses who live in the flat under Coraline&#x27;s. They own many aging Scotties and talk in theater jargon, often referencing their glory days as actresses. In the Other World, they are youthful and perform continuously in front of anthropomorphic dogs. Later in the novel, the Other Spink and Forcible appear to be conjoined twins inside a cocoon-like sac where they possess the second soul. As for the dogs, they appear to be vampire bat hybrids.
* Mr. Bobo is a retired circus performer living in the flat above Coraline&#x27;s and is commonly referred to throughout the story as the &quot;Crazy Old Man Upstairs&quot;. Over the course of the book, he claims to be training mice to perform in a mouse circus, and often brings Coraline messages from them. His Other World counterpart trains rats and is made of rats. 
* The Ghost Children are the spirits of three children, two girls and one boy, who were the previous victims of Beldam. The boy is described as having a dirty face and red trousers. One of the girls has blonde hair with a circle of glittering silver, a dress with a pattern of spider webs, and a pair of silver butterfly wings coming out of her back (implying that she might be a fairy). The other has a brown bonnet and brown dress. They were trapped by the Beldam at different times before Coraline and reside in the dark space behind the mirror. After having their souls restored, they go to the afterlife.

==Adaptations==

===Graphic novel===
A graphic novel adaptation by P. Craig Russell, lettered by Todd Klein and colored by Lovern Kindzierski, was published in 2008.

===Film===
With the help of the animation studio Laika, LLC, director Henry Selick released a stop motion film adaptation in 2009 that received much critical acclaim, and moderate box office success. At the 82nd Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Animated Feature but lost to Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Up&quot;. Although the 2009 film has several differences (one example is the Beldam turning the Other Father into a pumpkin), it still manages to hold relatively strong to the original plot of the book. In the film, Coraline is depicted as having short blue hair and freckles. In the movie, there was an added new character named Wyborn &quot;Wybie&quot; Lovat, a boy about Coraline&#x27;s age who frequently annoyed Coraline at first, but over time, they grow on each other. In the Other World, his copy cannot speak but is an ally to Coraline, and gets punished by the Other Mother when he helps Coraline escape the Other World. At the end of the film, Coraline reaches out to help Wybie tell his grandmother what is behind the little door. The sister of Wybie&#x27;s grandmother was one of the ghost children lost to the Beldam.

===Theatre===

<doc id="78805" wikidata="Q106577" url="?curid=78805" title="Neustria">
<text>Neustria was the western part of the Kingdom of the Franks during the Early Middle Ages, in contrast to the eastern Frankish kingdom, Austrasia. It initially included land between the Loire and the Silva Carbonaria, in the north of present-day France, with Paris, Orléans, Tours, Soissons as its main cities. 

The same term later referred to a smaller region between the Seine and the Loire rivers known as the &quot;regnum Neustriae&quot;, a constituent subkingdom of the Carolingian Empire and then West Francia. The Carolingian kings also created a March of Neustria which was a frontier duchy against the Bretons and Vikings that lasted until the Capetian monarchy in the late 10th century, when the term was eclipsed as a European political or geographical term.

==Name==
The name &quot;Neustria&quot; is mostly explained as &quot;new western land&quot;,
although Taylor (1848) suggested the interpretation of &quot;northeastern land&quot;.
&quot;Nordisk familjebok&quot; (1913) even suggested &quot;not the eastern land&quot; (&quot;icke östland&quot;). Augustin Thierry (1825) assumed &quot;Neustria&quot; is simply a corruption of &quot;Westria&quot;, from &quot;West-rike&quot; &quot;western realm&quot;. In any case, &quot;Neustria&quot; contrasts with the name &quot;Austrasia&quot; &quot;eastern realm&quot;.
The analogy to &quot;Austrasia&quot; is even more explicit in the variant &quot;Neustrasia&quot;.

&quot;Neustria&quot; was also employed as a term for northwestern Italy during the period of Lombard domination. It was contrasted with the northeast, which was called Austrasia, the same term as given to eastern Francia.

==Merovingian kingdom==
The predecessor to Neustria was a Roman rump state, the Kingdom of Soissons. In 486 its ruler, Syagrius, lost the Battle of Soissons to the Frankish king Clovis I and the domain was thereafter under the control of the Franks. Constant re-divisions of territories by Clovis&#x27;s descendants resulted in many rivalries that, for more than two hundred years, kept Neustria in almost constant warfare with Austrasia, the eastern portion of the Frankish Kingdom.

Despite the wars, Neustria and Austrasia re-united briefly on several occasions. The first was under Clotaire I during his reign from 558 to 562. The struggle for power continued with Queen Fredegund of Neustria, the widow of King Chilperic I (reigned 566–584) and the mother of the new king Clotaire II (reigned 584–628), unleashing a bitter war.

After his mother&#x27;s death and burial in Saint Denis Basilica near Paris in 597, Clotaire II continued the struggle against Queen Brunhilda, and finally triumphed in 613 when Brunhilda&#x27;s followers betrayed the old queen into his hands. Clotaire had Brunhilda put to the rack and stretched for three days, then chained between four horses and eventually ripped limb from limb. Clotaire now ruled a united realm, but only for a short time as he made his son Dagobert I king of Austrasia. Dagobert&#x27;s accession in Neustria resulted in another temporary unification.

In Austrasia the Pippinid mayor Grimoald the Elder attempted a coup by forcing the Austrasian king Siegebert III to adopt his son Childebert who succeeded as &quot;Childebert the Adopted&quot;. Grimoald and his son Childebert were arrested by Neustrian forces and executed in Paris. Clovis II, after this execution, again reunited the Austrasian kingdom with Neustria, although temporarily. During or soon after the reign of Clovis&#x27;s son Chlothar III, the dynasty of Neustria, like that of Austrasia before it, ceded authority to its own mayor of the palace.

In 678, Neustria, under Mayor Ebroin, subdued the Austrasians for the last time. Ebroin was murdered in 680. In 687, Pippin of Herstal, mayor of the palace of the King of Austrasia, defeated the Neustrians at Tertry. Neustria&#x27;s mayor Berchar was assassinated shortly afterwards and following a marriage alliance () between Pippin&#x27;s son Drogo and Berchar&#x27;s widow Anstrud of Champagne, Pippin secured his position as mayor of the Neustrian palace.

Pippin&#x27;s descendants, the Carolingians, continued to rule the two realms as mayors. With Pope Stephen II&#x27;s blessing, after 751 the Carolingian Pippin the Short formally deposed the Merovingians and took control of the empire, he and his descendants ruling as kings.

Neustria, Austrasia, and Burgundy then became united under one authority and, although it would split once again into various eastern and western divisions, the names &quot;Neustria&quot; and &quot;Austrasia&quot; gradually fell out of use.

==Carolingian subkingdom==
In 748, the brothers Pepin the Short and Carloman gave their younger brother Grifo twelve counties in Neustria centred on that of Le Mans. This polity was termed the &quot;ducatus Cenomannicus&quot;, or Duchy of Maine, and this was an alternative name for the &quot;regnum&quot; of Neustria well into the 9th century.

The term &quot;Neustria&quot; took on the meaning of &quot;land between the Seine and Loire&quot; when it was given as a &quot;regnum&quot; (kingdom) by Charlemagne to his second son, Charles the Younger, in 790. At this time, the chief city of the kingdom appears to be Le Mans, where the royal court of Charles was established. Under the Carolingian dynasty, the chief duty of the Neustrian king was to defend the sovereignty of the Franks over the Bretons.

In 817, Louis the Pious granted Neustria to his eldest son Lothair I, but following his rebellion in 831, he gave it to Pepin I of Aquitaine, and following the latter&#x27;s death in 838, to Charles the Bald. Neustria, along with Aquitaine, formed the major part of Charles West Frankish kingdom carved out of the Empire by the Treaty of Verdun (843). Charles continued the tradition of appointing an elder son to reign in Neustria with his own court at Le Mans when he made Louis the Stammerer king in 856. Louis married the daughter of the King of Brittany, Erispoe, and received the &quot;regnum&quot; from the Breton monarch with the consent of the Frankish magnates. This unique relationship for Neustria stressed how it had shrunk in size to definitely exclude the Île de France and Paris by this time, as it was distanced from the central authority of Charles the Bald and closer to that of Erispoe. Louis was the last Frankish monarch to be appointed to Neustria by his father and the practice of creating subkingdoms for sons waned among the later Carolingians.

==Carolingian march==

In 861, the Carolingian king Charles the Bald created the Marches of Neustria that were ruled by officials appointed by the crown, known as s, prefects or margraves. Originally, there were two marches, one against the Bretons and one against the Norsemen, often called the Breton March and Norman March respectively.

In 911, Robert I of France became margrave of both Marches and took the title &quot;demarchus&quot;. His family, the later Capetians, ruled the whole of Neustria until 987, when Hugh Capet was elected to the kingship. The subsidiary counts of Neustria had exceeded the margrave in power by that time and the peak of Viking and Breton raiding had passed. After the Capetian Miracle, no further margraves were appointed and &quot;Neustria&quot; was eclipsed as a European political term (present, however, in some Anglo-Norman chronicles and revived as synonymous with English possession of Normandy under Henry V by the St. Albans chronicler Thomas Walsingham in his Ypodigma Neustriae).

<doc id="78806" wikidata="Q37137" url="?curid=78806" title="Contralto">
<text>A contralto () is a type of classical female singing voice whose vocal range is the lowest female voice type.

The contralto&#x27;s vocal range is fairly rare, similar to the mezzo-soprano, and almost identical to that of a countertenor, typically between the F below middle C (F3 in scientific pitch notation) to the second F above middle C (F5), although, at the extremes, some voices can reach the D below middle C (D3) or the second B above middle C (B5). The contralto voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic contralto.

== History ==
&quot;Contralto&quot; is primarily meaningful only in reference to classical and operatic singing, as other traditions lack a comparable system of vocal categorization. The term &quot;contralto&quot; is only applied to female singers; men singing in a similar range are called &quot;countertenors&quot;. The Italian terms &quot;contralto&quot; and &quot;alto&quot; are not synonymous, &quot;alto&quot; technically denoting a specific vocal range in choral singing without regard to factors like tessitura, vocal timbre, vocal facility, and vocal weight. However, there exists some French choral writing (including that of Ravel and Poulenc) with a part labelled &quot;contralto&quot;, despite the tessitura and function being that of a classical alto part. The Saracen princess Clorinde in André Campra&#x27;s 1702 opera &quot;Tancrède&quot; was written for Julie d&#x27;Aubigny and is considered the earliest major role for &quot;bas-dessus&quot; or contralto voice.

== Vocal range ==

The contralto has the lowest vocal range of the female voice types, with the lowest tessitura; it is between tenor and mezzo-soprano.

Although tenors, baritones, and basses are male singers, some women can sing as low (albeit with a slightly different timbre and texture) as their male counterparts. Some of the rare female singers who specialized in the tenor and baritone registers include film actress Zarah Leander, the Iranian &quot;āvāz&quot; singer Hayedeh, the child prodigy Ruby Helder (1890–1938), and Bavarian novelty singer Bally Prell. The Guiness World Record for lowest note by a female is D2, by Helen Leahey.

== Subtypes and roles in opera ==
Within the contralto voice type category are three generally recognized subcategories: coloratura contralto, an agile voice specializing in florid passages; lyric contralto, a voice lighter in timbre; and dramatic contralto, a deep, dark, and bold contralto voice. 

The coloratura contralto was a favorite voice type of Rossini&#x27;s. Many of his roles listed below were written with this type of voice in mind. Lyric contraltos are heavily utilized in both the French and English operatic repertoire. Many of the Gilbert and Sullivan contralto roles are best suited with a lyric contralto voice. Ma Moss in &quot;The Tender Land&quot; is a notable lyric contralto role. The dramatic contralto voice is heard in much of the German operatic repertoire. Erda in &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; and Gaea in &quot;Daphne&quot; are both good examples of the dramatic contralto. 

True operatic contraltos are rare, and the operatic literature contains few roles written specifically for them with most of those roles singing notes outside of their defined range. Contraltos sometimes are assigned feminine roles like Teodata in &quot;Flavio&quot;, Angelina in &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;, Rosina in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, Isabella in &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;, and Olga in &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, but more frequently they play female villains or trouser roles. Contraltos may also be cast in roles originally written for castrati. A common saying among contraltos is that they may play only &quot;witches, bitches, or britches.&quot;

<text>Speed limits on road traffic, as used in most countries, set the legal maximum speed at which vehicles may travel on a given stretch of road. Speed limits are generally indicated on a traffic sign reflecting the maximum permitted speed, expressed as kilometres per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (mph) or both. Speed limits are commonly set by the legislative bodies of national or provincial governments and enforced by national or regional police and judicial authorities. Speed limits may also be variable, or in some places nonexistent, such as on most of the Autobahnen in Germany.

The first numeric speed limit for automobiles was the limit introduced in the United Kingdom in 1861.

 the highest posted speed limit in the world is , applied on two motorways in the UAE. Speed limits and safety distance are poorly enforced in the UAE, specifically on the Abu Dhabi to Dubai motorway – which results in dangerous traffic, according to a French government travel advisory. Additionally, &quot;drivers often drive at high speeds [and] unsafe driving practices are common, especially on inter-city highways. On highways, unmarked speed bumps and drifting sand create additional hazards&quot;, according to a travel advisory issued by the U.S. State Department.

There are several reasons to regulate speed on roads. It is often done in an attempt to improve road traffic safety and to reduce the number of casualties from traffic collisions. The World Health Organization (WHO) identified speed control as one of a number of steps that can be taken to reduce road casualties. As of 2021, the WHO estimates that approximately 1.3 million people die of road traffic crashes each year.

Authorities may also set speed limits to reduce the environmental impact of road traffic (vehicle noise, vibration, emissions) or to enhance the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road-users. For example, a draft proposal from Germany&#x27;s National Platform on the Future of Mobility task force recommended a blanket 130 km/h (81 mph) speed limit across the Autobahnen to curb fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Some cities have reduced limits to as little as for both safety and efficiency reasons. However, some research indicates that changes in the speed limit may not always alter average vehicle speed.
Lower speed limits could reduce the use of over-engineered vehicles.

==History==


In Western cultures, speed limits predate the use of motorized vehicles. In 1652, the American colony of New Amsterdam passed a law stating, &quot;No wagons, carts or sleighs shall be run, rode or driven at a gallop&quot;. The punishment for breaking the law was &quot;two pounds Flemish&quot;, the equivalent of US$50 in 2019. The &quot;1832&quot; &quot;Stage Carriage Act&quot; introduced the offense of endangering the safety of a passenger or person by &quot;furious driving&quot; in the United Kingdom (UK). In 1872, then-President of the United States Ulysses S. Grant was arrested for speeding in his horse-drawn carriage in Washington, D.C.

A series of Locomotive Acts (in 1861, 1865 and 1878) created the first numeric speed limits for mechanically propelled vehicles in the UK; the 1861 Act introduced a UK speed limit of on open roads in town, which was reduced to in towns and in rural areas by the 1865 &quot;Red Flag Act&quot;. The Locomotives on Highways Act 1896, which raised the speed limit to is celebrated by the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run.

On 28 January 1896, the first person to be convicted of speeding is believed to be Walter Arnold of East Peckham, Kent, UK, who was fined 1 shilling plus costs for speeding at .

In 1901, Connecticut was the first state in the United States to impose a numerical speed limit for motor vehicles, setting the maximum legal speed to in cities and on rural roads. Speed limits then propagated across the United States; by 1930 all but 12 states had established numerical limits.

In 1903, in the UK, the national speed limit was raised to ; however, as this was difficult to enforce due to the lack of speedometers, the 1930 &quot;Road Traffic Act&quot; abolished speed limits entirely. In 1934, a new limit of was imposed in urban centers, and in July 1967, a national speed limit was introduced.

In Australia, during the early 20th century, there were people reported for &quot;furious driving&quot; offenses. One conviction in 1905 cited a vehicle furiously driving when passing a tram traveling at half that speed.

In May 1934, the Nazi-era &quot;Road Traffic Act&quot; imposed the first nationwide speed limit in Germany.

In the 1960s, in continental Europe, some speed limits were established based on the V85 speed, (so that 85% of drivers respect this speed).

In 1974, Australian speed limits underwent metrication: the urban speed limit of was converted to ; the rural speed limits of and were changed to and respectively.

In 2010, Sweden defined the &quot;Vision Zero&quot; program, a multi-national road traffic safety project that aims to achieve a highway system with no fatalities or serious injuries involving road traffic.

==Regulations==

Most countries use the metric speed unit of kilometres per hour, while others, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Liberia, use speed limits given in miles per hour.

=== Vienna Convention on Road Traffic ===

In countries bound by the Vienna Conventions on Road Traffic (1968 &amp; 1977), Article 13 defines a basic rule for speed and distance between vehicles:

=== Reasonable speed ===
Most legal systems expect drivers to drive at a safe speed for the conditions at hand, regardless of posted limits.

In the United Kingdom, and elsewhere in common law, this is known as the reasonable man requirement.

The German Highway Code (&quot;Straßenverkehrs-Ordnung&quot;) section on speed begins with the statement (translated to English):
Any person driving a vehicle may only drive so fast that the car is under control. Speeds must be adapted to the road, traffic, visibility and weather conditions as well as the personal skills and characteristics of the vehicle and load.

In France, the law clarifies that even if the speed is limited by law and by local authority, the driver assumes the responsibility to control a vehicle&#x27;s speed, and to reduce that speed in various circumstances (such as when overtaking a pedestrian or bicycle, individually or in a group; when overtaking a stopped convoy; when passing a transportation vehicle loading or unloading people or children; when the road does not appear clear, or risky; when visibility is low, etc.). If drivers do not control their speed, or do not reduce it in such cases, they can be penalized. Other qualifying conditions include driving through fog, heavy rain, ice, snow, gravel, or when drivers encounter sharp corners, a blinding glare, darkness, crossing traffic, or when there is an obstructed view of orthogonal traffic—such as by road curvature, parked cars, vegetation, or snow banks—thus limiting the Assured Clear Distance Ahead (ACDA).

In the United States, this requirement is referred to as the basic rule, as outlined by US federal government law (49 CFR 392.14), which applies in all states as permitted under the commerce clause and due process clause. The basic speed law is almost always supplemented by specific maximum or minimum limits but applies regardless. In California, for instance, Vehicle Code section 22350 states that &quot;No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at speed greater than is reasonable... and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property&quot;. The reasonable speed may be different than the posted speed limit. &quot;Basic rule&quot; speed laws are statutory reinforcements of the centuries-old common law negligence doctrine as specifically applied to vehicular speed. Citations for violations of the basic speed law without a crash have sometimes been ruled unfairly vague or arbitrary, hence a violation of the due process of law, at least in the State of Montana. Even within states, differing jurisdictions (counties and cities) choose to prosecute similar cases with differing approaches.

=== Excessive speed ===
Consequential results of basic law violations are often categorized as &quot;excessive speed&quot; crashes; for example, the leading cause of crashes on German autobahns in 2012 fell into that category: 6,587 so-called &quot;speed related&quot; crashes claimed the lives of 179 people, which represented almost half (46.3%) of 387 autobahn fatalities in 2012. However, &quot;excessive speed&quot; does not necessarily mean the speed limit was exceeded, rather that police determined at least one party traveled too fast for existing conditions. Examples of conditions where drivers may find themselves driving too fast include wet roadways (due to rain, snow, or ice), reduced visibility (due to fog or &quot;white out&quot; snow), uneven roads, construction zones, curves, intersections, gravel roads, and heavy traffic. Per distance traveled, consequences of inappropriate speed are more frequent on lower speed, lower quality roads; in the United States, for example, the &quot;speeding fatality rate for local roads is three times that for Interstates&quot;.

For speed management, a distinction can exist between &quot;excess speed&quot;, which consists of driving in excess of the speed limit, and &quot;inappropriate speed&quot;, which consists of going too fast for the conditions.

=== Maximum speed limits ===
Most countries have a legally assigned numerical maximum speed limit which applies on all roads when no other speed limit indications are present; lower speed limits are often shown on a sign at the start of the restricted section, although the presence of streetlights or the physical arrangement of the road may sometimes also be used instead. A posted speed limit may only apply to that road or to all roads beyond the sign that defines them depending on local laws.

The speed limit is commonly set at or below the 85th percentile speed (the operating speed which no more than 15% of traffic exceeds), and in the US is frequently set below that speed. Thus, if the 85th percentile operating speed as measured by a &quot;Traffic and Engineering Survey&quot; exceeds the design speed, legal protection is given to motorists traveling at such speeds (design speed is &quot;based on conservative assumptions about the driver, the vehicle, and roadway characteristics&quot;). The theory behind the 85th percentile rules is that, as a policy, most citizens should be deemed reasonable and prudent, and limits must be practical to enforce. However, there are some circumstances where motorists do not tend to process all the risks involved, and as a mass, choose a poor 85th percentile speed. This rule, in practice, is a process for &quot;voting the speed limit&quot; by driving, in contrast to delegating the speed limit to an engineering expert.

The maximum speed permitted by statute, as posted, is normally based on ideal driving conditions and the basic speed rule always applies. Violation of the statute generally raises a rebuttable presumption of negligence.

On international European roads, speed should be taken into account during the design stage.

===Minimum speed limits===
Some roads also have minimum speed limits, usually where slow speeds can impede traffic flow or be dangerous. The use of minimum speed limits is not as common as maximum speed limits, since the risks of speed are less common at lower speeds. In some jurisdictions, laws requiring a minimum speed are primarily centered around red-light districts or similar areas, where they may colloquially be referred to as &quot;kerb crawling laws&quot;.

===Middle speed limits===
Traffic rules limiting only middle speeds are rare. One such example exists on the ice roads in Estonia, where it is advised to avoid driving at the speed of as the vehicle may create resonance that may in turn induce the breaking of ice. This means that two sets of speeds are allowed: under and between .

=== Variable speed limits ===
In Germany, the first known experiments with variable speed limit signs took place in 1965 on a stretch of German motorway, the A8 between Munich and the border city of Salzburg, Austria. Mechanically variable message signs could display speeds of 60, 80 and 100 km/h, as well as text indicating a &quot;danger zone&quot; or &quot;accident&quot;. Personnel monitored traffic using video technology and manually controlled the signage. Beginning in the 1970s, additional advanced traffic control systems were put into service. Modern motorway control systems can work without human intervention using various types of sensors to measure traffic flow and weather conditions. In 2009, of German motorways were equipped with such systems.

In the United States, heavily traveled portions of the New Jersey Turnpike began using variable speed limit signs in combination with variable message signs in the late 1960s. Officials can adjust the speed limit according to weather, traffic conditions, and construction. More typically, variable speed limits are used on remote stretches of highway in the United States in areas with extreme changes in driving conditions. For example, variable limits were introduced in October 2010 on a stretch of Interstate 80 in Wyoming, replacing the winter season speed reduction from that had been in place since 2008. This Variable Speed Limit system has been proven effective in terms of reducing crash frequency and road closures. Similarly, Interstate 90 at Snoqualmie Pass and other mountain passes in Washington State have variable speed limits as to slow traffic in severe winter weather. As a response to fog-induced chain-reaction collisions involving 99 vehicles in 1990, a variable speed limit system covering of Interstate 75 in Tennessee was implemented in fog-prone areas around the Hiwassee River. The Georgia Department of Transportation installed variable speed limits on part of Interstate 285 around Atlanta in 2014. These speeds can be as low as but are generally set to . In 2016, the Oregon Department of Transportation installed a variable speed zone on a stretch of Interstate 84 between Baker City and Ladd Canyon. The new electronic signs collect data regarding temperature, skid resistance, and average motorist speed to determine the most effective speed limit for the area before presenting the limit on the sign. This speed zone was scheduled to be activated November 2016. Ohio established variable speed limits on three highways in 2017, then in 2019 granted the authority to the Ohio Department of Transportation to establish variable limits on any of its highways.

In the United Kingdom, a variable speed limit was introduced on part of the M25 motorway in 1995, on the busiest section from junction 10 to 16. Initial results suggested savings in journey times, smoother-flowing traffic, and a decrease in the number of crashes; the scheme was made permanent in 1997. However, a 2004 National Audit Organisation report noted that the business case was unproved; conditions at the site of the Variable Speed Limits trial were not stable before or during the trial, and the study was deemed neither properly controlled nor reliable. Since December 2008 the upgraded section of the M1 between the M25 and Luton has had the capability for variable speed limits. In January 2010 temporary variable speed cameras on the M1 between J25 and J28 were made permanent.

New Zealand introduced variable speed limits in February 2001. The first installation was on the Ngauranga Gorge section of the dual carriageway on State Highway 1, characterized by steep terrain, numerous bends, high traffic volumes, and a higher than average accident rate. The speed limit is normally .

Austria undertook a short-term experiment in 2006, with a variable limit configuration that could increase statutory limits under the most favorable conditions, as well as reduce them. In June 2006, a stretch of motorway was configured with variable speed limits that could increase the general Austrian motorway limit of . Then Austrian Transport Minister Hubert Gorbach called the experiment &quot;a milestone in European transport policy-despite all predictions to the contrary&quot;; however, the experiment was discontinued.

===Roads without speed limits===
Just over half of the German autobahns have only an advisory speed limit (a &quot;Richtgeschwindigkeit&quot;), 15% have temporary speed limits due to weather or traffic conditions, and 33% have permanent speed limits, according to 2008 estimates. The advisory speed limit applies to any road in Germany outside of towns which is either a dual carriageway or features at least two lanes per direction, regardless of its classification (e.g. Autobahn, Federal Highway, State Road, etc.), unless there is a speed limit posted, although it is less common for non-autobahn roads to be unrestricted. All other roads in Germany outside of towns, regardless of classification, do have a general speed limit of , which is usually reduced to at Allée-streets (roads bordered by trees or bushes on one or both sites). Travel speeds are not regularly monitored in Germany; however, a 2008 report noted that on the autobahn in Niemegk (between Leipzig and Berlin) &quot;significantly more than 60% of road users exceed [and] more than 30% of motorists exceed &quot;. Measurements from the state of Brandenburg in 2006 showed average speeds of on a 6-lane section of autobahn in free-flowing conditions.

Prior to German reunification in 1990, accident reduction programs in eastern German states were primarily focused on restrictive traffic regulation. Within two years of reunification, the availability of high-powered vehicles and a 54% increase in motorized traffic led to a doubling of annual traffic deaths, despite &quot;interim arrangements [which] involved the continuation of the speed limit of on autobahns and of outside cities&quot;. An extensive program of the four &quot;E&quot;s (enforcement, education, engineering, and emergency response) brought the number of traffic deaths back to pre-unification levels after a decade of effort, while traffic regulations were conformed to western standards (e.g., freeway advisory limit, on other rural roads).

Many rural roads on the Isle of Man have no speed limits; a 2004 proposal to introduce general speed limits of and on Mountain Road, for safety reasons, was not pursued following consultation. Measured travel speeds on the island are relatively low.

The Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Telangana also do not have speed limits by default.

==== Roads formerly without speed limits ====
Many roads without a maximum limit became permanently limited following the 1973 oil crisis. For example, Switzerland and Austria had no maximum restriction prior to 1973 on motorways and rural roads, but imposed a temporary maximum limit in response to higher fuel prices; the limit on motorways was increased to later in 1974.

Montana and Nevada were the last remaining U.S. states relying exclusively on the basic rule, without a specific, numeric rural speed limit before the National Maximum Speed Law of 1974. After the repeal of federal speed mandates in 1996, Montana was the only state to revert to the basic rule for daylight rural speed regulation. The Montana Supreme Court ruled that the basic rule was too vague to allow citation, prosecution, and conviction of a driver; concluding enforcement was a violation of the due process requirement of the Montana Constitution. In response, Montana&#x27;s legislature imposed a limit on rural freeways in 1999.

Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory had no rural speed limit until 2007, and again from 2014 to 2016. Sections of the Stuart Highway had no limits as part of an open speed limit trial.

==Method==

Several methods exist to set up a speed limit:

* Engineering
* Harm minimization
* Economic optimization
* Expert system

For instance, the &quot;Injury Minimization&quot; (known as Safe System) method takes into account the crash types that are likely to occur, the impact forces that result, and the tolerance of the human body to withstand these forces to set speed limit. This method is used in countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden.

===Operating speed===
The &quot;Operating speed&quot; method sets the maximum speed at or around the 85th percentile speed, referred to as the 85th percentile rule. It refers to a speed where 85% of vehicles travel at or below. This reduces the need to enforce the speed limit, but also allows drivers to fail to select the appropriate travel speed, when they misjudge the risk their environment induces. This is one method used in the United States of America. In France and many other European countries the vehicle traffic law known as V85 uses this principle to set the legal speed limit of a motorway such that 15% of drivers exceed the limit.

Critics of the guideline say that it is inappropriate to let drivers set the speed limit for a road via their own recorded speed. Once a speed limit has been set using the 85% rule, motorists tend to drive faster than that new speed limit. A speed limit set using this methodology also does not take into account the safety of pedestrians in the area or bicyclists using the road.

Public safety advocates have advocated for the Federal Highway Administration to change their guidance on the usage of the 85th percentile rule in updates to &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot;.

==Enforcement==

Speed limit enforcement is the action taken by appropriately empowered authorities to check that road vehicles are complying with the speed limit. Methods used include roadside speed monitoring, set up and operated by the police, and automated roadside speed camera systems, which may incorporate the use of an automatic number plate recognition system.

In 2012, in the UK, 30% of drivers did not comply with speed limits.

In Europe, between 2009 and 2012, 20% of European drivers have been fined for excessive speed.
In 2012, in Europe, 62% of people supported the idea of setting up speed-limiting devices, with adequate tolerance levels in order to limit driver confusion. One efficient scheme consists of penalty points and charges for speeding slightly over the speed limit.

Another possibility is to alter the roadway by implementing traffic calming measures, vehicle activated signs, or safety cameras.

The city of Munich has adopted &quot;self-explaining roads&quot;: roadway widths, intersection controls, and crossing types have been harmonized so that drivers assume the speed limit without a posted sign.

==Effectiveness==

===Compliance===
Speed limits are more likely to be complied with if drivers have an expectation that the speed limits will be consistently enforced.

To be effective and abided by, the speed limits need to be perceived as credible; they should be reasonable regarding factors such as how well the driver can see ahead and to the sides on a particular road. Speed limits also need to conform to road infrastructure, education, and enforcement activity.

In the UK, in 2017, the average free flow speed for each vehicle type is correlated with the applicable speed limit for that 
road type and for motorways and national speed limit single carriageway roads, the average free flow speed is below 
the designated speed limit for each vehicle type, except motorcycles on motorways.

=== Relationship with crash frequency ===
A 1998 US Federal Highway Administration report cited a number of studies regarding the effects of reductions in speed limits and the observed changes in speeding, fatalities, injuries and property damage which followed. Some states increase penalties for more serious offenses, by designating as reckless driving, speeds greatly exceeding the maximum limit.

A 2018 OECD-ITF case study established a strong relationship between speed and crash frequency: when the mean speed decreases, the number of crashes and casualties decreases; to the contrary, when speed increases, the number of crashes and casualties increases. In no case was an increase in mean speed associated with a decrease in the number of crashes or casualties.

South Dakota increased its maximum speed limit from in 1996. Annual surveys of speed on South Dakota Interstate roads show that from 2000 to 2011, the average speed rose from . A 1999 study found that the U.S. states that increased speed limits in the wake of the repeal of federally mandated speed limits had a 15% increase in fatalities.

The &quot;Synthesis of Safety Research Related to Speed and Speed Limits&quot; report sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration, published in 1998, found that changing speed limits on low and moderate speed roads appeared to have no significant effect on traffic speed or the number of crashes, whilst on high-speed roads such as freeways, increased speed limits generally resulted in higher traffic speeds and more crashes. The report stated that limited evidence suggests that speed limits have a positive effect on a system wide basis.

Research in 1998 showed that the reduction of some United Kingdom speed limits to had achieved only a drop in speeds and no discernible reduction in accidents; speed limit zones, which use self-enforcing traffic calming, achieved average speed reductions of ; child pedestrian accidents were reduced by 70% and child cyclist accidents by 48%. Zones where speeds are set at 30 km/h (or 20 mph) are gaining popularity as they are found to be effective at reducing crashes and increasing community cohesion.

Studies undertaken in conjunction with Australia&#x27;s move from speed limits to in built-up areas found that the measure was effective in reducing speed and the frequency and severity of crashes. A study of the impact of the replacement of with speed limits in New South Wales, Australia, showed only a drop in urban areas and a drop in rural areas. The report noted that widespread community compliance would require a combination of strategies including traffic calming treatments. Information campaigns are also used by authorities to bolster support for speed limits, for example the &quot;Speeding. No one thinks big of you.&quot; campaign in Australia in 2007.

==Justification==
Speed limits are set primarily to balance road traffic safety concerns with the effect on travel time and mobility. Speed limits are also sometimes used to reduce consumption of fuel or in response to environmental concerns (e.g. to reduce vehicle emissions or fuel use). Some speed limits have also been initiated to reduce gas-oil imports during the 1973 oil crisis.

===Road traffic safety===

According to a 2004 report from the World Health Organization, 22% of all injury mortality worldwide was from road traffic injuries in 2002, and without &quot;increased efforts and new initiatives&quot; casualty rates would increase by 65% between 2000 and 2020. The report identified that the speed of vehicles was &quot;at the core of the problem&quot;, and recommended that speed limits be set appropriately for the road function and design, along with the implementation of physical measures related to the road and the vehicle, and increased effective enforcement by the police. Road incidents are said to be the leading cause of deaths among children 10–19 years of age (260,000 children die a year; 10 million are injured).

Maximum speed limits place an upper limit on speed choice and, if obeyed, can reduce the differences in vehicle speeds by drivers using the same road at the same time. Traffic engineers observe that the likelihood of a crash happening is significantly higher if vehicles are traveling at speeds faster or slower than the mean speed of traffic; when severity is taken into account, the risk is lowest for those traveling at or below the median speed and &quot;increases exponentially for motorists travelling much faster&quot;.
It is desirable to attempt to reduce the speed of road vehicles in some circumstances because the kinetic energy involved in a motor vehicle collision is proportional to the square of the speed at impact. The probability of a fatality is, for typical collision speeds, empirically correlated to the fourth power of the speed &quot;difference&quot; (depending on the type of collision, not necessarily the same as &quot;travel&quot; speed) at impact, rising much faster than kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy:

formula_1

Braking distance during danger

formula_2

Typically motorways have higher speed limits than conventional roads because motorways have features which decrease the likelihood of collisions and the severity of impacts. For example, motorways separate opposing traffic and crossing traffic, employ traffic barriers, and prohibit the most vulnerable users such as pedestrians and bicyclists. Germany&#x27;s crash experience illustrates the relative effectiveness of these strategies on crash severity: on autobahns 22 people died per 1,000 injury crashes, a lower rate than the 29 deaths per 1,000 injury accidents on conventional rural roads. However, the rural risk is five times higher than on urban roads; speeds are higher on rural roads and autobahns than urban roads, increasing the severity potential of a crash. The net effect of speed, crash probability, and impact mitigation strategies may be measured by the rate of deaths per billion-travel-kilometres: the autobahn fatality rate is 2 deaths per billion-travel-kilometres, lower than either the 8.7 rates on rural roads or the 5.3 rate in urban areas. The overall national fatality rate was 5.6, slightly higher than urban rate and more than twice that of autobahns.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.bast.de 2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 technical report &quot;An Analysis of Speeding-Related Crashes:Definitions and the Effects of Road Environments&quot; by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that about 55% of all speeding-related crashes when fatal listed &quot;exceeding posted speed limits&quot; among their crash factors, and 45% had &quot;driving too fast for conditions&quot; among their crash factors. However, the authors of the report did not attempt to determine whether the factors were a crash cause, contributor, or an unrelated factor. Furthermore, separate research finds that only 1.6% of crashes are &quot;caused&quot; by drivers that exceed the posted speed limit. Finally, exceeding the posted limit may not be a remarkable factor in the crash analysis as there are roadways where virtually all motorists are in technical violation of the law.

The speed limit will also take note of the speed at which the road was designed to be driven (the design speed), which is defined in the US as &quot;a selected speed used to determine the various geometric design features of the roadway&quot;. However, traffic engineers recognize that &quot;operating speeds and even posted speed limits can be higher than design speeds without necessarily compromising safety&quot; since design speed is &quot;based on conservative assumptions about driver, vehicle and roadway characteristics&quot;.

Vision Zero, which envision reducing road fatalities and serious injuries to zero by 2020, suggests the following &quot;possible long term maximum travel speeds related to the infrastructure, given best practice in vehicle design and 100% restraint use&quot;:
&quot;Roads with no possibility of a side impact or frontal impact&quot; are sometimes designated as Type 1 (motorways/freeways/Autobahns), Type 2 (&quot;2+2 roads&quot;), or Type 3 (&quot;2+1 roads&quot;). These roadways have crash barriers separating opposing traffic, limited access, grade separation and prohibitions on slower and more vulnerable road users. Undivided rural roads can be quite dangerous even with speed limits that appear low by comparison. For example, in 2011, Germany&#x27;s -limited rural roads had a fatality rate of 8.7 deaths per billion travel-km, over four times higher than the autobahn rate of 2 deaths. Autobahns accounted for 31% of German road travel in 2011, but just 11% (453 of 4,009) of traffic deaths.

In 2018, an IRTAD WG published a document which recommended maximum speed limits, taking into account forces the human body can tolerate and survive.

===Fuel efficiency===
Fuel efficiency sometimes affects speed limit selection. The United States instituted a National Maximum Speed Law of , as part of the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act, in response to the 1973 oil crisis to reduce fuel consumption. According to a report published in 1986 by The Heritage Foundation, a Conservative advocacy group, the law was widely disregarded by motorists and hardly reduced consumption at all. In 2009, the American Trucking Associations called for a speed limit, and also national fuel economy standards, claiming that the lower speed limit was not effective at saving fuel.

===Environmental considerations===
Speed limits can also be used to improve local air quality issues or other factors affecting environmental quality (e.g. the &quot;environmental speed limits&quot; in an area of Texas). The European Union is also increasingly using speed limits as in response to environmental concerns.
European studies have stated that, whereas the effects of specific speed reduction schemes on particulate emissions from trucks are ambiguous, lower maximums speed for trucks consistently result in lower emissions of CO2 and better fuel efficiency.

==Advocacy==
Speed limits, and especially some of the methods used to attempt to enforce them, have always been controversial. A variety of organisations and individuals either oppose or support the use of speed limits and their enforcement.

===Opposition===
Speed limits and their enforcement have been opposed by various groups and for various reasons since their inception. In the UK, the Motorists&#x27; Mutual Association (est. 1905) was formed initially to warn members about speed traps; the organisation would go on to become the AA.

More recently, advocacy groups seek to have certain speed limits as well as other measures removed. For example, automated camera enforcement has been criticised by motoring advocacy groups including the Association of British Drivers, and the German Auto Club (ADAC).

Arguments used by those advocating a relaxation of speed limits or their removal include:

* A 1994 peer-reviewed paper by Charles A. Lave et al. titled &quot;Did the 65 mph Speed Limit Save Lives?&quot; which states as evidence that a higher speed limit may create a positive shift in traffic to designated safer roads.
* A 1998 report in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; titled &quot;Highways are safe at any speed&quot;, stating when speed limits are set artificially low, tailgating, weaving and speed variance (the problem of some cars traveling significantly faster than others) make roads less safe.
*A 2007 ePetition to the UK government calling for speed cameras to be scrapped on the basis that the benefits were exaggerated and that they may actually increase casualty levels, conducted by Safe Speed, a UK advocacy organisation campaigning for higher speed limits, which received over 25,000 signatures.
* A 2008 declaration by the German Automobile Manufacturer&#x27;s Association calling general limits &quot;patronizing&quot;, arguing instead for variable speed limits. The Association also stated that &quot;raising the speed limits in Denmark (in 2004 from ) and Italy (2003 increase on six-lane highways from ) had no negative impact on traffic safety. The number of accidental deaths even declined&quot;.
*In a 2010 ADAC report, it was said that an autobahn speed limit was unnecessary because numerous countries with a general highway speed limit had worse safety records than Germany. However, more recent data show that Germany ranks in the lower middle field in a Europe-wide comparison regarding the number of fatalities per billion vehicle kilometers traveled on motorways. ETSC considers that those data are not comparable, because estimations of the number of kilometers traveled are not estimated the same way in different countries. Since 2020, the ADAC is &quot;&quot; (&quot;no longer in principle&quot;) against a speed limit on autobahns.

===Support===
Various other advocacy groups press for stricter limits and better enforcement. The Pedestrians Association was formed in the United Kingdom in 1929 to protect the interests of the pedestrian. Their president published a critique of motoring legislation and the influence of motoring groups in 1947 titled &quot;Murder most foul&quot;, which laid out in an emotional but detailed view of the situation as they saw it, calling for tighter speed limits. Historically, the Pedestrians&#x27; Association and the Automobile Association were described as &quot;bitterly opposed&quot; in the early years of United Kingdom motoring legislation. More recently organisations such as RoadPeace, Twenty is Plenty, and Vision Zero have campaigned for lower speed limits in residential areas. In the United States, advocacy groups favoring stricter limits and better enforcement include the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Safety Council.

In the US, the DOT FHWA has written in a report that &quot;For a given roadway type, there is a strong statistical relationship between speed and crash risk for speeds in the range of 15 mph to 75 mph (25 km/h to 120 km/h). When the mean speed of traffic is reduced, the number of crashes and the severity of injuries will almost always go down.&quot;.

== Signage ==

 Most countries worldwide measure speed limits in kilometres per hour, while the United Kingdom, United States, and several smaller countries measure speed limits in miles per hour instead. Signs in Samoa display both units simultaneously.

There are two basic designs for speed limit signs: the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals specifies a white or yellow circle with a red border, while the &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MUTCD) published by the United States Federal Highway Administration specifies a white rectangle with the legend &quot;SPEED LIMIT&quot;. Vienna-style speed limit signs originated in Europe and are used in most of the world, including many countries that otherwise follow the MUTCD. Variations on the MUTCD design are used in Canada, Guam, Liberia, Puerto Rico, the mainland United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands. Australia also used a variation on the MUTCD design until the country metricated in 1974. The Central American Integration System (SICA) equivalent to the US MUTCD, specifies a variation on the MUTCD design as an option, though not widely used.

In the United States, Canada, Australia and Peru, speed limit signs are rectangular. In most of the United States, speed limit signs bear the words &quot;SPEED LIMIT&quot; above the numeric speed limit, as specified in the MUTCD. However, in Alaska and California, speed limits are often labeled &quot;MAXIMUM SPEED&quot; instead. In Oregon, most speed limit signs are simply labeled &quot;SPEED&quot;. Canada has similar signs bearing the legend &quot;MAXIMUM&quot;, which has a similar meaning in English and French, the country&#x27;s two main languages. Peru uses a similar, reversed variation of the MUTCD order in which the words &quot;VELOCIDAD MAXIMA&quot; (speed limit) are placed below the numeric limit. Australia uses the same rectangular design, but inscribes the numeric speed limit within a red circle as in Vienna Convention signs. The MUTCD formerly specified an optional metric design that included the words &quot;SPEED LIMIT&quot; and the numeric limit inscribed within a black circle, though it was rarely used in the United States; this design is still occasionally found in Liberia. Speed limit signs of Mexico and Panama are square, unlike the United States.

In the European Union, large signposts showing the national (maximum) speed limits of the respective country are usually erected immediately after border crossings, with a repeater sign some after the first. Some places provide an additional &quot;speed zone ahead&quot; ahead of the restriction, and speed limit reminder signs may appear at regular intervals, which may be painted on the road surface.

In Ontario, the type, location, and frequency of speed limit signs are covered by regulation 615 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act.

=== Maximum speed limit ===

Some speed limits are applicable to a zone.
=== Minimum speed limit ===
Minimum speed limits are often expressed with signs using blue circles, based on the obligatory sign specifications of the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. In the United States, minimum speed limit signs are identical to their respective maximum speed limit signs, with &quot;SPEED LIMIT&quot; replaced with &quot;MINIMUM SPEED&quot;. Some South American countries (e.g.: Argentina) use a red border. Japan and South Korea use their normal speed limit sign, with a line below the limit. 
=== Special speed limits ===
In some countries, speed limits may apply to certain classes of vehicles or special conditions such as night-time. Usually, these speed limits will be reduced from the normal limit for safety reasons. 
=== Speed limit derestriction ===
In some countries, derestriction signs are used to mark where a speed zone ends. The speed limit beyond the sign is the prevailing limit for the general area; for example, the sign might be used to show the end of an urban area. In the United Kingdom, the sign means that the national speed limit applies ( on open roads and on dual carriageways and motorways). In New Zealand it means you are on an open road, but the maximum legal speed of still applies. On roads without general speed limits, such as portions of the German Autobahn and rural areas on the Isle of Man, it means the end of all quantitative speed limits.

===Advisory speed limit===
Advisory speed limits may provide a safe suggested speed in an area, or warn of the maximum safe speed for dangerous curves.

In Germany, an advisory speed limit may be combined with a traffic signal to recommend the speed at which drivers should drive to reach the next light at its green phase, thereby avoiding a stop.

==Technology==

Some European cars include in-vehicle systems that support drivers’ compliance with the speed limit, known as intelligent speed adaptation (ISA). ISA supports drivers in complying with the speed limit in various parts of the network, while speed limiters for heavy goods vehicles and coaches only govern the maximum speed. These systems have positive effects on speed behaviour, and improve safety. A speed-limiting device, such as ISA are considered useful by 25% of European car drivers. In 2019, Google Maps integrated alerts for speed traps within its application, along with audible alerts for nearby speed cameras. The technology was first developed by Waze, with requests for it to be removed from the application by police officers.

<text>Chess libraries are library collections of books and periodicals on the game of chess. In 1913, preeminent chess historian H. J. R. Murray estimated the total number of books, magazines, and newspaper columns pertaining to chess to be about 5,000 at that time. B. H. Wood estimated that number, as of 1949, to be about 20,000. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that, &quot;Since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications. No one knows how many have been printed...&quot;

==Libraries==
===Public===
Significant public chess libraries include: 

The John G. White Chess and Checkers Collection at Cleveland Public Library has the largest chess and draughts library in the world, with over 32,000 chess books and over 6,000 bound volumes of chess periodicals.&quot; It was started with the donation of a quarter of a million dollars and 11,000 books from John G. White&#x27;s private library upon his death.

The Chess &amp; Draughts collection at the Bibliotheca Van der Linde-Niemeijeriana (part of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek, the National Library of the Netherlands). The second largest public chess collection in the world is built on the donations of the private chess libraries of Antonius van der Linde, Meindert Niemeijer and G.L. Gortmans. It contains about 30,000 books.

The M.V. Anderson Chess Collection held at State Library Victoria (Melbourne, Australia) is the largest public chess collection in the Southern hemisphere. This contains in excess of 12,000 books and many journal and newsletter titles. Additional titles are added each year. It is based around M.V. Anderson&#x27;s personal collection of 6700 volumes donated between 1959 and 1966. 

The English National Chess Library held at De Montfort University in Leicester holds around 7,000 books building on that of chess writer Harry Golombek
===Private===
Grandmaster Lothar Schmid of Bamberg, Germany reportedly owned the world&#x27;s largest private collection of chess books and memorabilia. In 1992, Hooper and Whyld stated that Schmid&#x27;s chess library &quot;is the largest and finest in private hands, with more than 15,000 items&quot;. In 2008, Susan Polgar stated that Schmid &quot;has over 20,000 chess books&quot;. Dirk Jan ten Geuzendam states that Schmid &quot;boasts to have amassed 50,000 chess books.

David DeLucia&#x27;s chess library contains 7,000 to 8,000 chess books, a similar number of autographs (letters, score sheets, manuscripts), and about 1,000 items of &quot;ephemera&quot;. DeLucia&#x27;s library contains such items as &quot;a 15th-century Lucena manuscript, score-sheets ranging from Fischer&#x27;s Game of the Century against Donald Byrne to all the games of the 1927 New York tournament, eight letters by Morphy, over a hundred Lasker manuscripts, Capablanca&#x27;s gold pocket watch, [and] the contract of the 1886 Steinitz-Zukertort world championship match&quot;. Ten Geutzendam opines that DeLucia&#x27;s collection &quot;is arguably the finest chess collection in the world&quot;.

Former World Champion Anatoly Karpov has a large chess stamp collection.

The Musée Suisse du Jeu in Switzerland has a room devoted to chess, according to number 152 of &quot;EG&quot;, which reports their purchase of Ken Whyld&#x27;s library in 2004. As of January 2010, the British Chess Variants Society was planning to transfer five boxes of archival material related to David Pritchard&#x27;s research for the Encyclopedia of Chess Variants to that collection.

<doc id="78815" wikidata="Q216299" url="?curid=78815" title="Suda">
<text>The Suda or Souda (; ; ) is a large 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world, formerly attributed to an author called Soudas (Σούδας) or Souidas (Σουίδας). It is an encyclopedic lexicon, written in Greek, with 30,000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers.

==Title==
The exact spelling of the title is disputed. The transmitted title (&quot;paradosis&quot;) is &quot;Suida&quot;, which is also attested in Eustathius&#x27; commentary on Homer&#x27;s epic poems; several conjectures has been made, both defending it and trying to correct it in &quot;Suda&quot;.

* Paul Maas advocated for the Σοῦδα spelling, connecting it to the Latin verb &quot;suda&quot;, the second-person singular imperative of &quot;sudāre&quot;, &quot;to sweat&quot;.
* Franz Dölger also defended Σοῦδα, tracing its origins back to Byzantine military lexicon (σοῦδα, &quot;ditch, trench&quot;, then &quot;fortress&quot;).
* Henri Grégoire, starting from a critique to Dölger&#x27;s interpretation, defended a proposal advanced by one of his pupils, and explained the word Σοῦδα as the acrostic of Συναγογὴ ὁνομάτων ὑπὸ διαφόρων ἀνδρῶν σοφῶν, &quot;Collection of names (words) by different learned men&quot;, or alternatively Συναγογὴ ὁνομαστικῆς ὕλης δι&#x27; ἀλφαβήτου, &quot;Collection of lexicographical material in alphabetical order&quot;. This suggestion was also supported by French Hellenist and Byzantinist Alphonse Dain.
* Silvio Giuseppe Mercati wrote on the matter twice: firstly in an article appeared in the academic journal &quot;Byzantion&quot;, and later in an expanded version of the same. He suggested a link with the Neo-Latin substantive &quot;guida&quot; (&quot;guide&quot;), transliterated in Greek as γουίδα and later miswritten as σουίδα. This interpretation was strongly criticized by Dölger, who also refused to publish Mercati&#x27;s first article in the &quot;Byzantinische Zeitschrift&quot;; on the other hand, Giuseppe Schirò supported it.
* Bertrand Hemmerdinger interpreted Σουΐδας as a Doric genitive.

Other suggestions include Jan Sajdak&#x27;s theory that σοῦδα / σουίδα may derive from sanskrit &quot;suvidyā&quot; (which he translated into Latin: &quot;perfecta cumulataque scientia&quot;, &quot;collected and systemized knowledge&quot;); Giuseppe Scarpat&#x27;s link to an unidentified Judas, the supposed author of the Lexicon; and Hans Gerstinger&#x27;s explanation which points at Russian &quot;sudá&quot; &quot;here&quot;, as the answer to the question &quot;τί ποῦ κεῖται;&quot; &quot;what is it and where is it?&quot;. The most recent explanation as of 2024 has been advanced by Claudia Nuovo, who defended Σοῦδα on palaeographical, philological and historical grounds.

==Content and sources==
The &quot;Suda&quot; is somewhere between a grammatical dictionary and an encyclopedia in the modern sense. It explains the source, derivation, and meaning of words according to the philology of its period, using such earlier authorities as Harpocration and Helladios. It is a rich source of ancient and Byzantine history and life, although not every article is of equal quality, and it is an &quot;uncritical&quot; compilation.

Much of the work is probably interpolated, and passages that refer to Michael Psellos (c. 1017–1078) are deemed interpolations which were added in later copies.

===Biographical notices===
This lexicon contains numerous biographical notices on political, ecclesiastical, and literary figures of the Byzantine Empire to the tenth century, those biographical entries being condensations from the works of Hesychius of Miletus, as the author himself avers. Other sources were the encyclopedia of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (reigned 912–959) for the figures in ancient history, excerpts of John of Antioch (seventh century) for Roman history, the chronicle of Hamartolus (Georgios Monachos, 9th century) for the Byzantine age, the biographies of Diogenes Laërtius, and the works of Athenaeus and Philostratus. Other principal sources include a lexicon by &quot;Eudemus,&quot; perhaps derived from the work &quot;On Rhetorical Language&quot; by Eudemus of Argos.

===Lost scholia===
The lexicon copiously draws from scholia to the classics (Homer, Aristophanes, Thucydides, Sophocles, etc.), and for later writers, Polybius, Josephus, the &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;, George Syncellus, George Hamartolus, and so on. The &quot;Suda&quot; quotes or paraphrases these sources at length. Since many of the originals are lost, the &quot;Suda&quot; serves as an invaluable repository of literary history, and this preservation of the &quot;literary history&quot; is more vital than the lexicographical compilation itself, by some estimation.

The lexicon is arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and place in the Greek alphabet (including at each case the homophonous digraphs, e.g. , that had been previously, earlier in the history of Greek, distinct diphthongs or vowels) according to a system (formerly common in many languages) called &quot;antistoichia&quot; (); namely the letters follow phonetically in order of sound according the pronunciation of the tenth century, which was similar to that of Modern Greek. The order is:

In addition, double letters are treated as single for the purposes of collation (as gemination had ceased to be distinctive). The system is not difficult to learn and remember, but some editors—for example, Immanuel Bekker – rearranged the &quot;Suda&quot; alphabetically.

==Background==
Little is known about the compiler of the &quot;Suda&quot;. He probably lived in the second half of the 10th century, because the death of emperor John I Tzimiskes and his succession by Basil II and Constantine VIII are mentioned in the entry under &quot;Adam&quot; which is appended with a brief chronology of the world. At any rate, the work must have appeared by the 12th century, since it is frequently quoted from and alluded to by Eustathius who lived from about 1115 AD to about 1195 or 1196. It has also been stated that the work was a collective work, thus not having had a single author, and that the name which it is known under does not refer to a specific person.

The work deals with biblical as well as pagan subjects, from which it is inferred that the writer was a Christian. In any case, it lacks definite guidelines besides some minor interest in religious matters.

The standard printed edition was compiled by Danish classical scholar Ada Adler in the first half of the twentieth century. A modern collaborative English translation, the &quot;Suda On Line,&quot; was completed on 21 July 2014.

The &quot;Suda&quot; has a near-contemporaneous Islamic parallel, the &quot;Kitab al-Fehrest&quot; of Ibn al-Nadim. Compare also the Latin &quot;Speculum Maius&quot;, authored in the 13th century by Vincent of Beauvais.
