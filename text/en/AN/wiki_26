<text>Sir George Henry Martin (3 January 1926 – 8 March 2016) was an English record producer, arranger, composer, conductor, and musician. He was commonly referred to as the &quot;fifth Beatle&quot; because of his extensive involvement in each of the Beatles&#x27; original albums. Martin&#x27;s formal musical expertise and interest in novel recording practices facilitated the group&#x27;s rudimentary musical education and desire for new musical sounds to record. Most of their orchestral and string arrangements were written by Martin, and he played piano or keyboards on a number of their records. Their collaborations resulted in popular, highly acclaimed records with innovative sounds, such as the 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;—the first rock album to win a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.

Martin&#x27;s career spanned more than sixty years in music, film, television and live performance. Before working with the Beatles and other pop musicians, he produced comedy and novelty records in the 1950s and early 1960s as the head of EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label, working with Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Bernard Cribbins, among others. His work with other Liverpool rock groups in the early mid-1960s helped popularize the Merseybeat sound. In 1965, he left EMI and formed his own production company, Associated Independent Recording.

AllMusic has described Martin as the &quot;world&#x27;s most famous record producer&quot;. In his career, Martin produced 30 number-one hit singles in the United Kingdom and 23 number-one hits in the United States, and won six Grammy Awards. He also held a number of senior-executive positions at media companies and contributed to a wide range of charitable causes, including The Prince&#x27;s Trust and the Caribbean island of Montserrat. In recognition of his services to the music industry and popular culture, he was made a Knight Bachelor in 1996.

==Early years==
Martin was born on 3 January 1926 in Highbury, London, to Henry (&quot;Harry&quot;) and Bertha Beatrice (née Simpson) Martin. He had an older sister, Irene. In Martin&#x27;s early years, the family lived modestly, first in Highbury and then Drayton Park. Harry worked as a craftsman carpenter in a small attic workshop, while Bertha cooked meals at a communal stove in their apartment building. At age 5, George contracted scarlet fever; Bertha, a nurse during the First World War, treated him at home. In 1931, the family moved to Aubert Park in Highbury, where the Martin family first lived with electricity.

When he was six, Martin&#x27;s family acquired a piano that sparked his interest in music. At eight years of age, he persuaded his parents that he should take piano lessons, but those ended after only six lessons because of a disagreement between his mother and the teacher. Martin created his first piano composition, &quot;The Spider&#x27;s Dance&quot; at age eight. Martin continued to learn piano on his own through his youth, building a working knowledge of music theory through his natural perfect pitch.
As a child, he attended several Roman Catholic schools, including Our Lady of Sion (Holloway), St Joseph&#x27;s School (Highgate), and at St Ignatius&#x27; College (Stamford Hill), where he had won a scholarship. When World War II broke out, St Ignatius College students were evacuated to Welwyn Garden City. Martin&#x27;s family left London, with his being enrolled at Bromley Grammar School. At Bromley, Martin led and played piano in a locally popular dance band, the Four Tune Tellers. He was influenced at this time by George Shearing and Meade Lux Lewis. He also took up acting in a troupe called the Quavers. With money earned from playing dances, Martin resumed formal piano lessons and learned musical notation. Martin endured the London Blitz during this time, inspiring an interest in aircraft.

Despite Martin&#x27;s continued interest in music, and &quot;fantasies about being the next Rachmaninoff&quot;, he did not initially choose music as a career. He worked briefly as a quantity surveyor, and later for the War Office as a Temporary Clerk (Grade Three), which meant filing paperwork and making tea.

In 1943, at the age of 17, Martin volunteered for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy, having been inspired by their exploits in the Battle of Taranto in 1940. He trained at HMS &quot;St Vincent&quot; in Gosport. The war ended before Martin was involved in any combat, and he left the service in January 1947. During the war, Martin travelled to New York and saw performances by Cab Calloway and Gene Krupa. He also did nine months of aerial training in Trinidad, becoming a petty officer and aerial observer. On 26 July 1945, shortly after receiving his officer commission as a lieutenant, Martin appeared on BBC radio for the first time during a Royal Navy variety show; Martin played a self-composed piano piece. As he climbed rank in the Navy, Martin consciously adopted the middle-class accent and gentlemanly social demeanour common for officers.

Encouraged by the pianist, teacher and broadcaster Sidney Harrison, Martin used his veteran&#x27;s grant to attend the Guildhall School of Music and Drama from 1947 to 1950. He studied piano as his main instrument and oboe as his secondary, being interested in the music of Rachmaninoff and Ravel and Cole Porter. His oboe teacher was Margaret Eliot (the mother of Jane Asher, who later became involved with Paul McCartney). After that, Martin explained that he had just picked it up by himself. Martin also took courses at Guildhall in music composition and orchestration. After graduating, Martin worked for the BBC&#x27;s classical music department, also earning money as an oboe player in local bands.

==Parlophone==

Martin joined EMI in November 1950 as an assistant to Oscar Preuss, who had served as head of EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label since 1923. Although having been regarded by EMI as a vital German imprint in the past, it was then not taken seriously and used only for EMI&#x27;s insignificant acts. Among Martin&#x27;s early duties was managing Parlophone&#x27;s classical records catalogue, including Baroque ensemble sessions with Karl Haas; Martin, Haas, and Peter Ustinov soon founded the London Baroque Society together. He also developed a friendship and working relationship with composer Sidney Torch and signed Ron Goodwin to a recording contract. In 1953, Martin produced Goodwin&#x27;s first record, an instrumental cover of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s theme from &quot;Limelight&quot;, which made it to no. 3 on the British charts.

Despite these early breakthroughs, Martin resented EMI&#x27;s preference in the early 1950s for short-playing 78 rpm records instead of the new longer-playing and 45 rpm formats coming into fashion on other labels. He also proved uncomfortable as a song plugger when occasionally assigned the task by Preuss, comparing himself to a &quot;sheep among wolves&quot;.

===Head of Parlophone===
Preuss retired as head of Parlophone in April 1955, leaving the 29-year-old Martin to take over the label. Martin soon hired Ron Richards to be his A&amp;R assistant. However, Martin had to fight to retain the label, as by late 1956 EMI managers considered moving Parlophone&#x27;s successful artists to Columbia Records or the His Master&#x27;s Voice, with Martin possibly to take a junior A&amp;R role at the His Master&#x27;s Voice under Wally Ridley. Martin staved off corporate pressure with successes in comedy records, such as a 1957 recording of the two-man show featuring Michael Flanders and Donald Swann, &quot;At the Drop of a Hat&quot;. His work transformed the profile of Parlophone from a &quot;sad little company&quot; to a highly profitable business over time.

====Early music records====
As head of Parlophone, Martin recorded classical and Baroque music, original cast recordings, jazz, and regional music from around Britain and Ireland. He signed singer Dick James, later the music publisher for the Beatles and Elton John, to a recording contract, and reached no. 14 with James&#x27;s theme from &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;.

Martin became the first British A&amp;R man to capitalize on the 1956 skiffle boom when he signed the Vipers Skiffle Group after seeing them in London&#x27;s 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar. They reached no. 10 on the UK Singles Chart in 1957 with &quot;Don&#x27;t You Rock Me Daddy-O&quot;, though their success faded with the end of the skiffle boom. In 1957, Martin signed Jim Dale, hoping the singer would prove Parlophone&#x27;s answer to British rock and roll star Tommy Steele. Dale achieved success as a teen idol, reaching no. 2 on the chart with &quot;Be My Girl&quot;. After recording an album, &quot;Jim!&quot;, in 1958, Dale cut his music career short to pursue his original profession as a comedian, frustrating Martin.

Martin courted controversy in summer 1960, when he produced a cover of the teen novelty song &quot;Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini&quot; and released it mere days after the release of the record in the UK, opening him to public accusations of piracy. Martin&#x27;s version, recorded by 18-year-old Paul Hanford, failed to chart in Britain—though it performed well in several other countries and reached no. 1 in Mexico.

Martin produced two singles for Paul Gadd in 1961. Later better known as Gary Glitter, at this time Gadd used the name &quot;Paul Raven&quot;. Neither single was commercially successful.

Martin&#x27;s first British no. 1 came in May 1961, with the Temperance Seven&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Driving Me Crazy&quot;. Also that year, Martin produced Humphrey Lyttelton&#x27;s version of &quot;Saturday Jump&quot;, which became the theme tune of the influential BBC Radio programme, &quot;Saturday Club&quot;, and scored a success at no. 14 in the charts with Charlie Drake&#x27;s novelty record, &quot;My Boomerang Won&#x27;t Come Back&quot;.

In early 1962, Martin collaborated with Maddalena Fagandini, then working at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, to create two electronic singles, &quot;Time Beat&quot; and &quot;Waltz in Orbit&quot;, which were released as records by the pseudonymous Ray Cathode. Martin also earned praise from EMI chairman Sir Joseph Lockwood for his top-10 1962 hit with Bernard Cribbins, &quot;The Hole in the Ground&quot;. He earned another top-10 hit with Cribbins that year, with &quot;Right Said Fred&quot;. Though Martin wanted to add rock and roll to Parlophone&#x27;s repertoire, he struggled to find a &quot;fireproof&quot; hit-making pop artist or group.

In August 1964, Martin oversaw Judy Garland&#x27;s final studio recording session, with two songs from the &quot;Maggie May&quot; musical.

====Liverpool pop and rock acts====
By late 1962, Martin had established a strong working relationship with Brian Epstein, the Beatles&#x27; manager. Epstein also managed (or was considering managing) a number of other Liverpool music acts, and soon these acts began recording with Martin. When Martin visited Liverpool in December 1962, Epstein showed him successful local acts like Gerry and the Pacemakers and the Fourmost; Martin urged Epstein to audition them for EMI. Gerry and the Pacemakers scored their first no. 1 with their version of &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot;, a song previously rejected by the Beatles, in April 1963. The group&#x27;s next two singles (also produced by Martin), &quot;I Like It&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, also reached no. 1, earning the group the distinction of being the first British act to have their first three singles top the charts.

Martin also produced the Epstein-managed Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, whose first single was a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;, which hit no. 2 on the chart. Kramer and Martin scored two UK no. 1&#x27;s in 1963 and 1964—&quot;Bad To Me&quot; (also Lennon–McCartney original) and &quot;Little Children&quot;. Kramer also reached no. 4 with another Lennon–McCartney song in 1964, &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep You Satisfied&quot;.

Martin began work with the Fourmost in summer 1963 with a cover of one of John Lennon&#x27;s earliest songs, &quot;Hello Little Girl&quot;, which reached no. 9. Their follow-up, released in November, was another Lennon–McCartney work, &quot;I&#x27;m In Love&quot;, which reached the top 20.

Martin also agreed to sign the Beatles&#x27; Cavern Club associate Cilla Black. Her first record was a discarded Lennon–McCartney song, &quot;Love of the Loved&quot;. The record was only a minor hit, reaching no. 35. Martin and Black rebounded in 1964 with two no. 1 hits, &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot;. Black&#x27;s &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot; was the top-selling British single by a female artist in the 1960s.

Between the Beatles, Gerry and the Pacemakers, and Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Martin-produced and Epstein-managed acts were responsible for 37 weeks of no. 1 singles in 1963, finally transforming Parlophone into the leading EMI label.

In December 1964, Gerry and the Pacemakers released &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;, a teaser for the February 1965 film of the same name in the style of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. The soundtrack album featured music by Gerry and the Pacemakers, the Fourmost, Cilla Black, and George Martin-orchestrated instrumental music.

====Comedy records====
Martin produced numerous comedy and novelty records. His first success in the genre was the 1953 &quot;Mock Mozart&quot; single, performed by Peter Ustinov with Antony Hopkins – a record reluctantly released in 1952 by EMI, only after Preuss&#x27;s insistence. In 1956 he produced the well-known children&#x27;s song &quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot; which was released by Parlophone in October of that year. In 1955, Martin worked with BBC radio comedy stars the Goons on a parody version of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, but the song&#x27;s publishers objected to the recording and blocked it from release. The Goons subsequently left Parlophone for Decca, but member Peter Sellers achieved a UK hit with Martin in 1957, &quot;Any Old Iron&quot;. Recognising that Sellers was capable of &quot;a daydreaming form of humour which could be amusing and seductive without requiring the trigger of a live audience&quot;, Martin pitched a full album to EMI. The resultant album, &quot;The Best of Sellers&quot; (1958), has been cited as &quot;the first British comedy LP created in a recording studio&quot;. Both &quot;The Best of Sellers&quot; and its follow-up &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Sellers&quot; (1959) were critical and commercial successes in the UK.

Martin later became firm friends with Spike Milligan, and was best man at Milligan&#x27;s second wedding: &quot;I loved &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, and issued an album of it on my label Parlophone, which is how I got to know Spike.&quot; The album was &quot;Bridge on the River Wye&quot;. It was a spoof of the film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, being based on the 1957 &quot;Goon Show&quot; episode &quot;An African Incident&quot;. It was intended to have the same name as the film, but shortly before its release, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Martin edited out the &#x27;K&#x27; every time the word &quot;Kwai&quot; was spoken, with &quot;Bridge on the River Wye&quot; being the result. The River Wye is a river that runs through England and Wales. The album featured Milligan, Sellers, Jonathan Miller, and Peter Cook, playing various characters.

Martin scored a major success in 1961 with the &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; show cast album, which starred Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett, and Jonathan Miller; the show catalyzed Britain&#x27;s satire boom in the early 1960s. In early 1963, he produced the accompanying soundtrack album for David Frost&#x27;s satirical BBC TV show &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;, recorded in front of a live audience.

Martin frequently used comedy records to experiment with recording techniques and motifs used later on musical records, such as recording magnetic tape at half-speed and then playing it back at normal speed. (Martin used this effect on several Beatles records, such as his sped-up piano solo on &quot;In My Life&quot;.) In particular, Martin was curious to see how tape offered advantages over existing technologies favoured by EMI: &quot;It was still in its infancy, and a lot of people at the studio regarded tape with suspicion. But we gradually learnt all about it, and working with the likes of Sellers and Milligan was very useful, because, as it wasn&#x27;t music, you could experiment. ... We made things out of tape loops, slowed things down, and banged on piano lids.&quot;

===Rivalries and tensions at EMI===

====Salary and royalty disputes====
By the time he signed a three-year contract renewal in 1959, Martin sought—but failed—to obtain a royalty on Parlophone&#x27;s record sales, a practice becoming common in the U.S.: &quot;I reckoned that if I was going to devote my life to building up something which wasn&#x27;t mine, I deserved some form of commission&quot;, he reflected. The issue continued to linger in his mind, and Martin claimed he &quot;nearly didn&#x27;t sign&quot; his spring 1962 contract renewal over this issue—even threatening EMI managing director L. G. (&quot;Len&quot;) Wood that he would walk away from his job. At the same time as the contract dispute, Martin took a work trip in late March 1962 to Blackpool with his secretary, Judy Lockhart Smith. This trip led Wood to discover that Martin had been having an affair with Smith, which further irritated Wood. With their relationship strained, Wood exacted a measure of revenge by having Martin sign the Beatles to a record contract to appease interest from EMI&#x27;s publishing arm, Ardmore &amp; Beechwood.

Martin was also infuriated by EMI&#x27;s refusal to give him a Christmas bonus at the end of 1963—a year in which he had produced seven no. 1 singles and dominated the albums chart—because his £3,000 salary disqualified him from receiving one. &quot;I, naturally, had a chip on my shoulder&quot;, he admitted later. He also advocated that the Beatles&#x27; penny-per-record royalty rate be doubled; Len Wood agreed to this, but only if the Beatles signed a five-year contract renewal in exchange. When Martin countered that EMI should raise the royalty without conditions. Wood grudgingly acquiesced, but Martin believed that, &quot;from that moment on, I was considered a traitor within EMI&quot;.

====Rivalry with Norrie Paramor====
During Martin&#x27;s tenure at Parlophone, he also maintained a rivalry with fellow A&amp;R director Norrie Paramor, head of EMI&#x27;s prominent Columbia label. Before Martin became one of Britain&#x27;s most in-demand producers thanks to his work with the Beatles, he was envious that Paramor had produced highly successful pop acts, such as Cliff Richard. He admitted to looking with &quot;something close to desperation&quot; for similar success. Martin also believed that Paramor&#x27;s habit of forcing Columbia artists to record his own songs as B-sides (thus giving Paramor, who used more than 30 pseudonyms in this practice, a royalty on the single) was unethical. In March 1962, Martin met with a young David Frost to share insider information on the shady business practices of A&amp;R men such as Paramor; this scoop aired in an episode of London AR-TV&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; public affairs programme in November, causing Paramor great embarrassment.

====Conflict with Capitol Records====
In 1955, EMI purchased American recording company Capitol Records. Though this gave Capitol the right of first refusal to issue records in the US from EMI artists, in practice Capitol&#x27;s head of international A&amp;R, Dave Dexter Jr., chose to issue very few British records in America. Martin and his EMI A&amp;R colleagues became irate at how few British records were issued by Capitol, and how little promotion was given for the ones that were issued. In December 1962, Martin complained to EMI managing director Len Wood that he &quot;would not wish to recommend Capitol Records to any impresario who was thinking of launching a future British show in the States&quot;. Dexter passed on issuing the Beatles&#x27; first four singles in the US, driving Martin out of desperation to issue &quot;She Loves You&quot; on the small, independent Swan Records.

Capitol finally agreed to release a Beatles&#x27; fifth single, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, only after Wood met Capitol president Alan Livingston in person, in New York, in November 1963 with an order from EMI chairman Sir Joseph Lockwood to do so. Martin alleged that when he and the Beatles travelled to New York to make their American debut in February 1964, Livingston kept Martin away from the press to minimize EMI&#x27;s role (and promote Capitol&#x27;s) in the Beatles&#x27; success.

Martin and the Beatles resented Capitol&#x27;s practice of issuing records often highly divergent from British record releases. These changes could include the album title, cover art, and songs included. In addition, Dexter frequently altered Martin&#x27;s mixes of Beatles tracks by processing them through Capitol&#x27;s Duophonic mock stereo system. Capitol&#x27;s divergent treatment of Beatle albums did not cease until the band signed a new contract with EMI in January 1967 that forbade such alterations.

===Separation from EMI and start of Associated Independent Recording===
After his repeated clashes over salary terms with EMI management, Martin informed them in June 1964 that he would not renew his contract in 1965. Though EMI managing director Len Wood attempted to persuade Martin to stay with the company, Martin continued to insist that he would not work for EMI without receiving a commission on record sales. Wood offered him a 3% commission minus &quot;overhead costs&quot;, which would have translated to an £11,000 bonus for 1964—though, in doing so, Wood revealed to Martin that EMI had made £2.2 million in net profit from Martin&#x27;s records that year. &quot;With that simple sentence, he cut straight through whatever vestige of an umbilical cord still bound me to EMI. ... I was flabbergasted&quot;, Martin observed. As Martin exited the company in August 1965, he recruited a number of other EMI staffers, including Norman Newell, Ron Richards, John Burgess, his wife, Judy, and Decca&#x27;s Peter Sullivan. Artists associated with Martin&#x27;s new production team included Adam Faith, Manfred Mann, Peter and Gordon, The Hollies, Tom Jones, and Engelbert Humperdinck.

Martin conceived of his new company as being modelled on the Associated London Scripts cooperative of comedy writers in the 1950s and 1960s, offering equal shares in the company to his A&amp;R colleagues and expecting them to pay studio costs proportionate to their earnings. He named it Associated Independent Recording (AIR). Short of startup capital and with many of AIR&#x27;s associated acts still under contract to EMI, Martin negotiated a business arrangement with EMI that would give EMI the right of first refusal on any AIR production. In exchange, EMI would pay a 7% producer&#x27;s royalty on any AIR record by an artist not signed to EMI, and a 2% royalty on records by artists who were signed. A special arrangement was made for Beatles records, wherein AIR was to receive 0.5% of UK retail sales and 5% of the pressing fees EMI generated from licensing records in the US.

Martin&#x27;s departure from EMI and foundation of an independent production company was major news in the music press, with the &quot;NME&quot; calling it a &quot;shock to the recording industry&quot;. Wood attempted to lure Martin back to EMI in 1969 with an offered salary of £25,000, but Martin rejected it. Martin and Wood&#x27;s working relationship ruptured for good in 1973, with Martin vowing to negotiate with EMI only through legal representatives from then on.

==The Beatles==
===Epstein approaches EMI===
In November 1961, new Beatles manager Brian Epstein travelled to London to meet with record executives from EMI and Decca Records in the interest of obtaining a recording contract for his band. Epstein met with EMI&#x27;s general marketing director Ron White, with whom he had a longstanding business relationship, and left a copy of the Beatles&#x27; German single with Tony Sheridan, &quot;My Bonnie&quot;. White said he would play it for EMI&#x27;s four A&amp;R directors, including George Martin (though it later emerged that he neglected to do so, playing it only for two of them—Wally Ridley and Norman Newell). In mid-December, White replied that EMI was not interested in signing the Beatles. By coincidence, Martin gave an interview that week in &quot;Disc&quot; magazine in which he explained that &quot;beat groups&quot; presented unique challenges for A&amp;R directors, and that he sought a &quot;distinct sound&quot; when scouting them.

Martin claimed that he was contacted by Sid Colman of EMI music publisher Ardmore &amp; Beechwood at the request of Epstein, though Colman&#x27;s colleague Kim Bennett later disputed this. In any event, Martin arranged a meeting on 13 February 1962 with Epstein, who played for Martin the recording of the Beatles&#x27; failed January audition for Decca Records. Epstein recalled that Martin liked George Harrison&#x27;s guitar playing and preferred Paul McCartney&#x27;s singing voice to John Lennon&#x27;s, though Martin himself recalled that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t knocked out at all&quot; by the &quot;lousy tape&quot;.

With Martin apparently uninterested, Ardmore &amp; Beechwood&#x27;s Colman and Bennett pressured EMI management to sign the Beatles in hopes of gaining the rights to Lennon–McCartney song publishing on Beatle records; Colman and Bennett even offered to pay for the expense of the Beatles&#x27; first EMI recordings. EMI managing director L. G. (&quot;Len&quot;) Wood rejected this proposal. Separately, Martin&#x27;s relationship with Wood became strained by spring 1962, as the two had strong disagreements over business matters and also Wood&#x27;s disapproval of Martin&#x27;s ongoing extramarital relationship with his secretary (and later wife), Judy. To appease Colman&#x27;s interest in the Beatles, Wood directed Martin to sign the group.

Martin met with Epstein again on 9 May at EMI Studios in London, and informed him he would give the Beatles a standard recording contract with Parlophone, to record a minimum of six tracks in the first year. The royalty rate was to be one penny for each record sold on 85% of records, which was to be split among the four members and Epstein. They agreed to hold the Beatles&#x27; first recording date on 6 June 1962.

===Early Beatles sessions, 1962===
Though Martin later called the 6 June 1962 session at EMI&#x27;s studio two an &quot;audition&quot;, as he had never seen the band play before, the session was actually intended to record material for the first Beatles single. Ron Richards and his engineer Norman Smith recorded four songs—&quot;Besame Mucho&quot;, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, &quot;Ask Me Why&quot;, and &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;. Martin arrived during the recording of &quot;Love Me Do&quot;; between takes, he introduced himself to the Beatles and subtly changed the arrangement. The verdict was not promising, however, as Richards and Martin complained about Pete Best&#x27;s drumming, and Martin thought their original songs were simply not good enough. In the control room, Martin asked the individual Beatles if there was anything they personally did not like, to which George Harrison replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t like your tie.&quot; That was the turning point, according to Smith, as John Lennon and Paul McCartney joined in with jokes and comic wordplay, that made Martin think that he should sign them to a contract for their wit alone. After deliberating for a time whether to make Lennon or McCartney the lead vocalist of the group, Martin decided he would let them retain their shared lead role: &quot;Suddenly it hit me that I had to take them as they were, which was a new thing. I was being too conventional.&quot;

Though charmed by the Beatles&#x27; personalities, Martin was unimpressed with the musical repertoire from their first session. &quot;I didn&#x27;t think the Beatles had any song of any worth—they gave me no evidence whatsoever that they could write hit material&quot;, he claimed later. He arranged for the Beatles to record a cover of Mitch Murray&#x27;s &quot;How Do You Do It&quot; at a 4 September session, with the Beatles now featuring Ringo Starr on drums. The Beatles also re-recorded &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and played an early version of &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, which Martin thought was &quot;dreary&quot; and needed to be sped up. Though Martin was sure &quot;How Do You Do It&quot; could be a hit, the Beatles hated the song&#x27;s style and Murray disliked the Beatles&#x27; recording of it. Additionally, Ardmore &amp; Beechwood protested Martin&#x27;s plan to issue an A-side that was not a Lennon–McCartney song. Martin then reluctantly decided to have &quot;Love Me Do&quot; issued as the A-side of the Beatles&#x27; first single and save &quot;How Do You Do It&quot; for another occasion. (In April 1963, Martin achieved a No. 1 hit with the song as recorded by Beatle contemporaries Gerry and the Pacemakers.)

Martin was dissatisfied with Starr&#x27;s 4 September performance and resolved to use a session drummer for their next recording session. On 11 September 1962, the Beatles recorded &quot;Love Me Do&quot; for a third time with Andy White playing drums, as well as the B-side of their first single, &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;, and a sped-up version of &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. Starr was asked to play tambourine and maracas, and although he complied, he was definitely &quot;not pleased&quot;. Due to an EMI library error, a 4 September version with Starr playing drums was issued on the British single release; afterwards, the tape was destroyed, and the 11 September recording with Andy White on drums was used for all subsequent releases. (Martin later praised Starr&#x27;s drumming, calling him &quot;probably ... the finest rock drummer in the world today&quot;.)

Despite Martin&#x27;s doubts about the song, &quot;Love Me Do&quot; steadily climbed in the British charts, peaking at number 17 in late November 1962. With his doubts about the Beatles&#x27; songwriting abilities now quashed, on 16 November Martin told the band they should re-record &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and make it their second single. He also suggested the Beatles record a full album (LP), a suggestion Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn called &quot;genuinely mind-boggling&quot;, given how little exposure the Beatles had achieved so far. On 26 November, the Beatles attempted &quot;Please Please Me&quot; a third time. After the recording, Martin looked over the mixing desk and said, &quot;Gentlemen, you have just made your first number one record&quot;. Martin directed Epstein to find a good publisher, as he believed Ardmore &amp; Beechwood had done nothing to promote &quot;Love Me Do&quot;; this led them to Dick James, a business acquaintance of Martin.

Martin considered recording the Beatles&#x27; first LP as a live album at their home venue in Liverpool, The Cavern Club, and promoted this idea in an &quot;NME&quot; interview in late November. However, Martin found the Cavern unsuitable for recording during a mid-December visit, and he decided to record the group in the studio instead.

===Commercial breakout, 1963–1964===

====1963====
As Martin had predicted, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; reached no. 1 on most of the British singles charts upon its release in January 1963. &quot;From that moment, we simply never stood still&quot;, he reflected. For the Beatles&#x27; first LP, Martin had the group record 10 tracks to pair with the A- and B-sides of their first two singles—for 14 tracks in total. They accomplished this in one marathon recording session, on 11 February 1963, with the Beatles recording a mix of Lennon–McCartney originals and covers from their stage act. Nine days later, Martin overdubbed a piano part to the song &quot;Misery&quot; and a celesta on &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot;. The resulting album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, became a huge success in the UK, reaching no. 1 on the charts in May and staying there for 30 consecutive weeks until replaced by the Beatles&#x27; second album, &quot;With the Beatles&quot;. &quot;Please Please Me&quot; was the first non-soundtrack album to spend more than one year consecutively inside the top ten of what became the Official UK Albums Chart (with 62 weeks).

At this early stage of their working relationship, Martin played a major role in refining and arranging the Beatles&#x27; self-written songs to make them commercially appealing: &quot;I taught them the importance of the hook. You had to get people&#x27;s attention in the first ten seconds, and so I would generally get hold of their song and &#x27;top and tail&#x27; it—make a beginning and end. And also make sure it ran for about two-and-a-half minutes so that it would fit DJs&#x27; programmes&quot;. &quot;I would meet them in the studio to hear a new number. I would perch myself on a high stool and John and Paul would stand around me with their acoustic guitars and play and sing it. ... Then I would make suggestions to improve it and we&#x27;d try it again&quot;, he recalled. The Beatles&#x27; frenetic recording schedule continued on 5 March 1963, as they recorded &quot;From Me to You&quot;, &quot;Thank You Girl&quot;, and an early version of &quot;One After 909&quot;. Martin altered the arrangement of &quot;From Me to You&quot;, substituting the Beatles&#x27; idea for a guitar intro with a vocalized &quot;da-da-da-da-da-dum-dum-da&quot;, backed by overdubbed harmonica. &quot;From Me to You&quot; reached no. 1 in the UK singles charts in early May, staying there for seven weeks.

The Beatles returned to EMI Studios on 1 July to record a new single, &quot;She Loves You&quot;. Martin liked the song but was sceptical of its closing chord, a major sixth cluster, which he found cliché. The Beatles, now increasingly confident in their songwriting, pushed back. As Paul McCartney recalled, &quot;We said &#x27;It&#x27;s such a great sound it doesn&#x27;t matter; we&#x27;ve got to have it&#x27;&quot;. Martin and recording engineer Norman Smith changed the studio microphone arrangement for &quot;She Loves You&quot;, giving the bass and drums a more prominent sound on the record. &quot;She Loves You&quot; was released in late August and instantly became a massive hit in the UK, signalling the beginning of national Beatlemania and becoming the best-selling UK single by any artist in the 1960s.

Sometime in 1963, Martin and Brian Epstein arranged a loose formula to record two Beatles albums and four singles per year. The Beatles began work on their second LP on 18 July. Like their debut album, this record reflected the repertoire of the Beatles&#x27; contemporary stage act—at this time a mix of Lennon–McCartney originals and American R&amp;B hits, particularly from Motown. Additional album sessions followed on 30 July and into September–October. Martin played piano on several of the tracks, including &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot;, &quot;You Really Got a Hold On Me&quot;, and &quot;Not a Second Time&quot;, and also played Hammond organ on &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;. Martin was particularly impressed with the Lennon–McCartney tune &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Long&quot; and chose it to be the album opener. &quot;With the Beatles&quot; came out on 22 November 1963 and spent 21 weeks atop the album chart.

Martin and the Beatles recorded their next single, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; on 17 October—their first recording session with four-track recording. Impressed with the song, Martin merely suggested adding handclaps and adding compression to Lennon&#x27;s rhythm guitar sound to imitate the sound of an organ. The single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;This Boy&quot;, featured complex three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison that Martin arranged. &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; became another huge seller, staying at no. 1 in the UK for five weeks—and, in January 1964, becoming the group&#x27;s (and Martin&#x27;s) first no. 1 in the US. The song became the US year-end no. 1 record of 1964.

====1964====
On 29 January 1964, Martin and Smith travelled to Paris, where the Beatles were performing a residency, to have them record German-language versions of &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; for the West German market. The Beatles initially refused to record these versions, forcing Martin to barge into their hotel room and insist they come to the studio. They meekly complied, recording &quot;Komm, gib mir deine Hand / Sie liebt dich&quot;. They also recorded what was to be their next no. 1 single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, which was the British year-end no. 1. Martin tweaked the arrangement by having part of the chorus open the song as an intro, so &quot;it grabbed people&quot;.

Martin travelled to New York with the Beatles on 7 February, as the band embarked on their first visit to America—including landmark performances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Martin and Capitol Records planned to record a live album of one of the Beatles&#x27; appearances at Carnegie Hall, but they were stymied by the American Federation of Musicians&#x27; refusal to allow Martin, a non-union member, to participate in the recording.

In late February, the band re-entered the studio and began recording the soundtrack album to the Beatles&#x27; upcoming untitled feature film. The film, album, and lead single were all titled &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. Martin and George Harrison played piano and guitar, respectively, at half-speed for the song&#x27;s solo, which was then played back at normal speed on the record. In addition to producing the Beatles&#x27; original songs for the album—the first and only to exclusively feature Lennon–McCartney songs—Martin orchestrated several instrumental numbers for the film. The film was a success, and the album and single both reached no. 1 in the UK and US when all three were released in July. Martin received an Academy Award nomination for best film score.

When Ringo Starr fell ill with laryngitis just before the Beatles&#x27; 1964 world tour began in early June, Martin recruited session drummer Jimmie Nicol as a temporary replacement. Martin joined them for part of their August/September North American tour, recording their performance at the Hollywood Bowl. (Overwhelming crowd noise made the recording unsuitable for release until, in 1977, Martin spliced some of the performances with others from their 1965 visit to the Hollywood Bowl; this was issued as &quot;The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;, which made no. 2 in the US and no. 1 in the UK.)

The Beatles began recording their next studio album, &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; in August, though the sessions continued intermittently through late October and the record was released on 4 December. Martin observed that the Beatles were &quot;war weary&quot; during many of these sessions, and the album included six covers because Lennon and McCartney had not written enough songs to fill out the record. The album included a February 1965 US no. 1 single, &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; (which was not released in the UK). These sessions also produced a December 1964 single, &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, that reached no. 1 in the UK and US and was among the first pop records to feature feedback. &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; also featured new percussion sounds on several tracks, such as timpani and chocalho. Martin contributed piano on their cover of &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;. &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; was the first album for which the Beatles were present for mixing. The album reached no. 1 in the UK but was not released in the US.

===Shift to studio experimentation, 1965–1966===

====1965====
In mid-February 1965, Martin and the Beatles began five months of sessions to record the music for their second film, &quot;Help!&quot;. The Beatles adopted new studio techniques for these sessions, typically overdubbing vocals and other sounds onto a carefully laid rhythm track. The group by now had grown confident in the studio, and Martin encouraged them to explore new ideas for songs, such as an outro to &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; that was at a faster tempo than the rest of song. (&quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; reached no. 1 in the US and UK upon release as a single.) The band continued to experiment with unusual instruments, such as an alto flute solo for &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; scored by Martin. Notably, it was Martin&#x27;s idea to score a string quartet accompaniment for &quot;Yesterday&quot; against McCartney&#x27;s initial reluctance. Martin played the song in the style of Bach to show McCartney the voicings that were available. &quot;Yesterday&quot; (not released in the UK) became a US no. 1 and one of the most covered songs of all time. &quot;Help!&quot; and its eponymous single topped the charts in both countries.

The group reconvened in October and November to record another album in time for the holiday shopping season. &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; continued the Beatles&#x27; experimentation with new sounds and contained several groundbreaking tracks. &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot; featured George Harrison on sitar, making it one of the first Western pop records to feature Indian instrumentation. (Martin had previously recorded sitar on a 1959 Peter Sellers comedy record.) On &quot;Think For Yourself&quot;, Paul McCartney used a Tone Bender fuzzbox to record a heavily distorted bass line—the first known use of a fuzz pedal on bass guitar. The shimmering electric guitar sound on &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; was achieved by repeatedly reprocessing the signal to increase the treble frequencies, beyond the EQ limits permitted for EMI engineers. Martin himself recorded a baroque-style piano solo on John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;In My Life&quot;, recording the tape at half-speed and playing it back at normal speed so the piano sounded like a harpsichord. Though Martin didn&#x27;t play a harpsichord on the record, &quot;In My Life&quot; inspired other record producers to begin incorporating the instrument in their arrangements of pop records. Martin also composed the notes of the guitar solo Harrison played on &quot;Michelle&quot;, which won the 1967 Grammy Award for Song of the Year.

The &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; sessions also included the double A-sided single &quot;Day Tripper&quot;/&quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, released along with the album in early December 1965. This was Britain&#x27;s first example of a double A-sided record. Both sides reached no. 1 in the UK, and &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; topped the charts in the US. &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; also hit no. 1 in both countries. &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; received strong critical acclaim upon its release and proved highly influential among the Beatles&#x27; musical contemporaries, such as the Beach Boys. Martin sensed a shift in how the group was recording albums:
I think &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was the first of the albums that presented a new Beatles to the world. Up to this point we had been making albums that were rather like a collection of their singles. And now, we really were beginning to think about albums as a bit of art in their own right. We were thinking about the album as an entity of its own, and &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was the first one to emerge in this way.

In early November, Martin scored orchestral renditions of Beatles songs for the taping of the Granada Television special &quot;The Music of Lennon &amp; McCartney&quot;, which aired on 16–17 December.

====1966====
In early January 1966, the Beatles and Martin gathered at CineTele Sound Studios in London to re-record vocal and instrumental tracks from the band&#x27;s August 1965 concert performance at Shea Stadium. The resulting tracks were issued as the soundtrack to the TV documentary, &quot;The Beatles at Shea Stadium&quot;.

The Beatles re-entered EMI Studios in April 1966, with the group&#x27;s exploration of recording at Stax Records&#x27; studio in Memphis—without Martin there to produce—having been scuttled by media leaks. The sessions of the &quot;Revolver&quot; album began with a highly experimental track, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;—a John Lennon song inspired by Timothy Leary&#x27;s book, &quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot;. The song featured several innovations in pop recording, including the use of a tanpura drone loop throughout the song, a backwards guitar solo, sped-up tape loops to produce strange sound effects, and artificial double tracking (ADT) and a rotating Leslie speaker on Lennon&#x27;s vocal. (Martin&#x27;s joking technical description of ADT to Lennon coined the term &quot;flanging&quot; in music.) Martin worked closely with EMI engineers Geoff Emerick and Ken Townsend to achieve these radical effects. Martin added tack piano to the song.

Other &quot;Revolver&quot; tracks featured musical departures for the group, as well. For Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, Martin scored and conducted a strings-only accompaniment inspired by Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score for the Alfred Hitchcock thriller &quot;Psycho&quot;. Emerick placed the studio microphones unusually close to the instruments for this score. George Harrison&#x27;s Hindustani-style &quot;Love You To&quot; included sitar, tabla, and tanpura played by Harrison and musicians from the Asian Music Circle. Lennon&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; was recorded at a fast tape speed and then slowed down to achieve a drowsy, dream-like sound. &quot;Got to Get You Into My Life&quot; became the first Beatles song recorded with a brass section (double-tracked), and &quot;For No One&quot; featured a French horn solo scored by Martin and played by Alan Civil. &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; included nautical-themed sound effects from EMI&#x27;s sound library, many of them from Martin&#x27;s prior productions of comedy records. Martin added a honky-tonk piano solo on &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot;.

The first single produced during the &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions was &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;/&quot;Rain&quot;. Inspired by the pronounced bass sound of contemporary American R&amp;B records, this single featured McCartney&#x27;s Rickenbacker 4001 bass more prominently than previous Beatles records. (This was achieved by surreptitiously flouting EMI&#x27;s equipment rules by using a reverse-wired bass amplifier as a microphone.) &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; featured three-part harmonies arranged by Martin and mixed to have a fluttering echo sound. &quot;Rain&quot;, meanwhile, contained a slowed-down rhythm track and a backwards outro. &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; reached no. 1 in the US and UK. &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; were released along with the finished album as a double A-sided single, with both sides reaching the top of the charts in the UK.

&quot;Revolver&quot; was released in August to highly favourable critical reaction, particularly in the UK. The album received a nomination for the 1967 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Retrospective criticism has recognized it as being among the finest pop albums ever made, with numerous critics listing it at no. 1 all-time.

===&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, 1966–1967===

====&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;====
By the time the Beatles resumed recording on 24 November 1966, they had decided to discontinue touring and focus their creative energies on the recording studio. Martin reflected, &quot;the time had come for experiment. The Beatles knew it, and I knew it.&quot; They began working on a John Lennon composition, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, which began as a simple arrangement of guitar, drums, and Mellotron. They remade the song the next week in a new key and tempo and with added instrumentation, including piano and bass guitar. Between 6–15 December, they attempted yet another arrangement, this time with cellos and a brass section scored by Martin, a large percussion section, swarmandal, and overdubbed backwards cymbals. Lennon asked Martin to combine takes 7 and 26 of the song, even though they were recorded at different tempos and in different keys. Martin, Ken Townsend, and Geoff Emerick accomplished Lennon&#x27;s unusual request by carefully speeding up take 7 and slowing down take 26 so they were nearly equal in key and tempo. Martin mixed the track to include a false ending.

Soon after, the band began work on Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, which featured a piccolo trumpet solo that was requested by McCartney after hearing the instrument on a BBC broadcast. McCartney hummed the melody that he wanted, and Martin notated it for David Mason, the classically trained trumpeter. Martin also orchestrated a larger brass and woodwind score with trumpets, piccolo, flutes, oboe, and flugelhorn.

By January 1967, EMI and Capitol Records executives were restless for a new Beatles single. In mid-February, the group responded by issuing &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;/&quot;Penny Lane&quot; as a double A-side. The single drew critical praise for its musical and recording inventiveness, with &quot;Penny Lane&quot; reaching no. 1 in the US. However, both sides of the single reached no. 2 in the UK, becoming the first British Beatles single in four years not to top the charts. (The sides competed for radio airplay, hurting each side&#x27;s chart performance.) Though the Beatles were not bothered by their failure to reach no. 1, Martin blamed himself for the incident and called it &quot;the biggest mistake of my professional life&quot;.

====&quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;====
The Beatles&#x27; late 1966 sessions stretched into April 1967, forming what became &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;—a record continuing the Beatles&#x27; and Martin&#x27;s imaginative use of the studio to create new sounds on record. Martin was involved as an arranger throughout the album, starting with an overdubbed clarinet section on &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot;, recorded in December 1966.
Martin scored the brass overdubs for the album&#x27;s title track, as well as on &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot;. It was Martin&#x27;s idea to segue the chicken clucking sound at the end of &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; into the guitar lick that opens the reprise of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. For &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, Martin arranged a score that combined Indian and Western classical music. Martin used vari-speed editing to alter the recording speed of several of the album&#x27;s vocal tracks, including &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot;, &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;, and &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;. He and Geoff Emerick superimposed crowd noise sound effects onto the title track and crossfaded the song into &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, mimicking a live performance.

Martin played instruments on several songs, including the piano on &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; and the harpsichord on &quot;Fixing a Hole&quot;. He played numerous instruments in the recording of &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;, including a foot-pumped harmonium, Lowrey organ, glockenspiel, and Mellotron. For the song&#x27;s psychedelic circus-themed instrumental breaks, he had engineers cut tapes of numerous carnival-instrument recordings into tape fragments, then reassemble them at random.

The first Beatles song that Martin did not arrange was &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot;, as he had a prior engagement to produce a Cilla Black session, so McCartney contacted arranger Mike Leander to do it. Martin called this &quot;one of the biggest hurts of my life&quot;, but still produced the recording and conducted the orchestra himself.

Martin applied heavy tape echo to John Lennon&#x27;s voice in &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. He worked with McCartney to implement the 24-bar orchestral climaxes in the middle and end of the song, produced by instructing a 45-piece orchestra to gradually play from their instruments&#x27; lowest note to their highest. The song&#x27;s extended piano fadeout (on which Martin played the harmonium) concluded with a dog&#x27;s whistle and a sped-up tape of the Beatles speaking gibberish on the run-out groove. Music critics have hailed the song as among the Beatles&#x27; best work and a groundbreaking pop record.

&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; cost £25,000 to produce (), far more than any previous Beatles record. During the album&#x27;s recording, Martin periodically worried whether the album&#x27;s avant-garde inventiveness would alienate the general public; such concerns were alleviated by previewing tracks to guests, such as Capitol Records president Alan Livingston, who was &quot;speechless in admiration&quot;. When &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was finally released in early June 1967, it received widespread acclaim from music critics, with a &quot;Times&quot; critic deeming it &quot;a decisive moment in the history of Western civilisation&quot;. The album reached no. 1 in both the US and UK and became the best-selling album in the UK by any artist both in 1967 and for the entire 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mawer/1969&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, it became the first rock album to win a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. &quot;Pepper&quot;″s accolades also raised Martin&#x27;s public profile as a record producer.

====&quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; broadcast====
In May 1967, Beatles manager Brian Epstein agreed (without the Beatles&#x27; knowledge) to have the group record a song live on the world&#x27;s first live global television broadcast, &quot;Our World&quot;, on 25 June. The band decided to record Lennon&#x27;s &quot;All You Need is Love&quot; for the occasion, which they felt would promote a positive message to the world. Martin believed it was too risky to record the entire track on the live broadcast, so he had the Beatles record a backing track on 14 June at Olympic Studios—with the unusual arrangement of Lennon on harpsichord, McCartney on double bass, Harrison on violin, and Starr on drums, with Eddie Kramer as audio engineer. Five days later, at EMI Studios, Martin overdubbed a piano, while Lennon added vocals and a banjo part. The band also asked Martin to write an orchestral score for the song, starting with the beginning of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;. The score for the fade-out of the song included bits from Bach&#x27;s Inventions and Sinfonias, &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, and &quot;In the Mood&quot;. On 23 June, Martin recorded an orchestral track. (Though &quot;In the Mood&quot; was not in copyright, Glenn Miller&#x27;s arrangement of the song was; this forced EMI to subsequently pay a royalty to Miller&#x27;s estate.)

Martin learned the day before the broadcast, during a rehearsal, that a TV camera would be live in the EMI Studio One control room to show Martin, Geoff Emerick, and Richard Lush operating the controls for the recording. Emerick recalled that Martin turned to the engineers and said, &quot;You two had better smarten yourselves up! You&#x27;re about to become international TV stars!&quot; During the 25 June simulcast, the Beatles&#x27; segment started broadcasting 40 seconds early, startling Martin and Emerick and forcing them to quickly hide a Scotch whisky supply they were using to calm their nerves. Worse, the production truck lost contact with the studio cameramen just before the segment started; this forced Martin to verbally relay the producer&#x27;s instructions to the camera crew live.

Despite these technical glitches, the Beatles, the orchestra, and the assembled crowd of Beatles friends recorded a seamless live take of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; to an audience in the hundreds of millions. After the broadcast, Lennon re-recorded part of his vocal and Starr added a tambourine overdub. The song was quickly released as a single with &quot;Baby You&#x27;re a Rich Man&quot; as a B-side, reaching no. 1 in numerous countries, including the US and UK. &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was the first Beatles single on which Martin received a written credit as producer.

====&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;====
Before &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; was even released, the Beatles held several sessions in April–June 1967 to record additional songs for a yet-to-be-determined purpose. These included &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, &quot;Baby You&#x27;re a Rich Man&quot;, &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)&quot;, and two songs later included on &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Martin later described many of these sessions as lacking the strong creative focus the band had displayed in recording &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Martin, showing less interest in these sessions, came uncharacteristically unprepared for the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; trumpet overdub session on 3 May, forcing the session musicians to improvise a score for themselves.
After taking most of the summer off, the Beatles and Martin recorded &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; at Chappell Studios in London on 23 August. Four days later, Brian Epstein died of an accidental drug overdose, devastating the band and Martin. McCartney urged the group to focus on the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; film project, and they resumed recording with Lennon&#x27;s &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;. For this song, which Martin initially disliked but grew to appreciate, he provided a quirky and original arrangement for brass, violins, cellos, and the Mike Sammes Singers vocal ensemble singing nonsense phrases. Martin, at Lennon&#x27;s request, also fed a live BBC radio recording of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; into the mixing desk for the song&#x27;s fadeout.

&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was released as an EP in the UK in December 1967 and an LP in the US in late November; it reached no. 2 and no. 1 on those charts, respectively. It was nominated for Grammy Album of the Year in 1969. McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, which featured orchestral overdubs scored and supervised by Martin, was issued as a single and reached no. 1 in both the US and UK.

===&quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and the White Album, 1967–1968===

====&quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; soundtrack====
In early 1967, Brian Epstein and media producer Al Brodax signed a contract to have the Beatles provide four original songs to support an animated feature film, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. The Beatles were initially contemptuous of the project, planning to relegate only their weakest songs to the soundtrack. The first song recorded for the film was George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Only a Northern Song&quot;, which was debuted during the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; sessions but rejected for inclusion by the other band members and Martin. The second was &quot;All Together Now&quot;, a children&#x27;s sing-along recorded without Martin&#x27;s involvement. The third was &quot;It&#x27;s All Too Much&quot;, also recorded without Martin in attendance. The final original song for the film, &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot;, was not recorded until February 1968.

Martin composed the film&#x27;s orchestral scores, which comprised the second half of the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. Martin composed these pieces while the Beatles retreated to India during the spring of 1968. Martin claimed to take inspiration for the score from Maurice Ravel, &quot;the musician I admire most&quot;.

The &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; film debuted on 17 July 1968 and was favourably received by critics. However, Martin chose to re-record the album&#x27;s score after the film&#x27;s release, delaying the soundtrack&#x27;s release until January 1969. &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; reached no. 2 in the US and no. 3 in the UK. Martin and three of the Beatles received a 1970 Grammy nomination for Best Sound Track Album.

====&quot;The Beatles&quot; (&quot;White Album&quot;)====
The Beatles gathered for a brief spate of sessions in February 1968 before their planned retreat to India with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. These sessions produced a no. 1 UK single, &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, backed by &quot;The Inner Light&quot;. While in India, the band members composed a large number of songs; they recorded these songs as demos at George Harrison&#x27;s Kinfauns home.

By the time of the White Album sessions in mid-1968, Martin found himself in competition with Apple Electronics&#x27;s eccentric inventor, &quot;Magic Alex&quot;, for the Beatles&#x27; interest in studio production. Other new personnel attending Beatles sessions were Lennon&#x27;s girlfriend, Yoko Ono, and Martin&#x27;s protégé, Chris Thomas. Engineer Geoff Emerick, frustrated by the Beatles&#x27; increasingly unpleasant demeanour at many of the sessions, quit partway through the album&#x27;s recording. Additionally, the Beatles began recording lengthy, repetitive rehearsal tracks in the studio. With all these disruptions to the band&#x27;s studio dynamic, Martin consciously stayed in the background of many sessions, reading stacks of newspapers in the control booth until his guidance or assistance was sought.

Parts of the White Album sessions required Martin and his engineers to attend to simultaneous recordings in different studios, such as an occasion when Lennon was working on the musique concrète &quot;Revolution 9&quot; in Studio Three, while McCartney recorded &quot;Blackbird&quot; in Studio Two. Though Lennon and Ono were responsible for most of the final mix on &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, Martin and Emerick applied a STEED delay effect to the track. Martin scored a fiddle arrangement on Ringo Starr&#x27;s first composition, &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot;. He also scored brass arrangements on &quot;Revolution 1&quot;, &quot;Honey Pie&quot;, &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot;, and &quot;Martha My Dear&quot;.

Martin played celesta on the album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Good Night&quot;, and conducted its orchestral arrangement. He also played harmonium on Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot;.

Martin recommended the Beatles choose the 14 best tracks from the sessions and issue a standard LP. The band overruled him, however, and chose to issue a double album. The sequencing and cross-fading of the album required a 24-hour session attended by Martin, Lennon, and McCartney. The album was released in late November to strong commercial and critical success, reaching no. 1 in the UK and US for eight and nine weeks, respectively.

The White Album sessions produced a no. 1 single, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, backed with &quot;Revolution&quot;. Martin scored a 36-piece orchestra for &quot;Hey Jude&quot;&#x27;s extended coda.

===&quot;Get Back&quot;/&quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, 1969–1970===

====&quot;Get Back&quot;/&quot;Let It Be&quot;====
In early January 1969, the Beatles gathered at Twickenham Film Studios to compose and record new material for a live album. The group sought a raw, unedited sound for the album, with Lennon telling Martin that he did not want any &quot;production shit&quot;. Filmmaker Michael Lindsay-Hogg directed a film crew to observe the Beatles&#x27; work sessions for use in a feature documentary film. The band&#x27;s working relationships faltered during these sessions, with Harrison quitting the group for several days out of frustration. (Martin later admitted he had contributed to Harrison&#x27;s status as a &quot;second-class&quot; Beatle.) Martin decided not to attend many of these tense, aimless sessions, leaving balance engineer Glyn Johns to act as &quot;de facto&quot; producer.

In mid-January, the Beatles relocated their work to the basement studio of Apple Records at 3 Savile Row, where their work ethic and mood improved. As Magic Alex had failed to deliver on a promised 72-track studio there, Martin called EMI to request two mobile four-track mixing desks and soundproofing equipment to enable a suitable recording environment. The band was soon joined by keyboard player Billy Preston, who attended the remaining sessions and contributed to the Beatles&#x27; new compositions. The Beatles and Preston performed on the roof of Apple Records on 30 January 1969, while Martin recorded the impromptu concert in the building&#x27;s basement studio. This concert performance—the Beatles&#x27; last—produced recordings of five new tracks, including a new single, &quot;Get Back&quot;. The next day, the band returned to the basement studio to record several more, including future singles &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;.

In March 1969, the Beatles rejected a proposed mix by Johns for a &quot;Get Back&quot; LP, scuttling hopes for a public release in the near term. The next month, they released &quot;Get Back&quot; as a single—though without a producer credit, as EMI was unable to determine whether Martin or Johns deserved the credit. &quot;Get Back&quot; reached no. 1 in the UK and US. In May, Martin and Johns worked together on another mix of &quot;Get Back&quot;—which the Beatles also rejected. Martin began at this time to consider that the Beatles might be finished as a commercial act. The Beatles rejected yet another Glyn Johns mix of the album in January 1970. Martin supervised the final Beatles recording session (without Lennon) on 3 January 1970, when the group recorded &quot;I Me Mine&quot;. In early March 1970, &quot;Let It Be&quot; was released and reached no. 1 in the US (and no. 2 in the UK).

In late March and early April 1970, Phil Spector remixed the album—now known as &quot;Let It Be&quot;—and added a series of orchestral and choral overdubs to several tracks. Martin (along with McCartney) was critical of these embellishments, calling them &quot;so uncharacteristic of the clean sounds the Beatles had always used&quot;. The album was finally released in May 1970, after McCartney had publicly announced he was leaving the Beatles. When EMI informed Martin that he would not get a production credit because Spector produced the final version, Martin commented, &quot;I produced the original, and what you should do is have a credit saying &#x27;Produced by George Martin, over-produced by Phil Spector&#x27;.&quot;

====&quot;Abbey Road&quot;====
The first song for what became the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album, &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot;, was recorded on 22 February 1969 at Trident Studios without Martin. However, the Beatles did not inform Martin they planned to record a new album until later in the spring when McCartney asked if Martin would produce it for them. &quot;Only if you let me produce it the way we used to&quot;, he replied; McCartney agreed. Lennon and McCartney also persuaded Geoff Emerick to rejoin their sessions as balance engineer, beginning with a recording of the single &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; in mid-April; the single, backed with &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot;, reached no. 1 in the UK after its 30 May release.

Martin&#x27;s first album session came on 5 May, when he supervised overdubs to Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Something&quot;. Martin soon set to help the Beatles develop the second side of the album into a &quot;medley&quot; of songs, akin to a rock opera. Martin guided the band using his knowledge of classical music to conceive a fluid, cohesive series of songs with repeating themes and motifs. Sessions recommenced in July and continued into August. Martin played an electric harpsichord accompaniment to &quot;Because&quot;. He also composed and orchestrated orchestral arrangements for four of the album&#x27;s songs.

&quot;Abbey Road&quot; was released on 26 September 1969, topping the charts in both the US and Britain. The following year, Martin was nominated as its producer for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Martin took particular pride in the symphonic medley on side two, claiming later, &quot;There&#x27;s far more of me on &quot;Abbey Road&quot; than on any of their other albums&quot;. The album&#x27;s double A-sided single, &quot;Something&quot;/&quot;Come Together&quot;, reached no. 1 in the US.

===Post-breakup Beatles work===

====Beatle solo records====
Martin produced the first solo album by a member of the Beatles after John Lennon had privately announced he was leaving the group—Ringo Starr&#x27;s March 1970 standards album, &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;.

Martin next worked with Paul McCartney to score orchestral arrangements on three songs for the 1971 album &quot;Ram&quot;. Martin then paired with McCartney and his band, Wings to produce the &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; theme song for the 1973 James Bond film of the same name. Martin arranged the orchestral production for the song, which reached no. 2 in the US singles chart. Martin&#x27;s work on the song earned him the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) at the 16th Annual Grammy Awards in 1974.

Martin and McCartney reunited in late 1980 to record &quot;We All Stand Together&quot;, a song for a Rupert Bear animated short film, &quot;Rupert and the Frog Song&quot;. The song was released as a single in 1984, reaching no. 3 in the UK chart. The late 1980 sessions continued into the end of 1981 in AIR&#x27;s studios in Montserrat and London, producing what became McCartney&#x27;s 1982 &quot;Tug of War&quot;. Ringo Starr contributed drums to the top-10 US single &quot;Take It Away&quot;. &quot;Tug of War&quot; was met with critical acclaim and topped both the US and UK album charts; the album&#x27;s most successful single was &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot;, a McCartney duet with Stevie Wonder that also reached no. 1 in the UK and US. &quot;Tug of War&quot; and two of its tracks were nominated for a total of five Grammys.

McCartney and Martin used leftover material from &quot;Tug of War&quot; to start a new album, &quot;Pipes of Peace&quot;, which was released in 1983. The lead single, &quot;Say Say Say&quot;, was a duet between McCartney and Michael Jackson that reached no. 1 in the US and no. 2 in the UK. Martin scored a horn arrangement for the song. The album&#x27;s second single, the title track, reached no. 1 in the UK. &quot;Pipes of Peace&quot; did not receive the high acclaim of &quot;Tug of War&quot;, though it reached no. 4 on the UK album charts.

Martin produced the soundtrack album to McCartney&#x27;s 1984 film, &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot;. Though the film was poorly received, the soundtrack reached no. 1 in the UK and was supported by a UK no. 2 single, &quot;No More Lonely Nights&quot;. The soundtrack also featured numerous reinterpretations of McCartney Beatles classics.

Martin mixed McCartney&#x27;s 1987 no. 10 UK single, &quot;Once Upon a Long Ago&quot;. He recorded orchestral overdubs for McCartney&#x27;s 1990 &quot;Put It There&quot; and 1993 &quot;C&#x27;Mon People&quot; singles. He provided additional orchestration on several tracks on McCartney&#x27;s 1997 album, &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;, and co-produced the song &quot;Calico Skies&quot;.

In 1998, at Yoko Ono&#x27;s request, Martin scored an orchestral arrangement to the 1980 John Lennon demo of &quot;Grow Old with Me&quot;, which appeared in the &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot;. Martin&#x27;s son, Giles, played bass.

====&quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;====
Martin oversaw post-production on &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; (which was originally entitled &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;) in 1994 and 1995, working again with Geoff Emerick. Martin decided to use an old 8-track analogue mixing console – which EMI learned an engineer still had – to mix the songs for the project, instead of a modern digital console. He explained this by saying that the old console created a completely different sound, which a new console could not accurately reproduce. He said he found the whole project a strange experience, as they had to listen to themselves chatting in the studio, 25–30 years previously. Martin also contributed extensive interviews to the &quot;Anthology&quot; documentary series. All three of the &quot;Anthology&quot; double-album releases reached no. 1 in the US.

Martin was not involved in producing the two new singles reuniting McCartney, Harrison, and Starr, who wanted to overdub two old Lennon demos provided by Yoko Ono—&quot;Free as a Bird&quot; and &quot;Real Love&quot;. Though Martin&#x27;s hearing loss was cited publicly as the rationale, he was not asked by the band members to produce the tracks; Jeff Lynne performed these duties instead.

====Cirque du Soleil and &quot;Love&quot;====
In 2006, Martin and his son, Giles Martin, remixed 80 minutes of Beatles music for the Las Vegas stage performance &quot;Love&quot;, a joint venture between Cirque du Soleil and the Beatles&#x27; Apple Corps Ltd. A soundtrack album from the show was released that same year. As part of his contribution to the soundtrack album, Martin orchestrated a score for a demo version of &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;; the orchestra session, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Hall, was his final orchestral production. &quot;Love&quot; reached no. 3 in the UK charts and no. 4 in the US. Martin received the 2008 Grammy Awards for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album and Best Surround Sound Album.

===&quot;Fifth Beatle&quot; status===
Martin&#x27;s contribution to the Beatles&#x27; work received regular critical acclaim, and led to him being described as the &quot;fifth Beatle&quot;. In 2016, McCartney wrote that &quot;If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George&quot;. According to Alan Parsons, he had &quot;great ears&quot; and &quot;rightfully earned the title of &quot;fifth Beatle&quot;. Julian Lennon called Martin &quot;the fifth Beatle, without question&quot;.

In the immediate aftermath of the Beatles&#x27; break-up, a time when he made many angry utterances, John Lennon trivialised Martin&#x27;s importance to the Beatles&#x27; music. In his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, Lennon said, &quot;[Dick James] is another one of those people, who think they made us. They didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d like to hear Dick James&#x27; music and I&#x27;d like to hear George Martin&#x27;s music, please, just play me some.&quot; Martin rebutted Lennon&#x27;s comments in an interview in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. In a 1971 letter to Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, &quot;When people ask me questions about &#x27;What did George Martin really do for you?,&#x27; I have only one answer, &#x27;What does he do now?&#x27; I noticed you had no answer for that! It&#x27;s not a putdown, it&#x27;s the truth.&quot; Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles&#x27; music. Commenting specifically on &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, Lennon said, &quot;For Martin to state that he was &#x27;painting a sound picture&#x27; is pure hallucination. Ask any of the other people involved. The final editing Yoko and I did alone.&quot;

In contrast, in 1971 Lennon said, &quot;George Martin made us what we were in the studio. He helped us develop a language to talk to other musicians.&quot;

==Other artists==
===Independent production work, 1965–1980s===
Martin&#x27;s early work under his new Associated Independent Recording (AIR) banner included Cilla Black&#x27;s rendition of Burt Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;Alfie&quot;, which made no. 6 in the UK, and musical scores for Lionel Bart&#x27;s much-maligned &quot;Twang!!&quot; theatrical production. Another early AIR act was the Action, whom Martin had produced earlier through Parlophone. AIR&#x27;s first official outside signing was David and Jonathan, who scored a no. 7 UK hit with &quot;Lovers of the World Unite&quot; in 1966. Martin also reunited with other artists from his Parlophone days, such as Matt Monro, Rolf Harris, and Ron Goodwin, though these reunions often failed to produce the same success as earlier records had.

Martin also continued to produce novelty music acts, such as the Scaffold, the comedy rock group featuring Paul McCartney&#x27;s brother, Mike McGear. In November 1967, they released their first top-10 hit, &quot;Thank U Very Much&quot;—though it was also the last Scaffold record produced by Martin. Martin also recorded the Master Singers, whose &quot;Highway Code&quot; single became a minor hit in April 1966.

In October 1970, Martin and his AIR partners opened their first company studio at the top of the Peter Robinson building in Oxford Circus, London.

In 1977, Martin expressed interest in producing Billy Joel&#x27;s next album, which would become &quot;The Stranger&quot;. Joel, a huge fan of The Beatles and an admirer of Martin&#x27;s work, was adamant that he wanted to use his touring band on the album, while Martin was insistent on using session musicians. This disagreement caused Joel to go with Phil Ramone instead of Martin as producer for the album.

Additional artists that Martin worked with include singers Celine Dion, Kenny Rogers, Yoshiki of X Japan, Gary Brooker, Neil Sedaka, and the a cappella vocal ensemble the King&#x27;s Singers; guitarists Jeff Beck, John McLaughlin, and John Williams; 1960s duo Edwards Hand; and the bands Seatrain, Ultravox, UFO, Cheap Trick, and Little River Band. Martin produced seven albums for America, which included the hits &quot;Tin Man&quot; (on which he played piano), &quot;Lonely People,&quot; and &quot;Sister Golden Hair.&quot; As the band&#x27;s Gerry Beckley said in a 2017 interview, &quot;He was really great at keeping us focused and moving forward.&quot;

He also produced the album &quot;The Man in the Bowler Hat&quot; (1974) for the eccentric British folk-rock group Stackridge. Martin worked with Paul Winter on his (1972) &quot;Icarus&quot; album, which was recorded in a rented house by the sea in Marblehead, Massachusetts. Winter said that Martin taught him &quot;how to use the studio as a tool&quot;, and allowed him to record the album in a relaxed atmosphere, which was different from the pressurised control in a professional studio. In 1979 he worked with Ron Goodwin to produce the album containing &quot;The Beatles Concerto&quot;, written by John Rutter.

In 1988, Martin produced an album version of the play &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, with music by Martin, Elton John, and Mark Knopfler; Anthony Hopkins played the part of &quot;First Voice&quot;.

In 1979, Martin opened AIR Montserrat, a studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. This studio was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo ten years later.

===Later work, 1990s–2010===
In 1991, Martin contributed the string arrangement and conducted the orchestra for the song &quot;Ticket to Heaven&quot; on the last Dire Straits studio album, &quot;On Every Street&quot;. In 1992, Martin worked with Pete Townshend on the musical stage production of &quot;The Who&#x27;s Tommy&quot;. The play opened on Broadway in 1993, with the original cast album being released that summer. Martin won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album in 1993, as the producer of that album.

In 1995, he contributed the horn and string arrangement for the song &quot;Latitude&quot; on the Elton John &quot;Made in England&quot; album, which was recorded at Martin&#x27;s AIR Studios London. He also produced &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;, Elton&#x27;s tribute single to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, which topped charts around the world in September 1997 and became the best-selling British single of all time. It was also Martin&#x27;s final production of a single.

On 15 September 1997, Martin arranged a benefit concert for the island of Montserrat, which had been devastated by volcanic activity. The event, &quot;Music for Montserrat&quot;, featured Paul McCartney, Elton John, Sting, Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Buffett, and Carl Perkins.

Martin served as a consultant to the June 2002 Party at the Palace at Buckingham Palace Garden for the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee.

In 2010, Martin was the executive producer of the hard rock debut of Arms of the Sun, an all-star project featuring Rex Brown (Pantera, Down), John Luke Hebert (King Diamond), Lance Harvill and Ben Bunker.

==Film and composing work==
Beginning in the late 1950s, Martin began to supplement his producer income by publishing music and having his artists record it. He used the pseudonyms Lezlo Anales and John Chisholm, before settling on Graham Fisher as his primary pseudonym. His earliest composing work was incidental music to accompany Peter Sellers&#x27;s comedy records. His film work was aided by his secretary and second wife, Judy, whose father was chairman of the Film Producers Guild. In 1966, he signed a long-term deal with United Artists to write instrumental music.

Martin composed, arranged, and produced film scores beginning in the early 1960s, including the instrumental scores of the films &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964, for which he won an Academy Award Nomination), &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; (1965), &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; (1968), and &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973). Other notable movie scores include &quot;Crooks Anonymous&quot; (1962), &quot;The Family Way&quot; (1966), &quot;Pulp&quot; (1972, starring Michael Caine and Mickey Rooney), the Peter Sellers film &quot;The Optimists of Nine Elms&quot; (1973), and the John Schlesinger-directed &quot;Honky Tonk Freeway&quot; (1981).

Martin was also commissioned to write an official opening theme for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s launch in September 1967. Entitled &quot;Theme One&quot;, it was the first music heard on Radio 1 (not The Move&#x27;s &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot;, which was the first record played in full on the station). The tune was later covered by the British progressive rock group Van der Graaf Generator.

In November 2017, the Craig Leon-produced album &quot;George Martin – Film Scores and Original Orchestral Music&quot; was released. The album of new recordings collected a selection of Martin&#x27;s compositions together for the first time, including previously unheard pieces &quot;Belle Etoile&quot; and sketches from the feature film &quot;The Mission&quot; (1986) which were not used in the original soundtrack.

===Music from the James Bond series===
Martin directly and indirectly contributed to the main themes of three films in the James Bond series. Although Martin did not produce the theme for the second Bond film, &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, he was responsible for the signing of Matt Monro to EMI, just months prior to his recording of the song of the same title.
Martin also produced two of the best-known James Bond themes. The first was &quot;Goldfinger&quot; by Shirley Bassey in 1964. The second, in 1973, was &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; by Paul McCartney and Wings for the film of the same name. He also composed and produced the film&#x27;s score.

==Books and audio retrospective==
In 1979, Martin published a memoir, &quot;All You Need Is Ears&quot; (co-written with Jeremy Hornsby), that described his work with the Beatles and other artists (including Peter Sellers, Sophia Loren, Shirley Bassey, Flanders and Swann, Matt Monro, and Dudley Moore), and gave an informal introduction to the art and science of sound recording. In 1993, he published &quot;Summer of Love: The Making of Sgt Pepper&quot; (published in the U.S. as &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends: The Making of Sgt Pepper&quot;, co-authored with William Pearson), which also included interview quotations from a 1992 &quot;South Bank Show&quot; episode discussing the album. Martin also edited a 1983 book called &quot;Making Music: The Guide to Writing, Performing and Recording&quot;.

In 2001, Martin released &quot;Produced by George Martin: 50 Years in Recording&quot;, a six-CD retrospective of his entire studio career, and in 2002, Martin launched &quot;Playback&quot;, his limited-edition illustrated autobiography, published by Genesis Publications.

==Television==

===&quot;The Rhythm of Life&quot;===
In 1997–98, Martin hosted a three-part BBC co-produced documentary series titled &quot;The Rhythm of Life&quot;, in which he discussed various aspects of musical composition with professional musicians and singers, among them Brian Wilson, Billy Joel, and Celine Dion. The series aired on the Ovation television network in the United States.

===&quot;Produced by George Martin&quot;===
On 25 April 2011, a 90-minute documentary feature film co-produced by the BBC &quot;Arena&quot; team, &quot;Produced by George Martin&quot;, aired to critical acclaim for the first time in the UK. It combines rare archive footage and new interviews with, among others, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Jeff Beck, Cilla Black, and Giles Martin, and tells the life story of how Martin, a schoolboy growing up in the Depression, grew up to become a legendary music producer. The film, with over 50 minutes of extra footage, including interviews from Rick Rubin, T-Bone Burnett and Ken Scott, was released worldwide by Eagle Rock Entertainment on DVD and Blu-ray on 10 September 2012. Mark Lewisohn curated an accompanying six-volume musical box set.

===&quot;Soundbreaking: Stories from the Cutting Edge of Recorded Music&quot;===
Produced in association with Sir George Martin, &quot;Soundbreaking: Stories from the Cutting Edge of Recorded Music&quot; charts a century&#x27;s worth of music innovation and experimentation, and offers a behind-the-scenes look at recorded music. &quot;Soundbreaking&quot; features more than 160 original interviews with some of the most celebrated recording artists, producers, and music industry pioneers of all time. &quot;Soundbreaking&quot; became Martin&#x27;s last, and one of his most personal, projects when he died six days before its premiere.

==Personal life==
In 1946, Martin met Jean (&quot;Sheena&quot;) Chisholm, a fellow member of the Royal Navy&#x27;s choir. They bonded over their mutual love of music. Martin&#x27;s mother, Bertha, strongly disapproved of Chisholm as a partner for Martin, causing early strain in the relationship. Against Bertha&#x27;s wishes, Martin and Chisholm married at the University of Aberdeen on 3 January 1948. Bertha died three weeks later of a brain haemorrhage, and Martin felt responsible for his mother&#x27;s death. They had two children, Alexis (born 1953) and Gregory Paul Martin (born 1957). Around 1955, the Martins moved from London and bought a home in the development town of Hatfield, Hertfordshire some 20 miles north. By the early 1960s, Martin sought divorce, but Chisholm refused, citing her childcare needs. By this time, Martin had also moved out of Hatfield and rented a small flat in central London, which he shared with his widowed father for a time. Their divorce was finalized in February 1965.

Martin met Judy Lockhart Smith on his first day of work at EMI Studios in 1950, when she served as secretary to Parlophone director Oscar Preuss. Martin chose to retain her as a secretary when he assumed the direction of Parlophone in 1955, and they commuted together from Hatfield each day. Martin and Lockhart Smith began a discreet affair in the late 1950s. They married on 24 June 1966 at the Marylebone Registry Office. They had two children, Lucie (born 1967) and Giles Martin (born 1969).

In the mid-1970s, Martin&#x27;s hearing started to decline; in an interview with the Institute of Professional Sound, he stated that he first noticed it when realizing that he couldn&#x27;t detect high frequencies that an engineer was using to evaluate tonality. Giles consequently served as an impromptu assistant and helped George hide the condition as it worsened over the next two decades. Martin attributed his hearing loss to his constant production work, stating that &quot;I was in the studio for 14 hours at a stretch, and never let my ears repair. There&#x27;s no question that listening to loud music was a major contribution to my hearing loss.&quot; By 2014, he relied on a combination of hearing aids and lip-reading to communicate face-to-face.

Martin spent his later years with Lockhart Smith at their home in Coleshill, Oxfordshire.

==Death==
Martin died on 8 March 2016 at his home in Coleshill, at age 90. His death was announced by Ringo Starr on his Twitter account, and a spokesperson for Universal Music Group confirmed his death. The cause of his death was not immediately disclosed, but his biographer, Kenneth Womack, later wrote that the cause of death had been complications associated with stomach cancer. His funeral was held on 14 March at All Saints Church in Coleshill, and he was buried near the church. A memorial service was held on 11 May at St Martin-in-the-Fields, attended by, among others, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, Olivia Harrison, Elton John, Bernard Cribbins, and former colleagues.

==Coat of arms==

Sir George was granted a coat of arms in 2004, with the Latin motto &quot;Amore Solum Opus Est&quot; which translates to &quot;All you need is love.&quot; The arms are a prime example of canting arms, creating arms with a visual pun, including Martin, a recorder, beetles, and a badge (not shown) of a zebra holding an abbot&#x27;s crozier, representing both Abbey Road Studios and the Beatles&#x27; album, with its iconic cover featuring a zebra crossing.

<text>The Apple IIe Card is a compatibility card, which through hardware and software emulation, allows certain Macintosh computers to run software designed for the Apple II (excluding the 16-bit II). Released in March 1991 for use with the LC family, Apple targeted the card at its widely dominated educational market to ease the transition from Apple II-based classrooms, with thousands of entrenched educational software titles, to Macintosh-based classrooms.

== Overview == 
Well into the 1990s, most schools still had a substantial investment in Apple II computers and software in their classrooms and labs. However, by that period Apple was looking to phase out the Apple II line, and so introduced the Apple IIe Card as a means to transition Apple II educators (and to a smaller degree, home and small business users) by migrating them over to the Macintosh. By adding the card to certain 68K-based Macintosh computers, it provides backwards compatibility with the vast Apple II software library of over 10,000 titles. Software can be run directly from an Apple II floppy diskette, the same way as with an Apple IIe (made possible via the card&#x27;s cable-adapter that connects a standard Apple 5.25 Drive). A similar &quot;Apple IIGS Card&quot; was planned for running 16-bit Apple IIGS software, but was canceled after being deemed too costly, therefore leaving no migration path for that segment of the Apple II line.

Apple asked the media to call the peripheral the &quot;Apple IIe option board&quot;, as earlier &quot;emulator&quot; cards were not successful. The Apple IIe Card works in the Macintosh LC series (I, II, III, III+, 475, 520, 550, 575), as well as the LC-slot compatible Color Classic (I and II). When running in Apple II emulation mode, the card uses Macintosh peripherals as Apple II devices. The mouse, keyboard, internal speaker, clock, serial ports (printer, modem, networking), extra RAM (up to 1024 KB), internal 3.5 floppy drive, and hard disk all function as Apple II devices. With the included Y-cable, Apple II specific peripherals can be used as well: The Apple 5.25, Apple UniDisk 3.5, and an Apple II joystick or paddles. The host Macintosh requires special emulation software (a boot disk) launched from System 6.0.8 to 7.5.5 in order to activate the IIe Card. Apple II mode runs only in full-screen (a windowed mode is not possible) and all Macintosh operations are suspended while running, as the IIe card takes over the host computer.

== Technical aspects ==
Like the Apple IIe itself, the Apple IIe Card uses an onboard 65C02 CPU. The CPU is software-configurable to run at the Apple IIe&#x27;s native 1.0 MHz speed or at an accelerated 1.9 MHz. Video emulation (text and graphics) is handled through software using native Macintosh QuickDraw routines, which often results in operations being slower than a real Apple IIe except on higher-end machines. Any Macintosh that supports the card can be switched into 560×384 resolution for better compatibility with the IIe&#x27;s 280×192 color High-Resolution graphics (essentially doubled in both directions on the Macintosh) and 560x192 monochrome Double-High-Res (doubled vertically), using the card&#x27;s onboard 17.2349 MHz oscillator in place of the usual video clock thanks to the local bus nature of the PDS slot. This was particularly applicable to the Color Classic which is otherwise fixed at 512×384 resolution; the monitor scan rate remains the same, but horizontal pixel density (and total pixel clocks per scanline) is increased by 10% to fit the greater resolution in the same width.

The IIe card has 256K RAM; half is used to emulate the Apple IIe&#x27;s standard 128K memory (reproducing its 64K main RAM plus the 64K bank-switched Extended 80-Column Text Card), and a small portition of the other half stores the IIe&#x27;s ROM. &quot;Macworld&quot; reported that because Apple IIGS engineers helped design the IIe Card, all copy-protected and other software except for &quot;a few very esoteric games&quot; are compatible. The host Macintosh emulates or provides native access to many of the expansion cards and peripherals one might install in a bare Apple IIe. These services provided to the IIe card makes the simultaneous running of the host&#x27;s System 7 impossible. Hardware services include a 1.44 MB 3.5&quot; SuperDrive, mouse, 1 MB RAM, 80-column text and graphical monochrome or color display, clock, numeric keypad, two hardware serial ports (in addition to the emulated serial port necessary for the IIe mouse), SCSI hard drive, and AppleShare file server. An included &quot;Y-cable&quot; enables the attachment of up to two external 140 KB floppy disk 5.25&quot; Drives, an 800 KB &quot;intelligent&quot; 3.5&quot; UniDisk drive, and an Apple II joystick or paddle control for use in Apple IIe emulation mode. 800 KB 3.5&quot; Drive and 1.44 MB SuperDrives are not supported nor function if attached directly via the Y-cable due to the Disk Controller on the IIe card lacking compatibility. (chip labeled U1A located in zone A1 of card – lower left as pictured above)

The product included the PDS card, Y-cable, owner&#x27;s manual and two 3.5&quot; floppy disks: the &#x27;Apple IIe installer disk&#x27; and the &#x27;Apple IIe card startup disk&#x27;. Version 2.2.2d1 is the final revision of the startup disk. Version 2.2.1 and a patch to reach 2.2.2d1 was originally available at Apple Support Area (this software now archived and moved off site, as is the case with the original manual).

==Reception==
Apple stated that the LC helped the company regain educational market share lost to inexpensive PC clones. , about half of the LCs sold to schools used the IIe Card.

== Technical specifications ==
* LSI Logic Gemini chip (similar to Mega II); a nearly complete Apple IIe on a single microcircuit – minus RAM, firmware, CPU and video generation
* IWM (Integrated Woz Machine) for floppy control functions
* 256 KB RAM built-in (128 KB for Apple II memory, 128 KB reserved for Macintosh)
* 65C02 processor running at either 1.023 MHz or 1.9 MHz
* High-density 26-pin connector with &quot;Y-cable&quot; supports joystick/paddles and two Apple 5.25&quot; or UniDisk 3.5&quot; floppy disk drives
* Ability to access up to 1 MB of native Macintosh RAM
* All Apple IIe text and video modes supported, via QuickDraw software emulation

Notes: When emulating the Apple IIe, only a full-screen mode is available and all native Macintosh functions are suspended while running (a proprietary graphical control panel, running outside MacOS, is available for configuring the virtual Apple II slots and peripherals; however, both native and emulated computer function are suspended during this activity). Macintosh functions and control resume only once emulation is completely shut down and exited.

== Host system compatibility ==
The card plugs into the PDS slot in many of the LC-series Macintoshes, but not all models and system software combinations are supported. Apple&#x27;s Tech Info Library article #8458 lists the following models as Apple IIe Card-compatible: Color Classic, Colour Classic II, LC, LC II, III &amp; III+; LC 475, 520, 550, 575; Quadra 605 and Performa 4XX, 52X, 55X, 56X, and 57X. However, other 68K models that have an LC-compatible PDS slot &quot;and&quot; support 24-bit memory addressing are generally compatible with the Apple IIe Card but are not officially supported. The host Macintosh requires Apple&#x27;s emulation software (a boot disk) launched from System 6.0.8 to 7.5.5 in order to activate the IIe Card. Systems 7.0 through 7.5.5 support both 24- and 32-bit addressing on suitable Macintosh models (from System 7.6 onwards, Macintosh system software does not support the required 24-bit addressing). 24-bit addressing can be enabled on supported systems with the Macintosh Memory control panel. The Apple IIe Card will not work with 32-bit addressing enabled or Macintosh System Software or machines locked to this mode.

Contrary to some sources, the LC 630 and Quadra 630 are not compatible with the Apple IIe card because those computers do not support 24-bit mode.

<doc id="77182" wikidata="Q179742" url="?curid=77182" title="Prejudice">
<text>Prejudice can be an affective feeling towards a person based on their perceived social group membership. The word is often used to refer to a preconceived (usually unfavourable) evaluation or classification of another person based on that person&#x27;s perceived personal characteristics, such as political affiliation, sex, gender, gender identity, beliefs, values, social class, friendship, age, disability, religion, sexuality, race, ethnicity, language, nationality, culture, complexion, beauty, height, body weight, occupation, wealth, education, criminality, sport-team affiliation, music tastes or other perceived characteristics.

The word &quot;prejudice&quot; can also refer to unfounded or pigeonholed beliefs and it may apply to &quot;any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence&quot;. Gordon Allport defined prejudice as a &quot;feeling, favorable or unfavorable, toward a person or thing, prior to, or not based on, actual experience&quot;. Auestad (2015) defines prejudice as characterized by &quot;symbolic transfer&quot;, transfer of a value-laden meaning content onto a socially-formed category and then on to individuals who are taken to belong to that category, resistance to change, and overgeneralization.

The United Nations Institute on Globalization, Culture and Mobility has highlighted research considering prejudice as a global security threat due to its use in scapegoating some populations and inciting others to commit violent acts towards them and how this can endanger individuals, countries, and the international community.

==Etymology==

The word prejudice has been used since Middle English around the year 1300. It comes from the Old French word préjudice, which comes from Latin praeiūdicium which comes from prae (before) and iūdicium (judgment).

==Historical approaches==
The first psychological research conducted on prejudice occurred in the 1920s. This research attempted to prove white supremacy. One article from 1925 which reviewed 73 studies on race concluded that the studies seemed &quot;to indicate the mental superiority of the white race&quot;. These studies, along with other research, led many psychologists to view prejudice as a natural response to races believed to be inferior.

In the 1930s and 1940s, this perspective began to change due to the increasing concern about anti-Semitism due to the ideology of the Nazis. At the time, theorists viewed prejudice as pathological and they thus looked for personality syndromes linked with racism. Theodor Adorno believed that prejudice stemmed from an authoritarian personality; he believed that people with authoritarian personalities were the most likely to be prejudiced against groups of lower status. He described authoritarians as &quot;rigid thinkers who obeyed authority, saw the world as black and white, and enforced strict adherence to social rules and hierarchies&quot;.

In 1954, Gordon Allport, in his classic work &quot;The Nature of Prejudice&quot;, linked prejudice to categorical thinking. Allport claimed that prejudice is a natural and normal process for humans. According to him, &quot;The human mind must think with the aid of categories... Once formed, categories are the basis for normal prejudgment. We cannot possibly avoid this process. Orderly living depends upon it.&quot; In his book, he emphasizes the importance of the contact hypothesis. This theory posits that contact between different (ethnic) groups can reduce prejudices against those groups. Allport acknowledges the importance of the circumstances in which such contact occurs. He has attached conditions to it to promote positive contact and reduce prejudices.

In the 1970s, research began to show that prejudice tends to be based on favoritism towards one&#x27;s own groups, rather than negative feelings towards another group. According to Marilyn Brewer, prejudice &quot;may develop not because outgroups are hated, but because positive emotions such as admiration, sympathy, and trust are reserved for the ingroup&quot;.

In 1979, Thomas Pettigrew described the ultimate attribution error and its role in prejudice. The ultimate attribution error occurs when ingroup members &quot;(1) attribute negative outgroup behavior to dispositional causes (more than they would for identical ingroup behavior), and (2) attribute positive outgroup behavior to one or more of the following causes: (a) a fluke or exceptional case, (b) luck or special advantage, (c) high motivation and effort, and (d) situational factors&quot;/

Young-Bruehl (1996) argued that prejudice cannot be treated in the singular; one should rather speak of different prejudices as characteristic of different character types. Her theory defines prejudices as being social defences, distinguishing between an obsessional character structure, primarily linked with anti-semitism, hysterical characters, primarily associated with racism, and narcissistic characters, linked with sexism.

==Contemporary theories and empirical findings==

The out-group homogeneity effect is the perception that members of an out-group are more similar (homogenous) than members of the in-group. Social psychologists Quattrone and Jones conducted a study demonstrating this with students from the rival schools Princeton University and Rutgers University. Students at each school were shown videos of other students from each school choosing a type of music to listen to for an auditory perception study. Then the participants were asked to guess what percentage of the videotaped students&#x27; classmates would choose the same. Participants predicted a much greater similarity between out-group members (the rival school) than between members of their in-group.

The justification-suppression model of prejudice was created by Christian Crandall and Amy Eshleman. This model explains that people face a conflict between the desire to express prejudice and the desire to maintain a positive self-concept. This conflict causes people to search for justification for disliking an out-group, and to use that justification to avoid negative feelings (cognitive dissonance) about themselves when they act on their dislike of the out-group.

The realistic conflict theory states that competition between limited resources leads to increased negative prejudices and discrimination. This can be seen even when the resource is insignificant. In the Robber&#x27;s Cave experiment, negative prejudice and hostility was created between two summer camps after sports competitions for small prizes. The hostility was lessened after the two competing camps were forced to cooperate on tasks to achieve a common goal.

Another contemporary theory is the integrated threat theory (ITT), which was developed by Walter G Stephan. It draws from and builds upon several other psychological explanations of prejudice and ingroup/outgroup behaviour, such as the realistic conflict theory and symbolic racism. It also uses the social identity theory perspective as the basis for its validity; that is, it assumes that individuals operate in a group-based context where group memberships form a part of individual identity. ITT posits that outgroup prejudice and discrimination is caused when individuals perceive an outgroup to be threatening in some way. ITT defines four threats: 
* Realistic threats
* Symbolic threats
* Intergroup anxiety
* Negative stereotypes

Realistic threats are tangible, such as competition for a natural resource or a threat to income. Symbolic threats arise from a perceived difference in cultural values between groups or a perceived imbalance of power (for example, an ingroup perceiving an outgroup&#x27;s religion as incompatible with theirs). Intergroup anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness experienced in the presence of an outgroup or outgroup member, which constitutes a threat because interactions with other groups cause negative feelings (e.g., a threat to comfortable interactions). Negative stereotypes are similarly threats, in that individuals anticipate negative behaviour from outgroup members in line with the perceived stereotype (for example, that the outgroup is violent). Often these stereotypes are associated with emotions such as fear and anger. ITT differs from other threat theories by including intergroup anxiety and negative stereotypes as threat types.

Additionally, social dominance theory states that society can be viewed as group-based hierarchies. In competition for scarce resources such as housing or employment, dominant groups create prejudiced &quot;legitimizing myths&quot; to provide moral and intellectual justification for their dominant position over other groups and validate their claim over the limited resources. Legitimizing myths, such as discriminatory hiring practices or biased merit norms, work to maintain these prejudiced hierarchies.

Prejudice can be a central contributing factor to depression. This can occur in someone who is a prejudice victim, being the target of someone else&#x27;s prejudice, or when people have prejudice against themselves that causes their own depression.

Paul Bloom argues that while prejudice can be irrational and have terrible consequences, it is natural and often quite rational. This is because prejudices are based on the human tendency to categorise objects and people based on prior experience. This means people make predictions about things in a category based on prior experience with that category, with the resulting predictions usually being accurate (though not always). Bloom argues that this process of categorisation and prediction is necessary for survival and normal interaction, quoting William Hazlitt, who stated &quot;Without the aid of prejudice and custom, I should not be able to find my way my across the room; nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances, nor what to feel in any relation of life&quot;.

In recent years, researchers have argued that the study of prejudice has been traditionally too narrow. It is argued that since prejudice is defined as a negative affect towards members of a group, there are many groups against whom prejudice is acceptable (such as rapists, men who abandon their families, pedophiles, neo-Nazis, drink-drivers, queue jumpers, murderers etc.), yet such prejudices are not studied. It has been suggested that researchers have focused too much on an evaluative approach to prejudice, rather than a descriptive approach, which looks at the actual psychological mechanisms behind prejudiced attitudes. It is argued that this limits research to targets of prejudice to groups deemed to be receiving unjust treatment, while groups researchers deem treated justly or deservedly of prejudice are overlooked. As a result, the scope of prejudice has begun to expand in research, allowing a more accurate analysis of the relationship between psychological traits and prejudice. 

Some researchers had advocated looking into understanding prejudice from the perspective of collective values than just as biased psychological mechanism and different conceptions of prejudice, including what lay people think constitutes prejudice. This is due to concerns that the way prejudice has been operationalised does not fit its psychological definition and that it is often used to indicate a belief is faulty or unjustified without actually proving this to be the case.

Some research has connected dark triad personality traits (Machiavellianism, grandiose narcissism, and psychopathy) with being more likely to hold racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, and transphobic views.

=== Evolutionary psychology ===
===Problems with psychological models===
One problem with the notion that prejudice evolved because of a necessity to simplify social classifications because of limited brain capacity and at the same time can be mitigated through education is that the two contradict each other, the combination amounting to saying that the problem is a shortage of hardware and at the same time can be mitigated by stuffing even more software into the hardware one just said was overloaded with too much software. The distinction between men&#x27;s hostility to outgroup men being based on dominance and aggression and women&#x27;s hostility to outgroup men being based on fear of sexual coercion is criticized with reference to the historical example that Hitler and other male Nazis believed that intergroup sex was worse than murder and would destroy them permanently which they did not believe that war itself would, i.e. a view of outgroup male threat that evolutionary psychology considers to be a female view and not a male view.

==Types of prejudice==
One can be prejudiced against or have a preconceived notion about someone due to any characteristic they find to be unusual or undesirable. A few commonplace examples of prejudice are those based on someone&#x27;s race, gender, nationality, social status, sexual orientation, or religious affiliation, and controversies may arise from any given topic.

===Gender identity===

Transgender and non-binary people can be discriminated against because they identify with a gender that does not align with their assigned sex at birth. Refusal to call them by their preferred pronouns, or claims that they are not the gender they identify as, could be considered discrimination, especially if the victim of this discrimination has expressed repetitively what their preferred identity is. 

Gender identity is now considered a protected category of discrimination. Therefore, severe cases of this discrimination can lead to criminal penalty or prosecution in some countries, and workplaces are required to protect against discrimination based on gender identity. 

====Sexism====
===Nationalism===

Nationalism is a sentiment based on common cultural characteristics that binds a population and often produces a policy of national independence or separatism. It suggests a &quot;shared identity&quot; amongst a nation&#x27;s people that minimizes differences within the group and emphasizes perceived boundaries between the group and non-members. This leads to the assumption that members of the nation have more in common than they actually do, that they are &quot;culturally unified&quot;, even if injustices within the nation based on differences like status and race exist. During times of conflict between one nation and another, nationalism is controversial since it may function as a buffer for criticism when it comes to the nation&#x27;s own problems since it makes the nation&#x27;s own hierarchies and internal conflicts appear to be natural. It may also serve a way of rallying the people of the nation in support of a particular political goal. Nationalism usually involves a push for conformity, obedience, and solidarity amongst the nation&#x27;s people and can result not only in feelings of public responsibility but also in a narrow sense of community due to the exclusion of those who are considered outsiders. Since the identity of nationalists is linked to their allegiance to the state, the presence of strangers who do not share this allegiance may result in hostility.

===Classism===

Classism is defined by dictionary.com as &quot;a biased or discriminatory attitude on distinctions made between social or economic classes&quot;.

Some argue that economic inequality is an unavoidable aspect of society and the inequality of abilities, so there will always be a ruling class. Some also argue that, even within the most egalitarian societies in history, some form of ranking based on worth-based and worth-based individual status takes place. Therefore, one may believe the existence of social classes is a natural feature of society. Hierarchies can also be found in animals such as apes and other primates.

Others argue the contrary. According to anthropological evidence, for the majority of the time the human species has been in existence, humans have lived in a manner in which the land and resources were not privately owned, although were common merely among the members of the same kin-based band or tribe. Also, since it was kin-oriented, when social ranking did occur, it was not antagonistic or hostile like the current class system.

===Sexual discrimination===

Individuals with non-heterosexual sexual attraction, such as homosexuals and bisexuals, may experience hatred from others due to their sexual orientation; a term for such hatred based upon one&#x27;s sexual orientation is &quot;homophobia&quot;. However, more specific words for discrimination directed towards specific sexualities exist under other names, such as &quot;biphobia&quot;.

Due to what social psychologists call the vividness effect, a tendency to notice only certain distinctive characteristics, the majority population tends to draw conclusions like gays flaunt their sexuality. Such images may be easily recalled to mind due to their vividness, making it harder to appraise the entire situation. The majority population may not only think that homosexuals flaunt their sexuality or are &quot;too gay&quot;, but may also erroneously believe that homosexuals are easy to identify and label as being gay or lesbian when compared to others who are not homosexual.

The idea of heterosexual privilege has been known to flourish in society. Research and questionnaires are formulated to fit the majority; i.e., heterosexuals. The status of assimilating or conforming to heterosexual standards may be referred to as &quot;heteronormativity&quot;, or it may refer to ideology that the primary or only social norm is being heterosexual.

In the US legal system, all groups are not always considered equal under the law. The gay or queer panic defense is a term for defenses or arguments used to defend the accused in court cases, that defense lawyers may use to justify their client&#x27;s hate crime against someone that the client thought was LGBT. The controversy comes when defense lawyers use the victim&#x27;s minority status as an excuse or justification for crimes that were directed against them. This may be seen as an example of victim blaming. One method of this defense, homosexual panic disorder, is to claim that the victim&#x27;s sexual orientation, body movement patterns (such as their walking patterns or how they dance), or appearance that is associated with a minority sexual orientation provoked a violent reaction in the defendant. This is not a proven disorder, is no longer recognized by the DSM, and, therefore, is not a disorder that is medically recognized, but it is a term to explain certain acts of violence.

Research shows that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a powerful feature of many labor markets. For example, studies show that gay men earn 10–32% less than heterosexual men in the United States, and that there is significant discrimination in hiring on the basis of sexual orientation in many labor markets.

===Racism===

Racism is defined as the belief that physical characteristics determine cultural traits, and that racial characteristics make some groups superior. By separating people into hierarchies based upon their race, it has been argued that unequal treatment among the different groups of people is just and fair due to their genetic differences. Racism can occur amongst any group that can be identified based upon physical features or even characteristics of their culture. Though people may be lumped together and called a specific race, everyone does not fit neatly into such categories, making it hard to define and describe a race accurately.

====Scientific racism====
Scientific racism began to flourish in the eighteenth century and was greatly influenced by Charles Darwin&#x27;s evolutionary studies, as well as ideas taken from the writings of philosophers like Aristotle; for example, Aristotle believed in the concept of &quot;natural slaves&quot;. This concept focuses on the necessity of hierarchies and how some people are bound to be on the bottom of the pyramid. Though racism has been a prominent topic in history, there is still debate over whether race actually exists, making the discussion of race a controversial topic. Even though the concept of race is still being debated, the effects of racism are apparent. Racism and other forms of prejudice can affect a person&#x27;s behavior, thoughts, and feelings, and social psychologists strive to study these effects.

===Religious discrimination===
While various religions teach their members to be tolerant of those who are different and to have compassion, throughout history there have been wars, pogroms and other forms of violence motivated by hatred of religious groups.

In the modern world, researchers in western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic countries have done various studies exploring the relationship between religion and prejudice; thus far, they have received mixed results. A study done with US college students found that those who reported religion to be very influential in their lives seem to have a higher rate of prejudice than those who reported not being religious. Other studies found that religion has a positive effect on people as far as prejudice is concerned. This difference in results may be attributed to the differences in religious practices or religious interpretations amongst the individuals. Those who practice &quot;institutionalized religion&quot;, which focuses more on social and political aspects of religious events, are more likely to have an increase in prejudice. Those who practice &quot;interiorized religion&quot;, in which believers devote themselves to their beliefs, are most likely to have a decrease in prejudice.

===Linguistic discrimination===
Individuals or groups may be treated unfairly based solely on their use of language. This use of language may include the individual&#x27;s native language or other characteristics of the person&#x27;s speech, such as an accent or dialect, the size of vocabulary (whether the person uses complex and varied words), and syntax. It may also involve a person&#x27;s ability or inability to use one language instead of another. 

In the mid-1980s, linguist Tove Skutnabb-Kangas captured this idea of discrimination based on language as the concept of linguicism. Kangas defined linguicism as the ideologies and structures used to &quot;legitimate, effectuate, and reproduce unequal division of power and resources (both material and non-material) between groups which are defined on the basis of language&quot;.

===Neurological discrimination===

==== High-functioning ====
Broadly speaking, attribution of low social status to those who do not conform to non-autistic expectations of personality and behaviour. This can manifest through assumption of &#x27;disability&#x27; status to those who are high functioning enough to exist outside of diagnostic criteria, yet do not desire to (or are unable to) conform their behaviour to conventional patterns. This is a controversial and somewhat contemporary concept; with various disciplinary approaches promoting conflicting messages what normality constitutes, the degree of acceptable individual difference within that category, and the precise criteria for what constitutes medical disorder. This has been most prominent in the case of high-functioning autism, where direct cognitive benefits increasingly appear to come at the expense of social intelligence.

Discrimination may also extend to other high functioning individuals carrying pathological phenotypes, such as those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar spectrum disorders. In these cases, there are indications that perceived (or actual) socially disadvantageous cognitive traits are directly correlated with advantageous cognitive traits in other domains, notably creativity and divergent thinking, and yet these strengths might become systematically overlooked. The case for &quot;neurological discrimination&quot; as such lies in the expectation that one&#x27;s professional capacity may be judged by the quality of ones social interaction, which can in such cases be an inaccurate and discriminatory metric for employment suitability.

Since there are moves by some experts to have these higher-functioning extremes reclassified as extensions of human personality, any legitimisation of discrimination against these groups would fit the very definition of prejudice, as medical validation for such discrimination becomes redundant. Recent advancements in behavioural genetics and neuroscience have made this a very relevant issue of discussion, with existing frameworks requiring significant overhaul to accommodate the strength of findings over the last decade.

==Multiculturalism==

Humans have an evolved propensity to think categorically about social groups, manifested in cognitive processes with broad implications for public and political endorsement of multicultural policy, according to psychologists Richard J. Crisp and Rose Meleady. They postulated a cognitive-evolutionary account of human adaptation to social diversity that explains general resistance to multiculturalism, and offer a reorienting call for scholars and policy-makers who seek intervention-based solutions to the problem of prejudice.

==Reducing prejudice==

===Contact hypothesis===
The contact hypothesis predicts that prejudice can only be reduced when in-group and out-group members are brought together.

Academics Thomas Pettigrew and Linda Tropp conducted a meta-analysis of 515 studies involving a quarter of a million participants in 38 nations to examine how intergroup contact reduces prejudice. They found that three mediators are of particular importance: Intergroup contact reduces prejudice by (1) enhancing knowledge about the outgroup, (2) reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and (3) increasing empathy and perspective-taking. While all three of these mediators had mediational effects, the mediational value of increased knowledge was less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy. In addition, some individuals confront discrimination when they see it happen, with research finding that individuals are more likely to confront when they perceive benefits to themselves, and are less likely to confront when concerned about others&#x27; reactions.

===Jigsaw (teaching technique)===
In Elliot Aronson&#x27;s &quot;jigsaw&quot; teaching technique there are six conditions that must be met to reduce prejudice. First, the in- and out-groups must have a degree of mutual interdependence. Second, both groups need to share a common goal. Third, the two groups must have equal status. Fourth, there must be frequent opportunities for informal and interpersonal contact between groups. Fifth, there should be multiple contacts between the in- and the out-groups. Finally, social norms of equality must exist and be present to foster prejudice reduction.

<text>Acantha () is often claimed to be a minor character in Greek mythology whose metamorphosis was the origin of the &quot;Acanthus&quot; plant. Acantha&#x27;s myth however does not appear in any classical source.

== Mythology ==
The tale supposedly goes that Acantha was a nymph loved by the god Apollo. Acantha, however, rebuffed Apollo&#x27;s continued advances and scratched his face. As a result, Apollo transformed her into the Acanthus, a plant with spiny leaves.

== Origin of the myth ==
The story has, over the years, been retold in books, encyclopedias, and journals. Compilers have, however, often omitted reference to classical sources. For instance, the first edition of John Lemprière&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca Classica&quot;, an early encyclopaedia of mythological figures, provides no reference for the story. In the updated 1839 edition three references are given. These are to Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, Pedanius Dioscorides&#x27; &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; and Hesychius of Alexandria&#x27;s &quot;Lexicon&quot;. On inspection, however, Pliny makes absolutely no reference to Acantha, Dioscorides refers only to the plant and Hesychius simply explains what the word means. A number of latter compilers have similarly not cited classical references when retelling the myth.

The myth does not appear in the &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Latinae&quot;, a volume which includes every Latin word, including proper names. The &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Graecae&quot;, a similarly comprehensive source containing a complete repository of Ancient Greek texts from Homer through to A.D. 200, is also absent the myth. The story is not present in either the &quot;Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae&quot;, a work praised for its breadth and quality, or &quot;Der Neue Pauly&quot;, an encyclopaedia considered an unparalleled masterpiece of classical German scholarship.

Acantha&#x27;s tale has lifted elements from the myth of Oenone, a nymph who scratched Apollo&#x27;s face while he raped her, as attested in the poem &quot;Fasti&quot; by the Roman poet Ovid; that text however has been extended with various spurious post-Ovidian interpolations, and Oenone&#x27;s rape is, like Acantha herself, otherwise unattested. According to Cicero a woman named Acantho became the mother of the &quot;fourth sun&quot; in Rhodes.

<text>English cuisine encompasses the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with England. It has distinctive attributes of its own, but is also very similar to wider British cuisine, partly historically and partly due to the import of ingredients and ideas from the Americas, China, and India during the time of the British Empire and as a result of post-war immigration.

Some traditional meals, such as bread and cheese, roasted and stewed meats, meat and game pies, boiled vegetables and broths, and freshwater and saltwater fish have ancient origins. The 14th-century English cookbook, the &quot;Forme of Cury&quot;, contains recipes for these, and dates from the royal court of Richard II.

English cooking has been influenced by foreign ingredients and cooking styles since the Middle Ages. Curry was introduced from the Indian subcontinent and adapted to English tastes from the eighteenth century with Hannah Glasse&#x27;s recipe for chicken &quot;currey&quot;. French cuisine influenced English recipes throughout the Victorian era. After the rationing of the Second World War, Elizabeth David&#x27;s 1950 &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot; had wide influence, bringing Italian cuisine to English homes. Her success encouraged other cookery writers to describe other styles, including Chinese and Thai cuisine. England continues to absorb culinary ideas from all over the world.

== History ==

=== Middle Ages ===

English cooking has developed over many centuries since at least the time of &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot;, written in the Middle Ages around 1390 in the reign of King Richard II. The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes, with spicy sweet and sour sauces thickened with bread or quantities of almonds boiled, peeled, dried and ground, and often served in pastry. Foods such as gingerbread are described. It was not at all, emphasises Clarissa Dickson Wright in her &quot;A History of English Food&quot;, a matter of large lumps of roast meat at every meal as imagined in Hollywood films.

Instead, medieval dishes often had the texture of a purée, possibly containing small fragments of meat or fish: 48% of the recipes in the Beinecke manuscript are for dishes similar to stews or purées. Such dishes could be broadly of three types: somewhat acidic, with wine, vinegar, and spices in the sauce, thickened with bread; sweet and sour, with sugar and vinegar; and sweet, using then-expensive sugar. An example of such a sweet purée dish for meat (it could also be made with fish) from the Beinecke manuscript is the rich, saffron-yellow &quot;Mortruys&quot;, thickened with egg:

Another manuscript, &quot;Utilis Coquinario&quot;, mentions dishes such as &quot;pyany&quot;, poultry garnished with peonies; &quot;hyppee&quot;, a rose-hip broth; and birds such as cormorants and woodcocks.

=== Sixteenth century ===

The early modern period saw the gradual arrival of printed cookery books, though the first, the printer Richard Pynson&#x27;s 1500 &quot;Boke of Cokery&quot; was compiled from medieval texts. The next, &quot;A Proper Newe Booke of Cokerye&quot;, was published sometime after 1545. &quot;The Secretes of the Reverende Maister Alexis of Piermont&quot; was published in 1558, translated from a French translation of Alessio Piemontese&#x27;s original Italian work on confectionery. The number of titles expanded rapidly towards the end of the century to include Thomas Dawson&#x27;s &quot;The Good Huswifes Jewell&quot; in 1585, the &quot;Book of Cookrye&quot; by &quot;A. W.&quot; in 1591, and John Partridge&#x27;s &quot;The Good Hous-wives Handmaide&quot; in 1594. These books were of two kinds: collections of so-called secrets on confectionery and health remedies, aimed at aristocratic ladies; and advice on cookery and how to manage a household, aimed at women from more ordinary backgrounds, most likely wives of minor aristocrats, clergymen, and professional men.

English tastes evolved during the sixteenth century in at least three ways. First, recipes emphasise a balance of sweet and sour. Second, butter becomes an important ingredient in sauces, a trend which continued in later centuries. Third, herbs, which could be grown locally but had been little used in the Middle Ages, started to replace spices as flavourings. In A. W.&#x27;s &quot;Book of Cookrye&quot;, 35% of the recipes for meat stews and sauces include herbs, most commonly thyme. On the other hand, 76% of those meat recipes still used the distinctly mediaeval combination of sugar and dried fruit, together or separately. New ingredients were arriving from distant countries, too: &quot;The Good Huswifes Jewell&quot; introduced sweet potatoes (from the tropical Americas) alongside familiar medieval recipes.

&quot;Elinor Fettiplace&#x27;s Receipt Book&quot;, compiled in 1604 (and first published in 1986) gives an intimate view of Elizabethan cookery. The book provides recipes for various forms of bread, such as buttered loaves; for apple fritters; preserves and pickles; and a celebration cake for 100 people. New ingredients appear; a recipe for dressing a shoulder of mutton calls for the use of the newly available citrus fruits:

Pies were important both as food and for show; the nursery rhyme &quot;Sing a Song of Sixpence&quot;, with its lines &quot;Four and Twenty blackbirds / Baked in a pie. // When the pie was opened, The birds began to sing&quot; refers to the conceit of placing live birds under a pie crust just before serving at a banquet.

=== Seventeenth century ===

The bestselling cookery book of the early seventeenth century was Gervase Markham&#x27;s &quot;The English Huswife&quot;, published in 1615. It appears that his recipes were from the collection of a deceased noblewoman, and therefore dated back to Elizabethan times or earlier. Women were thus becoming both the authors of cookery books and their readers, though only about 10% of women in England were literate by 1640. Markham&#x27;s recipes are distinctively different from mediaeval ones; three quarters of his sauces for meat and meat pies make use of a combination of sweet and sour, and he advises:

Robert May&#x27;s &quot;The Accomplisht Cook&quot; was published in 1660 when he was 72 years old. The book included a substantial number of recipes for soups and stews, 38 recipes for sturgeon, and a large number of pies variously containing fish (including sturgeon), meat (including battalia pie), and sweet fillings.

French influence is evident in Hannah Woolley&#x27;s &quot;The Cooks Guide&quot;, 1664. Her recipes are designed to enable her non-aristocratic readers to imitate the fashionable French style of cooking with elaborate sauces. She combined the use of &quot;Claret wine&quot; and anchovies with more traditional cooking ingredients such as sugar, dried fruit, and vinegar.

=== Eighteenth century ===

John Nott&#x27;s &quot;The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary&quot; (1723), still with rather few precedents to go by, chose an alphabetical treatment for its recipes, from Al to Zest. The book covered everything from soups and salads to meat and fish, as well as pastries of many kinds, confectionery, and the making of beer, cider, and wine. Bills of fare are given for each month of the year.

James Woodforde&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Country Parson&quot; gives a good idea of the sort of food eaten in England in the eighteenth century by those who were reasonably prosperous. To welcome some neighbours on 8 June 1781, he gave them for dinner:

Another country clergyman, Gilbert White, in &quot;The Natural History of Selborne&quot; (1789) recorded the increased consumption of vegetables by ordinary country people in the south of England, to which, he noted, potatoes, from the Americas, had only been added during the reign of King George III:

Hannah Glasse&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy&quot; was the best-selling cookery book for a century from its publication in 1747. It ran to at least 40 editions, and was widely pirated.

=== Nineteenth century ===

English cooking was systematised and made available to the middle classes by a series of popular books, their authors becoming household names. One of the first was Mrs Rundell&#x27;s &quot;A New System of Domestic Cookery&quot;, 1806; it went through sixty-seven editions by 1844, selling hundreds of thousands of copies in Britain and America. This was followed by Eliza Acton&#x27;s &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot; 1845, which Bee Wilson has called &quot;the greatest cookery book in our language&quot;, but &quot;modern&quot; only in a nineteenth-century sense.

An example recipe from Acton&#x27;s &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot; is her &quot;Quince Blanc-Mange (Delicious)&quot;:

Acton was supplanted by the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot;, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton&#x27;s was a book to be read and enjoyed, Beeton&#x27;s, substantially written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of instructions and recipes, to be looked up as needed. &quot;Mrs Beeton&quot; was substantially plagiarised from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking for a series of aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book &quot;The Modern Cook&quot; ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people.

Three of the major hot drinks popular in England, tea, coffee, and chocolate, originated from outside Europe and were already staple items by Victorian times. Catherine of Braganza brought the Portuguese habit of tea to England around 1660. Initially, its expense restricted it to wealthy consumers, but the price gradually dropped, until by the 19th century its use was widespread. Introduced in the 16th century, coffee became popular by the 17th century, especially in the coffee houses, the first opening in Oxford in 1650. Hot chocolate was a popular drink by the 17th century, long before it was used as a food. Chocolate bars were developed and marketed by three English Quaker-founded businesses, Joseph Fry&#x27;s (1847), Rowntree&#x27;s (1862), and Cadbury&#x27;s (1868).

=== Twentieth century ===

After the First World War, many new food products became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships. Authors in the 1930s such as Lady Sysonby drew on recipes from a wide range of countries.

Rationing was introduced in 1940 to cope with the shortages caused by the wartime blockade. Foods such as bananas and chocolate became hard to find, while unfamiliar items such as dried egg, dried potato, whale meat, snook (a South African fish), and the tinned pork product Spam appeared in the national diet. Since butter, sugar, eggs and flour were all rationed, English dishes such as pies and cakes became hard to make from traditional recipes. Instead, foods such as carrots were used in many different dishes, their natural sugars providing sweetness in novel dishes like carrot fudge. The diet was less than enjoyable, but paradoxically, rationing meant that overall the population was healthier than ever before, and perhaps ever since. The Ministry of Food employed home economists such as Marguerite Patten to demonstrate how to cook economically. After the war, Patten became one of the first television cooks, and sold 17 million copies of her 170 books.

Elizabeth David profoundly changed English cooking with her 1950 &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot;. Written at a time of scarcity, her book began with &quot;perhaps the most evocative and inspirational passage in the history of British cookery writing&quot;:

All five of David&#x27;s early books remained in print half a century later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright was of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because David consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries which she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books paved the way for other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr (&quot;the galloping gourmet&quot;), and Robert Carrier.
== English dishes ==

In 1953, Britain&#x27;s first celebrity chef, Philip Harben, published &quot;Traditional Dishes of Britain&quot;. Its chapter titles simply listed &quot;the stereotypical stalwarts of the British diet&quot;, from Cornish pasty and Yorkshire pudding to shortbread, Lancashire hotpot, steak and kidney pudding, jellied eels, clotted cream and fish and chips. Panayi noted that Harben began with contradictions and unsupported claims, naming Britain&#x27;s supposed reputation for the worst food in the world, but claiming that the country&#x27;s cooks were technically unmatched and that the repertoire of national dishes was the largest of any country&#x27;s.

The sociologist Bob Ashley observed in 2004 that while people in Britain might agree that the core national diet consisted of items such as the full English breakfast, roast beef with all the trimmings, tea with scones, and fish and chips, few had ever eaten the canonical English breakfast, lunch and dinner in any single day, and many probably never ate any item from the list at all regularly. In any case, Ashley noted, the national diet changes with time, and cookery books routinely include dishes of foreign origin. He remarked that a National Trust café, whose manager claimed &quot;We&#x27;re not allowed to do foreign food ... I can&#x27;t do lasagne or anything like that&quot;, in fact served curry, because &quot;seemingly curry is English&quot;. Anglo-Indian cuisine has indeed been part of the national diet since the eighteenth century.

Some English dishes are relatively new and can be dated to the century, and sometimes to the year, of their introduction. Thus piccalilli was introduced from India in the 18th century, as recorded by Hannah Glasse who gave a recipe for it in 1758. Conversely, dishes and sauces still considered foreign, such as fish in sweet and sour sauce, have been in English recipe books since the Middle Ages. Other dishes took their present form only gradually, as with the so-called &quot;full English breakfast&quot;. Breakfasts of this kind are indeed described in later editions of &quot;Mrs Beeton&quot;, but as one of many variations. Thus her list of &quot;Family Breakfasts for a Week in Winter&quot; has for Wednesday something that looks fairly modern: &quot;bread, muffins, butter, brawn, grilled bacon, boiled eggs&quot;; but on other days less modern-looking breakfasts include mince, mutton cutlets, grilled kidneys, baked fresh herrings, and hash of cold game or poultry, while suggestions for &quot;Family Breakfasts for a Week in Summer&quot; included sardine toast, cold tongue, kedgeree and rissoles, and &quot;Guests&#x27; Breakfast (Autumn)&quot; included cold pheasant, game pie, and pressed beef.

== Influences ==

English cookery has demonstrably been open to influences from abroad from as early as the thirteenth century, and in the case of a few foods like sausages from Roman times. The Countess of Leicester, daughter of King John purchased large amounts of cinnamon, while King Edward I ordered large quantities of spices such as pepper and ginger, as well as of what was then an expensive imported luxury, sugar. Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that spices were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that this would have been as fatal then as it would be today. She suggests instead that spices were used to hide the taste of salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration.

Cradock asserted: &quot;The English have never had a cuisine. Even Yorkshire pudding comes from Burgundy.&quot; However, a recipe for &quot;a dripping pudding&quot; was published in the 1737 book &quot;The Whole Duty of a Woman&quot;. Nicola Humble observed that in &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot;, there are about the same number of recipes from India as from Wales, Scotland and Ireland together. Panayi created controversy by asserting, with evidence, that fish and chips had foreign origins: the fried fish from Jewish cooking and the potato chips from France; the dish only came to signify national identity from about 1930. French cuisine powerfully influenced English cooking throughout the nineteenth century, and French celebrity chefs such as the Roux brothers and Raymond Blanc continued to do so in twenty-first-century England.

=== The role of Empire ===

Curry was created by the arrival of the British in India in the seventeenth century, beginning as bowls of spicy sauce used, Lizzie Collingham writes, to add &quot;bite to the rather bland flavours of boiled and roasted meats.&quot; The 1748 edition of Hannah Glasse&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Cookery&quot; contains what Dickson Wright calls a &quot;famous recipe&quot; which describes how &quot;To make a currey the Indian way&quot;; it flavours chicken with onions fried in butter, the chicken being fried with turmeric, ginger and ground pepper, and stewed in its own stock with cream and lemon juice. Dickson Wright comments that she was &quot;a bit sceptical&quot; of this recipe, as it had few of the expected spices, but was &quot;pleasantly surprised by the result&quot; which had &quot;a very good and interesting flavour&quot;.

The process of adapting Indian cooking continued for centuries. Anglo-Indian recipes could completely ignore Indian rules of diet, for example by using pork or beef. Some dishes, such as &quot;liver curry, with bacon&quot; were simply ordinary recipes spiced up with ingredients such as curry powder. In other cases like kedgeree, Indian dishes were adapted to British tastes; &quot;khichari&quot; was originally a simple dish of lentils and rice. Curry was accepted in almost all Victorian era cookery books, such as Eliza Acton&#x27;s &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot; (1845): she offered recipes for curried sweetbreads and curried macaroni, merging Indian and European foods into standard English cooking. By 1895, curry was included in &quot;Dainty Dishes for Slender Incomes&quot;, aimed at the poorer classes.

Foreign influence was by no means limited to specific dishes. James Walvin, in his book &quot;Fruits of Empire&quot;, argues that potatoes, sugar (entirely imported until around 1900 and the growing of sugar beet), tea, and coffee as well as increasing quantities of spices were &quot;Fruits of Empire&quot; that became established in Britain between 1660 and 1800, so that by the nineteenth century &quot;their exotic origins had been lost in the mists of time&quot; and had become &quot;part of the unquestioned fabric of local life&quot;.

=== Indian and Anglo-Indian cuisine ===

During the British Raj, Britain first started borrowing Indian dishes, creating Anglo-Indian cuisine, with dishes such as kedgeree (1790) and Mulligatawny soup (1791). Indian food was served in coffee houses from 1809, and cooked at home from a similar date as cookbooks of the time attest. The Veeraswamy restaurant in Regent Street, London, was opened in 1926, at first serving Anglo-Indian food, and is the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in Britain. There was a sharp increase in the number of curry houses in the 1940s, and again in the 1970s.

The post-colonial Anglo-Indian dish chicken tikka masala was apparently invented in Glasgow in the early 1970s, while balti cuisine was introduced to Britain in 1977 in Birmingham. In 2003, there were roughly 9,000 restaurants serving Indian cuisine in Britain. The majority of Indian restaurants in Britain are run by entrepreneurs of Bangladeshi (often Sylhetis) and Pakistani origin. According to Britain&#x27;s Food Standards Agency, the Indian food industry in the United Kingdom was worth £3.2 billion in 2003, accounting for two-thirds of all eating out, and serving about 2.5 million British customers every week. 

Indian restaurants typically allow the diner to combine base ingredients — chicken, prawns or &quot;meat&quot; (lamb or mutton) — with curry sauces — from the mild korma to the scorching phall — without regard to the authenticity of the combination. The reference point for flavour and spice heat is the Madras curry sauce (the name represents the area of India where restaurateurs obtained their spices, rather than an actual dish). Other sauces are sometimes variations on a basic curry sauce: for instance, vindaloo is often rendered as a fiery dish of lamb or chicken in a Madras sauce with extra chilli, rather than the Luso-Indian dish of pork marinated in wine vinegar and garlic, based on a Goan Portuguese dish &quot;carne de vinha d&#x27;alhos&quot;.

Indian restaurants and their cuisine in Britain gradually improved from the stereotypical flock wallpaper and standardised menus. One of the pioneers was the Bombay Brasserie, which opened in Gloucester Road, London, in 1982, serving the kind of food actually eaten in India. Vegetarian Indian restaurants opened in the 1980s in the Drummond Street area of Euston, London. In 1990 Chutney Mary followed in Chelsea. In 2001, two Indian restaurants in London, Tamarind (opened 1995) and Zaika (opened 1999) gained Michelin stars for the quality of their cooking.

Indian cuisine is the most popular alternative to traditional cooking in Britain, followed by Chinese and Italian food. By 2015, chicken tikka masala was one of Britain&#x27;s most popular dishes.

=== Southeast and East Asian cuisines ===

Southeast and East Asian cuisines have become widely available across England. Chinese cuisine became established in England by the 1970s, with large cities often having a Chinatown district; the one in London&#x27;s Soho developed between the two world wars, following an informal area in Limehouse. Deriving from Cantonese cuisine, the food served by Chinese restaurants has been adapted to suit English taste. From around 1980 onwards, Southeast Asian cuisines, especially Thai and Vietnamese, began to gain popularity in England.

=== European cuisines ===

Italian cuisine is the most popular Mediterranean cuisine in England. In its current form, inspired by Elizabeth David, its rise began after 1945. There were some Italian restaurants before World War II, but they mostly served a generalised haute cuisine. Soon after the war, Italian coffee bars appeared, the first places to trade on their Italian identity; they soon started to sell simple and cheap Italian food such as minestrone soup, spaghetti and pizza. From the early 1960s, the slightly more elegant trattoria restaurants offered &quot;Italian specialities&quot; such as lasagne verdi al forno (baked lasagne, coloured with spinach). Other Mediterranean influences include Greek moussaka, feta and taramasalata, Turkish doner and shish kebabs, and Middle Eastern hummus.

French cuisine in England is largely restricted to expensive restaurants, although there are some inexpensive French bistros.
For many years, English writers including Hannah Glasse in the 18th century and Andrew Kirwan in the 19th century were ambivalent about French cooking. However, restaurants serving French haute cuisine developed for the upper and middle classes in England from the 1830s and Escoffier was recruited by the Savoy Hotel in 1890. Marcel Boulestin&#x27;s 1923 &quot;Simple French Cooking for English Homes&quot; did much to popularise French dishes.

== Food establishments ==

=== Cafes and tea shops ===

The English cafe is a small, inexpensive eating place. A working men&#x27;s cafe serves mainly fried or grilled food, such as fried eggs, bacon, bangers and mash‚ black pudding, bubble and squeak, burgers, sausages, mushrooms and chips. These may be accompanied by baked beans, cooked tomatoes, and fried bread. These are referred to as &quot;breakfast&quot; even if they are available all day. Traditional cafes have declined with the rise of fast-food chains, but remain numerous all over the UK.

A tea shop is a small restaurant that serves soft drinks and light meals, often in a sedate atmosphere. Customers may eat a cream tea in Cornish or Devonshire style, served from a china set, and a scone with jam and clotted cream.

=== Fish and chip shops ===

Fish and chips is a hot dish consisting of battered fish, commonly Atlantic cod or haddock, and chips. It is a common take-away food.

Western Sephardic Jews settling in England from the 16th century would have prepared fried fish like &quot;pescado frito&quot;, coated in flour and fried in oil. Chips appeared in the Victorian era; Dickens&#x27;s 1859 &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; mentions &quot;husky chips of potatoes, fried with some reluctant drops of oil&quot;. Panayi states that fish and chip shops in the 1920s were often run by Jews or Italians. Despite this, the new dish was popularly attributed to France; &quot;The Times&quot; recorded that &quot;potatoes chipped and fried in the French manner were introduced in Lancashire with great success about 1871.&quot; The &quot;Fish Trades Gazette&quot; of 29 July 1922 stated that &quot;Later there was introduced into this country the frying and purveying of chip potatoes from France ... which had made the fried fish trade what it is today.&quot;

=== Pub food ===

The public house, or pub, is a famous English institution. In the mid-20th century, pubs were drinking establishments with little emphasis on the serving of food, other than &quot;bar snacks&quot;, such as pork scratchings, pickled eggs, salted crisps, and peanuts, which helped to increase beer sales. If a pub served meals these were usually basic cold dishes such as a ploughman&#x27;s lunch, invented in the 1950s.

In the 1950s some British pubs started to offer &quot;a pie and a pint&quot;, with hot individual steak and ale pies made on the premises by the landlord or his wife. In the 1960s this was developed into the then-fashionable &quot;chicken in a basket&quot;, a portion of roast chicken with chips, served on a napkin, in a wicker basket, by the Mill pub at Withington. Quality dropped but variety increased with the introduction of microwave ovens and freezer food. &quot;Pub grub&quot; expanded to include British food items such as steak and kidney pudding, shepherd&#x27;s pie, fish and chips, bangers and mash, Sunday roast, and pasties. The gastropub movement of the 21st century, on the other hand, has sought to serve restaurant-quality food, cooked to order from fresh ingredients, in a pub setting; one pub, The Hand &amp; Flowers in Marlow has been awarded two Michelin stars, and several have one star. In 1964, pubs were serving 9.1% of meals eaten outside the home; this rose rapidly to 37.5% by 1997.

== Vegetarianism ==

Modern Western vegetarianism was founded in the United Kingdom in 1847 with the world&#x27;s first Vegetarian Society. It has increased markedly since the end of World War II, when there were around 100,000 vegetarians in the country. By 2003 there were between 3 and 4 million vegetarians in the UK, one of the highest percentages in the Western world, while around 7 million people claim to eat no red meat. By 2015, 11 of 22 restaurant chains studied by the Vegan Society had at least one vegan main course on their menu, though only 6 of these explicitly labelled them as vegan dishes. Top-end vegetarian restaurants remain relatively few, though they are increasing rapidly: there were some 20 in Britain in 2007, rising to 30 in 2010.

== Quality ==

English cuisine in the twentieth century suffered from a poor international reputation. Keith Arscott of Chawton House Library comments that &quot;at one time people didn&#x27;t think the English knew how to cook and yet these [eighteenth and nineteenth century] female writers were at the forefront of modern-day cooking.&quot; English food was popularly supposed to be bland, but English cuisine has made extensive use of spices since the Middle Ages; introduced curry to Europe; and makes use of strong flavourings such as English mustard. It was similarly reputed to be dull, like roast beef: but that dish was highly prized both in Britain and abroad, and few people could afford it; the &quot;Roast Beef of Old England&quot; lauded by William Hogarth in his 1748 painting celebrated the high quality of English cattle, which the French at the &quot;Gate of Calais&quot; (the other name of his painting) could only look at with envy. The years of wartime shortages and rationing certainly did impair the variety and flavour of English food during the twentieth century, but the nation&#x27;s cooking recovered from this with increasing prosperity and the availability of new ingredients from soon after the Second World War.

In 2005, 600 food critics writing for the British &quot;Restaurant&quot; magazine named 14 British restaurants among the 50 best restaurants in the world, the number one being The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, led by its chef Heston Blumenthal. The quality of London&#x27;s best restaurants has made the city a leading centre of international cuisine.

Meanwhile, the list of United Kingdom food and drink products with protected status (PDO) under European Union law has increased rapidly, with 59 items including Cornish sardines, Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese and Yorkshire forced rhubarb, Fenland celery, West Country lamb and beef and traditional Cumberland sausage listed as registered in 2015, and a further 13 including Birmingham Balti listed as applied for. By 2016 there were 12 cheeses from England with PDO status.

<text>Deianira, Deïanira, or Deianeira ( ; , or , ), also known as Dejanira, is a Calydonian princess in Greek mythology whose name translates as &quot;man-destroyer&quot; or &quot;destroyer of her husband&quot;. She was the wife of Heracles and, in late Classical accounts, his unwitting murderer, killing him with the poisoned Shirt of Nessus. She is the main character in Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Women of Trachis&quot;.

== Family ==
Deianira was the daughter of Althaea and her husband Oeneus (whose name means &quot;wine-man&quot;), the king of Calydon (after the wine-god gave the king the vine to cultivate), and the sister of Meleager. Her other siblings were Toxeus, Clymenus, Periphas, Agelaus (or Ageleus), Thyreus (or Phereus or Pheres), Gorge, Eurymede and Melanippe.

In some accounts, Deianira was the daughter of King Dexamenus of Olenus and thus, sister to Eurypylus, Theronice and Theraephone. Others called this daughter of Dexamenus as Mnesimache or Hippolyte.

Deianira was the mother of Onites, Hyllus, Glenus, Onites, Ctesippus, and Macaria, who saved the Athenians from defeat by Eurystheus.

== Mythology and literature ==


=== Marriage ===

In Sophocles&#x27; account of Deianira&#x27;s marriage, she was courted by the river god Achelous, but was saved from having to marry him by Heracles, who defeated Achelous in a wrestling contest for her hand in marriage.

In another version of the tale, where she was described as the daughter of Dexamenus, Heracles raped her and promised to come back and marry her. While he was away, the centaur Eurytion appeared and demanded her as his wife. Her father, being afraid, agreed, but Heracles returned before the marriage and slew the centaur and claimed his bride.

Deianira was associated with combat, and was described as someone who &quot;drove a chariot and practiced the art of war.&quot;

=== Death of Heracles ===
The most famous story containing Deianira concerns the Shirt of Nessus. A wild centaur named Nessus attempted to kidnap or rape Deianira as he was ferrying her across the river Euenos, but she was rescued by Heracles, who shot the centaur with an arrow laced with the venom of the Hydra. As he lay dying, Nessus persuaded Deianira to take a sample of his blood, claiming that, when mixed with his semen, it would create a love potion that would ensure Heracles would never again be unfaithful.

When Heracles fell in love with the younger and more beautiful Iole, Deianira, fearing that she would lose her husband, decided to use the potion. She soaked a tunic or shirt (perhaps Heracles&#x27; famous lionskin shirt) in the potion. When Heracles put on the shirt, the venom from the very arrow he had used to kill Nessus began to burn and eat away at his skin. When he tried to remove the shirt, he tore off chunks of his own flesh. Eventually, unable to bear the pain any longer, Heracles built a funeral pyre and immolated himself. When Deianira realized what she had done, she committed suicide, either by hanging or by a sword. 

=== Middle Age tradition ===
She is remembered in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Achelous (also Acheloos or Acheloios) (; Ancient Greek: Ἀχελώϊος, and later , &quot;Akhelôios&quot;) was the god associated with the Achelous River, the largest river in Greece. According to Hesiod, he was the son of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys. He was also said to be the father of the Sirens, several nymphs, and other offspring.

Achelous was able to change his shape, and in the form of a bull, he wrestled Heracles for the right to marry Deianeira, but lost. He was also involved in the legend of the Argive hero Alcmaeon.

==Etymology==
The name Ἀχελώϊος is possibly pre-Greek, its meaning is not entirely certain. Recent arguments suggest it is Semitic in origin, with the initial Αχ- stemming from the Akkadian &quot;aḫu&quot; (&quot;bank of the river&quot;), or &quot;aḫû&quot; (&quot;seashore&quot;) and the suffix -ελώἴος, from the Akkadian &quot;illu&quot; (&quot;watercourse&quot; or &quot;water of the river invading land&quot;). According to linguist , the Thracian river name &quot;Achelōos&quot; (alternatively, &quot;Achēlon&quot; and &quot;Achelon&quot;), located near Anchialo, in the Black Sea, is cognate to the Greek word, both deriving from a Proto-Indo-European stem &quot;*ɘku̯el&quot;, meaning &#x27;water&#x27;.

==Family==
According to Hesiod, Achelous, along with all the other river gods, was the son of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys. According to the sixth-century mythographer Acusilaus, Achelous was the &quot;oldest and most honoured&quot; of the river-god offspring of Oceanus. Servius, relating a tradition of unknown origin, reports that Achelous was said to have been the son of Earth (i.e. Gaia).

Achelous had various offspring. He was said to be the father of the Sirens. According to the 3rd-century BC poet Lycophron, the Sirens were the daughters of Achelous, by an unnamed &quot;melodious mother&quot; (perhaps meaning the mother was a Muse), while Ovid calls the Sirens simply daughters of Achelous, with no mention of their mother. Another 3rd-century BC, poet Apollonius of Rhodes, makes the mother the Muse Terpsichore, while according to other accounts, she was the Muse Melpomene, or the Calydonian princess Sterope. By Perimede, the daughter of Aeolus, Achelous was said to have fathered Hippodamas and Orestes.

Achelous was also said to be the father (with no mothers mentioned) of several nymphs associated with various famous springs. These included Pirene, the nymph of a spring at Corinth, Castalia, the nymph of a spring at Delphi, and Dirce, the nymph of a spring (and the stream that flowed from it) at Thebes, which became associated with the Dirce who was Antiope&#x27;s aunt. Plato has &quot;the nymphs&quot; as daughters of Achelous, and the 5th-century BC poet Panyassis seems also to have referred to &quot;Achelesian nymphs&quot;. He was also the father (again with no mother mentioned) of Alcmeon&#x27;s second wife Callirrhoe, whose name means &quot;the lovely spring&quot;. Such examples suggest the possibility of a tradition in which Achelous was considered to be the father of all springs or, at least, the nymphs associated with them.

==Mythology==
===Heracles and Deianeira===

Achelous was a suitor for Deianeira, daughter of Oeneus, the king of Calydon; he transformed himself into a bull and fought Heracles for the right to marry Deianeira, but was defeated, and Heracles married Deianeira. The story of Achelous, in the form of a bull, battling with Heracles for Deianeira, was apparently told as early as the 7th century BC, in a lost poem by the Greek poet Archilochus, while according to a summary of a lost poem by the early 5th-century BC Greek poet Pindar, during the contest, Heracles broke off one of Achelous&#x27;s bull-horns, and the river-god was able to get his horn back by trading it for a horn from Amalthea.

Sophocles, in his play &quot;Women of Trachis&quot; (c. 450–425 BC), has Deianeira tell her story, how Achelous wooed her in the shape of a bull, a snake, and a half-man/half-bull:

In later accounts, Achelous does not get his horn back, as he does in Pindar&#x27;s poem. Ovid, in his poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (8 AD), has Achelous tell a different story. In this version, Achelous fights Heracles, and loses three times: first in his normal (human?) shape, then as a snake, and finally as a bull. Heracles tore off one of Achelous&#x27;s bull-horns, and the Naiads filled the horn with fruit and flowers, transforming it into the &quot;Horn of Plenty&quot; (cornucopia). According to the &quot;Fabulae&quot; (before 207 AD), by the Latin mythographer Hyginus, Heracles gave the broken-off horn to &quot;the Hesperides (or Nymphs)&quot;, and it was &quot;these goddesses&quot; who &quot;filled the horn with fruit and called it &quot;Cornucopia&quot;. According to Strabo, in some versions of the story Heracles gave Achelous&#x27;s horn to Deianeira&#x27;s father Oeneus as a wedding gift. While several sources make Achelous the father, by various mothers, of the Sirens (see above), according to the 4th-century AD Greek teacher of rhetoric Libanius, they were born from the blood Achelous shed when Heracles broke off his horn.

The breaking off of Achelous&#x27; horn was rationalized as Heracles&#x27; diversion of the Acarnanian river. Both Diodorus Siculus and Strabo give such accounts. According to Diodorus, Heracles diverted the Achelous River&#x27;s course, while according to Strabo, some writers &quot;conjecturing the truth from the myths&quot; said that, to please his father-in-law Oeneus, Heracles confined the river by means of &quot;embankments and channels&quot;. In this way, Heracles defeated the raging river, and in so doing created a large amount of new fertile land and &quot;certain poets, as we are told, have made this deed into a myth&quot; (Diodorus). By both accounts, this new bountiful land of the Achelous River delta came to be known as Amaltheia&#x27;s horn of plenty.

Joseph Fontenrose saw in this story the possible reflection of an ancient tradition of conflict between Zeus and Achelous. For the Latin poets during the Roman Imperial period, from Propertius onward, the story of Heracles and Achelous&#x27; contest for Deianeria continued to be popular, with Achelous as &quot;the stereotypical unlucky lover&quot;.

=== Alcmaeon===
Achelous played a role in the story of the Argive hero Alcmaeon, who had killed his mother Eriphyle because of her treachery against his father Amphiaraus, and needed to be religiously purified. According to Apollodorus, Alcmaeon was first purified by Phegeus the king of Psophis, but nevertheless the land of Psophis became barren because of the cursed Alcmaeon&#x27;s presence. As Thucydides tells the story, the oracle of Apollo told Alcmaeon that he needed to find a land to live in that did not yet exist at the time of his mother&#x27;s death. After long travels, Alcmaeon finally came to the springs of the Achelous River, where he was purified by the river-god, and received Achelous&#x27;s daughter Callirrhoe as his wife, and at the mouth of the river he discovered a land newly made by deposits of river silt, where he could make his home free of his curse. Later, according to Apollodorus, Achelous commanded Alcmaeon to dedicate the necklace and robe—the cause of his mother&#x27;s treachery—at Delphi, which he did.

===Creation of islands===
Ovid, in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, has the river-god involved in two transformation stories concerning the creation of islands near the mouth of the Achelous River. According to Ovid, the Echinades Islands were once five local nymphs. One day, the nymphs were offering sacrifices to the gods on the banks of the Achelous, but they forgot to include Achelous himself. The river-god became so angry, he overflowed his banks with a raging flood, sweeping the nymphs away into the sea. As Achelous tells the story:

Achelous goes on to describe the creation of another island: &quot;far away beyond the others is one island that I love: the sailors call it Perimele.&quot; She was the daughter of Hippodamas, whose virginity Achelous took from her. Her enraged father threw her off a high cliff into the sea. But Achelous prayed to Poseidon to save her, and in answer Poseidon transformed the girl into an island.

==Water and wine==
Achelous&#x27;s name could be used to refer to water (or fresh water?) in general. Thus Euripides can have a house, far from the Achelous river itself, being sprinkled with &quot;Achelous&#x27; water&quot;, or have servants &quot;bring Achelous&quot; [&quot;Ἀχελῷον φέρειν&quot;] to douse a fire, while the comic playwright Aristophanes, in his &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, has the Woman&#x27;s chorus leader, while pouring water on the Men&#x27;s chorus, say &quot;Achelous, you’re on!&quot;.

In particular, his name was used to refer to the water that was mixed with wine for drinking. Examples include three fragments from now lost fifth-century BC Attic plays. A Sophocles fragment has the single line: &quot;So Achelous runs with wine in our place&quot;, and a fragment from a satyr play by Achaeus has unhappy satyrs complaining about too much &quot;of Achelous&quot; being mixed with the wine they are being given to drink. An Aristophanes fragment has a character complain about the aftereffects of drinking unwatered wine:
Ovid, in his &quot;Fasti&quot;, uses Achelous&#x27; name as a stand in for water when he connects wine drinking with the wearing of flowers in the hair:
Virgil has Liber (Dionysus) responsible for the mixing of the &quot;draughts of Achelous&quot; with wine.
While according to Hyginus, a man named Cerasus was the first to mix wine with &quot;the Achelous river in Aetolia&quot;, explaining that this is why the word for &quot;mixing&quot; in Greek is &quot;cerasai&quot;. Achelous is also mythologicaly linked with Dionysus and wine, through his connection with Deianeira, and her father Oeneus. There are various stories involving Oeneus (whose name means &quot;Wine-man&quot;) Dionysus, and the origins of wine. According to Apollodorus, Oeneus was the first mortal given the grape vine by Dionysus. Hyginus explains that Oeneus was given the grape vine and instruction on viticulture by the wine-god, as a reward for his &quot;generous hospitality&quot; in having turned a blind eye to the god seducing his wife and fathering Deianeira.

==Cult==

Achelous was a rural-agricultural water god whose importance was a reflection of the agricultural importance of rivers and their fertile river deltas. This relationship is also reflected in the association of Achelous&#x27; broken-off horn with the cornucopia or horn of plenty. Apparently some ancient Greeks considered sacrifices to Achelous to be even more important than those to the agriculture goddess Demeter. Many inscriptions attest to the cult of Achelous, which was particularly associated with the oracle at Dodona. Although of early importance, his cult declined in significance from the end of the fourth-century BC.

From at least as early as Homer, Achelous was apparently considered to be an important divinity throughout Greece. Calling Achelous &quot;king&quot;, Homer mentions Achelous (along with Oceanus) as a mighty river, using him as a measure of the strength of (the even mightier) Zeus:

The clear implication is that Achelous is the mightiest of the rivers (save perhaps for Oceanus himself), which would be in accord with Acusilaus&#x27; making Achelous the &quot;oldest and most honoured&quot; of the river-god offspring of Oceanus. However some ancient scholars thought that the line: &quot;nor the great might of deep-flowing Ocean&quot;, was spurious, which would in fact make Achelous—rather than Oceanus—the source of all other waters. A commentary on &quot;Iliad&quot; 21.195, preserved on Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 221, contains a fragment of a poem, possibly from the Epic tradition, which mentions &quot;the waters of silver-eddying Achelous&quot; being the source of &quot;the whole sea&quot;. A late-5th-century BC commentary on an Orphic theogony, preserved by the Derveni Papyrus, quotes a poetic fragment calling the rivers the &quot;sinews of Achelous&quot;. The same Oxyrhynchus Papyrus also quotes ancient verses which apparently equated Achelous and Oceanus, and that &quot;many people sacrifice to Achelois before sacrificing to Demeter, since Acheloios is the name of all rivers and the crop comes from water&quot;.

Achelous as a cultic figure is attested as early as the seventh century BC. The 2nd-century geographer Pausanias, reports seeing, near Megara, an altar to Achelous erected by the seventh-century BC &quot;tyrant&quot;, Theagenes of Megara. Achelous was the only river-god to achieve Panhellenic cult status. By the fifth century BC he shared many sanctuaries with his daughters the nymphs. Achelous appears in many votive reliefs which often include nymphs. Such reliefs were given as dedications in sanctuaries. A votive relief (Athens 1488), dedicated to &quot;Pan and the Nymphs&quot;, shows Hermes leading three nymphs in a cave, with a relief head of Achelous depicted on the wall of the cave. In a similar votive relief (Athens 1859), Achelous is depicted as a bull with a human head. Achelous could also be venerated in the form of stylized votive masks, similar to the cult masks of the wine-god Dionysus. A well-known example of such a cult mask, considered to be Achelous, is a marble mask (c. 490–470 BC) from Marathon (Berlin SK 100).

According to the early 4th-century BC Greek historian Ephorus, the oracle at Dodona usually added to his pronouncements the command to offer sacrifices to Achelous, and that, while people would offer sacrifices to their local river, only the Achelous river was honoured everywhere, with Achelous&#x27;s name often being invoked in oaths, prayers and sacrifices, &quot;all the things that concern the gods&quot;. Ephorus, explaining the &quot;puzzle&quot; of why Achelous name was used to mean water, said that, because of the frequent oracular command at Dodona to offer sacrifices to Achelous, it came to be thought that by &quot;Achelous&quot; the oracle meant, not the river but &quot;water&quot; in general.

Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedrus&quot; has Socrates, walking in the countryside along the Ilissus river, come across a &quot;sacred place of some nymphs and of Achelous, judging by the figurines and statues&quot;. In addition to the altar to Achelous near Megara, Pausanias also mentions a part of the altar at the Amphiareion of Oropos dedicated to &quot;the nymphs and to Pan, and to the rivers Achelous and Cephisus&quot;, and the Megarian Treasury at Olympia, which contained a dedication representing the fight of Heracles with Achelous.

==River-gods and bulls==
Achelous as a bull in the story of his contest with Heracles is part of a Greek tradition, perhaps as old as Homer (or older), of associating rivers and river-gods with bulls. Strabo reports that according to some &quot;the Acheloüs, like the other rivers, was called &#x27;like a bull&#x27; from the roaring of its waters, and also from the bendings of its streams, which were called Horns&quot;. This association is reflected in the fact that the Greeks depicted river-gods as part bull from at least the Archaic period onward. There is also an ancient association between horns and the fertility that rivers provide, as can be seen in the story of the horn of plenty.

==Iconography==
Achelous was a popular subject in ancient Greek art. There are many depictions of his fight with Heracles over Deianeira, with over twenty surviving examples in Attic vase painting alone. Achelous also appears in many votive reliefs along with other divinities often including nymphs. In these contexts, in which the identity of the figure as Achelous is secured by inscription, the river-god is characteristically portrayed in the form of a man-bull, i.e. a bull with a bull-horned and bull-eared human face, head or torso and a bison-like beard, either in full-figure, or in the abbreviated form of a man-bull torso, head or particularly a mask. Achelous&#x27; man-bull iconography probably derived from oriental art. Much more rarely, Achelous can also be found depicted in human form. Besides Greek art, Achelous was also a common figure in Etruscan art. 

===Achelous and Heracles===
Achelous&#x27; contest with Heracles was the subject of many vase-paintings, from as early as the second quarter of the sixth century BC, and in most of these vases, Heracles can be seen grabbing Achelous by his single horn. Possibly the earliest version of the scene (c. 600–560 BC) appears on the figure frieze of a Middle Corinthian kylix cup (Brussels A1374), which depicts Heracles wrestling with a horned centaur-like Achelous, with a human torso and a bull&#x27;s or horse&#x27;s body, watched by the figure of an old man (Oineus?) and a woman (Deianeira?). The earliest (c. 570 BC) Attic versions (New York 59.64, Boston 99.519) depict Achelous as a bull with a man&#x27;s head and beard. Although many early depiction of this scene represent Achelous as a centaur, by the fifth century BC he is commonly represented as a bull with a human face.

On one later example (c. 525–475 BC), an Attic red-figure stamnos from Cerveteri attributed to Oltos (British Museum E437), Achelous (identified by inscription) is shown with a bearded human upper torso, attached to a long serpentine body, with a fish&#x27;s tail. This is similar to the depictions of the sea-god Triton which appear on many other Attic vases. Heracles (also identified by inscription) appears about to break off the river-god&#x27;s single horn. On a somewhat later (c. 475–425 BC) red-figure Attic column krater (Louvre G365), Achelous&#x27;s broken-off horn lies on the ground, while Heracles holds Achelous by his other horn, and threatens him with a club held overhead. Figures depicting Oineus and Deianeira (as on Louvre G365) and also Athena and Hermes are sometimes included in the scene.

Pausanias reports seeing the scene represented on the throne of Amyclae, and also in the Megarian Treasury at Olympia, where he describes seeing &quot;small cedar-wood figures inlaid with gold&quot; which, besides Achelous, included Zeus, Deianeira, Heracles, and Ares aiding Achelous.

===Votive reliefs===
Beginning in the late fifth century BC, Achelous also appears in many votive reliefs. Such reliefs often include his daughters the nymphs. Three marble Attic reliefs (Athens 1445, 1448, and 1859) have the form of a cave, with four central figures, a male leading three nymphs, all holding hands gathered around a small stone altar (dancing?). Achelous, along with other figures, is represented as being carved into the cave wall. In two of these (1448 and 1859, pictured above) the male central figure is Hermes, in the other he is Pan. Votive reliefs without nymphs are also common. A votive relief (Athens 1778), dedicated to Zeus and found near the Ilissos river, shows Zeus sitting on a stone seat decorated with the face of Achelous.

===Other contexts===
Although depictions of Achelous in the form of a man-bull in Heracles scenes and votive reliefs are very common, far more common are depictions of a man-bull unaccompanied by other figures. In these contexts—where no inscription allows certain identification—the interpretation of such an individual man-bull as being Achelous is inferred. In particular, depictions of a man-bull are found on the coins of many cites in Magna Graecia, Sicily, and elsewhere. In addition to vase paintings, votive reliefs, and coins, man-bull depictions can also be found on many other kinds of artifacts, including gems, jewelry, bronzes, and architectural terracottas.

==Possible origins==
That Achelous, rather than Oceanus, was perhaps, in some earlier version of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the source of &quot;all rivers ... and every sea&quot;, and that his name was often used to mean &quot;water&quot; (along with other evidence from ancient sources), have suggested the possibility to modern scholars that Achelous may have predated Oceanus as the original Greek water-god.

A recent study has tried to show that both the form and substance of Achelous, as a god of water primarily depicted as a man-faced bull, have roots in Old Europe in the Bronze Age, and that after the disappearance of many Old European cultures, the traditions traveled to the Near East at the beginning of 4th millennium BC (Ubaid period), and finally migrated to Greece, Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia with itinerant sea-folk during the Late Bronze Age through the Orientalizing period. Although no single cult of Achelous persisted throughout all of these generations, the iconography and general &quot;mythos&quot; easily spread from one culture to another, and all examples of man-faced bulls are found around the area of the Mediterraneanan, suggesting some intercultural continuity.

Achelous was also an important deity in the Etruscan religion, intimately related to water as in the Greek tradition but also carrying significant chthonic associations. Man-faced bull iconography was first adapted to represent Achelous by the Etruscans in the 8th century BC, and the Greeks later adopted this same tradition.

The leading exponents into the Greek and Etruscan worlds were seer-healers and mercenaries during the Iron Age, and Achelous as a man-faced bull becomes an emblem employed by mercenaries in the Greek world for centuries. These earlier figures probably adapted the mythological and iconographic traditions of Asallúhi (also Asarlúhi or Asaruludu), the &quot;princely bison&quot; of Near Eastern traditions that &quot;rises to the surface of the earth in springs and marshes, ultimately flowing as rivers&quot;.

==The Achelous River==

The Achelous River rises in the Pindus mountains, flows into the Ionian Sea near the Echinades Islands in western Greece, and divided ancient Acarnania and Aetolia. Servius gives a story of the origin of the river. He says that one day Achelous, who was said to be the son of Earth, lost his daughters the Sirens, and in his grief he called upon his mother, who received him into her bosom, and on that spot, Earth caused a river, bearing his name, to gush forth.

Pseudo-Plutarch gives a different story for how the river acquired its name. He says it was formerly called Thestius, after a son of Mars and Pisidice, who jumped into the river after discovering he had killed his son Calydon by mistake. In a similar fashion the river acquired the name Achelous, after a son of Oceanus and the nymph Naïs, who jumped into the river after he discovered he had slept with his daughter Cletoria by mistake.

Strabo reports that in &quot;earlier times&quot; the river was called the Thoas. According to Strabo, some writers &quot;conjecturing the truth from the myths&quot; attributed various legends concerning the river-god, to features of the Achelous River itself. These writers said that, like other rivers, the Achelous was called &quot;like a bull&quot;, because of the river&#x27;s roaring waters and its meanders (which he says were called horns). Likewise the Achelous was called &quot;like a serpent&quot; because of the river&#x27;s great length and many serpentine turnings.

Achelous was a common river name. There were several other rivers with that name in ancient times. In addition to &quot;king Achelous&quot;, Homer apparently knew of an Achelous river in Lydia, near Mount Sipylos:
Strabo mentions two other rivers named Achelous, one in Achaea near Dyme, also called the Peiros, the other in Thessaly near Lamia. Pausanias mentions one more, a tributary of the Alpheius in the Peloponnese, near Mount Lycaeus in Arcadia. The multiplicity of rivers with the same name, perhaps due to the river-god&#x27;s equation with water, has also been seen as suggesting the possibility that Achelous was originally &quot;the primal source of all water&quot;.

==The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;==
Ovid, in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, provided a descriptive interlude when Theseus is the guest of Achelous, waiting for the river&#x27;s raging flood to subside: &quot;He entered the dark building, made of spongy pumice, and rough tuff. The floor was moist with soft moss, and the ceiling banded with freshwater mussel and oyster shells.&quot;

<text>The Acheron ( or ; &quot;Acheron&quot; or Ἀχερούσιος &quot;Acherousios&quot;; &quot;Acherontas&quot;) is a river in the Epirus region of northwest Greece. It is long, and has a drainage area of . The river&#x27;s source is located near the village Zotiko, in the southwestern part of the Ioannina regional unit. The Acheron flows into the Ionian Sea in Ammoudia, near Parga.

The Acheron also features prominently in Greek mythology, where it is often depicted as the entrance to the Greek Underworld where souls must be ferried across by Charon (although some later sources, such as Roman poets, assign this role to the river Styx).

==Mythology==
Ancient Greek mythology saw the Acheron, sometimes known as the &quot;river of woe&quot;, as one of the five rivers of the Greek underworld. The name is of uncertain etymology.

Most classical accounts, including Pausanias (10.28) and later Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; (3.78), portray the Acheron as the entrance to the Underworld and depict Charon ferrying the souls of the dead across it. Ancient Greek literary sources such as Pindar, Aeschylus, Euripides, Plato, and Callimachus also place Charon on the Acheron. Roman poets, including Propertius, Ovid, and Statius, name the river as the Styx, perhaps following the geography of Virgil&#x27;s underworld in the &quot;Aeneid,&quot; where Charon is associated with both rivers.

The Homeric poems describe the Acheron as a river of Hades, into which Cocytus and Phlegethon both flowed.

The Roman poet Virgil called the Acheron the principal river of Tartarus, from which the Styx and the Cocytus both sprang. The newly dead would be ferried across the Acheron by Charon in order to enter the Underworld. 
The Suda describes the river as &quot;a place of healing, not a place of punishment, cleansing and purging the sins of humans&quot;.

According to later traditions, Acheron had been a son of Helios and either Gaia or Demeter, who was turned into the Underworld river bearing his name after he refreshed the Titans with drink during their contest with Zeus. By this myth, Acheron is also the father of Ascalaphus by either Orphne or Gorgyra.

The river called Acheron with the nearby ruins of the Necromanteion (oratory of the dead) is found near Parga on the mainland of Greece opposite Corfu. Another branch of Acheron was believed to surface at the Acherusian cape (now Karadeniz Ereğli in Turkey) and was seen by the Argonauts according to Apollonius of Rhodes. Greeks who settled in Italy identified the Acherusian lake into which Acheron flowed with Lake Avernus. Plato in his &quot;Phaedo&quot; identified Acheron as the second greatest river in the world, excelled only by Oceanus.
He claimed that Acheron flowed in the opposite direction from Oceanus beneath the earth under desert places. The word is also occasionally used as a synecdoche for Hades itself. Virgil mentions Acheron with the other infernal rivers in his description of the underworld in Book VI of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. In Book VII, line 312 he gives to Juno the famous saying, &quot;flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo&quot;: &#x27;If I cannot bend the will of Heaven, I shall move Hell.&#x27; The same words were used by Sigmund Freud as the dedicatory motto for his seminal book &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;, figuring Acheron as psychological underworld beneath the conscious mind.

The Acheron was sometimes referred to as a lake or swamp in Greek literature, as in Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;The Frogs&quot; and Euripides&#x27; &quot;Alcestis&quot;.

In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, the Acheron river forms the border of Hell. Following Greek mythology, Charon ferries souls across this river to Hell. Those who were neutral in life sit on the banks.

== In culture ==
* In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, Charon ferries newly deceased sinners across Acheron.
* In Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play, &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus,&quot; Acheron is mentioned in Act I, scene iii, wherein Doctor Faustus conjures Mephistophiles: &quot;Sint mihi dei Acherontis propitii,&quot; or &quot;May the gods of Hell (Acheron) be propitious unto me.&quot;
* In Shakespeare&#x27;s play, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, Acheron is referenced as a euphemism for the gates of hell by Hecate in Act III, scene v: &quot;Get you gone, and at the pit of Acheron meet me i&#x27; th&#x27; morning.

==Namesake==
Acheron Lake in Antarctica is named after the mythical river.

Several ships have been named &quot;HMS Acheron&quot;.

There is a stream named the &quot;Dry Acheron&quot; in Canterbury, New Zealand.

The Eocene turtle genus &quot;Acherontemys&quot; of the Roslyn Formation in North America was named in reference to the Acheron mythos.

In &quot;&quot;, a character within the story nicknames herself after the river Acheron.

<text>Johns Frederick (Jeff) Rulifson (born August 20, 1941) is an American computer scientist.

==Early life and education==
Johns Frederick Rulifson was born August 20, 1941, in Bellefontaine, Ohio. His father was Erwin Charles Rulifson and mother was Virginia Helen Johns. Rulifson married Janet Irving on June 8, 1963, and had two children. He received a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Washington in 1966. Rulifson earned a Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University in 1973.

==Career==
Rulifson joined the Augmentation Research Center, at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) in 1966, working on a form of software called “timesharing”. He led the software team that implemented the oN-Line System (NLS), a system that foreshadowed many future developments in modern computing and networking. Specifically, Rulifson developed the command language for the NLS, among other features. His first job was to create the first display-based on the CDC 3100, and the programs he wrote included the first online editor. He also redesigned its file structure. Rulifson was also lead programmer and wrote the program and demonstration files for the first public demonstration of the computer mouse in 1968. He was also the chief programmer of the first use of hypertext. Although Douglas Engelbart was the founder and leader of ARC, Rulifson&#x27;s innovative programming was essential to the realization of Engelbart&#x27;s vision. Rulifson was also involved in the development of NIL.
Rulifson was the SRI&#x27;s representative to the &quot;network working group&quot; in 1968, which led to the first connection on the ARPANET. He described the Decode-Encode Language (DEL), which was designed to allow remote use of NLS over ARPANET. Although never used, the idea was small &quot;programs&quot; would be down-loaded to enhance user interaction. This concept was fully developed in Sun Microsystems&#x27;s Java programming language almost 30 years later, as applets. Simultaneously, he was involved in the development of the AI programming language QA4. This system was used for the planning done by Shakey, one of the first robots.

He left SRI to join the System Sciences Laboratory (SSL) within Xerox PARC in 1973. Here he began work on personal computing and the creation of local networks. One of his first actions was to develop the concept for the desktop icon. By 1978 he was the manager of the center&#x27;s Office Research Group, where he introduced the use of interdisciplinary scholars into the group&#x27;s work. Specifically, he was the first computer scientist to begin working alongside anthropologists, hiring several at Xerox to improve their use of field research and enter the field of social science research.

At PARC, he worked on implementing distributed office systems. In 1980, he worked for ROLM as an engineering manager and joined Syntelligence, an artificial intelligence applications vendor in Sunnyvale, California, in 1985. He began working for Sun Microsystems Laboratories in 1987, and held positions including as a director of engineering, technology development, and research groups. He then managed Ivan Sutherland&#x27;s lab from 2003 until his retirement. He is an emeritus board member of the Doug Engelbart Institute and Chairman of The Open Group.

Jeff Rulifsons papers and research from 1956 to 1997 are held at the Computer History Museum, with a guide to his work entitled Guide to the Jeff Rulifson papers, written by Bo Doub, Kim Hayden, and Sara Chabino Lott.

==Awards==
In 1990, Rulifson won the Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s Software System Award for implementing groundbreaking innovations such as hypertext, outline processors, and video conferencing. In 1994, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, for his “pioneering work on augmenting human intellect with hypertext, outline processors, and video conferencing.” In 2006 Rulifson was named to the SRI International Hall of Fame.

<text>Dial M for Murder is a 1954 American crime thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings, Anthony Dawson, and John Williams. Both the screenplay and the successful stage play on which it was based were written by English playwright Frederick Knott. The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television, before being performed on stage in the same year in London&#x27;s West End in June, and then New York&#x27;s Broadway in October.

Originally intended to be shown in dual-strip polarized 3-D, the film played in most cinemas in ordinary 2-D owing to the loss of interest in the 3-D process (the projection of which was difficult and error-prone) by the time of its release. The film earned an estimated $2.7 million in North American box office sales in 1954.

==Plot==
The setting is the mid-1950s. Tony Wendice, a retired English professional tennis player, is married to wealthy socialite Margot, who has been having an affair with Mark Halliday, an American crime-fiction writer. Unbeknownst to them, Tony knows about the affair and plots Margot&#x27;s murder to inherit her fortune, fearing a divorce would leave him penniless.

Tony is also aware that Charles Swann, an old acquaintance from Cambridge University, is a small-time con man with a criminal record. Tony invites Swann to his Maida Vale flat on a pretext and tells him about Margot&#x27;s affair. Tony also confides that six months previously he had stolen Margot&#x27;s handbag, which contained a love letter from Mark, and had anonymously blackmailed her. After tricking Swann into leaving his fingerprints on the letter, Tony entraps him, threatening to turn him in as Margot&#x27;s blackmailer unless he kills Margot. With the added inducement of £1,000 in cash, Swann agrees to the murder. Tony then explains that he and Mark will attend a party while Margot stays at home alone. At a specific time when Margot is certain to be in bed, Swann will enter the front door of the building, which is always unlocked, and will enter the locked door of the flat with Margot&#x27;s latchkey, which Tony will hide on the staircase under a carpet. Tony will then telephone the flat from the party and Swann will kill Margot when she answers the call. Swann will whistle over the phone to signal the job is done, then create signs of a burglary gone wrong and put the key back under the staircase carpet as he is leaving the building.

The following night Swann enters the flat and Tony rings as planned. When Margot comes to the phone, Swann tries to strangle her with his scarf, but she fatally stabs him with scissors. Upon hearing Margot plead for help instead of Swann&#x27;s whistle, Tony advises her not to speak to anyone. He returns home, calls the police, sends Margot to bed and transfers what he thinks is Margot&#x27;s key from Swann&#x27;s pocket into her handbag. He also attempts to frame Margot by planting Mark&#x27;s letter on Swann and destroying Swann&#x27;s scarf.

The next day, Tony persuades Margot not to reveal that he told her not to call the police. Chief Inspector Hubbard arrives to question the Wendices, and Margot makes several conflicting statements. When Hubbard says the evidence indicates that Swann entered through the front door, Tony claims that Swann must have been responsible for stealing Margot&#x27;s handbag, and made a copy of her key. As Tony intends, Hubbard does not believe the story and arrests Margot after concluding that she killed Swann for blackmailing her. At her trial, Margot is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.

Months later, on the day before Margot&#x27;s scheduled execution, Mark visits Tony, saying he has devised a story for him to tell the police to save Margot. Mark&#x27;s &quot;story&quot; is very close to what actually happened: that Tony paid Swann to kill Margot. If Tony confesses to Mark’s story, Tony would go to jail for a while, but Margot would be saved. Hubbard arrives unexpectedly, and Mark hides in the bedroom. Hubbard asks Tony about large sums of cash he has been spending around town, tricks Tony into revealing that his latchkey is in his raincoat, and inquires about Tony&#x27;s attaché case. Tony claims to have misplaced the case, but Mark, overhearing the conversation, finds it on the bed, full of banknotes. Deducing that the money was Tony&#x27;s intended payoff to Swann, Mark confronts Tony and explains his theory to Hubbard. Tony &quot;confesses&quot; that the cash was Margot&#x27;s blackmail payment to Swann, which he had concealed to protect her. Hubbard appears to accept Tony&#x27;s explanation, and Mark leaves angrily. Hubbard discreetly swaps his own raincoat with Tony&#x27;s. As soon as Tony leaves, Hubbard uses Tony&#x27;s key to re-enter the flat, followed by Mark. Hubbard had previously discovered that the key in Margot&#x27;s handbag was Swann&#x27;s own latchkey and deduced that Swann had put the Wendices&#x27; key back in its hiding place after unlocking the door. Now, correctly suspecting Tony of having conspired with Swann, Hubbard has developed an elaborate ruse to trap him.

Plain clothes police officers bring Margot from prison to the flat. She tries unsuccessfully to unlock the door with the key in her handbag, then enters through the garden, proving to Hubbard that she is unaware of the hidden key and is therefore innocent. Hubbard has Margot&#x27;s handbag returned to the police station, where Tony retrieves it after discovering that he has no key. The key from Margot&#x27;s bag does not work, so he uses the hidden key to open the door, demonstrating his guilt and exonerating Margot. With his escape routes blocked by Hubbard and another policeman, Tony calmly makes himself a drink and congratulates Hubbard.

==Production==
After &quot;I Confess&quot; (1953), Hitchcock planned to film &quot;The Bramble Bush&quot;, based on the 1948 novel by David Duncan, as a Transatlantic Pictures production, with partner Sidney Bernstein. However, there were problems with the script and budget, and Hitchcock and Bernstein decided to dissolve their partnership. Warner Bros. allowed Hitchcock to scrap the film, and begin production on &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;.

According to his biographer Donald Spoto, Hitchcock was not enthusiastic about the film, and Spoto quotes Grace Kelly to the effect that &quot;the only reason [Hitchcock] could remain calm was that he was already preparing his next picture, &quot;Rear Window&quot;&quot;.

Mark&#x27;s name was changed for the film; in the original play, he was Max Halliday. Actors Dawson and Williams reprise their Broadway roles as Swann/Captain Lesgate and Inspector Hubbard, respectively.

Cummings had previously made &quot;Saboteur&quot; for Hitchcock.

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, he can be seen thirteen minutes into the film, in a black-and-white reunion photograph, sitting at a banquet table among former students and faculty.

==Release==
&quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; was shot using Warner Bros.&#x27; own proprietary 3-D camera rig, the so-called All-Media Camera. After one preview performance on May 18 and four showings on the May 19, a Philadelphia theater manager frantically contacted the studio and said that people were staying away in droves. He asked for permission to drop the 3-D and show the film flat.

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported on May 23 that the &quot;first audiences proved to be a jury that could not only make up its mind, but could make it up in a hurry. In exhibitors&#x27; own terms, ‘DIAL M’ literally died. And after just four performances on Wednesday, some long-distance telephoning to report complaints, the increasing skimpiness of customers—a good many of them making no bones of their dissatisfaction—permission was given to throw away the glasses and hastily switch to the 2-D version. Whereupon business at the Randolph took a turn for the better.&quot;

&quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; marked the end of the brief flirtation with 3-D films of the early 1950s. Hitchcock said of 3-D: &quot;It&#x27;s a nine-day wonder, and I came in on the ninth day.&quot;

The dual-strip system was used for the February 1980 revival of the film in 3D at the York Theater in San Francisco, California. This revival performed so well that Warner Bros. did a limited national re-release of the film in February 1982 using Chris Condon&#x27;s single-strip StereoVision 3-D system. The re-release included a sold-out engagement at the Detroit Institute of Arts.

The film was shown in 3D in some UK cinemas during the summer of 2013 and in Italy at the beginning of fall of the same year.

Warner Bros. released &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; as a 3D Blu-ray on October 9, 2012.

==Reception==
&quot;This is a technical triumph that Hitchcock has achieved&quot;, wrote Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in a favourable review. &quot;It is one for which he needed good actors. He has them—and the best of the lot is John Williams, late of the stage play, who is the detective who solves the sinister ruse.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;There are a number of basic weaknesses in the set-up that keep the picture from being a good suspense show for any but the most gullible. Via the performances and several suspense tricks expected of Hitchcock, the weaknesses are glossed over to some extent but not enough to rate the film a cinch winner.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote that the film &quot;shapes up as no more than a mild entertainment, despite the expert direction of Hitchcock and the competent acting of the players. The chief weakness is that the action is slow, caused by the fact that the story unfolds almost entirely by dialogue.&quot;

Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;completely choice&quot;, with Williams and Dawson &quot;smooth as silk in reprising their stage roles&quot;, adding, &quot;Hitch has a field day with his camera angles, darting our eyes now here, now there, doing tingling tricks with shadows and long longshots in quick contrast to fuzzed close-ups. It&#x27;s the work of a master enjoying his script.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote a generally positive review, writing that he wished the script would give Hitchcock &quot;a chance to cut loose with one of those spectacular chases he used to specialise in&quot;, but finding that after a talky opening 30 minutes, &quot;things speed up once the murder wheels are set in motion, and eventually the piece becomes grimly diverting&quot;. &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that the film &quot;offers the prolific Hitchcock little more than an opportunity to carpenter a neat piece of filmed theatre—an opportunity which perhaps satisfied the master a little more than it does us ... The characters are fitted to their situations, and hardly exist in themselves (nor are they enlivened by the rather drab performances of Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings); only John Williams&#x27; dry, sardonic police inspector has a touch of individuality.&quot;

 In 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the film &quot;a taut, acidly funny thriller&quot;.

The film was listed by American Film Institute in 2001 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills (#48), and in 2008 in AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 (#9 in Mysteries).

==Adaptations and references==

=== Stage ===
As it is considered one of the classic examples of a stage thriller, &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; has been adapted a number of times. The New Vic Theatre staged a production of the play in its main house (in the round) in 2017. It was directed by Peter Leslie Wild, and the cast featured William Ellis as Tony. The play received positive press reviews.

In 2022, another stage adaptation of &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; written by Jeffrey Hatcher and approved by the Knott estate opened at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, California. Hatcher kept the original setting of 1950s London but changed the character of &quot;Max Halliday&quot; to &quot;Maxine Hadley,&quot; making the love affair with Margot a lesbian one. That and other changes garnered critical praise. The adaptation has enjoyed many productions since its premiere.

=== Film ===
The film partially inspired a Hindi-language version in 1985, released as &quot;Aitbaar&quot;, starring Raj Babbar, Dimple Kapadia and Suresh Oberoi. A Tamil-language adaptation, titled &quot;Saavi&quot;, with Sathyaraj, Saritha, Jaishankar and Nizhalgal Ravi, was released in the same year. The film also inspired a Malayalam-language adaptation as &quot;New Year&quot; starring Jayaram, Urvashi and Suresh Gopi in 1989.

&quot;A Perfect Murder&quot; is a 1998 remake directed by Andrew Davis in which the characters of Halliday and Swann are combined, with the husband (Michael Douglas) both hiring and coercing his wife&#x27;s lover (played by Viggo Mortensen) into committing a contract killing of her (Gwyneth Paltrow).

The 2002 Bollywood film &quot;Humraaz&quot; starring Bobby Deol, Akshaye Khanna, and Amisha Patel, was in turn inspired by &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot;.

The 2001 Pakistani film &quot;Khoey Ho Tum Kahan&quot; is based on the film.

=== Television ===
The television series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; premiered in the United States the year after &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; was released. The main character in an episode from the series&#x27;s first season, &quot;Portrait of Jocelyn&quot;, is named Mark Halliday. In the episode, Halliday&#x27;s wife, Jocelyn, has disappeared several years earlier, and at the conclusion, it is revealed that he murdered her.

In 1956, NBC aired a television film in which Maurice Evans (as Tony), Williams and Dawson all repeated their roles from the original Broadway play. ABC produced a two-hour color version in 1967 featuring Laurence Harvey as Tony, Diane Cilento as Margot and Hugh O&#x27;Brian as Max.

The episode &quot;The Fifth Stair&quot; of the TV series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; recreated &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, with Richard Long portraying Tony Wendice.

A US TV film 1981 with Angie Dickinson and Christopher Plummer aired in 1981. &quot;&quot; (Ошибка Тони Вендиса), based on the stage play version of &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, aired in on TV in the Soviet Union in 1981.

The third episode of the sixth season of &quot;Frasier&quot; is titled &quot;Dial M for Martin&quot;. The plot centres on the title character&#x27;s father believing that his younger son is subconsciously trying to kill him when he is beset by a series of mishaps seemingly caused by Frasier&#x27;s younger brother, Niles.

The season 1 finale of the TV series &quot;Archer&quot; is titled &quot;Dial M for Mother&quot; in reference to the film. In the episode, Sterling Archer is given a brain implant, which makes him subconsciously want to kill his mother Malory.

<text>Microsoft PowerPoint is a presentation program, created by Robert Gaskins, Tom Rudkin, and Dennis Austin at a software company named Forethought, Inc. It was released on April 20, 1987, initially for Macintosh computers only. Microsoft acquired PowerPoint for about $14 million three months after it appeared. This was Microsoft&#x27;s first significant acquisition, and Microsoft set up a new business unit for PowerPoint in Silicon Valley where Forethought had been located.

PowerPoint became a component of the Microsoft Office suite, first offered in 1989 for Macintosh and in 1990 for Windows, which bundled several Microsoft apps. Beginning with PowerPoint 4.0 (1994), PowerPoint was integrated into Microsoft Office development, and adopted shared common components and a converged user interface.

PowerPoint&#x27;s market share was very small at first, prior to introducing a version for Microsoft Windows, but grew rapidly with the growth of Windows and of Office. Since the late 1990s, PowerPoint&#x27;s worldwide market share of presentation software has been estimated at 95 percent.

PowerPoint was originally designed to provide visuals for group presentations within business organizations, but has come to be widely used in other communication situations in business and beyond. The wider use led to the development of the PowerPoint presentation as a new form of communication, with strong reactions including advice that it should be used less, differently, or better.

The first PowerPoint version (Macintosh 1987) was used to produce overhead transparencies, the second (Macintosh 1988, Windows 1990) could also produce color 35 mm slides. The third version (Windows and Macintosh 1992) introduced video output of virtual slideshows to digital projectors, which would over time replace physical transparencies and slides. A dozen major versions since then have added additional features and modes of operation and have made PowerPoint available beyond Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows, adding versions for iOS, Android, and web access.

==History==
===Creation at Forethought (1984–1987)===
PowerPoint was created by Robert Gaskins and Dennis Austin at a software startup in Silicon Valley named Forethought, Inc. Forethought had been founded in 1983 to create an integrated environment and applications for future personal computers that would provide a graphical user interface, but it had run into difficulties requiring a &quot;restart&quot; and new plan.

On July 5, 1984, Forethought hired Robert Gaskins as its vice president of product development to create a new application that would be especially suited to the new graphical personal computers, such as the Apple Macintosh and later Microsoft Windows. Gaskins produced his initial description of PowerPoint about a month later (August 14, 1984) in the form of a 2-page document titled &quot;Presentation Graphics for Overhead Projection.&quot; By October 1984, Gaskins had selected Dennis Austin to be the developer for PowerPoint. Gaskins and Austin worked together on the definition and design of the new product for nearly a year, and produced the first specification document dated August 21, 1985. This first design document showed a product as it would look in Microsoft Windows 1.0, which at that time had not been released.

Development from that spec was begun by Austin in November 1985, for Macintosh first. About six months later, on May 1, 1986, Gaskins and Austin chose a second developer to join the project, Thomas Rudkin. Gaskins prepared two final product specification marketing documents in June 1986; these described a product for both Macintosh and Windows. At about the same time, Austin, Rudkin, and Gaskins produced a second and final major design specification document, this time showing a Macintosh look.

Throughout this development period, the product was called &quot;Presenter&quot;. Then, just before release, there was a last-minute check with Forethought&#x27;s lawyers to register the name as a trademark, and &quot;Presenter&quot; was unexpectedly rejected because it had already been used by someone else. Gaskins says that he thought of &quot;PowerPoint&quot;, based on the product&#x27;s goal of &quot;empowering&quot; individual presenters, and sent that name to the lawyers for clearance, while all the documentation was hastily revised.

Funding to complete development of PowerPoint was assured in mid-January 1987, when a new Apple Computer venture capital fund, called Apple&#x27;s Strategic Investment Group, selected PowerPoint to be its first investment. A month later, on February 22, 1987, Forethought announced PowerPoint at the Personal Computer Forum in Phoenix; John Sculley, the CEO of Apple, appeared at the announcement and said &quot;We see desktop presentation as potentially a bigger market for Apple than desktop publishing.&quot;

PowerPoint 1.0 for Macintosh shipped from manufacturing on April 20, 1987, and the first production run of 10,000 units was sold out.

===Acquisition by Microsoft (1987–1992)===
By early 1987, Microsoft was starting to plan a new application to create presentations, an activity led by Jeff Raikes, who was head of marketing for the Applications Division. Microsoft assigned an internal group to write a specification and plan for a new presentation product. They contemplated an acquisition to speed up development, and in early 1987 Microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire Dave Winer&#x27;s product called MORE, an outlining program that could print its outlines as bullet charts. During this preparatory activity Raikes discovered that a program specifically to make overhead presentations was already being developed by Forethought, Inc., and that it was nearly completed. Raikes and others visited Forethought on February 6, 1987, for a confidential demonstration.

Raikes later recounted his reaction to seeing PowerPoint and his report about it to Bill Gates, who was initially skeptical:

When PowerPoint was released by Forethought, its initial press was favorable; the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported on early reactions: I see about one product a year I get this excited about,&#x27; says Amy hora, a consultant in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. &#x27;People will buy a Macintosh just to get access to this product.

On April 28, 1987, a week after shipment, a group of Microsoft&#x27;s senior executives spent another day at Forethought to hear about initial PowerPoint sales on Macintosh and plans for Windows. The following day, Microsoft sent a letter to Dave Winer withdrawing its earlier letter of intent to acquire his company, and in mid-May 1987 Microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire Forethought. As requested in that letter of intent, Robert Gaskins from Forethought went to Redmond for a one-on-one meeting with Bill Gates in early June 1987, and by the end of July an agreement was concluded for an acquisition. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported:

Microsoft&#x27;s president Jon Shirley offered his company&#x27;s motivation for the acquisition: We made this deal primarily because of our belief in desktop presentations as a product category. ... Forethought was first to market with a product in this category. Microsoft had 50% market share in Macintosh applications, and led in three categories; Raikes said that after the acquisition it would lead in five categories. (Forethought distributed the database Filemaker, which Microsoft wanted to continue marketing.) The company intended for Forethought to be its Silicon Valley base to develop and market future graphics software, so set up within its Applications Division, an independent &quot;Graphics Business Unit&quot; for PowerPoint, the first Microsoft application group distant from the main Redmond location. The company hoped to hire employees uninterested in living in Washington state. All the PowerPoint people from Forethought joined Microsoft, and the new location was headed by Robert Gaskins, with Dennis Austin and Thomas Rudkin leading development. PowerPoint 1.0 for Macintosh was modified to indicate the new Microsoft ownership and continued to be sold. A year after the acquisition, Gaskins reported that all seven Forethought PowerPoint employees had stayed with Microsoft, and the Graphics Business Unit had hired 12 employees, many of whom did not want to move to Redmond. The GBU had moved to a new location on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California; it was much larger than needed for 19 people, but Gaskins wrote that he and Microsoft wanted future capacity as the company grew in Silicon Valley.

A new PowerPoint 2.0 for Macintosh, adding color 35 mm slides, shipped in May 1988, and again received good reviews. The same PowerPoint 2.0 product re-developed for Windows was shipped two years later, in mid-1990, at the same time as Windows 3.0. Much of the color technology was the result of a joint development partnership with Genigraphics, the dominant presentation services company.

PowerPoint 3.0, which was shipped in 1992 for both Windows and Mac, added live video for projectors and monitors, with the result that PowerPoint was thereafter used for delivering presentations as well as for preparing them. This was at first an alternative to overhead transparencies and 35 mm slides, but over time would come to replace them.

===Part of Microsoft Office (since 1993)===

PowerPoint had been included in Microsoft Office from the beginning. PowerPoint 2.0 for Macintosh was part of the first Office bundle for Macintosh which was offered in mid-1989. When PowerPoint 2.0 for Windows appeared, a year later, it was part of a similar Office bundle for Windows, which was offered in late 1990. Both of these were bundling promotions, in which the independent applications were packaged together and offered for a lower total price.

PowerPoint 3.0 (1992) was again separately specified and developed, and was advertised and sold separately from Office. It was, as before, included in Microsoft Office 3.0, both for Windows and the corresponding version for Macintosh.

A plan to integrate the applications themselves more tightly had been indicated as early as February 1991, toward the end of PowerPoint 3.0 development, in an internal memo by Bill Gates:

The move from bundling separate products to integrated development began with PowerPoint 4.0, developed in 1993–1994 under new management from Redmond. The PowerPoint group in Silicon Valley was reorganized from the independent &quot;Graphics Business Unit&quot; (GBU) to become the &quot;Graphics Product Unit&quot; (GPU) for Office, and PowerPoint 4.0 changed to adopt a converged user interface and other components shared with the other apps in Office.

When it was released, the computer press reported on the change approvingly: &quot;PowerPoint 4.0 has been re-engineered from the ground up to resemble and work with the latest applications in Office: Word 6.0, Excel 5.0, and Access 2.0. The integration is so good, you&#x27;ll have to look twice to make sure you&#x27;re running PowerPoint and not Word or Excel.&quot; Office integration was further underscored in the following version, PowerPoint 95, which was given the version number PowerPoint 7.0 (skipping 5.0 and 6.0) so that all the components of Office would share the same major version number.

Although PowerPoint by this point had become part of the integrated Microsoft Office product, its development remained in Silicon Valley. Succeeding versions of PowerPoint introduced important changes, particularly version 12.0 (2007) which had a very different shared Office &quot;ribbon&quot; user interface, and a new shared Office XML-based file format. This marked the 20th anniversary of PowerPoint, and Microsoft held an event to commemorate that anniversary at its Silicon Valley Campus for the PowerPoint team there. Special guests were Robert Gaskins, Dennis Austin, and Thomas Rudkin, and the featured speaker was Jeff Raikes, all from PowerPoint 1.0 days, 20 years before.

Since then major development of PowerPoint as part of Office has continued. New development techniques (shared across Office) for PowerPoint 2016 have made it possible to ship versions of PowerPoint 2016 for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and web access nearly simultaneously, and to release new features on an almost monthly schedule. PowerPoint development is still carried out in Silicon Valley .

In 2010, Jeff Raikes, who had most recently been President of the Business Division of Microsoft (including responsibility for Office), observed: &quot;of course, today we know that PowerPoint is oftentimes the number two—or in some cases even the number one—most-used tool&quot; among the applications in Office.

===Sales and market share===
PowerPoint&#x27;s initial sales were about 40,000 copies sold in 1987 (nine months), about 85,000 copies in 1988, and about 100,000 copies in 1989, all for Macintosh. PowerPoint&#x27;s market share in its first three years was a tiny part of the total presentation market, which was very heavily dominated by MS-DOS applications on PCs. The market leaders on MS-DOS in 1988–1989 were Harvard Graphics (introduced by Software Publishing in 1986) in first place, and Lotus Freelance Plus (also introduced in 1986) as a strong second. They were competing with more than a dozen other MS-DOS presentation products, and Microsoft did not develop a PowerPoint version for MS-DOS. After three years, PowerPoint sales were disappointing. Jeff Raikes, who had bought PowerPoint for Microsoft, later recalled: &quot;By 1990, it looked like it wasn&#x27;t a very smart idea [for Microsoft to have acquired PowerPoint], because not very many people were using PowerPoint.&quot;

This began to change when the first version for Windows, PowerPoint 2.0, brought sales up to about 200,000 copies in 1990 and to about 375,000 copies in 1991, with Windows units outselling Macintosh. PowerPoint sold about 1 million copies in 1992, of which about 80 percent were for Windows and about 20 percent for Macintosh, and in 1992 PowerPoint&#x27;s market share of worldwide presentation graphics software sales was reported as 63 percent. By the last six months of 1992, PowerPoint revenue was running at a rate of over $100 million annually ($ in present-day terms).

Sales of PowerPoint 3.0 doubled to about 2 million copies in 1993, of which about 90 percent were for Windows and about 10 percent for Macintosh, and in 1993 PowerPoint&#x27;s market share of worldwide presentation graphics software sales was reported as 78 percent. In both years, about half of total revenue came from sales outside the U.S.

By 1997 PowerPoint sales had doubled again, to more than 4 million copies annually, representing 85 percent of the world market. Also in 1997, an internal publication from the PowerPoint group said that by then over 20 million copies of PowerPoint were in use, and that total revenues from PowerPoint over its first ten years (1987 to 1996) had already exceeded $1 billion.

Since the late 1990s, PowerPoint&#x27;s market share of total world presentation software has been estimated at 95 percent by both industry and academic sources.

==Operation==
The earliest version of PowerPoint (1987 for Macintosh) could be used to print black and white pages to be photocopied onto sheets of transparent film for projection from overhead projectors, and to print speaker&#x27;s notes and audience handouts; the next version (1988 for Macintosh, 1990 for Windows) was extended to also produce color 35mm slides by communicating a file over a modem to a Genigraphics imaging center with slides returned by overnight delivery for projection from slide projectors. PowerPoint was used for planning and preparing a presentation, but not for delivering it (apart from previewing it on a computer screen, or distributing printed paper copies). The operation of PowerPoint changed substantially in its third version (1992 for Windows and Macintosh), when PowerPoint was extended to also deliver a presentation by producing direct video output to digital projectors or large monitors. In 1992 video projection of presentations was rare and expensive, and practically unknown from a laptop computer. Robert Gaskins, one of the creators of PowerPoint, says he publicly demonstrated that use for the first time at a large Microsoft meeting held in Paris on February 25, 1992, by using an unreleased development build of PowerPoint 3.0 running on an early pre-production sample of a powerful new color laptop and feeding a professional auditorium video projector.

By about 2003, ten years later, digital projection had become the dominant mode of use, replacing transparencies and 35mm slides and their projectors. As a result, the meaning of &quot;PowerPoint presentation&quot; narrowed to mean specifically digital projection:

In contemporary operation, PowerPoint is used to create a file (called a &quot;presentation&quot; or &quot;deck&quot;) containing a sequence of pages (called &quot;slides&quot; in the app) which usually have a consistent style (from template masters), and which may contain information imported from other apps or created in PowerPoint, including text, bullet lists, tables, charts, drawn shapes, images, audio clips, video clips, animations of elements, and animated transitions between slides, plus attached notes for each slide.

After such a file is created, typical operation is to present it as a slide show using a portable computer, where the presentation file is stored on the computer or available from a network, and the computer&#x27;s screen shows a &quot;presenter view&quot; with current slide, next slide, speaker&#x27;s notes for the current slide, and other information. Video is sent from the computer to one or more external digital projectors or monitors, showing only the current slide to the audience, with sequencing controlled by the speaker at the computer. A smartphone remote control built in to PowerPoint for iOS (optionally controlled from Apple Watch) and for Android allows the presenter to control the show from elsewhere in the room.

In addition to a computer slide show projected to a live audience by a speaker, PowerPoint can be used to deliver a presentation in a number of other ways:

* Displayed on the screen of the presentation computer or tablet (for a very small group)
* Printed for distribution as paper documents (in several formats)
* Distributed as files for private viewing, even on computers without PowerPoint
* Packaged for distribution on CD or a network, including linked and embedded data
* Transmitted as a live broadcast presentation over the web 
* Embedded in a web page or blog 
* Shared on social networks such as Facebook or Twitter 
* Set up as a self-running unattended display 
* Recorded as video/audio (H.264/AAC), to be distributed as for any other video

Some of these ways of using PowerPoint have been studied by JoAnne Yates and Wanda Orlikowski of the MIT Sloan School of Management:

They found that some of these ways of using PowerPoint could influence the content of presentations, for example when &quot;the slides themselves have to carry more of the substance of the presentation, and thus need considerably more content than they would have if they were intended for projection by a speaker who would orally provide additional details and nuance about content and context.&quot;

== Other platforms ==
===PowerPoint for mobile===
PowerPoint Mobile is included with Windows Mobile 5.0. It is a presentation program capable of reading and editing Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, although authoring abilities are limited to adding notes, editing text, and rearranging slides. It can&#x27;t create new presentations. Versions of PowerPoint Mobile for Windows Phone 7 can also watch presentation broadcasts streamed from the Internet. In 2015, Microsoft released PowerPoint Mobile for Windows 10 as a universal app. In this version of PowerPoint users can create and edit new presentations, present, and share their PowerPoint documents.

===PowerPoint for the web===

PowerPoint for the web is a free lightweight version of Microsoft PowerPoint available as part of Office on the web, which also includes web versions of Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word.

PowerPoint for the web does not support inserting or editing charts, equations, or audio or video stored on your PC, but they are all displayed in the presentation if they were added in using a desktop app. Some elements, like WordArt effects or more advanced animations and transitions, are not displayed at all, although they are preserved in the document. PowerPoint for the web also lacks the Outline, Master, Slide Sorter, and Presenter views present in the desktop app, as well as having limited printing options.

==Cultural impact==
===Business uses===
PowerPoint was originally targeted just for business presentations. Robert Gaskins, who was responsible for its design, has written about his intended customers: &quot;... I did not target other existing large groups of users of presentations, such as school teachers or military officers. ... I also did not plan to target people who were not existing users of presentations ... such as clergy and school children ... . Our focus was purely on business users, in small and large companies, from one person to the largest multinationals.&quot; Business people had for a long time made presentations for sales calls and for internal company communications, and PowerPoint produced the same formats in the same style and for the same purposes.

PowerPoint use in business grew over its first five years (1987–1992) to sales of about 1 million copies annually, for worldwide market share of 63 percent. Over the following five years (1992–1997) PowerPoint sales accelerated, to a rate of about 4 million copies annually, for worldwide market share of 85 percent. The increase in business use has been attributed to &quot;network effects&quot;, whereby additional users of PowerPoint in a company or an industry increased its salience and value to other users.

Not everyone immediately approved of the greater use of PowerPoint for presentations, even in business. CEOs who very early were reported to discourage or ban PowerPoint presentations at internal business meetings included Lou Gerstner (at IBM, in 1993), Scott McNealy (at Sun Microsystems, in 1996), and Steve Jobs (at Apple, in 1997). But even so, Rich Gold, a scholar who studied corporate presentation use at Xerox PARC, could write in 1999: &quot;Within today&#x27;s corporation, if you want to communicate an idea ... you use PowerPoint.&quot;

===Uses beyond business===
At the same time that PowerPoint was becoming dominant in business settings, it was also being adopted for uses beyond business: &quot;Personal computing ... scaled up the production of presentations. ... The result has been the rise of presentation culture. In an information society, nearly everyone presents.&quot;

In 1998, at about the same time that Gold was pronouncing PowerPoint&#x27;s ubiquity in business, the influential Bell Labs engineer Robert W. Lucky could already write about broader uses:

Over a decade or so, beginning in the mid-1990s, PowerPoint began to be used in many communication situations, well beyond its original business presentation uses, to include teaching in schools and in universities, lecturing in scientific meetings (and preparing their related poster sessions), worshipping in churches, making legal arguments in courtrooms, displaying supertitles in theaters, driving helmet-mounted displays in spacesuits for NASA astronauts, giving military briefings, issuing governmental reports, undertaking diplomatic negotiations, writing novels, giving architectural demonstrations, prototyping website designs, creating animated video games, editing images, creating art projects, and even as a substitute for writing engineering technical reports, and as an organizing tool for writing general business documents.

By 2003, it seemed that PowerPoint was being used everywhere. Julia Keller reported for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;:

===Cultural reactions===
As uses broadened, cultural awareness of PowerPoint grew and commentary about it began to appear. &quot;With the widespread adoption of PowerPoint came complaints ... often very general statements reflecting dissatisfaction with modern media and communication practices as well as the dysfunctions of organizational culture.&quot; Indications of this awareness included increasing mentions of PowerPoint use in the &quot;Dilbert&quot; comic strips of Scott Adams, comic parodies of poor or inappropriate use such as the Gettysburg Address in PowerPoint or summaries of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; in PowerPoint, and a vast number of publications on the general subject of PowerPoint, especially about how to use it.

Out of all the analyses of PowerPoint over a quarter of a century, at least three general themes emerged as categories of reaction to its broader use: (1) &quot;Use it less&quot;: avoid PowerPoint in favor of alternatives, such as using more-complex graphics and written prose, or using nothing; (2) &quot;Use it differently&quot;: make a major change to a PowerPoint style that is simpler and pictorial, turning the presentation toward a performance, more like a Steve Jobs keynote; and (3) &quot;Use it better&quot;: retain much of the conventional PowerPoint style but learn to avoid making many kinds of mistakes that can interfere with communication.

====Use it less====

An early reaction was that the broader use of PowerPoint was a mistake, and should be reversed. An influential example of this came from Edward Tufte, an authority on information design, who has been a professor of political science, statistics, and computer science at Princeton and Yale, but is best known for his self-published books on data visualization, which have sold nearly 2 million copies as of 2014.

In 2003, he published a widely-read booklet titled &quot;The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint,&quot; revised in 2006. Tufte found a number of problems with the &quot;cognitive style&quot; of PowerPoint, many of which he attributed to the standard default style templates:

Tufte particularly advised against using PowerPoint for reporting scientific analyses, using as a dramatic example some slides made during the flight of the space shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; after it had been damaged by an accident at liftoff, slides which poorly communicated the engineers&#x27; limited understanding of what had happened. For such technical presentations, and for most occasions apart from its initial domain of sales presentations, Tufte advised against using PowerPoint at all; in many situations, according to Tufte, it would be better to substitute high-resolution graphics or concise prose documents as handouts for the audience to study and discuss, providing a great deal more detail.

Many commentators enthusiastically joined in Tufte&#x27;s vivid criticism of PowerPoint uses, and at a conference held in 2013 (a decade after Tufte&#x27;s booklet appeared) one paper claimed that &quot;Despite all the criticism about his work, Tufte can be considered as the single most influential author in the discourse on PowerPoint. ... While his approach was not rigorous from a research perspective, his articles received wide resonance with the public at large ... .&quot; There were also others who disagreed with Tufte&#x27;s assertion that the PowerPoint program reduces the quality of presenters&#x27; thoughts: Steven Pinker, professor of psychology at MIT and later Harvard, had earlier argued that &quot;If anything, PowerPoint, if used well, would ideally reflect the way we think.&quot; Pinker later reinforced this opinion: &quot;Any general opposition to PowerPoint is just dumb, ... It&#x27;s like denouncing lectures—before there were awful PowerPoint presentations, there were awful scripted lectures, unscripted lectures, slide shows, chalk talks, and so on.&quot;

Much of the early commentary, on all sides, was &quot;informal&quot; and &quot;anecdotal&quot;, because empirical research had been limited.

====Use it differently====

A second reaction to PowerPoint use was to say that PowerPoint can be used well, but only by substantially changing its style of use. This reaction is exemplified by Richard E. Mayer, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has studied cognition and learning, particularly the design of educational multimedia, and who has published more than 500 publications, including over 30 books. Mayer&#x27;s theme has been that &quot;In light of the science, it is up to us to make a fundamental shift in our thinking—we can no longer expect people to struggle to try to adapt to our PowerPoint habits. Instead, we have to change our PowerPoint habits to align with the way people learn.&quot;

Tufte had argued his judgment that the information density of text on PowerPoint slides was too low, perhaps only 40 words on a slide, leading to over-simplified messages; Mayer responded that his empirical research showed exactly the opposite, that the amount of text on PowerPoint slides was usually too high, and that even fewer than 40 words on a slide resulted in &quot;PowerPoint overload&quot; that impeded understanding during presentations.

Mayer suggested a few major changes from traditional PowerPoint formats:

* replacing brief slide titles with longer &quot;headlines&quot; expressing complete ideas;
* showing more slides but simpler ones;
* removing almost all text including nearly all bullet lists (reserving the text for the spoken narration);
* using larger, higher-quality, and more important graphics and photographs;
* removing all extraneous decoration, backgrounds, logos and identifications, everything but the essential message.

Mayer&#x27;s ideas are claimed by Carmine Gallo to have been reflected in Steve Jobs&#x27;s presentations: &quot;Mayer outlined fundamental principles of multimedia design based on what scientists know about cognitive functioning. Steve Jobs&#x27;s slides adhere to each of Mayer&#x27;s principles ... .&quot; Though not unique to Jobs, many people saw the style for the first time in Jobs&#x27;s famous product introductions. Steve Jobs would have been using Apple&#x27;s Keynote, which was designed for Jobs&#x27;s own slide shows beginning in 2003, but Gallo says that &quot;speaking like Jobs has little to do with the type of presentation software you use (PowerPoint, Keynote, etc.) ... all the techniques apply equally to PowerPoint and Keynote.&quot; Gallo adds that &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s PowerPoint has one big advantage over Apple&#x27;s Keynote presentation software—it&#x27;s everywhere ... it&#x27;s safe to say that the number of Keynote presentations is minuscule in comparison with PowerPoint. Although most presentation designers who are familiar with both formats prefer to work in the more elegant Keynote system, those same designers will tell you that the majority of their client work is done in PowerPoint.&quot;

Consistent with its association with Steve Jobs&#x27;s keynotes, a response to this style has been that it is particularly effective for &quot;ballroom-style presentations&quot; (as often given in conference center ballrooms) where a celebrated and practiced speaker addresses a large passive audience, but less appropriate for &quot;conference room-style presentations&quot; which are often recurring internal business meetings for in-depth discussion with motivated counterparts.

====Use it better====

A third reaction to PowerPoint use was to conclude that the standard style is capable of being used well, but that many small points need to be executed carefully, to avoid impeding understanding. This kind of analysis is particularly associated with Stephen Kosslyn, a cognitive neuroscientist who specializes in the psychology of learning and visual communication, and who has been head of the department of psychology at Harvard, has been Director of Stanford&#x27;s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and has published some 300 papers and 14 books.

Kosslyn presented a set of psychological principles of &quot;human perception, memory, and comprehension&quot; that &quot;appears to capture the major points of agreement among researchers.&quot; He reports that his experiments support the idea that it is not intuitive or obvious how to create effective PowerPoint presentations that conform to those agreed principles, and that even small differences that might not seem significant to a presenter can produce very different results in audiences&#x27; understanding. For this reason, Kosslyn says, users need specific education to be able to identify best ways to avoid &quot;flaws and failures&quot;:

The many &quot;flaws and failures&quot; identified were those &quot;likely to disrupt the comprehension or memory of the material.&quot; Among the most common examples were &quot;Bulleted items are not presented individually, growing the list from the top to the bottom,&quot; &quot;More than four bulleted items appear in a single list,&quot; &quot;More than two lines are used per bulleted sentence,&quot; and &quot;Words are not large enough (i.e., greater than 20 point) to be easily seen.&quot; Among audience reactions common problems reported were &quot;Speakers read word-for-word from notes or from the slides themselves,&quot; &quot;The slides contained too much material to absorb before the next slide was presented,&quot; and &quot;The main point was obscured by lots of irrelevant detail.&quot;

Kosslyn observes that these findings could help to explain why the many studies of the instructional effectiveness of PowerPoint have been inconclusive and conflicting, if there were differences in the quality of the presentations tested in different studies that went unobserved because &quot;many may feel that &#x27;good design&#x27; is intuitively clear.&quot;

In 2007 Kosslyn wrote a book about PowerPoint, in which he suggested a very large number of fairly modest changes to PowerPoint styles and gave advice on recommended ways of using PowerPoint. In a later second book about PowerPoint he suggested nearly 150 clarifying style changes (in fewer than 150 pages). Kosslyn summarizes:

In 2017, an online poll of social media users in the UK was reported to show that PowerPoint &quot;remains as popular with young tech-savvy users as it is with the Baby Boomers,&quot; with about four out of five saying that &quot;PowerPoint was a great tool for making presentations,&quot; in part because &quot;PowerPoint, with its capacity to be highly visual, bridges the wordy world of yesterday with the visual future of tomorrow.&quot;

Also in 2017, the Managerial Communication Group of MIT Sloan School of Management polled their incoming MBA students, finding that &quot;results underscore just how differently this generation communicates as compared with older workers.&quot; Fewer than half of respondents reported doing any meaningful, longer-form writing at work, and even that minority mostly did so very infrequently, but &quot;85 percent of students named producing presentations as a meaningful part of their job responsibilities. Two-thirds report that they present on a daily or weekly basis—so it&#x27;s no surprise that in-person presentations is the top skill they hope to improve.&quot; One of the researchers concluded: &quot;We&#x27;re not likely to see future workplaces with long-form writing. The trend is toward presentations and slides, and we don&#x27;t see any sign of that slowing down.&quot;

===U.S. military excess===
Use of PowerPoint by the U.S. military services began slowly, because they were invested in mainframe computers, MS-DOS PCs and specialized military-specification graphic output devices, all of which PowerPoint did not support. But because of the strong military tradition of presenting briefings, as soon as they acquired the computers needed to run it, PowerPoint became part of the U.S. military.

By 2000, ten years after PowerPoint for Windows appeared, it was already identified as an important feature of U.S. armed forces culture, in a front-page story in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;:

U.S. military use of PowerPoint may have influenced its use by armed forces of other countries: &quot;Foreign armed services also are beginning to get in on the act. &#x27;You can&#x27;t speak with the U.S. military without knowing PowerPoint,&#x27; says Margaret Hayes, an instructor at National Defense University in Washington D.C., who teaches Latin American military officers how to use the software.&quot;

After another 10 years, in 2010 (and again on its front page) the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that PowerPoint use in the military was then &quot;a military tool that has spun out of control&quot;:

The &quot;New York Times&quot; account went on to say that as a result some U.S. generals had banned the use of PowerPoint in their operations:

Several incidents, about the same time, gave wide currency to discussions by serving military officers describing excessive PowerPoint use and the organizational culture that encouraged it. In response to the &quot;New York Times&quot; story, Peter Norvig and Stephen M. Kosslyn sent a joint letter to the editor stressing the institutional culture of the military: &quot;... many military personnel bemoan the overuse and misuse of PowerPoint. ... The problem is not in the tool itself, but in the way that people use it—which is partly a result of how institutions promote misuse.&quot;

The two generals who had been mentioned in 2010 as opposing the institutional culture of excessive PowerPoint use were both in the news again in 2017, when James N. Mattis became U.S. Secretary of Defense, and H. R. McMaster was appointed as U.S. National Security Advisor.

===Artistic medium===
Musician David Byrne has been using PowerPoint as a medium for art for years, producing a book and DVD and showing at galleries his PowerPoint-based artwork. Byrne has written: &quot;I have been working with PowerPoint, the ubiquitous presentation software, as an art medium for a number of years. It started off as a joke (this software is a symbol of corporate salesmanship, or lack thereof) but then the work took on a life of its own as I realized I could create pieces that were moving, despite the limitations of the &#x27;medium.

In 2005 Byrne toured with a theater piece styled as a PowerPoint presentation. When he presented it in Berkeley, on March 8, 2005, the University of California news service reported: &quot;Byrne also defended [PowerPoint&#x27;s] appeal as more than just a business tool—as a medium for art and theater. His talk was titled &#x27;I ♥ PowerPoint&#x27;. Berkeley alumnus Bob Gaskins and Dennis Austin were in the audience. Eventually, Byrne said, PowerPoint could be the foundation for &#x27;presentational theater,&#x27; with roots in Brechtian drama and Asian puppet theater.&quot; After that performance, Byrne described it in his own online journal: &quot;Did the PowerPoint talk in Berkeley for an audience of IT legends and academics. I was terrified. The guys that originally turned PowerPoint into a program were there, what were THEY gonna think? ... [Gaskins] did tell me afterwards that he liked the PowerPoint as theater idea, which was a relief.&quot;

The expressions &quot;PowerPoint Art&quot; or &quot;pptArt&quot; are used to define a contemporary Italian artistic movement which believes that the corporate world can be a unique and exceptional source of inspiration for the artist. They say: &quot;The pptArt name refers to PowerPoint, the symbolic and abstract language developed by the corporate world which has become a universal and highly symbolic communication system beyond cultures and borders.&quot;

The wide use of PowerPoint had, by 2010, given rise to &quot; ... a subculture of PowerPoint enthusiasts [that] is teaching the old application new tricks, and may even be turning a dry presentation format into a full-fledged artistic medium,&quot; by using PowerPoint animation to create &quot;games, artworks, anime, and movies.&quot;

==PowerPoint Viewer==
PowerPoint Viewer is the name for a series of small free application programs to be used on computers without PowerPoint installed, to view, project, or print (but not create or edit) presentations.

The first version was introduced with PowerPoint 3.0 in 1992, to enable electronic presentations to be projected using conference-room computers and to be freely distributed; on Windows, it took advantage of the new feature of embedding TrueType fonts within PowerPoint presentation files to make such distribution easier. The same kind of viewer app was shipped with PowerPoint 3.0 for Macintosh, also in 1992.

Beginning with PowerPoint 2003, a feature called &quot;Package for CD&quot; automatically managed all linked video and audio files plus needed fonts when exporting a presentation to a disk or flash drive or network location, and also included a copy of a revised PowerPoint Viewer application so that the result could be presented on other PCs without installing anything.

The latest version that runs on Windows &quot;was created in conjunction with PowerPoint 2010, but it can also be used to view newer presentations created in PowerPoint 2013 and PowerPoint 2016. ... All transitions, videos and effects appear and behave the same when viewed using PowerPoint Viewer as they do when viewed in PowerPoint 2010.&quot; It supports presentations created using PowerPoint 97 and later. The latest version that runs on Macintosh is PowerPoint 98 Viewer for the Classic Mac OS and Classic Environment, for Macs supporting System 7.5 to Mac OS X Tiger (10.4). It can open presentations only from PowerPoint 3.0, 4.0, and 8.0 (PowerPoint 98), although presentations created on Mac can be opened in PowerPoint Viewer on Windows.

, the last versions of PowerPoint Viewer for all platforms have been retired by Microsoft; they are no longer available for download and no longer receive security updates. The final PowerPoint Viewer for Windows (2010) and the final PowerPoint Viewer for Classic Mac OS (1998) are available only from archives. The recommended replacements for PowerPoint Viewer: &quot;On Windows 10 PCs, download the free ... PowerPoint Mobile application from the Windows Store,&quot; and &quot;On Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 PCs, upload the file to OneDrive and view it for free using ... PowerPoint Online.&quot;

==File formats==

=== Binary (1987–2007) ===
Early versions of PowerPoint, from 1987 through 1995 (versions 1.0 through 7.0), evolved through a sequence of binary file formats, different in each version, as functionality was added. This set of formats were never documented, but an open-source &quot;libmwaw&quot; (used by LibreOffice) exists to read them.

A stable binary format (called a .ppt file, like all earlier binary formats) that was shared as the default in PowerPoint 97 through PowerPoint 2003 for Windows, and in PowerPoint 98 through PowerPoint 2004 for Mac (that is, in PowerPoint versions 8.0 through 11.0) was finally created. It was based on the Compound File Binary Format. The specification document is actively maintained and can be freely downloaded, because, although no longer the default, that binary format can be read and written by some later versions of PowerPoint, including PowerPoint 2016. After the stable binary format was adopted, versions of PowerPoint continued to be able to read and write differing file formats from earlier versions. But beginning with PowerPoint 2007 and PowerPoint 2008 for Mac (PowerPoint version 12.0), this was the only binary format available for saving; PowerPoint 2007 (version 12.0) no longer supported saving to binary file formats used earlier than PowerPoint 97 (version 8.0), ten years before.

The &quot;.pps&quot; and &quot;.ppsx&quot; file extensions are technically the same as &quot;.ppt&quot; and &quot;.pptx&quot;, except they are launched as presentation instead of for editing by default.

Binary filename extensions
* .ppt, PowerPoint 97–2003 binary presentation
* .pps, PowerPoint 97–2003 binary slide show
* .pot, PowerPoint 97–2003 binary template

Binary media types
* .ppt, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint
* .pps, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint
* .pot, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint

=== Office Open XML (since 2007) ===
The big change in PowerPoint 2007 and PowerPoint 2008 for Mac (PowerPoint version 12.0) was that the stable binary file format of 97–2003 was replaced as the default by a new zipped XML-based Office Open XML format (.pptx files). Microsoft&#x27;s explanation of the benefits of the change included: smaller file sizes, up to 75% smaller than comparable binary documents; security, through being able to identify and exclude executable macros and personal data; less chance to be corrupted than binary formats; and easier interoperability for exchanging data among Microsoft and other business applications, all while maintaining backward compatibility.

XML filename extensions
* .pptx, PowerPoint 2007 XML presentation
* .pptm, PowerPoint 2007 XML macro-enabled presentation
* .ppsx, PowerPoint 2007 XML slide show
* .ppsm, PowerPoint 2007 XML macro-enabled slide show
* .ppam, PowerPoint 2007 XML add-in
* .potx, PowerPoint 2007 XML template
* .potm, PowerPoint 2007 XML macro-enabled template

XML media types 
* .pptx, application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation
* .pptm, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint.presentation.macroEnabled.12
* .ppsx, application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.slideshow
* .ppsm, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint.slideshow.macroEnabled.12
* .ppam, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint.addin.macroEnabled.12
* .potx, application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.template
* .potm, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint.template.macroEnabled.12

The specification for the new format was published as an open standard, ECMA-376, through Ecma International Technical Committee 45 (TC45). The Ecma 376 standard was approved in December 2006, and was submitted for standardization through ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 WG4 in early 2007. The standardization process was contentious. It was approved as ISO/IEC 29500 in early 2008. Copies of the ISO/IEC standard specification are freely available, in two parts. These define two related standards known as &quot;Transitional&quot; and &quot;Strict&quot;. The two standards were progressively adopted by PowerPoint: PowerPoint version 12.0 (2007, 2008 for Mac) could read and write Transitional format, but could neither read nor write Strict format. PowerPoint version 14.0 (2010, 2011 for Mac) could read and write Transitional, and also read but not write Strict. PowerPoint version 15.0 and later (beginning 2013, 2016 for Mac) can read and write both Transitional and Strict formats. The reason for the two variants was explained by Microsoft:

The PowerPoint .pptx file format (called &quot;PresentationML&quot; for Presentation Markup Language) contains separate structures for all the complex parts of a PowerPoint presentation. The specification documents run to over six thousand pages. Because of the widespread use of PowerPoint, the standardized file formats are considered important for the long-term access to digital documents in library collections and archives, according to the U.S. Library of Congress.

PowerPoint 2013 and PowerPoint 2016 provide options to set default saving to ISO/IEC 29500 Strict format, but the initial default setting remains Transitional, for compatibility with legacy features incorporating binary data in existing documents. PowerPoint 2013 or PowerPoint 2016 will both open and save files in the former binary format (.ppt), for compatibility with older versions of the program (but not versions older than PowerPoint 97). In saving to older formats, these versions of PowerPoint will check to assure that no features have been introduced into the presentation which are incompatible with the older formats.

PowerPoint 2013 and 2016 will also save a presentation in many other file formats, including PDF format, MPEG-4 or WMV video, as a sequence of single-picture files (using image formats including GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and some older formats), and as a single presentation file in which all slides are replaced with pictures. PowerPoint will both open and save files in OpenDocument Presentation format (ODP) for compatibility.

<text>Ninḫursaĝ ( &quot;Ninḫarsang&quot;; ), sometimes transcribed Ninursag, Ninḫarsag, or Ninḫursaĝa, also known as Damgalnuna or Ninmah, was the ancient Sumerian mother goddess of the mountains, and one of the seven great deities of Sumer. She is known earliest as a nurturing or fertility goddess. Temple hymn sources identify her as the &quot;true and great lady of heaven&quot; (possibly in relation to her standing on the mountain) and kings of Lagash were &quot;nourished by Ninhursag&#x27;s milk&quot;. She is the tutelary deity to several Sumerian leaders.

Her best-known myths are &quot;Enki and Ninhursag&quot; describing her dealings with Enki resulting from his sexual exploits, and &quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot; a creation myth wherein the two deities compete to create humans. She is referenced or makes brief appearances in others as well, most notably as the mother of Ninurta in the Anzû Epic.

==Name==
Ninhursag means &quot;lady of the sacred mountain&quot; from Sumerian NIN &quot;lady&quot; and ḪAR.SAG̃ &quot;sacred mountain, foothill&quot;, possibly a reference to the site of her temple, the E-Kur (House of mountain deeps) at Eridu. She had many names including &quot;Ninmah&quot; (&quot;Great Queen&quot;); &quot;Nintu&quot; (&quot;Lady of Birth&quot;); &quot;Mamma&quot; or &quot;Mami&quot; (mother); &quot;Aruru&quot; () and &quot;Belet-Ili&quot; (mistress of the gods, Akkadian).

According to the &#x27;Ninurta&#x27;s Exploits&#x27; myth, her name was changed from Ninmah to Ninhursag by her son Ninurta. As Ninmena, according to a Babylonian investiture ritual, she placed the golden crown on the king in the &quot;Eanna&quot; temple.

Possibly included among the original mother goddesses was &quot;Damgalnuna&quot;/&quot;Diĝirmaḫ&quot; (great wife of the prince) or &quot;Damkina&quot; (, “true wife”), the consort of the god Enki.

Nintur was another name assigned to Ninhursag as a birth goddess, though sometimes she was a separate goddess entirely.

The mother goddess had many epithets including &quot;shassuru&quot; or &#x27;womb goddess&#x27;, &quot;tabsut ili&quot; &#x27;midwife of the gods&#x27;, &#x27;mother of all children&#x27; and &#x27;mother of the gods&#x27;. In this role she is identified with Ki in the Enuma Elish. She had shrines in both Eridu and Kish. It has also been speculated that she was worshipped under the name &quot;Belet-Nagar&quot; in Mari. However, it has also been proposed that the name Ninhursag in documents from Mari should be understood as a logographic writing of the name Shalash, the wife of Dagan, who was the goddess of Bitin near Alalakh rather than Nagar (modern Tell Brak) in the Khabur Triangle. Belet Nagar has alternatively been identified with Hurrian deities: Shaushka (though this proposal was met with criticism) or Nabarbi.

===Diĝirmaḫ===

Dingirmah (&quot;great goddess&quot;) was a very common epithet of Ninhursag. In older literature, the name was transcribed as dMah, but the correct reading was confirmed through the existence of a syllabically written Emesal form, Dimmermah.

Although she was originally an epithet of Ninhursag, Dingirmah eventually developed into a separate goddess at the end of the Early Dynastic period. In the Nippur god list, Dingirmah was one of the nine goddesses of birth enumerated after Šulpae, and the Isin god list similarly included her as one of six birth goddesses. Dingirmah was also present in the &quot;An = Anum&quot; god list, which listed her alongside Ninhursag, Ninmah, Aruru and Nintur. It is uncertain whether these were all regarded as variant names for the same goddess or different goddesses with similar functions.

A temple dedicated to Dingirmah, the E-maḫ, was built in Adab by a local ruler. Another temple was built at Malgium by King Ipiq-Ištar.

===Ninmaḫ===

Ninmah (&quot;great lady&quot;) was one of the most common epithets of Ninhursag alongside Dingirmah. The name was already attested in Fara and pre-Sargonian Lagash, and primarily occurred in liturgical and literary texts. An Akkadian form, Ereshmah (written syllabically as &quot;e-re-eš-ma-aḫ&quot;), was attested at Ugarit, and was either a variant or the correctly written form of the name.

Like Dingirmah, Ninmah was initially an epithet of Ninhursag who later developed into a separate goddess at the end of the Early Dynastic period. In Lagash, King Entemena built a temple that was at first dedicated to Ninhursag, and then rededicated to Ninmah.

In a text known as &quot;Archive of Mystic Heptads&quot;, Ninmah was labeled separately from Ninhursag as the &quot;Bēlet-ilī of the Emaḫ temple&quot; in an enumeration of seven goddesses of birth.

==Function==
As evidenced by the large number of names, epithets, and areas of worship associated with her cult, Ninhursag&#x27;s function in religion had many different aspects and shifted notably over time. Ninhursag was not the tutelary goddess of any major city, her cult presence being attested first in smaller towns and villages. It is possible that she was viewed originally more as a nurturing than a birth goddess. Another theory posits that, along with the goddess Nintur, she was the birth goddess of wild and domesticated animals. Her connection to the biological process of childbirth in worship is suspected to have developed later, as she began to by syncretized with other &#x27;birth-goddesses&#x27;, and took on her &quot; Bēlet-ilī&quot; name. In this birth aspect, she is called by the kings of Lagash as &quot;the midwife who suckled them&quot;. From the third Early Dynastic Period and onward, the most common Ninhursag epithets emphasize her as the supreme &quot;mother of the world&quot;. This term of mother, Julia Asher-Greve and Joan Westenholz argue, was analogous to the generic &#x27;father&#x27; used for gods such as Anu and Enki, and therefore transcends the biological concept of motherhood. Later in the Neo-Sumerian Period she became more associated with the physical process of birth. (i.e. her offerings including umbilical cord cutters). In the Old Babylonian Period some posit a decline in her worship, as she loses her high status as part of the four supreme deities of the pantheon. However Westenholz posits that her cult continued to be relevant but shifted function, as she became &quot; Bēlet-ilī&quot;.

She had a documented role in Sumerian kingship ideology. The first known royal votive gift, recovered from Kiš, was donated by a king referring to himself as ‘beloved son of Ninḫursaĝa&#x27;. Votive objects dedicated to her &quot;Diĝirmaḫ&quot; name were recovered in Adab, dating to the Early Dynastic Period.

She could also be understood not simply as affiliated with mountains, but as a personification of mountain (or earth) as well. One text in Sumerian, the &quot;Disputation between Summer and Winter&quot;, describes the creation of the seasons as a result of the copulation of Ninhursag (the earth) and Enlil. Another temple hymn from Gudea praising Ningirsu (epithet of Ninurta) describes him as having been born by a mountain range. She had a connection to the wild animals, particularly deer, who dwell on or around the mountains. Stags appear in façade on the walls of her temples, as well as in works containing the lion headed eagle, a symbol of Ninurta. One composition, a dedication of Ninhursag&#x27;s Kes temple, mentions deer, bison, and wild goats in connection to the building.

She and her other names could also appear in ritual incantations for a variety of functions, some of which include Damgalnunna to protect from evil demons, and Ninhursaga and Nintur in birth related incantation. As Ninmah she has appeared occasionally in medical texts, such as one from Sultantepe which describes a ritual and offerings to be performed for the goddess in order to cure bedwetting. It is suggested that her role in performing healing connects to that of her healing Enki in &quot;Enki and Ninhursag&quot;.

==Association with other deities==

===Family===

Ninhursag&#x27;s parentage and ancestry is not described in any known texts. In the &quot;Hymn of Adad&quot;, the eponymous storm god is referred to as Bēlet-ilī&#x27;s brother.

===Consorts and children===

Ninhursag&#x27;s most well attested consort was Šulpae, who could be described as her &quot;beloved spouse&quot;. They were attested as consorts in sources from Kesh, such as the &quot;Kesh Temple Hymn&quot;, and Nippur.

Deities who were regarded as the children of Ninhursag and Šulpae include Ashgi, Paniĝinĝarra, Lisin, Egime, and Lillu, who was possibly identical with Ashgi. Marcos Such-Gutiérrez suggests that Ashgi was initially Ninhursag&#x27;s husband in Adab due to Šulpae being sparsely attested in sources from this city from the third millennium BCE, and was only viewed as her son in later periods. Paniĝinĝarra could appear alongside his mother in sources such as greeting formulas in letters. Although Ninhursag was generally identified as Lisin&#x27;s mother, at least one text equated them with each other instead. According to the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, Lisin (who here had swapped genders) was a son of Belet-Ili. Egime resided at her mother&#x27;s Emaḫ temple in Adab, and appeared alongside Ninhursag in the lament &quot;Lulil and his sister&quot;, in which the two mourned the death of Ashgi (referred to in the text as Lulil, meaning &quot;man-spirit&quot;).

In the &quot;An = Anum&quot; god list, Ninhursag was assigned sixteen additional children besides Paniĝinĝarra, Lillu, Ashgi, and Lisin, named Atugula, Atutur, NIN.LA2, NIG-gumaḫa, Burukaš, Zarzaru, Zurmuzarmu, Nin-BUR.SAL, Šazumaḫ, Ušumšasu, Naĝaršaga, Anmea, Amaea, UR-guru, Urra, and Amaniranna. NIN.LA2 is generally accepted to be the same goddess as Egime, because NIN was glossed as &quot;e-gi&quot;, while the sign LA2 (𒇲) is believed to have been derived from ME (𒈨).

In Lagash, she was associated with Enlil as his wife, and the mother of Ningirsu (Assimilated with Ninurta.) She is Ninurta&#x27;s mother as Bēlet-ilī/Mami in Anzû and other myths as well. Some Sumerian sources identify her as both Enlil&#x27;s wife and sister, likely to rectify earlier traditions where she was Enlil&#x27;s spouse, before later traditions had the goddess Ninlil as his wife instead. After this change Ninhursag was reassigned as Enlil&#x27;s elder sister.

Enki was portrayed as Ninhursag&#x27;s consort in the myth &quot;Enki and Ninhursag&quot;, in which the eponymous goddess is treated as the same deity as Damgalnuna, Enki&#x27;s usual wife. However, Dina Katz points out that the goddesses were usually separate. In &quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot;, Enki instead refers to Ninmah as his sister.

===Attendants===

In the &quot;An = Anum&quot; god list, Dingirmah was assigned a &quot;sukkal&quot; (&quot;divine vizier&quot;) named Ekigara.

Her chief herald was the god Urumaš, and four additional deities who served as heralds were included in her entourage. Saparnuna was the herald of Kesh, Engal-DU.DU and Nimgir-Kurra were the heralds of the underworld, and Lugaligipirig was the herald of Adab. Six deities named Saĝšutašubšuba, KA.NI-šu-KID.DU.DU, Adgigi, Gudub, Ekurabsa, and Nin-Aruru (not to be confused with Aruru) were designated as her &quot;gud-balaĝ&quot; (&quot;bull lyres&quot;). Additionally, Šulpaedara, Šulpaeamaš, and Tuduga served as the &quot;standing gods&quot; of her E-maḫ temple in Adab.

Ninhursag in her mother/birth aspects was also likely affiliated with a group of seven minor goddesses known as the Šassūrātu, &quot;wombs&quot;, who were assistants of mother goddesses. These seven appear in &quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot; to assist in fashioning humankind from clay alongside their mistress, and are listed as Ninimma, Shuzianna, Ninmada, Ninšar, Ninmug, Mumudu, and Ninniginna.

===Syncretism===

Ninhursag was considered to be similar to the Elamite goddess Kiririsha, who was also regarded as the &quot;mother of the gods&quot;. Frédéric Grillot considered them to be equivalent to one another, but partially based his conclusion on an assumed parallel between the presumed union of Ninhursag and Enki with that of Kiririsha and Napirisha.

In Old Babylonian Mari the logographic writing dNIN.HUR.SAG.GA was used to represent the name of Shalash, the wife of Dagan.

In Hittite sources, the logographic writings DINGIR.MAH and dNIN.TU were used to render the name of the Hittite mother goddess Ḫannaḫanna.

In a bilingual Akkadian-Amorite lexical list from the Old Babylonian period which presumably originated in southern Mesopotamia, DIĜIR.MAḪ (Bēlet-ilī) was equated with an Amorite deity named ʔAṯeratum (&quot;a-še-ra-tum&quot;), but according to Andrew R. George and in this context the name designated Athirat, the goddess also known from Ugarit, rather than the Mesopotamian goddess Ašratum.

==Iconography==
Ninhursag was commonly depicted seated upon or near mountains, her hair sometimes in an omega shape and at times wearing a horned head-dress and tiered skirt. In a rectangular framed plaque from pre-Sargonic Girsu, the goddess seated upon &quot;scale like&quot; mountains is determined to be Ninhursag. Here she wears a crown that is more flat without horns, and has hair in an omega like shape. In another depiction, she is seated upon mountains and also has a mountain on her horned crown. Here she wears a tiered robe. She was identified as the female figure standing behind her son Ninurta on a fragment of the Stele of the Vultures.

Another symbol of hers was Deer, both male and female. Studies on a plaque from Mari have identified the stone as being a representation of her. The stone likely represents both a face and the naked female form. A notable feature of the plaque is the area below the &#x27;nose area&#x27; where ten stags stand eating plants on opposite sides of the face. There is another group of five animals under the nose, which are suspected to be birds. In a frieze recovered from the same Mari temple, two stags flank an Igmud-eagle, the symbol of her son Ninurta. There are a number of other images with this eagle as well (such as the vase in the gallery below), where deer, ibexes or gazelles are present to represent Ninhursag.

According to Johanna Stuckey, her symbol, resembling the Greek letter &quot;omega&quot; Ω, has been depicted in art from approximately 3000 BC, although more generally from the early second millennium BC. It appears on some boundary stones (kudurru) on the upper tier, indicating her importance. The omega symbol is associated with the Egyptian cow goddess Hathor, and may represent a stylized womb. Joan Goodnick Westenholz and Julia M. Asher-Greve argue that the symbol should be interpreted as a schematic representation of a woman&#x27;s hair rather than the shape of an uterus. They tentatively propose an identification with Nanaya rather than Ninhursag as well.

==Mythology==

===&quot;Enki and Ninhursag&quot;===

Two full copies of &quot;Enki and Ninhursag&quot; have been uncovered. One is from Nippur which contains the complete text (although some passages on the tablet are broken), and another from Ur, found in the house of a priest of Enki, where half of the text is missing. This second tablet contains fewer lines, and hence it is considered a truncated version. There exists also an excerpt, covering the incestuous couplings, which differs from the Nippur version&#x27;s events.

In &quot;Enki and Ninhursag&quot;, the goddess complains to Enki that the city of Dilmun is lacking in water. As a result, Enki makes the land rich, and Dilmun becomes a prosperous wetland. Afterwards, he and Ninhursag sleep together, resulting in a daughter, Ninsar (called &quot;Ninnisig&quot; in the ETCSL translation, &quot;Ninmu&quot; by Kramer). Ninsar matures quickly, and after Enki spots her walking along the bank, sleeps with her, resulting in a daughter, Ninkurra. Enki spots her and sleeps with her as well, resulting in Uttu. (In alternate versions the order is Ninkura, Ninima, then Uttu.) After Enki has intercourse with Uttu, Ninhursag removes the semen from her womb and plants it in the earth, causing eight plants to spring up. As a result of his actions, Ninhursag curses Enki by casting her &quot;life giving eye&quot; away from him. Enki then becomes gravely ill. A fox then makes an offer to Enlil that he will bring Ninhursag back to cure him; in exchange Enlil promises to erect two birch trees for the fox in his city, and to give the creature fame. The fox is able to retrieve Ninhursag, and she then cures Enki, giving birth to eight minor deities from his ailing body parts.

Comparisons between this myth and that of Genesis are common. As suggested by Samuel Kramer and W. F. Albright, Enki&#x27;s eating of the eight plants and the consequences following his actions can be compared to the consumption of the fruit of knowledge by Adam and Eve.

===&quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot;===

The text containing this myth has been recovered on tablets from varying locations. The primary two making up the translation are from the Old Babylonian period and were recovered from Nippur. A third tablet from this period was also found containing an extract of the middle of the myth as well. There was also a bilingual (Sumerian and Akkadian) version in the library of Assurbanipal, and one very fragmented tablet from the Middle Assyrian period that may contain the myth, but deviates from the bilingual version in the creation portion of the myth.

&quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot; as a narrative can be separated into two distinct parts, the first being the birth of mankind, and the second a competition between the two spouses. The first half of this text recounts Enki creating the first humans at the behest of Namma, referred to here as his mother. He receives help forming the body of men and women from Ninmah as well as her seven servants, the birth goddesses. Once man is finished the group has a banquet, where Enki and Ninmah drink beer and the other gods praise Enki&#x27;s greatness. In the second half, Ninmah creates seven humans with illnesses and disabilities, for whom Enki finds places in society. Enki then creates an individual so damaged that Ninmah cannot find a place for them, resulting in her losing the competition. She then complains that Enki has driven her away from her home. The ending of the text is not well understood (due to damage on the tablet), but is likely Enki consoling Ninmah and possibly finding a place for the human he made.

===&quot;Others&quot;===

Ninhursag appears in the text &quot;Creator of the Hoe&quot;, where she is referred to as &quot;the mother of the gods&quot;.

In the Anzû epic, Ninhursag under the name Bēlet-ilī or Mami speaks in support of Ninurta her son, and is given the epithet &quot;The Mistress of All Gods&quot;. In another myth involving her son, &quot;Ninurta&#x27;s Exploits&quot;, the titular god goes out to conquer the mountain land to the north of Babylonia, and piles the bodies of its stony kings into a great burial mound. He then dedicates this mountain to his mother, once Ninmah, now renamed Ninhursag after the mound.

Damkina is the mother of Marduk in Enūma Eliš.

==Worship==
Theories posit that, in earlier times, Ninhursag was the highest ranking female deity, but was later displaced from that status by Ninlil, before the Old Babylonian period where she was syncretized with other birthing goddesses.

As Ninhursaga, she had temples in Nippur (Ur III period), and Mari. In Adab, she was worshipped under her Diĝirmaḫ epithet. Under her Ninmah epithet, she had temples in Adab, Babylon, and Ĝirsu, known as &#x27;E-maḫ&#x27; or the &#x27;majestic house&#x27;.

A temple of hers from Ur&#x27;s Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)  was excavated by Sir Leonard Woolley during his series of excavations at various sites around the city, built presumably by a King A&#x27;annepada, as per the temple dedication: &quot;Aanepada King of Ur, son of Mesanepada King of Ur, has built this for his lady Ninkhursag.&quot; In Early Dynastic Lagash, a temple was dedicated to Ninhursag, then later to Ninmaḫ.

An inscribed door socket was found at an unexcavated mound on the Adaim river near where it meets the Tigris river, Khara&#x27;ib Ghdairife. It read &quot;Manistusu, king of Kis, builder of the temple of the goddess Ninhursaga in HA.A KI. Whoever removes this tablet, may Ninhursaga and Samas uproot his seed and destroy his progeny.&quot;

<doc id="77232" wikidata="Q822321" url="?curid=77232" title="Roc (mythology)">
<text>The roc is an enormous legendary bird of prey in the popular mythology of the Middle East.

The roc appears in Arab geographies and natural history, popularized in Arabian fairy tales and sailors&#x27; folklore. Ibn Battuta tells of a mountain hovering in the air over the China Seas, which was the roc. The story collection &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; includes tales &quot;Abd al-Rahman the Maghribi&#x27;s Story of the Rukh&quot; and &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot;, both of which include the roc.

==Etymology==
The English form &quot;roc&quot; originates via Antoine Galland&#x27;s French from Arabic &quot;ruḵḵ&quot; () and that from Persian &quot;ruḵ&quot; (). In both languages, Arabic and Persian, the word is written in the Arabic script as رخ. Common romanizations are &quot;ruḵḵ&quot; for the Arabic form and &quot;ruḵ&quot;, &quot;rokh&quot; or &quot;rukh&quot; for the Persian form.

==Eastern origins==
According to art historian Rudolf Wittkower, the idea of the roc had its origins in the story of the fight between the Indian solar bird Garuda and the chthonic serpent Nāga. The mytheme of Garuda carrying off an elephant that was battling a crocodile appears in two Sanskrit epics, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (I.1353) and the &quot;Ramayana&quot; (III.39).

The Ath Kadha Lihini (Warana) of Sri Lankan mythology, a large bird who hunted elephants and soared above casting a shadow as big as a cloud. Embekka Temple has wood carvings depicting how it might have looked.

== Western expansion ==
Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela reported a story reminiscent of the roc in which shipwrecked sailors escaped from a desert island by wrapping themselves in ox-hides and letting griffins carry them off as if they were cattle.

In the 13th century, Marco Polo (as quoted in Attenborough (1961: 32)) stated It was for all the world like an eagle, but one indeed of enormous size; so big in fact that its quills were twelve paces long and thick in proportion. And it is so strong that it will seize an elephant in its talons and carry him high into the air and drop him so that he is smashed to pieces; having so killed him, the bird swoops down on him and eats him at leisure.

Polo claimed that the roc flew to Mogadishu &quot;from the southern regions&quot;, and that the Great Khan sent messengers to the island who returned with a feather (likely a &quot;Raphia&quot; frond). He explicitly distinguishes the bird from a griffin.

In &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot; the roc appears on a tropical island during Sinbad&#x27;s second voyage. Because of Polo&#x27;s account, others identified the island as Madagascar, which became the location for stories about other giant birds. Doubtless, it was Polo&#x27;s description that inspired Antonio Pigafetta, one of Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s companions, who wrote or had ghost-written an embroidered account of the circumglobal voyage: in Pigafetta&#x27;s account the home grounds of the roc were the seas of China. Such descriptions captured the imaginations of later illustrators, such as Stradanus 1590 or Theodor de Bry in 1594 who showed an elephant being carried off in the roc&#x27;s talons, or showed the roc destroying entire ships in revenge for destruction of its giant egg, as recounted in the fifth voyage of Sinbad the Sailor. Ulisse Aldrovandi&#x27;s &quot;Ornithologia&quot; (1599) included a woodcut of a roc with a somewhat pig-like elephant in its talons, but in the rational world of the 17th century, the roc was regarded more critically. In the modern era, the roc, like many other mythological and folkloric creatures, has entered the bestiaries of some fantasy role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

==Rationalized accounts==
The scientific culture of the 19th century introduced some &quot;scientific&quot; rationalizations for the myth&#x27;s origins, by suggesting that the origin of the myth of the roc might lie in embellishments of the often-witnessed power of the eagle that could carry away a newborn lamb. In 1863, Bianconi suggested the roc was a raptor (Hawkins and Goodman, 2003: 1031). Recently a giant subfossil eagle, the Malagasy crowned eagle, identified from Madagascar was actually implicated as a top bird predator of the island, whose megafauna once included giant lemurs and pygmy hippopotamuses.
Another possible origin of the myth is accounts of eggs of another extinct Malagasy bird, the enormous &quot;Aepyornis&quot; elephant bird, hunted to extinction by the 16th century, that was three meters tall and flightless. There were reported elephant bird sightings at least in folklore memory as Étienne de Flacourt wrote in 1658. Its egg, live or subfossilised, was known as early as 1420, when sailors to the Cape of Good Hope found eggs of the roc, according to a caption in the 1456 Fra Mauro map of the world, which says that the roc &quot;carries away an elephant or any other great animal&quot;. Between 1830 and 1840 European travelers in Madagascar saw giant eggs and egg shells. English observers were more willing to believe their accounts because they knew of the moa in New Zealand. In 1851 the French Academy of Sciences received three eggs. They and later fossils seemingly confirmed to 19th-century Europeans that &quot;Aepyornis&quot; was the roc, but the real bird does not resemble an eagle as the roc is said to.
In addition to Polo&#x27;s account of the &quot;rukh&quot; in 1298, Chou Ch&#x27;ű-fei (周去非, Zhōu Qùfēi), in his 1178 book &quot;Lingwai Daida&quot;, told of a large island off Africa with birds large enough to use their quills as water reservoirs. Fronds of the raffia palm may have been brought to Kublai Khan under the guise of roc&#x27;s feathers.

==Religious tradition==
===Michael Drayton===
Through the 16th century the existence of the roc could be accepted by Europeans. In 1604, Michael Drayton envisaged the rocs being taken aboard the Ark:

&lt;poem&gt;All feathered things yet ever knowne to men,
From the huge Rucke, unto the little Wren;
From Forrest, Fields, from Rivers and from Pons,
All that have webs, or cloven-footed ones;
To the Grand Arke, together friendly came,
Whose severall species were too long to name.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Ethiopian===
The rukh is also identified in the Ethiopian holy book &quot;Kebra Negast&quot; as the agent responsible for delivering the blessed piece of wood to Solomon which enabled the great king to complete Solomon&#x27;s Temple. This piece of wood also is said to have transformed the Queen of Sheba&#x27;s foot from that of a goat to that of a human. The piece of wood that the rukh brought was therefore given an honored place in the Temple and decorated with silver rings. According to tradition, these silver rings were given to Judas Iscariot as payment for betraying Jesus; the piece of wood became Jesus&#x27;s cross.

<doc id="77233" wikidata="Q140406" url="?curid=77233" title="Zagreus">
<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Zagreus () was a god sometimes identified with an Orphic Dionysus, a son of Zeus and Persephone, who was dismembered by the Titans and reborn. In the earliest mention of Zagreus, he is paired with Gaia and called the &quot;highest&quot; god, though perhaps only in reference to the gods of the underworld. Aeschylus, however, links Zagreus with Hades, possibly as Hades&#x27; son, or as Hades himself. Noting &quot;Hades&#x27; identity as Zeus&#x27; &quot;katachthonios&quot; alter ego&quot;, Timothy Gantz postulated that Zagreus, originally the son of Hades and Persephone, later merged with the Orphic Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone.

== Etymology and origins ==
According to Martin Litchfield West, the &quot;most plausible etymology&quot; derives &quot;Zagreus&quot; from &quot;zagre&quot;, which is &quot;properly a pit for catching animals, but perhaps also one used for depositing animal remains or offerings to a chthonic deity&quot;, making Zagreus literally the &quot;god of pitfalls&quot;. Based on this etymology, Karl Kerényi concludes that &quot;zagreus&quot; was the Greek word for a &quot;hunter who catches living animals&quot;, and that &quot;an exact translation&quot; of &quot;Zagreus&quot; would be &quot;catcher of game&quot;.

As West notes, the word &quot;zagre&quot;, which only survives in Hesychius, has an Ionic ending. So if &quot;Zagreus&quot; does derive from &quot;zagre&quot;, then this would suggest an Ionian origin for Zagreus. But, according to Kerényi, Hesychius&#x27; definition of &quot;zagre&quot;, &quot;proves that the name contains the root &quot;zoë&quot; and &quot;zoön&quot;&quot;, the Greek words for &quot;life&quot; and &quot;Living thing&quot;, and according to West &quot;the vocalism, Zā- for Zō-, points to a Doric or North-west Greek home for the god&quot;. 

The tenth-century &quot;Etymologicum Gudianum&quot; interpreted the name as &quot;great hunter&quot;, deriving the word from &quot;za-&quot; (&quot;very&quot;) and &quot;agreuein&quot; (&quot;hunt&quot;), an etymology rejected by both West and Kerényi.
Others have suggested a relationship with the Zagros Mountains of western Iran. While Michael C. Astour suggests a derivation from the Ugaritic &quot;Sġr&quot; (pronounced &quot;ṣaġru&quot;?) meaning &quot;the Young One&quot;.

== Underworld ==
The early mentions of Zagreus, which occur only in fragments from lost works, connect Zagreus with the Greek underworld. The earliest is in a single quoted line from the (6th century BC?) epic &quot;Alcmeonis&quot;:

Perhaps here meaning the highest god of the underworld.

Evidently for Aeschylus, Zagreus was, in fact, an underworld god. In a fragment from one of Aeschylus&#x27; lost &quot;Sisyphus&quot; plays (c. 5th century BC), Zagreus seems to be the son of Hades, while in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Egyptians&quot; (&quot;Aigyptioi&quot;), Zagreus was apparently identified with Hades himself.

A fragment from Euripides&#x27; lost play &quot;Cretan Men&quot; (&quot;Kretes&quot;) has the chorus of Cretan men describe the &quot;pure life&quot; they have led since they became initiates (&quot;mystai&quot;) of Idaean Zeus and celebrants of:
and were consecrated and received the title of &quot;bacchus&quot;. This passage associates Zagreus with the cult of Zeus at Cretan Mount Ida, where the infant Zeus was guarded by the Cretan Curetes. According to West, Zagreus here is &quot;a god of nocturnal mystery-rites, associated with a sacramental feast of raw flesh (and thus with the dismemberment of an animal victim)&quot; and infers from this Euripidean passage that Zagreus &quot;played a part in mysteries which claimed a Cretan origin.&quot;

== Orphic Dionysus Zagreus ==
The Zagreus from the Euripides fragment is suggestive of Dionysus, the wine god son of Zeus and Semele, and in fact, although it seems not to occur anywhere in Orphic sources, the name “Zagreus” is elsewhere identified with an Orphic Dionysus, who had a very different tradition from the standard one. This Dionysus Zagreus was a son of Zeus and Persephone who was, as an infant, attacked and dismembered by the Titans, but later reborn as the son of Zeus and Semele. This dismemberment of Dionysus Zagreus (the &quot;sparagmos&quot;), taken together with an assumed Orphic , in which human beings arose from the ashes of the Titans (who had been struck by Zeus with his thunderbolt in punishment for the dismembering), is sometimes called the &quot;Zagreus myth&quot;. This story has often been considered the most important myth of Orphism, and has been described as &quot;one of the most enigmatic and intriguing of all Greek myths&quot;.

=== The &quot;sparagmos&quot; ===
As pieced together from various ancient sources, the reconstructed story of the &quot;sparagmos&quot;, that is the dismemberment of Dionysus Zagreus, usually given by modern scholars, goes as follows. Zeus had intercourse with Persephone in the form of a serpent, producing Dionysus. He is taken to Mount Ida where (like the infant Zeus) he is guarded by the dancing Curetes. Zeus intended Dionysus to be his successor as ruler of the cosmos, but a jealous Hera incited the Titans to kill the child. Distracting the infant Dionysus with various toys, including a mirror, the Titans seized Dionysus and tore (or cut) him to pieces. The pieces were then boiled, roasted and partially eaten, by the Titans. But Athena managed to save Dionysus&#x27; heart, by which Zeus was able to contrive his rebirth from Semele.

Although the extant Orphic sources do not mention the name &quot;Zagreus&quot; in connection with this dismembered Dionysus (or anywhere else), the (c. 3rd century BC) poet Callimachus perhaps did. We know that Callimachus, as well as his contemporary Euphorion, told the story of the dismembered child, and Byzantine sources quote Callimachus as referring to the birth of a &quot;Dionysos Zagreus&quot;, explaining that &quot;Zagreus&quot; was the poet&#x27;s name for a &quot;chthonic&quot; Dionysus, the son of Zeus by Persephone. The earliest certain identification of Zagreus with the dismembered Dionysus occurs in the writings of the late 1st century – early 2nd century AD biographer and essayist Plutarch, who mentions &quot;Zagreus&quot; as one of the names given to the figure by Delphic theologians. Later, in the 5th century AD, the Greek epic poet Nonnus, who tells the story of this Orphic Dionysus, calls him the &quot;older Dionysos ... illfated Zagreus&quot;, &quot;Zagreus the horned baby&quot;, &quot;Zagreus, the first Dionysos&quot;, &quot;Zagreus the ancient Dionysos&quot;, and &quot;Dionysos Zagreus&quot;, and the 6th-century AD Pseudo-Nonnus similarly refers to the dismembered Dionysus as &quot;Dionysus Zagreus&quot;.

The 1st century BC historian Diodorus Siculus says that according to &quot;some writers of myths&quot; there were two gods named Dionysus, an older one, who was the son of Zeus and Persephone, but that the &quot;younger one [born to Zeus and Semele] also inherited the deeds of the older, and so the men of later times, being unaware of the truth and being deceived because of the identity of their names thought there had been but one Dionysus.&quot;

According to Diodorus, this older Dionysus, was represented in painting and sculpture with horns, because he &quot;excelled in sagacity and was the first to attempt the yoking of oxen and by their aid to effect the sowing of the seed&quot;, and the younger was &quot;called Dimetor (Of Two Mothers) ... because the two Dionysoi were born of one father, but of two mothers&quot;. He also said that Dionysus &quot;was thought to have two forms ... the ancient one having a long beard, because all men in early times wore long beards, the younger one being youthful and effeminate and young.&quot;

====Cooking / eating====
Several accounts of the myth involved the Titans cooking and/or eating at least part of Dionysus. In the account attributed to Callimachus and Euphorion, the dismembered pieces of Dionysus were boiled in a cauldron, and Euphorion is quoted as saying that the pieces of Dionysus were placed over a fire. Diodorus also says that the pieces were &quot;boiled&quot;, and the late 2nd century Christian writer Clement of Alexandria says that the pieces were &quot;first boiled&quot; in a cauldron, then pierced with spits and roasted. Arnobius, an early 4th century Christian apologist, says that Dionysus&#x27; severed parts were &quot;thrown into pots that he might be cooked&quot;. None of these sources mention any actual eating, but other sources do. Plutarch says that the Titans &quot;tasted his blood&quot;, the 6th century AD Neoplatonist Olympiodorus says that they ate &quot;his flesh&quot;, and according to the 4th century euhemeristic account of the Latin astrologer and Christian apologist Firmicus Maternus, the Titans cooked the &quot;members in various ways and devoured them&quot; (&quot;membra consumunt&quot;), except for his heart.

====Resurrection / rebirth====
In the version of the story apparently told by Callimachus and Euphorion, the cauldron containing the boiled pieces of Dionysus, is given to Apollo for burial, who placed it beside his tripod at Delphi. And according to Philodemus, citing Euphorion, the pieces of Dionysus were &quot;reassembled by Rhea, and brought back to life&quot;, while according to Diodorus Siculus, the reassembly and resurrection of Dionysus was accomplished by Demeter. Later Orphic sources have Apollo receive Dionysus&#x27; remains from Zeus, rather than the Titans, and it was Apollo who reassembled Dionysus, rather than Rhea or Demeter.

In the accounts of Clement, and Firmicus Maternus cited above, as well as Proclus, and a scholium on Lycophron 355, Athena manages to save the heart of Dionysus, from which, according to Clement and the scholium, Athena received the name Pallas from the still beating (&quot;πάλλειν&quot;) heart. In Proclus&#x27; account Athena takes the heart to Zeus, and Dionysus is born again from Semele. According to the &quot;Fabulae&quot; of Hyginus, Jupiter (the Roman equivalent of Zeus) &quot;ground up his heart, put it in a potion, and gave it to Semele to drink&quot;, and she became pregnant with Dionysus.

====Osiris====
In the &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; Dionysus is often identified with the Egyptian god Osiris, and stories of the dismemberment and resurrection of Osiris parallel those of Dionysus Zagreus. According to Diodorus Siculus, Egyptian myths about Priapus said that the Titans conspired against Osiris, killed him, divided his body into equal parts, and &quot;slipped them secretly out of the house&quot;. All but Osiris&#x27; penis, which since none of them &quot;was willing to take it with him&quot;, they threw into the river. Isis, Osiris&#x27; wife, hunted down and killed the Titans, reassembled Osiris&#x27; body parts &quot;into the shape of a human figure&quot;, and gave them &quot;to the priests with orders that they pay Osiris the honours of a god&quot;. But since she was unable to recover the penis she ordered the priests &quot;to pay to it the honours of a god and to set it up in their temples in an erect position.&quot;

====Allegorical accounts====
Diodorus Siculus reports an allegorical interpretation of the myth of the dismemberment of Dionysus as representing the production of wine. Diodorus knew of a tradition whereby this Orphic Dionysus was the son of Zeus and Demeter, rather than Zeus and Persephone. This parentage was explained allegorically by identifying Dionysus with the grape vine, Demeter with the earth, and Zeus with the rain, saying that &quot;the vine gets its growth both from the earth and from rains and so bears as its fruit the wine which is pressed out from the clusters of grapes&quot;. According to Diodorus, Dionysus&#x27; dismemberment by the Titans represented the harvesting of the grapes, and the subsequent &quot;boiling&quot; of his dismembered parts &quot;has been worked into a myth by reason of the fact that most men boil the wine and then mix it, thereby improving its natural aroma and quality.&quot;

The Neronian-era Stoic Cornutus relates a similar allegorical interpretation, whereby the dismemberment represented the crushing of the grapes, and the rejoining of the dismembered pieces into a single body, represented the pouring of the juice into a single container.

====Rationalized accounts====
Diodorus also reports a rationalized account of the older Dionysus. In this account this Dionysus was a wise man, who was the inventor of the plough, as well as many other agricultural inventions. And according to Diodorus, these inventions, which greatly reduced manual labor, so pleased the people that they &quot;accorded to him honours and sacrifices like those offered to the gods, since all men were eager, because of the magnitude of his service to them, to accord to him immortality.&quot;

The Christian apologist Firmicus Maternus gives a rationalized euhemeristic account of the myth whereby Liber (Dionysus) was the bastard son of a Cretan king named Jupiter (Zeus). When Jupiter left his kingdom in the boy&#x27;s charge, the king&#x27;s jealous wife Juno (Hera), conspired with her servants, the Titans, to murder the bastard child. Beguiling him with toys, the Titans ambushed and killed the boy. To dispose of the evidence of their crime, the Titans chopped the body into pieces, cooked, and ate them. However the boy&#x27;s sister Minerva (Athena), who had been part of the murder plot, kept the heart. When her father the king returned, the sister turned informer and gave the boy&#x27;s heart to the king. In his fury, the king tortured and killed the Titans, and in his grief, he had a statue of the boy made, which contained the boy&#x27;s heart in its chest, and a temple erected in the boy&#x27;s honour. The Cretans, in order to pacify their furious savage and despotic king, established the anniversary of the boy&#x27;s death as a holy day. Sacred rites were held, in which the celebrants howling and feigning insanity tore to pieces a live bull with their teeth, and the basket in which boy&#x27;s heart had been saved, was paraded to the blaring of flutes and the crashing of cymbals, thereby turning a mere boy into a god.

=== The anthropogony ===

Most sources make no mention of what happened to the Titans after the murder of Dionysus. In the standard account of the Titans, given in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; (which does not mention Dionysus), after being overthrown by Zeus and the other Olympian gods, in the ten-year-long Titanomachy, the Titans are imprisoned in Tartarus. This might seem to preclude any subsequent story of the Titans killing Dionysus, and perhaps in an attempt to reconcile this standard account with the Dionysus Zagreus myth, according to Arnobius and Nonnus, the Titans end up imprisoned by Zeus in Tartarus, as punishment for their murder of Dionysus.

However, according to one source, from the fate of the Titans came a momentous event, the birth of humankind. Commonly presented as a part of the myth of the dismembered Dionysus Zagreus, is an Orphic anthropogony, that is, an Orphic account of the origin of human beings. According to this widely held view, as punishment for the crime of the &quot;sparagmos&quot;, Zeus struck the Titans with his thunderbolt, and from the remains of the destroyed Titans humankind was born, which resulted in a human inheritance of ancestral guilt, for this original sin of the Titans, and by some accounts &quot;formed the basis for an Orphic doctrine of the divinity of man.&quot; However, when and to what extent there existed any Orphic tradition which included these elements is the subject of open debate.

The only ancient source to explicitly connect the &quot;sparagmos&quot; and the anthropogony is the 6th century AD Neoplatonist Olympiodorus, who, as part of an argument against committing suicide, states that to take one&#x27;s life is &quot;forbidden&quot; because human bodies have a divine Dionysiac element within them. He explains that, in the Orphic tradition, after the Titans dismember and eat Dionysus, Zeus, out of anger, &quot;strikes them with his thunderbolts, and the soot of the vapors that rise from them becomes the matter from which men are created&quot;, meaning that, because the Titans ate the flesh of Dionysus, humans are a part of Dionysus, and so suicide is &quot;forbidden because our bodies belong to Dionysus&quot;.

The 2nd century AD biographer and essayist Plutarch, does make a connection between the &quot;sparagmos&quot; and a subsequent punishment of the Titans, but makes no mention of the anthropogony, or Orpheus, or Orphism. In his essay &quot;On the Eating of Flesh&quot;, Plutarch writes of &quot;stories told about the sufferings and dismemberment of Dionysus and the outrageous assaults of the Titans upon him, and their punishment and blasting by thunderbolt after they had tasted his blood&quot;.

Other sources have been taken as evidence for the anthropogony having been part of the story before Olympiodorus. The 5th-century AD Neoplatonist Proclus writes that, according to Orpheus, there were three races of humans, the last of which is the &quot;Titanic race&quot;, which &quot;Zeus formed [] from the limbs of the Titans&quot;. Proclus also refers to the &quot;mythical chastisement of the Titans and the generation of all mortal living beings out of them&quot; told by Orpheus, connecting the birth of mankind with the punishment of the Titans, though it is unclear whether this punishment comes after the dismemberment of Dionysus or the Hesiodic Titanomachy. Damascius, after mentioning the Titans&#x27; &quot;plot against Dionysus&quot;, recounts that &quot;lightning-bolts, shackles, [and] descents into various lower regions&quot; are the three punishments which it has been said the Titans suffered, and then states that humans are &quot;created from the fragments of the Titans&quot;, and &quot;their dead bodies&quot; have &quot;become men themselves&quot;. Passages from earlier sources have also been interpreted as referring to this idea: the 1st century AD writer Dio Chrysostom writes that humans are &quot;of the blood of the Titans&quot;, while the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot; call the Titans the &quot;ancestors of our fathers&quot;.

Earlier allusions to the myth possibly occur in the works of the poet Pindar, Plato, and Plato&#x27;s student Xenocrates. A fragment from a poem, presumed to be by Pindar, mentions Persephone accepting &quot;requital for ancient wrong&quot;, from the dead, which might be a reference to humans&#x27; inherited responsibility for the Titans&#x27; killing of Dionysus. Plato, in presenting a succession of stages whereby, because of excessive liberty, men degenerate from reverence for the law, to lawlessness, describes the last stage where &quot;men display and reproduce the character of the Titans of story&quot;. This Platonic passage is often taken as referring to the anthropogony, however, whether men are supposed by Plato to &quot;display and reproduce&quot; this lawless character because of their Titanic heritage, or by simple imitation, is unclear. Xenocrates&#x27; reference to the Titans (and perhaps Dionysus) to explain Plato&#x27;s use of the word &quot;custody&quot; (&quot;φρούρα&quot;), has also been seen as possible evidence of a pre-Hellenistic date for the myth.

== In popular culture ==
Zagreus is the protagonist of the 2020 video game &quot;Hades&quot;. In the game, Zagreus is the son of Hades and is attempting to escape the underworld to find his mother Persephone, who disappeared before his time, and learn why she left.

<text>Acoetes (, via ) was the name of four men in Greek and Roman mythology.
* Acoetes, a fisherman who helped the god Bacchus.
* Acoetes, father to the Trojan priest Laocoön, who warned about the Trojan Horse. As the brother of Anchises, he was therefore the son of King Capys of Dardania and Themiste, daughter of King Ilus of Troad.
* Acoetes, an aged man who was the former squire Evander in Arcadia, before the latter emigrated to Italy.
* Acoetes, a soldier in the army of the Seven against Thebes. When this army fought the Thebes for the first time on the plain, a fierce battle took place at the gates of the city. During these fights Agreus, from Calydon, cut off the arm of the Theban Phegeus. The severed limb fell to the ground while the hand still held the sword. Acoetes, who came forward, was so terrified of that arm that he hit it with his own sword.

<text>In Greek mythology, maenads (; ) were the female followers of Dionysus and the most significant members of his retinue, the &quot;thiasus&quot;.
Their name, which comes from μαίνομαι (&quot;maínomai&quot;, “to rave, to be mad; to rage, to be angry”), literally translates as &#x27;raving ones&#x27;. Maenads were known as Bassarids, Bacchae , or Bacchantes in Roman mythology after the penchant of the equivalent Roman god, Bacchus, to wear a bassaris or fox skin.

Often the maenads were portrayed as inspired by Dionysus into a state of ecstatic frenzy through a combination of dancing and intoxication. During these rites, the maenads would dress in fawn skins and carry a thyrsus, a long stick wrapped in ivy or vine leaves and tipped with a pine cone. They would weave ivy-wreaths around their heads or wear a bull helmet in honor of their god, and often handle or wear snakes.

These women were mythologized as the &quot;mad women&quot; who were nurses of Dionysus in Nysa. Lycurgus &quot;chased the Nurses of the frenzied Dionysus through the holy hills of Nysa, and the sacred implements dropped to the ground from the hands of one and all, as the murderous Lycurgus struck them down with his ox-goad&quot;. They went into the mountains at night and practised strange rites.

According to Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Alexander&quot;, maenads were called &quot;Mimallones&quot; and &quot;Klodones&quot; in Macedon, epithets derived from the feminine art of spinning wool. Nevertheless, these warlike &quot;parthenoi&quot; (&quot;virgins&quot;) from the hills, associated with a &quot;Dionysios pseudanor&quot; (&quot;fake male Dionysus&quot;), routed an invading enemy. In southern Greece they were described as &quot;Bacchae&quot;, &quot;Bassarides&quot;, &quot;Thyiades&quot;, &quot;Potniades&quot;, and other epithets.

The term maenad has come to be associated with a wide variety of women, supernatural, mythological, and historical, associated with the god Dionysus and his worship.
In Euripides&#x27; play &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, maenads of Thebes murder King Pentheus after he bans the worship of Dionysus. Dionysus, Pentheus&#x27; cousin, himself lures Pentheus to the woods, where the maenads tear him apart. His corpse is mutilated by his own mother, Agave, who tears off his head, believing it to be that of a lion. A group of maenads also kill Orpheus, when he refuses to entertain them while mourning his dead wife.

In ceramic art, the frolicking of Maenads and Dionysus is often a theme depicted on kraters, used to mix water and wine. These scenes show the maenads in their frenzy running in the forests, often tearing to pieces any animal they happen to come across.

German philologist Walter Friedrich Otto writes:
==Cult worship==
===Bacchanalia===
Cultist rites associated with the worship of the Greek god of wine, Dionysus (or Bacchus in Roman mythology), were characterized by maniacal dancing to the sound of loud music and crashing cymbals, in which the revelers, called Bacchantes, whirled, screamed, became drunk and incited one another to greater and greater ecstasy. The goal was to achieve a state of enthusiasm in which the celebrants&#x27; souls were temporarily freed from their earthly bodies and were able to commune with Bacchus/Dionysus and gain a glimpse of and a preparation for what they would someday experience in eternity. The rite climaxed in a performance of frenzied feats of strength and madness, such as uprooting trees, tearing a bull (the symbol of Dionysus) apart with their bare hands, an act called &quot;sparagmos&quot;, and eating its flesh raw, an act called &quot;omophagia&quot;. This latter rite was a sacrament akin to communion in which the participants assumed the strength and character of the god by symbolically eating the raw flesh and drinking the blood of his symbolic incarnation. Having symbolically eaten his body and drunk his blood, the celebrants became possessed by Dionysus.

===Priestesses of Dionysus===
Maenads are found in later references as priestesses of the Dionysian cult. In the third century BC, when the city of Magnesia wanted to establish a maenadic cult in honour of Dionysus, the Delphic Oracle bade them, &quot;Go to the holy plain of Thebes to fetch maenads from the race of Cadmean Ino. They will bring you maenadic rites and noble customs and will establish troops of Bacchus in your city.&quot;

==Myths==
Dionysus came to his birthplace, Thebes, where neither Pentheus, his cousin who was now king, nor Pentheus&#x27; mother Agave, Dionysus&#x27; aunt (Semele&#x27;s sister) acknowledged his divinity. Dionysus punished Agave by driving her insane, and in that condition, she killed her son and tore him to pieces. From Thebes, Dionysus went to Argos where all the women except the daughters of King Proetus joined in his worship. Dionysus punished them by driving them mad, and they killed the infants who were nursing at their breasts. He did the same to the daughters of Minyas, King of Orchomenos in Boetia, and then turned them into bats.

According to Oppian, Dionysus delighted, as a child, in tearing kids into pieces and bringing them back to life again. He is characterized as &quot;the raging one&quot; and &quot;the mad one&quot; and the nature of the maenads, from which they get their name, is, therefore, his nature.

Once during a war in the middle of the third century BC, the entranced Thyiades (maenads) lost their way and arrived in Amphissa, a city near Delphi. There they sank down exhausted in the market place and were overpowered by a deep sleep. The women of Amphissa formed a protective ring around them and when they awoke arranged for them to return home unmolested.
On another occasion, the Thyiades were snowed in on Parnassos and it was necessary to send a rescue party. The clothing of the men who took part in the rescue froze solid. It is unlikely that the Thyiades, even if they wore deerskins over their shoulders, were ever dressed more warmly than the men.

===Nurses and nymphs===

In the realm of the supernatural is the category of nymphs who nurse and care for the young Dionysus, and continue in his worship as he comes of age. The god Hermes is said to have carried the young Dionysus to the nymphs of Nysa.

In another myth, when his mother, Semele, is killed, the care of young Dionysus falls into the hands of his sisters, Ino, Agave, and Autonoe, who later are depicted as participating in the rites and taking a leadership role among the other maenads.

===Resisters to the new religion===

The term &quot;maenads&quot; also refers to women in mythology who resisted the worship of Dionysus and were driven mad by him, forced against their will to participate in often horrific rites. The doubting women of Thebes, the prototypical maenads or &quot;mad women&quot;, left their homes to live in the wilds of the nearby mountain Cithaeron. When they discovered Pentheus spying on them, dressed as a maenad, they tore him limb from limb.

This also occurs with the three daughters of Minyas, who reject Dionysus and remain true to their household duties, becoming startled by invisible drums, flutes, cymbals, and seeing ivy hanging down from their looms. As punishment for their resistance, they become madwomen, choosing the child of one of their number by lot and tearing it to pieces, as the women on the mountain did to young animals. A similar story with a tragic end is told of the daughters of Proetus.

===Voluntary revelers===

Not all women were inclined to resist the call of Dionysus, however. Maenads, possessed by the spirit of Dionysus, traveled with him from Thrace to mainland Greece in his quest for the recognition of his divinity. Dionysus was said to have danced down from Parnassos accompanied by Delphic virgins, and it is known that even as young girls the women in Boeotia practiced not only the closed rites but also the bearing of the thyrsus and the dances.

A possible foundation myth is the ancient festival called Agrionia. According to Greek authors like Plutarch, female followers of Dionysios went in search of him and when they could not find him prepared a feast. As Plutarch records this festival, a priest would chase a group of virgins down with a sword. These women were supposed to be descendants of the women who sacrificed their son in the name of Dionysios. The priest would catch one of the women and execute her. This human sacrifice was later omitted from the festival. Eventually the women would be freed from the intense ecstatic experience of the festival and return to their usual lives. The Agrionia was celebrated in several Greek cities, but especially in Boeotia. Each Boeotian city had its own distinct foundation myth for it, but the pattern was much the same: the arrival of Dionysus, resistance to him, flight of the women to a mountain, the killing of Dionysus&#x27; persecutor, and eventual reconciliation with the god.

== List of maenads ==
* Alcimacheia – daughter of Harpalion and a maenad from Lemnos who followed Dionysus in his Indian campaign. She was killed during the Indian war by Morrheus, an Indian general son of Didnasos.
* Bromie – one of the maenads who tried to kill Lycurgus.
* Calybe – another follower of Dionysus in the Indian War.
* Chalcomede – when she followed Dionysus in his Indian campaign, the Indian general Morrheus, hit by one of Eros&#x27; arrows, fell in love with her, and when he was about to seize her a serpent darted out of her bosom to protect her.
* Charopeia – leader of the Bacchic dance. She followed Dionysus in his Indian campaign.
* Chorea – followed Dionysus in his expedition against Argos. Perseus is said to have put all the women to the sword, including Chorea, but since she had a higher rank she was not buried in a common grave, but had a tomb apart, which some consider a great honor, although nothing tangible or of any benefit for the dead man or woman appears to come from it. And the memory is kept of many who do not have a tomb.
* Cisseis – one of the maenads who tried to kill Lycurgus.
* Clite – one of the maenads who tried to kill Lycurgus.
* Codone – a follower of Dionysus in the Indian war. She was killed by Morrheus.
* Coronis – a Thessalian who was raped by Butes, a Thracian. The latter had plotted against his brother, Lycurgus, and had to go in exile. Having traveled through the Cyclades, he and his companions came to Thessaly. There they met the maenads who fled in fright as the men rushed upon them. However Butes seized Coronis and raped her, and she, angry at the seizure and the treatment she received, called upon Dionysus, who, hearing her prayer, drove him mad. Butes then threw himself into a well and died.
* Eriphe – one of the maenads who tried to kill Lycurgus.
* Eurypyle – a follower of Dionysus in the Indian war. She was killed by Morrheus.
* Gigarto – one of the maenads who tried to kill Lycurgus. She was killed by Morrheus.
* Gorge – one of the followers of Dionysus in the Indian War.
* Melictaina – one of the followers of Dionysus in the Indian War.
* Myrto – one of the followers of Dionysus in the Indian War.
* Nyse – one of the followers of Dionysus in the Indian War.
* Oenone – one of the followers of Dionysus in the Indian War.
* Phasyleia – a maid in the train of Methe. She was the leader of the Bacchanal dance. After Methe the surfeit of wine (drunkenness) was called. Methe was married to King Staphylus of Assyria, who entertained Dionysus in his palace; after him the carryberry bunch of grapes was called.
* Phlio – one of the maenads who tried to kill Lycurgus.
* Polyxo – one of the maenads who tried to kill Lycurgus.
* Soe – one of the maenads who joined Dionysus in his Indian campaign. She was killed by the Indian general Morrheus.

* Terpsichore – a dancing maenad who followed Dionysus in the Indian War and drove away the Indian army with her dance.
* Theope – one of the maenads who tried to kill Lycurgus.

== List of maenads in Dionysiaca ==
Eighteen maenads are named in Dionysiaca of Nonnus of Panopolis:

==In art==
Maenads have been depicted in art as erratic and frenzied women enveloped in a drunken rapture, as in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;The Bacchae&quot;. In Euripides&#x27; play and other art forms and works, the frenzied dances of the god are direct manifestations of euphoric possession, and these worshippers, sometimes by eating the flesh of a man or animal who has temporarily incarnated the god, come to partake of his divinity.

Depictions of maenads are often found on both red and black-figure Greek pottery, statues, and jewelry. Also, fragments of reliefs of female worshipers of Dionysus have been discovered at Corinth. Mark W. Edwards in his paper &quot;Representation of Maenads on Archaic Red-Figure Vases&quot; traces the evolution of maenad depictions on red figure vases. Edwards distinguishes between &quot;nymphs,&quot; which appear earlier on Greek pottery, and &quot;maenads,&quot; which are identified by their characteristic fawnskin or &quot;nebris&quot; and often carry snakes in their hands. However, Edwards does not consider the actions of the figures on the pottery to be a distinguishing characteristic for differentiation between maenads and nymphs. Rather, the differences or similarities in their actions are more striking when comparing black figure and red figure pottery, as opposed to maenads and nymphs.

==References in modern culture==
A maenad appears in Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;Ode to the West Wind&quot;.

Maenads, along with Bacchus and Silenus, appear in C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;. They are portrayed as wild, fierce girls who dance and perform somersaults.

&quot;The Bassarids&quot; (composed 1964–65, premiered 1966), to a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is the most famous opera composed by Hans Werner Henze.

Maenads are the adopted symbol of Tetovo in North Macedonia, depicted prominently of the city&#x27;s coat of arms. The inclusion of maenad imagery dates to 1932 when a small statuette of a maenad, dating to the 6th century BC, was found in the city. The &quot;Tetovo Maenad&quot; was featured on the reverse of a Macedonian 5000 denar banknote issued in 1996.

<text>The Bacchae (; , &quot;Bakkhai&quot;; also known as The Bacchantes ) is an ancient Greek tragedy, written by the Athenian playwright Euripides during his final years in Macedonia, at the court of Archelaus I of Macedon. It premiered posthumously at the Theatre of Dionysus in 405 BC as part of a tetralogy that also included &quot;Iphigeneia at Aulis&quot; and &quot;Alcmaeon in Corinth&quot;, and which Euripides&#x27; son or nephew is assumed to have directed. It won first prize in the City Dionysia festival competition.

The tragedy recounts the Greek myth of King Pentheus of Thebes and his mother Agave, who were punished by the god Dionysus (who is Pentheus&#x27;s cousin) for rejecting his cult. The play opens with Dionysus proclaiming that he has arrived in Thebes with his votaries to avenge the slander, repeated by his aunts, that he is not the son of Zeus. Disguised as a foreign holy man, the god intends to introduce Dionysian rites into the city, but the Thebans reject his divinity and king Pentheus orders his arrest. Eventually, Dionysus drives Pentheus insane luring him to the mountains. The play ends with the women of Thebes, driven by Dionysus&#x27;s orgiastic frenzy, tearing Pentheus apart, while his mother Agave bears his head on a thyrsus to her father Cadmus.

Regarded as Euripides&#x27; masterpiece, &quot;The Bacchae&quot; is classified among the greatest ancient tragedies. &quot;The Bacchae&quot; is distinctive in that the chorus is integrated into the plot and the god is not a distant presence, but a character in the play, indeed, the protagonist.

==Background==

The Dionysus in Euripides&#x27; tale is a young god, angry that his mortal family, the royal house of Cadmus, has denied him a place of honor as a deity. His mortal mother, Semele, was a mistress of Zeus; and while pregnant, was tricked by a jealous Hera to request Zeus to come to her in his true form. Being only a mortal, she was struck down by Zeus&#x27; thunderbolts while in his presence and was killed. Zeus then saved Dionysus, who was in Semele&#x27;s womb, by sewing him into a cavity in his thigh. When Semele died, her sisters said it was Zeus&#x27; will and accused her of lying; they also accused their father, Cadmus, of claiming Semele was pregnant by Zeus to cover up an affair with a mortal man. Most of Semele&#x27;s family refused to believe Dionysus was the son of Zeus, and the young god was spurned by his household. He traveled throughout Asia and other foreign lands, gathering a cult of female worshipers, the Maenads. At the start of the play, Dionysus returns to Thebes, disguised as a stranger, to take revenge on the house of Cadmus. He has also driven the women of Thebes, including his aunts, into an ecstatic frenzy, sending them dancing and hunting on Mount Cithaeron, much to the horror of the young Pentheus, king of Thebes who also is Dionysus&#x27; cousin. Complicating matters, Pentheus has declared a ban on the worship of Dionysus throughout Thebes.

==Plot==
The play begins before the palace at Thebes, with Dionysus telling the story of his birth and his reasons for visiting the city. Dionysus explains he is the son of a mortal woman, Semele, and a god, Zeus. Some in Thebes, he notes, do not believe this story. In fact, Semele&#x27;s sisters—Autonoe, Agave, and Ino—claim it is a lie intended to cover up the fact that Semele became pregnant by some mortal. Dionysus reveals that he has driven the women of the city mad, including his three aunts, and has led them into the mountains to observe his ritual festivities. He has disguised himself as a mortal for the time being, but he plans to vindicate his mother by appearing before all of Thebes as a god, the son of Zeus, and establishing his permanent cult of followers.

Dionysus exits to the mountains, and the chorus (composed of the titular Bacchae) enters. They perform a choral ode in praise of Dionysus. Then Tiresias, the blind and elderly seer, appears. He calls for Cadmus, the founder and former king of Thebes. The two old men start out to join the revelry in the mountains when Cadmus’ petulant young grandson Pentheus, the current king, enters. Disgusted to find the two old men in festival dress, he scolds them and orders his soldiers to arrest anyone engaging in Dionysian worship, including the mysterious &quot;foreigner&quot; who has introduced this worship. Pentheus intends to have him stoned to death.

The guards soon return with Dionysus himself in tow. Pentheus questions him, both skeptical of and fascinated by the Dionysian rites. Dionysus&#x27;s answers are cryptic. Infuriated, Pentheus has Dionysus taken away and chained to an angry bull in the palace stable, but the god shows his power. He breaks free and razes the palace with an earthquake and fire. Dionysus and Pentheus are once again at odds when a herdsman arrives from the top of Mount Cithaeron, where he had been herding his grazing cattle. He reports that he found women on the mountain behaving strangely: wandering the forest, suckling animals, twining snakes in their hair, and performing miraculous feats. The herdsmen and the shepherds made a plan to capture one particular celebrant, Pentheus&#x27; mother. But when they jumped out of hiding to grab her, the Bacchae became frenzied and pursued the men. The men escaped, but their cattle were not so fortunate, as the women fell upon the animals, ripping them to shreds with their bare hands. The women carried on, plundering two villages that were further down the mountain, stealing bronze, iron and even babies. When villagers attempted to fight back, the women drove them off using only their ceremonial staffs of fennel. They then returned to the mountain top and washed up, as snakes licked them clean.

Dionysus, still in disguise, persuades Pentheus to forgo his plan to defeat and massacre the women with an armed force. He says it would be better first to spy on them, while disguised as a female Maenad to avoid detection. Dressing Pentheus in this fashion, giving him a thyrsus and fawn skins, Dionysus leads him out of the house. At this point, Pentheus seems already crazed by the god&#x27;s power, as he thinks he sees two suns in the sky, and believes he now has the strength to rip up mountains with his bare hands. He has also begun to see through Dionysus&#x27; mortal disguise, perceiving horns coming out of the god&#x27;s head. They exit to Cithaeron.

A messenger arrives to report that once the party reached Mount Cithaeron, Pentheus wanted to climb an evergreen tree to get a better view and the stranger used divine power to bend down the tall tree and place the king in its highest branches. Then Dionysus, revealing himself, called out to his followers and pointed out the man in the tree. This drove the Maenads wild. Led by Agave, his mother, they forced the trapped Pentheus down from the tree top, ripped off his limbs and his head, and tore his body into pieces.

After the messenger has relayed this news, Agave arrives, carrying her son&#x27;s bloodied head. In her god-maddened state, she believes it is the head of a mountain lion. She proudly displays it to her father, Cadmus, and is confused when he does not delight in her trophy, but is horrified by it. Agave then calls out for Pentheus to come marvel at her feat, and nail the head above her door so she can show it to all of Thebes. But now the madness begins to wane, and Cadmus forces her to recognize that she has destroyed her own son. As the play ends, the corpse of Pentheus is reassembled as well as is possible, and the royal family is devastated and destroyed. Agave and her sisters are sent into exile, and Dionysus decrees that Cadmus and his wife Harmonia will be turned into snakes and lead a barbarian horde to plunder the cities of Hellas.

==In classical history==
In his biography of the Roman statesman and general Marcus Licinius Crassus, the ancient historian Plutarch claims that after his defeat and death at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC, Crassus&#x27; head was sent to the king of Parthia, Orodes II, where it was used &quot;as a prop, standing in for the head of the tragic Pentheus&quot; in a production of &quot;The Bacchae&quot;.

==Modern productions==

===Dramatic versions===

* Joe Orton&#x27;s play The Erpingham Camp (television broadcast 27 June 1966; opened at the Royal Court Theatre on 6 June 1967) relocates &quot;The Bacchae&quot; to a British holiday camp. An author&#x27;s note states: &quot;No attempt must be made to reproduce the various locales in a naturalistic manner. A small, permanent set of Erpingham&#x27;s office is set on a high level. The rest of the stage is an unlocalised area. Changes of scene are suggested by lighting and banners after the manner of the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s productions of Shakespeare&#x27;s histories.&quot;
* In 1970, Brian De Palma filmed Richard Schechner&#x27;s dramatic re-envisioning of the work, &quot;Dionysus in 69&quot;, in a converted garage.
* Wole Soyinka adapted the play as &quot;The Bacchae of Euripides: A Communion Rite&quot; with the British Royal National Theatre in London in 1973, incorporating a second chorus of slaves to mirror the civil unrest in his native Nigeria.
* Caryl Churchill and David Lan used the play as the basis of their 1986 dance-theatre hybrid &quot;A Mouthful of Birds&quot;.
* In 1989 Costas Ferris adapted &quot;The Bacchae&quot; for his film &quot;Oh Babylon&quot; and retells it in a more modern guise.
* Andre Gregory related in &quot;My Dinner With Andre&quot; that he put on a production at Yale University and campaigned to have a real cadaver&#x27;s head used for Pentheus&#x27;, but the actress playing Agave refused.
* &quot;The Bacchae 2.1&quot;, a theatrical adaptation set in modern times, was written by Charles Mee and first performed in 1993.
* Swedish director Ingmar Bergman directed &quot;The Bacchae&quot; three times: as an opera (1991) for the Royal Swedish Opera, as a film (1993) for Sveriges Television, and on stage (1996) for the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. These three versions received great acclaim amidst some mixed reviews.
* In 1997, Brad Mays directed his own adaptation of the play at The Complex in Los Angeles, where it broke all box office records and was nominated for three LA Weekly Theater Awards: for Best Direction, Best Musical Score and Best Production Design. Because it featured levels of violence and nudity rare for even experimental theater, it was widely discussed in print, and even videotaped for the Lincoln Center&#x27;s Billy Rose Theatre Collection in New York. The production was eventually made into an independent feature film which featured Will Shepherd – the Pentheus of Richard Schechner&#x27;s &quot;Dionysus in &#x27;69&quot; – as Cadmus. Both the stage and film versions were produced by Mays&#x27; wife, Lorenda Starfelt.
* On 20 April 2003 BBC Radio 3 premiered the radio play &quot;Dionysos&quot; – a ninety-minute drama based on &quot;The Bacchae&quot; – written by Andrew Rissik and starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, with Paul Scofield as Cadmus and Diana Rigg as Agave. It was repeated on BBC Radio 7 in May 2008.
* In 2004, KneeHigh Theatre company toured a reinvented version of The Bacchae as &quot;A contemporary postmodern folk tale&quot;, directed by Emma Rice.
* In 2007, David Greig wrote an adaptation of &quot;The Bacchae&quot; for the National Theatre of Scotland starring Alan Cumming as Dionysus, with ten soul-singing followers in place of the traditional Greek chorus.

==Religious significance==
Greek theater was a form of religious expression and worship. &quot;The Bacchae&quot; re-enacts how Dionysus had come to be a god. In ancient Greek theatre, &quot;role-playing is a well-known feature of ritual liminality.&quot;

To an actor, religious worship is a direct experience. The actor would have experienced a &quot;stepping out&quot; of himself to become a representation of Dionysus. As a spectator, the experience comes from what is acted onstage, arousing emotions that sympathize with Dionysus. Collectively, through Dionysiac acting, there is a reintegration of the &quot;other&quot; into the &quot;self&quot;, that is to say that Dionysus has been accepted and will be worshipped by the Greek people.

===Comparative analysis===
Jesus&#x27;s interrogation by Pontius Pilate from The Bible has been compared to Dionysus&#x27; interrogation by King Pentheus regarding his claim to divinity.

==Dramatic structure==

In the play&#x27;s climactic plot construction, Dionysus the protagonist instigates the unfolding action by simultaneously emulating the play&#x27;s author, costume designer, choreographer and artistic director. Helene P. Foley, writing of the importance of Dionysus as the central character and his effect on the play&#x27;s structure, observes: &quot;The poet uses the ritual crisis to explore simultaneously god, man, society, and his own tragic art. In this protodrama Dionysus, the god of the theatre, stage-directs the play.&quot;

At the play&#x27;s start, Dionysus&#x27; exposition highlights the play&#x27;s central conflict: the invasion of Greece by an Asian religion. 
==Reception==
&quot;The Bacchae&quot; has been the subject of widely varying interpretations regarding what the play as a whole means, or even indeed whether there is a “moral” to the story. Hans Oranje calls such questions the riddle of the Bacchae, and says that the play concerns itself with “wisdom, cleverness, and soundness of mind.” The extraordinary beauty and passion of the poetic choral descriptions indicate that the author certainly knew what attracted those who followed Dionysus. The vivid gruesomeness of the punishment of Pentheus suggests that he could also understand those who were troubled by religion.

At one time the interpretation that prevailed was that the play was an expression of Euripides’ religious devotion, as though after a life of being critical of the Greek gods and their followers, the author finally repented of his cynicism, and wrote a play that honors Dionysus and that carries a dire warning to nonbelievers. Then, at the end of the 19th century the opposite idea began to take hold: it was thought that Euripides was doing with &quot;The Bacchae&quot; what he had always done, pointing out the inadequacy of the Greek gods and religions.

Until the late 19th century, the play&#x27;s themes were considered too gruesome to be studied and appreciated. It was Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Birth of Tragedy&quot; in 1872 that re-posed the question of Dionysus&#x27;s relation with the theatre and awakened interest in &quot;The Bacchae&quot;. In the 20th century, performances became quite fashionable—particularly in opera, due in part to the dramatic choruses found throughout the story. In 1948, R.P. Winnington-Ingram said of Euripides&#x27; handling of the play: &quot;On its poetical and dramatic beauties, he writes with charm and insight; on more complex themes, he shows equal mastery.&quot; Recent criticism has been provided by P.E. Easterling, &quot;et al.&quot; in &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Greek Tragedy.&quot;

==Influences==
&quot;The Bacchae&quot; had an enormous impact on ancient literature, and its influence can be seen in numerous Greek and Roman authors. It seems to have been one of Horace&#x27;s favorite tragedies. Beyond antiquity, dramatists and filmmakers of all ages have been greatly impacted by it. The tragedy&#x27;s influence can be seen in the writings of Henrik Ibsen, as well as Thomas Mann&#x27;s 1912 novella &quot;Death in Venice&quot; and Oliver Stone&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;Alexander&quot;. The Renaissance Venetian painter Titian may have illustrated the arrest of Bacchus in his painting &quot;Il Bravo&quot; in Vienna&#x27;s Kunsthistorisches Museum.

===In popular culture===
* Donna Tartt&#x27;s 1992 novel &quot;The Secret History&quot; is about six students of classical languages who go in search of the rapture described by Euripides in &quot;The Bacchae&quot;.
* J. M. Tolcher&#x27;s 2023 autobiography, &quot;Poof&quot;, makes direct reference to &quot;The Bacchae&quot;: Dionysus and Pentheus return as characters, and the book addresses many of the same themes such as femininity, intoxication, and liberation from oppression in a contemporary Australian setting.

<doc id="77239" wikidata="Q391091" url="?curid=77239" title="Pentheus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Pentheus (; ) was a king of Thebes. His father was Echion, the wisest of the Spartoi. His mother was Agave, the daughter of Cadmus, the founder of Thebes, and grandson of the goddess Harmonia. His sister was Epeiros and his son was Menoeceus.

Much of what is known about the character comes from the interpretation of the myth in Euripides&#x27; tragic play, &quot;The Bacchae&quot;.

==Mythological biography==
The story of Pentheus&#x27; resistance to Dionysus and his subsequent punishment is presented by Euripides as follows. 
Cadmus, the king of Thebes, abdicated due to his old age in favour of his grandson Pentheus. Pentheus soon banned the worship of the god Dionysus, who was the son of his aunt Semele, and forbade the women of Cadmeia to partake in his rites. 
An angered Dionysus caused Pentheus&#x27; mother Agave and his aunts Ino and Autonoë, along with all the other women of Thebes, to rush to Mount Cithaeron in a Bacchic frenzy. Accordingly, Pentheus imprisoned Dionysus, thinking the man simply a follower, but his chains fell off and the jail doors opened for him.
Dionysus lured Pentheus, disguised as a woman, out to spy on the Bacchic rites, where Pentheus expected to see sexual activities. The daughters of Cadmus saw him in a tree and thought him to be a wild animal. They pulled Pentheus down and tore him limb from limb (as part of a ritual known as the sparagmos). When his true identity was later discovered, officials exiled the women from Thebes. Some say that his own mother was the first to attack him, tearing his arm off and then tearing off his head. She placed the head on a stick and took it back to Thebes, but only realized whose head it was after meeting her father Cadmus.

The name &quot;Pentheus&quot;, as Dionysus and Tiresias both point out, means &quot;Man of Sorrows&quot; and derives from πένθος, &quot;pénthos&quot;, sorrow or grief, especially the grief caused by the death of a loved one. His name appeared to mark him for tragedy. Pentheus was succeeded by his uncle Polydorus.

Before or possibly after Pentheus was killed, his wife gave birth to a son named Menoeceus, who became the father of Creon and Jocasta. He became the grandfather of Oedipus.

The story of Pentheus is also discussed by Ovid in Book III of his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Ovid&#x27;s version diverges from Euripides&#x27; work in several areas. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, King Pentheus is warned by the blind seer Tiresias to welcome Bacchus or else &quot;Your blood [shall be] poured out and defile the woods and your mother and her sisters...&quot; Pentheus dismisses Tiresias and ignores his warnings. As Thebes succumbs to the &quot;dementia and the delirium of the new god&quot;, Pentheus laments the fall of his kingdom and demands the arrest of Bacchus. His guards instead arrest Acoetes of Maeonia, a sailor who confirms the divinity of Bacchus and tells how the crew of his ship ended up being turned into dolphins after trying to kidnap the young god.

Pentheus, convinced that Acoetes is lying, tries to throw him in jail, but when the guards try to shackle Acoetes, the chains fall off. In a rage, Pentheus ran to deal with Bacchus himself. He charged through the woods straight into a Bacchanalia. Driven to a frenzy the participants thought Pentheus was a boar and attacked him. His mother was the first one to spear him and then the group tore his flesh apart with their bare hands.

In Oppian&#x27;s version, Dionysus&#x27;s female followers ask the god to transform them into leopards, and he grants their request, while simultaneously changing Pentheus into a bull. The leopards then attack and tear apart the bull, killing Pentheus, as Oppian presents the metaphors and illusions from &quot;The Bacchae&quot; as literal.

==In classical history==
According to a biography written by the ancient historian Plutarch, after his defeat and death at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC, the head of Roman general and statesman Marcus Licinius Crassus was sent to the Parthian emperor Orodes II and used &quot;as a prop, standing in for the head of&quot; Pentheus in a production of Euripides&#x27; &quot;The Bacchae&quot;.

== In modern popular culture ==
King Pentheus appears in &quot;Bacchae&quot;, a classical Meitei language play based on the ancient Greek tragedy of the same title. In the play, as distinct from the original tragedy, King Pentheus is portrayed as a small community, whose chances of survival is highly unpredictable and doubtful, affected by the massive globalization results of the developed countries (depicted by God Dionysus).

Lithuanian is closely related to neighbouring Latvian, though the two languages are not mutually intelligible. It is written in a Latin script. In some respects, some linguists consider it to be the most conservative of the existing Indo-European languages, retaining features of the Proto-Indo-European language that had disappeared through development from other descendant languages.

==History==

Among Indo-European languages, Lithuanian is conservative in its grammar and phonology, retaining archaic features otherwise found only in ancient languages such as Sanskrit (particularly its early form, Vedic Sanskrit) or Ancient Greek. Thus, it is an important source for the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European language despite its late attestation (with the earliest texts dating only to , whereas Ancient Greek was first written down about three thousand years earlier in c.1450 BC).
According to hydronyms of Baltic origin, the Baltic languages were spoken in a large area east of the Baltic Sea, and in c.1000 BC it had two linguistic units: western and eastern. According to glottochronological research, the Eastern Baltic languages split from the Western Baltic ones between c.400 BC and c.600 BC. The Greek geographer Ptolemy had already written of two Baltic tribe/nations by name, the Galindai () and Sudinoi (), in the 2nd century AD. Lithuanian originated from the Eastern Baltic subgroup and remained nearly unchanged until c.1 AD, however in c.500 AD the language of the northern part of Eastern Balts was influenced by the Finnic languages, which fueled the development of changes from the language of the Southern Balts (see: Latgalian, which developed into Latvian, and extinct Curonian, Semigallian, and Selonian). The language of Southern Balts was less influenced by this process and retained many of its older features, which form Lithuanian.
The differentiation between Lithuanian and Latvian started after c.800 AD; for a long period, they could be considered dialects of a single language. At a minimum, transitional dialects existed until the 14th or 15th century and perhaps as late as the 17th century. The German Livonian Brothers of the Sword occupied the western part of the Daugava basin, which resulted in colonization of the territory of modern Latvia (at the time it was called Terra Mariana) by Germans and had a significant influence on the language&#x27;s independent development due to Germanisation (see also: Baltic Germans and Baltic German nobility).

There was fascination with the Lithuanian people and their language among the late 19th-century researchers, and the philologist Isaac Taylor wrote the following in his &quot;The Origin of the Aryans&quot; (1892):
&quot;Thus it would seem that the Lithuanians have the best claim to represent the primitive Aryan race, as their language exhibits fewer of those phonetic changes, and of those grammatical losses which are consequent on the acquirement of a foreign speech.&quot;

Lithuanian was studied by several linguists such as Franz Bopp, August Schleicher, Adalbert Bezzenberger, Louis Hjelmslev, Ferdinand de Saussure, Winfred P. Lehmann and Vladimir Toporov, Jan Safarewicz, and others. 

By studying place names of Lithuanian origin, linguist concluded that the eastern boundaries of Lithuanian used to be in the shape of zigzags through Grodno, Shchuchyn, Lida, Valozhyn, Svir, and Braslaw. Such eastern boundaries partly coincide with the spread of Catholic and Orthodox faith, and should have existed at the time of the Christianization of Lithuania in 1387 and later. Safarewicz&#x27;s eastern boundaries were moved even further to the south and east by other scholars (e.g. , , , Aleksandras Vanagas, Zigmas Zinkevičius, and others).

Proto-Balto-Slavic branched off directly from Proto-Indo-European, then sub-branched into Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic. Proto-Baltic branched off into Proto-West Baltic and Proto-East Baltic. The Baltic languages passed through a Proto-Balto-Slavic stage, from which the Baltic languages retain exclusive and non-exclusive lexical, morphological, phonological and accentual isoglosses in common with the Slavic languages, which represent their closest living Indo-European relatives. Moreover, with Lithuanian being so archaic in phonology, Slavic words can often be deduced from Lithuanian by regular sound laws; for example, Lith. &quot;&quot; and Polish ← PBSl. (cf. PSl. ) ← PIE , all meaning &quot;wolf&quot;.

Initially, Lithuanian was a spoken language in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Duchy of Prussia, while the beginning of Lithuanian writing is possibly associated with the introduction of Christianity in Lithuania when Mindaugas was baptized and crowned King of Lithuania in 1250–1251. It is believed that prayers were translated into the local dialect of Lithuanian by Franciscan monks during the baptism of Mindaugas, however none of the writings has survived. The first recorded Lithuanian word, reported to have been said on 24 December 1207 from the chronicle of Henry of Latvia, was &quot;Ba&quot;, an interjection of a Lithuanian raider after he found no loot to pillage in a Livonian church.
Although no writings in Lithuanian have survived from the 15th century or earlier, Lithuanian () was mentioned as one of the European languages of the participants in the Council of Constance in 1414–1418. From the middle of the 15th century, the legend spread about the Roman origin of the Lithuanian nobility (from the Palemon lineage), and the closeness of the Lithuanian language and Latin, thus this let some intellectuals in the mid-16th century to advocate for replacement of Ruthenian with Latin, as they considered Latin as the native language of Lithuanians.

Initially, Latin and Church Slavonic were the main written (chancellery) languages of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, but in the late 17th century – 18th century Church Slavonic was replaced with Polish. Nevertheless, Lithuanian was a spoken language of the medieval Lithuanian rulers from the Gediminids dynasty and its cadet branches: Kęstutaičiai and Jagiellonian dynasties. It is known that Jogaila, being ethnic Lithuanian by the male-line, himself knew and spoke Lithuanian with Vytautas the Great, his cousin from the Gediminids dynasty. During the Christianization of Samogitia none of the clergy, who arrived to Samogitia with Jogaila, were able to communicate with the natives, therefore Jogaila himself taught the Samogitians about Catholicism; thus he was able to communicate in the Samogitian dialect of Lithuanian. Soon afterwards Vytautas the Great wrote in his 11 March 1420 letter to Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, that Lithuanian and Samogitian are the same language.
The use of Lithuanian continued at the Lithuanian royal court after the deaths of Vytautas the Great (1430) and Jogaila (1434). For example, since the young Grand Duke Casimir IV Jagiellon was underage, the supreme control over the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was in the hands of the Lithuanian Council of Lords, presided by Jonas Goštautas, while Casimir IV Jagiellon was taught Lithuanian and customs of Lithuania by appointed court officials. During the Polish szlachta&#x27;s envoys visit to Casimir in 1446, they noticed that in Casimir&#x27;s royal court the Lithuanian-speaking courtiers were mandatory, alongside the Polish courtiers. Casimir IV Jagiellon&#x27;s son Saint Casimir, who was subsequently announced as patron saint of Lithuania, was a polyglot and among other languages knew Lithuanian. Grand Duke Alexander Jagiellon also could understand and speak Lithuanian as multiple Lithuanian priests served in his royal chapel and he also maintained a Lithuanian court. In 1501, Erazm Ciołek, a priest of the Vilnius Cathedral, explained to the Pope that the Lithuanians preserve their language and ensure respect to it (), but they also use the Ruthenian language for simplicity reasons because it is spoken by almost half of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A note written by Sigismund von Herberstein in the first half of the 16th century states that, in an ocean of Ruthenian in this part of Europe, there were two non-Ruthenian regions: Lithuania and Samogitia where its inhabitants spoke their own language, but many Ruthenians were also living among them.
The earliest surviving written Lithuanian text is a translation dating from about 1503–1525 of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, the Hail Mary, and the Nicene Creed written in the Southern Aukštaitian dialect. Since 1530–1560 Prussian Lithuanians were taught in native Lithuanian language in parishes and peasants schools of Lithuania Minor, and in 200 years the authorities of the Duchy of Prussia have not taken obstructive measures against such education. On 8 January 1547 the first Lithuanian book was printed – the &quot;Catechism&quot; of Martynas Mažvydas.

At the royal courts in Vilnius of Sigismund II Augustus, the last Grand Duke of Lithuania prior to the Union of Lublin, both Polish and Lithuanian were spoken equally widely. In 1552 Sigismund II Augustus ordered that orders of the Magistrate of Vilnius be announced in Lithuanian, Polish, and Ruthenian. The same requirement was valid for the Magistrate of Kaunas.

In the 16th century, following the decline of Ruthenian usage in favor of Polish in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Lithuanian language strengthened its positions in Lithuania due to reforms in religious matters and judicial reforms which allowed lower levels of the Lithuanian nobility to participate in the social-political life of the state. In 1599, Mikalojus Daukša published his Postil and in its prefaces he expressed that the Lithuanian language situation had improved and thanked bishop Merkelis Giedraitis for his works.

The early 18th century was devastating for the Lithuanian speakers as the Great Northern War plague outbreak in 1700–1721 killed 49% of residents in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1/3 of residents in Lithuania proper and up to 1/2 of residents in Samogitia) and 53% of residents in Lithuania Minor (more than 90% of the deceased were Prussian Lithuanians). On the other hand, Lithuanian language seminars were established in the University of Königsberg (1718) and in the Prussian University of Halle (1727).

Until 1741 in the Lithuanian Province () of the Kingdom of Prussia, which encompassed the counties of Klaipėda, Tilsit, Ragnit, Insterburg, there were 275 Lithuanian primary schools (in multinational areas separate classes were formed for Lithuanian and German speakers), in 1800 – 411 Lithuanian schools.

In 1776–1790 about 1,000 copies of the first Catholic primer in Lithuanian – &quot;Mokslas skaitymo rašto lietuviško&quot; – were issued annually, and it continued to be published until 1864. Over 15,000 copies appeared in total. The Constitution of 3 May 1791 was translated into the Lithuanian language shortly after its adoption by the Great Sejm. During the Kościuszko Uprising (1794) directive documents were distributed and appeals were published in various languages, including Lithuanian, also the Lithuanian language was used for sermons dedicated to the uprising (e.g. preached at Church of St. Johns, Vilnius and other churches, as well as in military units).
In 1864, following the January Uprising, Mikhail Muravyov, the Russian Governor General of Lithuania, banned the language in education and publishing and barred use of the Latin alphabet altogether, although books continued to be printed in Lithuanian across the border in East Prussia and in the United States. Brought into the country by book smugglers () despite the threat of long prison sentences, they helped fuel growing nationalist sentiment that finally led to the lifting of the ban in 1904. According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897 (at the height of the Lithuanian press ban), 53.5% of Lithuanians (10 years and older) were literate, while the average of the Russian Empire was only 24–27.7% (in the European part of Russia the average was 30%, in Poland – 40.7%). In the Russian Empire Lithuanian children were mostly educated by their parents or in secret schools by &quot;daractors&quot; in native Lithuanian language, while only 6.9% attended Russian state schools due to resistance to Russification. Russian governorates with significant Lithuanian populations had one of the highest population literacy rates: Vilna Governorate (in 1897 ~23.6–50% Lithuanian of whom 37% were literate), Kovno Governorate (in 1897 66% Lithuanian of whom 55.3% were literate), Suwałki Governorate (in 1897 in counties of the governorate where Lithuanian population was dominant 76,6% of males and 50,2% of females were literate).

In 1872, the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck started Germanisation policies () after finishing the unification of Germany and the Lithuanian language education in primary schools of Lithuania Minor was started to be replaced with German, however due to parents protests the Lithuanian language education remained alongside German until the late 19th century.

Jonas Jablonskis (1860–1930) made significant contributions to the formation of standard Lithuanian. The conventions of written Lithuanian had been evolving during the 19th century, but Jablonskis, in the introduction to his &quot;Lietuviškos kalbos gramatika&quot;, was the first to formulate and expound the essential principles that were so indispensable to its later development. His proposal for Standard Lithuanian was based on his native Western Aukštaitian dialect with some features of the eastern Prussian Lithuanians&#x27; dialect spoken in Lithuania Minor. These dialects had preserved archaic phonetics mostly intact due to the influence of the neighbouring Old Prussian, while other dialects had experienced different phonetic shifts.
Lithuanian became the official language of the country following the restoration of Lithuania&#x27;s statehood in 1918. The 1922 Constitution of Lithuania (the first permanent Lithuanian constitution) recognized it as the sole official language of the state and mandated its use throughout the state. The improvement of education system during the interwar period resulted in 92% of literacy rate of the population in Lithuania in 1939 (those still illiterate were mostly elderly).

Following the Żeligowski&#x27;s Mutiny in 1920, Vilnius Region was detached from Lithuania and was eventually annexed by Poland in 1922. This resulted in repressions of Lithuanians and mass-closure of Lithuanian language schools in the Vilnius Region, especially when Vilnius Voivode Ludwik Bociański issued a secret memorandum of 11 February 1936 which stated the measures for suppressing the Lithuanians in the region. Some Lithuanian historians, like and Ereminas Gintautas, consider these Polish policies as amounting to an &quot;ethnocide of Lithuanians&quot;.

Between 1862 and 1944, the Lithuanian schools were completely banned in Lithuania Minor and the language was almost completely eliminated there. The Baltic-origin place names retained their basis for centuries in Prussia but were Germanized (e.g. – , – , – , etc.); however, after the annexation of the Königsberg region into the Russian SFSR, they were changed completely, regardless of previous tradition (e.g. – , – , – , etc.).

The Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940, German occupation in 1941, and eventually Soviet re-occupation in 1944, reduced the independent Republic of Lithuania to the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union. Soviet authorities introduced Lithuanian–Russian bilingualism, and Russian, as the &quot;de facto&quot; official language of the USSR, took precedence and the use of Lithuanian was reduced in a process of Russification. Many Russian-speaking workers and teachers migrated to the Lithuanian SSR (fueled by the industrialization in the Soviet Union). Russian consequently came into use in state institutions: the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania (there were 80% Russians among the 22,000 Communist Party members in the Lithuanian SSR in 1948), radio and television (61–74% of broadcasts were in Russian in 1970). Lithuanians passively resisted Russification and continued to use their own language.

On 18 November 1988, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR restored Lithuanian as the official language of Lithuania, under from the popular pro-independence movement Sąjūdis.

On 11 March 1990, the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania was passed. Lithuanian was recognized as sole official language of Lithuania in the Provisional Basic Law (Lithuanian: &quot;Laikinasis Pagrindinis Įstatymas&quot;) and the Constitution of 1992, written during the Lithuanian constitutional referendum.

==Classification==
Lithuanian is one of two living Baltic languages, along with Latvian, and they constitute the eastern branch of the Baltic languages family. An earlier Baltic language, Old Prussian, was extinct by the 18th century; the other Western Baltic languages, Curonian and Sudovian, became extinct earlier. Some theories, such as that of Jānis Endzelīns, considered that the Baltic languages form their own distinct branch of the family of Indo-European languages, and Endzelīns thought that the similarity between Baltic and Slavic was explicable through language contact. There is also an opinion that suggests the union of Baltic and Slavic languages into a distinct sub-family of Balto-Slavic languages amongst the Indo-European family of languages. Such an opinion was first represented by August Schleicher. Some supporters of the Baltic and Slavic languages unity even claim that Proto-Baltic branch did not exist, suggesting that Proto-Balto-Slavic split into three language groups: East Baltic, West Baltic and Proto-Slavic. Antoine Meillet and Jan Baudouin de Courtenay, on the contrary, believed that the similarity between the Slavic and Baltic languages was caused by independent parallel development, and the Proto-Balto-Slavic language did not exist.
An attempt to reconcile the opposing stances was made by Jan Michał Rozwadowski. He proposed that the two language groups were indeed a unity after the division of Indo-European, but also suggested that after the two had divided into separate entities (Baltic and Slavic), they had posterior contact. The genetic kinship view is augmented by the fact that Proto-Balto-Slavic is easily reconstructible with important proofs in historic prosody. The alleged (or certain, as certain as historical linguistics can be) similarities due to contact are seen in such phenomena as the existence of definite adjectives formed by the addition of an inflected pronoun (descended from the same Proto-Indo-European pronoun), which exist in both Baltic and Slavic yet nowhere else in the Indo-European family (languages such as Albanian and the Germanic languages developed definite adjectives independently), and that is not reconstructible for Proto-Balto-Slavic, meaning that they most probably developed through language contact.

The Baltic hydronyms area stretches from the Vistula River in the west to the east of Moscow and from the Baltic Sea in the north to the south of Kyiv. Vladimir Toporov and Oleg Trubachyov (1961, 1962) studied Baltic hydronyms in Russian and Ukrainian territory. Hydronyms and archaeology analysis show that the Slavs started migrating to the Baltic areas east and north-east directions in the 6–7th centuries, before then, the Baltic and Slavic boundary was south of the Pripyat River. In the 1960s, Vladimir Toporov and Vyacheslav Ivanov made the following conclusions about the relationship between the Baltic and Slavic languages:
* a) Proto-Slavic formed from the peripheral-type Baltic dialects; 
* b) the Slavic linguistic type formed later from the structural model of the Baltic languages; 
* c) the Slavic structural model is a result of a transformation of the structural model of the Baltic languages.

These scholars&#x27; theses do not contradict the Baltic and Slavic languages closeness and from a historical perspective, specify the Baltic-Slavic languages&#x27; evolution.

So, there are at least six points of view on the relationships between the Baltic and Slavic. However, as for the hypotheses related to the &quot;Balto-Slavic problem&quot;, it is noted that they are more focused on personal theoretical constructions and deviate to some extent from the comparative method.

==Geographic distribution==
Lithuanian is spoken mainly in Lithuania. It is also spoken by ethnic Lithuanians living in today&#x27;s Belarus, Latvia, Poland, and the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, as well as by sizable emigrant communities in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uruguay, and Spain.

2,955,200 people in Lithuania (including 3,460 Tatars), or about 86% of the 2015 population, are native Lithuanian speakers; most Lithuanian inhabitants of other nationalities also speak Lithuanian to some extent. The total worldwide Lithuanian-speaking population is about 3,200,000.

===Official status===
Lithuanian is the state language of Lithuania and an official language of the European Union.

===Dialects===
In the &quot;Compendium Grammaticae Lithvanicae&quot;, published in 1673, three dialects of Lithuanian are distinguished: Samogitian dialect () of Samogitia, Royal Lithuania () and Ducal Lithuania (). Ducal Lithuanian is described as pure (), half-Samogitian () and having elements of Curonian (). Authors of the &quot;Compendium Grammaticae Lithvanicae&quot; singled out that the Lithuanians of the Vilnius Region () tend to speak harshly, almost like Austrians, Bavarians and others speak German in Germany.

Due to the historical circumstances of Lithuania, Lithuanian-speaking territory was divided into Lithuania proper and Lithuania Minor, therefore, in the 16th–17th centuries, three regional variants of the common language emerged. Lithuanians in Lithuania Minor spoke Western Aukštaitian dialect with specifics of Įsrutis and Ragainė environs (e.g. works of Martynas Mažvydas, Jonas Bretkūnas, Jonas Rėza, and Daniel Klein&#x27;s &quot;Grammatica Litvanica&quot;). The other two regional variants of the common language were formed in Lithuania proper: middle, which was based on the specifics of the Duchy of Samogitia (e.g. works of Mikalojus Daukša, Merkelis Petkevičius, Steponas Jaugelis‑Telega, Samuelis Boguslavas Chylinskis, and Mikołaj Rej&#x27;s Lithuanian postil), and eastern, based on the specifics of Eastern Aukštaitians, living in Vilnius and its region (e.g. works of Konstantinas Sirvydas, Jonas Jaknavičius, and Robert Bellarmine&#x27;s catechism). In Vilnius University, there are preserved texts written in the Lithuanian language of the Vilnius area, a dialect of Eastern Aukštaitian, which was spoken in a territory located south-eastwards from Vilnius: the sources are preserved in works of graduates from Stanislovas Rapolionis-based Lithuanian language schools, graduate Martynas Mažvydas and Rapalionis relative Abraomas Kulvietis. The development of Lithuanian in Lithuania Minor, especially in the 18th century, was successful due to many publications and research. In contrast, the development of Lithuanian in Lithuania proper was obstructed due to the Polonization of the Lithuanian nobility, especially in the 18th century, and it was being influenced by the Samogitian dialect. The Lithuanian-speaking population was also dramatically decreased by the Great Northern War plague outbreak in 1700–1721 which killed 49% of residents in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1/3 of residents in Lithuania proper and up to 1/2 of residents in Samogitia) and 53% of residents in Lithuania Minor (more than 90% of the deceased were Prussian Lithuanians). Since the 19th century to 1925 the amount of Lithuanian speakers in Lithuania Minor (excluding Klaipėda Region) decreased from 139,000 to 8,000 due to Germanisation and colonization.
As a result of a decrease in the usage of spoken Lithuanian in the eastern part of Lithuania proper, in the 19th century, it was suggested to create a standardized Lithuanian based on the Samogitian dialect. Nevertheless, it was not accomplished because everyone offered their Samogitian subdialects and the Eastern and Western Aukštaitians offered their Aukštaitian subdialects.
In the second half of the 19th century, when the Lithuanian National Revival intensified, and the preparations to publish a Lithuanian periodical press were taking place, the mostly south-western Aukštaitian revival writers did not use the 19th-century Lithuanian of Lithuania Minor as it was largely Germanized. Instead, they used a more pure Lithuanian language which has been described by August Schleicher and Friedrich Kurschat and this way the written language of Lithuania Minor was transferred to resurgent Lithuania. The most famous standardizer of the Lithuanian, Jonas Jablonskis, established the south-western Aukštaitian dialect, including the Eastern dialect of Lithuania Minor, as the basis of standardized Lithuanian in the 20th century, which led to him being nicknamed the father of standardized Lithuanian.

According to Polish professor Jan Otrębski&#x27;s article published in 1931, the Polish dialect in the Vilnius Region and in the northeastern areas in general are very interesting variant of the Polish language as this dialect developed in a foreign territory which was mostly inhabited by the Lithuanians who were Belarusized (mostly) or Polonized, and to prove this Otrębski provided examples of Lithuanianisms in the Tutejszy language. In 2015, Polish linguist attested that many of the Vilnius Region&#x27;s inhabitants who declare Polish nationality speak a Belarusian dialect which they call &quot;mowa prosta&quot; (&#x27;simple speech&#x27;).

Currently, Lithuanian is divided into two dialects: Aukštaitian (Highland Lithuanian), and Samogitian (Lowland Lithuanian). There are significant differences between standard Lithuanian and Samogitian and these are often described as separate languages. The modern Samogitian dialect formed in the 13th–16th centuries under the influence of Curonian. Lithuanian dialects are closely connected with ethnographical regions of Lithuania. Even nowadays Aukštaitians and Samogitians can have considerable difficulties understanding each other if they speak with their dialects and not standard Lithuanian, which is mandatory to learn in the Lithuanian education system.

Dialects are divided into subdialects. Both dialects have three subdialects. Samogitian is divided into West, North and South; Aukštaitian into West (Suvalkiečiai), South (Dzūkian) and East.

==Script==
Lithuanian uses the Latin script supplemented with diacritics. It has 32 letters. In the collation order, &quot;y&quot; follows immediately after &quot;į&quot; (called &quot;i nosinė&quot;), because both &quot;y&quot; and &quot;į&quot; represent the same long vowel :

In addition, the following digraphs are used, but are treated as sequences of two letters for collation purposes. The digraph &quot;ch&quot; represents a single sound, the velar fricative , while &quot;dz&quot; and &quot;dž&quot; are pronounced like straightforward combinations of their component letters (sounds):

Dz dz (dzė), Dž dž (džė), Ch ch (cha).

The distinctive Lithuanian letter &quot;Ė&quot; was used for the first time in the Daniel Klein&#x27;s &quot;Grammatica Litvanica&quot; and firmly established itself in Lithuanian since then. However, linguist August Schleicher used &quot;Ë&quot; (with two points above it) instead of &quot;Ė&quot; for expressing the same. In the &quot;Grammatica Litvanica&quot; Klein also established the letter &quot;W&quot; for marking the sound [v], the use of which was later abolished in Lithuanian (it was replaced with &quot;V&quot;, notably by authors of the &quot;Varpas&quot; newspaper). The usage of &quot;V&quot; instead of &quot;W&quot; especially increased since the early 20th century, likely considerably influenced by Lithuanian press and schools.

The Lithuanian writing system is largely phonemic, i.e., one letter usually corresponds to a single phoneme (sound). There are a few exceptions: for example, the letter &quot;i&quot; represents either the vowel , as in English &quot;sit&quot;, or is silent and merely indicates that the preceding consonant is palatalized. The latter is largely the case when &quot;i&quot; occurs after a consonant and is followed by a back or a central vowel, except in some borrowed words (e.g., the first consonant in &quot;lūpa&quot; , &quot;lip&quot;, is a velarized dental lateral approximant; on the other hand, the first consonant in &quot;liūtas&quot; , &quot;lion&quot;, is a palatalized alveolar lateral approximant; both consonants are followed by the same vowel, the long , and no can be pronounced in &quot;liūtas&quot;).
Due to Polish influence, the Lithuanian alphabet included &quot;sz&quot;, &quot;cz&quot; and the Polish &quot;Ł&quot; for the first sound and regular L (without a following i) for the second: &quot;łupa&quot;, &quot;lutas&quot;. During the Lithuanian National Revival in the 19th century the Polish &quot;Ł&quot; was abolished, while digraphs &quot;sz&quot;, &quot;cz&quot; (that are also common in the Polish orthography) were replaced with &quot;š&quot; and &quot;č&quot; from the Czech orthography because formally they were shorter. Nevertheless, another argument to abolish &quot;sz&quot; and &quot;cz&quot; was to distinguish Lithuanian from Polish. The new letters &quot;š&quot; and &quot;č&quot; were cautiously used in publications intended for more educated readers (e.g. &quot;Varpas&quot;, &quot;Tėvynės sargas&quot;, &quot;Ūkininkas&quot;), however &quot;sz&quot; and &quot;cz&quot; continued to be in use in publications intended for less educated readers as they caused tension in society and prevailed only after 1906.

The Lithuanians also adopted the letter &quot;ž&quot; from the Czechs.

The nasal vowels &quot;ą&quot; and &quot;ę&quot; were taken from the Polish spelling and began to be used by Renaissance Lithuanian writers, later the Lithuanians introduced the nasal vowels &quot;į&quot; and &quot;ų&quot; as analogues. The letter &quot;ū&quot; is the latest addition by linguist Jonas Jablonskis.

A macron (on &quot;u&quot;), an ogonek (on &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;), a dot (on &quot;e&quot;), and &quot;y&quot; (in place of &quot;i&quot;) are used for grammatical and historical reasons and always denote vowel length in Modern Standard Lithuanian. Acute, grave, and tilde diacritics are used to indicate pitch accents. However, these pitch accents are generally not written, except in dictionaries, grammars, and where needed for clarity, such as to differentiate homonyms and dialectal use.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===

All Lithuanian consonants except have two variants: one non-palatalized and one palatalized, for example,  – ,  – ,  – (see the chart above for the full consonant set, represented by IPA symbols). The consonants , , and their palatalized counterparts are only found in loanwords.

 have been traditionally transcribed with , but they can be seen as equivalent transcriptions, with the former set being somewhat easier to write.

===Vowels===

Lithuanian has six long vowels and four short ones (not including disputed phonemes marked in brackets). Length has traditionally been considered the distinctive feature, though short vowels are also more centralized and long vowels more peripheral:

* are restricted to loanwords. Many speakers merge the former with .

===Diphthongs===
Lithuanian is traditionally described as having nine diphthongs, &quot;ai&quot;,&quot; au&quot;,&quot; ei&quot;,&quot; eu&quot;,&quot; oi&quot;,&quot; ou&quot;,&quot; ui&quot;,&quot; ie&quot;, and&quot; uo.&quot; However, some approaches (i.e., Schmalstieg 1982) treat them as vowel sequences rather than diphthongs; indeed, the longer component depends on the type of stress, whereas in diphthongs, the longer segment is fixed.

===Pitch accent===
The Lithuanian prosodic system is characterized by free accent and distinctive quantity (i.e. syllable weight). The word prosody of Lithuanian is sometimes described as a restricted tone system, also called a pitch accent system. In Lithuanian, lexical words contain a single syllable that is prominent or stressed. Among those, heavy syllables – that is, those containing a long vowel, diphthong, or a sonorant coda – bear either one of two tones: a falling (or &quot;acute tone&quot;) or a rising (or &quot;circumflex tone&quot;). Light syllables (syllables with short vowels and optionally also obstruent codas) do not have the two-way contrast of heavy syllables.

==Grammar==


The first prescriptive printed grammar of Lithuanian – &quot;Grammatica Litvanica&quot; was commissioned by the Duke of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm, for use in the Lithuanian-speaking parishes of East Prussia. It was written by Daniel Klein in Latin and was published by Johann Reusner in 1653 in Königsberg, Duchy of Prussia. In ~1643 Christophorus Sapphun wrote the Lithuanian grammar &quot;Compendium Grammaticae Lithvanicae&quot; slightly earlier than Klein, however the edited variant of Sapphun&#x27;s grammar was published only in 1673 by Theophylus Gottlieb Schultz.

In one of the first Lithuanian grammars – &quot;Compendium Grammaticae Lithvanicae&quot;, published in 1673, most of the given examples are with Lithuanian endings (e.g. names Jonas = Jonas, Jonuttis = Jonutis, etc.), therefore it allows to highlight the tendency of spelling the endings of words in the Old Lithuanian writings.

The &quot;Universitas lingvarum Litvaniae&quot;, published in Vilnius in 1737, is the oldest surviving grammar of Lithuanian published in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

The first scientific &quot;Compendium of Lithuanian&quot; was published in German in 1856/57 by August Schleicher, a professor at Charles University in Prague. In it he describes Prussian-Lithuanian, which later became the &quot;skeleton&quot; (Būga) of modern Lithuanian. Schleicher asserted that Lithuanian can compete with the Greek and Roman (Old Latin) languages in perfection of forms.

Lithuanian is a highly inflected language. In Lithuanian, there are two grammatical genders for nouns (masculine and feminine) and three genders for adjectives, pronouns, numerals and participles (masculine, feminine and neuter). Every attribute must agree with the gender and number of the noun. The neuter forms of other parts of speech are used with a subject of an undefined gender (a pronoun, an infinitive etc.).

There are twelve noun and five adjective declensions and one (masculine and feminine) participle declension.

Nouns and other parts of nominal morphology are declined in seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative (inessive), and vocative. In older Lithuanian texts, three additional varieties of the locative case are found: illative, adessive and allative. The most common are the illative, which is still used, mostly in spoken language, and the allative, which survives in the standard language in some idiomatic usages. The adessive is nearly extinct. These additional cases are probably due to the influence of Uralic languages, with which Baltic languages have had a longstanding contact. (Uralic languages possess a great variety of noun cases, a number of which are specialised locative cases.)

Lithuanian verbal morphology shows a number of innovations; namely, the loss of synthetic passive (which is hypothesized based on other archaic Indo-European languages, such as Greek and Latin), synthetic perfect (formed by means of reduplication) and aorist; forming subjunctive and imperative with the use of suffixes plus flexions as opposed to solely flections in, e.g., Ancient Greek; loss of the optative mood; merging and disappearing of the -&quot;t&quot;- and -&quot;nt&quot;- markers for the third-person singular and plural, respectively (this, however, occurs in Latvian and Old Prussian as well and may indicate a collective feature of all Baltic languages).

On the other hand, Lithuanian verbal morphology retains a number of archaic features absent from most modern Indo-European languages (but shared with Latvian). This includes the synthetic form of the future tense with the help of the -&quot;s&quot;- suffix and three principal verbal forms with the present tense stem employing the -&quot;n&quot;- and -&quot;st&quot;- infixes.

There are three verbal conjugations. The verb &quot;būti&quot; is the only auxiliary verb in the language. Together with participles, it is used to form dozens of compound forms.

In the active voice, each verb can be inflected for any of the following moods:

# Indicative
# Indirect
# Imperative
# Conditional/subjunctive

In the indicative mood and indirect moods, all verbs can have eleven tenses:

# simple: present (e.g., &quot;nešu&quot; &#x27;I carry&#x27;), past (&quot;nešiau&quot;), past iterative (&quot;nešdavau&quot;) and future (&quot;nešiu&quot;)
# compound:
## present perfect (&quot;esu nešęs&quot;), past perfect (&quot;buvau nešęs&quot;), past iterative perfect (&quot;būdavau nešęs&quot;), future perfect (&quot;būsiu nešęs&quot;)
## past inchoative (&quot;buvau benešąs&quot;), past iterative inchoative (&quot;būdavau benešąs&quot;), future inchoative (&quot;būsiu benešąs&quot;)

The indirect mood, used only in written narrative speech, has the same tenses corresponding to the appropriate active participle in nominative case; e.g., the past of the indirect mood would be &quot;nešęs&quot;, while the past iterative inchoative of the indirect mood would be &quot;būdavęs benešąs&quot;. Since it is a nominal form, this mood cannot be conjugated but must match the subject&#x27;s number and gender.

The subjunctive (or conditional) and the imperative moods have three tenses. Subjunctive: present (&quot;neščiau&quot;), past (&quot;būčiau nešęs&quot;), inchoative (&quot;būčiau benešąs&quot;); imperative: present (&quot;nešk&quot;), perfect (&quot;būk nešęs&quot;) and inchoative (&quot;būk benešąs&quot;).

The infinitive has only one form (&quot;nešti&quot;). These forms, except the infinitive and indirect mood, are conjugative, having two singular, two plural persons, and the third person form common both for plural and singular.

In the passive voice, the form number is not as rich as in the active voice. There are two types of passive voice in Lithuanian: present participle (type I) and past participle (type II) (in the examples below types I and II are separated with a slash). They both have the same moods and tenses:

# Indicative mood: present (&quot;esu nešamas/neštas&quot;), past (&quot;buvau nešamas/neštas&quot;), past iterative (&quot;būdavau nešamas/neštas&quot;) and future (&quot;būsiu nešamas/neštas&quot;)
# Indirect mood: present (&quot;esąs nešamas/neštas&quot;), past (&quot;buvęs nešamas/neštas&quot;), past iterative (&quot;būdavęs nešamas/neštas&quot;) and future (&quot;būsiąs nešamas/neštas&quot;).
# Imperative mood: present (type I only: &quot;būk nešamas&quot;), past (type II only: &quot;būk neštas&quot;).
# Subjunctive / conditional mood: present (type I only: &quot;būčiau nešamas&quot;), past (type II only: &quot;būčiau neštas&quot;).

Lithuanian has the richest participle system of all Indo-European languages, having participles derived from all simple tenses with distinct active and passive forms, and two gerund forms.

In practical terms, the rich overall inflectional system makes the word order have a different meaning than in more analytic languages such as English. The English phrase &quot;a car is coming&quot; translates as &quot;atvažiuoja automobilis&quot; (the theme first), while &quot;the car is coming&quot; – &quot;automobilis atvažiuoja&quot; (the theme first; word order inversion).

Lithuanian also has a very rich word derivation system and an array of diminutive suffixes.

Today there are two definitive books on Lithuanian grammar: one in English, the &quot;Introduction to Modern Lithuanian&quot; (called &quot;Beginner&#x27;s Lithuanian&quot; in its newer editions) by Leonardas Dambriūnas, Antanas Klimas and William R. Schmalstieg; and another in Russian, Vytautas Ambrazas&#x27; &quot;Грамматика литовского языка&quot; (&quot;Lithuanian Grammar&quot;). Another recent book on Lithuanian grammar is the second edition of &quot;Review of Modern Lithuanian Grammar&quot; by Edmund Remys, published by Lithuanian Research and Studies Center, Chicago, 2003.

==Vocabulary==

===Indo-European vocabulary===
Lithuanian retains cognates to many words found in classical languages, such as Sanskrit and Latin. These words are descended from Proto-Indo-European. A few examples are the following:

* Lith. and Skt. (son)
* Lith. and Skt. and Lat. &quot;ovis&quot; (sheep)
* Lith. and Skt. &quot;dhūma&quot; and Lat. &quot;fumus&quot; (fumes, smoke)
* Lith. and Skt. (second, the other)
* Lith. and Skt. &quot;vṛka&quot; (wolf)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;rota&quot; (wheel) and Skt. &quot;ratha&quot; (carriage)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;senex&quot; (an old man) and Skt. &quot;sanas&quot; (old)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;vir&quot; (a man) and Skt. &quot;vīra&quot; (man)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;anguis&quot; (a snake in Latin, a species of snakes in Lithuanian)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;linum&quot; (flax, compare with English &#x27;linen&#x27;)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;aro&quot; (I plow)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;iungo&quot;, and Skt. &quot;yuñje&quot; (mid.), (I join)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;gentes&quot; and Skt. &quot;játi&quot; (tribes)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;mensis&quot; and Skt. &quot;masa&quot; (month)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;dens&quot; and Skt. &quot;danta&quot; (tooth)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;noctes&quot; (plural of &quot;nox&quot;) and Skt. &quot;naktam&quot; (night)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;ignis&quot; and Skt. &quot;agni&quot; (fire)
* Lith. and Lat. &quot;sedemus&quot; and Skt. &quot;sīdama&quot; (we sit)

This even extends to grammar, where for example Latin noun declensions ending in &quot;-um&quot; often correspond to Lithuanian &quot;-ų&quot;, with the Latin and Lithuanian fourth declensions being particularly close. Many of the words from this list are similar to other Indo-European languages, including English and Russian. The contribution of Lithuanian was influential in the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European.

Lexical and grammatical similarities between Baltic and Slavic languages suggest an affinity between these two language groups. On the other hand, there exist a number of Baltic (particularly Lithuanian) words without counterparts in Slavic languages, but which are similar to words in Sanskrit or Latin. The history of the relationship between Baltic and Slavic languages, and our understanding of the affinity between the two groups, remain in dispute (see: Balto-Slavic languages).

===Loanwords===

In a 1934 book entitled &quot;Die Germanismen des Litauischen. Teil I: Die deutschen Lehnwörter im Litauischen&quot;, K. Alminauskis found 2,770 loanwords, of which about 130 were of uncertain origin. The majority of the loanwords were found to have been derived from Polish, Belarusian, and German, with some evidence that these languages all acquired the words from contacts and trade with Prussia during the era of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Loanwords comprised about 20% of the vocabulary used in the first book printed in Lithuanian in 1547, Martynas Mažvydas&#x27;s &quot;Catechism&quot;. But as a result of language preservation and purging policies, Slavic loanwords currently constitute only 1.5% of the Standard Lithuanian lexicon, while German loanwords constitute only 0.5% of it. The majority of loanwords in the 20th century arrived from Russian.

Towards the end of the 20th century, a number of words and expressions related to new technologies and telecommunications were borrowed from English. The Lithuanian government has an established language policy that encourages the development of equivalent vocabulary to replace loanwords. However, despite the government&#x27;s best efforts to avoid the use of loanwords in Lithuanian, many English words have become accepted and are now included in Lithuanian language dictionaries. In particular, words having to do with new technologies have permeated the Lithuanian vernacular, including such words as:

* Monitorius (vaizduoklis) (computer monitor)
* Faksas (fax)
* Kompiuteris (computer)
* Failas (byla, rinkmena) (electronic file)

Other common foreign words have also been adopted by Lithuanian. Some of these include:

* Taksi (taxi)
* Pica (pizza)
* Alkoholis (alcohol)
* Bankas (bank)
* Pasas (passport, pass)
* Parkas (park)

These words have been modified to suit the grammatical and phonetic requirements of Lithuanian, mostly by adding -as ending, but their foreign roots are obvious.

==Old Lithuanian==



The language of the earliest Lithuanian writings, in the 16th and 17th centuries, is known as Old Lithuanian and differs in some significant respects from the Lithuanian of today.

Besides the specific differences given below, nouns, verbs, and adjectives still had separate endings for the dual number. The dual persists today in some dialects. Example:

===Pronunciation===
The vowels written &quot;ą, ę, į, ų&quot; were still pronounced as long nasal vowels, not as long oral vowels as in today&#x27;s Lithuanian.

The original Baltic long &quot;ā&quot; was still retained as such, e.g. &quot;bralis&quot; &#x27;brother&#x27; (modern &quot;brólis&quot;).

===Nouns===
Compared to modern Lithuanian, there were three additional cases. The original locative case had been replaced by four so-called &quot;postpositive&quot; cases, the inessive case, illative case, adessive case and allative case, which correspond to the prepositions &quot;in&quot;, &quot;into&quot;, &quot;at&quot; and &quot;towards&quot;, respectively. They were formed by affixing a postposition to one of the previous cases:

* The inessive added &quot;*-en&quot; &gt; &quot;-e&quot; to the original locative in singular and to the accusative in plural.
* The illative added &quot;*-nā&quot; &gt; to the accusative.
* The adessive added &quot;*-pie&quot; &gt; &quot;-p(i)&quot; to the original locative in singular and to the inessive in plural.
* The allative added &quot;*-pie&quot; &gt; &quot;-p(i)&quot; to the genitive.

The inessive has become the modern locative case, while the other three have disappeared. Note, however, that the illative case is still used occasionally in the colloquial language (mostly in the singular): &quot;Lietuvon&quot; &#x27;to Lithuania&#x27;, &quot;miestan&quot; &#x27;to the city&#x27;. This form is relatively productive: for instance, it is not uncommon to hear &quot;skrendame Niujorkan (we are flying to New York)&quot;. There are some words still used in adessive case: esu &quot;namie&quot; (could be equally substituted with &quot;namuose&quot;) I&#x27;m &#x27;at home&#x27;.

The uncontracted dative plural &quot;-mus&quot; was still common.

===Adjectives===
Adjectives could belong to all four accent classes in Old Lithuanian (now they can only belong to classes 3 and 4).

Additional remnants of i-stem adjectives still existed, e.g.:

* loc. sg. &#x27;in the big crowd&#x27; (now )
* loc. sg. &quot;gerèsnime&quot; &#x27;better&#x27; (now &quot;geresniamè&quot;)
* loc. sg. &quot;mažiáusime&quot; &#x27;smallest&#x27; (now &quot;mažiáusiame&quot;)

Additional remnants of u-stem adjectives still existed, e.g. &quot;rūgštùs&quot; &#x27;sour&#x27;:

No u-stem remnants existed in the dative singular and locative plural.

Definite adjectives, originally involving a pronoun suffixed to an adjective, had not merged into a single word in Old Lithuanian. Examples:

* &quot;pa-jo-prasto&quot; &#x27;ordinary&#x27; (now &quot;pàprastojo&quot;)
* &quot;nu-jie-vargę&quot; &#x27;tired&#x27; (now &quot;nuvar̃gusieji&quot;)

===Verbs===
The Proto-Indo-European class of athematic verbs still existed in Old Lithuanian:

The optative mood (i.e. the third-person imperative) still had its own endings, &quot;-ai&quot; for third-conjugation verbs and &quot;-ie&quot; for other verbs, instead of using regular third-person present endings.

===Syntax===
Word order was freer in Old Lithuanian. For example, a noun in the genitive case could either precede or follow the noun it modifies.

The Prime Minister acts as head of government and is appointed by the President, chosen from the majority party in the National Assembly. Executive power is exercised by the President and Prime Minister who together constitute the government.

==Government==
The government of Haiti is a semi-presidential republic, a multiparty system wherein the President of Haiti is head of state elected directly by popular elections. The Prime Minister acts as head of government and is appointed by the President, chosen from the majority party in the National Assembly. Executive power is exercised by the President and Prime Minister who together constitute the government.

Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the National Assembly of Haiti. The government is organized unitarily, thus the central government &quot;delegates&quot; powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent. The current structure of Haiti&#x27;s political system was set forth in the Constitution of Haiti on 29 March 1987. The current president is Claude Joseph, acting in 2021.
In 2010, there were 7,000 people in the Haitian National Police.

The Institute for the Protection of National Heritage has preserved 33 historical monuments and the historic center of Cap-Haïtien.

The legal system for torts is based on a version of the Napoleonic Code.

In 2013, the annual budget was US$1 billion.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
Jean-Jacques Dessalines was the first leader of free and independent Haiti under the 1805 constitution. He was initially regarded as governor-general, then later called himself Emperor Jacques I of Haiti. His regime lasted two and half years (1804-1806) and ended with his assassination by disaffected leaders of his administration. In 1806, Constituent Assembly created a new constitution and appointed Henri Christophe to a four-year term as President of the Republic of Haiti. The following year, the Battle of Sibert ended with the division of Haiti into the southern Republic of Haiti under Alexandre Pétion and the northern State of Haiti under Christophe. In 1818, Pétion died of a fever and Jean-Pierre Boyer, Chief of the Presidential Guard, was appointed President-for-Life of the Republic of Haiti. After Christophe committed suicide in 1820, Boyer promulgates the Republican Constitution in Christophe&#x27;s northern state. This resulted in the unification of northern and southern Haiti. In 1822, Boyer arrives in Santo Domingo and declares control over the entire island of Hispaniola. Under Boyer, King Charles X of France signs an ordinance which conditionally recognizes Haiti&#x27;s independence and imposes a 150 million franc indemnity on the Haitian government. This debt plagued Haiti&#x27;s economy for generations. in 1843, President Boyer was overthrown and fled to Paris in exile. The 1843 Constitution was established and Charles Riviere-Hérard was appointed President of Haiti. Under Riviere-Hèrard, the Dominican Republic declared its independence from Haiti.

=== 20th century ===
In 1915, the United States Marines, led by Admiral William B. Caperton, entered Port-au-Prince and began the United States occupation of Haiti. The U.S. took over the collection of revenues and banks in Haiti for 19 years. American forces withdraw from Haiti in 1934 marking the end of the U.S. occupation. In 1957, François Duvalier, also known as &quot;Papa Doc&quot;, was elected President of Haiti. In 1964, he declared himself president for life and established that his son, Jean-Claude Duvalier, known as &quot;Baby Doc&quot;, would succeed him. During their regime, opposition to the government was not tolerated; thus, the Duvaliers used violence and terror to suppress the masses, killing about 30,000 Haitians. Finally, in 1986, a series of uprisings forced Baby Doc to flee Haiti for France. The Duvalier family stole millions of dollars during their administration, leaving Haiti in extreme debt today.

=== 21st century ===
On February 29, 2004, a coup d&#x27;état led by the Group of 184 ousted the popularly elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, allegedly with the assistance of the French and United States governments; U.S. and French soldiers were on the ground in Haiti at the time, recently arrived (See controversy).

The first elections since the overthrow were held on February 8, 2006 to elect a new President. René Préval was declared to have won with over 50 percent of the vote. In 2008, Parliament voted to dismiss President Preval&#x27;s Prime Minister following severe rioting over food prices. His selected replacement for the post was rejected by Parliament, throwing the country into a prolonged period without a government.

=== Today ===
Haiti is officially a semi-presidential republic. However, sources such as the Democracy Index have described Haiti as a hybrid or authoritarian regime in practice. Suffrage is universal, for adults over 18.

The constitution was rewritten by the United States to model those of the United States and of France. It was approved in March 1987, but it was completely suspended from June 1988 to March 1989 and was only fully reinstated in October 1994.

==Branches of government==
===Executive branch===

|10 November 2024

Haiti&#x27;s executive branch is composed of two parts, the presidency and the government. In this sense, &quot;government&quot; refers specifically to the portion of the executive branch outside of the presidency, and not to Haiti&#x27;s political system as a whole.

==== President ====
The president is the head of state and elected by popular vote every five years for a five-year term, and may not serve consecutive terms. The last presidential election was held on 20 November 2016. The latest president was Jovenel Moïse until his assassination on 7 July 2021.

The president appoints the prime minister and his cabinet, which must be ratified by the National Assembly.

====Cabinet====
Haiti&#x27;s cabinet, called Council of Ministers, is led by the Prime Minister, and includes other ministers.

The prime minister, the head of government, is appointed by the president and ratified by the National Assembly. He appoints the Ministers and Secretaries of State and goes before the National Assembly to obtain a vote of confidence for his declaration of general policy. The Prime Minister enforces the laws and, along with the President, is responsible for national defense.

The ministries of the Haitian government are:

*Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development
*Ministry of Commerce and Industry
*Ministry of Women&#x27;s Affairs and Women&#x27;s Rights
*Ministry of Culture and Communication
*Ministry of Defense
*Ministry of Economy and Finance
*Ministry of National Education and Vocational Training
*Ministry of Environment
*Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship
*Ministry of Haitians Living Abroad
*Ministry of Public Health and Population
*Ministry of Youth, Sports and Civic Action
*Ministry of Interior and Territorial Communities
*Ministry of Justice and Public Security
*Ministry of Planning and External Cooperation
*Ministry of Public Works, Transportation and Communications
*Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor
*Ministry of Tourism

===Legislative branch===

The bicameral National Assembly of Haiti (Assemblée Nationale) consists of the Chamber of Deputies (Chambre des Députés) and the Senate (Sénat). The Chamber of Deputies has ninety-nine members, who are elected by popular vote for four-year terms. The Senate consists of thirty members elected by popular vote to serve six-year terms, with one third elected every two years.

The last Senate elections were held on 28 November 2010 with run-off elections on 20 March 2011. The following Senate election, for one third of the seats, was to be held in 2012 but was not called. The last election of the Chamber of Deputies was held on 28 November 2010 with run-off elections on 20 March 2011. The next regular election of Deputies is to be held in 2014.

Prior to a 2002 territorial law which created a tenth department, the Chamber of Deputies had eighty three seats and the Senate had twenty-seven.

===Judicial branch===
The legal system is based on the Roman civil law system. Haiti accepts compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. There is a Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation), assisted by local and civil courts at a communal level.

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, is in line to succeed the President in case of death or resignation, according to the 1987 Constitution of Haiti.

==Administrative divisions==

For reasons of administration, Haiti has been divided into ten departments. Each department is divided into from three to seven arrondissements, and arrondissements are further divided into communes. The departments are listed below, with the departmental capital cities in parentheses.

# Artibonite (Gonaïves)
# Centre (Hinche)
# Grand&#x27;Anse (Jérémie)
# Nippes (Miragoâne)
# Nord (Cap-Haïtien)
# Nord-Est (Fort-Liberté)
# Nord-Ouest (Port-de-Paix)
# Ouest (Port-au-Prince)
# Sud-Est (Jacmel)
# Sud (Les Cayes)
The departments are further divided into 41 arrondissements, and 133 communes, which serve as second- and third-level administrative divisions.

<doc id="77245" wikidata="Q335039" url="?curid=77245" title="Nolan Bushnell">
<text>Nolan Kay Bushnell (born February 5, 1943) is an American businessman and electrical engineer. He established Atari, Inc. and the Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theatre chain. He has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News &quot;Innovator of the Year&quot; award, and was named one of &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s &quot;50 Men Who Changed America&quot;. He has started more than 20 companies and is one of the founding fathers of the video game industry. He is on the board of Anti-Aging Games. In 2012, he founded an educational software company called Brainrush, that is using video game technology in educational software.

He is credited with Bushnell&#x27;s Law, an aphorism about games that are &quot;easy to learn and difficult to master&quot; being rewarding.

==Personal life==
Bushnell was born in 1943 in Clearfield, Utah, in a middle-class family who were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He attended Davis High School in the nearby town of Kaysville, Utah. Bushnell enrolled at Utah State University in 1961 to study engineering and then later business. In 1964, he transferred to the University of Utah College of Engineering, where he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

He married his first wife, Paula Rochelle Nielson, in 1966 and had two daughters; in 1969, they moved to California. They divorced in 1975, just prior to Warner Communication&#x27;s purchase of Atari. Around the end of 1977, he married Nancy Nino, with whom he had six children. He also used his profit from selling Atari to Warner to purchase the former mansion of coffee magnate James Folger in Woodside, California.

Although he was a Latter-day Saint in his youth, by the time of his first divorce he had forgone the teachings often being called a &quot;lapsed Mormon&quot;. He said that he stopped practicing the faith after he got into a debate over the interpretation of the Bible with a professor at the University of Utah&#x27;s Institute of Religion while in college.

==Business career==
===Early career and Syzygy===
Bushnell worked at Lagoon Amusement Park for many years while attending college. He was made manager of the games department two seasons after starting. While working there, he became familiar with arcade electro-mechanical games, watching customers play and helping to maintain the machinery while learning how it worked, developing his understanding of how the game business operates. He was also interested in the Midway arcade games, where theme park customers would have to use skill and luck to ultimately achieve the goal and win the prize. He liked the concept of getting people curious about the game and from there getting them to pay the fee in order to play.

While in college, he worked for several employers, including Litton Guidance and Control Systems, Hadley Ltd, and the industrial engineering department at the U of U. For several summers, he built his own advertising company, Campus Company, which produced blotters for four universities and sold advertising space around a calendar of events. He also sold copies of &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot;.

After graduating, Bushnell had moved to California from Utah with the hopes of being hired by Disney, but the company was not in the routine practice of hiring fresh college graduates. Instead, Bushnell got a job as an electrical engineer with Ampex. At Ampex, he met fellow employee Ted Dabney and found they had common interests. Bushnell shared his ideas of creating pizza parlors filled with electronic games with Dabney, and took Dabney to the computing labs at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to show him &quot;Spacewar!&quot;.

In 1970, Bushnell and Dabney formed Syzygy with the intention of producing a &quot;Spacewar!&quot; clone known as &quot;Computer Space&quot;. They made an agreement with Nutting Associates, a maker of coin-op trivia and shooting games, that produced a fiberglass cabinet for the unit that included a coin-slot mechanism.

&quot;Computer Space&quot; was a commercial failure, though sales exceeded $3 million. Bushnell felt that Nutting Associates had not marketed the game well, and decided that his next game would be licensed to a bigger manufacturer. Bushnell also knew that the next game they developed would need to be simpler and not require users to read instructions on the cabinet, since their target audience would likely be drunken bar patrons.

===Atari, Inc.===
In 1972, Bushnell and Dabney set off on their own, and learned that the name &quot;Syzygy&quot; was in use; Bushnell has said at different times that it was in use by a candle company owned by a Mendocino hippie commune and by a roofing company. They instead incorporated under the name Atari, a reference to a check-like position in the game Go (which Bushnell has called his &quot;favorite game of all time&quot;).

They rented their first office on Scott Boulevard in Sunnyvale, California, contracted with Bally Manufacturing to create a video game and a pinball table, and hired their second employee, engineer Allan Alcorn. Bushnell pitched Bally on a hockey video game.

After Bushnell attended a Burlingame, California demonstration of the Magnavox Odyssey, he gave the task of making a similar product to the Magnavox table tennis game to Alcorn as a test project. He told Alcorn that he was making the game as a consumer product for General Electric, in order to motivate him. Alcorn incorporated many of his own improvements into the game design, such as the ball speeding up the longer the game went on, and &quot;Pong&quot; was born. &quot;Pong&quot; proved to be very popular; Atari released a large number of &quot;Pong&quot;-based arcade video games over the next few years as the mainstay of the company. After the release of &quot;Pong&quot;, Bushnell and Dabney had a falling-out: Dabney felt he was being pushed to the side by Bushnell, while Bushnell felt Dabney was holding back the company from larger financial success. Bushnell purchased Dabney&#x27;s share of Atari for in 1973.

To get more arcade games to market and bypass exclusivity limitations that coin-op game distributors had set, Bushnell discreetly had his neighbor Joe Keenan establish Kee Games in 1973 to manufacture near-copies of Atari&#x27;s games. Even with Kee&#x27;s output, Atari had difficulty meeting demand for arcade games, and by 1974 Atari was facing financial hardships in part due to the competition in the arcade game market. Bushnell opted to merge Kee Games into Atari in September 1974 just ahead of the release of &quot;Tank&quot;, a wholly original arcade game from Kee. &quot;Tank&quot; was an arcade success and helped bolster Atari&#x27;s finances. Keenan became president of Atari and managed its operations while Bushnell retained his CEO role.
With the company financially stable, Atari entered the consumer electronics market, with its home &quot;Pong&quot; consoles first released in 1975. Atari continued to make variants of its existing arcade games for dedicated home consoles until 1977. During this period, former Atari employees Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had approached Bushnell about investing in their home computer system, the Apple I, that was built from borrowed parts from Atari and with technical support from Atari employees. They initially offered the design to Bushnell and Atari, but Bushnell wanted Atari to focus on arcade and home consoles. Later in 1975, Jobs offered Bushnell a chance for one-third equity stake in their budding company Apple Inc., for ; Bushnell remarked in hindsight, &quot;I was so smart, I said no. It&#x27;s kind of fun to think about that, when I&#x27;m not crying.&quot; Bushnell also established the first Pizza Time Theatre in San Jose in 1977 as a means for Atari to stock its arcade games.

As Atari faced more competition in both arcade and home consoles from 1975 onward, Bushnell recognized that the costs in developing both types of systems with only limited shelf life were too high, and directed Atari&#x27;s engineers at Cyan Engineering towards a programmable home console. This console eventually was released in 1977 as the Atari Video Computer System or Atari VCS and later known as the Atari 2600. However, before Atari had completed its design, the Fairchild Channel F, the first home console to use game cartridges, was released in November 1976. Bushnell realized they needed to speed up the Atari VCS&#x27;s development. After initially considering become a public company, he instead sought a buyer. Warner Communications, looking to boost their own failing media properties, agreed to acquire Atari for , with Bushnell personally receiving , in November 1976. Warner provided a large investment into the Atari VCS to allow it to be completed early the next year and released in September 1977.

The first year of Atari VCS sales were modest and limited by Atari&#x27;s own supply. While many of initial games were arcade conversions of Atari arcade games, the second wave of games in 1983 were more abstract and difficult to promote. Warner placed Ray Kassar, a former vice president of Burlington Industries, to help with Atari&#x27;s marketing. Kassar created successful advertising and marketing throughout 1978, positioning the Atari VCS for a larger sales period at the end of the year. However, Bushnell had concerns on Kassar&#x27;s plans and feared they had produced too many units to be sold, and at a board meeting with Warner near the end of the year, reiterated this position. Bushnell recommended that funds be used in R&amp;D for developing a new, technologically superior console, as he feared rising competition would make the aging tech specs of the VCS obsolete. Bushnell&#x27;s concerns never materialized as a combination of Kassar&#x27;s marketing and the popularity of Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot; at the arcade drove Atari VCS sales. Both Warner Communications and Bushnell commonly recognized he was no longer a good leader for the company, removing him as CEO and Chairman in early 1979. Warner offered Bushnell the opportunity to stay as a director and creative consultant, but Bushnell refused. Before leaving, Bushnell negotiated the rights to Pizza Time Theatre from Atari for . Keenan replaced Bushnell but left a few months later, with Kassar being named as Atari&#x27;s CEO by mid-1979.

===Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theatre===
In 1977, while at Atari, Bushnell purchased Pizza Time Theatre back from Warner Communications. It had been created by Bushnell, originally as a place where kids could go and eat pizza and play video games, which would therefore function as a distribution channel for Atari games. Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theatre also had animatronic animals that played music as entertainment. It is known that Bushnell had always wanted to work for Walt Disney, but was continually turned down for employment when he was first starting out after graduation; Chuck E. Cheese was his homage to Disney and the technology developed there. In 1981 Bushnell turned over day-to-day food operations of Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s to a newly hired restaurant executive and focused on Catalyst Technologies.

Through 1981 and 1982, Bushnell concentrated on PTT subsidiaries Sente Technologies and Kadabrascope. Sente was a reentry into the coin-operated game business. Arcade cabinets would have a proprietary system with a cartridge slot so operators could refresh their games without having to buy whole new cabinets. Kadabrascope was an early attempt at computer assisted animation. In 1983 as the restaurants started to lose money, Sente, though profitable, was sold to Bally for $3.9 million and Kadabrascope was sold to Lucasfilm which became the beginnings of what became Pixar.

During this time Bushnell was using large loans on his Pizza Time stock to fund Catalyst. By the end of 1983, Chuck E. Cheese was having serious financial problems. President and long-time friend Joe Keenan resigned that fall. Nolan tried to step back in, blaming the money problems on over-expansion, too much tweaking of the formula and saturation in local markets by the management team. He resigned in February 1984, when the board of directors rejected his proposed changes, and Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theater (now named after its famous rat mascot) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March of 1984.

ShowBiz Pizza Place, a competing Pizza/Arcade family restaurant, then purchased Pizza Time Theatre in May 1985 and assumed its debt. The newly formed company, ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc., operated restaurants under both brands before unifying all locations under the Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza brand by 1993. Today over 560 locations of this restaurant are in business.
===Catalyst Technologies Venture Capital Group===
Bushnell founded Catalyst Technologies, one of the earliest business incubators. The Catalyst Group companies numbered in the double digits and included Androbot, Etak, Cumma, and Axlon.

Axlon launched many consumer and consumer electronic products successfully, most notably AG Bear, a bear that mumbled/echoed a child&#x27;s words back to it. In the late 1980s, Axlon managed the development of two new games for the Atari 2600, most likely as part of a marketing attempt to revive sales of the system, already more than a decade old. This included Motorodeo, a monster truck-themed games that was one of the last games developed for the Atari 2600 system, being released in 1990. The company was largely sold to Hasbro.

Etak, founded in 1984, was the first company to digitize the maps of the world, as part of the first commercial automotive navigation system; the maps ultimately provided the backbone for Google Maps, mapquest.com, and other navigation systems; it was sold to Rupert Murdoch in the 1980s. In May 2000 the company, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tele Atlas.

While many of the ideas eventually led to current-day innovations, most of Catalyst&#x27;s companies eventually failed due to a lack of underlying technology available in the 1980s to sustain these high-tech innovations. For example, Catalyst&#x27;s companies included CinemaVision, which attempted to develop high-definition television. Cumma attempted to distribute video games using special vending machines that would write the game onto discs on demand. ByVideo developed an early online shopping experience using kiosks and Laser Discs that allowed shoppers to virtually purchase products that would then be delivered later.

===PlayNet/Aristo===
After a failed bid to purchase Atari Games in 1996, the company which carried on Atari&#x27;s arcade legacy, Nolan Bushnell became senior consultant to the small game developer Aristo International after it bought Borta, Inc., where he was chairman. Aristo&#x27;s CEO and chairman was Mouli Cohen. In association with Aristo, Bushnell spearheaded TeamNet, a line of multiplayer-only arcade machines targeted towards adults, which allowed teams of up to four players to compete either locally or remotely via internet. Aristo was later renamed PlayNet. Borta Inc. Developed video games that included versions of &quot;Urban Strike&quot; and &quot;Jungle Strike&quot; along with online Sports Games. Aristo developed two main products: a touchscreen interface bar-top/arcade system that would also provide internet access, phone calls, and online networked tournaments; and a digital jukebox, capable of storing thousands of songs and downloading new releases. By late 1997 the company was facing financial troubles and was planning to withdraw the units it had released in the field and relaunch the line with improvements to the credit card swipe system and internet connections. The company died shortly before the dot-com bubble burst with its prototype machines still in development in 1997.

===uWink===

Before BrainRush, Bushnell&#x27;s most recent company was uWink, a company that evolved out of an early project called In10City (pronounced &#x27;Intensity&#x27;) which was a concept of an entertainment complex and dining experience. uWink was started by Bushnell and his business adviser Loni Reeder, who also designed the original logo for the company. The company has gone through several failed iterations including a touch-screen kiosk design, a company to run cash and prize awards as part of their uWin concept and also an online Entertainment Systems network. After nearly 7 years and over $24 million in investor funding, the touchscreen kiosks/bartop model was closed amid complaints of unpaid prizes and lack of maintaining service agreements with locations to keep the kiosk/bartop units in working condition. The latest iteration (announced in 2005) is a new interactive entertainment restaurant called the uWink Media Bistro, whose concept builds off his Chuck E. Cheese venture and previous 1988–1989 venture Bots Inc., which developed similar systems of customer-side point-of-sale touch-screen terminals in addition to autonomous pizza delivery robots for Little Caesars Pizza. The plan was for guests to order their food and drinks using screens at each table, on which they may also play games with each other and watch movie trailers and short videos. The multiplayer network type video games that allowed table to table interaction or even with table group play never materialized. Guests often spotted the OSX based machine being constantly re-booted in order to play much simpler casual video games. Another factor that possibly led to the failure of the restaurants was the placement of the restaurants. The Woodland Hills location was on the second floor of a suburban shopping mall and the Hollywood location practically hidden with minimal visibility on a higher level of a shopping center complex. The first Bistro opened in Woodland Hills, California on October 16, 2006. A second in Hollywood was established, and in 2008 the company opened a third Southern California restaurant and one in Mountain View, California. All the restaurants have since closed.

===Atari, SA===

On April 19, 2010, Atari SA, the owner of the Atari brand and its home legacy since 2001, announced that Nolan Bushnell would join the company&#x27;s board of directors. It marked his &quot;de facto&quot; return to Atari after more than 30 years.

=== Modal VR ===
Bushnell is also one of the founders of Modal VR, a company that develops a portable large-scale VR system for enterprises to train e.g., security forces.

=== Anti-Aging Games, LLC ===
Nolan is on the advisory board of Anti-AgingGames.com and was a co-founder of the company, featuring online memory, concentration, and focus games for healthy people over 35.

=== BrainRush ===

BrainRush is a company that uses video game technology in educational software where he is Founder, CEO and chairman. The company was venture capital funded in 2012. It is based on the idea that many curriculum lessons can be turned into mini-games. Developers can take any body of knowledge from English language arts to foreign language, geography, multiplication table or chemistry tables, to parts of the human body and gamify the experience. BrainRush calls their underlying technology &quot;Adaptive Practice.&quot; They have also developed an open-authoring system allowing users to quickly create games in different topic areas.

Between 2010 and 2012, BrainRush ran a test in Spanish language vocabulary learning with over 2200 teachers and 80,000 students across the country and got an increase in learning speed of between 8–10 times traditional learning. BrainRush rolled out the full platform in the fall of 2013.

=== Global Gaming Technologies Corp (CSE – GGAM.U) ===
On March 6, 2019, Nolan was appointed CEO and Chairman of publicly traded company Global Gaming Technologies Corp.

==Media appearances==
Bushnell was featured in the documentary film &quot;Something Ventured&quot; about venture capital development, as well as &quot;&quot;, which documented the unearthing of the Atari video game burial. He was also featured in animated TV show &quot;Code Monkeys&quot; in Episode 3 of Season 1. For the 50th anniversary of Atari, Bushnell was interviewed by then-current Atari CEO Wade Rosen for the &quot;Atari 50&quot; video game where he discussed his history with the company and its relevance in the modern era.

== Accolades ==
Bushnell is considered to be the &quot;father of electronic gaming&quot; due to his contributions in establishing the arcade game market and creation of Atari. There had been debate between whether Bushnell or Ralph H. Baer, who is credited with creating the first home video game console, should be considered the father of video games, which had led to some bad blood between the two inventors. However, the industry recognized that Baer should be considered the father of home video gaming, while Bushnell is credited with innovating the arcade game.

At the British Academy Video Games Awards on March 10, 2009, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded the Academy Fellowship to Bushnell in recognition of his outstanding achievement as a founding father of the video games industry.

===Planned biographical film===
Since 2008, there has been interest to a biographical film about Bushnell&#x27;s life. While Bushnell had been approached by others to make such a film and turned these offers down, he accepted an offer made by Paramount Pictures in June 2008 with a script by Craig Sherman and Brian Hecker, with Leonardo DiCaprio envisioned to star as Bushnell. While news of the film was quiet over the next ten years, in March 2018, film financing company Vision Tree was working to start an initial coin offering for cryptocurrency to raise up to for the film, which was set to be produced by DiCaprio&#x27;s studio Appian Way Productions, Vision Tree, and Avery Productions.

===GDC Pioneer Award controversy===
In January 2018, the Advisory Committee of the Game Developers Choice Awards announced that Bushnell would receive the Pioneer Award at the March ceremony at the Game Developers Conference (GDC), crediting his role at Atari. That day, several people through social media, including Brianna Wu, claimed Bushnell fostered a toxic work environment at Atari for women that became the foundation for the then-future video game industry, based on several documented interviews and accounts of Atari at the time of the 1970s and 1980s; a notable example was of Bushnell holding board meetings in a hot tub and invited female secretaries to join them. Wu and others asserted that while Bushnell had done much for the industry, recognizing him with this type of award during the ongoing #MeToo movement was sending the wrong message. Wu stated, &quot;Nolan Bushnell deserves to be honored, but this is not the right time for it. It&#x27;s easy to draw a line between the culture he created at Atari and the structural sexism women in tech face today.&quot; The hashtag &quot;#NotNolan&quot; was shared by those with similar complaints about the GDC&#x27;s choice.

The following day, the Advisory Committee reconsidered the selection of Bushnell for the award and announced the Pioneer Award would not be awarded, and instead it would be used that year to &quot;honor the pioneering and unheard voices of the past&quot;. GDC further stated that they believed their selections &quot;should reflect the values of today&#x27;s game industry&quot;. Bushnell released a statement agreeing with the committee&#x27;s decision:

In a later statement to &quot;Kotaku&quot;, Bushnell cautioned that &quot;exploring these kinds of issues through a finite, 40-year-old prism [does not offer] a productive reflection of our company&quot;, and referred to feedback from his former employees. &quot;Kotaku&quot; spoke to a dozen female former Atari employees, some whom had already spoken out on social media. All who agreed that while the company&#x27;s 1970s and 1980s workplace was influenced by the broader Sexual Revolution, the allegations made against Bushnell were exaggerated or false, and that the culture was one that they all freely participated in. Some of the more notable female employees of Atari spoke further of the situation at the company and Bushnell during the 1970s:
* Elaine Shirley, who worked at Atari during the Bushnell years, said, &quot;Those were the times. He [Nolan Bushnell] hit on women and they hit on him. If the #MeToo movement was active when Atari was alive, I think half our company would be charged. To my knowledge, no one ever did anything they did not want to do.&quot; 
* Loni Reeder, who was responsible for communications, security, and facilities at Atari and later cofounded uWink with Bushnell, stated, &quot;I was treated fairly and paid well. I have fellow Atari women friends who also know Nolan. None of us were offended by him.&quot; Reeder further stated of the workplace at Atari, &quot;I take great offense of people coming in today and saying we were oppressed...We had a united and cohesive environment. That was what the ’70s were about. It wasn&#x27;t like we all got together to have an orgy.&quot;
* Carol Kantor, the first games user researcher and who led an all-female games user research team at Atari, said, &quot;I know there are people out there who are accused and really were guilty of sexual harassment. But not Nolan. It wasn&#x27;t in his character. I certainly stand up for the Nolan that I knew. He certainly didn&#x27;t hold his power over people.&quot;
The women interviewed by &quot;Kotaku&quot; generally considered the attack and decision related to Bushnell&#x27;s award as unfair, and expressed anger at those that had raised the issue with the committee. Some stated that those who accused Bushnell of sexism did not take into consideration the culture of the time, and there was a clear and distinct difference between the sexualized occurrences at Atari in the 1970s, and the real harassment and threats faced by women in the current #MeToo movement.

The situation has led to discussion of how the Atari workplace may have influenced the current video game industry. In an editorial, Dean Takahashi suggested the current environment within the video game industry was more heavily influenced by Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, which took drastically different approaches to workplace culture.

<doc id="77248" wikidata="Q294947" url="?curid=77248" title="Duron">
<text>Duron is a line of budget x86-compatible microprocessors manufactured by AMD and released on June 19, 2000. Duron was intended to be a lower-cost offering to complement AMD&#x27;s then mainstream performance Athlon processor line, and it also competed with rival chipmaker Intel&#x27;s Pentium III and Celeron processor offerings. The Duron brand name was retired in 2004, succeeded by AMD&#x27;s Sempron line of processors as their budget offering.

==Performance==
The original Duron processors were derived from AMD&#x27;s mainstream &quot;Athlon&quot; Thunderbird processors, the primary difference being a reduction in L2 cache size to 64 KB from the Athlon&#x27;s 256 KB. This was a relatively severe reduction, making it even smaller than the 128 KB L2 available on Intel&#x27;s competing budget Celeron line. However, the originating Thunderbird architecture already featured one of the largest L1 caches at 128 KB (which was not reduced in the Duron) and also introduced AMD&#x27;s switch to an exclusive cache design which effectively unified the L1 and L2 caches. Because of this, the Duron behaved as if it had a high speed 128 KB cache combined with a somewhat slower 64 KB segment giving an effective 192 KB cache, versus the traditional inclusive cache design where the L2 cache had to store a duplicate of the data stored in the L1 cache. As a comparison the inclusive design of the Celeron effectively reduced the available size of the Level 2 cache by the size of the Level 1, which resulted in an effective size of 96 KB (128-32) in contrast to the Duron&#x27;s exclusive design (128+64=192).

Consequently, the Duron inherited the Thunderbird&#x27;s reduction in sensitivity to L2 cache size, allowing AMD to make their L2 cache higher latency and lower bandwidth to lessen processor complexity and allow better manufacturing yields without incurring a significant performance loss. The net result was that the budget Duron &quot;Spitfire&quot; CPU was roughly only 10% slower than an equivalently clocked (and significantly more expensive) Athlon &quot;Thunderbird&quot;.

==Compatibility==
The Duron line was pin-compatible and operated on the same motherboards as the Athlon line, requiring only a BIOS update in most cases. The original Duron was introduced with a 100 MHz (effectively 200 MHz) front-side bus the same as the then current Socket A Athlons. Later with the introduction of motherboard chipsets offering higher FSB speeds of 133 MHz (FSB 266) and AMD&#x27;s matching introduction of Athlon &quot;C&quot; processors supporting this speed, the Duron initially retained the 100 MHz FSB for purposes of market segmentation. Later Durons were given official support for 133 MHz bus operation only after the Athlon XP was used to introduce 166/200 MHz FSB (FSB 333/400) speeds.

==Revisions==
The original Duron, using the &quot;Spitfire&quot; core, was manufactured in 2000 and 2001 at speeds ranging from 600 to 950 MHz. It was based on the 180 nm &quot;Thunderbird&quot; Athlon core.

The second-generation Duron, the &quot;Morgan&quot; core, was sold in speed grades between 900 and 1300 MHz, and was based on the 180 nm &quot;Palomino&quot; Athlon XP core. As a result, it featured a few important enhancements, namely full Intel SSE support, enlarged TLBs, hardware data prefetch, and an integrated thermal diode. Like the &quot;Palomino&quot; core, &quot;Morgan&quot; was also expected to reduce heat dissipation; however in &quot;Morgan&quot;&#x27;s case this did not happen due to its increased core voltage.

A third-generation Duron, the &quot;Appaloosa&quot; core, was announced in the 2001-2002 AMD Processor Roadmap, to enter production in 2002; this was to be manufactured with AMD&#x27;s upcoming 130 nm process. Despite rumors of early limited circulation however, &quot;Appaloosa&quot;-based Durons never reached the market, and by the end of 2001, &quot;Appaloosa&quot; had been removed from the roadmap.

Instead of the canceled &quot;Appaloosa&quot; core, the Duron line eventually saw a final generation in 2003, in the form of the &quot;Appalbred&quot; core (later typically misspelled as &quot;Applebred&quot;), which was a 130 nm &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; Athlon XP with only 64 KiB (¼) of L2 cache enabled. The name &quot;Appalbred&quot; was a portmanteau of &quot;Appaloosa&quot; and &quot;Thoroughbred&quot;, much like the contemporary &quot;Thorton&quot; Athlon XP, a &quot;Barton&quot; with only 256 KiB (½) of L2 cache enabled, was a portmanteau of &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; and &quot;Barton&quot;. Neither &quot;Appalbred&quot; nor &quot;Thorton&quot; ever appeared on an official AMD processor roadmap.

In the years following its introduction and the withdrawal of the Duron line from the market, the spelling &quot;Appalbred&quot; gradually became replaced by the phonetically similar &quot;Applebred&quot;, as &quot;Appaloosa&quot; and the etymology of &quot;Appalbred&quot; were mostly forgotten.

==Enthusiasts==
Duron was often a favorite of computer builders looking for performance while on a tight budget. In 2003, the &quot;Appalbred&quot; Duron was available in 1.4 GHz, 1.6 GHz and 1.8 GHz grades, all on a 133 MHz (FSB 266) bus. Enthusiast groups quickly discovered these Durons to be rebadged &quot;Thoroughbred B&quot; cores with 192 KiB (¾) of L2 cache disabled and possibly defective. With a basic CPU OPGA package configuration modification, it was found that &quot;Appalbred&quot; Durons could be turned into &quot;Thoroughbred B&quot; Athlon XPs, with full 256 KiB cache, with a very high success rate. However, this was only possible for a period of approximately 4 weeks, as shortly after &quot;Appalbred&quot; was released, AMD made changes to the OPGA package that made these configuration modifications ineffective.

<text>Butler W. Lampson (born December 23, 1943) is an American computer scientist best known for his contributions to the development and implementation of distributed personal computing.

==Education and early life==
After graduating from the Lawrenceville School (where in 2009 he was awarded the Aldo Leopold Award, also known as the Lawrenceville Medal, Lawrenceville&#x27;s highest award to alumni), Lampson received an A.B. in physics (&quot;magna cum laude&quot; with highest honors in the discipline) from Harvard University in 1964 and a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967.

==Career and research==

During the 1960s, Lampson and others were part of Project GENIE at UC Berkeley. In 1965, several Project GENIE members, specifically Lampson and Peter Deutsch, developed the Berkeley Timesharing System for Scientific Data Systems&#x27; SDS 940 computer. After completing his doctorate, Lampson stayed on at UC Berkeley as an assistant professor (1967–1970) and associate professor (1970–1971) of computer science. For a period of time, he concurrently served as director of system development for the Berkeley Computer Corporation (1969–1971).

In 1971, Lampson became one of the founding members of Xerox PARC, where he worked in the Computer Science Laboratory (CSL) as a principal scientist (1971–1975) and senior research fellow (1975–1983). His now-famous vision of a personal computer was captured in the 1972 memo entitled &quot;Why Alto?&quot;. In 1973, the Xerox Alto, with its three-button mouse and full-page-sized monitor, was born.
It is now considered to be the first actual personal computer in terms of what has become the &quot;canonical&quot; GUI mode of operation.

All the subsequent computers built at Xerox PARC except for the &quot;Dolphin&quot; (used in the Xerox 1100 LISP machine) and the &quot;Dorado&quot; (used in the Xerox 1132 LISP machine) followed a general blueprint called &quot;Wildflower&quot;, written by Lampson, and this included the D-Series Machines: the &quot;Dandelion&quot; (used in the Xerox Star and Xerox 1108 LISP machine), &quot;Dandetiger&quot; (used in the Xerox 1109 LISP machine), &quot;Daybreak&quot; (Xerox 6085), and &quot;Dicentra&quot; (used internally to control various specialized hardware devices).

At PARC, Lampson helped work on many other revolutionary technologies, such as laser printer design; two-phase commit protocols; Bravo, the first WYSIWYG text formatting program; and Ethernet, the first high-speed local area network (LAN). He designed several influential programming languages such as Euclid.

Following the acrimonious resignation of Xerox PARC CSL manager Bob Taylor in 1983, Lampson and Chuck Thacker followed Taylor colleague to Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Systems Research Center. There, he was a senior consulting engineer (1984–1986), corporate consulting engineer (1986–1993) and senior corporate consulting engineer (1993–1995). Shortly before Taylor&#x27;s retirement, Lampson left to work for Microsoft Research as an architect (1995–1999), distinguished engineer (2000–2005) and technical fellow (2005–present).

Since 1987, Lampson has been an adjunct professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<doc id="77251" wikidata="Q208189" url="?curid=77251" title="Real-time strategy">
<text>Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games that does not progress incrementally in turns, but allow all players to play simultaneously, in &quot;real time.&quot; By contrast, in turn-based strategy (TBS) games, players take turns to play. The term &quot;real-time strategy&quot; was coined by Brett Sperry to market &quot;Dune II&quot; in the early 1990s.

In a real-time strategy game, each participant positions structures and maneuvers multiple units under their indirect control to secure areas of the map and destroy their opponents&#x27; assets. In a typical RTS game, it is possible to create additional units and structures generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources. These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose. More specifically, the typical game in the RTS genre features resource-gathering, base-building, in-game technological development, and indirect control of units.

The tasks a player must perform to win an RTS game can be very demanding, and complex user interfaces have evolved for them. Some features have been borrowed from desktop environments; for example, the technique of &quot;clicking and dragging&quot; to create a box that selects all units under a given area. Though some video game genres share conceptual and gameplay similarities with the RTS template, recognized genres are generally not subsumed as RTS games. For instance, city-building games, construction and management simulations, and games of real-time tactics are generally not considered real-time strategy per se. This would only apply to anything considered a god game, where the player assumes a god-like role of creation.

==History==

===Origins===
The genre recognized today as &quot;real-time strategy&quot; emerged from an extended period of evolution and refinement. Games sometimes perceived as ancestors of the real-time strategy genre were never marketed or designed as such. As a result, designating &quot;early real-time strategy&quot; titles is problematic because such games are being held up to modern standards. The genre initially evolved separately in the United Kingdom, Japan, and North America, afterward gradually merging into a unified worldwide tradition. 

Tim Barry in May 1981 described in &quot;InfoWorld&quot; a multiplayer, real-time strategy space game that ran (&quot;and probably still is&quot;) on an IBM System/370 Model 168 at a large San Francisco Bay Area company. He stated that it had &quot;far better support than many of the application programs used in the business&quot;, with a published manual and regular schedule. Comparing its complexity to &quot;Dallas&quot;, Barry recalled that &quot;when the game was restored at 5 P.M., a lot of regular work stopped&quot;.

&quot;Ars Technica&quot; traces the genre&#x27;s roots back to &quot;Utopia&quot; (1981), citing it as the &quot;birth of a genre&quot;, with a &quot;real-time element&quot; that was &quot;virtually unheard of&quot;, thus making it &quot;arguably the earliest ancestor of the real-time strategy genre&quot;. According to Ars Technica, &quot;Utopia&quot; was a turn-based strategy game with hybrid elements that ran &quot;in real-time but events happened on a regular turn-based cycle.&quot; According to Brett Weiss, &quot;Utopia&quot; is often cited as &quot;the first real-time strategy game.&quot; According to Matt Barton and Bill Loguidice, &quot;Utopia&quot; &quot;helped set the template&quot; for the genre, but has &quot;more in common with &quot;SimCity&quot; than it does with &quot;Dune II&quot; and later RTS games.&quot; Allgame listed &quot;War of Nerves&quot; (1979) as the oldest &quot;2D Real-Time Strategy&quot;. Barton also cites &quot;Cytron Masters&quot; (1982), saying it was &quot;one of the first (if not &quot;the&quot; first) real-time strategy games [sic].&quot; On the other hand, Scott Sharkey of &quot;1UP&quot; argues that, while &quot;Cytron Masters&quot; &quot;attempted real time strategy&quot;, it was &quot;much more tactical than strategic&quot; due to &quot;the inability to construct units or manage resources&quot;. &quot;Byte&quot; in December 1982 published as an Apple II type-in program &quot;Cosmic Conquest&quot;. The winner of the magazine&#x27;s annual Game Contest, the author described it as a &quot;single-player game of real-time action and strategic decision making&quot;. The magazine described it as &quot;a real-time space strategy game&quot;. The game has elements of resource management and wargaming.

In the United Kingdom, the earliest real-time strategy games are &quot;Stonkers&quot; by John Gibson, published in 1983 by Imagine Software for the ZX Spectrum, and &quot;Nether Earth&quot; for ZX Spectrum in 1987. In North America, the oldest game retrospectively classified as real-time strategy by several sources is &quot;The Ancient Art of War&quot; (1984), designed by Dave and Barry Murry of Evryware, followed by &quot;The Ancient Art of War at Sea&quot; in 1987.

In Japan, the earliest is &quot;Bokosuka Wars&quot; (1983), an early strategy RPG (or &quot;simulation RPG&quot;); the game revolves around the player leading an army across a battlefield against enemy forces in real-time while recruiting/spawning soldiers along the way, for which it is considered by Ray Barnholt of &quot;1UP&quot; to be an early prototype real-time strategy game. Another early title with real-time strategy elements is Sega&#x27;s &quot;Gain Ground&quot; (1988), a strategy-action game that involved directing a set of troops across various enemy-filled levels. TechnoSoft&#x27;s &quot;Herzog&quot; (1988) is regarded as a precursor to the real-time strategy genre, being the predecessor to &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; and somewhat similar in nature, though primitive in comparison.

&quot;IGN&quot; cites &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot;, released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1989 as &quot;arguably the first RTS game ever&quot;, and it is often cited as &quot;the first real-time strategy game&quot; according to &quot;Ars Technica&quot;. It combines traditional strategy gameplay with fully real-time, fast-paced, arcade-style action gameplay, featuring a split-screen two-player mode where both players are in action simultaneously and there are no pauses while decisions are taken, forcing players to think quickly while on the move. In &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot;, though the player only controls one unit, the manner of control foreshadowed the point-and-click mechanic of later games. Scott Sharkey of &quot;1UP&quot; argues that it introduced much of the genre conventions, including unit construction and resource management, with the control and destruction of bases being an important aspect of the game, as were the economic/production aspects of those bases. &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; is credited by &quot;1UP&quot; as a landmark that defined the genre and as &quot;the progenitor of all modern real-time strategy games.&quot; Chuck Sperry cited &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; as an influence on &quot;Dune II&quot;.

Notable as well are early games like &quot;Mega-Lo-Mania&quot; by Sensible Software (1991) and &quot;&quot; (also called &quot;Overlord&quot; – 1990). Although these two lacked direct control of military units, they both offered considerable control of resource management and economic systems. In addition, &quot;Mega Lo Mania&quot; has advanced technology trees that determine offensive and defensive prowess. Another early game, &quot;Carrier Command&quot; (1988) by Realtime Games, involved real-time responses to events in the game, requiring management of resources and control of vehicles. Another early game, &quot;SimAnt&quot; (1991) by Maxis, had resource gathering, and controlling an attacking army by having them follow a lead unit. However, it was with the release of &quot;Dune II&quot; (1992) from Westwood Studios that real-time strategy became recognized as a distinct genre of video games.

===1992–1998: Seminal titles===
Although real-time strategy games have an extensive history, some titles have served to define the popular perception of the genre and expectations of the genre more than others, in particular the games released between 1992 and 1998 by Westwood Studios and Blizzard Entertainment.

Drawing influence from &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot;, &quot;Populous&quot;, &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;, and the Macintosh user interface, Westwood&#x27;s &quot;Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty&quot; (1992) featured all the core concepts and mechanics of modern real-time strategy games that are still used today, such as using the mouse to move units, and gathering resources, and as such served as the prototype for later real-time strategy games. According to its co-designer and lead programmer, Joe Bostic, a &quot;benefit over &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; is that we had the advantage of a mouse and keyboard. This greatly facilitated precise player control, which enabled the player to give orders to individual units. The mouse, and the direct control it allowed, was critical in making the RTS genre possible.”

The success of &quot;Dune II&quot; encouraged several games that became influential in their own right.&quot; &quot; (1994) achieved great prominence upon its release, owing in part to its use of a fantasy setting and also to its depiction of a wide variety of buildings (such as farms) which approximated a full fictitious society and not just a military force. &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; (1995), as well as &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot; (1996), became the most popular early RTS games. These two games contended with &quot;Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness&quot; after its release in late 1995.

&quot;Total Annihilation&quot;, released by Cavedog Entertainment in 1997, introduced 3D units and terrain and focused on huge battles that emphasized macromanagement over micromanagement. It featured a streamlined interface that would influence many RTS games in later years. &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, released by Ensemble Studios in 1997, tried to put a game in a slower pace, combining elements of &quot;Civilization&quot; with the real-time strategy concept by introducing ages of technologies. In 1998, Blizzard released the game &quot;StarCraft&quot;, which became an international phenomenon and is still played in large professional leagues to this day. Collectively, all of these games defined the genre, providing the &quot;de facto&quot; benchmark against which new real-time strategy games are measured.

===1995–2003: Refinement and transition to 3D===
The real-time strategy genre has been relatively stable since 1995. Additions to the genre&#x27;s concept in newer games tend to emphasize more of the basic RTS elements (higher unit caps, more unit types, larger maps, etc.). Rather than innovations to the game concept, new games generally focus on refining aspects of successful predecessors. Cavedog&#x27;s &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; from 1997 introduced the first 3D units and terrain in real-time strategy games. The &quot;Age of Empires&quot; focus on historical setting and age advancement was refined further by its sequel, &quot;Age of Empires II: Age of Kings&quot;, and by Stainless Steel Studios&#x27; &quot;Empire Earth&quot; in 2001. GSC Game World&#x27;s &quot;Cossacks&quot; series brought population caps into the tens of thousands.

&quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; (1997), &quot;&quot; (1998), &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s The War of the Worlds&quot; (1998), &quot;Warzone 2100&quot; (1999), &quot;Machines&quot; (1999), &quot;Homeworld&quot; (1999), and &quot;Dark Reign 2&quot; (2000) were among the first completely 3D real-time strategy titles. &quot;Homeworld&quot; featured a 3D environment in space, therefore allowing movement in every direction, a feature which its semi-sequel, &quot;Homeworld Cataclysm&quot; (2000) continued to build upon adding features such as waypoints. &quot;Homeworld 2&quot;, released in 2003, streamlined movement in the 360° 3D environment. Furthermore, &quot;Machines&quot;, which was also released in 1999 and featured a nearly 100% 3D environment, attempted to combine the RTS genre with a first-person shooter (FPS) genre although it was not a particularly successful title. These games were followed by a short period of interest in experimental strategy games such as &quot;Allegiance&quot; (2000). &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s The War of the Worlds&quot; was notable for being one of the few completely non-linear RTS games ever.

It is only in approximately 2002 that 3D real-time strategy became the standard, with both &quot;Warcraft III&quot; (2002) and Ensemble Studio&#x27;s &quot;Age of Mythology&quot; (2002) being built on a full 3D game engine. &quot;&quot; introduced classic wargame elements, such as supply lines to the genre. &quot;Battle Realms&quot; (2001) was another full 3D game, but had limited camera views.

The move from 2D to 3D has been criticized in some cases. Issues with controlling the camera and placement of objects have been cited as problems.

===2004–2012: Specialization and evolution===
A few games have experimented with diversifying map design, which continues to be largely two-dimensional even in 3D engines. &quot;Earth 2150&quot; (2000) allowed units to tunnel underground, effectively creating a dual-layer map; three-layer (orbit-surface-underground) maps were introduced in &quot;Metal Fatigue&quot;. In addition, units could even be transported to entirely separate maps, with each map having its own window in the user interface. &quot;Three Kingdoms: Fate of the Dragon&quot; (2001) offered a simpler model: the main map contains locations that expand into their own maps. In these examples, however, the gameplay was essentially identical regardless of the map layer in question. &quot;Dragonshard&quot; (2005) emphasized its dual-layer maps by placing one of the game&#x27;s two main resources in each map, making exploration and control of both maps fundamentally valuable.

Relatively few genres have emerged from or in competition with real-time strategy games, although real-time tactics (RTT), a superficially similar genre, emerged around 1995. In 1998, Activision attempted to combine the real-time strategy and first-person shooter genres in &quot;Battlezone&quot; (1998), while in 2002 Rage Games Limited attempted this with the &quot;Hostile Waters&quot; games. Later variants have included &quot;Natural Selection&quot; (2002), a game modification based on the Half-Life engine, and the free software &quot;Tremulous&quot;/&quot;Unvanquished&quot;. &quot;&quot; (2003) combined the RPG and RTS elements in an online game.

Some games, borrowing from the real-time tactics (RTT) template, have moved toward an increased focus on tactics while downplaying traditional resource management, in which designated units collect the resources used for producing further units or buildings. Titles like &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War&quot; (2004), &quot;Star Wars: Empire at War&quot; (2006), and &quot;Company of Heroes&quot; (2006) replace the traditional resource gathering model with a strategic control-point system, in which control over strategic points yields construction/reinforcement points. &quot;Ground Control&quot; (2000) was the first such game to replace individual units with &quot;squads&quot;.

Others are moving away from the traditional real-time strategy game model with the addition of other genre elements. One example is &quot;Sins of a Solar Empire&quot; (2008), released by Ironclad Games, which mixes elements of grand-scale stellar empire building games like &quot;Master of Orion&quot; with real-time strategy elements. Another example is indie game &quot;Achron&quot; (2011), which incorporates time travel as a game mechanic, allowing a player to send units forward or backward in time.

Multiplayer online battle arena games (MOBA) have originated as a subgenre of real-time strategy games, however this fusion of real-time strategy, role-playing, and action games has lost many traditional RTS elements. These type of games moved away from constructing additional structures, base management, army building, and controlling additional units. Map and the main structures for each team are still present, and destroying enemy main structure will secure victory as the ultimate victory condition. Unlike in RTS, a player has control over the only one single powerful unit, called &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;champion&quot;, who advances in level, learns new abilities, and grows in power over the course of a match. Players can find various friendly and enemy units on the map at any given time assisting each team, however, these units are computer-controlled and players usually don&#x27;t have direct control over their movement and creation; instead, they march forward along set paths. &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot; (&quot;DotA&quot;), a &quot;Warcraft III&quot; mod from 2003, and its standalone sequel &quot;Dota 2&quot; (2013), as well as &quot;League of Legends&quot; (2009), and &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; (2015), are the typical representatives of the new strategy subgenre. Former game journalist Luke Smith called &quot;DotA&quot; &quot;the ultimate RTS&quot;.

=== 2012–present: Expansion and adaptation to various gaming formats ===
The popularization of the smartphone in the 2010s led to a new market for video games to expand to and develop. Innovation on the traditional RTS format accelerated throughout the early 2010s as RTS games were released for mobile devices. With a new format specific to mobile devices, mobile RTS games were often simpler than their desktop counterparts. The simplification of the RTS formula coupled with the adoption of the smartphone during this period allowed for mobile RTS games to be more accessible than traditional RTS games. &quot;Clash of Clans&quot; (2012), a mobile game published by Supercell, is a good example of a game which modified the RTS format into a simpler mobile experience. While often classified in the broader Strategy game genre, &quot;Clash of Clans&quot; still possesses many of the classic RTS elements, such as a &quot;perspective of god&quot;, control over buildings and mobile units, and resource management. It also introduces and simplifies specific elements of an RTS to fit the mobile format with &quot;idle&quot; resource gathering and defenses, as well as reducing the number of resource types, unit types, and building types to make the game more accessible to new users. In an interview between game journalist Bryant Francis and &quot;Clash of Clans&quot; developer Stuart McGaw, McGaw attributed &quot;Clash of Clan&quot;″s design to &quot;a focus on simplicity and accessibility&quot;, something that &quot;anyone could pick up and play&quot;, while also retaining &quot;the strategy DNA&quot;, that gives players &quot;lots of options&quot; while remaining &quot;clear to understand&quot;.  Multiple other mobile games, such as &quot;Boom Beach&quot; (2014), &quot;Plague Inc.&quot; (2012), the &quot;Bloons Tower Defense&quot; series (2007-2021), and more have (varyingly) adapted the RTS format in the same manner as &quot;Clash of Clans&quot;, and in turn developed a style of RTS unique to the mobile game industry.

Beginning in the early-mid 2010s, the expansion of the Indie game market on game developer Valve Corporation&#x27;s gaming distribution service, Steam, allowed RTS game developers to produce smaller-scale and increasingly accessible Indie-RTS games. These RTS games often are more true to the traditional RTS formula, with the player having the &quot;perspective of god&quot; and managing units and resources. Such Indie-RTS Games released in this period were often subject to Porting, and often made it to mobile devices. A few of these Indie-RTS games are &quot;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator&quot; (2017), the &quot;Machines at War&quot; series (2007-2012), and &quot;Bad North&quot; (2018).

Oftentimes, modern RTS games attempt to capture the &quot;nostalgia&quot; of classic RTS games. &quot;Rusted Warfare&quot; (2017), is an indie-mobile release which is a good example of a traditional-style RTS which utilizes assets from the unreleased &quot;Hard Vacuum&quot; (1993) to create a &quot;revived&quot; RTS experience. &quot;Hard Vacuum&quot; was intended to include &quot;resource gathering from mineral deposits&quot;, &quot;base building&quot;, and &quot;a wide range of fighting with units&quot;. &quot;Rusted Warfare&quot; and other traditional RTS titles utilized the element of classic PC-gaming nostalgia in order to drive the game-playing experience.

Traditional RTS games released in the late 2010s - early 2020s were developed with a focus on coupling the traditional-style gameplay with uniquely styled, or hyper-realistic graphics. These RTS games are often Indie-RTS games, but released on a multitude of platforms. Some RTS releases like &quot;Halo Wars 2&quot; (2017), &quot;Steel Division 2&quot; (2019), &quot;Company of Heroes 3&quot; (2023), and &quot;Last Train Home&quot; (2023) are examples of modern RTS games that are focused on providing a traditional RTS experience.

==Gameplay==
In a typical real-time strategy game, the screen is divided into a map area displaying the game world and terrain, units, and buildings, and an interface overlay containing command and production controls and often a &quot;radar&quot; or &quot;minimap&quot; overview of the entire map. The player is usually given an isometric perspective of the world, or a free-roaming camera from an aerial viewpoint for modern 3D games. Players mainly scroll the screen and issue commands with the mouse, and may also use keyboard shortcuts.

Gameplay generally consists of the player being positioned somewhere in the map with a few units or a building that is capable of building other units/buildings. Often, but not always, the player must build specific structures to unlock more advanced units in the tech tree. Often, but not always, RTS games require the player to build an army (ranging from small squads of no more than two units to literally hundreds of units) and using them to either defend themselves from a virtual form of Human wave attack or to eliminate enemies who possess bases with unit production capacities of their own. Occasionally, RTS games will have a preset number of units for the player to control and do not allow building of additional ones.

Resource gathering is commonly the main focus of the RTS games, but other titles of the genre place higher gameplay significance to how units are used in combat (&quot;&quot; for example, awards credits for territory captured rather than gathered resources), the extreme example of which are games of the real-time tactical genre. Some titles impose a ceiling on the number simultaneous troops, which becomes a key gameplay consideration, a significant example being &quot;StarCraft&quot;, while other titles have no such unit cap.

===Micromanagement and macromanagement===
Micromanagement deals with a player&#x27;s constant need to manage and maintain individual units and resources on a fine scale. On the other hand, macromanagement refers to a player&#x27;s management of economic expansion and large-scale strategic maneuvering, allowing the player time to think and consider possible solutions. Micromanagement involves the use of combat tactics involved in the present, whereas macromanagement considers the greater scale of the game in an attempt to predict the future.

===Criticism of gameplay===
====Turn-based vs. real-time====

A debate has emerged between fans of real-time strategy (RTS) and turn-based strategy (TBS) (and related genres) based on the merits of the real-time and turn-based systems. Because of their generally faster-paced nature (and in some cases a smaller learning curve), real-time strategy games have surpassed the popularity of turn-based strategy computer games. In the past, a common criticism was to regard real-time strategy games as &quot;cheap imitations&quot; of turn-based strategy games, arguing that real-time strategy games had a tendency to devolve into &quot;click-fests&quot; in which the player who was faster with the mouse generally won, because they could give orders to their units at a faster rate.

The common retort is that success involves not just fast clicking, but also the ability to make sound decisions under time pressure. The &quot;clickfest&quot; argument is also often voiced alongside a &quot;button babysitting&quot; criticism, which pointed out that a great deal of game time is spent either waiting and watching for the next time a production button could be clicked, or rapidly alternating between different units and buildings, clicking their respective button.

Some titles attempt to merge the two systems: for example, the role-playing game &quot;Fallout&quot; uses turn-based combat and real-time gameplay, while the real-time strategy games &quot;Homeworld&quot;, &quot;Rise of Nations&quot;, and the games of the &quot;Total War&quot; and &quot;Hegemony&quot; series allow the player to pause the game and issue orders. Additionally, the &quot;Total War&quot; series has a combination of a turn-based strategy map with a real-time battle map. Another example of a game combining both turn-based game and real-time-strategy is &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth II&quot; which allows players, in a &#x27;War of the Ring&#x27; game, to play a turn-based strategy game, but also battle each other in real time.

====Tactics vs. strategy====

A second criticism of the RTS genre is the importance of skill over strategy. The manual dexterity and ability to multitask and divide one&#x27;s attention is often considered the most important aspect to succeeding at the RTS genre. According to Troy Dunniway, former Westwood developer who has also worked on &quot;Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars&quot;: &quot;A player controls hundreds of units, dozens of buildings and many different events that are all happening simultaneously. There is only one player, and he can only pay attention to one thing at a time. Expert players can quickly flip between many different tasks, while casual gamers have more problems with this.&quot;

Real-time strategy games have been criticized for an overabundance of tactical considerations when compared to the amount of strategic gameplay found in such games. According to Chris Taylor, lead designer of &quot;Supreme Commander&quot;: &quot;[My first attempt at visualizing RTSs in a fresh and interesting new way] was my realizing that although we call this genre &#x27;Real-Time Strategy,&#x27; it should have been called &#x27;Real-Time Tactics&#x27; with a dash of strategy thrown in.&quot; (Taylor then posits his own game as having surpassed this mold by including additional elements of broader strategic scope.)

In general terms, military strategy refers to the use of a broad arsenal of weapons including diplomatic, informational, military, and economic resources, whereas military tactics is more concerned with short-term goals such as winning an individual battle. In the context of strategy video games, however, the difference is often reduced to the more limited criteria of either a presence or absence of base building and unit production.

In an article for &quot;Gamasutra&quot;, Nathan Toronto criticizes real-time strategy games for too often having only one valid means of victory — attrition — comparing them unfavorably to real-time tactics games. Players&#x27; awareness that the only way for them to win or lose is militarily makes them unlikely to respond to gestures of diplomacy. The result is that the winner of a real-time strategy game is too often the best tactician rather than the best strategist. Troy Goodfellow counters this by saying that the problem is not that real-time strategy games are lacking in strategy (he says attrition is a form of strategy), rather it is that they too often have the same strategy: produce faster than you consume. He also states that building and managing armies is the conventional definition of real-time strategy, and that it is unfair to make comparisons with other genres.

In an article for &quot;GameSpy&quot;, Mark Walker criticizes real-time strategy games for their lack of combat tactics, suggesting real-time tactics games as a more suitable substitute. He also says that developers need to begin looking outside the genre for new ideas in order for strategy games to continue to be successful in the future.

This criticism has ushered into a couple of hybrid designs that try to resolve the issues. The games of the &quot;Total War&quot; series have a combination of a (turn-based) strategy map with a (real-time) battle map, allowing the player to concentrate on one or the other. The games of the &quot;Hegemony&quot; series also combine a strategy map and a battle map (in full real-time) and the player can at any point in time seamlessly zoom in and out in between both.

====Rushing vs. planning====
A third common criticism is that real-time gameplay often degenerates into &quot;rushes&quot; where the players try to gain the advantage and subsequently defeat the opponent as quickly in the game as possible, preferably before the opposition is capable of successfully reacting. For example, the original &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; gave birth to the now-common &quot;tank rush&quot; tactic, where the game outcome is often decided very early on by one player gaining an initial advantage in resources and producing large amounts of a relatively powerful but still quite cheap unit—which is thrown at the opposition before they have had time to establish defenses or production. Although this strategy has been criticized for encouraging overwhelming force over strategy and tactics, defenders of the strategy argue that they&#x27;re simply taking advantage of the strategies utilized, and some argue that it is a realistic representation of warfare. One of the most infamous versions of a rush is the &quot;Zergling rush&quot; from the real-time strategy game &quot;StarCraft&quot;, where the Zerg player would morph one of their starting workers (or the first one produced) into a spawning pool immediately and use all of their resources to produce Zerglings, attacking once they have enough to overwhelm any early defense; in fact, the term &quot;zerging&quot; has become synonymous with rushing.

Some games have since introduced designs that do not easily lend themselves to rushes. For example, the &quot;Hegemony&quot; series made supply and (seasonal) resource management an integral part of its gameplay, thus limiting rapid expansion.

===On consoles===
Despite &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot;, a console game, laying the foundations for the real-time strategy genre, RTS games never gained popularity on consoles like they did on the PC platform. Real-time strategy games made for video game consoles have been consistently criticized due to their control schemes, as the PC&#x27;s keyboard and mouse are considered to be superior to a console&#x27;s gamepad for the genre. Thus, RTS games for home consoles have been met with mixed success. Scott Sharkey of &quot;1UP&quot; notes that &quot;Herzog Zwei&quot; had already &quot;offered a nearly perfect solution to the problem by giving the player direct control of a single powerful unit and near autonomy for everything else,&quot; and is surprised &quot;that more console RTS games aren&#x27;t designed with this kind of interface in mind from the ground up, rather than imitating&quot; PC control schemes &quot;that just doesn&#x27;t work very well with a controller&quot;. Some handheld consoles like &quot;Napoleon&quot; on the GBA uses a similar solution.

However, several console titles in the genre received positive reception. The &quot;Pikmin&quot; series, which began in 2001 for the GameCube, became a million-seller. Similarly, &quot;Halo Wars&quot;, which was released in 2009 for the Xbox 360, generated generally positive reviews, achieved an 82% critic average on aggregate web sites, and sold over 1 million copies.
According to &quot;IGN&quot;, the gameplay lacks the traditional RTS concepts of limited resources and resource gathering and lacks multiple buildings.

==Graphics==
&quot;Total Annihilation&quot; (1997) was the first real-time strategy game to utilize true 3D units, terrain, and physics in both rendering and in gameplay. For instance, the missiles in &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; travel in real time in simulated 3D space, and they can miss their target by passing over or under it. Similarly, missile-armed units in &quot;Earth 2150&quot; are at a serious disadvantage when the opponent is on high ground because the missiles often hit the cliffside, even in the case when the attacker is a missile-armed helicopter. &quot;Homeworld&quot;, &quot;Warzone 2100 and Machines&quot; (all released in 1999) advanced the use of fully 3D environments in real-time strategy titles. In the case of &quot;Homeworld&quot;, the game is set in space, offering a uniquely exploitable 3D environment in which all units can move vertically in addition to the horizontal plane. However, the near-industry-wide switch to full 3D was very gradual and most real-time strategy titles, including the first sequels to &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;, initially used isometric 3D graphics made by pre-rendered 3D tiles. Only in later years did these games begin to use true 3D graphics and gameplay, making it possible to rotate the view of the battlefield in real-time. &quot;Spring&quot; is a good example of the transformation from semi-3D to full-3D game simulations. It is an open-source project, which aims to give a &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; game-play experience in three dimensions. The most ambitious use of full 3D graphics was realized in &quot;Supreme Commander&quot;, where all projectiles, units and terrain were simulated in real time, taking full advantage of the UI&#x27;s zoom feature, which allowed cartographic style navigation of the 3D environment. This led to a number of unique gameplay elements, which were mostly obscured by the lack of computing power available in 2007, at the release date.

Japanese game developers Nippon Ichi and Vanillaware worked together on &quot;Grim Grimoire&quot;, a PlayStation 2 title released in 2007, which features hand-drawn animated 2D graphics.

From 2010, real-time strategy games more commonly incorporated physics engines, such as Havok, in order to increase realism experienced in gameplay. A modern real-time strategy game that uses a physics engine is Ensemble Studios&#x27; &quot;Age of Empires III&quot;, released on October 18, 2005, which used the Havok Game Dynamics SDK to power its real-time physics. &quot;Company of Heroes&quot; is another real-time strategy game that uses realistically modeled physics as a part of gameplay, including fully destructible environments.

==Tournaments==
RTS World tournaments have been held for both &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Warcraft III&quot; since their 1998 and 2002 releases. The games have been so successful that some players have earned over $200,000 at the &quot;Warcraft III World Championships&quot;. In addition, hundreds of &quot;StarCraft II&quot; tournaments are held yearly, as it is becoming an increasingly popular branch of e-sports. Notable tournaments include MLG, GSL, and Dreamhack. RTS tournaments are especially popular in South Korea.

<text>The Xerox Alto is a computer system developed at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) in the 1970s. It is considered one of the first workstations or personal computers, and its development pioneered many aspects of modern computing. It features a graphical user interface (GUI), a mouse, Ethernet networking, and the ability to run multiple applications simultaneously. It is one of the first computers to use a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) text editor and has a bit-mapped display. The Alto did not succeed commercially, but it had a significant influence on the development of future computer systems.

The Alto was designed for an operating system based on a GUI, later using the desktop metaphor. The first machines were introduced on March 1, 1973, and in limited production starting one decade before Xerox&#x27;s designs inspired Apple to release the first mass-market GUI computers. The Alto is contained in a relatively small cabinet and uses a custom central processing unit (CPU) built from multiple SSI and MSI integrated circuits. Each machine cost tens of thousands of dollars. Few were built initially, but by the late 1970s, about 1,000 were in use at various Xerox laboratories, and about another 500 in several universities. Total production was about 2,000 systems.

The Alto became well known in Silicon Valley and its GUI was increasingly seen as the future of computing. In 1979, Steve Jobs arranged a visit to Xerox PARC, during which Apple Computer personnel received demonstrations of Xerox technology in exchange for Xerox being able to purchase stock options in Apple. After two visits to see the Alto, Apple engineers used the concepts in developing the Lisa and Macintosh systems.

In 1981, Xerox commercialized a line of office computers, the Star, based on concepts from the Alto. A complete office system including several workstations, storage, and a laser printer cost up to . Like the Alto, the Star had little direct impact on the market.

==History==
The Alto is the first computer with a graphical operating system, and was built on earlier graphical interface designs. It was conceived in 1972 in a memo written by Butler Lampson, inspired by the oN-Line System (NLS) developed by Douglas Engelbart and Dustin Lindberg at SRI International (SRI). Of further influence was the PLATO education system developed at the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois. The Alto was designed mostly by Charles P. Thacker. Industrial Design and manufacturing was sub-contracted to Xerox&#x27;s Special Programs Group in El Segundo, whose team included program manager Doug Stewart, operations manager Abbey Silverstone, and industrial designer Bob Nishimura. An initial run of 30 units was produced by the Special Programs Group, working with John Ellenby at PARC and Stewart and Silverstone at El Segundo, who were responsible for re-designing the Alto&#x27;s electronics. Due to the success of the pilot run, the team went on to produce approximately 2,000 units over the next ten years.

Several Xerox Alto chassis are on display at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, one is on display at the Computer Museum of America in Roswell, Georgia, and several are in private hands. Running systems are on display at the System Source Computer Museum in Hunt Valley, Maryland. Charles P. Thacker was awarded the 2009 Turing Award of the Association for Computing Machinery on March 9, 2010, for his pioneering design and realization of the Alto. The 2004 Charles Stark Draper Prize was awarded to Thacker, Alan C. Kay, Butler Lampson, and Robert W. Taylor for their work on Alto.

On October 21, 2014, Xerox Alto&#x27;s source code and other resources were released from the Computer History Museum.

==Architecture==
The following description is based mostly on the August 1976 Alto Hardware Manual by Xerox PARC.

Alto uses a microcoded design, but unlike many computers, the microcode engine is not hidden from the programmer in a layered design. Applications such as Pinball take advantage of this to accelerate performance. The Alto has a bit-slice arithmetic logic unit (ALU) based on the Texas Instruments 74181 chip, a ROM control store with a writable control store extension and has 128 (expandable to 512) KB of main memory organized in 16-bit words. Mass storage is provided by a hard disk drive that uses a removable 2.5 MB one-platter cartridge (Diablo Systems, a company Xerox later bought) similar to those used by the IBM 2310. The base machine and one disk drive are housed in a cabinet about the size of a small refrigerator; one more disk drive can be added via daisy-chaining.

Alto both blurs and ignores the distinction between functional elements. Rather than a distinct central processing unit with a well-defined electrical interface (such as a system bus) to storage and peripherals, the Alto ALU interacts directly with hardware interfaces to memory and peripherals, driven by microinstructions that are output from the control store. The microcode machine supports up to 16 cooperative multitasking tasks, each with fixed priority. The emulator task executes the normal instruction set to which most applications are written; that instruction set is similar to a Data General Nova. Other tasks serve the display, memory refresh, disk, network, and other I/O functions. For example, the bitmap display controller is little more than a 16-bit shift register; microcode moves display refresh data from main memory to the shift register, which serializes it into a display of pixels corresponding to the ones and zeros of the memory data. Ethernet is likewise supported by minimal hardware, with a shift register that acts bidirectionally to serialize output words and deserialize input words. Its speed was designed to be 3 Mbit/s because the microcode engine can not go faster and continue to support the video display, disk activity, and memory refresh.

Unlike most minicomputers of the era, Alto does not support a serial terminal for user interface. Apart from an Ethernet connection, the Alto&#x27;s only common output device is a bi-level (black and white) cathode-ray tube (CRT) display with a tilt-and-swivel base, mounted in portrait orientation rather than the more common &quot;landscape&quot; orientation. Its input devices are a custom detachable keyboard, a three-button mouse, and an optional 5-key chorded keyboard (chord keyset). The last two items had been introduced by SRI&#x27;s On-Line System and the mouse was an instant success among Alto users, but the chord keyset never became popular.

In the early mice, the buttons are three narrow bars, arranged top to bottom rather than side to side; they were named after their colors in the documentation. The motion is sensed by two perpendicular wheels. These were soon replaced with a ball-type mouse, which was invented by Ronald E. Rider and developed by Bill English. These are photo-mechanical mice, first using white light, and then infrared (IR), to count the rotations of wheels inside the mouse.

Each key on the Alto keyboard is represented as a separate bit in a set of memory locations. As a result, it is possible to read multiple key presses concurrently. This trait can be used to alter from where on the disk the Alto boots. The keyboard value is used as the sector address on the disk to boot from, and by holding specific keys down while pressing the boot button, different microcode and operating systems can be loaded. This gave rise to the expression &quot;nose boot&quot; where the keys needed to boot for a test OS release requires more fingers than the user can articulate. Nose boots were obsoleted by the codice_1 program that shifts files on the disk so that a specified key sequence can be used.

Several other I/O devices were developed for the Alto, including a television camera, the Hy-Type daisywheel printer and a parallel port, although these were quite rare. The Alto could also control external disk drives to act as a file server. This was a common application for the machine.

==Software==

Early software for the Alto was written in the programming language BCPL, and later in Mesa, which was not widely used outside PARC but influenced several later languages, such as Modula. The Alto used an early version of ASCII which lacked the underscore character, instead having the left-arrow character used in ALGOL 60 and many derivatives for the assignment operator: this peculiarity may have been the source of the CamelCase style for compound identifiers. Altos were also microcode-programmable by users.

The Alto helped popularize the use of raster graphics model for all output, including text and graphics. It also introduced the concept of the &quot;bit block transfer&quot; operation (bit blit, BitBLT), as the fundamental programming interface to the display. Despite its small memory size, many innovative programs were written for the Alto, including:
* the first WYSIWYG typesetting document preparation systems, Bravo and Gypsy;
* the Laurel email tool, and its successor, Hardy
* the Sil vector graphics editor, used mainly for logic circuits, printed circuit board, and other technical diagrams;
* the Markup bitmap editor (an early paint program);
* the Draw graphical editor using lines and splines;
* the first WYSIWYG integrated circuit editor, ICARUS, based on the work of Lynn Conway, Carver Mead, and the Mead and Conway revolution;
* the first versions of the Smalltalk environment
* Interlisp
* one of the first network-based multi-person video games (&quot;Alto Trek&quot; by Gene Ball).
There was no spreadsheet or database software. The first electronic spreadsheet program, VisiCalc, did not appear until 1979.

==Diffusion and evolution==
Technically, the Alto is a small minicomputer, but it could be considered a personal computer in the sense that it is used by one person sitting at a desk, in contrast with the mainframe computers and other minicomputers of the era. It is arguably &quot;the first personal computer&quot;, although this title is disputed. More significantly (and perhaps less controversially), it may be considered to be one of the first workstation systems, with successors such as the Apollo workstations and systems by Symbolics (designed to natively run Lisp as a development environment).

In 1976 to 1977, the Swiss computer pioneer Niklaus Wirth spent a sabbatical at PARC and was excited by the Alto. Unable to bring back an Alto system to Europe, Wirth decided to build a new system from scratch and he designed with his group the Lilith. It was ready to use around 1980, before Apple released Lisa in 1981 and Macintosh in 1984. Around 1985, Wirth started a complete redesign of the Lilith under the Name &quot;Project Oberon&quot;.

In 1978, Xerox donated 50 Altos to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Rochester. The National Bureau of Standards&#x27;s Institute for Computer Sciences in Gaithersburg, Maryland received one Alto in late 1978 along with Xerox Interim File System (IFS) file servers and Dover laser printers. These machines inspired the ETH Zuerich Lilith and Three Rivers Company PERQ workstations, and the Stanford University Network (SUN) workstation, which launched a spin-off company, Sun Microsystems. The Apollo/Domain workstation was heavily influenced by the Alto.

Following the acquisition of an Alto, the White House information systems department sought to lead federal computer suppliers in its direction. The Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP) issued a request for proposal for a computer system to replace the aging Office of Management and Budget (OMB) budget system, using Alto-like workstations, connected to an IBM-compatible mainframe. The request was eventually withdrawn because no mainframe producer could supply such a configuration.

In December 1979, Apple Computer&#x27;s co-founder Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC, where he was shown the Smalltalk-76 object-oriented programming environment, networking, and most importantly the WYSIWYG, mouse-driven graphical user interface provided by the Alto. At the time, he didn&#x27;t recognize the significance of the first two, but was excited by the last one. The GUI was promptly integrating into Apple&#x27;s products, first into the Lisa and then in the Macintosh, and Jobs recruited several key researchers from PARC.

In 1980-1981, Altos were used by engineers at PARC and at the Xerox System Development Department to design the Star workstations.

==Xerox and the Alto==
Xerox was slow to realize the value of the technology that had been developed at PARC. The Xerox corporate acquisition of Scientific Data Systems (SDS, later XDS) in the late 1960s had no interest to PARC. PARC built their own emulation of the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 named the MAXC. The MAXC was PARC&#x27;s gateway machine to the ARPANET. The firm was reluctant to get into the computer business again with commercially untested designs, although many of the philosophies would ship in later products.

&quot;Byte&quot; magazine stated in 1981,

After the Alto, PARC developed more powerful workstations (none intended as projects) informally termed &quot;the D-machines&quot;: Dandelion (least powerful, but the only to be made a product in one form), Dolphin; Dorado (most powerful; an emitter-coupled logic (ECL) machine); and hybrids like the Dandel-Iris.

Before the advent of personal computers such as the Apple II in 1977 and the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in 1981, the computer market was dominated by costly mainframes and minicomputers equipped with dumb terminals that time-shared the processing time of the central computer. Through the 1970s, Xerox showed no interest in PARC&#x27;s work. When Xerox finally entered the PC market with the Xerox 820, it pointedly rejected the Alto design and opted instead for a very conventional model, a CP/M-based machine with the then-standard 80 by 24 character-only monitor and no mouse.

With the help of PARC researchers, Xerox eventually developed the Star, based on the Dandelion workstation, and later the cost-reduced Star, the 6085 office system, based on the Daybreak workstation. These machines, based on the Wildflower architecture described in a paper by Butler Lampson, incorporated most of the Alto innovations, including the graphical user interface with icons, windows, folders, Ethernet-based local networking, and network-based laser printer services.

Xerox only realized its mistake in the early 1980s, after the Macintosh revolutionized the PC market via its bitmap display and the mouse-centered interface. Both of these were inspired by the Alto. The Xerox Star series was a relative commercial success, but it came too late. The expensive Xerox workstations could not compete against the cheaper GUI-based workstations that arose in the wake of the first Macintosh, and Xerox eventually quit the workstation market.
