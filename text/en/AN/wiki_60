<text>Dame June Rosemary Whitfield (11 November 1925 – 29 December 2018) was an English radio, television and film actress.

Whitfield&#x27;s big break was a lead in the radio comedy &quot;Take It from Here&quot;, which aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1953. Television roles soon followed, including appearances with Tony Hancock throughout his television career. In 1966, Whitfield played the leading role in the television sitcom &quot;Beggar My Neighbour&quot;, which ran for three series. She also appeared in four &quot;Carry On&quot; films: &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot; (1959), &quot;Carry On Abroad&quot; (1972), &quot;Carry On Girls&quot; (1973) and &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot; (1992).

In 1968, Whitfield and Terry Scott began a long television partnership, which peaked with roles as husband and wife in &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; (1974–1979) and &quot;Terry and June&quot; (1979–1987). From 1992 to 2016, Whitfield played Edina Monsoon&#x27;s mother in Jennifer Saunders&#x27; &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. She played a regular character in &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; (2005–2010) and a recurring character in &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot; (2007–2009).

From 1993 to 2001, Whitfield played Miss Marple in the radio dramatisation of all twelve of Agatha Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple novels on BBC Radio 4.

==Early life==
June Rosemary Whitfield was born at 44 Mount Ephraim Lane in Streatham, London, in 1925, to John Herbert Whitfield and his wife Bertha Georgina née Flett. Her father was the managing director of a company called Dictograph Telephones that had been founded by his father in Yorkshire, and both of her parents were keen amateur actors. She made her first stage appearance, aged three, after her mother enrolled her at Robinson&#x27;s Dance Studio. Whitfield attended Streatham Hill High School, before being evacuated during the Second World War to Bognor Regis, where she attended St Michael&#x27;s School, and then to Penzance in Cornwall. She moved with her parents to Huddersfield, where she learned shorthand and typing. She continued to study secretarial skills at Pitman&#x27;s College, Brixton Hill. In 1944, Whitfield graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art with a diploma.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
Whitfield began her career in the 1940s working with Wilfred Pickles, and worked on stage in the West End and the regions.

In 1951, she had her first credited television role in &quot;The Passing Show&quot; and joined the London cast of the musical &quot;South Pacific&quot;.

Her big break came in 1953 when she replaced Joy Nichols in the successful Frank Muir and Denis Norden radio comedy &quot;Take It from Here&quot;, co-starring Jimmy Edwards and Dick Bentley. In the portion of the show known as &quot;The Glums&quot; she played Eth, fiancée of the dim Ron Glum (played by Bentley). During the next fifteen years Whitfield had many supporting roles on television, including in &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Treasured Volumes&quot;, &quot;The Arthur Askey Show&quot;, &quot;Faces of Jim&quot;, &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; and &quot;Frankie Howerd&quot;. She played the nurse in the opening scene of &quot;The Blood Donor&quot; (&quot;Hancock&quot;, 1961). June&#x27;s daughter Suzy Aitchison would play the same role in the 2009 re-recording with Paul Merton portraying Tony Hancock.

In 1959, she appeared in &quot;Carry On Nurse&quot;, the first of her four appearances in the &quot;Carry On&quot; film series.

=== 1960s to 1980s ===
Whitfield gained her first starring role in the sitcom &quot;Beggar My Neighbour&quot; (1966), playing Rose Garvey. The year after &quot;Beggar My Neighbour&quot; finished in 1968, she appeared on &quot;Scott On...&quot; for six years until 1974. This started a working relationship with Terry Scott that lasted until 1987. During &quot;Scott On...&quot; she also appeared in &quot;The Best Things in Life&quot;, &quot;The Goodies&quot;, &quot;The Dick Emery Show&quot;, &quot;Bless This House&quot; and &quot;The Pallisers&quot;. She appeared in the spin-off film of &quot;Bless This House&quot; (1972), with Scott as her husband, and &quot;Carry On Abroad&quot; (also 1972), followed by an appearance in &quot;Carry On Girls&quot; (1973).

Whitfield starred alongside Scott in a &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; sitcom pilot called &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; (1974). A few months later the first full series was broadcast, with a further four series until 1979. Later that year, they appeared together in the first series of &quot;Terry and June&quot;. The two sitcoms were very similar, the only main differences being a change of surname (from Fletcher to Medford), and a different house and family. Both had Scott and Whitfield as a suburban middle-class married couple. &quot;Terry and June&quot; ran for 65 episodes until 1987. Five years later, in 1992, Julian Clary created &quot;Terry and Julian&quot;, a Channel 4 sitcom which spoofed the title of &quot;Terry and June&quot;; Whitfield made an appearance in one episode. During the eight-year run of &quot;Terry and June&quot;, Whitfield also appeared in &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; and &quot;Minder&quot;.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, Whitfield appeared in a series of television advertisements, created for Birds Eye by advertising art director Vernon Howe, and featuring the concluding voice-over line: &quot;it can make a dishonest woman of you!&quot;

In 1971, Whitfield and Frankie Howerd recorded a novelty comic version of the song &quot;Je t&#x27;aime&quot;, previously recorded by Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg, in which she featured as &quot;Mavis&quot;.

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions: in April 1976, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at her home in Wimbledon; and in March 1995, when Michael Aspel surprised her at BBC Television Centre.

During the 1980s, Whitfield returned to radio comedy. From 1984, she could be heard with Roy Hudd on the satire programme &quot;The News Huddlines&quot;, which finished in 2001. On it she often used impersonations and was known for her impression of the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. During the 1980s and 1990s, she made several stage appearances, including in a revival of &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; and the pantomime &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;. In 1985, she sang a duet with Ian Charleson of the Irving Berlin song &quot;You&#x27;re Just in Love&quot; in &quot;A Royal Night of One Hundred Stars&quot;.

=== 1990s to 2010s ===
Having appeared in an episode of &quot;French and Saunders&quot; in 1988, Whitfield played Mother in Jennifer Saunders&#x27; sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; from 1992 until 2012. In 2000, she featured with the rest of the &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; cast in the pilot &quot;Mirrorball&quot;. From 1993 to 2001, she played Miss Marple in 12 radio adaptations of Agatha Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple books. From 1990, she appeared in films including &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot; (1992), &quot;Jude&quot; (1996) and &quot;Faeries&quot; (1999, as the voice of Mrs Coombs). In 1998, Whitfield played the housekeeper in the London-set episode of &quot;Friends&quot; &quot;The One with Ross&#x27;s Wedding, Part Two&quot; and voiced a character in an episode of the animated comedy series &quot;Rex the Runt&quot;.

Her autobiography &quot;And June Whitfield&quot;, written with the help of Christopher Douglas, appeared in 2000. She appeared in &quot;The Royal&quot;, followed by appearances in &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot;, &quot;New Tricks&quot; and &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, which she joined in 2005. She had an episode of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; devoted to her on 29 July 2007 and, in the same year, appeared in the English National Opera&#x27;s production of &quot;On the Town&quot; in London&#x27;s West End. In November 2007, she appeared in the &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; spin-off &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot; as the mother of Marlene, and in 2008 she appeared in an episode of ITV medical drama &quot;Harley Street&quot;. In 2009, she made a guest appearance in &quot;Kingdom&quot; and published an updated autobiography, &quot;At a Glance ... An Absolutely Fabulous Life&quot;, a collection of scrapbook pictures from her life and career.

Whitfield appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; two-part episode, &quot;The End of Time&quot;, that aired over Christmas 2009New Year 2010. On 29 December 2009, she was the subject of an entire evening&#x27;s tribute programming on BBC Two.

Her character, May, appeared at the funeral of Blanche Hunt and explained to Blanche&#x27;s daughter, Deirdre, how her mother had died. In 2011, she played Margaret Rutherford in the BBC Radio 4 play &quot;A Monstrous Vitality&quot;, a radio adaption by Andy Merriman of his biography of Rutherford, &quot;A Dreadnought with Good Manners&quot;. She reprised her role of Mother in two episodes of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; at Christmas 2011New Year 2012, and for an Olympic special on 23 July 2012. In 2013, Whitfield became the inaugural recipient of the Aardman Slapstick Comedy Legend Award, a recognition of her lifetime&#x27;s contribution to the world of comedy. In 2014, she made a second appearance in &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, and appeared in &quot;Jonathan Creek.&quot; From 2014 to 2016 she appeared in the sitcom &quot;Boomers&quot; as the mother of Stephanie Beacham&#x27;s character. In 2015, she played Granny Wallon in a BBC One adaptation of Laurie Lee&#x27;s novel &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot;.

Despite her success, Whitfield never wanted a lead role, stating that she lacked the drive and confidence. She attributed the premature deaths of several comedians to &quot;the responsibility, the stress and strain&quot; of carrying their shows.

In December 2017, Whitfield said that she was living in a care home.

<doc id="80732" wikidata="Q372713" url="?curid=80732" title="Pacemaker">
<text>A pacemaker, also known as an artificial cardiac pacemaker, is an implanted medical device that generates electrical pulses delivered by electrodes to one or more of the chambers of the heart. Each pulse causes the targeted chamber(s) to contract and pump blood, thus regulating the function of the electrical conduction system of the heart.

The primary purpose of a pacemaker is to maintain an even heart rate, either because the heart&#x27;s natural cardiac pacemaker provides an inadequate or irregular heartbeat, or because there is a block in the heart&#x27;s electrical conduction system. Modern pacemakers are externally programmable and allow a cardiologist to select the optimal pacing modes for individual patients. Most pacemakers are on demand, in which the stimulation of the heart is based on the dynamic demand of the circulatory system. Others send out a fixed rate of impulses.

A specific type of pacemaker, called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, combines pacemaker and defibrillator functions in a single implantable device. Others, called biventricular pacemakers, have multiple electrodes stimulating different positions within the ventricles (the lower heart chambers) to improve their synchronization.
== Methods of pacing ==

=== Percussive pacing ===
Percussive pacing, also known as transthoracic mechanical pacing, is the use of the closed fist, usually on the left lower edge of the sternum over the right ventricle in the &quot;vena cava&quot;, striking from a distance of 20 – 30 cm to induce a ventricular beat (the &quot;British Journal of Anaesthesia&quot; suggests this must be done to raise the ventricular pressure to 10–15 mmHg to induce electrical activity). This is an old procedure used only as a life-saving means until an electrical pacemaker is brought to the patient.

=== Transcutaneous pacing ===

Transcutaneous pacing (TCP), also called external pacing, is recommended for the initial stabilization of hemodynamically significant bradycardias of all types. The procedure is performed by placing two pacing pads on the patient&#x27;s chest, either in the anterior/lateral position or the anterior/posterior position. The rescuer selects the pacing rate, and gradually increases the pacing current (measured in mA) until electrical capture (characterized by a wide QRS complex with a tall, broad T wave on the ECG) is achieved, with a corresponding pulse. Pacing artifact on the ECG and severe muscle twitching may make this determination difficult. External pacing should not be relied upon for an extended period of time. It is an emergency procedure that acts as a bridge until transvenous pacing or other therapies can be applied.

=== Epicardial pacing ===

Temporary epicardial pacing is used during open heart surgery should the surgical procedure create atrio-ventricular block. The electrodes are placed in contact with the outer wall of the ventricle (epicardium) to maintain satisfactory cardiac output until a temporary transvenous electrode has been inserted.

Permanent epicardial pacing leads can be implanted surgically and tunneled to the pulse generator pocket. These leads are either passively touching the heart and sewn in place, or have a screw mechanism to actively fix to the heart.

=== Transvenous pacing (temporary) ===

Transvenous pacing, when used for temporary pacing, is an alternative to transcutaneous pacing. A pacemaker wire is placed into a vein, under sterile conditions, and then passed into either the right atrium or right ventricle. The pacing wire is then connected to an external pacemaker outside the body. Transvenous pacing is often used as a bridge to permanent pacemaker placement. It can be kept in place until a permanent pacemaker is implanted or until there is no longer a need for a pacemaker and then it is removed.

=== Permanent transvenous pacing ===
Permanent pacing with an implantable pacemaker involves transvenous placement of one or more pacing electrodes within a chamber, or chambers, of the heart, while the pacemaker is implanted under the skin below the clavicle. The procedure is performed by incision of a suitable vein into which the electrode lead is inserted and passed along the vein, through the valve of the heart, until positioned in the chamber. The procedure is facilitated by fluoroscopy which enables the physician to view the passage of the electrode lead. After satisfactory lodgement of the electrode is confirmed, the opposite end of the electrode lead is connected to the pacemaker generator.

There are three basic types of permanent pacemakers, classified according to the number of chambers involved and their basic operating mechanism:
* &quot;Single-chamber pacemaker&quot;. In this type, only one pacing lead is placed into a chamber of the heart, either the atrium or the ventricle.
* &quot;Dual-chamber pacemaker&quot;. Here, wires are placed in two chambers of the heart. One lead paces the atrium and one paces the ventricle. This type more closely resembles the natural pacing of the heart by assisting the heart in coordinating the function between the atria and ventricles.
*&quot;Biventricular pacemaker&quot;. This pacemaker has three wires placed in three chambers of the heart. One in the atrium and two in either ventricle. It is more complicated to implant.
* &quot;Rate-responsive pacemaker&quot;. This pacemaker has sensors that detect changes in the patient&#x27;s physical activity and automatically adjust the pacing rate to fulfill the body&#x27;s metabolic needs.

The pacemaker generator is a hermetically sealed device containing a power source, usually a lithium battery, a sensing amplifier which processes the electrical manifestation of naturally occurring heart beats as sensed by the heart electrodes, the computer logic for the pacemaker and the output circuitry which delivers the pacing impulse to the electrodes.

Most commonly, the generator is placed below the subcutaneous fat of the chest wall, above the muscles and bones of the chest. However, the placement may vary on a case-by-case basis.

The outer casing of pacemakers is so designed that it will rarely be rejected by the body&#x27;s immune system. It is usually made of titanium, which is inert in the body.

=== Leadless pacing ===
Leadless pacemakers are devices that are as small as a capsule and are small enough to allow the generator to be placed within the heart, therefore avoiding the need for pacing leads. As pacemaker leads can fail over time, a pacing system that avoids these components offers theoretical advantages. Leadless pacemakers can be implanted into the heart using a steerable catheter fed into the femoral vein via an incision in the groin.

== Basic function ==


=== Pacing modes ===
Modern pacemakers usually have multiple functions. The most basic form monitors the heart&#x27;s native electrical rhythm. When the pacemaker wire or &quot;lead&quot; does not detect heart electrical activity in the chamber – atrium or ventricle – within a normal beat-to-beat time period – most commonly one second – it will stimulate either the atrium or the ventricle with a short low voltage pulse. If it does sense electrical activity, it will hold off stimulating. This sensing and stimulating activity continues on a beat by beat basis and is called &quot;demand pacing&quot;. In the case of a dual-chamber device, when the upper chambers have a spontaneous or stimulated activation, the device starts a countdown to ensure that in an acceptable – and programmable – interval, there is an activation of the ventricle, otherwise again an impulse will be delivered.

The more complex forms include the ability to sense and/or stimulate both the atrial and ventricular chambers.

From this the basic ventricular &quot;on demand&quot; pacing mode is VVI or with automatic rate adjustment for exercise VVIR – this mode is suitable when no synchronization with the atrial beat is required, as in atrial fibrillation. The equivalent atrial pacing mode is AAI or AAIR which is the mode of choice when atrioventricular conduction is intact but the sinoatrial node of the natural pacemaker is unreliable – sinus node disease (SND) or sick sinus syndrome. Where the problem is atrioventricular block (AVB) the pacemaker is required to detect (sense) the atrial beat and after a normal delay (0.1–0.2 seconds) trigger a ventricular beat, unless it has already happened – this is VDD mode and can be achieved with a single pacing lead with electrodes in the right atrium (to sense) and ventricle (to sense and pace). These modes AAIR and VDD are unusual in the US but widely used in Latin America and Europe. The DDDR mode is most commonly used as it covers all the options though the pacemakers require separate atrial and ventricular leads and are more complex, requiring careful programming of their functions for optimal results.

Automatic pacemakers are designed to be over-ridden by the heart&#x27;s natural rate at any moment that it gets back to a non-pathologic normal sinus rhythm and can reinitiate influencing the electric activity in the heart when the pathologic event happens again. A &quot;ventricular-demand pacemaker&quot; produces a narrow vertical spike on the ECG, just before a wide QRS. The spike of an &quot;atrial-demand pacemaker&quot; appears just before the P wave.

Comparably, a Triggered Pacemaker is activated immediately after an electrical activity is commenced in the heart tissue by itself. A &quot;ventricular triggered pacemaker&quot; produces the impulse just after a pulse is created in the ventricular tissue and it appears as a simultaneous spike with QRS. An &quot;atrial triggered pacemaker&quot; is the mode in which an impulse is produced immediately after an electrical event in the atrium. It appears as a discharge following the p wave but prior to the QRS which is commonly widened.

=== Threshold ===
The heart is composed of an excitable tissue and an electrical pulse of a certain voltage is needed to &quot;capture&quot; the myocardium to make the heart function. The minimum voltage to achieve this is called the threshold. As this is a probabilistic property, the actual voltage used is higher than the threshold (usually by a 50-100% margin). Additionally, the electrical pulse has a time component and proper description of a threshold is a voltage and pulse width.

All electrical circuits require a complete connection between the cathode and the anode. For some pacing leads, both connections to the heart are provided in a single lead (&quot;bipolar&quot;) and some only provide a single connection (&quot;unipolar&quot;). In unipolar, the second connection is internally from the heart to the generator through the body (blood, tissue, etc).

Also important is the impedance. The lower the impedance, the more current is needed to achieve the threshold voltage and lowers the battery life. The impedance is affected by the integrity of the pacing lead and the electrode-tissue interface of the lead with the heart.

=== Sensing and sensitivity ===
In important aspect of pacemaker function is sensing the intrinsic heart activity. This is called sensing. Larger sensed voltages are desired and it is expected that the ventricle produces larger voltages than the atria.

The minimum voltage to sense an event is called the sensitivity. The higher the sensitivity, the less that is sensed, and vice-versa. Too low of a sensitivity can cause troubles with sensing P waves, T waves, and noise; sensing these things is called &quot;over sensing&quot;. A sensitivity too high may result in missed sensing of P waves in the atria and QRS in the ventricles, and is called &quot;under sensing.&quot;

== Biventricular pacing ==

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is used for people with heart failure in whom the left and right ventricles do not contract simultaneously (ventricular dyssynchrony), which occurs in approximately 25–50% of heart failure patients. To achieve CRT, a biventricular pacemaker (BVP) is used, which can pace both the septal and lateral walls of the left ventricle. By pacing both sides of the left ventricle, the pacemaker can resynchronize the ventricular contractions.

CRT devices have at least two leads, one passing through the &quot;vena cava&quot; and the right atrium into the right ventricle to stimulate the septum, and another passing through the &quot;vena cava&quot; and the right atrium and inserted through the coronary sinus to pace the epicardial wall of the left ventricle. Often, for patients in normal sinus rhythm, there is also a lead in the right atrium to facilitate synchrony with the atrial contraction. Thus, the timing between the atrial and ventricular contractions, as well as between the septal and lateral walls of the left ventricle can be adjusted to achieve optimal cardiac function.

CRT devices have been shown to reduce mortality and improve quality of life in patients with heart failure symptoms; a LV ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% and QRS duration on EKG of 120 ms or greater.

Biventricular pacing alone is referred to as CRT-P (for pacing). For selected patients at risk of arrhythmias, CRT can be combined with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD): such devices, known as CRT-D (for defibrillation), also provide effective protection against life-threatening arrhythmias.

== Conduction System Pacing ==
Conventional placement of ventricular leads in or around the tip or &quot;apex&quot; of the right ventricle, or RV apical pacing, can have negative effects on heart function. It has been associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, weakening of the heart muscle and potentially shorter life expectancy. His bundle pacing (HBP) and left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) leads to a more natural or perfectly natural ventricular activation and has generated strong research and clinical interest. By stimulating the His–Purkinje fiber network directly with a special lead and placement technique, HBP causes a synchronized and therefore more effective ventricular activation and avoids long-term heart muscle disease. HBP in some cases can also correct bundle branch block patterns.

== Advancements in function ==

A major step forward in pacemaker function has been to attempt to mimic nature by utilizing various inputs to produce a rate-responsive pacemaker using parameters such as the QT interval, pO2 – pCO2 (dissolved oxygen or carbon dioxide levels) in the arterial-venous system, physical activity as determined by an accelerometer, body temperature, ATP levels, adrenaline, etc.
Instead of producing a static, predetermined heart rate, or intermittent control, such a pacemaker, a &#x27;Dynamic Pacemaker&#x27;, could compensate for both actual respiratory loading and potentially anticipated respiratory loading. The first dynamic pacemaker was invented by Anthony Rickards of the National Heart Hospital, London, UK, in 1982.

Dynamic pacemaking technology could also be applied to future artificial hearts. Advances in transitional tissue welding would support this and other artificial organ/joint/tissue replacement efforts. Stem cells may be of interest in transitional tissue welding.

Many advancements have been made to improve the control of the pacemaker once implanted. Many of these have been made possible by the transition to microprocessor controlled pacemakers. Pacemakers that control not only the ventricles but the atria as well have become common. Pacemakers that control both the atria and ventricles are called dual-chamber pacemakers. Although these dual-chamber models are usually more expensive, timing the contractions of the atria to precede that of the ventricles improves the pumping efficiency of the heart and can be useful in congestive heart failure.

Rate responsive pacing allows the device to sense the physical activity of the patient and respond appropriately by increasing or decreasing the base pacing rate via rate response algorithms.

The DAVID trials have shown that unnecessary pacing of the right ventricle can exacerbate heart failure and increases the incidence of atrial fibrillation. The newer dual-chamber devices can keep the amount of right ventricle pacing to a minimum and thus prevent worsening of the heart disease.

== Considerations ==

=== Insertion ===
A pacemaker may be implanted whilst a person is awake using local anesthetic to numb the skin with or without sedation, or asleep using a general anesthetic. An antibiotic is usually given to reduce the risk of infection. Pacemakers are generally implanted in the front of the chest in the region of the left or right shoulder. The skin is prepared by clipping or shaving any hair over the implant site before cleaning the skin with a disinfectant such as chlorhexidine. An incision is made below the collar bone and a space or pocket is created under the skin to house the pacemaker generator. This pocket is usually created just above the pectoralis major muscle (prepectoral), but in some cases the device may be inserted beneath the muscle (submuscular). The lead or leads are fed into the heart through a large vein guided by X-ray imaging (fluoroscopy). The tips of the leads may be positioned within the right ventricle, the right atrium, or the coronary sinus, depending on the type of pacemaker required. Surgery is typically completed within 30 to 90 minutes. Following implantation, the surgical wound should be kept clean and dry until it has healed. Some movements of the shoulder within a few weeks of insertion carry a risk of dislodging the pacemaker leads.

The batteries within a pacemaker generator typically last 5 to 10 years. When the batteries are nearing the end of life, the generator is replaced in a procedure that is usually simpler than a new implant. Replacement involves making an incision to remove the existing device, disconnecting the leads from the old device and reconnecting them to a new generator, reinserting the new device and closing the skin.

==== Periodic pacemaker checkups ====

Once the pacemaker is implanted, it is periodically checked to ensure the device is operational and performing appropriately; the device can be checked as often as is deemed necessary. Routine pacemaker checks are typically done in-office every six months, though will vary depending upon patient/device status and remote monitoring availability. Newer pacemaker models can also be interrogated remotely, with the patient transmitting their pacemaker data using a transmitter at home connected to a cellular telephone network.

During in-office follow-up, diagnostic tests may include:
* Sensing: the ability of the device to &quot;see&quot; intrinsic cardiac activity (atrial and ventricular depolarization).
* Impedance: A test to measure lead integrity. Large and/or sudden increases in impedance can indicate a lead fracture, while large and/or sudden decreases in impedance can be caused by insulation failure.
* Threshold amplitude: The minimum voltage (generally in hundredths of volts) required in order to pace the atrium or ventricle connected to the lead.
* Threshold duration: The time that the device requires at the preset amplitude to reliably pace the atrium or ventricle connected to the lead.
* Percentage of pacing: The percentage of time that the pacemaker has been actively pacing since the previous device interrogation, which shows how dependent the patient is on the device.
* Estimated battery life at current rate: As modern pacemakers are &quot;on-demand&quot; and only pace when necessary, battery lifespan is affected by how much the pacemaker is utilized. Other factors affecting battery life include programmed output and algorithms (features) that use battery power.
* Any events that were stored since the last follow-up, in particular arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. These are typically stored based on specific criteria set by the physician and specific to the patient. Some devices have the availability to display intracardiac electrograms showing the onset of an event as well as the event itself, which helps to diagnose its cause or origin.

=== Magnetic fields, MRIs, and other lifestyle issues ===
A patient&#x27;s lifestyle is usually not modified to any great degree after the insertion of a pacemaker. There are a few activities that are unwise, such as full-contact sports and exposure of the pacemaker to intense magnetic fields.

The pacemaker patient may find that some types of everyday actions need to be modified. For instance, the shoulder harness of a vehicle seatbelt may be uncomfortable if it falls across the pacemaker insertion site. Women will not be able to wear bras for a while after the operation, and later might have to wear bras with wide shoulder straps.

For some sports and physical activities, special pacemaker protection can be worn to prevent possible injuries, or damage to the pacemaker leads.

Pacemakers may be affected by magnetic or electromagnetic fields, and ionising and acoustic radiation. However, a 2013 study found that &quot;The overall risk of clinically significant adverse events related to EMI (electromagnetic interference) in recipients of CIEDs (cardiovascular implantable electronic devices) is very low. Therefore, no special precautions are needed when household appliances are used. Environmental and industrial sources of EMI are relatively safe when the exposure time is limited and distance from the CIEDs is maximized. The risk of EMI-induced events is highest within the hospital environment.&quot; The study lists and tabulates many sources of interference, and many different potential effects: damage to circuitry, asynchronous pacing, etc. Some sources of hazard in older devices have been eliminated in newer ones.

Activities involving strong magnetic fields should be avoided. This includes activities such as arc welding with certain types of equipment, and maintaining heavy equipment that may generate strong magnetic fields. Some medical procedures, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), involve very strong magnetic fields or other conditions that may damage pacemakers.

However, many modern pacemakers are specified to be MR conditional or MRI conditional, safe to use during MRI subject to certain conditions. The first to be so specified was the Medtronic Revo MRI SureScan, approved by the US FDA in February 2011, which was the first to be specified as MR conditional. There are several conditions to use of MR Conditional pacemakers, including certain patients&#x27; qualifications and scan settings. An MRI conditional device has to have MRI settings enabled before a scan, and disabled afterwards.

 the five most commonly used cardiac pacing device manufacturers (covering more than 99% of the US market) made FDA-approved MR-conditional pacemakers. The use of MRI may be ruled out by the patient having an older, non-MRI Conditional pacemaker, or by having old pacing wires inside the heart, no longer connected to a pacemaker.

A 2008 US study found that the magnetic field created by some headphones used with portable music players or cellphones may cause interference if placed very close to some pacemakers.

In addition, according to the American Heart Association, some home devices have the potential to occasionally inhibit a single beat. Cellphones do not seem to damage pulse generators or affect how the pacemaker works. It is recommended that objects containing magnets, or generating a significant magnetic field, should not be in close proximity to a pacemaker. Induction cooktops, in particular, can pose a risk.

Before medical procedures, the patient should inform all medical personnel that they have a pacemaker. Having a pacemaker does not imply that a patient requires the use of antibiotics to be administered before procedures such as dental work.

=== End-of-life care and pacemaker deactivation ===
A panel of the Heart Rhythm Society, a US specialist organization based in Washington, DC, deemed that it was legal and ethical to honor requests by patients, or by those with legal authority to make decisions for patients, to deactivate implanted cardiac devices. Lawyers say that the legal situation is similar to removing a feeding tube, though there was no legal precedent involving pacemakers in the United States. A patient in many jurisdictions (including the US) is deemed to have a right to refuse or discontinue treatment, including a pacemaker that keeps them alive. Physicians have a right to refuse to turn it off, but are advised by the HRS panel that they should refer the patient to a physician who will. Some patients consider that hopeless, debilitating conditions, such as severe strokes or late-stage dementia, can cause so much suffering that they would prefer not to prolong their lives with supportive measures.

=== Privacy and security ===
Security and privacy concerns have been raised with pacemakers that allow wireless communication. Unauthorized third parties may be able to read patient records contained in the pacemaker, or reprogram the devices, as has been demonstrated by a team of researchers. The demonstration worked at short range; they did not attempt to develop a long range antenna. The proof of concept exploit helps demonstrate the need for better security and patient alerting measures in remotely accessible medical implants. In response to this threat, Purdue University and Princeton University researchers have developed a prototype firewall device, called MedMon, which is designed to protect wireless medical devices such as pacemakers and insulin pumps from attackers.

=== Complications ===

Complications from having surgery to implant a pacemaker are uncommon (each 1-3% approximately), but could include: infection where the pacemaker is implanted or in the bloodstream; allergic reaction to the dye or anesthesia used during the procedure; swelling, bruising or bleeding at the generator site, or around the heart, especially if the patient is taking blood thinners, elderly, of thin frame or otherwise on chronic steroid use.

A possible complication of dual-chamber artificial pacemakers is &#x27;pacemaker-mediated tachycardia&#x27; (PMT), a form of reentrant tachycardia. In PMT, the artificial pacemaker forms the anterograde (atrium to ventricle) limb of the circuit and the atrioventricular (AV) node forms the retrograde limb (ventricle to atrium) of the circuit. Treatment of PMT typically involves reprogramming the pacemaker.

Another possible complication is &quot;pacemaker-tracked tachycardia,&quot; where a supraventricular tachycardia such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is tracked by the pacemaker and produces beats from a ventricular lead. This is becoming exceedingly rare as newer devices are often programmed to recognize supraventricular tachycardias and switch to non-tracking modes.

It is important to consider leads as a potential nidus for thromboembolic events. The leads are small-diameter wires from the pacemaker to the implantation site in the heart muscle, and are usually placed intravenously through the subclavian vein in order to access the right atrium. Placing a foreign object within the venous system in such a manner may disrupt blood-flow and allow for thrombus formation. Therefore, patients with pacemakers may need to be placed on anti-coagulation therapy to avoid potential life-threatening thrombosis or embolus.

These leads may also damage the tricuspid valve leaflets, either during placement or through wear and tear over time. This can lead to tricuspid regurgitation and right-sided heart failure, which may require tricuspid valve replacement.

Sometimes leads will need to be removed. The most common reason for lead removal is infection; however, over time, leads can degrade due to a number of reasons such as lead flexing. Changes to the programming of the pacemaker may overcome lead degradation to some extent. However, a patient who has several pacemaker replacements over a decade or two in which the leads were reused may require lead replacement surgery.

Lead replacement may be done in one of two ways. Insert a new set of leads without removing the current leads (not recommended as it provides additional obstruction to blood flow and heart valve function) or remove the current leads and then insert replacements. The lead removal technique will vary depending on the surgeon&#x27;s estimation of the probability that simple traction will suffice to more complex procedures. Leads can normally be disconnected from the pacemaker easily, which is why device replacement usually entails simple surgery to access the device and replace it by simply unhooking the leads from the device to replace and hooking the leads to the new device. The possible complications, such as perforation of the heart wall, come from removing the lead{s} from the patient&#x27;s body.

The free end of a pacemaker lead is actually implanted into the heart muscle with a miniature screw or anchored with small plastic hooks called tines. The longer the leads have been implanted (starting from a year or two), the more likely that they will have additional attachments to the patient&#x27;s body at various places in the pathway from device to heart muscle, since the body tends to incorporate foreign devices into tissue. In some cases, for a lead that has been inserted for a short amount of time, removal may involve simple traction to pull the lead from the body. Removal in other cases is typically done with a laser or cutting device which threads like a cannula with a cutting edge over the lead and is moved down the lead to remove any organic attachments with tiny cutting lasers or similar device.

Pacemaker lead malposition in various locations has been described in the literature. Treatment varies, depending on the location of the pacer lead and symptoms.

Another possible complication called twiddler&#x27;s syndrome occurs when a patient manipulates the pacemaker and causes the leads to be removed from their intended location and causes possible stimulation of other nerves.

Overall life expectancy with pacemakers is excellent, and mostly depends upon underlying diseases, presence of atrial fibrillation, age and sex at the time of first implantation.

== Other devices ==
Sometimes devices resembling pacemakers, called implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are implanted. These devices are often used in the treatment of patients at risk from sudden cardiac death. An ICD has the ability to treat many types of heart rhythm disturbances by means of pacing, cardioversion, or defibrillation. Some ICD devices can distinguish between ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia (VT), and may try to pace the heart faster than its intrinsic rate in the case of VT, to try to break the tachycardia before it progresses to ventricular fibrillation. This is known as &quot;fast-pacing&quot;, &quot;overdrive pacing&quot;, or &quot;anti-tachycardia pacing&quot; (ATP). ATP is only effective if the underlying rhythm is ventricular tachycardia, and is never effective if the rhythm is ventricular fibrillation.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
In 1889, John Alexander MacWilliam reported in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; (BMJ) of his experiments in which application of an electrical impulse to the human heart in asystole caused a ventricular contraction and that a heart rhythm of 60–70 beats per minute could be evoked by impulses applied at spacings equal to 60–70/minute.

In 1926, Mark C Lidwill of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital of Sydney, supported by physicist Edgar H. Booth of the University of Sydney, devised a portable apparatus which &quot;plugged into a lighting point&quot; and in which &quot;One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution&quot; while the other pole &quot;consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber&quot;. &quot;The pacemaker rate was variable from about 80 to 120 pulses per minute, and likewise the voltage variable from 1.5 to 120 volts&quot;. In 1928, the apparatus was used to revive a stillborn infant at Crown Street Women&#x27;s Hospital in Sydney, whose heart continued &quot;to beat on its own accord&quot;, &quot;at the end of 10 minutes&quot; of stimulation.

In 1932, American physiologist Albert Hyman, with the help of his brother, described an electro-mechanical instrument of his own, powered by a spring-wound hand-cranked motor. Hyman himself referred to his invention as an &quot;artificial pacemaker&quot;, the term continuing in use to this day.

An apparent in the publication of research conducted between the early 1930s and World War II may be attributed to the public perception of interfering with nature by &quot;reviving the dead&quot;. For example, &quot;Hyman did not publish data on the use of his pacemaker in humans because of adverse publicity, both among his fellow physicians, and due to newspaper reporting at the time. Lidwell may have been aware of this and did not proceed with his experiments in humans&quot;.

=== Transcutaneous ===
In 1950, Canadian electrical engineer John Hopps designed and built the first external pacemaker based upon observations by cardio-thoracic surgeons Wilfred Gordon Bigelow and John Callaghan at Toronto General Hospital. The device was first tested on a dog at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Banting Institute. A substantial external device using vacuum tube technology to provide transcutaneous pacing, it was somewhat crude and painful to the patient in use and, being powered from an AC wall socket, carried a potential hazard of electrocution of the patient and inducing ventricular fibrillation.

A number of innovators, including Paul Zoll, made smaller but still bulky transcutaneous pacing devices from 1952 using a large rechargeable battery as the power supply.

In 1957, William L. Weirich published the results of research performed at the University of Minnesota. These studies demonstrated the restoration of heart rate, cardiac output and mean aortic pressures in animal subjects with complete heart block through the use of a myocardial electrode.

In 1958 Colombian doctor Alberto Vejarano Laverde and Colombian electrical engineer Jorge Reynolds Pombo constructed an external pacemaker, similar to those of Hopps and Zoll, weighing 45 kg and powered by a 12 volt car lead–acid battery, but connected to electrodes attached to the heart. This apparatus was successfully used to sustain a 70-year-old priest, Gerardo Florez.

The development of the silicon transistor and its first commercial availability in 1956 was the pivotal event that led to the rapid development of practical cardiac pacemaking.

=== Wearable ===
In 1958, engineer Earl Bakken of Minneapolis, Minnesota, produced the first wearable external pacemaker for a patient of C. Walton Lillehei. This transistorized pacemaker, housed in a small plastic box, had controls to permit adjustment of pacing heart rate and output voltage and was connected to electrode leads which passed through the skin of the patient to terminate in electrodes attached to the surface of the myocardium of the heart.

In the UK in the 1960s, Lucas Engineering in Birmingham was asked by Mr Abrams of The Queen Elizabeth Hospital to produce a prototype for a transistorised replacement for the electro-mechanical product. The team was headed by Roger Nolan, an engineer with the Lucas Group Research Centre. Nolan designed and created the first blocking oscillator and transistor-powered pacemaker. This pacemaker was worn on a belt and powered by a rechargeable sealed battery, enabling users to live a more-normal life.

One of the earliest patients to receive this Lucas pacemaker device was a woman in her early 30s. The operation was carried out in 1964 by South African cardiac surgeon Alf Gunning, a student of Christiaan Barnard. This pioneering operation took place under the guidance of cardiac consultant Peter Sleight at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford and his cardiac research team at St George&#x27;s Hospital in London.

=== Implantable ===

The first clinical implantation into a human of a fully implantable pacemaker was on October 8, 1958, at the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden, using a pacemaker designed by inventor Rune Elmqvist and surgeon Åke Senning (in collaboration with Elema-Schönander AB, later Siemens-Elema AB), connected to electrodes attached to the myocardium of the heart by thoracotomy. The device failed after three hours. A second device was then implanted which lasted for two days. The world&#x27;s first implantable pacemaker patient, Arne Larsson, went on to receive 26 different pacemakers during his lifetime. He died in 2001, at the age of 86, outliving the inventor and the surgeon.

In 1959, temporary transvenous pacing was first demonstrated by Seymour Furman and John Schwedel, whereby the catheter electrode was inserted via the patient&#x27;s basilic vein.

In February 1960, an improved version of the Swedish Elmqvist design was implanted by Doctors Orestes Fiandra and Roberto Rubio in the Casmu 1 Hospital of Montevideo, Uruguay. This pacemaker, the first implanted in the Americas, lasted until the patient died of other ailments, nine months later. The early Swedish-designed devices used batteries recharged by an induction coil from the outside.

Implantable pacemakers constructed by engineer Wilson Greatbatch entered use in humans from April 1960 following extensive animal testing. The Greatbatch innovation varied from the earlier Swedish devices in using primary cells (a mercury battery) as the energy source. The first patient lived for a further 18 months.

The first use of transvenous pacing in conjunction with an implanted pacemaker was by Parsonnet in the United States, Lagergren in Sweden and Jean-Jacques Welti in France in 1962–63.
The transvenous, or pervenous, procedure involved incision of a vein into which was inserted the catheter electrode lead under fluoroscopic guidance, until it was lodged within the trabeculae of the right ventricle. This became the method of choice by the mid-1960s.

Cardiothoracic surgeon Leon Abrams and medical engineer Ray Lightwood developed and implanted the first patient-controlled variable-rate heart pacemaker in 1960 at the University of Birmingham. The first implant took place in March 1960, with two further implants the following month. These three patients made good recoveries and returned to a high quality of life. By 1966, 56 patients had undergone implantation with one surviving for over years.

=== Lithium battery ===

The preceding implantable devices all suffered from the unreliability and short lifetime of the available primary cell technology, mainly the mercury battery. In the late 1960s, several companies, including ARCO in the US, developed isotope-powered pacemakers, but this development was overtaken by the development in 1971 of the lithium iodide cell by Wilson Greatbatch. Lithium-iodide or lithium anode cells became the standard for pacemaker designs.

A further impediment to the reliability of the early devices was the diffusion of water vapor from body fluids through the epoxy resin encapsulation, affecting the electronic circuitry. This phenomenon was overcome by encasing the pacemaker generator in a hermetically sealed metal case, initially by Telectronics of Australia in 1969, followed by Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. of St. Paul, Minnesota in 1972. This technology, using titanium as the encasing metal, became the standard by the mid-1970s.

On July 9, 1974, Manuel A. Villafaña and Anthony Adducci, the founders of Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. (Guidant), manufactured the world&#x27;s first pacemaker with a lithium anode and a lithium-iodide electrolyte solid-state battery. Lithium-iodide or lithium anode cells increased the life of pacemakers from one year to as long as eleven years, and has become the standard for pacemaker designs. They began designing and testing their implantable cardiac pacemaker powered by a new longer-life lithium battery in 1971. The first patient to receive a CPI pacemaker emerged from surgery in June 1973.

Liza Morton was fitted with an implantable pacemaker at 11 days old in 1978, at Glasgow’s Yorkhill hospital, Scotland. She was the youngest baby at the time 

=== Intra-cardial ===
In 2013, several firms announced devices that could be inserted via a leg catheter rather than invasive surgery. The devices are roughly the size and shape of a pill, much smaller than the size of a traditional pacemaker. Once implanted, the device&#x27;s prongs contact the muscle and stabilize heartbeats. Development of this type of device was continuing. In November 2014, Bill Pike of Fairbanks, Alaska, received a Medtronic Micra pacemaker in Providence St Vincent Hospital in Portland, Oregon. D. Randolph Jones was the EP doctor. Also in 2014, St. Jude Medical Inc. announced the first enrollments in the company&#x27;s leadless Pacemaker Observational Study evaluating the Nanostim leadless pacing technology. The Nanostim pacemaker received European CE marking in 2013. Post-approval implant trials were carried out in Europe. The European study was stopped after reports of six perforations that led to two patient deaths. After investigations, St Jude Medical restarted the study. In the United States, this therapy had not been approved by the FDA . While the St Jude Nanostim and the Medtronic Micra are single-chamber pacemakers, it was anticipated that leadless dual-chamber pacing for patients with atrioventricular block would become possible with further development.

=== Reusable pacemakers ===

Worldwide each year, in a simple procedure to avoid explosions, thousands of pacemakers are removed from bodies to be cremated. Pacemakers with significant remaining battery life are potentially life-saving devices for people in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The Institute of Medicine, a US non-governmental organization, has reported that inadequate access to advanced cardiovascular technologies is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in LMICs. Ever since the 1970s, multiple studies worldwide have reported on the safety and efficacy of pacemaker reuse. , widely acceptable standards for safe pacemaker and ICD reuse had not been developed, and there continued to be legal and regulatory barriers to widespread adoption of medical device reuse.

<text>In computer architecture, 32-bit computing refers to computer systems with a processor, memory, and other major system components that operate on data in 32-bit units. Compared to smaller bit widths, 32-bit computers can perform large calculations more efficiently and process more data per clock cycle. Typical 32-bit personal computers also have a 32-bit address bus, permitting up to 4 GB of RAM to be accessed, far more than previous generations of system architecture allowed.

32-bit designs have been used since the earliest days of electronic computing, in experimental systems and then in large mainframe and minicomputer systems. The first hybrid 16/32-bit microprocessor, the Motorola 68000, was introduced in the late 1970s and used in systems such as the original Apple Macintosh. Fully 32-bit microprocessors such as the HP FOCUS, Motorola 68020 and Intel 80386 were launched in the early to mid 1980s and became dominant by the early 1990s. This generation of personal computers coincided with and enabled the first mass-adoption of the World Wide Web. While 32-bit architectures are still widely-used in specific applications, the PC and server market has moved on to 64 bits with x86-64 and other 64-bit architectures since the mid-2000s with installed memory often exceeding the 32-bit 4G RAM address limits on entry level computers. The latest generation of smartphones have also switched to 64 bits.

==Range for storing integers==
A 32-bit register can store 232 different values. The range of integer values that can be stored in 32 bits depends on the integer representation used. With the two most common representations, the range is 0 through 4,294,967,295 (232 − 1) for representation as an (unsigned) binary number, and −2,147,483,648 (−231) through 2,147,483,647 (231 − 1) for representation as two&#x27;s complement.

One important consequence is that a processor with 32-bit memory addresses can directly access at most 4 GiB of byte-addressable memory (though in practice the limit may be lower).

==Technical history==
The world&#x27;s first stored-program electronic computer, the Manchester Baby, used a 32-bit architecture in 1948, although it was only a proof of concept and had little practical capacity. It held only 32 32-bit words of RAM on a Williams tube, and had no addition operation, only subtraction.

Memory, as well as other digital circuits and wiring, was expensive during the first decades of 32-bit architectures (the 1960s to the 1980s). Older 32-bit processor families (or simpler, cheaper variants thereof) could therefore have many compromises and limitations in order to cut costs. This could be a 16-bit ALU, for instance, or external (or internal) buses narrower than 32 bits, limiting memory size or demanding more cycles for instruction fetch, execution or write back.

Despite this, such processors could be labeled &quot;32-bit&quot;, since they still had 32-bit registers and instructions able to manipulate 32-bit quantities. For example, the IBM System/360 Model 30 had an 8-bit ALU, 8-bit internal data paths, and an 8-bit path to memory, and the original Motorola 68000 had a 16-bit data ALU and a 16-bit external data bus, but had 32-bit registers and a 32-bit oriented instruction set. The 68000 design was sometimes referred to as &quot;16/32-bit&quot;.

However, the opposite is often true for newer 32-bit designs. For example, the Pentium Pro processor is a 32-bit machine, with 32-bit registers and instructions that manipulate 32-bit quantities, but the external address bus is 36 bits wide, giving a larger address space than 4 GB, and the external data bus is 64 bits wide, primarily in order to permit a more efficient prefetch of instructions and data.

==Architectures==
Prominent 32-bit instruction set architectures used in general-purpose computing include the IBM System/360, IBM System/370 (which had 24-bit addressing), System/370-XA, ESA/370, and ESA/390 (which had 31-bit addressing), the DEC VAX, the NS320xx, the Motorola 68000 family (the first two models of which had 24-bit addressing), the Intel IA-32 32-bit version of the x86 architecture, and the 32-bit versions of the ARM, SPARC, MIPS, PowerPC and PA-RISC architectures. 32-bit instruction set architectures used for embedded computing include the 68000 family and ColdFire, x86, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, and Infineon TriCore architectures.

== Applications==
On the x86 architecture, a 32-bit application normally means software that typically (not necessarily) uses the 32-bit linear address space (or flat memory model) possible with the 80386 and later chips. In this context, the term came about because DOS, Microsoft Windows and OS/2 were originally written for the 8088/8086 or 80286, 16-bit microprocessors with a segmented address space where programs had to switch between segments to reach more than 64 kilobytes of code or data. As this is quite time-consuming in comparison to other machine operations, the performance may suffer. Furthermore, programming with segments tend to become complicated; special &quot;far&quot; and &quot;near&quot; keywords or &quot;memory models&quot; had to be used (with care), not only in assembly language but also in high level languages such as Pascal, compiled BASIC, Fortran, C, etc.

The 80386 and its successors fully support the 16-bit segments of the 80286 but also segments for 32-bit address offsets (using the new 32-bit width of the main registers). If the base address of all 32-bit segments is set to 0, and segment registers are not used explicitly, the segmentation can be forgotten and the processor appears as having a simple linear 32-bit address space. Operating systems like Windows or OS/2 provide the possibility to run 16-bit (segmented) programs as well as 32-bit programs. The former possibility exists for backward compatibility and the latter is usually meant to be used for new software development.

==Images==
In digital images/pictures, 32-bit usually refers to RGBA color space; that is, 24-bit truecolor images with an additional 8-bit alpha channel. Other image formats also specify 32 bits per pixel, such as RGBE.

In digital images, 32-bit sometimes refers to high-dynamic-range imaging (HDR) formats that use 32 bits per channel, a total of 96 bits per pixel. 32-bit-per-channel images are used to represent values brighter than what sRGB color space allows (brighter than white); these values can then be used to more accurately retain bright highlights when either lowering the exposure of the image or when it is seen through a dark filter or dull reflection.

For example, a reflection in an oil slick is only a fraction of that seen in a mirror surface. HDR imagery allows for the reflection of highlights that can still be seen as bright white areas, instead of dull grey shapes.

==File formats==
A 32-bit file format is a binary file format for which each elementary information is defined on 32 bits (or 4 bytes). An example of such a format is the Enhanced Metafile Format.

<text>American University (AU or American) is a private federally chartered research university in Washington, D.C., United States. Its main campus spans 90 acres (36 ha) on Ward Circle, mostly in the Spring Valley neighborhood of Northwest D.C. 

American University was chartered by an Act of Congress in 1893 at the urging of Methodist bishop John Fletcher Hurst, who sought to create an institution that would promote public service, internationalism, and pragmatic idealism. AU broke ground in 1902, opened as a graduate education institution in 1914, and admitted its first undergraduates in 1925. Although affiliated with the United Methodist Church, religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission.

American University has eight schools and colleges: the School of International Service, College of Arts and Sciences, Kogod School of Business, School of Communication, Professional Studies and Executive Education, School of Public Affairs, School of Education, and the Washington College of Law (WCL). It has over 160 programs, including 71 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 87 master&#x27;s degrees, and 10 doctoral degrees, as well as JD, LLM, and SJD programs. AU&#x27;s student body numbers over 13,000 and represents all 50 U.S. states and 141 countries; around a fifth of students are international. American University is among the top three feeder schools to the Department of State. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

The university owns National Public Radio&#x27;s flagship capital affiliate, WAMU, which has been a source of nationally and internationally distributed programming such as &quot;The Diane Rehm Show&quot; and &quot;1A&quot;.

==History==
===Founding===
American University was established in the District of Columbia by an Act of Congress on December 5, 1892, primarily due to the efforts of Methodist bishop John Fletcher Hurst, who aimed to create an institution that could train future public servants. Hurst also chose the university&#x27;s site, which was in the rural periphery of Washington, D.C.

After more than three decades devoted principally to securing financial support, the university was officially dedicated on May 15, 1914. Instruction began in October 1914 with 28 student enrollees, 19 of whom were graduates and the remainder special students not candidates for a degree.

===20th century===
American University&#x27;s first commencement was held on June 2, 1915, though no degrees were awarded. Its second commencement was held the following year and saw the awarding of American University&#x27;s first degrees: one master&#x27;s degree and two doctorates. At this time, the university admitted both women and African Americans, something uncommon for institutions of higher education. Among its first 28 students were five women. An African American doctoral student was admitted in 1915.
Shortly after these early commencement ceremonies, classes were interrupted by war. During World War I, the university allowed the U.S. military to use the university&#x27;s grounds for testing. In 1917, the U.S. military divided American University into two segments, Camp American University and Camp Leach. Camp American University became the birthplace of the United States&#x27; chemical weapons program and the site of chemical weapons testing; this required a major cleanup effort in the 1990s. Camp Leach was home to advanced research, development, and testing of modern camouflage techniques. , the Army Corps of Engineers was still removing munitions debris.

Instruction was first offered only at the graduate level, in accordance with the vision of the university&#x27;s founders. This changed in 1925 with the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts (subsequently named the College of Arts and Sciences), which offered undergraduate degrees and programs. What is now the School of Public Affairs was founded in 1934, partly to educate future federal employees in public administration. During an event commemorating its launch, President Franklin D. Roosevelt stressed cooperation between the school and his administration.

AU&#x27;s relationship with the U.S. government continued during World War II, when the campus hosted the U.S. Navy Bomb Disposal School and a WAVE barracks. For AU&#x27;s role in these wartime efforts, the Victory ship SS &quot;American Victory&quot; was named in its honor.
The post-World War II period saw considerable growth and restructuring of AU. In 1947, the Washington Semester Program was established, pioneering the concept of 
semester-long internships in the nation&#x27;s capital. In 1949, the university merged with the Washington College of Law, which began in 1896 as the first law school founded by women and the first coeducational institution for the professional study of law in the District. Shortly after that, three departments were reorganized as schools: the School of Business Administration in 1955 (subsequently named the Robert P. and Arlene R. Kogod College of Business Administration and in 1999, renamed the Kogod School of Business); the School of Government and Public Administration in 1957; and the School of International Service in 1958.

In the early 1960s, the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency operated the FFRDC Special Operations Research Office as a think tank at American University. AU&#x27;s political involvement was furthered by President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Spring 1963 commencement address. In the speech, Kennedy called on the Soviet Union to work with the United States to achieve a nuclear test ban treaty and to reduce the considerable international tensions and the specter of nuclear war during that juncture of the Cold War.

From 1965 to 1977, the College of Continuing Education existed as a degree-granting college responsible for on- and off-campus adult education programs. The Lucy Webb Hayes School of Nursing provided an undergraduate study in Nursing from 1965 until 1988. In 1972, the School of Government and Public Administration, the School of International Service, the Center for Technology and Administration, and the Center for the Administration of Justice (subsequently named the School of Justice) were incorporated into the College of Public and International Affairs.

The university bought the Immaculata Campus in 1986 to alleviate space problems. This would later become Tenley Campus.

In 1986, construction on the Adnan Khashoggi Sports and Convocation Center began. Financed with $5 million from and named for Saudi Arabian Trustee Adnan Khashoggi, the building was intended to update athletics facilities and provide a new arena, as well as a parking garage and office space for administrative services. Costing an estimated $19 million, the building represented the largest construction project to date but met protest by both faculty and students to the university&#x27;s use of Khashoggi&#x27;s name on the building due to his involvement in the international arms trade.

In 1988, the College of Public and International Affairs was reorganized to create two free-standing schools: the School of International Service and the School of Public Affairs, incorporating the School of Government and Public Administration and the School of Justice. That same year, construction of the Adnan Khashoggi Sports Center was completed while the Iran–Contra Affair controversy was at its height, although his name remained on the building until after Khashoggi defaulted on his donation obligation in the mid-to-late 1990s.

The School of Communication became independent from the College of Arts and Sciences in 1993.

In 1997, American University of Sharjah, the only coeducational, liberal arts university in the United Arab Emirates, signed a two-year contract with AU to provide academic management. This contract has since been extended multiple times through August 2009. A team of senior AU administrators relocated to Sharjah to assist in the establishment of the university and guide it through the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools accreditation process.

===21st century===
In fall 2005, the new Katzen Arts Center opened.

Benjamin Ladner was suspended from his position as president of the university on August 24, 2005, pending an investigation into possible misuse of university funds for his personal expenses. University faculty passed votes of no confidence in President Ladner the following month. One month after the faculty vote, the board of trustees decided that Ladner would not return to American University as its president. 

Cornelius M. Kerwin, a long-time AU administrator, was appointed interim president. On September 1, 2007, Kerwin was appointed to the position permanently after two outsiders declined an offer from the board of trustees. According to &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, Ladner received total compensation of $4,270,665 in his final year of service, the second-highest of any university president in the nation.

Ground was broken for the new School of International Service building on November 14, 2007, and completed in 2010. A speech was given by Senator Daniel K. Inouye (D-HI).

In 2015, American University began offering an accredited, accelerated online MBA program.

In May 2017, Kerwin retired as AU&#x27;s president. In early August 2023, Sylvia Mathews Burwell announced she would be stepping down as AU&#x27;s 15th president and continue working for AU&#x27;s Sine Institute for Policy and Politics. 

On July 1, 2024, Jonathan Alger became AU&#x27;s 16th president.

In 2017, Taylor Dumpson became AU&#x27;s first female black student body president. In her first full day in office, bananas were found at three places on campus, hanging from noose-like ropes, and marked with the initials &quot;AKA&quot;, which are also the initials of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. The university considered the incident to be racist, and then-president Neil Kerwin called it a &quot;cowardly, despicable act.&quot; In May 2018, the school said it had exhausted &quot;all credible leads&quot; about who had perpetrated the incident.

Also in May 2018, Dumpson filed a lawsuit against several people, including Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi website &quot;The Daily Stormer&quot;. She accused Anglin of organizing a racist and sexist trolling campaign against her. She alleged that Anglin posted her name, her picture, links to her Facebook page, and the Twitter page of the university&#x27;s student government, and urged his readers to &quot;troll storm&quot; her, which resulted in many hate-filled and racist online messages directed at her. A federal judge ordered the defendants to pay more than $101,000 in compensatory damages, $500,000 in punitive damages, and more than $124,000 in attorney&#x27;s fees. Dumpson also entered a restraining order against him. Although Dumpson and Anglin have not settled, she settled in December 2018 with one of the people who harassed her, a man from Oregon who was required to apologize, to renounce white supremacy, to stop trolling and doxing online, and to provide information to and cooperate with authorities in the prosecution of white supremacists.

In 2019, the School of Education (SOE) split from the College of Arts and Sciences. According to Cheryl Holcomb-McCoy (Dean of SOE) the move was made to &quot;encourage more students to pursue careers in education&quot;. Areas of study that students can pursue within the school include: teacher education, special education, education policy, and leadership and international education. The school is home to the Institute for Innovation in Education and the newly created Center for Postsecondary Readiness and Success.

On April 22, 2020, AU announced that it had divested its endowment of fossil fuels, becoming one of the first universities in the United States to completely divest of both direct and indirect fossil fuel holdings. Following a student referendum in favor of divestment, the AU board of trustees voted against divesting the endowment in 2014. The decision to divest in 2020 came after extensive student campaigning from groups like Fossil Free AU and the undergraduate student government. In 2020, Fossil Free AU pushed for a second student referendum on the subject, and the student government released a report on divestment, presented to the board of trustees by student comptroller Robert Zitzmann.

==Campuses==

American University has two contiguous campuses for academics and student housing: the main campus on Massachusetts Avenue and the East Campus on Nebraska Avenue Washington College of Law has since been moved to the site of the Tenley Campus located in Tenleytown. AU owns several other buildings in Tenleytown, Spring Valley, East Campus in Wesley Heights, and American University Park areas.
The first design for the campus was done by Frederick Law Olmsted. However, it was significantly modified over time due to financial constraints. The campus occupies adjacent to Ward Circle, the intersection of Nebraska and Massachusetts Avenues. AU&#x27;s campus is predominantly surrounded by the affluent residential neighborhoods characteristic of the Northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C. The campus includes a main quadrangle surrounded by academic buildings, nine residential halls, a 5,000-seat arena, and an outdoor amphitheater. The campus has been designated a public garden and arboretum by the American Public Gardens Association, with many foreign and exotic plants and trees dotting the landscape.

===Tenley Campus===
Formerly the Immaculata School, Tenley Campus is located half a mile east of the main campus and was purchased by American University in 1987 specifically for the Washington Semester program. Since 2016, Tenley Campus has been home to American University&#x27;s law school, the Washington College of Law. Over several years, former dormitory halls and academic buildings were torn down and replaced with many newer, more contemporary academic buildings that now house the Washington College of Law. Graduates are reportedly saddled with enormous amounts of debt, and in 2022 only 69% of graduates held jobs that required they pass the Bar.

==Academics==
The university is composed of eight divisions, referred to as colleges or schools, which house its academic programs. Except for WCL, undergraduate and graduate courses are housed within the same division, although organized into different programs. These colleges and schools are:
* College of Arts &amp; Sciences (CAS)
* Kogod School of Business (KSB)
* School of Communication (SOC)
* School of Education (SOE)
* School of International Service (SIS)
* Professional Studies and Executive Education
* School of Public Affairs (SPA)
* Washington College of Law (WCL)

American University is also home to a unique program known as the Washington Semester Program. This program partners with institutions around the world to bring students to AU for a semester. The program operates as part of the School of Professional &amp; Extended Studies. The program combines two seminar courses three days a week with a two-day-per-week internship that gives students a unique look at Washington, D.C.

===Admissions and student demographics===
Admission to American is considered to be &quot;more selective&quot; by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. For the Class of 2023 (enrolling fall 2019), AU received 18,545 freshmen applications; 6,691 were admitted (36%) and 1,755 enrolled.

<text>Vitoria-Gasteiz (; ; also historically spelled Vittoria in English) is the seat of government and the capital city of the Basque Country and of the province of Álava in northern Spain. It holds the autonomous community&#x27;s House of Parliament, the headquarters of the Government, and the Lehendakari&#x27;s (Prime Minister&#x27;s) official residency. The municipality—which comprises not only the city but also the mainly agricultural lands of 63 villages around—is the largest in the Basque Country, with a total area of , and it has a population of 253,093 (January 2021). The dwellers of Vitoria-Gasteiz are called &quot;vitorianos&quot; or &quot;gasteiztarrak&quot;, while traditionally they are dubbed &quot;babazorros&quot; (Basque for &#x27;bean sacks&#x27;).

Vitoria-Gasteiz is a dynamic city with strengths in healthcare, aeronautics, the automotive industry, and viticulture. It is the first Spanish municipality to be awarded the title of European Green Capital (in 2012) and it has been also recognized by the UN with the Global Green City Award (in 2019). The old town has some of the best preserved medieval streets and plazas in the region and it is one of very few cities with two cathedrals. The city also holds well known festivals such as the Azkena rock festival, FesTVal, Vitoria-Gasteiz jazz festival, and the Virgen Blanca Festivities.

Vitoria-Gasteiz&#x27;s vicinity is home to acclaimed wineries such as Ysios, designed by architect Santiago Calatrava, and Marqués de Riscal, by Frank Gehry. Relevant heritage sites including the Neolithic remains of Aizkomendi, Sorginetxe and La chabola de la Hechicera; Iron Age remains such as the settlements of Lastra and Buradón; antique remains such as the settlement of La Hoya and the salt valley of Añana; and several medieval fortresses including the Tower of Mendoza and the Tower of Varona.

Ludwig van Beethoven dedicated his Opus 91, often called the &quot;Battle of Vitoria&quot; or &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot;, to one of the most famous events of the Napoleonic Wars: the Battle of Vitoria, in which a Spanish, Portuguese and British army under the command of General the Duke of Wellington broke the French army and nearly captured the puppet king Joseph Bonaparte. It was a pivotal point in the Peninsular War, and a precursor to the expulsion of the French army from Spain. A memorial statue can be seen today in Virgen Blanca Square.

== Name ==
The official name of Vitoria-Gasteiz is a compound name of its traditional names in and , respectively. By inhabitants, it is still generally referred to as either &quot;Vitoria&quot; or &quot;Gasteiz&quot;, depending on the language spoken. More rarely, it may be referred to by Basque speakers as &quot;Vitorixe&quot;, a Basque form of the Spanish name.

== History ==

In 581 AD, the Visigoth king Liuvigild founded the city of Victoriacum, trying to emulate the Roman foundations, as a celebration of the victory against the Vascones near what is assumed to be the hill occupied by the primitive village of Gasteiz. This however is not sufficiently proven, and some historians and experts believe that Victoriacum was located not on the site of present-day Vitoria-Gasteiz but nearby. Several possible locations have been proposed, the foremost of which is the late Roman military camp of Iruña-Veleia (cf. J. M. Lacarra). Veleia is located some 11 km north of modern Vitoria, on the banks of the same river. However, modern archeological studies of the site suggest that Veleia was last inhabited , and archeologists are still to find a 6th-century Visigothic resettlement in the site. Another theory has suggested that Victoriacum was located at the foot of Mount Gorbea where there is a village called Vitoriano. The town of Armentia, nowadays in the outskirts of Vitoria, has also been proposed as a possible location of Victoriacum. In either case, Victoriacum vanishes from history shortly after its foundation.

In 1181, Sancho the Wise, King of Navarre founded the town of &quot;Nova Victoria&quot; as a defensive outpost on top of a hill at the site of the previous settlement of Gasteiz. The existence of &quot;Gastehiz&quot;, apparently inhabited by Vasconic people, can be traced back to the Middle Ages; it is certain that by the 11th century, prior to the foundation of &quot;Nova Victoria&quot;, the settlement was already walled. It is assumed that Sancho the Wise gave the new city its name in memory of the old settlement of Victoriacum, which must had long since been abandoned. In 1199, the town was besieged for nine months and eventually captured by the troops of Alfonso VIII of Castile, who annexed the town to the Kingdom of Castile. The town was progressively enlarged and in 1431 it was granted a city charter by King Juan II of Castile. In 1463, it was one of the five founding &quot;villas&quot; of the Brotherhood of Álava alongside Sajazarra, Miranda de Ebro, Pancorbo and Salvatierra/Agurain.

The Battle of Vitoria of the Peninsular War occurred near Vitoria-Gasteiz along the river Zadorra on 21 June 1813. An allied British, Portuguese, and Spanish army under General the Marquess of Wellington broke the French army under Joseph Bonaparte and Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. The victory assured the eventual end of French control in Spain. There is a monument commemorating this battle in the main square of the city known as the Monument to Independence.

When news came to Vienna in late July of that year, Johann Nepomuk Mälzel commissioned Ludwig van Beethoven to compose a symphony, the op. 91 Wellingtons Sieg oder die Schlacht bei Vittoria (Wellington&#x27;s Victory, or the Battle of Vitoria) or &quot;Siegessymphonie&quot;.

Work began on the Institute for Middle Education in 1843, with classes beginning during the 1853–54 academic year. It is now current headquarters of the Basque Parliament and formerly the convent of Santa Clara. The Free University opened in the wake of the revolution of 1868. The university operated from 1869, to just prior to the 1873–1874 term, largely because of the second Carlist War. Some of its most notable academics were Ricardo Becerro de Bengoa, Julián Apraiz and Federico Baraibar. The latter was also among the first teachers of Basque in Vitoria-Gasteiz as an off-syllabus subject.

===Spanish Civil War===
At the start of the Spanish Civil War Álava and Vitoria were easily captured by the rebel Nationalists led by General Angel García Benítez, assisted by Colonel Camilo Alonso Vega. Vitoria was captured on 19 July 1936. In November 1936 an attempt by Republicans to retake Vitoria was thwarted after being spotted by Nationalist reconnaissance aircraft. The 1937 Nationalist campaign in Vizcaya was supported by 80 German aircraft based at Vitoria, where the Condor Legion fighter wing was concentrated.

===Transition to democracy===
During the Spanish transition to democracy, the Church of St. Francis of Assisi was the scene of a police shooting on March 3, 1976 during a peaceful labour assembly. Under the orders of Interior Minister Manuel Fraga, the police shot tear-gas into the church where 5,000 demonstrators and others had met, firing on them as they struggled their way out of the building. It resulted in five dead and over one hundred wounded by gunshot.

On 20 May 1980, by decision of the Basque Parliament, Vitoria-Gasteiz became the place of the common institutions of the Basque Autonomous Community.

===Judizmendi===

Historically, there once was a Jewish community living in Vitoria, before the expulsion of the Jews. In 1492, the year of the expulsion, the town council agreed to maintain and respect the Jewish cemetery, which became known as Judimendi, or &quot;mountain of the Jews&quot; in Basque. Over time, linguistically, &quot;Judimendi&quot; became &quot;Judizmendi.&quot; Unique to anywhere else in Spain, the town maintained this agreement from 1492-1952, when the town undertook plans to convert Judizmendi to a public garden. The Jewish community in Bayonne heard about these plans, and convinced the city government of Vitoria-Gasteiz to commemorate the memory of the cemetery. In 2004, Israeli artist Yaël Artsi created the monument &quot;Coexistence&quot; to be displayed at Judizmendi.

In 2017, the monument was vandalized with anti-semitic graffiti twice: once in April, and once in May.

In 2019, the Basque Jewish community held a ceremony to pay tribute to the city for honoring its promise to the Jews.

== Climate ==
Vitoria-Gasteiz has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Winters are much cooler than in lowland coastal areas, whilst summers are similar in terms of high temperatures, with cool nights due to the elevation. Summers show a significant influence of mediterranean precipitation patterns, but enough precipitation usually occurs to remain marine in nature. Sunshine levels are low by Spanish standards and the climate is humid year-round.

==Urbanism==


From an urban point of view, Vitoria-Gasteiz is a mid-sized city, the line of which is adapted to the traditions of each historical moment. The medieval town is set in almond-shape around the hill foundation, which by its privileged position as the only elevation in the plain of Álava, became a defensive stronghold coveted by the kingdoms of Navarre and Castilla during the 11th and 12th centuries. The walled enclosure was built prior to the war between Castile and Navarre in the 11th century to defend the village. The defensive walls of old Gasteiz were built between the years 1050 and 1100. Because of that first defensive role, its narrow streets surrounding the oval resulted in compact rows of houses parallel both to each other and the medieval walls (of which only some sections and gates are preserved). Between the years 1854 and 1856, an epidemic of cholera served as the excuse for tearing down the gates, fortresses which provided access to the streets Run (fort of Nanclares), Shoe (fort of Soto) and Blacksmith (fort of Abendaño) and which served to protect every neighbourhood association. The entrance of the current &quot;Plaza de la Virgen Blanca&quot; was the site of Santa Clara, which was joined by the wall at the Convent of San Antonio. In the 19th century, in recognition that the city was small, an expansion was planned in the neoclassical style, and little by little planning for the city has given Vitoria-Gasteiz its current form.

The Old Quarter (&quot;Alde Zaharra&quot;/&quot;Casco Viejo&quot;), has many architectural jewels such as Bendaña Palace, the Fournier Museum of cards (erected in 1525 by Juan Lopez de Arrieta, on the site occupied before by the defensive tower built by Maeztu). The Ezkoriatza-Eskibel Palace, built by Claudio de Arciniega in the 15th century. The Villa Suso, where Martin Salinas, ambassador of Charles V dwelt (16th century). And the greatest historical treasure of Vitoria-Gasteiz: the Cathedral of Santa Maria (Old Cathedral).

The history of the Cathedral of Santa María (commonly known as &quot;Old Cathedral&quot;), is itself a synthesis of the history of Vitoria-Gasteiz. Built on the cemetery of the primitive village of Gasteiz (which today can be accessed through the excavations), the church of Santa María collapsed with the fire of 1202 and Alfonso VIII of Castile (who had conquered the city just 2 years earlier), ordered that it be rebuilt on the site of a former church. It was now to serve two very different purposes: regular religious services and weapon storage. Thus was born the Cathedral of Santa Maria, a fortress-like church that served as the entrance to the city. The project changed with the centuries, so that each modification was made without taking into account the previous. This was the case in the 15th century (when the church became collegiate), and finally in the 1960s, when it was decided to reverse the previous works of strengthening of the external walls and widen the windows, made purely for aesthetic reasons, which had severely damaged the stability of the building. Today, the cathedral is open again, and offers visitors guided trips exposing the recent archaeological findings. It has become one of the main attractions of Vitoria-Gasteiz. Ken Follett, author of &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;, said after his stay in the city that Santa Maria was one of the three most interesting cathedrals of the world.

From the Middle Ages to the 18th century, the population of Vitoria-Gasteiz and the layout of its streets remained almost unchanged. And it was not until the late 18th century, when growth required the expansion of the city outside. To solve the problem of the difference in height between the original kernel on the hill, and the plain below, the arches were erected and the Plaza De España or Plaza Nueva was built, which soften the transition from the old city to the 19th century neoclassical expansion of wide streets and gardens, the greatest examples of which are seen in the &quot;La Florida&quot; Park, and the &quot;Andre Maria Zuriaren Enparantza/Plaza de la Virgen Blanca&quot;, with its façade pulled viewpoints.

Finally, the new quarters of Vitoria-Gasteiz were built, in accordance with a development plan favouring parks, recreation areas and quality of life. While aiming to maintain the identity of the city, and drawing on the district of San Martín, the need to accommodate the growing population has led the city to concentrate its growth in the new neighbourhoods of Lakua, Salburua and Zabalgan. The city of Vitoria-Gasteiz has received several international awards for its urban development. Also worth mentioning is the green ring, a network of parks and green spaces around the city, destined to be the lung of the future Vitoria-Gasteiz, and link the city with the countryside. This ring is formed of the parks Salburua, Zabalgana, Armentia, Alegria river, Gamarra, Abetxuko and Atxa-Landaberde.

<doc id="80740" wikidata="Q190706" url="?curid=80740" title="Moon landing conspiracy theories">
<text>Moon landing conspiracy theories claim that some or all elements of the Apollo program and the associated Moon landings were hoaxes staged by NASA, possibly with the aid of other organizations. The most notable claim of these conspiracy theories is that the six crewed landings (1969–1972) were faked and that twelve Apollo astronauts did not actually land on the Moon. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions, and Moon rock samples.

Much third-party evidence for the landings exists, and detailed rebuttals to the hoax claims have been made. Since the late 2000s, high-definition photos taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) of the Apollo landing sites have captured the Lunar Module descent stages and the tracks left by the astronauts. In 2012, images were released showing five of the six Apollo missions&#x27; American flags erected on the Moon still standing. The exception is that of Apollo 11, which has lain on the lunar surface since being blown over by the Lunar Module Ascent Propulsion System.

Reputable experts in science and astronomy regard the claims as pseudoscience and demonstrably false. Opinion polls taken in various locations between 1994 and 2009 have shown that between 6% and 20% of Americans, 25% of Britons, and 28% of Russians surveyed believe that the crewed landings were faked. Even as late as 2001, the Fox television network documentary &quot;Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?&quot; claimed NASA faked the first landing in 1969 to win the Space Race.

== Origins ==
An early and influential book about the subject of a Moon-landing conspiracy, &quot;We Never Went to the Moon: America&#x27;s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle&quot;, was self-published in 1976 by Bill Kaysing, a former US Navy officer with a Bachelor of Arts in English. Despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing, Kaysing was hired as a senior technical writer in 1956 by Rocketdyne, the company that built the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V rocket. He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company&#x27;s Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. The many allegations in Kaysing&#x27;s book effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked. The book claims that the chance of a successful crewed landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the USSR, it would have been easier for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.

In 1980, the Flat Earth Society accused NASA of faking the landings, arguing that they were staged by Hollywood with Walt Disney sponsorship, based on a script by Arthur C. Clarke and directed by Stanley Kubrick. Folklorist Linda Dégh suggests that writer-director Peter Hyams&#x27; film &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (1978), which shows a hoaxed journey to Mars in a spacecraft that looks identical to the Apollo craft, might have given a boost to the hoax theory&#x27;s popularity in the post-Vietnam War era. Dégh sees a parallel with other attitudes during the post-Watergate era, when the American public were inclined to distrust official accounts. Dégh writes: &quot;The mass media catapult these half-truths into a kind of twilight zone where people can make their guesses sound as truths. Mass media have a terrible impact on people who lack guidance.&quot; In &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot;, first published in 1994, Andrew Chaikin mentions that at the time of Apollo 8&#x27;s lunar-orbit mission in December 1968, similar conspiracy ideas were already in circulation.

== Claimed motives of the United States and NASA ==
Those who believe the Moon landings were faked offer several theories about the motives of NASA and the United States government. The three main theories are below.

=== Space Race ===
Motivation for the United States to engage the Soviet Union in a Space Race can be traced to the Cold War. Landing on the Moon was viewed as a national and technological accomplishment that would generate world-wide acclaim. But going to the Moon would be risky and expensive, as exemplified by President John F. Kennedy famously stating in a 1962 speech that the United States chose to go it was hard.

Hoax theory debunker Phil Plait says in his 2002 book &quot;Bad Astronomy&quot; that the Soviets – with their own competing Moon program, an extensive intelligence network and a formidable scientific community able to analyze NASA data – would have &quot;cried foul&quot; if the United States tried to fake a Moon landing, especially since their own program had failed. Proving a hoax would have been a huge propaganda win for the Soviets. Instead, far from calling the landings a hoax, the third edition (1970–1979) of the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; (which was translated into English between 1974 and 1983 by Macmillan Publishers, and was later made available online by TheFreeDictionary.com) contained many articles reporting the landings as factual, such as its article on Neil Armstrong. Indeed their article on space exploration describes the Apollo 11 landing as &quot;the third historic event&quot; of the space age, following the launch of Sputnik in 1957, and Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s flight in 1961.

Conspiracist Bart Sibrel responded, incorrectly asserting that, &quot;the Soviets did not have the capability to track deep space craft until late in 1972, immediately after which, the last three Apollo missions were abruptly canceled.&quot; Those missions were canceled, not abruptly, but for cost-cutting reasons. The announcements were made in January and September 1970, two full years before the &quot;late 1972&quot; claimed by Sibrel. (See Vietnam War below.)

In fact, the Soviets had been sending uncrewed spacecraft to the Moon since 1959, and &quot;during 1962, deep space tracking facilities were introduced at IP-15 in Ussuriisk and IP-16 in Evpatoria (Crimean Peninsula), while Saturn communication stations were added to IP-3, 4 and 14,&quot; the last of which having a range. The Soviet Union tracked the Apollo missions at the Space Transmissions Corps, which was &quot;fully equipped with the latest intelligence-gathering and surveillance equipment.&quot; Vasily Mishin, in an interview for the article &quot;The Moon Programme That Faltered,&quot; describes how the Soviet Moon program dwindled after the Apollo landings.

In May 2023 Dmitry Rogozin, former director general of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, expressed doubt that U.S. astronauts landed on the Moon. He complained of not receiving a satisfactory answer when he asked his agency to provide evidence. He said his colleagues at Roscosmos were angry about his questions and did not want to undermine cooperation with NASA.

=== NASA funding and prestige ===
Conspiracy theorists claim that NASA faked the landings to avoid humiliation and to ensure that it continued to get funding. NASA raised &quot;about US$30 billion&quot; to go to the Moon, and Kaysing claimed in his book that this could have been used to &quot;pay off&quot; many people. Since most conspiracists believe that sending men to the Moon was impossible at the time, they argue that landings had to be faked to fulfill Kennedy&#x27;s 1961 goal, &quot;before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.&quot; In fact, NASA accounted for the cost of Apollo to the US Congress in 1973, totaling US$25.4 billion.

Mary Bennett and David Percy claimed in the 2001 book &quot;Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers&quot;, that, with all the known and unknown hazards, NASA would not risk broadcasting an astronaut getting sick or dying on live television. The counter-argument generally given is that NASA in fact &quot;did&quot; incur a great deal of public humiliation and potential political opposition to the program by losing an entire crew in the Apollo 1 fire during a ground test, leading to its upper management team being questioned by Senate and House of Representatives space oversight committees. There was in fact no video broadcast during either the landing or takeoff because of technological limitations.

=== Vietnam War ===
The American Patriot Friends Network claimed in 2009 that the landings helped the United States government distract public attention from the unpopular Vietnam War, and so crewed landings suddenly ended about the same time that the United States ended its involvement in the war. In fact, the ending of the landings was not &quot;sudden&quot; (see Space Race above). The war was one of several federal budget items with which NASA had to compete; NASA&#x27;s budget peaked in 1966, and fell by 42% by 1972. This was the reason the final flights were cut, along with plans for even more ambitious follow-on programs such as a permanent space station and crewed flight to Mars.

==Hoax claims and rebuttals==
Many Moon-landing conspiracy theories have been proposed, alleging that the landings either did not occur and NASA staff lied, or that the landings did occur but not in the way that has been reported. Conspiracists have focused on perceived gaps or inconsistencies in the historical record of the missions. The foremost idea is that the whole crewed landing program was a hoax from start to end. Some claim that the technology did not exist to send men to the Moon or that the Van Allen radiation belts, solar flares, solar wind, coronal mass ejections, and cosmic rays made such a trip impossible.

Scientists Vince Calder and Andrew Johnson have given detailed answers to conspiracists&#x27; claims on the Argonne National Laboratory website. They show that NASA&#x27;s portrayal of the Moon landing is fundamentally accurate, allowing for such common mistakes as mislabeled photos and imperfect personal recollections. Using the scientific process, any hypothesis may be rejected if it is contradicted by the observable facts. The &quot;real landing&quot; hypothesis is a single story since it comes from a single source, but there is no unity in the hoax hypothesis because hoax accounts vary between conspiracists.

=== Number of conspirators involved ===
According to James Longuski, the conspiracy theories are impossible because of their size and complexity. The conspiracy would have to involve more than 400,000 people who worked on the Apollo project for nearly ten years, the twelve men who walked on the Moon, the six others who flew with them as command module pilots, and another six astronauts who orbited the Moon. Hundreds of thousands of people would have had to keep the secret, including astronauts, scientists, engineers, technicians, and skilled laborers. Longuski argues that it would have been much easier to really land on the Moon than to generate such a huge conspiracy to fake the landings. To date, nobody from the United States government or NASA linked to the Apollo program has said that the Moon landings were hoaxes. Penn Jillette made note of this in the &quot;Conspiracy Theories&quot; episode of his television show &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot; in 2005. Physicist David Robert Grimes estimated the time that it would take for a conspiracy to be exposed based on the number of people involved. His calculations used data from the PRISM surveillance program, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, and the FBI forensic scandal. Grimes estimated that a Moon landing hoax would require the involvement of 411,000 people and would be exposed within 3.68 years. His study did not consider exposure by sources outside of the alleged conspiracy; it only considered exposure from within through whistleblowers or incompetence.

=== Photographic and film oddities ===

Moon-landing conspiracists focus heavily on NASA photos, pointing to oddities in photos and films taken on the Moon. Photography experts (including those unrelated to NASA) have replied that the oddities are consistent with what should be expected from a real Moon landing, and are not consistent with manipulated or studio imagery. Some main arguments (set in plain text) and counter-arguments (set in italics) are listed below.

1. In some photos, the crosshairs appear to be behind objects. The cameras were fitted with a Réseau plate (a clear glass plate with a reticle etched on), making it impossible for any photographed object to appear in front of the grid. Conspiracists often use this evidence to suggest that objects were &quot;pasted&quot; over the photographs, and hence obscure the reticle.

:* &quot;This effect only appears in copied and scanned photos, not any originals. It is caused by overexposure: the bright white areas of the emulsion &quot;bleed&quot; over the thin black crosshairs. The crosshairs are only about 0.004 inches thick (0.1 mm) and emulsion would only have to bleed about half that much to fully obscure it. Furthermore, there are many photos where the middle of the crosshair is &quot;washed-out&quot; but the rest is intact. In some photos of the American flag, parts of one crosshair appear on the red stripes, but parts of the same crosshair are faded or invisible on the white stripes. There would have been no reason to &quot;paste&quot; white stripes onto the flag.&quot;

2. Crosshairs are sometimes rotated or in the wrong place.

:* &quot;This is a result of popular photos being cropped or rotated for aesthetic impact.&quot;

3. The quality of the photographs is implausibly high.

:* &quot;There are many poor quality photos taken by the Apollo astronauts. NASA chose to publish only the best examples.&quot;
:* &quot;The Apollo astronauts used high-resolution Hasselblad 500 EL cameras with Carl Zeiss optics and a 70 mm medium format film magazine.&quot;

4. There are no stars in any of the photos; the Apollo 11 astronauts also stated in post-mission press conferences that they did not remember seeing any stars during extravehicular activity (EVA). Conspiracists contend that NASA chose not to put the stars into the photos because astronomers would have been able to use them to determine whether the photos were taken from the Earth or the Moon, by means of identifying them and comparing their celestial position and parallax to what would be expected for either observation site.

:* &quot;The astronauts were talking about naked-eye sightings of stars during the lunar daytime. They regularly sighted stars through the spacecraft navigation optics while aligning their inertial reference platforms, the Apollo PGNCS.&quot;

:* &quot;Stars are rarely seen in Space Shuttle, Mir, Earth observation photos, or even photos taken at sporting events held at night. The light from the Sun in outer space in the Earth-Moon system is at least as bright as the sunlight that reaches the Earth&#x27;s surface on a clear day at noon, so cameras used for imaging subjects illuminated by sunlight are set for a daylight exposure. The dim light of the stars simply does not provide enough exposure to record visible images. All crewed landings happened during the lunar daytime. Thus, the stars were outshone by the Sun and by sunlight reflected off the Moon&#x27;s surface. The astronauts&#x27; eyes were adapted to the sunlit landscape around them so that they could not see the relatively faint stars. The astronauts could see stars with the naked eye only when they were in the shadow of the Moon.&quot;

:* &quot;Camera settings can turn a well-lit background to black when the foreground object is brightly lit, forcing the camera to increase shutter speed so that the foreground light does not wash out the image. A demonstration of this effect is here. The effect is similar to not being able to see stars from a brightly lit parking lot at night; the stars only become visible when the lights are turned off.&quot;

:* &quot;The Far Ultraviolet Camera was taken to the lunar surface on Apollo 16 and operated in the shadow of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM). It took photos of Earth and of many stars, some of which are dim in visible light but bright in the ultraviolet. These observations were later matched with observations taken by orbiting ultraviolet telescopes. Furthermore, the positions of those stars with respect to Earth are correct for the time and location of the Apollo 16 photos.&quot;

:* &quot;Photos of the solar corona that included the planet Mercury and some background stars were taken from lunar orbit by Apollo 15 Command Module Pilot Al Worden&quot;.

:* &quot;Photos of the planet Venus were taken from the Moon&#x27;s surface by astronaut Alan Shepard during the Apollo 14 mission.&quot;

5. The angle and color of shadows are inconsistent. This suggests that artificial lights were used.

:* &quot;Shadows on the Moon are complicated by reflected light, uneven ground, wide-angle lens distortion, and lunar dust. There are several light sources: the Sun, sunlight reflected from the Earth, sunlight reflected from the Moon&#x27;s surface, and sunlight reflected from the astronauts and the Lunar Module. Light from these sources is scattered by lunar dust in many directions, including into shadows. Shadows falling into craters and hills may appear longer, shorter, and distorted. Furthermore, shadows display the properties of vanishing point perspective, leading them to converge to a point on the horizon.&quot;
:* This theory was further debunked on the &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode &quot;NASA Moon Landing&quot;.

6. There are identical backgrounds in photos which were allegedly taken miles apart. This suggests that a painted background was used.

:* &quot;Backgrounds were not identical, just similar. What appear as nearby hills in some photos are actually mountains many miles away. On Earth, objects that are farther away will appear fainter and less detailed. On the Moon, there is no atmosphere or haze to obscure far-away objects, thus they appear clearer and nearer. Furthermore, there are very few objects such as trees to help judge distance. One such case is debunked in &quot;Who Mourns For Apollo?&quot; by Mike Bara.&quot;

7. The number of photos taken is implausibly high—up to one photo per 50 seconds.

:* &quot;Simplified gear with fixed settings allowed two photos a second. Many were taken immediately after each other as stereo pairs or panorama sequences. The calculation (one per 50 seconds) was based on a lone astronaut on the surface, and does not take into account that there were two astronauts sharing the workload and simultaneously taking photographs during an Extra-vehicular activity (EVA).&quot;

8. The photos contain artifacts like the two seemingly matching &quot;C&quot;s on a rock and on the ground. These may be labeled studio props.

:* &quot;The C-shaped objects are most likely printing imperfections and do not appear in the original film from the camera. It has been suggested that the &quot;C&quot; is a coiled hair.&quot;

9. A woman named Una Ronald (a pseudonym created by the authors of the source) from Perth, Australia, said that she saw a Coca-Cola bottle roll across the lower right quadrant of her television screen that was displaying the live broadcast of the Apollo 11 EVA. She also said that several letters appeared in &quot;The West Australian&quot; discussing the Coca-Cola bottle incident within ten days of the lunar landing.

:* &quot;No such newspaper reports or recordings have been found. Ronald&#x27;s claims have only been relayed by one source. There are also flaws in the story, such as the statement that she had to stay up late to watch the Moon landing live, which is easily discounted by many witnesses in Australia who watched the landing in the middle of the daytime.&quot;

10. The 1994 book &quot;Moon Shot&quot; contains an obviously fake composite photo of Alan Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon with another astronaut.

:* &quot; It was used instead of the only existing real images from the TV monitor, which the editors seemingly felt were too grainy for their book. The book publishers did not work for NASA, although the authors were retired NASA astronauts.&quot;

11. There appear to be &quot;hot spots&quot; in some photos which look as though a large spotlight was used in place of the Sun.

:* &quot; Pits on the Moon&#x27;s surface focus and reflect light like the tiny glass spheres used in the coating of street signs, or dewdrops on wet grass. This creates a glow around the photographer&#x27;s own shadow when it appears in a photograph (see Heiligenschein).&quot;
:* &quot;If the astronaut is standing in sunlight while photographing into shade, light reflected off his white spacesuit yields a similar effect to a spotlight.&quot;
:* &quot;Some widely published Apollo photos were high-contrast copies. Scans of the original transparencies are generally much more evenly lit. An example is shown below:&quot;

12. Who filmed Neil Armstrong stepping onto the Moon?

:* &quot;Cameras on the Lunar Module did. The Apollo TV camera mounted in the Modularized Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) of the Apollo Lunar Module gave a view from the exterior. While still on the Module&#x27;s ladder steps, Armstrong deployed the MESA from the side of the Lunar Module, unpacking the TV camera. The camera was then powered on and a signal transmitted back to Earth. This meant that upwards of 600 million people on Earth could watch the live feed with only a very slight delay. Similar technology was also used on subsequent Apollo missions.&quot; &quot;It was also filmed from an automatic 16mm movie camera mounted in a window of the Lunar Module.&quot;

=== Environment ===
1. The astronauts could not have survived the trip because of exposure to radiation from the Van Allen radiation belt and galactic ambient radiation (see radiation poisoning and health threat from cosmic rays). Some conspiracists have suggested that Starfish Prime (a high-altitude nuclear test in 1962) formed another intense layer on the Van Allen belt.

:* &quot;There are two main Van Allen belts – the inner belt and the outer belt – and a transient third belt. The inner belt is the more dangerous one, containing energetic protons. The outer one has less-dangerous low-energy electrons (Beta particles). The Apollo spacecraft passed through the inner belt in a matter of minutes and the outer belt in about hours. The astronauts were shielded from the ionizing radiation by the aluminum hulls of the spacecraft. Furthermore, the orbital transfer trajectory from Earth to the Moon through the belts was chosen to lessen radiation exposure. Even James Van Allen, the discoverer of the Van Allen belt, rebutted the claims that radiation levels were too harmful for the Apollo missions. Phil Plait cited an average dose of less than 1 rem (10 mSv), which is equivalent to the ambient radiation received by living at sea level for three years. The total radiation received on the trip was about the same as allowed for workers in the nuclear energy field for a year&quot; &quot;and not much more than what Space Shuttle astronauts received.&quot;

2. Film in the cameras would have been fogged by this radiation.

:* &quot;The film was kept in metal containers that stopped radiation from fogging the emulsion. Furthermore, film was not fogged in lunar probes such as the Lunar Orbiter and Luna 3 (which used on-board film development processes).&quot;

3. The Moon&#x27;s surface during the daytime is so hot that camera film would have melted.

:* &quot;There is no atmosphere to efficiently bind lunar surface heat to devices that are not in direct contact with it. In a vacuum, only radiation remains as a heat transfer mechanism. The physics of radiative heat transfer are thoroughly understood, and the proper use of passive optical coatings and paints was enough to control the temperature of the film within the cameras; Lunar Module temperatures were controlled with similar coatings that gave them a gold color. The Moon&#x27;s surface does get very hot at lunar noon, but every Apollo landing was made shortly after lunar sunrise at the landing site; the Moon&#x27;s day is about Earth days long, meaning that one Moon day (dawn to dusk) lasts nearly fifteen Earth days. During the longer stays, the astronauts did notice increased cooling loads on their spacesuits as the sun and surface temperature continued to rise, but the effect was easily countered by the passive and active cooling systems. The film was not in direct sunlight, so it was not overheated.&quot;

4. The Apollo 16 crew could not have survived a big solar flare firing out when they were on their way to the Moon.

:* &quot;No large solar flare occurred during the flight of Apollo 16. There were large solar flares in August 1972, after Apollo 16 returned to Earth and before the flight of Apollo 17.&quot;

5. The flag placed on the surface by the astronauts fluttered despite there being no wind on the Moon. This suggests that it was filmed on Earth and a breeze caused it to flutter. Sibrel said that it may have been caused by indoor fans used to cool the astronauts, since their spacesuit cooling systems would have been too heavy on Earth.

:* &quot;The flag was fastened to an &quot;Г-&quot;shaped rod (see Lunar Flag Assembly) so that it did not hang down. It only seemed to flutter when the astronauts were moving it into position. Without air drag, these movements caused the free corner of the flag to swing like a pendulum for some time. It was rippled because it had been folded during storage, and the ripples could be mistaken for movement in a still photo. Videos show that, when the astronauts let go of the flagpole, it vibrates briefly but then remains still&quot;.
:* This theory was further debunked on the &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode &quot;NASA Moon Landing&quot;.

6. Footprints in the Moondust are unexpectedly well preserved, despite the lack of moisture.

:* &quot;Moondust has not been weathered like the sand on Earth, and it has sharp edges. This allows the dust particles to stick together and hold their shape in the vacuum. The astronauts likened it to &quot;talcum powder or wet sand&quot;.&quot;
:* This theory was further debunked on the &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode &quot;NASA Moon Landing&quot;.

7. The alleged Moon landings used either a sound stage or were filmed outside in a remote desert with the astronauts either using harnesses or slow-motion photography to make it look like they were on the Moon.

:* &quot;The HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; used the sound-stage and harness setup, as did a scene from the movie &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. It is clearly seen from those films that, when dust rose, it did not quickly settle; some dust briefly formed clouds. In the film footage from the Apollo missions, dust kicked up by the astronauts&#x27; boots and the wheels of the Lunar Roving Vehicles rose quite high due to the lower lunar gravity, and it settled quickly to the ground in an uninterrupted parabolic arc since there was no air to suspend it. Even if there had been a sound stage for hoax Moon landings that had the air pumped out, the dust would have reached nowhere near the height and trajectory as in the Apollo film footage because of Earth&#x27;s greater gravity.&quot;

:* &quot;During the Apollo 15 mission, David Scott did an experiment by dropping a hammer and a falcon feather at the same time. Both fell at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time. This proved that he was in a vacuum.&quot;

:* &quot;If the landings were filmed outside in a desert, heat waves would be present on the surface in mission videos, but no such heat waves exist in the footage. If the landings were filmed in a sound stage, several anomalies would occur, including a lack of parallax, and an increase or decrease in the size of the backdrop if the camera moved. Footage was filmed while the rover was in motion, and yet no evidence is present of any change in the size of the background.&quot;

:* This theory was further debunked on the &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode &quot;NASA Moon Landing&quot;.

=== Mechanical issues ===
1. The Lunar Modules made no blast craters or any sign of dust scatter.

:* &quot;No crater should be expected. The thrust Descent Propulsion System was throttled down very far during the final landing. The Lunar Module was no longer quickly decelerating, so the descent engine only had to support the lander&#x27;s own weight, which was lessened by the Moon&#x27;s gravity and by the near exhaustion of the descent propellants. At landing, the engine thrust divided by the nozzle exit area is only about .&quot;

::&quot;Beyond the engine nozzle, the plume spreads, and the pressure drops very quickly. Rocket exhaust gasses expand much more quickly after leaving the engine nozzle in a vacuum than in an atmosphere. The effect of an atmosphere on rocket plumes can be easily seen in launches from Earth; as the rocket rises through the thinning atmosphere, the exhaust plumes broaden very noticeably. To lessen this, rocket engines made for vacuums have longer bells than those made for use on Earth, but they still cannot stop this spreading. The lander&#x27;s exhaust gases, therefore, expanded quickly well beyond the landing site. The descent engines &quot;did&quot; scatter a lot of very fine surface dust as seen in 16mm movies of each landing, and many mission commanders spoke of its effect on visibility. The landers were generally moving horizontally as well as vertically, and photos do show scouring of the surface along the final descent path. Finally, the lunar regolith is very compact below its surface dust layer, making it impossible for the descent engine to blast out a crater. A blast crater was measured under the Apollo 11 lander using shadow lengths of the descent engine bell and estimates of the amount that the landing gear had compressed and how deep the lander footpads had pressed into the lunar surface, and it was found that the engine had eroded between of regolith out from underneath the engine bell during the final descent and landing.&quot;

2. The second stage of the launch rocket or the Lunar Module ascent stage or both made no visible flame.

:* &quot;The Lunar Modules used Aerozine 50 (fuel) and dinitrogen tetroxide (oxidizer) propellants, chosen for simplicity and reliability; they ignite hypergolically (upon contact) without the need for a spark. These propellants produce a nearly transparent exhaust. The same fuel was used by the core of the American Titan II rocket. The transparency of their plumes is apparent in many launch photos. The plumes of rocket engines fired in a vacuum spread out very quickly as they leave the engine nozzle (see above), further lessening their visibility. Finally, rocket engines often run &quot;rich&quot; to slow internal corrosion. On Earth, the excess fuel burns in contact with atmospheric oxygen, enhancing the visible flame. This cannot happen in a vacuum.&quot;


3. The Lunar Modules weighed 17 tons and made no mark on the Moondust, yet footprints can be seen beside them.

:* &quot;On the surface of the Earth, Apollo 11&#x27;s fueled and crewed Lunar Module Eagle would have weighed approximately . On the surface of the Moon, however, after expending fuel and oxidizer on its descent from lunar orbit, the lander weighed about . The astronauts were much lighter than the lander, but their boots were much smaller than the lander&#x27;s approximately diameter footpads. Pressure (or force per unit area) rather than mass determines the amount of regolith compression. In some photos, the footpads did press into the regolith, especially when they moved sideways at touchdown. (The bearing pressure under Apollo 11&#x27;s footpads, with the lander being about 44 times the weight of an EVA-configured astronaut, would have been of similar magnitude to the bearing pressure exerted by the astronauts&#x27; boots.)&quot;

4. The air conditioning units that were part of the astronauts&#x27; spacesuits could not have worked in an environment of no atmosphere.

:* &quot;The cooling units could only work in a vacuum. Water from a tank in the backpack flowed out through tiny pores in a metal sublimator plate where it quickly vaporized into space. The loss of the heat of vaporization froze the remaining water, forming a layer of ice on the outside of the plate that also sublimated into space (turning from a solid directly into a gas). A separate water loop flowed through the LCG (Liquid Cooling Garment) worn by the astronaut, carrying his metabolic waste heat through the sublimator plate where it was cooled and returned to the LCG. The of feedwater gave about eight hours of cooling; because of its bulk, it was often the limiting consumable on the length of an EVA.&quot;

=== Transmissions ===
1. There should have been more than a two-second delay in communications between Earth and the Moon, at a distance of .

:* &quot;The round-trip light travel time of more than two seconds is apparent in all the real-time recordings of the lunar audio, but this does not always appear as expected. There may also be some documentary films where the delay has been edited out. Reasons for editing the audio may be time constraints or in the interest of clarity.&quot;

2. Typical delays in communication were about 0.5 seconds.

:* &quot;Claims that the delays were only half a second are untrue, as examination of the original recordings shows. Also, there should not be a consistent time delay between every response, as the conversation is being recorded at one end by Mission Control. Responses from Mission Control could be heard without any delay, as the recording is being made at the same time that Houston receives the transmission from the Moon.&quot;

3. The Parkes Observatory in Australia was billed to the world for weeks as the site that would be relaying communications from the first moonwalk. However, five hours before transmission they were told to stand down.

:* &quot;The timing of the first moonwalk was changed after the landing. In fact, delays in getting the moonwalk started meant that Parkes did cover almost the entire Apollo 11 moonwalk.&quot;

4. Parkes supposedly had the clearest video feed from the Moon, but Australian media and all other known sources ran a live feed from the United States.

:* &quot;That was the original plan and the official policy, but the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) did take the transmission direct from the Parkes and Honeysuckle Creek radio telescopes. These were converted to NTSC television at Paddington in Sydney. This meant that Australian viewers saw the moonwalk several seconds before the rest of the world. See also Parkes radio astronomer John Sarkissian&#x27;s article &quot;On Eagle&#x27;s Wings: The Parkes Observatory&#x27;s Support of the Apollo 11 Mission&quot;. The events surrounding the Parkes Observatory&#x27;s role in relaying the live television of the moonwalk were portrayed in a slightly fictionalized Australian film comedy &quot;The Dish&quot; (2000).&quot;

5. Better signal was supposedly received at Parkes Observatory when the Moon was on the opposite side of the planet.

:* &quot;This is not supported by the detailed evidence and logs from the missions.&quot;

=== Missing data ===
Blueprints and design and development drawings of the machines involved are missing. Apollo 11 data tapes are also missing, containing telemetry and the high-quality video (before scan conversion from slow-scan TV to standard TV) of the first moonwalk.

==== Tapes ====

Dr. David R. Williams (NASA archivist at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 flight director Eugene F. Kranz both acknowledged that the original high-quality Apollo 11 telemetry data tapes are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed. The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a slow-scan television (SSTV) camera (see Apollo TV camera). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a scan conversion had to be done. The radio telescope at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon at the time of the Apollo 11 moonwalk. Parkes had a bigger antenna than NASA&#x27;s antenna in Australia at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, so it received a better picture. It also received a better picture than NASA&#x27;s antenna at Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this original tape that is missing. A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About fifteen minutes of it were filmed by an amateur 8 mm film camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes still exist from the ALSEP scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977), according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.

Others are looking for the missing telemetry tapes for different reasons. The tapes contain the original and highest quality video feed from the Apollo 11 landing. Some former Apollo personnel want to find the tapes for posterity, while NASA engineers looking towards future Moon missions believe that the tapes may be useful for their design studies. They have found that the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984, all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center at their request. The tapes are believed to have been stored rather than re-used. Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967, even before the Moon landings.

In November 2006, COSMOS Online reported that about 100 data tapes recorded in Australia during the Apollo 11 mission had been found in a small marine science laboratory in the main physics building at the Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Australia. One of the old tapes has been sent to NASA for analysis. The slow-scan television images were not on the tape.

In July 2009, NASA indicated that it must have erased the original Apollo 11 Moon footage years ago so that it could re-use the tape. In December 2009, NASA issued a final report on the Apollo 11 telemetry tapes. Senior engineer Dick Nafzger was in charge of the live TV recordings during the Apollo missions, and he was put in charge of the restoration project. After a three-year search, the &quot;inescapable conclusion&quot; was that about 45 tapes (estimated 15 tapes recorded at each of the three tracking stations) of Apollo 11 video were erased and re-used, said Nafzger. Lowry Digital had been tasked with restoring the surviving footage in time for the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing. Lowry Digital president Mike Inchalik said that &quot;this is by far and away the lowest quality&quot; video that the company has dealt with. Nafzger praised Lowry for restoring &quot;crispness&quot; to the Apollo video, which will remain in black and white and contains conservative digital enhancements. The US$230,000 restoration project took months to complete and did not include sound quality improvements. Some selections of restored footage in high definition have been made available on the NASA website.

==== Blueprints ====
Grumman appears to have destroyed most of its LM documentation, but copies exist in microfilm for the blueprints for the Saturn V.

Four mission-worthy Lunar Roving Vehicles (LRV) were built by Boeing. Three of them were carried to the Moon on Apollos 15, 16, and 17, used by the astronauts for transportation on the Moon, and left there. After Apollo 18 was canceled, the other LRV was used for spare parts for the Apollos 15 to 17 missions. The 221-page operation manual for the LRV contains some detailed drawings, although not the blueprints.

=== NASA technology compared to USSR ===

Bart Sibrel cites the relative level of the United States and USSR space technology as evidence that the Moon landings could not have happened. For much of the early stages of the Space Race, the USSR was ahead of the United States, yet in the end, the USSR was never able to fly a crewed spacecraft to the Moon, let alone land one on the surface. It is argued that, because the USSR was unable to do this, the United States should have also been unable to develop the technology to do so.

For example, he claims that, during the Apollo program, the USSR had five times more crewed hours in space than the United States, and notes that the USSR was the first to achieve many of the early milestones in space: the first artificial satellite in orbit (October 1957, Sputnik 1); the first living creature in orbit (a dog named Laika, November 1957, Sputnik 2); the first man in space and in orbit (Yuri Gagarin, April 1961, Vostok 1); the first woman in space (Valentina Tereshkova, June 1963, Vostok 6); and the first spacewalk (Alexei Leonov in March 1965, Voskhod 2).

However, most of the Soviet gains listed above were matched by the United States within a year, and sometimes within weeks. In 1965, the United States started to achieve many firsts (such as the first successful space rendezvous), which were important steps in a mission to the Moon. Furthermore, NASA and others say that these gains by the Soviets are not as impressive as they seem; that a number of these firsts were mere stunts that did not advance the technology greatly, or at all, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the first woman in space. In fact, by the time of the launch of the first crewed Earth-orbiting Apollo flight (Apollo 7), the USSR had made only nine spaceflights (seven with one cosmonaut, one with two, one with three) compared to 16 by the United States. In terms of spacecraft hours, the USSR had 460 hours of spaceflight; the United States had 1,024 hours. In terms of astronaut/cosmonaut time, the USSR had 534 hours of crewed spaceflight whereas the United States had 1,992 hours. By the time of Apollo 11, the United States had a lead much wider than that. (See List of human spaceflights, 1961–1970, and refer to individual flights for the length of time.)

Moreover, the USSR did not develop a successful rocket capable of a crewed lunar mission until the 1980s – their N1 rocket failed on all four launch attempts between 1969 and 1972. The Soviet LK lunar lander was tested in uncrewed low-Earth-orbit flights three times in 1970 and 1971.

=== Technology used by NASA ===
Digital technology was in its infancy during the time of the Moon landings. The astronauts had relied on computers to aid in the Moon missions. The Apollo Guidance Computer was on the Lunar Module and the command and service module. Many computers at the time were very large despite poor specs. For example, the Xerox Alto was released in 1973, one year after the final Moon landing. This computer had 96kB of memory. Most personal computers as of 2019 use 50,000 to 100,000 times this amount of RAM. Conspiracy theorists claim that the computers during the time of the Moon landings would not have been advanced enough to enable space travel to the Moon and back; they similarly claim that other contemporaneous technology (radio transmission, radar, and other instrumentation) was likewise insufficient for the task.

=== Deaths of NASA personnel ===
In a televised program about the Moon-landing hoax allegations, Fox Entertainment Group listed the deaths of ten astronauts and two civilians related to the crewed spaceflight program as part of an alleged cover-up.
* Theodore Freeman (killed ejecting from a T-38 which had suffered a bird strike, October 1964)
* Elliot See and Charlie Bassett (T-38 crash in bad weather, February 1966)
* Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom, Ed White, and Roger B. Chaffee (killed in a fire during the &quot;plugs-out test&quot; preceding Apollo 1, January 1967)
* Edward &quot;Ed&quot; Givens (killed in a car accident, June 1967)
* Clifton &quot;C. C.&quot; Williams (killed ejecting from a T-38, October 1967)
* Michael J. &quot;Mike&quot; Adams (died in an X-15 crash, November 1967. Adams was the only pilot killed during the X-15 flight test program. He was a test pilot, not a NASA astronaut, but had flown the X-15 above )
* Robert Henry Lawrence Jr. (killed in an F-104 crash, December 1967, shortly after being selected as a pilot with the United States Air Force&#x27;s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program, which was canceled in 1969)
* Thomas Ronald Baron (North American Aviation employee. Baron died in an automobile collision with a train, April 27, 1967, six days after testifying before Rep. Olin E. Teague&#x27;s House Subcommittee on NASA Oversight hearings held following the Apollo 1 fire, after which he was fired)

Two of the above, X-15 pilot Mike Adams and MOL pilot Robert Lawrence, had no connection with the civilian crewed space program that oversaw the Apollo missions. Baron was a quality control inspector who wrote a report critical of the Apollo program and was an outspoken critic of NASA&#x27;s safety record after the Apollo 1 fire. Baron and his family were killed as their car was struck by a train at a train crossing. The deaths were an accident. All of the deaths occurred at least 20 months &quot;before&quot; Apollo 11 and subsequent flights.

, four of the twelve Apollo astronauts who landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972 are still alive, including Buzz Aldrin. Also, two of the twelve Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing between 1968 and 1972 are still alive.

The number of deaths within the American astronaut corps during the run-up to Apollo and during the Apollo missions is similar to the number of deaths incurred by the Soviets. During the period 1961 to 1972, at least eight Soviet serving and former cosmonauts died:
* Valentin Bondarenko (ground training accident, March 1961)
* Grigori Nelyubov (suicide, February 1966)
* Vladimir Komarov (Soyuz 1 accident, April 1967)
* Yuri Gagarin (MiG-15 crash, March 1968)
* Pavel Belyayev (complications following surgery, January 1970)
* Georgi Dobrovolski, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev (Soyuz 11 accident, June 1971)

Additionally, the overall chief of their crewed-spaceflight program, Sergei Korolev, died while undergoing surgery in January 1966.

===Post flight conference===
During the post flight conference for Apollo 11, there were moments in which the astronauts appeared serious or tired in a press conference otherwise filled with laughter. Conspiracy theorists often present images of those moments and portray it as the astronauts feeling guilty about faking the landing. This supposed evidence can be explained as a case of cherry picking and an appeal to emotion.

=== NASA response ===
In June 1977, NASA issued a fact sheet responding to recent claims that the Apollo Moon landings had been hoaxed. The fact sheet is particularly blunt and regards the idea of faking the Moon landings to be preposterous and outlandish. NASA refers to the rocks and particles collected from the Moon as being evidence of the program&#x27;s legitimacy, as they claim that these rocks could not have been formed under conditions on Earth. NASA also notes that all of the operations and phases of the Apollo program were closely followed and under the scrutiny of the news media, from liftoff to splashdown. NASA responds to Bill Kaysing&#x27;s book, &quot;We Never Went to the Moon&quot;, by identifying one of his claims of fraud regarding the lack of a crater left on the Moon&#x27;s surface by the landing of the lunar module, and refuting it with facts about the soil and cohesive nature of the surface of the Moon.

The fact sheet was reissued on February 14, 2001, the day before Fox television&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?&quot; The documentary reinvigorated the public&#x27;s interest in conspiracy theories and the possibility that the Moon landings were faked, which has provoked NASA to once again defend its name.

=== Alleged Stanley Kubrick involvement ===

Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick is accused of having produced much of the footage for Apollos 11 and 12, presumably because he had just directed &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, which is partly set on the Moon and featured advanced special effects. It has been claimed that when &quot;2001&quot; was in post-production in early 1968, NASA secretly approached Kubrick to direct the first three Moon landings. The launch and splashdown would be real but the spacecraft would stay in Earth orbit and fake footage broadcast as &quot;live from the Moon.&quot; No evidence was offered for this theory, which overlooks many facts. For example, &quot;2001&quot; was released before the first Apollo landing and Kubrick&#x27;s depiction of the Moon&#x27;s surface differs greatly from its appearance in the Apollo footage. The movement of characters on the Moon in &quot;2001&quot; differs from that of the filmed movement of Apollo astronauts and does not resemble an environment with 1/6 the gravity of Earth. Several scenes in &quot;2001&quot; show dust billowing as spacecraft landed, something that would not happen in the vacuum environment of the Moon. Kubrick did hire Frederick Ordway and Harry Lange, both of whom had worked for NASA and major aerospace contractors, to work with him on &quot;2001&quot;. Kubrick also used some 50 mm f/0.7 lenses that were left over from a batch made by Zeiss for NASA. However, Kubrick only got this lens for &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975). The lens was originally a still photo lens and needed changes to be used for motion filming.

The mockumentary based on this idea, &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, could have fueled the conspiracy theory. This French mockumentary, directed by William Karel, was originally aired on Arte channel in 2002 with the title &quot;Opération Lune&quot;. It parodies conspiracy theories with faked interviews, stories of assassinations of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s assistants by the CIA, and a variety of conspicuous mistakes, puns, and references to old movie characters, inserted through the film as clues for the viewer. Nevertheless, &quot;Opération Lune&quot; is still taken at face value by some conspiracy believers.

An article titled &quot;Stanley Kubrick and the Moon Hoax&quot; appeared on Usenet in 1995, in the newsgroup &quot;alt.humor.best-of-usenet&quot;. One passage – on how Kubrick was supposedly coerced into the conspiracy – reads:

NASA further leveraged their position by threatening to publicly reveal the heavy involvement of Mr. Kubrick&#x27;s younger brother, Raul, with the American Communist Party. This would have been an intolerable embarrassment to Mr. Kubrick, especially since the release of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;.

Kubrick had no such brother – the article was a spoof, complete with a giveaway sentence describing Kubrick shooting the moonwalk &quot;on location&quot; on the Moon. Nevertheless, the claim was taken up in earnest; Clyde Lewis used it almost word-for-word, whereas Jay Weidner gave the brother a more senior status within the party:

No one knows how the powers-that-be convinced Kubrick to direct the Apollo landings. Maybe they had compromised Kubrick in some way. The fact that his brother, Raul Kubrick, was the head of the American Communist Party may have been one of the avenues pursued by the government to get Stanley to cooperate.

In July 2009, Weidner posted on his webpage &quot;Secrets of the Shining&quot;, where he states that Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980) is a veiled confession of his role in the scam project. This thesis was the subject of refutation in an article published on Seeker nearly half a year later.

The 2015 movie &quot;Moonwalkers&quot; is a fictional account of a CIA agent&#x27;s claim of Kubrick&#x27;s involvement.

In December 2015, a video surfaced which allegedly shows Kubrick being interviewed shortly before his 1999 death; the video purportedly shows the director confessing to T. Patrick Murray that the Apollo Moon landings had been faked. Research quickly found, however, that the video was a hoax.

=== Academic work ===
In 2002, NASA granted $15,000 to James Oberg to write a point-by-point rebuttal of the hoax claims. However, NASA canceled the commission later that year, after complaints that the book would dignify the accusations. Oberg said that he meant to finish the book. In November 2002, Peter Jennings said that &quot;NASA is going to spend a few thousand dollars trying to prove to some people that the United States did indeed land men on the Moon&quot;, and &quot;NASA had been so rattled&quot; that they hired somebody to write a book refuting the conspiracy theorists. Oberg says that belief in the hoax theories is not the fault of the conspiracists, but rather that of teachers and people who should provide information to the public—especially NASA.

In 2004, Martin Hendry and Ken Skeldon of the University of Glasgow were awarded a grant by the UK-based Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council to investigate Moon landing conspiracy theories. In November 2004, they gave a lecture at the Glasgow Science Centre where the top ten claims by conspiracists were individually addressed and refuted.

=== &quot;MythBusters&quot; special ===
An episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot; in August 2008 was dedicated to the Moon landings. The &quot;MythBusters&quot; crew tested many of the conspiracists&#x27; claims. Some of the testings were done in a NASA training facility. All of the conspiracists&#x27; claims examined on the show were labeled as having been &quot;Busted&quot;, or disproved.

== Third-party evidence of Moon landings ==
=== Imaging the landing sites ===

Moon-landing conspiracists claim that observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope should be able to photograph the landing sites. This implies that the world&#x27;s major observatories (as well as the Hubble Program) are complicit in the hoax by refusing to take photos of the landing sites. Photos of the Moon have been taken by Hubble, including at least two Apollo landing sites, but the Hubble resolution limits viewing of lunar objects to sizes no smaller than , which is insufficient resolution to see any landing site features.

In April 2001, Leonard David published an article on space.com, which showed a photo taken by the Clementine mission showing a diffuse dark spot at the site NASA says is the Apollo 15 lander. The evidence was noticed by Misha Kreslavsky, of the Department of Geological Sciences at Brown University, and Yuri Shkuratov of the Kharkiv Astronomical Observatory in Ukraine. The European Space Agency&#x27;s SMART-1 uncrewed probe sent back photos of the landing sites, according to Bernard Foing, Chief Scientist of the ESA Science Program. &quot;Given SMART-1&#x27;s initial high orbit, however, it may prove difficult to see artifacts,&quot; said Foing in an interview on space.com.

In 2002, Alex R. Blackwell of the University of Hawaii pointed out that some photos taken by Apollo astronauts while in orbit around the Moon show the landing sites.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; published a story in 2002 saying that European astronomers at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) would use it to view the landing sites. According to the article, Dr. Richard West said that his team would take &quot;a high-resolution image of one of the Apollo landing sites.&quot; Marcus Allen, a conspiracist, answered that no photos of hardware on the Moon would convince him that human landings had happened. The telescope was used to image the Moon and provided a resolution of , which was not good enough to resolve the wide lunar landers or their long shadows.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched their SELENE Moon orbiter on September 14, 2007 (JST), from Tanegashima Space Center. SELENE orbited the Moon at about altitude. In May 2008, JAXA reported detecting the &quot;halo&quot; generated by the Apollo 15 Lunar Module engine exhaust from a Terrain Camera image. A three-dimensional reconstructed photo also matched the terrain of an Apollo 15 photo taken from the surface.

On July 17, 2009, NASA released low-resolution engineering test photos of the Apollo 11, Apollo 14, Apollo 15, Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 landing sites that have been photographed by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter as part of the process of starting its primary mission. The photos show the descent stage of the landers from each mission on the Moon&#x27;s surface. The photo of the Apollo 14 landing site also shows tracks made by an astronaut between a science experiment (ALSEP) and the lander. Photos of the Apollo 12 landing site were released by NASA on September 3, 2009. The &quot;Intrepid&quot; lander descent stage, experiment package (ALSEP), Surveyor 3 spacecraft, and astronaut footpaths are all visible. While the LRO images have been enjoyed by the scientific community as a whole, they have not done anything to convince conspiracists that the landings happened.

On September 1, 2009, India&#x27;s lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 took photos of the Apollo 15 landing site and tracks of the lunar rovers. The Indian Space Research Organisation launched their uncrewed lunar probe on September 8, 2008 (IST), from Satish Dhawan Space Centre. The photos were taken by a hyperspectral camera fitted as part of the mission&#x27;s image payload.

China&#x27;s second lunar probe, Chang&#x27;e 2, which was launched in 2010, can photograph the lunar surface with a resolution of up to . It spotted traces of the Apollo landings.

=== Moon rocks ===
The Apollo program collected of Moon rocks during the six crewed missions. Analyses by scientists worldwide all agree that these rocks came from the Moon – no published accounts in peer-reviewed scientific journals exist that dispute this claim. The Apollo samples are easily distinguishable from both meteorites and Earth rocks in that they show a lack of hydrous alteration products, they show evidence of having undergone impact events on an airless body, and they have unique geochemical traits. Furthermore, most are more than 200 million years older than the oldest Earth rocks. The Moon rocks also share the same traits as Soviet samples.

Conspiracists argue that Marshall Space Flight Center Director Wernher von Braun&#x27;s trip to Antarctica in 1967 (about two years before the Apollo 11 launch) was to gather lunar meteorites to be used as fake Moon rocks. Because von Braun was a former SS officer (though one who had been detained by the Gestapo), the documentary film &quot;Did We Go?&quot; suggests that he could have been pressured to agree to the conspiracy to protect himself from recriminations over his past. NASA said that von Braun&#x27;s mission was &quot;to look into environmental and logistic factors that might relate to the planning of future space missions, and hardware.&quot;

It is now accepted by the scientific community that rocks have been blasted from both the Martian and lunar surface during impact events, and that some of these have landed on the Earth as meteorites. However, the first Antarctic lunar meteorite was found in 1979, and its lunar origin was not recognized until 1982. Furthermore, lunar meteorites are so rare that it is unlikely that they could account for the of Moon rocks that NASA gathered between 1969 and 1972. Only about of lunar meteorites have been found on Earth thus far, despite private collectors and governmental agencies worldwide searching for more than 20 years.

While the Apollo missions gathered of Moon rocks, the Soviet Luna 16, Luna 20 and Luna 24 robots gathered only combined (that is, less than one-thousandth as much). Indeed, current plans for a Martian sample return would only gather about of soil, and a recently proposed South Pole-Aitken basin robot mission would only gather about of Moon rock.

On the makeup of the Moon rocks, Kaysing asked: &quot;Why was there never a mention of gold, silver, diamonds or other precious metals on the moon? Wasn&#x27;t this a viable consideration? Why was this fact never dicussed [&quot;sic&quot;] in the press or by the astronauts?&quot;

=== Missions tracked by independent parties ===

Aside from NASA, a number of groups and individuals tracked the Apollo missions as they happened. On later missions, NASA released information to the public explaining where and when the spacecraft could be sighted. Their flight paths were tracked using radar and they were sighted and photographed using telescopes. Also, radio transmissions between the astronauts on the surface and in orbit were independently recorded.

=== Retroreflectors ===
The presence of retroreflectors (mirrors used as targets for Earth-based tracking lasers) from the Laser Ranging Retroreflector Experiment (LRRR) is evidence that there were landings. Lick Observatory attempted to detect from Apollo 11&#x27;s retroreflector while Armstrong and Aldrin were still on the Moon but did not succeed until August 1, 1969. The Apollo 14 astronauts deployed a retroreflector on February 5, 1971, and McDonald Observatory detected it the same day. The Apollo 15 retroreflector was deployed on July 31, 1971, and was detected by McDonald Observatory within a few days. Smaller retroreflectors were also put on the Moon by the Russians; they were attached to the uncrewed lunar rovers Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2.

== Public opinion ==
In a 1994 poll by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, 9% of the respondents said that it was possible that astronauts did not go to the Moon and another 5% were unsure. A 1999 Gallup Poll found that 6% of the Americans surveyed doubted that the Moon landings happened and that 5% of those surveyed had no opinion, which roughly matches the findings of a similar 1995 &quot;Time/CNN&quot; poll. Officials of the Fox network said that such skepticism rose to about 20% after the February 2001 airing of their network&#x27;s television special, &quot;Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?&quot;, seen by about 15 million viewers. This Fox special is seen as having promoted the hoax claims.

A 2000 poll conducted by the (&quot;ФОМ&quot;) in Russia found that 28% of those surveyed did not believe that American astronauts landed on the Moon, and this percentage is roughly equal in all social-demographic groups. In 2009, a poll held by the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;Engineering &amp; Technology&quot; magazine found that 25% of those surveyed did not believe that men landed on the Moon. Another poll gives that 25% of 18- to 25-year-olds surveyed were unsure that the landings happened.

There are subcultures worldwide which advocate the belief that the Moon landings were faked. By 1977 the Hare Krishna magazine &quot;Back to Godhead&quot; called the landings a hoax, claiming that, since the Sun is away, and &quot;according to Hindu mythology the Moon is farther away than that&quot;, the Moon would be nearly away; to travel that span in 91 hours would require a speed of more than a million miles per hour, &quot;a patently impossible feat even by the scientists&#x27; calculations.&quot;

James Oberg of ABC News said that the conspiracy theory is taught in many Cuban schools, both in Cuba and where Cuban teachers are loaned. A poll conducted in the 1970s by the United States Information Agency in several countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa found that most respondents were unaware of the Moon landings, many of the others dismissed them as propaganda or science fiction, and many thought that it had been the Russians that landed on the Moon.

In 2019, Ipsos conducted a study for C-SPAN to assess the level of belief that the 1969 Moon landing was faked. Six percent of respondents believed it was not real, but eleven percent of millennials (reached adulthood in the early 21st century) were the most likely to believe it was not factual.

<doc id="80749" wikidata="Q37731" url="?curid=80749" title="Uthman">
<text>Uthman ibn Affan (; 17 June 656) was the third caliph, ruling from 644 until his assassination in 656. Uthman, a second cousin, son-in-law, and notable companion of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, played a major role in early Islamic history. During his reign as caliph, he was known for ordering the official compilation of the standardized version of the Quran that is still being used today.

Before his predecessor, Caliph Umar (), died in office, he appointed a committee of trustees to elect a successor. Uthman, who was then aged 68–71 years, was elected to succeed him and became the oldest person to hold such a high position. During his premiership, the Caliphate expanded further into Persia in 650 and reached as far as the provinces of Khorasan in 651. Uthman instituted centralized reforms in order to create a more cohesive administrative structure and fostered rapid economic growth.

However, the last years of his reign were marked by discontent that eventually evolved into an armed revolt, leading to a siege upon his residence and ultimately culminating in his assassination. Sunni Muslim tradition considers him the third rightly-guided caliph.

==Family and early life==

Uthman was born in the Hejaz. The exact date is disputed, both 573 and 576 are indicated. He was born to an affluent family of the noble Umayyad clan. His father, Affan ibn Abi al-As was of the Umayyad, and his mother, Arwa bint Kurayz was of the Abdshams, which were both powerful and wealthy clans in Mecca. Uthman had one sister, Amina.

Uthman is related to Muhammad through his mother, who was the first cousin of Muhammad and made Uthman his first cousin&#x27;s son.

His father died at a young age while on a caravan travel, leaving Uthman with a large inheritance. He brilliantly invested the wealth in trade and became a highly successful merchant, making him one the wealthiest people from the Quraysh.

== Companionship of Muhammad ==
=== Conversion to Islam ===
On returning from a business trip to Syria in 611, Uthman learned of Muhammad&#x27;s declared mission. After a discussion with Abu Bakr, Uthman decided to convert to Islam, and Abu Bakr brought him to Muhammad to declare his faith. Uthman thus became one of the earliest converts to Islam, following Ali, Zayd, Abu Bakr and a few others. His conversion to Islam angered his uncle who strongly opposed Muhammad&#x27;s teachings. He is listed as one of the twenty two Meccans at the dawn of Islam who knew how to write.

=== Migration to Abyssinia ===
Uthman and his wife, Ruqayya, migrated to Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) in April 615, along with ten Muslim men and three women. Scores of Muslims joined them later. As Uthman already had some business contacts in Abyssinia, he continued to practice his profession as a trader and he continued to flourish.

After four years, the news spread among the Muslims in Abyssinia that the Quraysh of Mecca had accepted Islam, and this acceptance persuaded Uthman, Ruqayya and 39 Muslims to return. However, when they reached Mecca, they found that the news about the Quraysh&#x27;s acceptance of Islam was false. Nevertheless, Uthman and Ruqayya re-settled in Mecca. Uthman had to start his business afresh, but the contacts that he had already established in Abyssinia worked in his favour and his business prospered once again.

=== Migration to Medina ===
In 622, Uthman and his wife, Ruqayya, were among the third group of Muslims to migrate to Medina. Upon arrival, Uthman stayed with Abu Talha ibn Thabit before moving into the house he purchased a short time later. Uthman was one of the richest merchants of Mecca, with no need of financial help from his Ansari brothers, as he had brought the considerable fortune he had amassed with him to Medina. Most Muslims of Medina were farmers with little interest in trade, and Jews had conducted most trading in the town. Uthman realized there was a considerable commercial opportunity to promote trade among Muslims and soon established himself as a trader in Medina. With hard work and honesty, his business flourished, making him one of the richest men in Medina. Both of Uthman&#x27;s wives having been elder daughters of Muhammad and Khadija earned him the honorific title &quot;Dhū al-Nurayn&quot; (&quot;The Possessor of Two Lights&quot;).

Across the Muslim world, Uthman is known by his honorific title &quot;Ghani&quot; that translates to &quot;exceedingly generous&quot; which was bestowed upon him for his remarkable donations towards helping those in need and for the cause of Islam.

=== Life in Medina ===
When Ali married Fatima, Uthman bought Ali&#x27;s shield for five hundred dirhams. Four hundred was set aside as &quot;mahr&quot; (dower) for Fatimah&#x27;s marriage, leaving a hundred for all other expenses. Later, Uthman presented the armour back to Ali as a wedding present.

=== Battles ===

Uthman participated in all major battles which took place in the early period of Islam except for Badr and that too because the Prophet of Islam commanded him to stay back and tend to his wife who was unwell at the time. Regarding this, there is a hadith which states, &quot;You (Uthman) will have the reward and the share of booty of a man who was present at Badr&quot;.

Furthermore, during the campaigns of Ghatafan and Dhat al-Riqa the Prophet of Islam left Uthman in charge of Madinah when the Muslim army ventured out of the city.

=== Muhammad&#x27;s last years ===

In 632, the year Muhammad died, Uthman participated in the Farewell Pilgrimage. Uthman was also present at the event of Ghadir Khumm, where, according to Shia sources, he was among those who pledged allegiance to Ali.

== Caliph Abu Bakr&#x27;s era (632–634) ==
Uthman had a very close relationship with Abu Bakr, as it was due to him that Uthman had converted to Islam. When Abu Bakr was selected as the caliph, Uthman was the first person after Umar to offer his allegiance. During the Ridda wars (Wars of Apostasy), Uthman remained in Medina, acting as Abu Bakr&#x27;s adviser. On his deathbed, Abu Bakr dictated his will to Uthman, saying that his successor was to be Umar.

== Election of Uthman ==


Umar, on his deathbed formed a committee of six people, all from the Muhajirun (early Meccan converts), to choose the next caliph from amongst themselves. This committee was:
* Ali
* Uthman ibn Affan
* Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf
* Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas
* Zubayr ibn al-Awwam
* Talha ibn Ubayd Allah

According to Yaqoubi history, Umar appointed Abu Talha Ansari to this task and said: If four people gave an opinion and two disagreed, behead those two, and if three agreed and three disagreed, the three people whom Abd al-Rahman is not among them, behead them, and if three days passed and they didn&#x27;t reach an agreement on anyone, behead them all&quot;.

Yaqoubi further adds that many negotiations took place in these three days and the result was hesitant between Ali and Uthman. Abd al-Rahman asked Ali: If we pledge allegiance to you, would you be willing to follow the Book of God (Quran) and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah and behave in the manner of the two previous caliphs (Umar and Abu Bakr)? Ali&#x27;s answer to Abd al-Rahman was: I will only follow the Book of God and the Sunnah of the Messenger of God. Abd al-Rahman asked the same question to Uthman and Uthman answered positively and accepted all the conditions and therefore he became the caliph.

== Caliphate ==
In about AD 650, Uthman began noticing slight differences in recitations of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd ibn Thabit to use caliph Abu Bakr&#x27;s copy and prepare a standardised version of the Quran. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad&#x27;s death, the Quran was committed to written form. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, with the other versions ordered to be burnt by Uthman.

While the Shī‘ah use the same Qur&#x27;an as Sunni Muslims, they do not believe that it was first compiled by Uthman. Rather, the Shī‘ah believe that the Qur&#x27;an was gathered and compiled by Muhammad during his lifetime.

=== Economic and social administration ===
Uthman was a shrewd businessman and a successful trader from his youth, which contributed greatly to the Rashidun Caliphate. Umar had established a public allowance and, on assuming office, Uthman increased it by about 25%. Umar had placed a ban on the sale of lands and the purchase of agricultural lands in conquered territories. Uthman withdrew these restrictions, as the trade could not flourish. Uthman also permitted people to draw loans from the public treasury. Under Umar, it had been laid down as a policy that the lands in conquered territories were not to be distributed among the combatants, but were to remain the property of the previous owners. The army felt dissatisfied at this decision, but Umar suppressed the opposition with a strong hand. Uthman followed the policy devised by Umar and there were more conquests, and the revenues from land increased considerably.

Umar had been very strict in the use of money from the public treasury—indeed, apart from the meagre allowance that had been sanctioned in his favour, Umar took no money from the treasury. He did not receive any gifts, nor did he allow any of his family members to accept any gifts from any quarter. During the time of Uthman, these restrictions were relaxed. Although Uthman still drew no personal allowance from the treasury, nor did he receive a salary, as he was a wealthy man with sufficient resources of his own, but, unlike Umar, Uthman accepted gifts and allowed his family members to do likewise from certain quarters. Uthman honestly expressed that he had the right to utilize the public funds according to his best judgment, and no one criticized him for that. The economic reforms introduced by Uthman had far-reaching effects; Muslims, as well as non-Muslims of the Rashidun Caliphate, enjoyed an economically prosperous life during his reign.

=== Military expansion ===

During his rule, Uthman&#x27;s military-style was more autonomical in nature as he delegated much military authority to his trusted kinsmen—e.g., Abd Allah ibn Amir, Mu&#x27;awiya I and Abd Allah ibn Sa&#x27;d—unlike Umar&#x27;s more centralized policy. Consequently, this more independent policy allowed more expansion until Sindh, in modern Pakistan, which had not been touched during the tenure of Umar. The conquest of Armenia had begun by the 640s.

Muawiyah I had been appointed the governor of Syria by Umar in 639 to stop Byzantine harassment from the sea during the Arab-Byzantine Wars. He succeeded his elder brother Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, who died in a plague, along with Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, the governor before him, and 25,000 other people. Now under Uthman&#x27;s rule in 649, Muawiyah was allowed to set up a navy, manned by Monophysitic Christians, Copts, and Jacobite Syrian Christian sailors and Muslim troops, which defeated the Byzantine navy at the Battle of the Masts in 655, opening up the Mediterranean.

In Hijri year 15 (c. 647), Uthman sent Abdullah ibn Zubayr and Abdullah ibn Saad to reconquer the Maghreb, where he met the army of Gregory the Patrician, Exarch of Africa and relative of Heraclius, which is recorded to have numbered between 120,000 and 200,000 soldiers, The opposing forces clashed at Sabuthilag (or Sufetula), which became the name of this battle. Records from al-Bidayah wal Nihayah state that Abdullah&#x27;s troops were completely surrounded by Gregory&#x27;s army. However, Abdullah ibn Zubayr spotted Gregory in his chariot and asked Abdullah ibn Sa&#x27;ad to lead a small detachment to intercept him. The interception was successful, and Gregory was slain by Zubayr&#x27;s ambush party. Consequently, the morale of Byzantine army started crumbling and soon they were routed.

Some Muslim sources (Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari) claim that after the conquest of northern Africa was completed, Abdullah ibn Sa&#x27;d continued to Spain. Other prominent Muslim historians, like Ibn Kathir, have quoted the same narration. In the description of this campaign, two of Abdullah ibn Saad&#x27;s generals, Abdullah ibn Nafiah ibn Husain, and Abdullah ibn Nafi&#x27; ibn Abdul Qais, were ordered to invade the coastal areas of Spain by sea, aided by a Berber force. They allegedly succeeded in conquering the coastal areas of Al-Andalus. It is not known where the Muslim force landed, what resistance they met, and what parts of Spain they actually conquered. However, it is clear that the Muslims did conquer some portion of Spain during the caliphate of Uthman, presumably establishing colonies on its coast. On this occasion, Uthman is reported to have addressed a letter to the invading force:

Although raids by Berbers and Muslims were conducted against the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain during the late 7th century, there is no evidence that Spain was invaded nor that parts of it were conquered or settled by Muslims prior to the 711 campaign by Tariq.

Abdullah ibn Saad also achieved success in the Caliphate&#x27;s first decisive naval battle against the Byzantine Empire, the Battle of the Masts.
To the east, Ahnaf ibn Qais, chief of Banu Tamim and a veteran commander who conquered Shustar earlier, launched a series of further military expansions by further mauling Yazdegerd III near Oxus River in Turkmenistan and later crushing a military coalition of Sassanid loyalists and Hephthalite Empire in the Siege of Herat. Later, the governor of Basra, Abdullah ibn Aamir also led a number of successful campaigns, ranging from the suppression of revolts in Fars, Kerman, Sistan, and Khorasan, to the opening of new fronts for conquest in Transoxiana and Afghanistan.

In the next year, AD 652, Futh Al-Buldan of Baladhuri writes that Balochistan was re-conquered during the campaign against the revolt in Kermān, under the command of Majasha ibn Mas&#x27;ud. It was the first time that western Balochistan had come directly under the laws of the Caliphate and it paid an agricultural tribute.

The military campaigns under Uthman&#x27;s rule were generally successful, except for a few in the Nubia, on the lower Nile.

=== Public opposition to Uthman&#x27;s policies ===
==== Reasons for the opposition ====
Noting an increase in anti-government tension around the Caliphate, Uthman&#x27;s administration decided to determine its origins, extent, and aims. Some time around 654, Uthman called all twelve provincial governors to Medina to discuss the problem. During this Council of Governors, Uthman ordered that all resolutions of the council be adopted according to local circumstances. Later, in the Majlis al Shurah (council of ministers), it was suggested to Uthman that reliable agents be sent to various provinces to attempt to determine the source of the discontent. Uthman accordingly sent Muhammad ibn Maslamah to Kufa, Usama ibn Zayd to Basra, Ammar ibn Yasir to Egypt, and Abdullah ibn Umar to Syria. The agents sent to Kufa, Basra and Syria reported that all was well—the people were generally satisfied with the administration, although some individuals had minor personal grievances. Ammar ibn Yasir, the emissary to Egypt, however, did not return to Medina. Rebels there had been issuing propaganda in favour of making Ali caliph. Ammar ibn Yasir, who had been affiliated with Ali, abandoned Uthman for the Egyptian opposition. Abdullah ibn Saad, the governor of Egypt, reported about the opposition&#x27;s activities instead. He wanted to take action against Ali&#x27;s foster son, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, Muhammad bin Abi Hudhaifa, Uthman&#x27;s adopted son, and Ammar ibn Yasir.

==== Uthman&#x27;s attempts to appease the dissidents ====
In 655, Uthman directed those with any grievance against the administration, as well as the governors and &quot;Amils&quot; throughout the caliphate, to assemble at Mecca for the Hajj, promising that all legitimate grievances would be redressed. Accordingly, large delegations from various cities came to present their grievances before the gathering.

The rebels realized that the people in Mecca supported Uthman and were not inclined to listen to them. This represented a great psychological victory for Uthman. It is said, according to Sunni Muslim accounts, that before returning to Syria, the governor Muawiyah, Uthman&#x27;s cousin, suggested that Uthman should come with him to Syria as the atmosphere there was peaceful. Uthman rejected his offer, saying that he did not want to leave the city of Muhammad (&quot;viz.&quot;, Medina). Muawiyah then suggested that he be allowed to send a strong force from Syria to Medina to guard Uthman against any possible attempt by rebels to harm him. Uthman rejected it too, saying that the Syrian forces in Medina would be an incitement to civil war, and he could not be party to such a move.

== Revolt against Uthman ==
The politics of Egypt played the major role in the propaganda war against the caliphate, so Uthman summoned Abdullah ibn Saad, the governor of Egypt, to Medina to consult with him as to the course of action that should be adopted. Abdullah ibn Saad came to Medina, leaving the affairs of Egypt to his deputy, and in his absence, Muhammad bin Abi Hudhaifa staged a coup d&#x27;état and took power. On hearing of the revolt in Egypt, Abdullah hastened back, but Uthman was not in a position to offer him any military assistance, and so Abdullah was unable to suppress the revolt.

Several Sunni scholars, such as Ibn Qutaybah, Ali Ibn Burhanuddin al-Halabi, Ibne Abi-al-Hadeed and Ibne Manzur, reported that there were several leading Sahaba among those who called upon Uthman to step down for reasons such as nepotism and profligacy.

=== Rebels in Medina ===
From Egypt, Kufa, and Basra, contingents of about 1,000 people apiece were sent to Medina, each with instructions to assassinate Uthman and overthrow the government. Representatives of the Egyptian contingent waited on Ali, and offered him the Caliphate, but he turned them down. Representatives of the contingent from Kufa waited on Al-Zubayr, and those from Basra waited on Talha, each offering them their allegiance as the next Caliph, but both were similarly turned down. By proposing alternatives to Uthman as Caliph, the rebels swayed public opinion in Medina to the point where Uthman&#x27;s faction could no longer offer a united front. Uthman had the active support of the Umayyads, and a few other people in Medina.

=== Siege of Uthman ===
The early stage of the siege of Uthman&#x27;s house was not severe, but, as the days passed, the rebels intensified the pressure against Uthman. With the departure of the pilgrims from Medina to Mecca, the rebel position was strengthened further, and as a consequence the crisis deepened. The rebels understood that, after the Hajj, the Muslims, gathered at Mecca from all parts of the Muslim world, might march to Medina to relieve Uthman. They therefore decided to take action against Uthman before the pilgrimage was over. During the siege, Uthman was asked by his supporters, who outnumbered the rebels, to let them fight, but Uthman refused, in an effort to avoid bloodshed among Muslims. Unfortunately for Uthman, violence still occurred. The gates of the house of Uthman were shut and guarded by the warrior Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr, along with Ali&#x27;s sons, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali.

=== Causes of anti-Uthman revolt ===
The actual reason for the anti-Uthman movement is disputed among the Shia and Sunni Muslims. Under Uthman, the people became more prosperous and on the political plane they came to enjoy a larger degree of freedom. No institutions were devised to channel political activity, and, in their absence, the pre-Islamic tribal jealousies and rivalries, which had been suppressed under earlier caliphs, erupted once again. The people took advantage of Uthman&#x27;s leniency, which became a headache for the state, culminating in Uthman&#x27;s assassination.

According to Wilferd Madelung, during Uthman&#x27;s reign, &quot;grievances against his arbitrary acts were substantial by standards of his time. Historical sources mention a lengthy account of the wrongdoings he was accused of... It was only his violent death that came to absolve him in Sunni ideology from any &quot;ahdath&quot; and make him a martyr and the third Rightly Guided Caliph.&quot; According to Keaney Heather, Uthman, as a caliph, relied solely on his own volition in picking his cabinet, which led to decisions that bred resistance within the Muslim community. Indeed, his style of governance made Uthman one of the most controversial figures in Islamic history.

The resistance against Uthman arose because he favoured family members when choosing governors, reasoning that, by doing this, he would be able to exact more influence on how the caliphate was run and consequently improve the feudal system he worked to establish. The contrary turned out to be true and his appointees had more control over how he conducted business than he had originally planned. They went so far as to impose authoritarianism over their provinces. Indeed, many anonymous letters were written to the leading companions of Muhammad, complaining about the alleged tyranny of Uthman&#x27;s appointed governors. Moreover, letters were sent to the leaders of public opinion in different provinces concerning the reported mishandling of power by Uthman&#x27;s family. This contributed to unrest in the empire and finally Uthman had to investigate the matter in an attempt to ascertain the authenticity of the rumours. Wilferd Madelung discredits the alleged role of Abdullah ibn Saba in the rebellion against Uthman and observes that &quot;few if any modern historians would accept Sayf&#x27;s legend of Ibn Saba&quot;.

Bernard Lewis, a 20th-century scholar, says of Uthman:

== Assassination ==

On 17 June 656, rebels found the gate of Uthman&#x27;s house strongly guarded by his supporters. Some of the rebels, scaled the neighboring houses and jumped into Uthman&#x27;s. Then one rebel approached Uthman, grabbed and shook his beard. Uthman prayed to God for protection from killing, the rebel stabbed him in the head, and the other rebels followed suit.

According to a narration regarded as likely to be a legend by Madelung, Uthman&#x27;s wives threw themselves on his body to shield him. Na’ila, one of his wives, extended her hand to block a blade. Her fingers were severed, and she was shoved aside. The following strike killed Uthman. A few of Uthman&#x27;s slaves retaliated, and one of them succeeded in killing one of the assassins before being murdered by the rebels.

=== Funeral ===
After the body of Uthman had been in the house for three days, Na&#x27;ila approached some of his supporters to assist in his burial, but only about a dozen people responded, including Marwan, Zayd ibn Thabit, &#x27;Huwatib bin Alfarah, Jubayr ibn Mut&#x27;im, Abu Jahm bin Hudaifa, Hakim bin Hazam and Niyar bin Mukarram. The body was lifted at dusk, and because of the blockade, no coffin could be procured. The body was not washed. Thus, Uthman was carried to the graveyard in the clothes that he was wearing at the time of his assassination.

Na&#x27;ila followed the funeral with a lamp, but, in order to maintain secrecy, the lamp had to be extinguished. Na&#x27;ila was accompanied by some women, including Uthman&#x27;s daughter.

=== Burial ===
The body was carried to Jannat al-Baqi for burial. Apparently, some people gathered there, and resisted Uthman&#x27;s burial in the Muslim cemetery. Accordingly, Uthman&#x27;s supporters later buried him in the Jewish graveyard behind Jannat al-Baqi. Some decades later, the Umayyad rulers demolished the wall separating the two cemeteries and merged the Jewish cemetery into the Muslim one to ensure that his tomb was now inside a Muslim cemetery.

The funeral prayers were led by Jubayr ibn Mut&#x27;im, and the dead body was lowered into the grave with little ceremony. After burial, Na&#x27;ila and A&#x27;isha wanted to speak, but were discouraged from doing so due to possible danger from the rioters.

== Appearance and character ==
The historian al-Tabari notes that Uthman was of medium height, strong-boned and broad-shouldered, and walked in a bowlegged manner. He is said to have had large limbs, with fleshy shins and long, hairy forearms. Though commonly described as having been very handsome with a fair complexion, when viewed up close, light scars from a childhood bout of smallpox were said to have been evident on his face. He had a full reddish-brown beard to which he applied saffron and thick curly hair which grew past his ears, though receded at the front. His teeth were bound with gold wire, with the front ones being noted as being particularly fine.

Unlike his predecessor Umar, Uthman was not a skilled orator, having grown tongue-tied during his first address as caliph. He remained somewhat apart from the other close Sahaba, having been an elegant, educated and cultured merchant-prince standing out among his poorer compatriots. This was a trait which had been acknowledged by Muhammad. One story relates that Aisha, having noted that Muhammad reclined comfortably and spoke casually with Abu Bakr and Umar, asked him why when he addressed Uthman, he chose to gather his clothing neatly and assume a formal manner. Muhammad replied that &quot;Uthman is modest and shy and if l had been informal with him, he would not have said what he had come here to say&quot;.

Uthman was a family man who led a simple life even after becoming the caliph, despite the fact that his flourishing family business had made him rich. Prior caliphs had been paid for their services from the bayt al-mal, the public treasury, but the independently wealthy Uthman never took a salary. Uthman was also a humanitarian: he customarily freed slaves every Friday, looked after the widows and orphans, and gave unlimited charity. His patience and endurance were among the characteristics that made him a successful leader. As a way of taking care of Muhammad&#x27;s wives, he doubled their allowances. Uthman was not completely plain and simple, however: he built a palace for himself in Medina, known as Al-Zawar, with a notable feature being doors of precious wood. Although Uthman paid for the palace with his own money, Shia Muslims considered it his first step towards ruling like a king.

It was asked of Uthman why he did not drink wine during the Age of Ignorance, when there was no objection to this practice (before the revelation of Islam). He replied: &quot;I saw that it made the intellect flee in its entirety, and I&#x27;ve never known of something to do this and then return in its entirety.&quot;

== Assessment and legacy ==
Uthman is said to have been the first caliph to adopt the title (&#x27;deputy of God&#x27;). The general opinion of the Sunni Muslim community and Sunni historians regarding Uthman&#x27;s rule were positive, particularly regarding his leniency; in their view, the kinsmen he appointed, such as Muawiya and Abdullah ibn Aamir, proved to be effective in both military and political management. Historians, like Zaki Muhammad, accused Uthman of corruption, particularly in the case of Waleed ibn Uqba.Perhaps the most significant act of Uthman was allowing Muawiya and Abdullah ibn Saad, governors respectively of Syria and Northern Africa, to form the first integrated Muslim navy in the Mediterranean Sea, rivalling the maritime domination of the Byzantine Empire. Ibn Saad&#x27;s conquest of the southeast coast of Spain, his stunning victory at the Battle of the Masts in Lycia, and expansion to other coasts of the Mediterranean Sea are generally overlooked. These achievements gave birth to the first Muslim standing navy, thus enabling the first Muslim maritime conquest of Cyprus and Rhodes. This subsequently paved the way for the establishment of several Muslim states in the Mediterranean Sea during the later Umayyad and Abbasid eras, which came in the form of the Emirate of Sicily and its minor vassal the Emirate of Bari, as well as the Emirate of Crete and the Aglabid Dynasty. The significance of Uthman&#x27;s naval development and its political legacy was agreed upon by Muhammad M.Ag, author of &quot;Islamic Fiscal and Monetary Policy&quot; and further strengthened by Hassan Khalileh referencing &quot;Tarikh al Bahriyya wal Islamiyya fii Misr wal Sham&quot; (&quot;History of the Seas and Islam in Egypt and Levant&quot;) by Ahmad Abaddy and Esayyed Salem.From an expansionist perspective, Uthman is regarded as skilled in conflict management, as is evident from how he dealt with the heated and troubled early Muslim conquered territories, such as Kufa and Basra, by directing the hot-headed Arab settlers to new military campaigns and expansions. This not only resulted in settling the internal conflicts in those settlements, but also further expanded Rashidun territory to as far west as southern Iberia and as far east as Sindh, Pakistan.

Lasting Religious Impact

Uthman is credited with bringing unity to the current version of the Quran. Prior to Uthman&#x27;s reign, the Qur’an did not formally exist as a fixed text, but was written in fragmentary form and as a spoken, recited work. Uthman observed this brought with it some challenges. For example, even men of the same tribe would at times disagree over how the Quran would be recited. Although some of the companions of Mohammed had attempted to bring together collections of the Quran, it had not yet been standardized. Anas bin Malik reported &quot;Hudhaifa was afraid of their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Qur&#x27;an, so he said to `Uthman, &quot;O chief of the Believers! Save this nation before they differ about the Book ... So `Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, &quot;Send us the manuscripts of the Qur&#x27;an so that we may compile the Qur&#x27;anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you.&quot; Hafsa sent it to `Uthman. `Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, Sa`id bin Al-As and `Abdur-Rahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts...&quot; This caliphate order made by Uthman gave the final form of the Quran we have today, and although a few small variants do exist in some areas, most of the variant readings and recitations have been lost or destroyed.

<text>Driving is the controlled operation and movement of a land vehicle, including cars, motorcycles, trucks, and buses. A driver&#x27;s permission to drive on public highways is granted based on a set of conditions being met, and drivers are required to follow the established road and traffic laws in the location they are driving. The word &quot;driving&quot; has etymology dating back to the 15th century. Its meaning has changed from primarily driving working animals in the 15th century to automobiles in the 1800s. Driving skills have also developed since the 15th century, with physical, mental and safety skills being required to drive. This evolution of the skills required to drive have been accompanied by the introduction of driving laws which relate not only to the driver but also to the driveability of a car.
The term &quot;driver&quot; originated in the 15th century, referring to the occupation of driving working animals such as pack or draft horses. It later applied to electric railway drivers in 1889 and motor-car drivers in 1896. The world&#x27;s first long-distance road trip by automobile was in 1888, when Bertha Benz drove a Benz Patent-Motorwagen from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany. Driving requires both physical and mental skills, as well as an understanding of the rules of the road.

In many countries, drivers must pass practical and theoretical driving tests to obtain a driving license. Physical skills required for driving include proper hand placement, gear shifting, pedal operation, steering, braking, and operation of ancillary devices. Mental skills involve hazard awareness, decision-making, evasive maneuvering, and understanding vehicle dynamics. Distractions, altered states of consciousness, and certain medical conditions can impair a driver&#x27;s mental skills.

Safety concerns in driving include poor road conditions, low visibility, texting while driving, speeding, impaired driving, sleep-deprived driving, and reckless driving. Laws regarding driving, driver licensing, and vehicle registration vary between jurisdictions. Most countries have laws against driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Some countries impose annual renewals or point systems for driver&#x27;s licenses to maintain road safety.

The World Health Organization estimates that 1.35 million people are killed each year in road traffic; it is the leading cause of death for people aged 5 to 29.

== Etymology ==

The origin of the term &quot;driver&quot;, as recorded from the 15th century, refers to the occupation of driving working animals, especially pack horses or draft horses. The verb &quot;to drive&quot; in origin means &quot;to force to move, to impel by physical force&quot;. It is first recorded of electric railway drivers in 1889 and of a &quot;motor-car driver&quot; in 1896. Early alternatives were &quot;motorneer&quot;, &quot;motor-man&quot;, &quot;motor-driver&quot; or &quot;motorist&quot;. French favors &quot;&quot;conducteur&quot; (the English equivalent, &quot;conductor&quot;&quot;, being used—from the 1830s—not of the driver but of the person in charge of passengers and collecting fares), while German influenced areas adopted &quot;Fahrer&quot; (used of coach-drivers in the 18th century, but shortened about 1900 from the compound &quot;Kraftwagenfahrer&quot;), and the verbs &quot;führen&quot;, &quot;lenken&quot;, &quot;steuern&quot;—all with a meaning &quot;steer, guide, navigate&quot;—translating to &quot;conduire&quot;.

==Introduction of the automobile==
The world&#x27;s first long-distance road trip by automobile was in August 1888, when Bertha Benz, wife of &quot;Benz Patent-Motorwagen&quot; inventor Karl Benz, drove from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany, and returned, in the third experimental Benz motor car, which had a maximum speed of , with her two teenage sons Richard and Eugen but without the consent and knowledge of her husband. She had said she wanted to visit her mother, but also intended to generate publicity for her husband&#x27;s invention, which had only been taken on short test drives before.

In 1899, F. O. Stanley and his wife Flora drove their &quot;Stanley Steamer&quot; automobile, sometimes called a &quot;locomobile&quot;, to the summit of Mount Washington in New Hampshire in the United States to generate publicity for their automobile. The journey took over two hours (not counting time to add more water); the descent was accomplished by putting the engine in low gear and much braking.

==Driving skills==

Driving in traffic is more than just knowing how to operate the mechanisms which control the vehicle; it requires knowing how to apply the rules of the road (which ensure safe and efficient sharing with other users). An effective driver also has an intuitive understanding of the basics of vehicle handling and can drive responsibly.

Although direct operation of a bicycle and a mounted animal are commonly referred to as &quot;riding&quot;, such operators are legally considered drivers and are required to obey the rules of the road. Driving over a long distance is referred to as a road trip.

In many countries, knowledge of the rules of the road, both practical and theoretical, is assessed with a driving test(s), and those who pass are issued with a driving license.

===Physical skill===

A driver must have physical skills to be able to control direction, acceleration, and deceleration. For motor vehicles, the detailed tasks include:
* Proper hand placement and seating position
* Starting the vehicle&#x27;s engine with the starting system
* Setting the transmission to the correct gear
* Depressing the pedals with one&#x27;s feet to accelerate, slow and stop the vehicle and
** If the vehicle is equipped with a manual transmission, to modulate the clutch
* Steering the vehicle&#x27;s direction with the steering wheel
* Applying brake pressure to slow or stop the vehicle
* Operating other important ancillary devices such as the indicators, headlights, parking brake and windshield wipers
* Speed and skid control

===Mental skill===

Avoiding or successfully handling an emergency driving situation can involve the following skills:
* Observing the environment for road signs, driving conditions, and hazards
* Awareness of surroundings, especially in heavy and city traffic
* Making good and quick decisions based on factors such as road and traffic conditions
* Evasive maneuvering
* Understanding vehicle dynamics
* Left- and right-hand traffic
Distractions can compromise a driver&#x27;s mental skills, as can any altered state of consciousness. One study on the subject of mobile phones and driving safety concluded that, after controlling for driving difficulty and time on task, drivers talking on a phone exhibited greater impairment than drivers who were suffering from alcohol intoxication. In the US &quot;During daylight hours, approximately 481,000 drivers are using cell phones while driving according to the publication on the National Highway Traffic Safety Association. Another survey indicated that music could adversely affect a driver&#x27;s concentration.&quot;

Seizure disorders and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease are among the leading medical causes of mental impairment among drivers in the United States and Europe. Whether or not physicians should be allowed, or even required, to report such conditions to state authorities, remains highly controversial.

===Safety===

Safety issues in driving include:
* Driving in poor road conditions and low visibility
* Texting while driving
* Speeding
* Drug–impaired driving and driving under the influence
* Distracted driving
* Sleep-deprived driving
* Reckless driving and street racing

== Teenagers ==
There is a high rate of injury and death caused by motor vehicle accidents that involve teenage drivers. There is evidence that the less teenagers drive, the risk of injury drops. There is a lack of evidence as to whether educational interventions to promote active transport and share information about the risks, cost, and stresses involved with driving are effective at reducing or delaying car driving in the teenage years.

== Driveability ==
Driveability of a vehicle means the smooth delivery of power, as demanded by the driver. Typical causes of driveability degradation are rough idling, , , , or insufficient power.

== Driving laws ==
Drivers are subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which they are driving.

=== International conventions ===
Some jurisdictions submit to some or all of the requirements of the Geneva Convention on Road Traffic of 1949.

Additionally, the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals standardises road signs, traffic lights and road markings to improve safety.

=== Local driving laws ===

The rules of the road, driver licensing and vehicle registration schemes vary considerably between jurisdictions, as do laws imposing criminal responsibility for negligent driving, vehicle safety inspections and compulsory insurance. Most countries also have differing laws against driving while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Aggressive driving and road rage have become problems for drivers in some areas.

Some countries require annual renewal of the driver&#x27;s license. This may require getting through another driving test or vision screening test to get recertified. Also, some countries use a points system for the driver&#x27;s license. Both techniques (annual renewal with tests, points system) may or may not improve road safety compared to when the driver is not continuously or annually evaluated.

====Ownership and insurance====
Car ownership does not require a driver&#x27;s license at all. As such, even with a withdrawn driver&#x27;s license, former drivers are still legally allowed to possess a car and thus have access to it. In the USA, between 1993 and 1997 13.8% of all drivers involved in fatal crashes had no driver&#x27;s license.

In some countries (such as the UK), the car itself needs have a certificate that proves the vehicle is safe and roadworthy. Also, it needs to have a minimum of third party insurance.

====Driver training====
Drivers may be required to take lessons with an approved driving instructor (or are strongly encouraged to do so) and must pass a driving test before being granted a license. Almost all countries allow all adults with good vision and health to apply to take a driving test and, if successful, to drive on public roads.

In many countries, even after passing one&#x27;s driving test, new drivers are initially subject to special restrictions under graduated driver licensing rules. For example, in Australia, novice drivers are required to carry &quot;P&quot; (&quot;provisional&quot;) plates, while in New Zealand it is called restricted (R). Many U.S. states now issue graduated drivers&#x27; licenses to novice minors. While graduated driver licensing rules vary between jurisdictions, typical restrictions include newly licensed minors not being permitted to drive or operate a motorized vehicle at night or with a passenger other than family members, zero blood alcohol, and limited power-to-weight ratio of the vehicle.

==Driving bans==
It is possible for a driver to be suspended or disqualified (banned) from driving, either for a short time or permanently. This is usually in response to a serious traffic offence (for example, causing death due to drink driving), repeated minor traffic offences (for example, accruing too many demerit points for speeding), or for a specific medical condition which prevents driving, pending a future assessment (for example, a traumatic brain injury).

Some jurisdictions implement road space rationing, where vehicles are banned from driving on certain days depending on a variety of criteria, most commonly the letters and digits in their vehicle registration plate.

A few countries banned women driving in the past. In Oman, women were not allowed to drive until 1970. In Saudi Arabia, women were not issued driving licenses until 2018. Saudi women had periodically staged driving protests against these restrictions and in September 2017, the Saudi government agreed to lift the ban, which went into effect in June 2018.

<doc id="80754" wikidata="Q2314307" url="?curid=80754" title="Division by two">
<text>In mathematics, division by [[two]] or halving has also been called mediation or dimidiation. The treatment of this as a different operation from multiplication and division by other numbers goes back to the ancient Egyptians, whose multiplication algorithm used division by two as one of its fundamental steps.
Some mathematicians as late as the sixteenth century continued to view halving as a separate operation, and it often continues to be treated separately in modern computer programming.
Performing this operation is simple in decimal arithmetic, in the binary numeral system used in computer programming, and in other even-numbered bases. To divide an odd number by 2 use the mathematical solution ((N-1)÷2)+0.5. For example, if N=7, then ((7-1)÷2)+0.5=3.5, so 7÷2=3.5.

==Binary==
In binary arithmetic, division by two can be performed by a bit shift operation that shifts the number one place to the right.
This is a form of strength reduction optimization. For example, 1101001 in binary (the decimal number 105), shifted one place to the right, is 110100 (the decimal number 52): the lowest order bit, a 1, is removed. Similarly, division by any power of two 2&quot;k&quot; may be performed by right-shifting &quot;k&quot; positions. Because bit shifts are often much faster operations than division, replacing a division by a shift in this way can be a helpful step in program optimization. However, for the sake of software portability and readability, it is often best to write programs using the division operation and trust in the compiler to perform this replacement. An example from Common Lisp:
 (setq number #b1101001) ; #b1101001 — 105
 (ash number -1) ; #b0110100 — 105 » 1 ⇒ 52
 (ash number -4) ; #b0000110 — 105 » 4 ≡ 105 / 2⁴ ⇒ 6
The above statements, however, are not always true when dealing with dividing signed binary numbers. Shifting right by 1 bit will divide by two, always rounding down. However, in some languages, division of signed binary numbers round towards 0 (which, if the result is negative, means it rounds up). For example, Java is one such language: in Java, codice_1 evaluates to codice_2, whereas codice_3 evaluates to codice_4. So in this case, the compiler &quot;cannot&quot; optimize division by two by replacing it by a bit shift, when the dividend could possibly be negative.

==Binary floating point==
In binary floating-point arithmetic, division by two can be performed by decreasing the exponent by one (as long as the result is not a subnormal number). Many programming languages provide functions that can be used to divide a floating point number by a power of two. For example, the Java programming language provides the method codice_5 for scaling by a power of two, and the C programming language provides the function codice_6 for the same purpose.

==Decimal==
The following algorithm is for decimal. However, it can be used as a model to construct an algorithm for taking half of any number &quot;N&quot; in any even base.
*Write out &quot;N&quot;, putting a zero to its left.
*Go through the digits of &quot;N&quot; in overlapping pairs, writing down digits of the result from the following table.

Example: 1738/2=?

Write 01738. We will now work on finding the result.
* 01: even digit followed by 1, write 0.
* 17: odd digit followed by 7, write 8.
* 73: odd digit followed by 3, write 6.
* 38: odd digit followed by 8, write 9.
Result: 0869.

From the example one can see that 0 is even.

If the last digit of &quot;N&quot; is odd digit one should add 0.5 to the result.

*Median, a value that splits a set of data values into two equal subsets

<doc id="80756" wikidata="Q8467" url="?curid=80756" title="Umar">
<text>Umar ibn al-Khattab (; ), also spelled Omar, was the second Rashidun caliph, ruling from August 634, when he succeeded Abu Bakr () as the second caliph, until his assassination in 644. Umar was a senior companion and father-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Umar has been called instrumental in the expansion of the Islamic world beyond Arabia.

Umar initially opposed Muhammad, who was his distant Qurayshite kinsman and later became his son-in-law. However, after his conversion to Islam in 616, Umar became the first Muslim to openly pray at the Kaaba. He participated in nearly all the battles and expeditions under Muhammad, who bestowed upon him the title &quot;al-Fārūq&quot; for his sound judgments. Following Muhammad&#x27;s death in June 632, Umar pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr () as the first caliph and served as his closest adviser. In August 634, the dying Abu Bakr nominated Umar as his successor.

Under Umar, the caliphate expanded at an unprecedented rate, conquering the Sasanian Empire and more than two-thirds of the Byzantine Empire. His attacks against the Sasanian Empire resulted in the conquest of Persia in less than two years (642–644). According to Jewish tradition, Umar set aside the Christian ban on Jews and allowed them into Jerusalem and to worship. Umar was assassinated by the Persian slave Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a Firuz in 644.

Umar is generally viewed by historians as one of the most powerful and influential Muslim caliphs in history. In Sunni Islamic tradition, he is revered as a just ruler and a paragon of Islamic virtues, with some hadiths identifying him as the second greatest of the Sahabah after Abu Bakr. However, he is viewed negatively in the Twelver Shia tradition.

==Early life==
Umar was born in Mecca to the Banu Adi clan, which was responsible for arbitration among the tribes. His father was Khattab ibn Nufayl and his mother was Hantama bint Hisham, from the tribe of Banu Makhzum. In his youth he used to tend to his father&#x27;s camels in the plains near Mecca. His merchant father was famed for his intelligence among his tribe. Umar himself said: &quot;My father, al-Khattab, was a ruthless man. He used to make me work hard; if I didn&#x27;t work he used to beat me and he used to work me to exhaustion.&quot;

Despite literacy being uncommon in pre-Islamic Arabia, Umar learned to read and write in his youth. Though not a poet himself, he developed a love for poetry and literature. According to the tradition of Quraish, while still in his teenage years, Umar learned martial arts, horse riding and wrestling. He was tall, physically powerful and a renowned wrestler. He was also a gifted orator who succeeded his father as an arbitrator among the tribes.

Umar became a merchant and made several journeys to Rome and Persia, where he is said to have met various scholars and analyzed Roman and Persian societies. As a merchant he was unsuccessful. Like others around him, Umar was fond of drinking in his pre-Islamic days.

==Early military career==

===Opposition to Islam===
In 610, Muhammad started preaching the message of Islam. However, like many others in Mecca, Umar opposed Islam and even threatened to kill Muhammad. He resolved to defend the traditional polytheistic religion of Arabia. He was adamant and cruel in opposing Muhammad, and very prominent in persecuting Muslims. He recommended Muhammad&#x27;s death. He firmly believed in the unity of the Quraish and saw the new faith of Islam as a cause of division and discord.

Due to persecution, Muhammad ordered some of his followers to migrate to Abyssinia. When a small group of Muslims migrated, Umar became worried about the future unity of the Quraish and decided to have Muhammad assassinated.

=== Conversion to Islam and service under Muhammad ===
Umar converted to Islam in 616, one year after the Migration to Abyssinia.
The story was recounted in Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s &quot;Sīrah&quot;. On his way to murder Muhammad, Umar met his best friend Nu&#x27;aym ibn Abd Allah, who had secretly converted to Islam but had not told Umar. When Umar informed him that he had set out to kill Muhammad, Nu&#x27;aym said, &quot;By God, you have deceived yourself, O Umar? Do you think that Banu Abd al-Manaf would let you run around alive once you had killed their son Muhammad? Why don&#x27;t you return to your own house and at least set it straight?&quot;

Nu&#x27;aym then told him to inquire about his own house, where his sister, Fatima bint Al-Khattab, and his brother-in-law had converted to Islam and were taking lessons from Khabbab ibn Al-Aratt. Upon arriving at her house, Umar found Fatima and her husband Saeed bin Zaid (Umar&#x27;s cousin) reciting the verses of the Quran from Surat Ta-Ha. He started quarreling with Saeed and physically attacking him. When his sister came to rescue her husband, he also started arguing with her. Yet still they kept on saying &quot;you may kill us but we will not give up Islam&quot;. Sources differ on what happened next: While some say that upon hearing these words, Umar slapped his sister so hard that she fell to the ground, others claim Fatima was merely hit by accident and lost balance when trying to pull Umar off of Saeed. In both cases, however, his sister began to bleed from her mouth. Seeing what he had done, Umar calmed down out of guilt and asked Fatima to give him what she was reciting. She replied in the negative and said &quot;You are unclean, and no unclean person can touch the Scripture.&quot; He insisted, but his sister was not prepared to allow him to touch the pages unless he washed his body. Umar at last gave in. He washed his body and then began to read the verses that were: &quot;Verily, I am Allah: there is no God but Me; so serve Me (only), and establish regular prayer for My remembrance&quot; (Quran 20:14). He wept and declared, &quot;Surely this is the word of Allah. I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah&quot;. On hearing this, Khabbab came out from where he was hiding inside and said: &quot;O, Umar! Glad tidings for you. Yesterday Muhammad prayed to Allah, &#x27;O, Allah! Strengthen Islam with either Umar or Abu Jahl, whomsoever Thou likest.&#x27; It seems that his prayer has been answered in your favour.&quot;

Umar then went to Muhammad with the same sword he intended to kill him with and accepted Islam in front of him and his companions. Umar was 39 years old when he accepted Islam.

According to one account, after his conversion to Islam, Umar openly prayed at the Kaaba as the Quraish chiefs, Abu Jahl and Abu Sufyan, reportedly watched in anger. This further helped the Muslims to gain confidence in practicing Islam openly. At this stage Umar even challenged anyone who dared to stop the Muslims from praying, although no one dared to interfere with Umar when he was openly praying.

Umar&#x27;s conversion to Islam granted power to the Muslims and to the Islamic faith in Mecca. It was after this event that Muslims offered prayers openly in Masjid al-Haram for the first time. Abdullah ibn Masud said,

==== Migration to Medina ====
In 622 CE, due to the safety offered by Yathrib (later renamed Medīnat an-Nabī, or simply Medina), Muhammad ordered his followers to migrate to Medina. Most Muslims migrated at night fearing Quraish resistance, but Umar is reported to have left openly during the day saying:

Umar migrated to Medina accompanied by his cousin and brother-in-law Saeed ibn Zaid.

==== Life in Medina ====

During Umar&#x27;s reign as caliph Muhammad ibn Muslamah was assigned the office of Chief Inspector of Accountability.
Muslims remained in peace in Medina for approximately a year before the Quraish raised an army to attack them.
In 624, Umar participated in the first battle between Muslims and Quraish of Mecca i.e., the Battle of Badr. In 625, he took part in the Battle of Uhud. In the second phase of the battle, when Khalid ibn Walid&#x27;s cavalry attacked the Muslim rear, turning the tide of battle, rumours of Muhammad&#x27;s death were spread and many Muslim warriors were routed from the battlefield, Umar among them. However, hearing that Muhammad was still alive, he went to Muhammad at the mountain of Uhud and prepared for the defence of the hill.
Later in the year Umar was a part of a campaign against the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir.
In 625, Umar&#x27;s daughter Hafsah was married to Muhammad.
Later in 627, he participated in the Battle of the Trench and also in the Battle of Banu Qurayza. In 628, Umar witnessed the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah.
In 628, he fought in the Battle of Khaybar. In 629, Muhammad sent Amr ibn al-A’as to Zaat-ul-Sallasal, after which, Muhammad sent Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah with reinforcements, including Abu Bakr and Umar, whereupon they attacked and defeated the enemy.
In 630, when Muslim armies rushed for the conquest of Mecca, he was part of that army. Later in 630, he fought in the Battle of Hunayn and the Siege of Ta&#x27;if. He was part of the Muslim army that contested the Battle of Tabouk under Muhammad&#x27;s command and he was reported to have given half of his wealth for the preparation of this expedition. He also participated in the farewell Hajj of Muhammad in 632.

==== Death of Muhammad ====
When Muhammad died on 8 June 632 Umar initially disbelieved that he was dead. It is said that Umar promised to strike the head of any man who would say that Muhammad died. Umar said: &quot;He has not died but rather he has gone to his lord just as Moses went, remaining absent from his people for forty nights after which he has returned to them. By Allah, the messenger of Allah will indeed return just as Moses returned (to his people) and he will cut off the hands and legs of those men who claimed he has died.&quot; Abu Bakr then publicly spoke to the community in the mosque, saying:
&lt;ref name=&quot;http://sunnah.com/bukhari/62/19&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Abū Bakr then recited these verses from the Qur&#x27;an :
 Hearing this, Umar fell on his knees in sorrow and acceptance. Sunni Muslims say that this denial of Muhammad&#x27;s death was occasioned by his deep love for him.

==Foundation of the caliphate==

Umar&#x27;s political capacity first manifested as the architect of the caliphate after Muhammad died on 8 June 632. While the funeral of Muhammad was being arranged a group of Muhammad&#x27;s followers who were natives of Medina, the &quot;Ansar&quot; (helpers), organised a meeting on the outskirts of the city, effectively locking out those companions known as &quot;Muhajirs&quot; (The Emigrants) including Umar. Umar found out about this meeting at Saqifah Bani Saadah, and, taking with him two other Muhajirs, Abu Bakr and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, proceeded to the meeting, presumably to head off the Ansars&#x27; plans for political separation. Arriving at the meeting, Umar was faced with a unified community of tribes from the Ansar who refused to accept the leadership of the Muhajirs. However, Umar was undeterred in his belief the caliphate should be under the control of the Muhajirs. Though the Khazraj were in disagreement, Umar, after strained negotiations lasting one or two days, brilliantly divided the Ansar into their old warring factions of Aws and Khazraj tribes. Umar resolved the divisions by placing his hand on that of Abu Bakr as a unity candidate for those gathered in the Saqifah. Others at the Saqifah followed suit, with the exception of the Khazraj tribe and their leader, Sa&#x27;d ibn &#x27;Ubada, who were ostracized as a result. The Khazraj tribe is said to have posed no significant threat as there were sufficient men of war from the Medinan tribes such as the Banu Aws to immediately organize them into a military bodyguard for Abu Bakr.

Wilferd Madelung summarises Umar&#x27;s contribution:
According to various Twelver Shia sources and Madelung, Umar and Abu Bakr had in effect mounted a political coup against Ali at the Saqifah. According to one version of narrations in primary sources, Umar and Abu Bakr are also said to have used force to try to secure the allegiance from Ali and his party. It has been reported in mainly Persian historical sources written 300 years later, such as in the History of al-Tabari, that after Ali&#x27;s refusal to pay homage, Abu Bakr sent Umar with an armed contingent to Fatimah&#x27;s house where Ali and his supporters are said to have gathered. Umar is reported to have warned those in the House that unless Ali succumbed to Abu Bakr, he would set the House on fire and under these circumstances Ali was forced to capitulate. This version of events, fully accepted by Shia scholars, is generally rejected by Sunni scholars who, in view of other reports in their literature, believe that Ali gave an oath of alliance to Abu Bakr without any grievance. But then other Sunni and Shia sources say that Ali did not swear allegiance to Abu Bakr after his election but six months later after the death of his wife Fatimah putting into question al-Tabari&#x27;s account. Either way the Sunni and the Shia accounts both accept that Ali felt that Abu Bakr should have informed him before going into the meeting with the Ansar and that Ali did swear allegiance to Abu Bakr.

Western scholars tend to agree that Ali believed he had a clear mandate to succeed Muhammad, but offer differing views as to the extent of use of force by Umar in an attempt to intimidate Ali and his supporters. For instance, Madelung discounts the possibility of the use of force and argues that:

According to Tom Holland, Umar&#x27;s historicity is beyond dispute. An Armenian bishop writing a decade or so after Qadisiyya describes Umar as a &quot;mighty potentate coordinating the advance of the sons of Ismael from the depths of the desert&quot;. Tom Holland writes &quot;What added incomparably to his prestige, was that his earth-shaking qualities as a generalissimo were combined with the most distinctive cast of virtues. Rather than ape the manner of a Caesar, as the Ghassanid kings had done, he drew on the example of a quite different kind of Christian. Umar&#x27;s threadbare robes, his diet of bread, salt and water, and his rejection of worldly riches would have reminded anyone from the desert reaches beyond Palestine of a very particular kind of person. Monks out in the Judaean desert had long been casting themselves as warriors of God. The achievement of Umar was to take such language to a literal and previously unimaginable extreme.&quot;

==Abu Bakr&#x27;s era==
Due to the delicate political situation in Arabia, Umar initially opposed military operations against the rebel tribes there, hoping to gain their support in the event of an invasion by the Romans or the Persians. Later, however, he came to agree with Abu Bakr&#x27;s strategy to crush the rebellion by force. By late 632 CE, Khalid ibn Walid had successfully united Arabia after consecutive victories against the rebels. During his own reign later, Umar would mostly adopt the policy of avoiding wars and consolidating his power in the incorporated lands rather than expanding his empire through continuous warfare.

Umar advised Abu Bakr to compile the Quran in the form of a book after 300 huffāẓ (memorizers) of the Quran died in the Battle of Yamamah.

===Appointment as a caliph===
Abu Bakr appointed Umar as his successor before dying in 634 CE. Due to his strict and autocratic nature, Umar was not a very popular figure among the notables of Medina and members of Majlis al Shura; accordingly, high-ranking companions of Abu Bakr attempted to discourage him from naming Umar.
Nevertheless, Abu Bakr decided to make Umar his successor.
Umar was well known for his extraordinary willpower, intelligence, political astuteness, impartiality, justice, and care for the poor.
Abu Bakr is reported to have said to the high-ranking advisers:

Abu Bakr was aware of Umar&#x27;s power and ability to succeed him. His was perhaps one of the smoothest transitions of power from one authority to another in the Muslim lands.
Before his death, Abu Bakr called Uthman to write his will in which he declared Umar his successor. In his will he instructed Umar to continue the conquests on Iraqi and Syrian fronts.

==Caliphate==
===Initial challenges===

Even though almost all of the Muslims had given their pledge of loyalty to Umar, he was feared more than loved. According to Muhammad Husayn Haykal, the first challenge for Umar was to win over his subjects and the members of Majlis al Shura.

Umar was a gifted orator, and he used his ability to improve his reputation among the people.

Muhammad Husayn Haykal wrote that Umar&#x27;s stress was on the well-being of the poor and underprivileged.
In addition to this, Umar, in order to improve his reputation and relation with the Banu Hashim, the tribe of Ali, delivered to the latter his disputed estates in Khayber. He followed Abu Bakr&#x27;s decision over the disputed land of Fidak, continuing to treat it as state property.
In the Ridda wars, thousands of prisoners from rebel and apostate tribes were taken away as slaves during the expeditions. Umar ordered a general amnesty for the prisoners, and their immediate emancipation. This made Umar quite popular among the Bedouin tribes.
With the necessary public support on his side, Umar took the bold decision of recalling Khalid ibn Walid from supreme command on the Roman front.

===Political and civil administration===

The government of Umar was a unitary government, where the sovereign political authority was the caliph. The empire of Umar was divided into provinces and some autonomous territories, e.g., Azerbaijan and Armenia, that had accepted the suzerainty of the caliphate. The provinces were administered by the provincial governors or &quot;Wali&quot;, personally and fastidiously selected by Umar. Provinces were further divided into about 100 districts. Each district or main city was under the charge of a junior governor or Amir, usually appointed by Umar himself, but occasionally also appointed by the provincial governor. Other officers at the provincial level were:

# &quot;Katib&quot;, the Chief Secretary.
# &quot;Katib-ud-Diwan&quot;, the Military Secretary.
# &quot;Sahib-ul-Kharaj&quot;, the Revenue Collector.
# &quot;Sahib-ul-Ahdath&quot;, the Police chief.
# &quot;Sahib-Bait-ul-Mal&quot;, the Treasury Officer.
# &quot;Qadi&quot;, the Chief Judge.

In some districts there were separate military officers, though the &quot;Wali&quot; was, in most cases, the Commander-in-chief of the army quartered in the province.

Every appointment was made in writing. At the time of appointment an instrument of instructions was issued with a view to regulating the &quot;Wali&#x27;s&quot; conduct. On assuming office, the &quot;Wali&quot; was required to assemble the people in the main mosque, and read the instrument of instructions before them.

Umar&#x27;s general instructions to his officers were:

Various other strict codes of conduct were to be obeyed by the governors and state officials. The principal officers were required to travel to Mecca on the occasion of the Hajj, during which people were free to present any complaint against them. In order to minimize the chances of corruption, Umar made it a point to pay high salaries to the staff. Provincial governors received as much as five to seven thousand dirham annually besides their shares of the spoils of war (if they were also the commander in chief of the army of their sector).
Under Umar the empire was divided into the following provinces:

# Mecca (Arabia)
# Medina (Arabia)
# Basra (Iraq)
# Kufa (Iraq)
# Jazira, in the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates
# Syria
# Iliyā&#x27; (إلياء) (Palestine)
# Ramlah (Palestine)
# Upper Egypt
# Lower Egypt
# Khorasan (Persia)
# Azerbaijan (Persia)
# Fars (Persia)

Umar was first to establish a special department for the investigation of complaints against the officers of the State. This department acted as the Administrative court, where the legal proceedings were personally led by Umar.
The department was under the charge of Muhammad ibn Maslamah, one of Umar&#x27;s most trusted men. In important cases Muhammad ibn Maslamah was deputed by Umar to proceed to the spot, investigate the charge and take action. Sometimes an Inquiry Commission was constituted to investigate the charge. On occasion, the officers against whom complaints were received were summoned to Medina, and charged in Umar&#x27;s administrative court.
Umar was known for this intelligence service through which he made his officials accountable. This service was also said to have inspired fear in his subjects.

Umar was a pioneer in some affairs:

# Umar was the first to introduce the public ministry system, where the records of officials and soldiers were kept. He also kept a record system for messages he sent to Governors and heads of state.
# He was the first to appoint police forces to keep civil order.
# He was the first to discipline the people when they became disordered.

Another important aspect of Umar&#x27;s rule was that he forbade any of his governors and agents from engaging in any sort of business dealings whilst in a position of power. An agent of Umar by the name of Al Harith ibn K&#x27;ab ibn Wahb was once found to have extra money beyond his salary and Umar enquired about his wealth. Al Harith replied that he had some money and he engaged in trade with it. Umar said: &quot;By Allah, we did not send you to engage in trade!&quot; and he took from him the profits he had made.

===Canals===
Since Medina, with a rapidly growing population, was at risk of recurring famines when crops were lacking, Umar sought to facilitate the import of grain. He ordered the building of a canal connecting the Nile to the Red Sea and an improvement of port infrastructure on the Arabian coast. When Basra was established during Umar&#x27;s rule, he started building a nine-mile canal from the Tigris to the new city for irrigation and drinking water. Al-Tabari reports that Utba ibn Ghazwan built the first canal from the Tigris River to the site of Basra when the city was in the planning stage. After the city was built, Umar appointed Abu Musa Ashaari (17-29/638 – 650) as its first governor. He began building two important canals, the al-Ubulla and the Ma&#x27;qil, linking Basra with the Tigris River. These two canals were the basis for the agricultural development for the whole Basra region and used for drinking water. Umar also adopted a policy of assigning barren lands to those who undertook to cultivate them. This policy continued during the Umayyad period and resulted in the cultivation of large areas of barren lands through the construction of irrigation canals by the state and by individuals.

===Reforms===

Under Umar&#x27;s leadership, the empire expanded; accordingly, he began to build a political structure that would hold together the vast territory. He undertook many administrative reforms and closely oversaw public policy, establishing an advanced administration for the newly conquered lands, including several new ministries and bureaucracies, and ordered a census of all the Muslim territories. During his rule, the garrison cities (&quot;amsar&quot;) of Basra and Kufa were founded or expanded. In 638, he extended and renovated the Masjid al-Haram (Grand Mosque) in Mecca and al-Masjid al-Nabawi (Mosque of the Prophet) in Medina.

Umar also ordered the expulsion to Syria and Iraq of the Christian and Jewish communities of Najran and Khaybar. He also permitted Jewish families to resettle in Jerusalem, which had previously been barred from all Jews. He issued orders that these Christians and Jews should be treated well and allotted them the equivalent amount of land in their new settlements. Umar also forbade non-Muslims from residing in the Hejaz for longer than three days. He was first to establish the army as a state department.

Umar was founder of Fiqh, or Islamic jurisprudence. He is regarded by Sunni Muslims as one of the greatest Faqih, and, as such, he started the process of codifying Islamic Law.

In 641, he established Bayt al-mal, a financial institution and started annual allowances for the Muslims.
As a leader, Umar was known for his simple, austere lifestyle. Rather than adopt the pomp and display affected by the rulers of the time, he continued to live much as he had when Muslims were poor and persecuted. In 638, his fourth year as caliph and the seventeenth year since the Hijra, he decreed that the Islamic calendar should be counted from the year of the Hijra of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina.

===Visit to Jerusalem in 637 CE===
Umar&#x27;s visit to Jerusalem is documented in several sources. A recently discovered Judeo-Arabic text has disclosed the following anecdote:

&quot;Umar ordered Gentiles and a group of Jews to sweep the area of the Temple Mount. Umar oversaw the work. The Jews who had come sent letters to the rest of the Jews in Palestine and informed them that Umar had permitted resettlement of Jerusalem by Jews. Umar, after some consultation, permitted seventy Jewish households to return. They returned to live in the southern part of the city, i.e., the Market of the Jews. (Their aim was to be near the water of &quot;Silwan&quot; and the Temple Mount and its gates). Then the Commander Umar granted them this request. The seventy families moved to Jerusalem from Tiberias and the area around it with their wives and children.&quot;

It is also reported in the name of the Alexandrian Bishop Eutychius (932–940 CE) that the rock known as the Temple Mount had been a place of ruins as far back as the time of the Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, who built churches in Jerusalem. &quot;The Byzantines,&quot; he said, &quot;had deliberately left the ancient site of the Temple as it was, and had even thrown rubbish on it, so that a great heap of rubble formed.&quot; It was only when Umar marched into Jerusalem with an army that he asked Kaab, who was Jewish before he converted to Islam, &quot;Where do you advise me to build a place of worship?&quot; Kaab indicated the Temple Rock, now a gigantic heap of ruins from the temple of Jupiter. The Jews, Kaab explained, had briefly won back their old capital a quarter of a century before (when Persians overran Syria and Palestine), but they had not had time to clear the site of the Temple, for the &quot;Rums&quot; (Byzantines) had recaptured the city. It was then that Umar ordered the rubbish on the &quot;Ṣakhra&quot; (rock) to be removed by the Nabataeans, and after three showers of heavy rain had cleansed the Rock, he instituted prayers there. To this day, the place is known as &quot;ḳubbat es ṣakhra&quot;, the Dome of the Rock.

According to lexicographer David ben Abraham al-Fasi (died before 1026 CE), the Muslim conquest of Palestine brought relief to the country&#x27;s Jewish citizens, who had previously been barred by the Byzantines from praying on the Temple Mount.

===Military expansion===
The military conquests were partially terminated between 638 and 639 during the years of great famine in Arabia and plague in the Levant. During his reign the Levant, Egypt, Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, Fezzan, Eastern Anatolia, almost the whole of the Sassanid Persian Empire including Bactria, Persia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Caucasus and Makran were annexed to the Rashidun Caliphate. According to one estimate more than 4,050 cities were captured during these military conquests. Prior to his death in 644, Umar had ceased all military expeditions apparently to consolidate his rule in recently conquered Roman Egypt and the newly conquered Sassanid Empire (642–644). At his death in November 644, his rule extended from present day Libya in the west to the Indus river in the east and the Oxus river in the north.

===Great famine===
In 638 CE, Arabia fell into severe drought followed by a famine. Soon after, the reserves of food at Medina began to run out. Umar ordered caravans of supplies from Syria and Iraq, and personally supervised their distribution. His actions saved countless lives throughout Arabia. The first governor to respond was Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, the governor of Syria and supreme commander of the Rashidun army.

Later, Abu Ubaidah paid a personal visit to Medina and acted as an officer of disaster management, which was headed personally by Umar. For internally displaced people, Umar hosted a dinner every night at Medina, which according to one estimate, had attendance of more than a hundred thousand people.

===Great plague===

While famine was ending in Arabia, many districts in Syria and Palestine were devastated by plague. While Umar was on his way to visit Syria, at Elat, he was received by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, governor of Syria, who informed him about the plague and its intensity, and suggested that Umar go back to Medina. Umar tried to persuade Abu Ubaidah to come with him to Medina, but he declined to leave his troops in that critical situation. Abu Ubaidah died in 639 of the plague, which also cost the lives of 25,000 Muslims in Syria. After the plague had weakened, in late 639, Umar visited Syria for political and administrative re-organization, as most of the veteran commanders and governors had died of the plague.

===Welfare state===

To be close to the poor, Umar lived in a simple mud hut without doors and walked the streets every evening. After consulting with the poor, Umar established the first welfare state, Bayt al-mal. The Bayt al-mal aided the Muslim and non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. The Bayt al-mal ran for hundreds of years, from the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century through the Umayyad period (661–750) and well into the Abbasid era. Umar also introduced a child benefit and pensions for the children and the elderly.

===Free trade===

Local populations of Jews and Christians, persecuted as religious minorities and taxed heavily to finance the Byzantine–Sassanid Wars, often aided Muslims to take over their lands from the Byzantines and Persians, resulting in exceptionally speedy conquests. As new areas were attached to the Caliphate, they also benefited from free trade, while trading with other areas in the Caliphate (to encourage commerce, in Islam trade is not taxed, but wealth is subject to the zakat). Since the Constitution of Medina, drafted by Muhammad, the Jews and the Christians continued to use their own laws in the Caliphate and had their own judges.

==Assassination==


In 644, Umar was assassinated by a Persian slave named Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a Firuz. His motivation for the assassination is not clear, but medieval sources attribute it to a tax dispute with his Arab master al-Mughira ibn Shu&#x27;ba.

According to some historical accounts, Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a was a Zoroastrian from Nahavand (Iran), though other reports describe him as a Christian. A highly skilled joiner and blacksmith, Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a was probably taken captive by his master al-Mughira in the Battle of Nahavand (642) and subsequently brought to Arabia, where he may also have converted to Islam. Other historical sources report that he was rather taken captive by al-Mughira in the Battle of al-Qadisiyya (636), or that he was sold to al-Mughira by Hurmuzān, an ex-Sassanid military officer who had been working for Umar as an adviser after his own capture by the Muslims. Although Medina was generally off-limits to the (non-Arabs) under Umar&#x27;s reign, Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a was exceptionally allowed to enter the capital of the early caliphate, being sent there by al-Mughira to serve the caliph.

When al-Mughira forced Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a to pay a tax of two dirhams a day, Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a turned to Umar to protest this tax. However, Umar refused to lift the tax, thus provoking Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a&#x27;s rage. Although this is the reason given by most historical accounts for Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a&#x27;s assassination of Umar, Umar&#x27;s biased policies against non-Arab captives may also have played a prominent role. One day when Umar was leading the congregational prayer in the mosque of Medina, Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a stabbed him with a double-bladed dagger. There are different versions of how this happened: according to one version, he also killed Kulayb ibn al-Bukayr al-Laythi who was behind Umar, while in another version he stabbed thirteen people who tried to restrain him. According to some accounts, the caliph died on the day of the stabbing (Wednesday of the , or according to the Julian calendar, or according to the Gregorian calendar), while other accounts maintain that he survived three more days.

Some historical sources report that Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a was taken prisoner and executed for his assassination of Umar, while other sources claim that he committed suicide. After Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a&#x27;s death, his daughter was killed by Ubayd Allah ibn Umar, one of Umar&#x27;s sons. Acting upon the claim of one man (either Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf or Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr) that they had been seen conspiring with Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a while he was holding the double-bladed dagger, Ubayd Allah also killed Hurmuzān (Umar&#x27;s Persian military adviser), and Jufayna, a Christian man from al-Hira (Iraq) who had been taken to Medina to serve as a private tutor to a family in Medina. After Ubayd Allah was detained for these murders, he threatened to kill all foreign captives residing in Medina, as well as some others. Although Ubayd Allah may have been encouraged by his sister Hafsa bint Umar to avenge their father&#x27;s death, his murder of Hurmuzān and Jufayna was likely the result of a mental breakdown rather than of a true conspiracy. It was regarded by his peers as a crime rather than as a legitimate act of retaliation.

In early 20th-century scholarship it was sometimes supposed that Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a had really been an instrument in the hands of a conspiracy, though not a conspiracy led by Hurmuzān, but rather one led by Ali, al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, and Talha ibn Ubayd Allah. These men, who according to the historical sources were appointed by Umar himself as members of the council who would elect the next caliph, were thought by scholars to have conspired to overthrow Umar&#x27;s reign and to put Ali in his place. This hypothesis, however, is rejected by more recent scholars. Nevertheless, while Ubayd Allah was subsequently acquitted of his crimes by Umar&#x27;s successor Uthman (r. 644–656), who considered the execution of Ubayd Allah an excessive measure in view of his father&#x27;s recent assassination, Ali, among others, did protest against this and vowed to apply the regular punishment for murder if he were ever to be caliph.

Umar was buried at the Green Dome in al-Masjid al-Nabawi alongside Muhammad and the caliph Abu Bakr, by the permission of Aisha given to his son Abdullah ibn Umar on Umar&#x27;s request.

===Aftermath===
On his deathbed, Umar vacillated on his succession. However, it has been reported that he said that if Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, Khalid ibn Walid or Salim, the mawla and freed Persian slave, were alive he would have appointed one of them his successor. Umar finally appointed a committee of six persons to choose a caliph from amongst them: Abdur Rahman bin Awf, Saad ibn Abi Waqqas, Talha ibn Ubaidullah, Uthman ibn Affan, Ali ibn Abi Talib and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam.

All six are among the ten to whom Paradise was promised according to Sunnis. The only one out of the &#x27;famous ten&#x27; left out of the committee who was still alive at the time was Saeed ibn Zaid, the cousin and brother-in-law of Umar. He was excluded on the basis of being related by blood and of the same tribe as Umar. Umar had a policy of not appointing anyone related to him to a position of authority even if they were qualified by his standards.

Umar appointed a band of fifty armed soldiers to protect the house where the meeting was proceeding.
Until the appointment of the next caliph, Umar appointed a notable Sahabi and mawla, Suhayb ar-Rumi (&quot;Suhayb the Roman&quot;), as a deputy or caretaker caliph to run state affairs.
While the meeting for selection of a caliph was proceeding, Abdulrehman ibn Abu Bakr and Abdur Rahman bin Awf revealed that they saw the dagger used by Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a, the assassin of Umar. A night before Umar&#x27;s assassination, reported Abdur Rahman bin Awf, he saw Hurmuzan, Jafina and Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a, while they were suspiciously discussing something. Surprised by his presence, the dagger fell; it was the same two-sided dagger used in the assassination. Abdulrehman ibn Abu Bakr, son of the late caliph Abu Bakr, confirmed that, a few days before Umar&#x27;s assassination, he saw this dagger in Hurmuzan&#x27;s possession. After this revelation, it seemed clear that it had been planned by the Persians residing in Medina. Infuriated by this, Umar&#x27;s younger son Ubaidullah ibn Umar sought to kill all the Persians in Medina. He killed Hurmuzan, Jafinah, and the daughter of Umar&#x27;s assassin Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a, who is believed to have been a Muslim. Ubaidullah was intercepted by the people of Medina, who prevented him from continuing the massacre. Amr ibn al-Aas is said to have intercepted him and convinced him to hand over his sword. The murder of Jafinah enraged Saad ibn Abi Waqqas, his foster brother, and he assaulted Ubaidullah ibn Umar; again the companions intervened. When Umar was informed about the incident, he ordered Ubaidullah imprisoned, and that the next caliph should decide his fate.

Umar died on 6 November 644; on 7 November Uthman succeeded him as caliph. After prolonged negotiations, the tribunal decided to give blood money to the victims, and released Umar&#x27;s son Ubaidullah on the ground that, after the tragedy of Umar&#x27;s assassination, people would be further infuriated by the execution of his son the very next day.

==Physical appearance==
Umar was strong, fit, athletic and good at wrestling. He is said to have participated in the wrestling matches on the occasion of the annual fair of Ukaz. From first hand accounts of his physical appearance Umar is said to be vigorous, robust and a very tall man; in markets he would tower above the people. The front part of his head was bald, always &quot;A&#x27;sara Yusran&quot; (working with two hands), both his eyes were black, with yellow skin; however, ibn Sa&#x27;ad in his book stated that he never knew that Umar had yellow skin, except for a certain part of Umar&#x27;s life where his color changed due to his frequent consumption of oil. Moreover, it is also narrated that he was initially white but his color turned dark during the Year of Ashes (18 A.H) where a Famine caused him to exert considerable effort in running the caliphate whilst there was a widespread lack of food. It is also narrated by Abu Nu&#x27;aym al-Isfahani that he had reddish-white skin. His teeth were &quot;ashnabul asnan&quot; (very white shining). He would always color his beard and take care of his hair using a type of plant.

The early Muslim historians &quot;Ibn Saad&quot; and &quot;al-Hakim&quot; mention that Abu Miriam Zir, a native of Kufa, described Umar as being &quot;advanced in years, bald, of a tawny colour – a left handed man, tall and towering above the people&quot;. Umar&#x27;s eldest son Abdullah described his father as &quot;a man of fair complexion, a ruddy tint prevailing, tall, bald and grey&quot;. Historian Salima bin al-Akwa&#x27;a said that &quot;Umar was ambidextrous, he could use both his hands equally well&quot;. On the authority of &quot;Abu Raja al-U&#x27;taridi&quot;, Ibn Asakir records that &quot;Umar was a man tall, stout, very bald, very ruddy with scanty hair on the cheeks, his moustaches large, and the ends thereof reddish&quot;. In addition, on the authority of Amir bin Rabi&#x27;ah, Ibn Sa&#x27;ad records that &quot;I saw Umar a white man, pale. Prevailing ruddiness, tall and bald&quot;.

==Assessments and legacy==

=== Political legacy ===
Umar was the first caliph to adopt the title . Umar was one of Muhammad&#x27;s chief advisers. After Muhammad&#x27;s passing, it was Umar who reconciled the Medinan Muslims to accept Abu Bakr, a Meccan, as the caliph. During Abu Bakr&#x27;s era, he actively participated as his secretary and main adviser. After succeeding Abu Bakr as caliph, Umar won over the hearts of Bedouin tribes by emancipating all their prisoners and slaves taken during the Ridda wars.

He built up an efficient administrative structure that held together his vast realm. He organized an effective intelligence network, one of the reasons for his strong grip on his bureaucracy.

Umar never appointed governors for more than two years, for they might amass too much local power. He dismissed his most successful general, Khalid ibn Walid, because he wanted people to know that it is Allah who grants victory, and to counter the cult of personality that had built up around Khalid, for the sake of the Muslim faith.

He would patrol the streets of Medina with a whip in his hand, ready to punish any offenders he might come across. It is said that Umar&#x27;s whip was feared more than the sword of another man. But with all of this, he was also known for being kindhearted, answering the needs of the fatherless and widows.

Umar&#x27;s swift imposition of justice against his governors for misdeeds made even powerful governors such as Muawiyah scared of him. Ali ibn Abu Talib, during the later rule of Uthman ibn Affan, wanted Uthman to be more strict with his governors, saying, &quot;I adjure you by God, do you know that Mu&#x27;awiyah was more afraid of Umar than was Umar&#x27;s own servant Yarfa?&quot;

Under Umar&#x27;s rule, in order to promote strict discipline, Arab soldiers were settled outside of cities, between the desert and cultivated lands in special garrison towns known as &quot;amsar&quot;. Known examples of such settlements are Basra and Kufa, in Iraq, and Fustat south of what would later become Cairo. His soldiers were forbidden to own land outside of Arabia. There were restrictions on their right to seize buildings and other immovable things usually thought of as prizes of war. Movable spoils were shared with the people of the umma, regardless of their social stratum.

A modern researcher writes about this:


In &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, Gibbon refers to Umar in the following terms:
His rule was one of the few moments in the history of Islam where Muslims were united as a single community. Abdullah ibn Masʿud would often weep whenever the subject of Umar was brought up. He said: &quot;Umar was a fortress of Islam. People would enter Islam and not leave. When he died, the fortress was breached and now people are going out of Islam&quot;. Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah before Umar died famously said: &quot;If Umar dies, Islam would be weakened&quot;. People asked him why and his reply was &quot;You will see what I am speaking about if you survive.&quot;
His greatest achievement from a religious perspective was the compilation of the Qur&#x27;an. This had not been done during the time of Muhammad. However, during the Battle of Yamama a great number of the memorizers of the Quran perished in the battle. On the advice of Umar, Abu Bakr tasked Zayd ibn Thabit with the momentous task of compiling the Quran into a single Book.

The Farooqui dynasty which ruled the Khandesh region in north of Maharashtra, India, from 14th century until 16th century, has claimed their descent from Umar lineage.

===Military legacy===

Along with Khalid ibn Walid, Umar was influential in the Ridda wars.

One strategic success was his sundering of the Byzantine-Sassanid alliance in 636, when Emperor Heraclius and Emperor Yazdegerd III allied against their common enemy. He was lucky in that the Persian Emperor Yazdegerd III couldn&#x27;t synchronize with Heraclius as planned. Umar fully availed himself of the opportunity by inducing the Byzantines to act prematurely. This was contrary to the orders of Emperor Heraclius, who presumably wanted a coordinated attack along with the Persians. Umar did this by sending reinforcements to the Roman front in the Battle of Yarmouk, with instructions that they should appear in the form of small bands, one after the other, giving the impression of a continuous stream of reinforcements that finally lured the Byzantines to an untimely battle. On the other hand, Yazdegerd III was engaged in negotiations that further gave Umar time to transfer his troops from Syria to Iraq. These troops proved decisive in the Battle of Qadisiyyah.

His strategy resulted in a Muslim victory at the Second Battle of Emesa in 638, where the pro-Byzantine Christian Arabs of Jazira, aided by the Byzantine Emperor, made an unexpected flanking movement and laid siege to Emesa (Homs).

Umar issued an order to invade the very homeland of the Christian Arab forces besieging Emesa, the Jazirah. A three-pronged attack against Jazirah was launched from Iraq. To further pressure the Christian Arab armies, Umar instructed Saad ibn Abi Waqqas, commander of Muslim forces in Iraq, to send reinforcements to Emesa. Umar himself led reinforcements there from Medina. Under this unprecedented pressure, the Christian Arabs retreated from Emesa before Muslim reinforcements could arrive. The Muslims annexed Mesopotamia and parts of Byzantine Armenia.

After the Battle of Nahavand, Umar launched a full-scale invasion of the Sassanid Persian Empire. The invasion was a series of well-coordinated multi-pronged attacks designed to isolate and destroy their targets. Umar launched the invasion by attacking the very heart of Persia, aiming to isolate Azerbaijan and eastern Persia. This was immediately followed by simultaneous attacks on Azerbaijan and Fars. Next, Sistan and Kirman were captured, thus isolating the stronghold of Persia, the Khurasan. The final expedition was launched against Khurasan, where, after the Battle of Oxus River, the Persian empire ceased to exist, and Yazdegerd III fled to Central Asia.

===Religious legacy===

====Sunni views====

Umar is remembered by Sunnis as a rigid Muslim of a sound and just disposition in matters of religion; a man they title &quot;Fārūq&quot;, meaning &quot;leader, jurist and statesman&quot;, and the second of the rightly guided caliphs. He patched his clothes with skin, took buckets on his two shoulders, always riding his donkey without the saddle, rarely laughing and never joking with anyone. On his ring is written the words &quot;Enough is Death as a reminder to you O&#x27; Umar&quot;. He did not seek advancement for his own family, but rather sought to advance the interests of the Muslim community, the &quot;ummah&quot;. According to one of Muhammad&#x27;s companions, Abd Allah ibn Mas&#x27;ud:
====Shia views====

Umar is viewed very negatively in the literature of Twelver Shi&#x27;a (the main branch of Shia Islam) and is often regarded as a usurper of Ali&#x27;s right to the Caliphate. After the Saqifah assembly chose Abu Bakr as caliph, Umar marched with armed men to Ali&#x27;s house in order to get the allegiance of Ali and his supporters. Sources indicate that a threat was made to burn Ali&#x27;s house if he refused, but the encounter ended when Fatimah, wife of Ali, intervened. According to the majority of Twelver scholar writings, Fatimah was physically assaulted by Umar, that this caused her to miscarry her child, Muhsin ibn Ali, and led to her death soon after. (see Umar at Fatimah&#x27;s house). However, some Twelver scholars, such as Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, reject these accounts of physical abuse as a &quot;myth&quot;, although Fadlallah mentioned that his speech is a probability, and not a certain reason to reject that event.

Another Shia sect, the Zaidiyyah followers of Zaid ibn Ali, generally has two views about that. Some branches, such as Jaroudiah (Sarhubiyya), don&#x27;t accept Umar and Abu Bakr as legitimate caliphs. For instance, Jarudiyya believes that Muhammad appointed Ali and believes that the denial of the Imamate of Ali after Muhammad&#x27;s passing would lead to infidelity and deviation from the right path. The other view accepts Umar and Abu Bakr as legitimate caliphs, albeit inferior to Ali. According to al-Tabari (and Ibn A&#x27;tham), when asked about Abu Bakr and Umar, Zayd ibn Ali replied: &quot;I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them...when they were entrusted with government they behaved justly with the people and acted according to the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah.&quot;

==Family==
Umar married nine women in his lifetime and had fourteen children: ten sons and four daughters.

;Wives
The known wives of Umar are:
* Zaynab bint Maz&#x27;un, she was the mother of Hafsa, Abd Allah and Abd al-Rahman al-Akbar.
* Umm Kulthum bint Jarwal, she was divorced by Umar. She was the mother of Ubayd Allah and Zayd al-Asghar.
* Qurayba bint Abi Umayya, divorced by Umar in 628.
* Jamila bint Thabit, She married Umar about between May 627 and May 628.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tabari/Fishbein vol. 8 p. 95&quot;&gt;Tabari/Fishbein vol. 8 p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; They had one son, Asim.
* Atiqa bint Zayd, she was married to Umar and had a son named Iyad.
* Umm Hakim bint al-Harith ibn Hisham, She was married to Umar in 634 and was mother of Fatima.
* Umm Kulthum bint Ali from this marriage Umar had a son named Zayd and a daughter named Ruqayya. This is, however, the Sunni view. The Shi&#x27;a do not accept that such a marriage took place. In fact, even some Sunnis scholars maintain that Umar&#x27;s wife Umm Kulthum was actually Abu Bakr&#x27;s daughter who was raised in Ali&#x27;s house.
;Sons
The sons of Umar are:
* Abd Allah, son of Zaynab bint Maz&#x27;un.

* Ubayd Allah, son of Umm Kulthum bint Jarwal.
* Zayd, son of Umm Kulthum bint Jarwal.
* Asim, son of Jamila bint Thabit.
* Iyad, son of Atiqa bint Zayd.
* Abd al-Rahman Abu&#x27;l-Mujabbar
* Abd al-Rahman &quot;Abu Shahmah&quot; ibn Umar
* Abd Allah
;Daughters

* Hafsa, daughter of Zaynab bint Maz&#x27;un.
* Fatima, daughter of Umm Hakim bint al-Harith ibn Hisham.
* Ruqayya, daughter of Umm Kulthum bint Ali.

<text>Teleology (from , and ) or finality is a branch of causality giving the reason or an explanation for something as a function of its end, its purpose, or its goal, as opposed to as a function of its cause. James Wood, in his &quot;Nuttall Encyclopaedia&quot;, explained the meaning of &quot;teleology&quot; as &quot;the doctrine of final causes, particularly the argument for the being and character of God from the being and character of His works; that the end reveals His purpose from the beginning, the end being regarded as the thought of God at the beginning, or the universe viewed as the realisation of Him and His eternal purpose.&quot;

A purpose that is imposed by human use, such as the purpose of a fork to hold food, is called &quot;extrinsic&quot;. &quot;Natural teleology&quot;, common in classical philosophy, though controversial today, contends that natural entities also have &quot;intrinsic&quot; purposes, regardless of human use or opinion. For instance, Aristotle claimed that an acorn&#x27;s intrinsic &quot;telos&quot; is to become a fully grown oak tree. Though ancient atomists rejected the notion of natural teleology, teleological accounts of non-personal or non-human nature were explored and often endorsed in ancient and medieval philosophies, but fell into disfavor during the modern era (1600–1900).

== History ==
In Western philosophy, the term and concept of &quot;teleology&quot; originated in the writings of Plato and Aristotle. Aristotle&#x27;s &#x27;four causes&#x27; give special place to the telos or &quot;final cause&quot; of each &quot;thing&quot;. In this, he followed Plato in seeing purpose in both human and nonhuman nature.

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;teleology&quot; combines Greek (, from ) and (). German philosopher Christian Wolff would coin the term, as (Latin), in his work (1728).

=== Platonic ===
In Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Phaedo&quot;, Socrates argues that true explanations for any given physical phenomenon must be teleological. He bemoans those who fail to distinguish between a thing&#x27;s necessary and sufficient causes, which he identifies respectively as material and final causes:

Socrates here argues that while the materials that compose a body are necessary conditions for its moving or acting in a certain way, they nevertheless cannot be the &quot;sufficient&quot; condition for its moving or acting as it does. For example, if Socrates is sitting in an Athenian prison, the elasticity of his tendons is what allows him to be sitting, and so a physical description of his tendons can be listed as &quot;necessary conditions&quot; or &quot;auxiliary causes&quot; of his act of sitting. However, these are only necessary conditions of Socrates&#x27; sitting. To give a physical description of Socrates&#x27; body is to say &quot;that&quot; Socrates is sitting, but it does not give any idea why &quot;it came to be&quot; that he was sitting in the first place. To say why he was sitting and not &quot;not&quot; sitting, it is necessary to explain what it is about his sitting that is &quot;good&quot;, for all things brought about (i.e., all products of actions) are brought about because the actor saw some good in them. Thus, to give an explanation of something is to determine what about it is good. Its goodness is its &quot;actual cause&quot;—its purpose, &quot;telos&quot; or &#x27;reason for which&#x27;.

=== Aristotelian ===
Aristotle argued that Democritus was wrong to attempt to reduce all things to mere necessity, because doing so neglects the aim, order, and &quot;final cause&quot;, which brings about these necessary conditions:

In &quot;Physics&quot;, using the hylomorphic theory, (using eternal forms as his model), Aristotle rejects Plato&#x27;s assumption that the universe was created by an intelligent designer. For Aristotle, natural ends are produced by &quot;natures&quot; (principles of change internal to living things), and natures, Aristotle argued, do not deliberate:

These Platonic and Aristotelian arguments ran counter to those presented earlier by Democritus and later by Lucretius, both of whom were supporters of what is now often called accidentalism:

== Modern philosophy ==

In the 17th century, philosophers such as René Descartes and Thomas Hobbes wrote in opposition to Aristotelian teleology. The suggestion that there’s more to objects than their materialism was rejected in favor of a mechanistic view of even complex creatures and organisms. According to Hobbes, writing in &quot;Leviathan&quot;:

But while science was doing a great job at explaining natural phenomena, it stopped short from explaining how life develops. In the late 18th century, Immanuel Kant acknowledged this shortcoming in his &quot;Critique of Judgement&quot;:

The chief instance, and the largest polemic morass, of teleological viewpoint in modern cosmology and ontology is the teleological argument that posits an intelligent designer as a god.

== Postmodern philosophy ==
Teleological-based &quot;grand narratives&quot; are renounced by the postmodern tradition, where teleology may be viewed as reductive, exclusionary, and harmful to those whose stories are diminished or overlooked.

Against this postmodern position, Alasdair MacIntyre has argued that a narrative understanding of oneself, of one&#x27;s capacity as an independent reasoner, one&#x27;s dependence on others and on the social practices and traditions in which one participates, all tend towards an ultimate good of liberation. Social practices may themselves be understood as teleologically oriented to internal goods, for example, practices of philosophical and scientific inquiry are teleologically ordered to the elaboration of a true understanding of their objects. MacIntyre&#x27;s &quot;After Virtue&quot; (1981) famously dismissed the naturalistic teleology of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;metaphysical biology&quot;, but he has cautiously moved from that book&#x27;s account of a sociological teleology toward an exploration of what remains valid in a more traditional teleological naturalism.

== Ethics ==
Teleology significantly informs the study of ethics, such as in:
* Business ethics: People in business commonly think in terms of purposeful action, as in, for example, management by objectives. Teleological analysis of business ethics leads to consideration of the full range of stakeholders in any business decision, including the management, the staff, the customers, the shareholders, the country, humanity and the environment.
* Medical ethics: Teleology provides a moral basis for the professional ethics of medicine, as physicians are generally concerned with outcomes and must therefore know the &quot;telos&quot; of a given treatment paradigm.

=== Consequentialism ===
The broad spectrum of &quot;consequentialist&quot; ethics—of which utilitarianism is a well-known example—focuses on the result or consequences, with such principles as John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &#x27;principle of utility&#x27;: &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number&quot;. This principle is thus teleological, though in a broader sense than is elsewhere understood in philosophy.

In the classical notion, teleology is grounded in the inherent nature of things themselves, whereas in &quot;consequentialism&quot;, teleology is imposed on nature from outside by the human will. Consequentialist theories justify inherently what most people would call evil acts by their desirable outcomes, if the good of the outcome outweighs the bad of the act. So, for example, a consequentialist theory would say it was acceptable to kill one person in order to save two or more other people. These theories may be summarized by the maxim &quot;.&quot;

=== Deontology ===

Consequentialism stands in contrast to the more classical notions of &quot;deontological&quot; ethics, of which examples include Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;categorical imperative&quot;, and Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;virtue&quot; ethics—although formulations of virtue ethics are also often consequentialist in derivation.

In deontological ethics, the goodness or badness of individual acts is primary and a larger, more desirable goal is insufficient to justify bad acts committed on the way to that goal, even if the bad acts are relatively minor and the goal is major (like telling a small lie to prevent a war and save millions of lives). In requiring all constituent acts to be good, &quot;deontological ethics&quot; is much more rigid than consequentialism, which varies by circumstance.

Practical ethics are usually a mix of the two. For example, Mill also relies on deontic maxims to guide practical behavior, but they must be justifiable by the principle of utility.

== Economics ==
A teleology of human aims played a crucial role in the work of economist Ludwig von Mises, especially in the development of his science of &quot;praxeology&quot;. Mises believed that an individual&#x27;s action is teleological because it is governed by the existence of their chosen ends. In other words, individuals select what they believe to be the most appropriate means to achieve a sought after goal or end. Mises also stressed that, with respect to human action, teleology is not independent of causality: &quot;No action can be devised and ventured upon without definite ideas about the relation of cause and effect, teleology presupposes causality.&quot;

Assuming reason and action to be predominantly influenced by ideological credence, Mises derived his portrayal of human motivation from Epicurean teachings, insofar as he assumes &quot;atomistic individualism, teleology, and libertarianism, and defines man as an egoist who seeks a maximum of happiness&quot; (i.e. the ultimate pursuit of pleasure over pain). &quot;Man strives for,&quot; Mises remarks, &quot;but never attains the perfect state of happiness described by Epicurus.&quot; Furthermore, expanding upon the Epicurean groundwork, Mises formalized his conception of pleasure and pain by assigning each specific meaning, allowing him to extrapolate his conception of attainable happiness to a critique of liberal versus socialist ideological societies. It is there, in his application of Epicurean belief to political theory, that Mises flouts Marxist theory, considering labor to be one of many of man&#x27;s &#x27;pains&#x27;, a consideration which positioned labor as a violation of his original Epicurean assumption of man&#x27;s manifest hedonistic pursuit. From here he further postulates a critical distinction between introversive labor and extroversive labor, further divaricating from basic Marxist theory, in which Marx hails labor as man&#x27;s &quot;species-essence&quot;, or his &quot;species-activity&quot;.

== Science ==
In modern science, explanations that rely on teleology are often, but not always, avoided, either because they are unnecessary or because whether they are true or false is thought to be beyond the ability of human perception and understanding to judge. But using teleology as an explanatory style, in particular within evolutionary biology, is still controversial.

Since the &quot;Novum Organum&quot; of Francis Bacon, teleological explanations in physical science tend to be deliberately avoided in favor of focus on material and efficient explanations, although some recent accounts of quantum phenomena make use of teleology. Final and formal causation came to be viewed as false or too subjective. Nonetheless, some disciplines, in particular within evolutionary biology, continue to use language that appears teleological in describing natural tendencies towards certain end conditions. Some suggest, however, that these arguments ought to be, and practicably can be, rephrased in non-teleological forms; others hold that teleological language cannot always be &quot;easily&quot; expunged from descriptions in the life sciences, at least within the bounds of practical pedagogy.

Contemporary philosophers and scientists still debate whether teleological axioms are useful or accurate in proposing modern philosophies and scientific theories. An example of the reintroduction of teleology into modern language is the notion of an &quot;attractor&quot;. Another instance is when Thomas Nagel (2012), though not a biologist, proposed a non-Darwinian account of evolution that incorporates impersonal and natural teleological laws to explain the existence of life, consciousness, rationality, and objective value. Regardless, the accuracy can also be considered independently from the usefulness: it is a common experience in pedagogy that a minimum of apparent teleology can be useful in thinking about and explaining Darwinian evolution even if there is no true teleology driving evolution. Thus it is easier to say that evolution &quot;gave&quot; wolves sharp canine teeth because those teeth &quot;serve the purpose of&quot; predation regardless of whether there is an underlying non-teleologic reality in which evolution is not an actor with intentions. In other words, because human cognition and learning often rely on the narrative structure of stories – with actors, goals, and immediate (proximate) rather than ultimate (distal) causation (see also proximate and ultimate causation) – some minimal level of teleology might be recognized as useful or at least tolerable for practical purposes even by people who reject its cosmologic accuracy. Its accuracy is upheld by Barrow and Tipler (1986), whose citations of such teleologists as Max Planck and Norbert Wiener are significant for scientific endeavor.

=== Biology ===
Apparent teleology is a recurring issue in evolutionary biology, much to the consternation of some writers.

Statements implying that nature has goals, for example where a species is said to do something &quot;in order to&quot; achieve survival appear teleological, and therefore invalid. Usually, it is possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology even if that is not the intention. John Reiss argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of such teleology by rejecting the analogy of natural selection as a watchmaker. Other arguments against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as Richard Dawkins.

Some authors, like James Lennox, have argued that Darwin was a teleologist, while others, such as Michael Ghiselin, describe this claim as a myth promoted by misinterpretations of his discussions and emphasized the distinction between using teleological metaphors and being teleological.

Biologist philosopher Francisco Ayala has argued that all statements about processes can be trivially translated into teleological statements, and vice versa, but that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of. Karen Neander has argued that the modern concept of biological &#x27;function&#x27; is dependent upon selection. So, for example, it is not possible to say that anything that simply winks into existence without going through a process of selection has functions. We decide whether an appendage has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection and function cannot be defined in the manner advocated by Reiss and Dawkins.

Ernst Mayr states that &quot;adaptedness ... is an &quot;a posteriori&quot; result rather than an &quot;a priori&quot; goal-seeking&quot;. Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of shorthand. For example, Simon Hugh Piper Maddrell writes that &quot;the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements&quot; for the sake of saving space, but that this &quot;should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection&quot;. Likewise, J. B. S. Haldane says, &quot;Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he&#x27;s unwilling to be seen with her in public.&quot;

=== Cybernetics ===

Cybernetics is the study of the communication and control of regulatory feedback both in living beings and machines, and in combinations of the two.

Arturo Rosenblueth, Norbert Wiener, and Julian Bigelow had conceived of feedback mechanisms as lending a teleology to machinery. Wiener coined the term &quot;cybernetics&quot; to denote the study of &quot;teleological mechanisms&quot;. In the cybernetic classification presented by Rosenblueth, Wiener, and Bigelow, &quot;teleology&quot; is feedback controlled purpose.

The classification system underlying cybernetics has been criticized by Frank Honywill George and Les Johnson, who cite the need for an external observability to the purposeful behavior in order to establish and validate the goal-seeking behavior. In this view, the purpose of observing and observed systems is respectively distinguished by the system&#x27;s subjective autonomy and objective control.

<doc id="80758" wikidata="Q1563565" url="?curid=80758" title="RF modulator">
<text>An RF modulator (radio frequency modulator) is an electronic device used to convert signals from devices such as media players, VCRs and game consoles to a format that can be handled by a device designed to receive a modulated RF input, such as a radio or television receiver. Its input is a baseband signal, which is used to modulate a radio frequency source.

RF modulators operate on different channels depending on the region and have been integrated into various home electronics. However, they tend to produce lower image quality than a baseband connection due to losses during the modulation and demodulation process. In professional broadcast settings, more sophisticated modulators are used.

== History ==
Prior to the introduction of specialised video connector standards such as SCART, TVs were designed to only accept signals through the aerial connector: signals originate at a TV station, are transmitted over the air, and are then received by an antenna and demodulated within the TV. When equipment was developed which could use a television receiver as its display device, such as VCRs, DVD players, early home computers, and video game consoles, the signal was modulated and sent to the RF input connector.

The aerial connector is standard on all TV sets, even very old ones. 

It also is common to have this type of RF output on video cassette recorders (VCRs), early DVD players, early video game consoles, and early home computers.

First- through fourth-generation video game consoles commonly used this method to connect to the television, which was used as the audio and video device for the game. In many cases, an RF modulator was used to take the composite output from the game and modulate it before sending the signal to the television.

Since later television designs include composite, S-Video, and component video jacks, which skip the modulation and demodulation steps, modulators are no longer included as standard equipment, and RF modulators are now largely a third-party product, purchased primarily to run newer equipment such as DVD players with an old television set.

== Design ==

RF modulation puts the desired information on to a carrier signal at a standardized frequency. Amplitude or frequency modulation may be used, as required by the receiving equipment.

Modulating a TV signal with stereo sound is relatively complex; most low-cost home TV modulators produce a signal with monaural audio. Even some units that have two or more audio inputs simply combine the left and right audio channels into one mono audio signal. Some used on very early home computers had no sound capability at all. Most cheaper modulators (i.e. not intended for professional use) lack vestigial sideband filtering.

TV modulators generally feature analog passthrough, meaning that they take input both from the device and from the usual antenna input, and the antenna input &quot;passes through&quot; to the TV, with minor insertion loss due to the added device. In some cases the antenna input is always passed through, while in other cases the antenna input is turned off when the device is outputting a signal, and only the device signal is sent onward, to reduce interference.

RF modulators produce a relatively poor picture, as image quality is lost during both the modulation from the source device, and the demodulation in the television.

Consumer audiovisual devices sold in North America typically shipped with a modulator allowing for use on analog channels 3 and 4. This channel option was provided because television channels 3 and 4 were rarely assigned in the same market due to adjacent channel interference, and the use of channel 3 overall was mostly confined to medium or smaller markets. The choice allowed the user to select the unused channel in their area so that the connected device would be able to provide video and audio on an RF feed to the television without excessive interference from a broadcast signal. 

Both channels being in use and receivable were rare and confined to the outskirts of markets (for instance, channel 3, WISC-TV in Madison, Wisconsin and WTMJ-TV, channel 4 in Milwaukee being both available in eastern Jefferson County); in this case unless the viewer received cable television service where either channel could be chosen, they would have to tune to the channel with less power to their set, an alternate input, or use an alternate modulator which instead modulated on a different channel.

Other countries had the RF output for video equipment on different groups of frequencies. For example, equipment sold in Europe, South Africa and Hong Kong used UHF channels 30–39 for this purpose. Equipment sold in Japan used channel 1 or 2 (Channel 13–16 is for cable converters). With other channels being used for RF modulation function in other regions, channel 3/4 output is a misnomer for those regions.

Recently, some RF demodulators have been marketed on obscure online markets to allow channel 3 inputs from legacy devices to work on RCA composite in.

== Uses ==
RF modulators are commonly integrated into VCRs, in video game consoles up to and including the fourth generation, and in 8- and 16-bit home computers.

Some systems were supplied with an external modulator unit that connected to both the system and to the antenna jacks of a television. One reason for this is that a device which outputs an RF signal must in general be certified by regulatory authorities—such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) — and thus by having an external RF modulator, only the modulator itself needed to be certified, rather than the entire video game system. One example was the Sup&#x27;R&#x27;Mod, designed for the Apple II.

RF modulators may also be used to take the audio and video signal from a PAL or NTSC composite video, RGB, YUV or other composite AV source, and generate a broadcast RF signal that can be fed into a television&#x27;s aerial/coaxial connector.

Multi-channel RF modulators are commonly used in home audio/video distribution. These devices have multiple audio and video inputs and one RF output. Audio/video outputs from source devices such as a DVD player, VCR, or DSS receiver are connected to the audio/video inputs on the modulator. The modulator is then programmed to broadcast the signals on a certain frequency. That RF broadcast is then received by the connected TV. When the TV is tuned to the programmed channel, the video and audio signal of the source device is accessed. RF modulation can become difficult in a CATV system. High pass, low pass, and notch filters must be used to block certain frequencies, or channels, so that the modulator can broadcast the audio/video signal of the source device on that channel.

&quot;Professional&quot; modulators such as those used in the CATV industry generally include vestigial sideband filtering which is generally absent on &quot;consumer&quot; grade modulators.

== Audio modulators ==
Audio RF modulators are used in low-end car audio to add devices like CD changers without requiring dashboard hardware upgrades. For example, a portable CD player&#x27;s headphone jack is connected to the modulator, which outputs a low-power FM radio signal that is played through the car radio. Car FM modulators suffer from loss of quality and interference issues. Later devices which would use these types of modulators would be iPods and similar portable media players.

<doc id="80763" wikidata="Q171038" url="?curid=80763" title="Softball">
<text>Softball is a popular variation of baseball, the difference being that it is played with a larger ball, on a smaller field, and with only underhand pitches (where the ball is released while the hand is primarily below the ball) permitted. Softball is played competitively at club levels, the college level, and the professional level. The game was first created in 1887 in Chicago by George Hancock.

There are two rule sets for softball generally: &quot;slow-pitch softball&quot; and &quot;fastpitch&quot;. Slow-pitch softball is commonly played recreationally, while women&#x27;s fastpitch softball was a Summer Olympic sport and can be played professionally. Softball was not included in the 2024 Summer Olympics but will return for the 2028 Summer Olympics.

Depending on the variety being played and the age and gender of the players, the particulars of the field and equipment will also vary. While distances between bases of 60 feet are standard across varieties, the pitcher&#x27;s plate ranges from 35 to 43 feet away from home plate, and the home run fence can be 220 to 300 feet away from home plate. The ball itself is typically in circumference, though this also depends on specifics of the competition. Softball rules vary in certain aspects from those of baseball. The game moves at a faster pace than traditional baseball due to the field being smaller and the bases and the fielders being closer to home plate. Softball is pitched underhand from flat ground, whereas baseball is pitched overhand on what they call a &#x27;mound&#x27;. A baseball mound is typically a pile of dirt with a rectangular pitching rubber on top, where the pitcher will then throw overhand and downward to the batter.

In the early days of softball, players often played bare-handed or with rudimentary gloves. It was not until the sport evolved that manufacturers started creating gloves tailored for softball&#x27;s larger ball size. Softball pitching styles were originally overhand: While modern softball emphasizes underhand pitching, early games allowed overhand throws.

The first softball uniforms included dresses: In women&#x27;s softball leagues during the mid-20th century, players often wore skirts or dresses as part of their uniforms. This attire was mandated to maintain a &quot;feminine&quot; appearance.

The sport was once called &quot;Kitten Ball&quot;: Before settling on the name &quot;softball,&quot; the sport went through several names, including &quot;kitten ball&quot;, &quot;mush ball&quot;, and &quot;pumpkin ball&quot;.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The earliest known softball game was played in Chicago, Illinois, on Thanksgiving Day, 1887. It took place at the Farragut Boat Club at a gathering to hear the outcome of the Yale University and Harvard University football game. When the score was announced and bets were settled, a Yale alumnus threw a boxing glove at a Harvard supporter. The Harvard fan grabbed a stick and swung at the rolled-up glove. George Hancock, a reporter there, called out &quot;Play ball!&quot; and the game began, with the boxing glove tightened into a ball, a broom handle serving as a bat. This first contest ended with a score of 41–40. The ball, being soft, was fielded barehanded.

Hancock is credited as the game&#x27;s inventor for his development of a 17-inch ball and an undersized bat in the next week. The Farragut Club soon set rules for the game, which spread quickly to outsiders. Envisioned as a way for baseball players to maintain their skills during the winter, the sport was called &quot;Indoor Baseball&quot;. Under the name of &quot;Indoor-Outdoor,&quot; the game moved outside in the next year, and the first rules were published in 1889.

In 1895, Lewis Rober Sr. of Minneapolis organized outdoor games as exercise for firefighters; this game was originally known as kitten ball. Rober&#x27;s version of the game used a ball in circumference, rather than the ball used by the Farragut club, and eventually the Minneapolis ball prevailed, although the dimensions of the Minneapolis diamond were passed over in favor of the dimensions of the Chicago one. Rober may not have been familiar with the Farragut Club rules. Fire Station No. 19 in Minneapolis, Rober&#x27;s post from 1896 to 1906, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in part for its association with the sport&#x27;s development. The first softball league outside the United States was organized in Toronto, Ontario, in 1897.

The name &quot;softball&quot; dates back to 1926. The name was coined by Walter Hakanson of the YMCA at a meeting of the National Recreation Congress. (In addition to &quot;indoor baseball&quot;, &quot;kitten ball&quot;, and &quot;diamond ball&quot;, names for the game included &quot;mush ball&quot;, and &quot;pumpkin ball&quot;.) The name softball had spread across the United States by 1930. By the 1930s, similar sports with different rules and names were being played all over the United States and Canada. A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair spurred interest in the game. By 1936, the Joint Rules Committee on Softball had standardized the rules and naming throughout the United States.

Sixteen-inch softball, also sometimes referred to as &quot;mush ball&quot; or &quot;super-slow pitch&quot; and is a direct descendant of Hancock&#x27;s original game. Defensive players are not allowed to wear fielding gloves. Sixteen-inch softball is played extensively in Chicago, where devotees such as newspaper columnist Mike Royko consider it the &quot;real&quot; game, and New Orleans. In New Orleans, sixteen-inch softball is called &quot;Cabbage Ball&quot; or &quot;batter ball&quot; and is a popular team sport in area elementary and high schools.

The first cork-centered softball was created in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, by Emil &quot;Pops&quot; Kenesky.

=== Contemporary era ===
By the 1940s, fast pitch began to dominate the game. Although slow pitch was present at the 1933 World&#x27;s Fair, the main course of action taken was to lengthen the pitching distance. Slow pitch achieved formal recognition in 1953 when it was added to the program of the Amateur Softball Association, and within a decade had surpassed fast pitch in popularity.

The first British women&#x27;s softball league was established in 1953.

The National Softball Hall of Fame and Museum was opened in Oklahoma City, United States, in 1957.

In 1991, women&#x27;s fast pitch softball was selected to debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The 1996 Olympics also marked a key era in the introduction of technology in softball. The IOC funded a landmark bio-mechanical study on pitching during the games.

In 2002, sixteen-inch slow pitch was written out of the International Softball Federation (ISF) official rules, although it is still played extensively in the United States under The Amateur Softball Association of America, or ASA rules.

The 117th meeting of the International Olympic Committee, held in Singapore in July 2005, voted to drop softball and baseball as Olympic sports for the 2012 Summer Olympics. They were reinstated for the 2020 Summer Olympics held in 2021.

Other sanctioning bodies of softball are AAU, NSA, PONY, Babe Ruth League, ASA, ISC, USSSA and Triple Crown.

==Overview==

=== Field ===

Fastpitch softball is played between two teams on a large field, with nine players (in 10u and above; 8u and below is usually played with ten players on a field at once) from one team on the field at a time. Slow-pitch softball is played with ten fielders but can be played with nine if needed.

The softball field is usually composed of a dirt or brick dust infield that contains the shape and running areas of a diamond and a grass outfield. However, the field can consist of other solid and dry surfaces such as artificial turf or asphalt. There are four bases on the infield: First base, second base, third base, and home plate. The bases are arranged in a square and are typically apart. Near the center of this square is the pitcher&#x27;s circle, and within the circle is the &quot;rubber&quot;, a small flat rectangular plate a foot and a half in length. The rubber distance from the plate in fastpitch can be as short as 35 feet for 10u players up to 43 feet for ages 14 and older. In slow pitch softball, the rubber distance can be 43, 46 or 50 feet depending on age level and the league one is playing in.

=== Game structure ===
The object of the game is to score more runs (points) than the other team by batting (hitting) a ball into play and running around the bases, touching each one in succession. The ball is a sphere of light material, covered with leather or synthetic material. It is (or, rarely, ) in circumference. The game is officiated by one or more neutral umpires. Players and umpires are generally free to ask for a brief stoppage at any time when the ball is not in play (called a time out), or immediately following a play once its outcome is clear.

The game is played in usually seven innings. Each inning is divided into a top half, in which the away team bats and tries to score runs, while the home team occupies the field and tries to record three outs; then a bottom half, when the teams&#x27; roles are reversed. Some leagues play with a reduced number of innings or with a time limit, rather than the traditional seven innings.

=== Batting and pitching ===

To start play, the offense sends a batter to home plate. The batting order must be fixed at the start of the game, and players may not bat out of turn. The defense&#x27;s pitcher stands atop the rubber and pitches the ball towards home plate using an underhand motion. In fast pitch, the pitcher is allowed to take one step back prior to releasing the ball during the forward movement. The batter attempts to hit the pitched ball with a bat, a long, round, smooth stick made of wood, metal or composite. The pitcher will use all types of pitches when on the mound to try and strike out the batter. A list of different pitches one might throw consists of a fastball, changeup, riseball, dropball, curveball and skrewball. If the pitcher throws three strikes against a batter, then the batter is out and the next batter in the order comes up to bat. A strike is recorded any time a batter swings at and misses a pitch or when a batter hits a ball foul (out of play). A strike is also recorded any time the batter does not swing at a pitch that crosses home plate within an area known as the strike zone. In fast pitch, to be within the strike zone, the pitch must cross over home plate, and as it crosses it must be above the knees and slightly below the shoulders (roughly the armpit or the shirt logo). The strike zone therefore varies from batter to batter. In slow pitch, the ball must land on a carpet or marked area behind the plate, therefore standardizing the strike zone. A pitch outside the strike zone is a ball. If the batter reaches four balls, the batter is awarded the first base in what is known as a &quot;walk&quot;. The umpire behind home plate is the sole arbiter of balls and strikes. A foul ball may or may not result in a strikeout dependent upon what association and local league rules. However, bunting a foul ball does result in a strikeout. In some associations and leagues, bunting is not allowed and results in an out. Also, if a player has two strikes, swinging and partially hitting the ball can result in an out if the catcher manages to catch the tipped ball.

=== Ball in play ===
The batter attempts to swing the bat and hit the ball fair (into the field of play). After a successful hit the batter becomes a base runner (or runner) and must run to first base. The defense attempts to field the ball and may throw the ball freely between players, so one player can field the ball while another moves to a position to put out the runner. The defense can tag the runner, by touching the runner with the ball while the runner is not on a base. The defense can also touch first base while in possession of the ball; in this case it is sufficient to beat the batter to first base and an actual tag of the batter is unnecessary. A runner is said to be &quot;thrown out&quot; when the play involves two or more defensive players. Runners generally cannot be put out when touching a base, but only one runner may occupy a base at any time and runners may not pass each other. When a ball is batted into play, runners generally must attempt to advance if there are no open bases behind them; for example, a runner on first base must run to second base if the batter puts the ball in play. In such a situation, the defense can throw to the base that the lead runner is attempting to take (a force out), and the defense can then also throw to the previous base. This can result in a multiple-out play: a double play is two outs, while a triple play, a very rare occurrence, is three outs. Runners with an open base behind them are not forced to advance and do so at their own risk; the defense must tag such runners directly to put them out rather than tagging the base.

A ball hit in the air and caught before hitting the ground, in fair or foul territory, puts the batter out. A fly ball is a ball hit high and deep, a pop fly is a ball hit high but short, and a line drive is a ball hit close to the horizontal. After the catch, runners must return to their original bases; if the defense throws the ball to that base before the runner returns, the runner is out as well, resulting in a double play. A runner who remains on the base until the ball is touched, or returns to the base (tags up) after the catch, may try to advance to the next base, at the risk of being tagged out between bases. As in baseball, the infield fly rule applies in some game situations to prevent the defense from recording multiple force outs by deliberately dropping an easy catch.

Offensive strategy is mostly just to hit the ball skillfully to let the batter reach base and advance other runners around the bases to score runs. The count of balls and strikes indicates how aggressive the batter should be. The offense may try to sacrifice, with the batter deliberately making an out in order to advance runners. Defensive strategy is more complex, as particular situations (number of outs and positions of base-runners) and particular batters call for different positioning of fielders and different tactical decisions. The defense may decide to allow a run if it can achieve one or multiple outs.

==Playing field==

The playing field is divided into &quot;fair territory&quot; and &quot;foul territory&quot;. Fair territory is further divided into the &quot;infield&quot;, and the &quot;outfield&quot;.

The field is defined by &quot;foul lines&quot; that meet at a right angle at &quot;home plate&quot;. The minimum length of the baselines varies classification of play (see below for official measurements). A fence running between the baselines defines the limits of the field; distance from home plate to the fence varies by field. The widest part of the field is the distance between the &quot;foul poles&quot;, which are erected where the foul lines meet the fence and are about apart depending on the length of the foul lines.

Home plate is one corner of a diamond with &quot;bases&quot; at each corner. The bases are cushions square, of canvas or a similar material, and not more than thick. The bases are usually securely fastened to the ground. The bases are numbered counterclockwise as first base, second base, and third base. Often, but not always, outside first base (that is, in foul territory) and adjacent and connected to it, there is a contrast-colored &quot;double base&quot; or &quot;safety base&quot; intended to prevent collisions between the first baseman and the runner. The runner runs for the foul portion of the double base after hitting the ball while the fielding team tries to throw the ball to the fair portion before the runner reaches the safety base. However, not all softball diamonds have these safety bases and they are much more common in women&#x27;s softball than in men&#x27;s. The double base is required in the U-18 Women&#x27;s Softball World Cup.

The infield consists of the diamond and the adjacent space in which the infielders (see below) normally play. The outfield is the remaining space between the baselines and between the outfield fence and the infield. The infield is usually &quot;skinned&quot; (dirt), while the outfield has grass in regulation competitions.

Near the center of the diamond is the pitching plate, or colloquially &quot;rubber&quot;. In fastpitch, a circle in diameter known as the &quot;pitching circle&quot; is marked around the pitching plate.

A field is officially required to have a warning track between from the outfield fence. However, if the game is being played on a field larger than required, no warning track is required before the temporary outfield fencing.

Located in foul territory outside both baselines are two coach&#x27;s boxes. Each box is behind a line long located from each baseline.

===Pitching distances===


==Equipment==
Equipment required in softball includes a ball, a bat (composite, metal or wooden), gloves, uniforms and protective gear. For example, helmets for the offensive team and a helmet, shin guards, and chest protector for the defensive catcher. Also cleats, sliding shorts, face masks and knee sliders may be worn for softball.

===Ball===

Despite the sport&#x27;s name, the ball is not actually soft, though it does have a lower density and greater coefficient of restitution than a baseball.

The size of the ball varies according to the variety played and age of the participants. The circumference for fastpitch for adults is (), with a mass between , while children under 12 use a ball with a circumference of () with a mass between . A 12-inch circumference ball is generally used in slow pitch. (For comparison, a baseball is in circumference and has a mass between .)

The ball is covered in two pieces of leather or similar synthetic covering that are roughly the shape of a figure-8 and sewn together along a continuous seam. The core of the ball may be made of long fiber kapok, a mixture of cork and rubber, a polyurethane mixture, or another approved material.

Before 1993, white balls were standard at all levels of play. In that year, a new, fluorescent optic yellow colored ball was first used in college softball. Yellow softballs have become the standard for all levels of play; white balls are also still allowed but are very uncommon today.

In Chicago, where softball was invented, it remains traditional to play a variant of slow-pitch with a ball in circumference. The fielders do not wear gloves or mitts. A 16-inch softball when new is rough and hard, with hand and finger injuries to fielders frequent if they do not &quot;give&quot; when receiving a ball, but the ball &quot;breaks in&quot; slightly during a game and continues to soften over time with continued play. A well-broken-in ball is called a mush ball and is favored for informal &quot;pick-up&quot; games and when playing in limited space, such as a city street (because the ball does not go as far). A 16-inch ball is also used for wheelchair softball.

===Bat===
The bat used by the batter can be made of wood, aluminum, or composite materials such as carbon fiber. Sizes may vary but they may be no more than long, in diameter, or in mass. The standard barrel diameter for both slow pitch and fast pitch softball bats is inches. Many players prefer a smaller barrel, which reduces mass and allows higher swing speed.

Although there are a variety of bats used, there are several that are banned due to performance enhancement. For example, with a thinner wall, the ball recoils faster off the bat, allowing it to travel further. Many bats may be &quot;doctored&quot; or &quot;juiced&quot; by being end loaded, shaved, or painted. End loading of a cap refers to the addition of weight manually placed at the end of the barrel to distribute more weight at the tip. Shaving bats require machine use in order to remove the inner walls of the bat to improve elasticity. Lastly, illegal bats may be painted to resemble legal ones.

===Gloves===

All defensive players wear fielding gloves, made of leather or similar material. Gloves have webbing between the thumb and forefinger, known as the &quot;pocket&quot;. Gloves used in softball are typically larger than the ones used in baseball to account for the larger ball. No glove larger than can be used in ASA (American Softball Association) sanctioned play.

While extremely rare in recreational play, there are sometimes different size gloves for different positions on the field. Catchers and first baseman have what is called a mitt, whose pockets are larger than other gloves. These are more padded. An outfielder&#x27;s glove is smaller than the catcher&#x27;s, typically 12 inches to 13 inches for fast pitch softball or 12 to 15 inches for slow pitch. An infielder&#x27;s glove is the smallest, typically from 11.5 inches to 13 inches. A pitcher&#x27;s glove is typically 11.5 to 12.5 inches for fast pitch or 11.5 to 13 inches for slow pitch.

No part of the glove is allowed to be the same color as that of the ball, including that of its seams. Pitchers are also not allowed to have any white on their gloves including the seams. The umpire has discretion to determine whether any coloring on the glove interferes with or hinders the batter from seeing the ball clearly.

===Uniform===

Each team wears a distinctive uniform. The uniform may include a cap, a shirt displaying team colors and the players&#x27; number, sliding undershorts/compression shorts (optional), socks, and pants/athletic shorts. The team is required to have all of its members wear the same uniform.

Caps, visors, and headbands are optional for female players, and have to be the same color. Caps are mandatory for male players. A fielder who chooses to wear a helmet or face mask is not required to wear a cap.

Many players use &quot;sliding shorts&quot;, otherwise known as compression shorts in other sports. These can be outfitted with a pouch for fitting a protective cup for male players. These shorts also help to protect the upper thigh when sliding into a base. &quot;Sliders&quot; may also be worn for similar protection. These are somewhat padded shin guards that extend usually from the ankle to the knee of the wearer and wrap all the way around the leg(s). They protect the shin, calf, etc. from getting bruised or damaged while sliding into home plate and make it much more comfortable to slide into the plate. Some male players use long, baseball-style pants. However, some female players now wear a shorter version of baseball pants.

At the back of the uniform, an Arabic numeral from numbers 0 through 99 must be visible. Numbers such as 02 and 2 are considered identical. Also, on the back of the uniform&#x27;s players&#x27; names are optional.

All players are required to wear shoes. They may have cleats or spikes. The spikes must extend less than away from the sole. Rounded metal spikes are illegal, as are ones made from hard plastic or other synthetic materials. High school athletes are sometimes permitted to wear metal cleats, such as in Ohio.

Many recreational leagues prohibit the use of metal cleats or spikes to reduce the possible severity of injuries when a runner slides feet-first into a fielder. At all youth (under 15) levels, in co-ed (the official terminology for mixed teams) slow pitch, and in modified pitch, metal spikes are usually not allowed.

===Protective equipment===

Helmets must be worn by batters and runners. A helmet must have two ear flaps, one on each side. Helmets and cages that are damaged or altered are forbidden. In NCAA fastpitch softball, players have the option to wear a helmet with or without a face mask. Most female travel ball teams for fastpitch softball require the batter to wear a helmet with a face mask. In male fastpitch masks are generally only used for medical reasons.

In fastpitch, the catcher must wear a protective helmet with a facemask and throat protector, shin guards and body protector. Shin guards also protect the kneecap. In slow pitch, the catcher must wear a helmet, chest protector and mask at youth levels. At adult levels, there is no formal requirement for the catcher to wear a mask, although the official rules recommend it. A catcher may optionally wear a body protector in adult slow pitch.

While mandatory for the pitcher in some slow pitch leagues, there is an option to wear a face mask on the field. It is recommended in lower age groups. It must be in proper condition and not damaged, altered, or the like. This is intended to prevent facial injuries.

==Umpires==

Decisions about plays are made by umpires. The number of umpires on a given game can range from a minimum of one to a maximum of seven. There is never more than one &quot;plate umpire&quot;; there can be up to three &quot;base umpires&quot;, and up to a further three umpires positioned in the outfield. Most fastpitch games use a crew of two umpires (one plate umpire, one base umpire).

Official umpires are often nicknamed &quot;blue&quot;, because of their uniforms – in many jurisdictions, most significantly ISF, NCAA and USA Softball games, umpires wear navy blue slacks, a light powder blue shirt, and a navy baseball cap. Some umpires wear a variant of the uniform: some umpires in USA Softball wear heather gray slacks and may also wear a navy blue or powder blue shirt; umpires from the USSSA wear red shirts with grey slacks; National Softball Association (NSA) umpires wear an official NSA white-colored umpire shirt with black pants or black shorts; NSA fastpitch umpires wear the white NSA umpires shirt and heather gray slacks.

Decisions are usually indicated by both the use of hand signals, and by vocalizing the call. Safe calls are made by signaling with flat hands facing down moving away from each other, and a verbal call of &quot;safe&quot;. Out calls are made by raising the right hand in a clenched fist, with a verbal call of &quot;out&quot;. Strikes are called by the plate umpire, who uses the same motion as the out call with a verbal call of &quot;strike&quot;. Balls are only called verbally, with no hand gesture. The umpire also has the option of not saying anything on a ball. It is understood that when he stands up, the pitch was not a strike. Foul balls are called by extending both arms up in the air with a verbal call of &quot;foul ball&quot;, while fair balls are indicated only by pointing towards fair territory with no verbal call. No signal is given for balls that are obviously foul; for closer calls that are not borderline a signal is given.

All decisions made by the umpire(s) are considered to be final. Only decisions where a rule might have been misinterpreted are considered to be protest able. At some tournaments there might be a rules interpreter or Tournament Chief Umpire (TCU) (also known as the Umpire In Chief, or UIC) available to pass judgment on such protests, but it is usually up to the league or association involved to decide if the protest would be upheld. Protests are never allowed on what are considered &quot;judgment calls&quot; – balls, strikes, and fouls. As of the 2021–22 academic year, a coach of an NCAA team is allowed to protest a call made by the umpire through what is called “video review” during the game. The opposing team only has until the next pitch to initiate the protest, and they are only allowed two a game.

==Gameplay==
A softball game can last anywhere from 3 to 7 &quot;innings&quot;, or 1–2 hours depending on the league, rules, and type of softball. The teams take turns batting. Officially, which team bats first is decided by a coin toss, although a league may decide otherwise at its discretion. The most common rule is that the home team bats second. Batting second is also called &quot;last at-bat&quot;. Many softball players prefer to bat second because they feel they have more control in the last inning, since they have the last at-bat.

In the event of a tie, extra innings are usually played until the tie is broken except in certain tournaments and championships. If the home team is leading and the road team has just finished its half of the seventh inning, the game ends because it is not necessary for the home team to bat again. In all forms of softball, the defensive team is the &quot;fielding team&quot;; the offensive team is &quot;at bat&quot; or &quot;batting&quot; and is trying to score runs.

===Pitching===
Play often, but not always, begins with the umpire saying, &quot;play ball&quot;. After the batter is ready and all fielders (except the catcher) are in fair territory at their respective positions, the pitcher stands at the pitching plate and attempts to throw the ball past the batter to the catcher behind home plate. The throw, or pitch, must be made with an underhand motion.

The pitcher throws the ball in or around the &quot;strike zone&quot;. However, in advanced play pitcher and catcher play a psychological game trying to get the batter to guess where the next pitch is going and if it will be a strike. In other instances, such as when an extremely powerful hitter comes up to bat and they are followed by a weaker hitter, a pitcher may deliberately walk the first batter based on the calculation that the next batter will be an easy out. The strike zone is slightly different in different forms of softball. A pitch that passes through that zone is a &quot;strike&quot;. A pitch at which the batter swings is also a strike, as is any hit ball that lands in foul territory that is not caught out.

A pitch that is not a strike and at which the batter does not swing is known as a &quot;ball&quot;. The number of balls and strikes is called the &quot;count&quot;. The number of balls is always given first, as 2 and 1, 2 and 2, and so on. A count of 3 and 2 is a &quot;full count&quot; since the next ball or strike will end the batter&#x27;s turn at the plate unless the ball goes foul.

==== Slow pitch ====

In most versions of slow pitch (including 16-inch) the pitch is lobbed so that the ball rises above the batter&#x27;s head and lands on a small rectangular area on the ground behind the plate called &quot;the well&quot;. Umpires will make calls based on where the ball lands behind the plate; a pitch landing in the well is a strike. These restrictions make it much easier to put the ball into play and extremely difficult to use pitching as a defensive strategy, as the physics of projectile motion limit how fast a ball can be thrown under such conditions and still be called a strike. In other varieties of slow pitch (sometimes known as &quot;modified&quot;), the only restriction is that the windmill cannot be used; thus the pitching arm cannot be raised above the shoulder and both the wind-up and the release must be underhand, still allowing for moderate speed and control in pitching.

==== Fastpitch ====

For fastpitch softball, the traditional pitching style is a &quot;windmill&quot; motion, extending the arm above the body and releasing the ball at about hip level at maximum speeds. Strength acquired in the underhand windmill motion is based on the open-to-close hip motion.

Pitches may reach high speeds. In women&#x27;s fastpitch, depending on the age group, pitchers can throw from or more. The fastest pitch ever recorded was at by Monica Abbott on June 16, 2012. At the 1996 Summer Olympics one pitch reached . Male pitching can reach speeds around . To compare, MLB players average around but can reach speeds up to . Although slower than baseball pitches, the shorter pitching distance in fastpitch results in batters having a comparable time to react to a pitch as in baseball.

Throwing fastballs for speed is not always the most important factor in fastpitch softball. Pitchers can throw breaking balls that move late in their flight, fooling batters into swinging at pitches outside the strike zone or, conversely, not swinging at pitches that pass through the strike zone. These include balls that break inwards (screwball) and outwards (curveball) on right-handed batters, starting off the plate and moving into the strike zone or starting towards the strike zone and moving off the plate. There are also rise balls that break upwards, frequently starting in the strike zone and ending above it, and drop balls that break downward. Another common pitch is the change-up, an intentionally slow pitch that initially appears to be a fastball, causing the batter to swing too early and miss or foul off the pitch. Rarer is the knuckleball, which moves slowly and erratically. Pitchers use deception as a primary tactic for getting batters out as the reaction times are approximately half a second or less. At higher levels of play, pitchers aim for the inner and outer corners of the plate when throwing fastballs and breaking pitches. Pitchers also vary the location of the pitch by height to make hitting the ball even harder for the batter. Pitchers also throw knuckleballs which are generally slower and move erratically.

A &quot;crow hop&quot; is an illegal pitch that occurs when the pitcher pushes with the pivot foot from somewhere other than the pitching plate. This often involves jumping from the pitching plate and replanting somewhere in front of the pitching plate. For an illegal pitch, the umpire extends his left arm straight out to the side and clenches his fist. This results in a ball being awarded to the batter, and any runners on base advancing to the next base. If the batter swings at the pitch that is deemed illegal and puts the ball in play, the offense is given the option to accept the results of the play or accept the penalty listed previously (exception: if the play results in the batter and any runners all advancing at least one base, the play stands and no option is given). The image to the right demonstrates a legal pitch as the push-off foot has not left the ground. The ball must be released simultaneously with the lead leg step.

===Batters===

The offensive team sends one &quot;batter&quot; at a time to home plate to use the bat to try to hit the pitch forward into fair territory. The order the players bat in, known as the &quot;batting order&quot;, must stay the same throughout the game. Substitutes and replacements must bat in the same position as the player they are replacing. In co-ed, male and female batters must alternate.

The batter stands facing the pitcher inside a &quot;batter&#x27;s box&quot; (there is one on each side of the plate to compensate for either right- or left-handed batters). The bat is held with both hands, over the shoulder, and away from the pitcher (90-degree angle). The ball is usually hit with a full swinging motion in which the bat may move through more than 360 degrees. The batter usually steps forward with the front foot, the body weight shifts forward, as the batter simultaneously swings the bat. A bunt is another form of batting. There are different types, including a sacrifice bunt, or slap bunt. There is also regular slapping in which a batter takes position on the left side of the plate and usually stands in the back of the box, but it is possible form anywhere. The batter takes a step back with their leading foot as the pitcher is in the middle of the windup, crosses over with their back foot and runs toward first base while they swing. There are many different types of slapping and they all vary depending on the batter and their strengths. There are half swing slaps, fake slaps, and full swing slaps. Each type of slap has a different purpose or goal. No matter what way the batter hits the ball, they &quot;must&quot; be inside the batter&#x27;s box when the bat makes contact with the ball. If the batter steps out of the box while swinging, the batter is out.

Once the ball is hit into fair territory, the runner must try to advance to first base or beyond. While running to first base, the batter is a &quot;batter-runner&quot;. When she safely reaches first (see below) she becomes a &quot;base-runner&quot; or &quot;runner&quot;.

A batted ball hit high in the air is a &quot;fly ball&quot;. A fly ball hit upward at an angle greater than 45 degrees is a &quot;pop fly&quot;. A batted ball driven in the air through the infield at a height at which an infielder could play it if in the right position is a &quot;line drive&quot;. A batted ball which hits the ground within the diamond is a &quot;ground ball&quot;. If a batted ball hits a player or a base, it is considered to have hit the ground.

A batter can also advance to first if hit by the pitch. If a batter is hit by the pitch it is a dead ball and she is rewarded first base. She must make an attempt to get out of the way and it is the umpire&#x27;s judgmental call whether the batter attempted to move. If he feels the batter could have moved and avoided getting hit he or she will not reward the batter first base and the pitch will be recorded as a ball.

===Getting the batter out===

The batter is out if: the batter accrues three strikes (a &quot;strikeout&quot;); a ball hit by the batter is caught before touching the ground (a &quot;flyout&quot;); the batter goes to a base that is already tagged (&quot;tagged&quot; or &quot;tag play&quot;); a fielder holding the ball touches a base which is the only base towards which the batter may run before the batter arrives there (a &quot;force out&quot; or &quot;force play&quot;); or in certain special circumstances. There is also a not so common occurrence when the batter has two strikes and swings at strike three. If the catcher does not catch the ball, the batter has the chance to run to first base and the catcher can throw the batter out at first base.

===Advancing around the bases===

If the player hits the ball and advances to a base without a fielding error or an out being recorded, then that is called a &quot;base hit&quot;. The bases must be reached in order counterclockwise, starting with first base. After hitting the ball the batter may advance as many bases as possible. An advance to first base on the one hit is a &quot;single&quot;, to second base is a &quot;double&quot;, to third base is a &quot;triple&quot;, and to home plate is a &quot;home run&quot;. Home runs are usually scored by hitting the ball over the outfield fence, but may be scored on a hit which does not go over the fence. A home run includes any ball that bounces off a fielder and goes over the fence in fair-territory (depending upon association and local league rules) or that hits the foul pole. If a batted ball bounces off a fielder (in fair territory) and goes over the fence in foul territory, or if it goes over the fence at a location that is closer than the official distance, the batter is awarded a double instead.

If a runner becomes entitled to the base where another runner is standing, the latter runner must advance to the next base. For example, if a player hits the ball and there is a runner on first, the runner on first must try to advance to second because the batter-runner is entitled to first base. If the batter reaches first base without being put out, then that player can then be forced to run towards second base the next time a ball is driven into fair territory. That is because the player must vacate first base to allow the next batter to reach it, and consequently can only go to second base, where a force out may be recorded.

Runners may advance at risk to be put out: on a hit by another player; after a fly ball has been caught, provided the player was touching a base at the time the ball was first touched or after; or (in fastpitch) automatically, when a pitch is delivered illegally.

Runners advance without liability to be put out: when a walk advances another player to the runner&#x27;s current base; or automatically in certain special circumstances described below.

In the recent years, the NCAA rules changed when concerning the batters feet while in the box. The rule now states that as long as any part of the batter&#x27;s foot is in the box the ball will stay live. It is not until the batter&#x27;s entire foot is out of the box, that the play will be declared dead and the batter called out. The SEC (college ball), however, claims that if any part of the batter&#x27;s foot is out of the box when she makes contact, she is out and the play is dead.

====Special circumstances====
If there is a &quot;wild throw&quot; (or &quot;overthrow&quot;) in which the ball goes out of the designated play area, each runner is awarded two bases from the last base touched at the time of the throw. Retreating past a made base, negates the advance to that base. If a fielder intentionally carries a ball out of play, two bases are awarded from the time the ball leaves the field of play. If this is unintentional (fielder&#x27;s momentum), the award is one base. If on a tag play, the fielder loses control (after establishing control) of the ball and it leaves the field of play, one base is awarded.

If there is a &quot;wild pitch&quot; in which the ball goes out of the designated play area, each runner is awarded one base from the base occupied at the time of the pitch.

In fastpitch, runners may try to steal bases by running to the next base on the pitch and reaching it before being tagged with the ball. The point at which a runner can steal a base varies. In fastpitch, the runner is allowed to begin stealing a base when the ball is released from the &quot;windmill&quot; pitching motion, but until recently, stealing was forbidden in slow pitch because a runner has the opportunity to get a larger head start while the slow pitch is making its way to the batter. As a result of rule changes initiated by the Independent Softball Association which later made its way to the Amateur Softball Association and the International Softball Federation in the 21st century, most levels of slow pitch permit stealing bases, provided the runner starts when the ball either touches the ground or crosses the plate. This rule encourages pitchers to be more responsible with the pitch and catchers to play defense, as balls which miss the catcher are now grounds to have stolen bases.

No matter what level of play, all baserunners must keep one foot on a base until the pitcher throws the ball or until the ball crosses the front edge of home plate (depends on association).

In fastpitch, if the catcher drops strike three (a &quot;passed ball&quot;) with no less than two outs, the batter can attempt to run to first base if first base is unoccupied. The catcher must then attempt to throw the ball to first base ahead of the runner. If he or she cannot, the runner is safe. With two outs, the batter can attempt to run to first whether or not it is already occupied.

Depending on the league in slow pitch only a foul ball with two strikes on the batter means the batter is out. Stealing in 16-inch softball is severely restricted, as a runner may only steal the base in front of them if it is open, and if they are thrown at, &quot;à la&quot; pickoff move or snap throw. This results in many inexperienced players being thrown or doubled off when they attempt to advance on a wild pickoff at another baserunner.

===Scoring runs===

A &quot;run&quot; is scored when a player has touched all four bases in order, proceeding counterclockwise around them. They need not be touched on the same play; a batter may remain safely on a base while play proceeds and attempt to advance on a later play.

A run is not scored if the last out is a force out or occurs during the same play that the runner crosses home plate. For instance, if a runner is on third base prior to a hit, and he or she crosses home plate after an out is made, either on the batter or another runner, the run is not counted.

===Ending the game===

The team with the most runs after seven innings wins the game. The last (bottom) half of the seventh inning or any remaining part of the seventh inning is not played if the team batting second is leading.

If the game is tied, play usually continues until a decision is reached, by using the international tie-breaker rules. Starting in the top of first extra inning, the batting team starts with a baserunner on second base, which is the player who is the last available to bat (in other words, the batter who last took their position in the batter&#x27;s box; regardless whether they were the last out or another runner was put out).

In games where one team leads by a large margin, the run ahead rule may come into play in order to reduce any potential embarrassment of weaker teams. In fastpitch and modified pitch, a margin of 15 runs after 3 innings, 10 after 4, or 7 after 5 is sufficient for the leading team to be declared the winner. In slow pitch, the margin is 20 runs after 4 innings or 15 after 5 innings. In the NCAA, the required margin after 5 innings is 8 runs. The mercy rule takes effect at the end of an inning. Thus, if the team batting first is ahead by enough runs for the rule to come into effect, the team batting second has their half of the inning to narrow the margin.

A game may be lost due to a &quot;forfeit&quot;. A score of 7–0 for the team not at fault is recorded (generally one run is awarded for each inning that would have been played). A forfeit may be called due to any of these circumstances: if a team does not show up to play; if one side refuses to continue play; if a team fails to resume play after a suspension of play ends; if a team uses tactics intended to unfairly delay or hasten the game; if a player removed from the game does not leave within one minute of being instructed to do so; if a player that cannot play enters the game and one pitch has been thrown; if a team does not have, for whatever reason, enough players to continue; or if after warning by the umpire, a player continues to intentionally break the rules of the game. This last rule is rarely enforced as players who break rules after being warned are usually removed.

The plate umpire may suspend play because of darkness or anything that puts players or spectators in danger. If four innings have been played and a team is in the lead, the game is recorded as it stands. If fewer than four innings have been played, the game is not considered a &quot;regulation&quot; game. Games that are not regulation or are tied when suspended are resumed from the point of suspension. If it is a championship game, it is replayed from the beginning. Team rosters may be changed.

==Positions==

There are nine players out on the field at one time in fastpitch softball and ten players in slow-pitch softball. Although the pitcher and catcher have the ball the most, each person has a specific job. In the infield there is the pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop, and third baseman. In the outfield there is a left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. In slow-pitch softball there is an extra outfielder in the outfield, who is specified as a roamer or rover. Normally, the defensive team will play with four outfielders, meaning there is a left fielder, left-center fielder, right-center fielder, and right fielder. The recent trend with tournament and league slow pitch softball play is to field five infielders instead of four outfielders. The extra infielder is commonly placed behind the pitcher on either side of second base.

===Pitcher===
The pitcher is the individual who throws the ball from the middle of the diamond. As in baseball, fastpitch softball has a rubber used to control the pitcher&#x27;s delivery. A pitcher must have both feet on the rubber at the start of their delivery but neither foot is on the rubber when the ball is released. In baseball, the rubber is on a mound of dirt as gravity is used to generate speed. In softball, the pitchers throw from within a circle and the rubber in the circle is not elevated. The circle is also used to control base runners. When the pitcher is in possession of the ball in the circle, a runner who has passed a base must either advance or return to the base. They cannot &quot;bait&quot; the pitcher to throw or they will be called out. The pitcher tries to throw the ball in the strike zone. In order to do that, they start while having the ball in their glove, they throw their arms behind their hips, they shoot forwards with their leg, which is on the same side as their glove, and leave their glove hand there and the other arm goes around the shoulder, bends the elbow, and turns their wrist toward the third baseman, and brings their arm through at the end, flicks their wrist, (which affects the ball&#x27;s speed, spin and subsequent motion), and brings the arm up, with the hand by their shoulder. They follow through with their legs turning their pitching stance into a fielding stance. They try to release the ball when they go past their hips. In softball, the pitcher uses an underarm motion to pitch the ball towards the strike zone. As soon as the pitcher makes a throw, the fielders are ready to field balls that are hit in the middle of the diamond. Pitchers usually tend to be tall, very flexible and have good upper body strength. Pitchers can be righthanded or lefthanded. The softball pitcher makes a windmill motion while throwing underhand, unlike baseball pitchers who throw overhand.

===Catcher===
The catcher is normally behind home plate in a squatted position (some plays may require the catcher to stand at an angle for intentional walks). At the plate the catcher is responsible for catching pitches, keeping mis pitched balls in front of the plate, calling pitches that are normally done through hand signals, picking off runners, and they are considered the leaders of the field. Catchers must know how many outs there are, the number of strikes and balls on the batter so they can relay that to their teammates. They must also know how many runners are on base and where the ball should be thrown next in the following play. Catchers are strong, need to be smart and quick on their feet, and have accurate throws so they can pick runners off at each base. Catchers should be able to have strong and muscular legs to squat for a long period of time. The gear worn by a catcher protects them from balls thrown in the dirt or wild pitches. The catcher is allowed to take off his/her mask to catch a pop fly or to watch the play.

===First baseman===
The first baseman is the position to the left side of the diamond when facing home plate. The major role of the first baseman is to receive throws from other defensive players in order to get a force play at first base. Another role they play is to make fielding plays on all balls hit towards first base. The first baseman is usually involved in every play that occurs on the field. Individuals at first base have quick hands and good reach and are always on the lookout to catch the player off base. They are also generally taller and left-handed throwing, which gives them an extended reach. First basemen, however, can be both left- and right-handed. Just like the catcher, first basemen may wear specific first base mitts, usually having a longer web allowing them to reach the taller throws over their head.

===Second baseman===
The second baseman plays in between the first baseman and second base itself, usually closer to second base. If the ball is hit to the left side of the field, the second baseman covers second base. If the ball is hit to right field or center field, they become the cut-off for the center fielder or the right fielder depending on who the ball was hit to. If the ball is hit to the first baseman, the second baseman then is responsible for covering first. If the ball is hit to the second baseman, they either throw the ball to second if there was already a player on first, or they throw to first if there was nobody on. If there is a runner on first and the person up to bat hits the ball to the shortstop or the third baseman, the second baseman is in charge of covering second to receive the throw from the shortstop or third baseman. Then, depending on where the runner is between home and first, the second baseman makes the decision to throw the ball to first or to hold the ball. Also, in the case of a bunt, the second baseman must cover first as the first baseman runs to get the ball from the bunt, then it is often thrown back to first base.

===Shortstop===
The shortstop fields all balls hit to the infield between the second and third bases. This individual also helps cover second and third bases, is frequently involved in force plays and double plays, and often throws the ball to the catcher to throw out runners at home plate. On steals to second base (when the runner from first is advancing to second on the pitch) the shortstop usually covers. The shortstop does not cover second base only when a right-handed batter is up. In this case, the second baseman covers the steal. Most shortstops are very quick, agile and think fast. Shortstops may play in a restricted zone but are faced with many types of hits and interact closely with the second base, third base and home plate. Often double plays are due to quick thinking/reaction by the shortstop. When a ball is hit up the middle and the shortstop catches it, they will flip the ball to the second baseman for the best result. Shortstop also takes the cut off for the left field when the play is at second base. When the ball is hit to the right side of the outfield, the shortstop then covers second base. If there is a runner on first base and there is a hit down the line or in the gap to right field, the shortstop will then go for the cut to third. Meaning the runner that is going from first to second will most likely be advancing to third, and in that case, the shortstop will be the cut off for the throw from right field to third base. Shortstop can be one of the most difficult positions to play due to the number of balls being hit in that direction.

===Third baseman===
The third baseman is the position on the right side of the diamond when you are facing home plate. They are responsible for fielding all balls hit their way including bunts. In fact, the third baseman fields more bunts than a pitcher and first baseman do. Third base is also called the &quot;Hot Corner&quot; because the ball can pop off the bat at the fielder very fast. Third baseman must have great reflexes and be very quick on their feet because not only to they need to be quick to field a bunt but also if they are unable to predict whether the batter will bunt or hit, a ball that is hit may be a line drive to the face. It also helps if they can run fast but it is not a requirement. A third baseman must have a very strong arm so that they can throw a runner out from across the diamond. Any ball that the third baseman can get, they should. They will have more momentum towards first base when fielding the ball than a shortstop. They are also closer to first base when they cut off a slower ground ball towards shortstop. Third baseman are responsible for covering third base at all times unless the ball is hit to them. In that instance, the shortstop is responsible for third base. Third baseman must be smart, have great reflexes, have a strong accurate arm, and be quick with their hands.

===Outfielders===
The outfielders are players that cover the grassy area behind the infield. Outfielders are named for their positions in the field relative to home plate. Traditional outfield positions include a left fielder, a center fielder, and a right fielder. Each player has a specific job as being an outfielder.

====Right fielder====
The right fielder&#x27;s position is on the right side of the field, in the opening between the first and second basemen, when looking at the field from behind home plate. The right fielder is part of a group of two other fielders that make up the outfield. The right fielder has a multitude of jobs over the course of a softball game. Generally, outfielders act as a back-up to the infielders when they make plays or if the ball is hit past the infield. Right field has a particular job of covering the area behind first base if the ball is to be thrown in that area. Right field is meant to cover this area if the ball gets past the first baseman. This will prevent base-runners from advancing to unwanted bases. Traditionally in the game of softball, the right fielder will have the strongest arm out of the two other outfielders. The right fielder must have the strongest arm because they have the furthest possibility to throw the ball. A right fielder will throw the ball to each base more than the other outfielders will because of their position in respect to the bases.

====Center fielder====
The center fielder&#x27;s position is in the middle of the outfield directly behind second base when looking at the field from behind home plate. The center fielder is part of a group of two other fielders that make up the outfield. Center fielders technically serve as the &quot;captains&quot; of the outfield. They are and should be the most vocal in effectively communicating with their outfielders. Since the outfielders are further apart from each other, it can be hard to hear each other. The center fielder covers the area behind second base if the ball is going to be thrown in that direction. By covering this area, if the ball does get past the infielder, the center fielder can prevent baserunners from advancing to unwanted bases. Within the game of softball, the center fielder is traditionally the fastest of the three outfielders. The center fielder needs to be the quickest because of the large area of field they must cover. Besides being a quick player, the center fielder must have a strong throwing arm because of the distance between the player and home plate.

====Left fielder====
The left fielder&#x27;s position is on the left side of the outfield behind the third baseman when looking at the field from behind home plate. The left fielder is part of a group of two other fielders that make up the outfield. Generally, outfielders act as a back-up to the infielders when they make plays or if the ball is hit past the infield. The left fielder must field their position, but also cover the area behind third base if a ball is thrown or hit in that direction. The left fielder covers this area in the case that the ball will pass the infielders. The left fielder can then prevent the base runner from advancing to unwanted bases. Besides covering certain areas of the field, the left fielder must be the smartest of the outfielders. In the left field position, the player has full view of the field, the players, the baserunners, and the batter. The left fielder must constantly be aware of the situation on the field and know what must be done in different circumstances. More advanced levels require the left fielder to be able to field the ball during &quot;slap hit&quot; situations by playing shallow. Left fielders must also play a role in any run-down situation between third base and home plate or back up any plays that happen at third base in case of an overthrow.

=== Designated player ===
In fastpitch softball, it is common for teams to use a designated player in the lineup; this player, which functions like the designated hitter in baseball, hits in place of one of the position players but does not play defense.

Unlike a designated hitter, a designated player can also become a temporary defensive substitute, and the player substituted by the designated player can return to their original position at a later point in the game. However, the only player that can be substituted as an offensive replacement (pinch runner or pinch hitter) is the defensive player the designated player originally replaced, known as the &quot;flex&quot;.

At any time, the designated player can be substituted back into the lineup in the place of the flex player, but once taken out, the designated player cannot take the place of any other player in the lineup.

====Short fielder====
In some leagues and organizations, four outfield players are utilized by each team. The extra outfielder is sometimes called the short fielder and plays somewhere behind second base, adjusting position based on the handedness or other characteristics of the batter, while the regular center fielder plays a considerably deeper position. The short fielder used as such can take away a batting strategy in softball, which is to hit soft liners over the pitcher.

However, some teams prefer to use the fourth outfielder like the others, with the center field position being shared between two players known as the left-center fielder and the right-center fielder. In this case the four outfielders are spaced equidistantly and play at roughly the same depth.

==Pitch==

In softball, a pitch is the act of throwing a softball toward home plate to start a play. All pitches are thrown from below the waist in an underhand motion. The phases of throwing include the grip, stance, windup, stride, release and follow through.

Pitchers throw a variety of pitches, each of which has a slightly different velocity, trajectory, movement, hand position, wrist position and/or arm angle. These variations are introduced to confuse the batter in various ways, and ultimately aid the defensive team in getting the batter or baserunners out. To obtain variety, and therefore enhance defensive baseball strategy, the pitcher manipulates the grip on the ball at the point of release. Variations in the grip cause the seams to &quot;catch&quot; the air differently, thereby changing the trajectory of the ball, making it harder for the batter to hit.

The selection of which pitch to use can depend on a wide variety of factors including the type of hitter who is being faced; whether there are any base runners; how many outs have been made in the inning; and the current score.

===Signaling===
The responsibility for selecting the type of pitch is traditionally made by the catcher by relaying hand signals to the pitcher with the fingers. In more advanced play, coaches may give signs to batters and/or runners to initiate special plays in certain situations. A catcher may signal to a position player that they will be trying to throw the runner out. A runner on base may see the pitch sign given by the catcher and hint it to the batter using hand or body motions.

===Pitching styles===

The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) recognizes three pitching styles:
* fastpitch
* &quot;modified&quot; fastpitch
* slow-pitch

====Fastpitch style====
The pitching distance can range between 35 feet for younger players and 43 feet for older players. Collegiate and international level pitchers pitch from 43 feet. Pitches can travel at speeds of more than .

* &quot;Windmill or &quot;Full-windmill&quot;&quot;
:- The pitcher begins with her arm at the hip. Then she brings the ball in a circular motion over the head, completes the circle back down at the hip, and snaps the hand.

* &quot;Figure 8&quot;
:- The ball is not brought over the head at all but down and behind the body and back in one smooth motion tracing out a figure eight.

* &quot;Illegal forms of pitching&quot;
** &quot;crow-hopping&quot;
** &quot;leaping&quot;

====&quot;Modified&quot; fastpitch style====
* &quot;&quot;Modified&quot; windmill&quot;
:- A &quot;modified&quot; fastpitch is identical to a &quot;windmill&quot; pitch except the arm is not brought over the head in a full windmill motion, but instead is brought behind the body (restricted back swing) and is then thrust directly forward for the release.

====Slow-pitch style====
The pitching distance is 50 feet. The pitch must be lofted in such a way that it falls onto the plate in order for it to be a called strike (the ball falls into the strike-zone instead of flying through). Strikeouts are rare in slow-pitch. Pitchers strategize to pitch the ball with a high enough arc that the batter cannot hit a line-drive. The speed of the pitches ranges from , resulting in plenty of reaction time.

* &quot;half windmill&quot;
:- High-arc pitching technique
:- The pitch must be thrown with an arc between 6-12 feet high. If the arc is not high enough, the umpire will call the pitch illegal.

===Types of pitches===

====Fastballs====
The fastball is typically the first type of pitch a player will learn. 
* Two-seam fastball
* Four-seam fastball

====Breaking balls====
* Drop ball
* Riseball
* Curveball
* Screwball
* Drop-curve
* Rise-curve
* Backdoor curve (the pitch starts out of the strike zone and curves back over the plate. Often, this pitch is thrown at a batters hip or hands with the intention of either moving them off the plate or inducing a foul ball) 
* Drop screw
* Backdoor screw (the same as a backdoor curve except the ball spins in the opposite direction of a curveball)
* Drop curve

====Changeups====
The changeup is the staple off-speed pitch, usually thrown to look like a fastball but arriving much slower to the plate. Its reduced speed coupled with its deceptive delivery is meant to confuse the batter&#x27;s timing. There are a variety of grips and techniques a pitcher may use to deliver a change up such as: 
* Flip (or &quot;Back-hand flip&quot;) release 
* Stiff wrist release
* Circle grip changeup 
* Knuckle grip changeup

=====Other off-speed pitches=====
* Knuckle curveball 
* Floater
:- This is a pitch used by pitchers in the slow-pitch game. To throw the floater accurately, pitcher holds the ball with just his or her fingertips and does not let them touch the laces. Then comes straight up with her hand and lets the ball go up to the 12-foot mark and come down. 
* Knuckleball

==Recreational play==

===Types of leagues===

It is estimated that 14.62 million Americans played at least one game of softball during the spring of 2015. It is played by men and women both recreationally and competitively.

Softball is especially popular as a recreational activity for adults. Leagues for such play are often characterized as either &quot;fun leagues&quot;, in which the outdoor exercise and player camaraderie is more important than the final result, or &quot;serious leagues&quot;. The distinction is not absolute and there can be gradations within each. Softball teams are often organized around groups of employees who play in the early evening after work in the summer. In many US cities, adult softball teams are organized by bars and clubs, hence the popular term &quot;beer league&quot; softball. The teams can be men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s or co-ed, and skill levels can range from novice to elite, with league composition reflecting that. These leagues are typically either slow-pitch or modified.

Co-ed recreational leagues, where men and women play on the same team, generally have provisions to keep men from dominating the game. League rules may stipulate that there must be an equal number of men and women on the team, or that batting order alternate male and female batters. Some leagues only require three women to play but they must be present on the field at all times. Others will allow a game to proceed when a team does not have the requisite number of women available but charge the batting team with an automatic out whenever the missing woman&#x27;s place in the batting order comes up.

===Modification of rules===
One reason for the popularity of softball is the ease of modification of its rules, thereby allowing the game to be adapted to a variety of skill levels. For example, in some slow pitch softball leagues a batter starts at bat with a count of one ball one strike. In some leagues, the number of home runs that can be hit by a team are limited. In other leagues, stealing of bases is prohibited. Some groups allow for a more defensive game by making home plate a force out for first base. This reduces scoring evenly on both sides, and allows for some margin of error.

Co-ed leagues sometimes adopt live-play rules intended to reduce gender inequality, under the assumption that men will be generally more powerful. In most co-ed or mixed gender leagues there is something called an encroachment line. This requires the outfielders to stay behind a line till the ball is hit. If an outfielder passes in front of this line before the female batter hits a fair ball, the batter will receive a single base or the result of the play, and the base runners will advance accordingly. The line will be 180 feet from home plate. One possible rule requires male batters to &quot;switch hit&quot;. Some leagues even use different balls for male and female batters. While these modified rules are common, there are questions as to their place in modern adult sports.

Some leagues require teams to use limited flight softballs. These softballs, when hit, will not go as far as regular softballs. Other leagues limit the number of runs which can be scored in an inning. Five is a common limit.

By allowing these and other modifications, softball can be enjoyed by children, teenagers, and adults. Senior leagues with players over the age of 60 are not uncommon.

An example of a rule modification is the &quot;offensive pitcher&quot; (or &quot;self pitch&quot;) often found in informal games where the emphasis is on the social rather than the competitive aspects of the game. The pitcher aids the batter by attempting to give the easiest pitch to hit. There are no walks, and a batter is normally given a fixed number of pitches to attempt to hit (usually 3 or 4). The batter is considered to strike out if the batter fails to hit the ball into fair territory after the given number of pitches. The pitcher does not act as a fielder, and a rule is often made that if a batted ball touches the pitcher, the batter is out.

In some leagues the number of pitches to walk or strikeout can be reduced. For instance, one strike is an out, and two balls is a walk. This is common in leagues where doubleheaders are played, or in late season leagues when reduced daylight is an issue. It results in shorter games, as players are more apt to swing, even at marginal pitches, rather than risk striking out on one pitch.

Many leagues also include a second first base immediately adjacent to the main one. This is usually orange and the batter running through first base is supposed to run straight through it. This minimizes the chances of a collision. By the same token some leagues have an alternate home plate and rule that plays at home are always force plays. In these cases there is typically a white line drawn approximately 1/3 of the way down the baseline that is considered a point of no return. This is designed to reduce the &quot;Pickle&quot; which can put a great strain on the ankles and knees of older baserunners.

===Indoor play===
Despite the fact that it was originally intended to be played indoors, softball is usually played outdoors. The indoor form is sometimes called Arena Softball. Indoor softball has generally the same rules as outdoor softball. Only the wall behind the batter is considered foul territory. The other walls are considered fair. Usually, there is a small area on one of the walls in the outfield that results in a home run being awarded if the batted ball hits it. Pitching is generally a little slower because of the indoor turf, or pitched through a pitching machine at younger levels. There is no limit to the number of batters a team may have available, although only so many can bat in one inning.
Some indoor facilities do not allow the use of metal cleats on the field, which are what players at the age of 14 and up generally use. Also, some tournaments may require a time limit for games.

==Professional leagues==

Women&#x27;s Professional Fastpitch (WPF) is a professional women&#x27;s softball league in the United States and was formerly the National Pro Fastpitch (NPF) and then the Women&#x27;s Pro Softball League (WPSL). The WPF league launched in June 2022. In 2024, a new professional league called the Association of Fastpitch Professionals launched with 4 teams.

The late 1970s to early 1980s marked a brief era for men&#x27;s professional softball in the United States.

==International competition==
Softball is played in over a hundred countries around the world. The highest governing body for the sport, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), has 190 member countries (excluding dependent territories). The WBSC holds world championships in several categories.

The Amateur Softball Association is the National Governing Body of Softball for the United States pursuant to the 1976 Amateur Sports Act. Due to the popularity of the sport, there are a multitude of governing bodies such as the United States Specialty Sports Association, International Softball Congress and the National Softball Association.

The WBSC holds the Women&#x27;s Softball World Cup tournaments in several categories. The tournament in each category is held every four years—two years from 2010. The most recent tournament was XII Women&#x27;s World Championship in June, 2010. All World Championships use a Page playoff system and are in fastpitch. There are also several World Cups held at 4-year intervals in different categories.

New Zealand became the Men&#x27;s World Champions winning the world title in 2013. Prior to that, Australia won the World Championship in 2009 and New Zealand had won the previous three tournaments before that.

In the Junior Men&#x27;s World Champions in 2012, Team Argentina won the world title.

===Summer Olympics===
In the Women&#x27;s Softball World Championships the United States is the most dominant team, having won three of the past four Olympic tournaments and the past seven World Championships. The current Junior Women&#x27;s World Champion is the United States.

Women&#x27;s softball debuted at the 1996 Summer Olympics and was removed from the program following the 2008 Summer Olympics. Softball and Baseball were unable to have their sport included in the program at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics. In 2012 the heads of the International Softball and Baseball Federations announced their united effort to be included in the program in 2020. &quot;The proposal calls for men&#x27;s baseball and women&#x27;s softball to be played at a single venue during 7 to 10 days. Each tournament would feature eight teams. Baseball and softball would be two disciplines under a single sports banner. The proposal awaits formal endorsement from the congress of both federations. Other sports which sought to be included in the 2020 program, when only one spot is up for filling, were: karate, roller sports, squash, sports climbing, wakeboard and wushu. The IOC executive board were to decide at their May meeting which sport to recommend for inclusion. The final decision was made in a vote of the full IOC in Buenos Aires in September 2013. Softball and Baseball were re-included in the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020, which was held in 2021. The American team had entered the gold medal match with an undefeated record, facing Japan. United States was defeated 2–0 by Japan, naming Japan the Tokyo 2020 Softball Olympic Gold Medalists.

Softball was not included in the 2024 Summer Olympics but will return for the 2028 Summer Olympics.

Even though the 2028 Summer Olympics will be held in LA, the softball and baseball events will be held in Oklahoma. 

===Participating countries and areas===

====New Zealand====
New Zealand is the most successful nation at men&#x27;s world championship softball, having won their eighth title in 2019. The New Zealand women&#x27;s team have also won a number of World Championship titles in the past. The game is widely played in New Zealand and is the second most popular summer sport behind cricket.

====Australia====

Softball is played in all states and territories in Australia and at all levels of academic education. The game is widely promoted to maintain fitness, health, personal achievements and pleasure. Australia has produced several of the world&#x27;s great men&#x27;s softball players, including Adam Folkard and Andrew Kirkpatrick, widely considered all-time greats in men&#x27;s softball. Australia has excellent softball teams which are a reflection of its coaching, education and training system.

====Japan====
Japan has had a long tradition of softball which is played at all levels in the country. Many high schools and colleges have sports programs which include softball. Like baseball, softball in Japan is intensely competitive. Japan&#x27;s win over the United States at the 2008 Olympics reflects the advanced level of play in this East Asian country.

====China====
Since the silver medal at the Atlanta Olympics, the Chinese have now made softball a priority at all levels.

====Europe====
Softball is played in almost every country in Europe, mainly fastpitch. Every two years an open women&#x27;s European fastpitch championship is held with over twenty nationals teams. Italy and Netherlands are the best nations, and both have an almost professional championship where athletes from the US, Australia and China play. In the men&#x27;s division eight to ten national teams compete for the European championship, with the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Denmark leading the way.

====United States====
In America, there are more than 1,500 college softball teams spanning five different levels: NCAA Division 1, Division 2, Division 3, NAIA, and NJCAA. There are 5 professional softball teams: the Aussie Peppers, the Chicago Bandits, the Cleveland Comets, the California Commotion, and the Canadian Wild.

Competitive fastpitch softball for girls is growing increasingly popular. All over the US, there are thousands of teams that compete year-round at tournaments. During most of these tournaments the biggest goal is not winning the tournament, but attempting to get as many college coaches as possible to observe (a) particular player or players. Competitive teams are now beginning around eight years old, if not younger. Depending on the team they can travel all over the United States or even out of the country such as to Canada, the summer and fall for many weeks and days at a time.

There are many different sanctioning bodies of softball: USSSA, ASA, ISA, NSA, WSL, USFA, Triple Crown and SASL just to name a few. One of the biggest is the Amateur Softball Association (ASA). It is known as the national governing body of softball, was established in 1933 and has over 240,000 teams. The USSSA, founded in 1968 as the United States Slo-Pitch Softball Association, but renamed in 1997 to the United States Specialty Sports Association, is the only association that still has a men&#x27;s major slow-pitch program alive. Currently, the USSSA program is run out of Viera, FL. The United States also has a competitive women&#x27;s softball team that competes in international tournaments. They represented the US each time at the Olympics until softball was removed from the Olympics.

The Amateur Softball Association of America (founded 1933) is one of the largest governing bodies for the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships. Other national and regional governing bodies also exist, including the USSSA. The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries, including the United States and Canada; before the WBSC was formed in 2013, the International Softball Federation (ISF) filled this role.

The USA Softball Men&#x27;s Fast Pitch National Team has won five World Championships (1966, 1968, 1976, 1980 and 1988) and three other medals. In the Pan-American Games, Team USA has made the finals in all seven appearances at the Games when Men&#x27;s Fast Pitch was played.

<text>SCART (also known as or , especially in France, 21-pin EuroSCART in marketing by Sharp in Asia, Euroconector in Spain, EuroAV or EXT, or EIA Multiport in the United States, as an EIA interface) is a French-originated standard and associated 21-pin connector for connecting audio-visual (AV) equipment. The name SCART comes from , &quot;Radio and Television Receiver Manufacturers&#x27; Association&quot;, the French organisation that created the connector in the mid-1970s. The related European standard EN 50049 was refined and published in 1978 by CENELEC, calling it &quot;péritelevision&quot;, but it is commonly called by the abbreviation &quot;péritel&quot; in French.

The signals carried by SCART include both composite and RGB (with composite synchronisation) video, stereo audio input/output and digital signalling. SCART is also capable of carrying S-Video signals, using the red pins for chroma. A TV can be woken from standby mode and automatically switch to the appropriate AV channel when the SCART attached device is switched on. SCART was also used for high definition signals such as 720p, 1080i, 1080p with YPbPr connection by some manufacturers, but this usage is scarce due to the advent of HDMI.

In Europe, SCART was the most common method of connecting AV equipment and was a standard connector for such devices; it was far less common elsewhere.

The official standard for SCART is CENELEC document number EN 50049–1. SCART is sometimes referred to as the IEC 933-1 standard.

== History ==

Before SCART was introduced, TVs did not offer a standardised way of inputting signals other than RF antenna connectors, and these differed between countries. Assuming other connectors even existed, devices made by various companies could have different and incompatible standards. For example, a domestic VCR could output a composite video signal through a German-originated DIN-style connector, an American-originated RCA connector, an SO239 connector or a BNC connector.

The SCART connector first appeared on TVs in 1977. It became compulsory on new TVs sold in France from January 1980, and since 1987 in eastern Europe, such as Poland. The actual French legal decree was adopted on 7 February 1980 and revoked on 3 July 2015.

The standard was subject to several amendments and at least 2 major revisions, approved by CENELEC on 13 November 1988 (EN 50049-1:1989) and 1 July 1997 (EN 50049-1:1997).

== Features ==

The SCART system was intended to simplify connecting AV equipment (including TVs, VCRs, DVD players and games consoles). To achieve this it gathered all of the analogue signal connections into a single cable with a unique connector, which normally made incorrect connections nearly impossible.

The signals carried by SCART include both composite and RGB (with composite synchronisation) video, stereo audio input/output and digital signalling. The standard was extended at the end of the 1980s to support the new S-Video signals. A TV can be awakened from standby mode, and it can automatically switch to appropriate AV channel, when the device attached to it through a SCART connector is turned on.

=== Daisy chaining ===
SCART is bi-directional regarding standard composite video and analogue audio. A TV will typically send the antenna audio and video signals to the SCART sockets all the time and watch for returned signals, to display and reproduce them. This allows &quot;transparent&quot; set-top boxes, without any tuner, which just &quot;hook&quot; and pre-process the TV signals. This feature is used for analogue pay TV like Canal Plus and was used for decoding teletext.

A VCR will often have two SCART sockets, to connect it to the TV (&quot;up&quot;, &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;1&quot;), and for video input from a set-top box or other device (&quot;down&quot;, &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;2&quot;). When idle or powered off, VCRs will usually forward the signals from the TV to the set-top decoder and send the processed result back to the TV. When a scrambled show is recorded, the VCR will drive the set-top box from its own tuner and send the unscrambled signals to the TV for viewing or simple recording control. Alternatively, the VCR could use the signals from the TV, in which case it would be inadvisable to change channels on the TV during the recording.

The &quot;down&quot; socket can also be used to connect other devices, such as DVD players or game consoles. As long as all devices have at least one &quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot; socket, this allows for connecting a virtually unlimited number of devices to a single SCART socket on the TV. While audio and video signals can travel both &quot;up&quot; to the TV and &quot;down&quot; to devices farther away from the TV, this is not true for RGB (and non-standard ) signals, which can only travel towards the TV.

&quot;Down&quot; and &quot;up&quot; are conventional. Logically, the TV is the last device of the &quot;up&quot; chain-path (stream) and the first device in the &quot;down&quot; chain path. Physically, the TV is under the device which sits on its top, hence the name &quot;set-top box&quot; for the device. Moreover, some sockets&#x27; relative position may enforce the belief that the TV is physically the last in the down direction.

Logically, the TV is on top and ends the &quot;up&quot; chain-path, translating the electrical info into an image and sound. From the same logical point of view the info stream, wherever it originates, may need processing such as decrypting (decoding, descrambling) or adding captioning/subtitles. In this case the info stream is sent logically &quot;down&quot; to dedicated function devices. From the last processing device the info stream is sent logically &quot;up&quot; to the TV, through all the chain-path. Another case is when the info stream is sent &quot;down&quot; and not expected to be sent back &quot;up&quot;, for example when sent to a recorder.

Closing a loop on either the &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; chain-path may not have useful effects and may create instability.

=== Direct connections ===

As audio and (composite) video use the same pins on &quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot; connectors (and require a crosslinked cable), it is also possible to connect two devices directly to each other without paying attention to the type of the socket.

However, this no longer works when S-Video signals are used. As straight links (RGB red and blue up) were re-purposed to carry chrominance information, the S-Video pinouts are different for &quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot; SCART connectors. Further, they are often not fully implemented.

Paying attention to the type of socket is essential when handling component RGB//S-video. Damage can be caused to devices incorrectly connected as follows:
*connecting SCART 1 (&quot;up&quot;) from one device to SCART 1 (&quot;up&quot;) of another device when both SCARTs are configured for RGB//S-video-up. Pins 7, 11 and 15 are outputs.
*connecting SCART 2 (&quot;down&quot;) from one device to SCART 2 (&quot;down&quot;) of another device when both SCARTs are configured for S-video-down. Pin 7 is an output.
*connecting SCART 1 (&quot;up&quot;) from a device configured RGB/, to SCART 2 (&quot;down&quot;) of another device configured with S-video-down. Pin 7 is an output.

Damaging pins 7, 11 or 15 may result in yellow, purple or blue/green images, due to the missing blue, green or red components respectively. When using S-video, damaging pin 7 or 15 may result in black-white images due to the missing chroma component (&quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot; respectively). Similarly, damaging pins 7 and 15 (PB and PR) while leaving pin 11 (Y) undamaged may result in black-white images when using . Damaging more than one of these pins may result in combined effects.

=== RGB overlays ===

SCART enables a device to command the TV to very quickly switch between signals, in order to create overlays in the image. In order to implement captioning or subtitles, a SCART set-top box does not have to process and send back a complete new video signal, which would require full decoding and re-encoding of the color information, a signal-degrading and costly process, especially given the presence of different standards in Europe. The box can instead ask the TV to stop displaying the normal signal and display a signal it generates internally for selected image areas, with pixel-level granularity. This can also be driven by the use of a &quot;transparent&quot; color in a teletext page.

=== Device control ===

SCART allows a connected device to bring it in and out of &quot;standby&quot; mode or to switch it to the AV channel. A VCR or other playback device will optimally power on when a cassette is inserted, power on the TV (or switch it to video mode) and then start playing immediately if the cassette write protection tab is absent. When turned off, the VCR will ask the TV to power off, which it will do if it had been powered on by the VCR&#x27;s request and if it remained in video mode. Only some TVs will do this—most only implement automatic switching to and from the SCART input.

The same signal can be used by a satellite receiver or set-top box to signal a VCR that it is supposed to start and stop recording (&quot;pin 8 recording&quot;). This configuration usually requires that the VCR be farther from the TV than the source, so the signal usually travels &quot;down&quot;.

SCART also supports automatic widescreen switching. This is an extension of the functionality of pin 8, which previously only indicated to the TV that an external signal should be displayed. Ideally, a widescreen source should offer three operating modes in order to deal with widescreen signals:

*Widescreen, for TVs that are widescreen or capable of otherwise dealing with widescreen images
*Letterbox, which adds blank space (usually black) at the top and bottom of the image to give a 4:3 aspect ratio
*Pan and scan, which crops the image to achieve a 4:3 aspect ratio; only the centre portion is displayed with the sides truncated (as if zoomed into).
In the first case, the widescreen pin allows to indicate the current signal format, which allows widescreen TVs to adjust the image width, and widescreen-capable standard TVs to compress the scan lines of the image vertically to a letterbox shape portion of the picture tube. In the second case, the widescreen SCART signal is never active and the signal source performs the adaptations itself so that the image has always a standard format as a result. Some sources assume that the TV is always capable of widescreen functionality and hence never perform the adaptations. Some sources will not even issue the widescreen signal or maintain it at the same level all the time. Other sources might offer the option of truncating the sides, but not of letterboxing, which requires significantly more processing. Notably, the circuitry of the early widescreen MAC standard decoders (e.g. the &quot;Visiopass&quot;) could not letterbox. The limitations apply mostly to satellite TVs, while DVD players can always at least letterbox and often &quot;zoom&quot;.

== Design ==

=== Cables ===
The cables for connecting equipment together have a male plug at each end. Some of the wires such as ground, data, switching and RGB connect to the identical pin number at each end. Others such as audio and video are swapped so that an output signal at one end of the cable connects to an input signal at the other end. The complete list of wires that are swapped are: pins 1 and 2, pins 3 and 6, pins 17 and 18, pins 19 and 20.

The original SCART specification provided for different cable (cordset) types denoted by a key color, but color-coding is rarely used and cables often use different, non-standard configurations.

Maximum SCART cable length is estimated to be about 10 to 15 metres without amplification.

Due to the relatively high signal voltages used in SCART, &quot;hot plugging&quot; (connecting or disconnecting devices while they are on) is not recommended. Although there is no risk of personal injury, there is the possibility of damaging electronics within the devices if the connector is inserted improperly. Also, since many TVs are Class II (double-insulated) rather than earthed, the large exposed shield on the SCART connector will be held at approximately half mains voltage if it is plugged into a powered TV with the other end unplugged. If the cable is then plugged into an earthed device with a metal case, inadvertent contact with the SCART cable shield while the earthed device is touched with the other hand can cause a painful electric shock. For this reason the device end of the cable should always be plugged in first and the TV end plugged in last.

Quality differences exist in SCART cables. While a proper SCART cable uses miniature coaxial cables for the video signals, cheap SCART cables often use plain wires for all signals, resulting in a loss of image quality and greatly reducing the maximum cable length. A common problem on a cheap SCART cable is that a TV outputs a composite video signal from its internal tuner and this is induced or crosstalked onto an incoming video signal due to inadequate or non-existent screening; the result is ghostly images or shimmering superimposed on the incoming signal. To non-destructively verify if a SCART cable uses coaxial cables, unscrew the strain relief at the SCART connector and fold open the plastic shell.

Using higher-quality cables such as those with ribbon cords that have properly shielded coaxial cables inside might help in reducing a &#x27;ghosting&#x27; effect, but it does not always eliminate it due to various factors. A more permanent method is to remove pin 19 (Video Out) from the SCART plug that is put into the TV, preventing a signal from being broadcast by the TV into the cable, so it cannot cross-talk with the incoming signal.

=== Blanking and switching ===

Two pins provide switching signals.

Pin 8, the &quot;switch signal&quot; pin, carries a DC voltage from the source that indicates the type of video present.
*0 V–2 V means no signal, or internal bypass
*4.5 V–7 V (nominal 6 V) means a widescreen (16:9) signal
*9.5 V–12 V (nominal 12 V) means a normal (4:3) signal

Pin 16, the &quot;blanking signal&quot; pin, carries a signal from the source that indicates that the signal is either RGB or composite.
*0 V–0.4 V means composite.
*1 V–3 V (nominal 1 V) means RGB only.

The original specification defined pin 16 as a high frequency (up to 3 MHz) signal that blanked the composite video. The RGB inputs were always active and the signal &#x27;punches holes&#x27; in the composite video. This could be used to overlay subtitles from an external Teletext decoder.
*0 V–0.4 V means composite with a transparent RGB overlay.
*1 V–3 V (nominal 1 V) RGB only.

There is no switching signal to indicate S-Video. Some TVs can auto-detect the presence of the S-Video signal but more commonly the S-Video input needs to be manually selected. The same for the rare component YPbPr, which is in many cases implemented over a composite or RGB SCART.

=== Non-standard extensions ===

The use of the data pins was not standardised in the original SCART specification, resulting in the use of several different protocols, both proprietary protocols and semi-proprietary protocols based on standards such as D²B.

Some of the most creative usages appeared in analogue satellite receivers. The function of decoding hybrid, time-compressed analogue-digital MAC transmissions into RGB and analogue audio was akin to making a digital receiver out of an analogue one. The D²B pins (10 and 12) were used for communicating with satellite dish positioners and for driving magnetic polarisers, before these became incorporated into LNBs. The daisy-chaining features were used to connect both a Pay TV decoder and a dish positioner/polariser to a single &quot;Decoder&quot; socket on the receiver.

CENELEC EN 50157-1 introduced AV.link as a standardised protocol to carry advanced control information between devices. It is a single-wire serial data bus and allows carrying remote control information and to negotiate analogue signal types (e.g. RGB). AV.link is also known as nexTViewLink or trade names such as SmartLink, Q-Link or EasyLink. It appears as the Consumer Electronics Control channel in HDMI.

The data pins, 10, 12, 14, were used by some manufacturers for Dolby Pro Logic, surround and multichannel on their TV sets (some high end models with built in Dolby decoders, and external surround speakers, both CRT, LCD and plasma sets, and only in Europe - and European versions of Japanese TV Sets and DVD players -, and mainly on S/PDIF), in order to connect a DVD player to the TV set and stream the Dolby and DTS to the surround of the TV set . However, this protocol was rarely used, as it was limited only to a certain manufacturer, and the connections were different from a manufacturer to another, and in some cases, it was only commanded by the pin 8. In this case, it was unusable with RCA to SCART adapters. Also, if a Compatible TV with such connection and a compatible DVD with such connection, but from different manufacturers were interconnected, the surround might not work, and only the stereo sound from the DVD player was available to the TV, because some manufacturers did not use SPDIF, but an own protocol. Also, this connection might be also lost, if the connection of the DVD with the TV was made indirectly (through a VCR in daisy chaining mode, for example), however, some VCR allowed the pass-through of these signals. Some DVD player manufacturers on some models offered SPDIF only on SCART, and an adapter in order to extract the digital audio signal to send it to a home cinema. To the present day this connection remains rare, as HDMI, S/PDIF, and TOSLINK can provide multichannel audio, also some TV sets with Surround built in may have an Optical or S/PDIF INPUT, beside Output .

== Implementations ==
Nearly all modern DVD players and set-top boxes with SCART sockets can output RGB signal, which offers superior picture quality to composite signal. However, many devices do not have RGB output turned on by default, instead defaulting to composite video: RGB often has to be set up manually in the menu or via switches on the back of the device.

The GameCube, Wii, Neo-Geo, Dreamcast, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox and Xbox 360 can output RGB, component video, S-Video, or composite video. These consoles come with the standard composite video connector, but the manufacturers and third parties sell connectors for component video hookup and for RGB SCART hookup. Where the Nintendo GameCube and Xbox automatically switch to the proper mode, the PlayStation 2 must be told via a selection in the system menu whether it is to use YPBPR or RGB video. RGB is only available on PAL region GameCube and Wii consoles, while S-Video is only available on NTSC consoles.

Some older consoles such as the Master System, Mega Drive/Genesis, and Super Nintendo Entertainment System output RGB, and many older home computers (Amstrad CPC, later ZX Spectrum models, MSX, Amiga, Atari ST, BBC Micro and Acorn Archimedes, etc.) output RGB with composite sync suitable for SCART use, via DIN plugs. Standard-resolution arcade monitors use RGB signals with a composite sync, which is SCART-compatible.

Besides simple connection of external devices to SCART TVs, RGB SCART is used in the retrogaming scene for connecting vintage games consoles (including ones internally modified for RGB or 60 Hz RGB where necessary) to:

*RGB SCART inputs of upscalers / analogue-to-digital converters; these output over HDMI at higher than original resolution, to modern TVs / monitors / projectors / capture cards, or, via further conversion (HDMI to VGA digital-to-analogue) CRT PC monitors

*RGB SCART to RGB BNC adapters and into RGB CRT professional video monitors

*RGB SCART to S-video converters, for achieving the best video quality on a combination of a TV / monitor with S-video as its best input but with a console that cannot output S-video, but can output RGB as its best output

The SAM Coupé microcomputer also uses a SCART connector for its output, however it is a non-standard pinout.

== Japanese RGB 21-pin connector ==

There is also a Japanese version of the SCART connector, which is referred to as the Japanese RGB-21 connector, EIAJ TTC-003, or simply JP-21. This version of SCART uses similar signals and the same connector, but it has a different pinout. In Japan and Korea, it is commonly called RGB-21 while it is more generally called JP-21 in the English-speaking world.

JP-21 was standardised in January 1983 with the norm TTC-0003 published by EIAJ, which was superseded in March 1993 by the norm CPR-1201 to include S-Video. CPR-1201 was withdrawn in March 2003 to be replaced by the equivalent norm CPR-1205, representing Japan&#x27;s transition from analogue to digital, and thus antiquating analogue connectors.

It was adopted in Japan for the connector&#x27;s ability to support RGB output format (no compression nor deterioration of original video signals) but, contrary to SCART in Europe, it never saw widespread use on the consumer market.

When using RGB video, the red channel uses the same pins in both standards, so red video with no audio is indicative of mismatching JP-21 SCART with EuroSCART.

Notes:

* Audio input: 0.40 mVrms, &gt; 47K ohms
* Audio output: 0.40 mVrms, &gt; 10K ohms
* CVBS (composite video) in and out: 1 Vp-p, 75 ohms, sync: negative
* Ym input: Switches RGB to half-brightness, for video overlay (L: &lt; 0.4 V, H: &gt; 1 V, 75 ohms)
* Ys input: RGB in/out: (ground for output, 1 V+ for input (preferred))

<text> () is a French daily morning newspaper founded in 1826. It was named after Figaro, a character in a play by polymath Beaumarchais (1732–1799); one of his lines became the paper&#x27;s motto: &quot;Without the freedom to criticise, there is no flattering praise&quot;.

The oldest national newspaper in France, is considered a French newspaper of record, along with and &quot;Libération&quot;. Since 2004, the newspaper has been owned by Dassault Group. Its editorial director has been Alexis Brézet since 2012. &quot;Le Figaro&quot; is the second-largest national newspaper in France, after &quot;Le Monde&quot;. It has a centre-right editorial stance and is headquartered on Boulevard Haussmann in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. Other Groupe Figaro publications include &quot;Le Figaro Magazine&quot;, &quot;TV Magazine&quot; and &quot;Evene&quot;. The paper is published in Berliner format.

==History==
 was founded as a satirical weekly in 1826, taking its name and motto from &quot;Le Mariage de Figaro&quot;, the 1778 play by Pierre Beaumarchais that poked fun at privilege. Its motto, from Figaro&#x27;s monologue in the play&#x27;s final act, is &quot;Sans la liberté de blâmer, il n&#x27;est point d&#x27;éloge flatteur&quot; (&quot;Without the freedom to criticise, there is no flattering praise&quot;). In 1833, editor Nestor Roqueplan fought a duel with a Colonel Gallois, who was offended by an article in , and was wounded but recovered. Albert Wolff, Émile Zola, Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr, Théophile Gautier, and Jules Arsène Arnaud Claretie were among the paper&#x27;s early contributors. It was published somewhat irregularly until 1854, when it was taken over by Hippolyte de Villemessant.

In 1866, became a daily newspaper. Its first daily edition, that of 16 November 1866, sold 56,000 copies, having highest circulation of any newspaper in France. Its editorial line was royalist. Pauline Savari was among the contributors to the paper at this time.

On 20 February 1909 published a manifesto signed by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti which initiated the establishment of Futurism in art.

On 16 March 1914, Gaston Calmette, the editor of , was assassinated by Henriette Caillaux, the wife of Finance Minister Joseph Caillaux, after he published a letter that cast serious doubt on her husband&#x27;s integrity. In 1922, was purchased by perfume millionaire François Coty. Abel Faivre did cartoons for the paper. Coty enraged many in March 1929 when he renamed the paper simply &quot;Figaro&quot;, which it remained until 1933.

By the start of World War II, had become France&#x27;s leading newspaper. After the war, it became the voice of the upper middle class, and continues to maintain a conservative position.

In 1975, was bought by Robert Hersant&#x27;s Socpresse. In 1999, The Carlyle Group obtained a 40% stake in the paper, which it later sold in March 2002. Since March 2004, has been controlled by Serge Dassault, a conservative businessman and politician best known for running the aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation, which he inherited from his father, its founder, Marcel Dassault (1892–1986). Dassault owns 80% of the paper, by way of its media subsidiary Groupe Figaro.

Franz-Olivier Giesbert was editorial director of &quot;Le Figaro&quot; from 1998 to 2000.

In 2006, was banned in Egypt and Tunisia for publishing articles allegedly insulting Islam.

 switched to Berliner format in 2009. The paper has published &quot;The New York Times International Weekly&quot; on Friday since 2009, an 8-page supplement featuring a selection of articles from &quot;The New York Times&quot; translated into French. In 2010, Lefigaro.fr created a section called Le Figaro in English, which provides the global English-speaking community with daily original or translated content from website. The section ended in 2012.

In the 2010s, saw future presidential candidate Éric Zemmour&#x27;s columns garner great interest among readers that would later serve to launch his political career.

==Editorial stance and controversies==

 has traditionally held a conservative editorial stance, becoming the voice of the French upper and middle classes. More recently, the newspaper&#x27;s political stance has become more centrist.

The newspaper&#x27;s ownership by Serge Dassault was a source of controversy in terms of conflict-of-interest, as Dassault also owned a major military supplier and served in political positions from the Union for a Popular Movement party. His son Olivier Dassault served as a member of the French National Assembly. Dassault has remarked in an interview in 2004 on the public radio station France Inter that &quot;newspapers must promulgate healthy ideas&quot; and that &quot;left-wing ideas are not healthy ideas.&quot;

In February 2012, a general assembly of the newspaper&#x27;s journalists adopted a motion accusing the paper&#x27;s managing editor, Étienne Mougeotte, of having made into the &quot;bulletin&quot; of the governing party, the Union for a Popular Movement, of the government and of President Nicolas Sarkozy. They requested more pluralism and &quot;honesty&quot; and accused the paper of one-sided political reporting. Mougeotte had previously said that would do nothing to embarrass the government and the right. Mougeotte publicly replied: &quot;Our editorial line pleases our readers as it is, it works. I don&#x27;t see why I should change it. [...] We are a right-wing newspaper and we express it clearly, by the way. Our readers know it, our journalists too. There&#x27;s nothing new to that!&quot;

==Circulation history==
In the period of 1995–96, the paper had a circulation of 391,533 copies, behind &quot;Le Parisien&quot;s 451,159 copies.

== Le Figaro Group ==
&quot;Le Figaro&quot; formed the Groupe Figaro (a subsidiary of the Marcel Dassault Industrial Group). The former company, Socpresse, which was dismantled in 2005, officially became Dassault Media (Figaro Group) in 2011.

In July 2021, the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties fined &quot;Le Figaro&quot; €50,000 for installing third-party cookies without users&#x27; consent, in violation of the GDPR.

==== FigaroVox ====
FigaroVox is an online section of &quot;figaro.fr&quot; created in 2014 by Alexis Brézet, a former journalist at &quot;Valeurs actuelles&quot; (from 1987 to 2000), &quot;holding a very right-wing line&quot;, on the advice of Patrick Buisson, a figure associated with Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s shift to the far right in 2012. FigaroVox was an extension of the &quot;debates and opinions&quot; pages of the print daily on Internet; appearing on the homepage of Figaro&#x27;s website, FigaroVox articles accentuated the political character of this daily. The journalists contributing to FigaroVox were positioned at the crossroads of the right, practicing Catholicism, and the &quot;new reactionaries&quot;. FigaroVox was led by Vincent Trémolet de Villers, who co-authored a book on La Manif pour tous (&quot;And France Awoke. An Investigation into the Revolution of Values&quot;). It was edited by Alexandre Devecchio, a former journalist for the site Atlantico. Its contributors included Maxime Tandonnet, a former advisor on immigration to Nicolas Sarkozy, and Gilles-William Goldnadel, an attorney for Patrick Buisson.

FigaroVox&#x27;s preferred themes were &quot;the decline of the republican school, poorly controlled immigration, and Islam as the primary threat to national identity&quot;.

Sociologist Philippe Corcuff considered FigaroVox an &quot;ultraconservative&quot; section. Sociologist Jean-Louis Schlegel of the magazine &quot;Esprit&quot; described it as a platform for &quot;the right of the right&quot;, akin to &quot;Causeur&quot; or &quot;Valeurs actuelles&quot;. Political scientist Eszter Petronella suggested that FigaroVox allowed &quot;Le Figaro&quot; to &quot;balance&quot; the more moderate positions of the print daily by giving voice to an &quot;identitarian and militant journalism,&quot; thereby catering to the needs of all readers. Nolwenn Le Blevennec of Rue89 described it as a . Information science specialist Aurélie Olivesi noted the proximity between the &quot;polemical site&quot; FigaroVox and the magazine &quot;Causeur&quot;, with some journalists having worked for both media. According to &quot;Causeur&quot;, the section opened its doors to authors from both the left and the right. According to Nolwenn Le Blevennec, however, FigaroVox was haunted by an &quot;identitarian obsession,&quot; exhibited an ultra-conservative and sovereignist editorial line, and remained a platform where . Left-wing figures, such as Gaël Brustier, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, and Thomas Guénolé, were invited &quot;sometimes&quot; or more regularly like Laurent Bouvet. Éric Zemmour and Alain Finkielkraut were very appreciated there. According to &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;, the invited authors included liberals and left-wing sovereignists, but in larger numbers were advocates of the &quot;conservative reaction.&quot; These intellectuals and polemicists used the platform to criticize globalization.

Since 2019, the section has been headed by Guillaume Perrault; Alexandre Devecchio, whom &quot;Le Monde&quot; associates with the far right, was its deputy editor. In 2020, the section had six regular columnists, Bertille Bayart, Nicolas Baverez, Renaud Girard, Mathieu Bock-Côté, Luc Ferry, Ivan Rioufol, along with guest contributors.

In partnership with Dargaud Benelux, the newspaper launched in 2010 a 20-volume collection of XIII in a &quot;prestige&quot; edition and a pre-publication of the latest volumes of the series throughout the summer of the same year in &quot;Le Figaro Magazine&quot;. Additionally, the daily also offered a selection of comic books, from Largo Winch to Blake and Mortimer to Gaston, Tintin, Lucky Luke, and Spirou and Fantasio.

<text>Lauderdale County is a county located in the northwestern corner of the U.S. state of Alabama. At the 2020 census the population was 93,564. Its county seat is Florence. Its name is in honor of Colonel James Lauderdale, of Tennessee. Lauderdale is part of the Florence-Muscle Shoals, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area, also known as &quot;The Shoals&quot;.

==History==
Lauderdale County was named in honor of Col. James Lauderdale who was born in Virginia in about 1780. In the early 19th century, Lauderdale, who moved to West Tennessee, became a major in General John Coffee&#x27;s cavalry of volunteers. Later promoted to lieutenant colonel, he commanded a brigade of mounted riflemen, serving under Andrew Jackson. According to reliable historians, Col. Lauderdale did not die in the Battle of New Orleans, but was wounded in the Battle of Talladega and died on December 23, 1814, seventeen days before Jackson&#x27;s decisive defeat of the British at New Orleans. Several towns and counties in the southern states were named in his honor, though it is said that he never set foot in Lauderdale County.

Lauderdale County was established in 1818, a year before Alabama became a state. Florence, the county seat of Lauderdale County, was also established in 1818. At this time a group of investors, under the name of Cypress Land Company purchased from the government of land consisting of the original town site. Other towns in Lauderdale County competing for early settlers because of their proximity to the river were Savage&#x27;s Spring, below Florence and Waterloo, some downriver.

Among the older settlements in the county is Center Star, located between Killen and Rogersville. This area was once claimed by both the Chickasaws and Cherokees, necessitating a cession of territory from each tribe before the settlement could be established. At one time, the remains of an old Indian village could be seen southwest of Center Star. Other old settlements included Middleton and Elgin, the latter known first as Ingram&#x27;s Elgin Cross Roads.

Rogersville, lying some to the east of Florence, was named for John Rogers, an Indian trader, whose sons were fast friends of the great Sam Houston. The late Will Rogers is said to have been a descendant of this same family. An early ferry that operated for many years was Lamb&#x27;s Ferry near Rogersville.

Lexington, Springfield, and Anderson lie to the north of the Lee Highway, the town of Lexington being a part of the territory once claimed by the Cherokee. Many of the settlers of that area came from Tennessee and the Carolinas. The first post office of record at Lexington was on the Loretto Road, north of town, in 1880. Mail at that time was brought in from Loretto, Tennessee, by horseback and carts.

The town of St. Florian was established in 1872 on the Jackson Highway and named by its Catholic founders (of German descent) for their patron saint.

Four Alabama governors were from the county - Hugh McVay, Robert M. Patton, Edward A. O&#x27;Neal and Emmett O&#x27;Neal.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (7.4%) is water. The county&#x27;s entire southern and western boundaries are dictated by the Tennessee River, essentially forming a wedge between the river and the state of Tennessee that even extends past the remainder of the border between Alabama and Mississippi.

<text>Lawrence County is a county in the northern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 33,073. The county seat is Moulton. The county was named after James Lawrence, a captain in the United States Navy from New Jersey.

Lawrence County is included in the Decatur, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Huntsville-Decatur-Albertville, AL Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

For thousands of years, this area was inhabited by differing cultures of indigenous peoples. People of the Copena culture in the Middle Woodland period (1–500 CE) built complex earthworks as part of their religious and political system. Their burial mound and ceremonial platform mound, the largest in the state, are preserved at Oakville Indian Mounds Park and Museum. The museum includes exhibits on the Cherokee, an Iroquoian-speaking people who inhabited the area at the time of European encounter. Other historic Native American tribes in this state were Choctaw and Creek, who both spoke Muskogean languages.

Lawrence County was established by the legislature of the Alabama Territory on February 6, 1818. Under the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the U.S. government forced most of the members of these Southeast tribes to go west of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory to the west. They wanted to extinguish their land claims to open the area to settlement by Americans.

Numerous Cherokee and mixed-race European-Cherokee descendants, sometimes called &quot;Black Dutch&quot;, have stayed in the Lawrence County area. According to the census, the county has the highest number of self-identified Native Americans in the state. The state-recognized Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama has their Blue Clan in this county with 4,000 enrolled members.

==Places of interest==
Lawrence County is home to part of the William B. Bankhead National Forest, Oakville Indian Mounds, Jesse Owens Memorial Park, and Pond Spring, the General Joe Wheeler Home. The Black Warrior Path, which starts in Cullman County, runs through this county and passes the Oakville Indian Mounds. It was used by Native Americans for hundreds of years, and was later used by pioneer settlers.

==Events==
Every year, Lawrence County hosts numerous events, including the AHSAA Cross Country state championships at the Oakville Indian Mounds, the Alabama Multicultural Indian Festival at the Oakville Indian Mounds, the Strawberry Festival in Moulton, and General Joe Wheeler&#x27;s Birthday Party at Pond Spring in Courtland. The cities of Moulton and Courtland each celebrate Christmas on the Square during the month of December.

<text>The Sheldonian Theatre, in the centre of Oxford, England, was built from 1664 to 1669 after a design by Christopher Wren for the University of Oxford. The building is named after Gilbert Sheldon, Warden of All Souls College and later chancellor of the University. Sheldon was the project&#x27;s main financial backer. The theatre is used for music concerts, lectures and University ceremonies, but not for drama until 2015 when the Christ Church Dramatic Society staged a production of &quot;The Crucible&quot; by Arthur Miller.

==History==

What came to be known as the Sheldonian Theatre was Wren&#x27;s second work and was commissioned by Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury. With the triumph of the Restoration and with it the Church of England, Dean Fell, Vice-Chancellor of the University, sought to revive a project proposed in the 1630s by the late William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury: a separate building whose sole use would be graduation and degree ceremonies.

In the past these increasingly rowdy occasions had taken place in the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, in the High Street. &quot;The notion that &#x27;sacrifice is made equally to God and Apollo&#x27;, in the same place where homage was due to God and God alone, was as repugnant to Fell and his colleagues as it had been to Laud&quot;; with this in mind they approached the Archbishop of Canterbury Gilbert Sheldon, for his blessing, his assistance, and a donation.

Sheldon was forthcoming with all three. He initially gave an impressive £1,000 (£ today) and pledged to gather the needed money from like-minded sponsors. He had little luck, however, and ultimately financed nearly the entire £14,470 (£ today) himself, in an age where a mid-level craftsman&#x27;s wage was typically between £2 and £4 per year.

Wren&#x27;s initial designs for the Sheldonian probably included a proscenium stage that did not survive his revisions. The building that was constructed was a sharp, unmistakable break from the Gothic past. According to Wren&#x27;s son, Wren designed the Sheldonian based on Serlio&#x27;s sixteenth-century engraving of the D-shaped Theatre of Marcellus erected in Rome in the first century BC.

Like any Mediterranean theatre of that time, the Theatre of Marcellus had no roof: the audience relied on a temporary awning for inclement weather. But 17th century Oxford was not ancient Rome, and the Theatre needed a permanent roof. The span of the D-shaped roof was over . However, no timbers existed that were long enough to cross that distance, and Wren dismissed the obvious solution of a Gothic roof. Instead, he decided to use the &quot;geometrical flat floor&quot; grid developed twenty years before by Oxford professor John Wallis.

It involved

...creating a series of trusses which were built up from shorter section[s] and held in place by their own weight, with help from judiciously placed iron bolts and plates... [S]o effective [was the roof] that for nearly a century the University Press stored its books... and for many years it was the largest unsupported floor in existence...

In 1720, surveyors inspecting the roof, following a rumour that it was no longer safe, were both surprised and impressed at what they discovered. Though sagging slightly from the massive weight of books, the inspectors pronounced that &quot;...the whole Fabrick of the said Theatre is, in our Opinion, like[ly] to remain and continue in such Repair and Condition, for one hundred or two hundred Years yet to come.&quot;

In November 2008 a four-year project to restore the ceiling fresco was completed. The thirty-two oil on canvas panels originally painted by King Charles II’s court painter, Robert Streater, were removed and conserved. As part of the conservation process, the panels had their linings replaced, holes in the canvas mended, and over-painting removed. The allegorical story depicted in the paintings shows Truth descending upon the Arts and Sciences and expelling ignorance from the University.

In May 2024, during the Israel–Hamas war protests in the United Kingdom, the Sheldonian Theatre played centre stage for Oxford University students, who listed their Gaza demands there, in reaction to civilian deaths. Protesters later blocked the path of graduation ceremonies taking place at the theatre.

==Building==
The building has a prominent eight-sided cupola in the centre of the roof, which is accessible via a staircase leading to the dome over the main ceiling. The cupola has large windows on all sides, providing views across central Oxford, and is open to visitors.

The theatre is used for music recitals, lectures (such as the annual Romanes Lecture), conferences, and for various ceremonies held by the University (such as graduation and matriculation). Handel conducted the first performance of his third oratorio &quot;Athalia&quot; here in 1733. Today, the theatre is home to regular performances by local groups, including the Oxford Philomusica and Stornoway. The latter was the first pop band to play in the space, joined by the student-led Oxford Millennium Orchestra for its first single launch in 2009, then again to celebrate the launch of its third LP, in 2014.

The building seats between 800 and 1000 people and is on the grounds of part of the Bodleian Library adjacent to Broad Street. To the left at the front is the Clarendon Building and to the right is the Old Ashmolean Building. Behind the Sheldonian is the Divinity School.

The theatre is a Grade I listed building which was first added to the list on the 12th January 1954.

The theatre features prominently in Max Beerbohm&#x27;s 1911 novel &quot;Zuleika Dobson&quot; and was used as stand in for Harvard in the 1980 film &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;.

<doc id="80777" wikidata="Q41470" url="?curid=80777" title="Kurdistan">
<text>Kurdistan (, ; ), or Greater Kurdistan, is a roughly defined geo-cultural region in West Asia wherein the Kurds form a prominent majority population and the Kurdish culture, languages, and national identity have historically been based. Geographically, Kurdistan roughly encompasses the northwestern Zagros and the eastern Taurus mountain ranges.

Kurdistan generally comprises the following four regions: southeastern Turkey (Northern Kurdistan), northern Iraq (Southern Kurdistan), northwestern Iran (Eastern Kurdistan), and northern Syria (Western Kurdistan). Some definitions also include parts of southern Transcaucasia. Certain Kurdish nationalist organizations seek to create an independent nation state consisting of some or all of these areas with a Kurdish majority, while others campaign for greater autonomy within the existing national boundaries. The delineation of the region remains disputed and varied, with some maps greatly exaggerating its boundaries.

Historically, the word &quot;Kurdistan&quot; is first attested in 11th century Seljuk chronicles. Many disparate Kurdish dynasties, emirates, principalities, and chiefdoms were established from the 8th to 19th centuries. Administratively, the 20th century saw the establishment of the short-lived areas of the Kurdish state (1918–1919), Kingdom of Kurdistan (1921–1924), Kurdistansky Uyezd i.e. &quot;Red Kurdistan&quot; (1923–1929), Republic of Ararat (1927–1930), and Republic of Mahabad (1946).

In Iraq, following the Aylūl Revolt, the government entered into an agreement with the rebellious Kurds, granting Kurds local self-rule. Soon after, however, the agreement collapsed. Later, during the Iraqi no-fly zones conflict, which followed the Gulf War, the Iraqi military withdrew from parts of northern Iraq, allowing the Kurds to fill the vacuum and regain lost control in those areas. After the invasion of Iraq, and since the creation of the new Iraqi federal state, the new constitution issued in 2005 recognises Kurdistan Region as a federal region; even though the constitution does not include the term “autonomy”, it emphasises decentralisation and devolution, allowing regions and governorates to administer local affairs. In practice, however, only Kurdistan Region has exercised this authority granted by the constitution. In September 2017, Iraqi Kurds held a one-sided independence referendum, which eventually failed and was abandoned. The subsequent effort by the Iraqi government to punish Kurdistan Region has resulted in the latter losing authorities it had previously possessed, and the future of Kurdish autonomy in Iraq has been called into question. Iraqi Kurdish officials have also complained of efforts by the Iraqi government to return to the pre-2003 centralized government and dismantle Kurdistan Region altogether.

There is also a Kurdistan Province in Iran, which is not self-ruled. Kurds fighting in the Syrian civil war were able to take control of large sections of northern Syria and establish self-governing regions in an Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (commonly called Rojava), where they seek autonomy in a federal Syria after the war.

== Etymology and delineation ==
Kurdistan means &quot;Land of the Kurds&quot; and was first attested in 11th-century Seljuk chronicles. The exact origins of the name &quot;Kurd&quot; are unclear. The suffix &quot;-stan&quot; (Persian: ـستان, &quot;stân&quot;) is Persian for land.

&quot;Kurdistan&quot; was also formerly spelled &quot;Curdistan&quot;. One of the ancient names of this region was &quot;Corduene&quot;. The 19th-century Kurdistan Eyalet was the first time that the Ottoman Empire used the term &#x27;Kurdistan&#x27; to refer to an administrative unit rather than a geographical region.

Albeit admitting a thorough delineation is difficult, the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; delineated Kurdistan as following:Many of the maps delineating Kurdistan are greatly exaggerated, also incorporating non-Kurdish regions, which has made the subject very controversial.

== History ==
=== Ancient history ===
Various groups, among them the Guti, Hurrians, Mannai (Mannaeans), and Armenians, lived in this region in antiquity. The original Mannaean homeland was situated east and south of the Lake Urmia, roughly centered around modern-day Mahabad. The region came under Persian rule during the reign of Cyrus the Great and Darius I.

The Kingdom of Corduene, which emerged from the declining Seleucid Empire, was located to the south and south-east of Lake Van between Persia and Mesopotamia and ruled northern Mesopotamia and southeastern Anatolia from 189 BC to AD 384 as vassals of the vying Parthian and Roman empires. Corduene became a vassal state of the Roman Republic in 66 BC and remained allied with the Romans until AD 384. After 66 BC, it passed another 5 times between Rome and Persia. Corduene was situated to the east of Tigranocerta, that is, to the east and south of present-day Diyarbakır in south-eastern Turkey.

Some historians have correlated a connection between Corduene with the modern names of Kurds and Kurdistan; &quot;T. A. Sinclair&quot; and other scholars have dismissed this identification as false, while a common association is asserted in the &quot;Columbia Encyclopedia&quot;.

Some of the ancient districts of Kurdistan and their corresponding modern names:
# Corduene or Gordyene (Siirt, Bitlis and Şırnak)
# Sophene (Diyarbakır)
# Zabdicene or Bezabde (&quot;Gozarto d&#x27;Qardu&quot; or &quot;Jazirat Ibn&quot; or Cizre)
# Basenia (Bayazid)
# Moxoene (Muş)
# Nephercerta (&quot;Miyafarkin&quot;)
# Artemita (Van)

One of the earliest records of the phrase &quot;land of the Kurds&quot; is found in an Assyrian Christian document of late antiquity, describing the stories of Assyrian saints of the Middle East, such as Abdisho. When the Sasanian Marzban asked Mar Abdisho about his place of origin, he replied that according to his parents, they were originally from &quot;Hazza,&quot; a village in Assyria. However, they were later driven out of Hazza by pagans, and settled in &quot;Tamanon,&quot; which according to Abdisho was in the &quot;land of the Kurds.&quot; Tamanon lies just north of the modern Iraq-Turkey border, while Hazza is 12 km southwest of modern Erbil. In another passage in the same document, the region of the Khabur River is also identified as &quot;land of the Kurds&quot;. According to Al-Muqaddasi and Yaqut al-Hamawi, Tamanon was located on the south-western or southern slopes of Mount Judi and south of Cizre. Other geographical references to the Kurds in Syriac sources appear in Zuqnin chronicle, writings of Michael the Syrian and Bar Hebraeus. They mention the mountains of Qardu, city of Qardu and country of Qardawaye.

=== Post-classical history ===


In the tenth and eleventh centuries, several Kurdish principalities emerged in the region: in the north the Shaddadids (951–1174) (in east Transcaucasia between the Kur and Araxes rivers) and the Rawadids (955–1221) (centered on Tabriz and which controlled all of Azerbaijan), in the east the Hasanwayhids (959–1015) (in Zagros between Shahrizor and Khuzistan) and the Annazids (990–1116) (centered in Hulwan) and in the west the Marwanids (990–1096) to the south of Diyarbakır and north of Jazira.

Kurdistan in the Middle Ages was a collection of semi-independent and independent states called emirates. It was nominally under indirect political or religious influence of Khalifs or Shahs. A comprehensive history of these states and their relationship with their neighbors is given in the text of &quot;Sharafnama&quot;, written by Prince Sharaf al-Din Bitlisi in 1597. The emirates included Baban, Soran, Badinan and Garmiyan in the south; Bakran, Bohtan (or Botan) and Badlis in the north, and Mukriyan and Ardalan in the east.

The earliest medieval attestation of the toponym &quot;Kurdistan&quot; is found in a 12th-century Armenian historical text by Matteos Urhayeci. He described a battle near Amid and Siverek in 1062 as to have taken place in &quot;Kurdistan&quot;. The second record occurs in the prayer from the colophon of an Armenian manuscript of the Gospels, written in 1200.

A later use of the term &quot;Kurdistan&quot; is found in Empire of Trebizond documents in 1336 and in &quot;Nuzhat al-Qulub&quot;, written by Hamdallah Mustawfi in 1340.

According to Sharaf al-Din Bitlisi in his Sharafnama, the boundaries of the Kurdish land begin at the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf and stretch on an even line to the end of Malatya and Marash. Evliya Çelebi, who traveled in the region between 1640 and 1655, mentioned that Kurdistan includes Erzurum, Van, Hakkari, Cizre, Imaddiya, Mosul, Shahrizor, Harir, Ardalan, Baghdad, Derne, Derteng, until Basra.

In the 16th century, after prolonged wars, Kurdish-inhabited areas were split between the Safavid and Ottoman empires. A major division of Kurdistan occurred in the aftermath of the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, and was formalized in the 1639 Treaty of Zuhab. In a geography textbook of late Ottoman military school by Ahmet Cevad Kurdistan span over the cities Erzurum, Van, Urfa, Sulaymanyah, Kirkuk, Mosul and Diyarbakir among others and was one out of six regions of Ottoman Asia.

=== Modern history ===
After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Allies contrived to split Kurdistan (as detailed in the ultimately unratified Treaty of Sèvres) among several countries, including Kurdistan, Armenia and others. However, the reconquest of these areas by the forces of Kemal Atatürk (and other pressing issues) caused the Allies to accept the renegotiated Treaty of Lausanne (1923) and the borders of the modern Republic of Turkey, leaving the Kurds without a self-ruled region. Other Kurdish areas were assigned to the new British and French mandated states of Iraq and Syria.
At the San Francisco Peace Conference of 1945, the Kurdish delegation proposed consideration of territory claimed by the Kurds, which encompassed an area extending from the Mediterranean shores near Adana to the shores of the Persian Gulf near Bushehr, and included the Lur inhabited areas of southern Zagros.

The historian Jordi Tejel has identified &quot;Greater Kurdistan&quot; as being one of the &quot;Kurdish myths&quot; that the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria (KDPS) were involved in promoting to Kurds in Syria.

An academic source published by the University of Cambridge has described maps of greater Kurdistan created in the 1940s and forward as: &quot;These maps have become some of the most influential propaganda tools for the Kurdish nationalist discourse. They depict a territorially exaggerated version of the territory of Kurdistan, extending into areas with no majority Kurdish populations. Despite their production with political aims related to specific claims on the demographic and ethnographic structure of the region, and their questionable methodologies, they have become &#x27;Kurdistan in the minds of Kurds&#x27; and the boundaries they indicate have been readily accepted.&quot;

At the end of the 1991 Gulf War, the Coalition established a no-fly zone over northern Iraq to provide humanitarian relief to and safeguard the Kurds who would be subjected to Iraqi air attacks. Amid the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from three northern provinces, Kurdistan Region emerged in 1992 as an autonomous entity inside Iraq with its own local government and parliament.

A 2010 US report, written before the instability in Syria and Iraq that exists as of 2014, attested that &quot;Kurdistan may exist by 2030&quot;. The weakening of the Iraqi state following the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has also presented an opportunity for independence for Iraqi Kurdistan, augmented by Turkey&#x27;s move towards acceptance of such a state although it opposes moves toward Kurdish autonomy in Turkey and Syria.

==== Northern Kurdistan ====

The incorporation into Turkey of the Kurdish-inhabited regions of eastern Anatolia was opposed by many Kurds, and has resulted in a long-running separatist conflict in which tens of thousands of lives have been lost. The region saw several major Kurdish rebellions, including the Koçgiri rebellion of 1920 against the Grand National Assembly, then successive insurrections under the Turkish state, including the 1924 Sheikh Said rebellion, the Republic of Ararat in 1927, and the 1937 Dersim rebellion. All were forcefully put down by the authorities. The region was declared a closed military area from which foreigners were banned between 1925 and 1965.

In an attempt to deny their existence, the Turkish government categorized Kurds as &quot;Mountain Turks&quot; until 1991. The words &quot;Kurds&quot;, &quot;Kurdistan&quot;, or &quot;Kurdish&quot; were officially banned by the Turkish government. Following the military coup of 1980, the Kurdish language was officially prohibited in public and private life. Many people who spoke, published, or sang in Kurdish were arrested and imprisoned. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, political parties that represented Kurdish interests were banned.

In 1983, the Kurdish provinces were included in the state of emergency region, which was placed under martial law in response to the activities of the militant separatist organization the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK). A guerrilla war took place through the 1980s and 1990s in which much of the countryside was evacuated, thousands of Kurdish villages were destroyed by the government, and numerous summary executions were carried out by both sides. Food embargoes were placed on Kurdish villages and towns. Tens of thousands were killed in the violence and hundreds of thousands were forced to leave their homes.

Turkey has historically feared that a Kurdish state in Northern Iraq would encourage and support Kurdish separatists in the adjacent Turkish provinces, and have therefore historically strongly opposed Kurdish independence in Iraq. However, following the chaos in Iraq after the US invasion, Turkey has increasingly worked with the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government. The word &#x27;Kurdistan&#x27;, whether written or spoken, can still lead to detention and prosecution in Turkey. Kurdistan has been characterized as an &quot;international colony&quot; by the scholar Ismail Besikci.

==== Iraqi Kurdistan ====
The successful 2014 Northern Iraq offensive by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), and the resultant weakening of the ability of the Iraqi state to project power at the time, also presented a &quot;golden opportunity&quot; for the Kurds to increase their independence and possibly declare an independent Kurdish state. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, who took more than 80 Turkish persons captive in Mosul during their offensive, is an enemy of Turkey, making Kurdistan useful for Turkey as a buffer state. On 28 June 2014 Hüseyin Çelik, a spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), made comments to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; indicating Turkey&#x27;s readiness to accept an independent Kurdistan in northern Iraq. This became increasingly less likely, however, when in July 2017, the Iraqi government declared victory in the Battle of Mosul against ISIS in the group’s last stronghold in the country. Following this, in September 2017, Iraqi Kurds held a one-sided independence referendum which eventually triggered a military operation wherein the Iraqi government forces attacked the Kurds, defeating them and forcing them to abandon the referendum. A month later, Iraq declared full victory over ISIS and re-established control over all previously occupied territory. Following the Kurds’ failed attempt to achieve independence, the government of Iraq has exacted severe punishment against KRI in a number of punitive measures. Some Kurdish officials in Iraq have described this as evidence of the Iraqi government’s aim to return to a centralised political system and abandon the federal system it adopted in 2005. In a leaked letter published by &quot;Al-Monitor&quot; in September 2023, Masrour Barzani, the prime minister of KRG warned about an imminent collapse of the federal model in Iraq (i.e. a return to centralism) and urged the United States to intervene, saying: &quot;I write to you now at another critical juncture in our history, one that I fear we may have difficulty overcoming. …[W]e are bleeding economically and hemorrhaging politically. For the first time in my tenure as prime minister, I hold grave concerns that this dishonorable campaign against us may cause the collapse of … the very model of a Federal Iraq that the United States sponsored in 2003 and purported to stand by since.&quot; According to a report published in 2024 by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Kurdistan Region&#x27;s autonomy &quot;hangs in the balance&quot; due to several punitive measures imposed against the former by the government of Iraq in an effort to punish it and ultimately strip it completely of its autonomy.

==== Syrian Civil War ====

Various sources have reported that Al-Nusra has issued a fatwā calling for Kurdish women and children in Syria to be killed, and the fighting in Syria has led tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Iraq&#x27;s Kurdistan region. As of 2015, Turkey was actively supporting Al-Nusra, but as of January 2017, Turkey&#x27;s foreign ministry has said that Al-Nusra is a terrorist group and has acted accordingly.

== People ==

According to 2016 estimate Kurdish Institute of Paris, total population of Kurdistan is around 34.5 million, and Kurds making 86% of population of Northern Kurdistan. There are Arab, Turkic, Assyrian (Syriac), Armenian and Azerbaijani minorities in Northern Kurdistan. In Southern Kurdistan there are Christian (Assyrian and Armenian) and Turkish (Turkmen) minorities as well. Iraqi and Syrian Turkmen share close ties with Turkish people and do not identify with the Turkmen of Turkmenistan and Central Asia. Kurdistan has also significant Caucasian population, Caucasians of Kurdistan included Chechens and Ingushes in Varto, Ossetians in Ahlat and Circassians. From early stage on, these Caucasians went through a process of Kurdification and thereby had Kurdish as their mother tongue.

== Geography ==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Kurdistan covers about 190,000 km2 (or 73,000 square miles), and its chief towns are Diyarbakır (Amed), Bitlis (Bedlîs) and Van (Wan) in Turkey, Erbil (Hewlêr) and Sulaymaniyah in Iraq, and Kermanshah (Kirmanşan), Sanandaj (Sine), Ilam and Mahabad (Mehabad) in Iran. According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, Kurdistan covers around in Turkey, in Iran, in Iraq, and in Syria, with a total area of approximately .

Turkish Kurdistan encompasses a large area of Eastern Anatolia Region and southeastern Anatolia of Turkey and it is home to an estimated 6 to 8 million Kurds.

=== Subdivisions (Upper and Lower Kurdistan) ===
In &quot;A Dictionary of Scripture Geography&quot; (published 1846), John Miles describes Upper and Lower Kurdistan as following:

The northern, northwestern and northeastern parts of Kurdistan are referred to as upper Kurdistan, and includes the areas from west of Amed to Lake Urmia.

The lowlands of southern Kurdistan are called lower Kurdistan. The main cities in this area are Kirkuk and Arbil.

=== Climate ===
Much of the region is typified by a continental climate – hot in the summer, cold in the winter. Despite this, much of the region is fertile and has historically exported grain and livestock. Precipitation varies between 200 and 400 mm a year in the plains, and between 700 and 3,000 mm a year on the high plateau between mountain chains. The mountainous zone along the borders with Iran and Turkey experiences dry summers, rainy and sometimes snowy winters, and damp springs, while to the south the climate progressively transitions toward semi-arid and desert zones.

=== Flora and fauna===
Kurdistan is one of the most mountainous regions in the world with a cold climate receiving annual precipitation adequate to sustain temperate forests and shrubs. Mountain chains harbor pastures and forested valleys, totaling approximately 16 million hectares (160,000 km2), including firs and countryside is mostly oaks, conifers, platanus, willow, poplar and, to the west of Kurdistan, olive trees.

The region north of the mountainous region on the border with Iran and Turkey features meadow grasses and such wild trees as, Abies cilicica, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus calliprinos, Quercus brantii, Quercus infectoria, Quercus ithaburensis, Quercus macranthera, Cupressus sempervirens, Platanus orientalis, Pinus brutia, Juniperus foetidissima, Juniperus excelsa, Juniperus oxycedrus, Prunus cerasus, Salix alba, Fraxinus excelsior, Paliurus spina-christi, Olea europaea, Ficus carica, Populus euphratica, Populus nigra, Crataegus monogyna, Crataegus azarolus, Prunus cerasifera, rose hips, Cercis siliquastrum, pistachio trees, pear and Sorbus graeca. The desert in the south is mostly steppe and would feature xeric plants such as palm trees, tamarix, date palm, fraxinus, poa, white wormwood and chenopodiaceae. The steppe and desert in the south, by contrast, have such species as palm trees and date palm.

Animals found in the region include the Syrian brown bear, wild boar, gray wolf, the golden jackal, Indian crested porcupine, the red fox, goitered gazelle, Eurasian otter, striped hyena, Persian fallow deer, long-eared hedgehog, onager, mangar and the Euphrates softshell turtle. Birds include, the hooded crow, common starling, Eurasian magpie, European robin, water pipit, spotted flycatcher, namaqua dove, saker falcon, griffon vulture, little crake and collared pratincole, among others.

=== Mountains ===
Mountains are important geographical and symbolic features of Kurdish life, as evidenced by the saying &quot;Kurds have no friends but the mountains.&quot; Mountains are regarded as sacred by the Kurds. Included in the region are Mount Judi and Ararat (both prominent in Kurdish folklore), Zagros, Qandil, Shingal, Mount Abdulaziz, Kurd Mountains, Jabal al-Akrad, Shaho, Gabar, Hamrin, and Nisir.

=== Water resources ===
Iraqi Kurdistan is a region relatively rich in water, especially for countries in the Middle East region. It is the source for much of the water supply for neighboring countries. It means that political stability and peace in the region are important to the water supply of the region and preventing wars. Many think that for conserving the water &quot;returning to traditional water-conserving cultivation techniques&quot; will be needed, as well as &quot;communal economy&quot;

Rivers

The plateaus and mountains of Kurdistan, which are characterized by heavy rain and snow fall, act as a water reservoir for the Near and Middle East, forming the source of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, as well as other numerous smaller rivers, such as the Little Khabur, Khabur, Tharthar, Ceyhan, Araxes, Kura, Sefidrud, Karkha, and Hezil. Among rivers of historical importance to Kurds are the Murat (Arasān) and Buhtān rivers in Turkey; the Peshkhābur, the Little Zab, the Great Zab, and the Diyala in Iraq; and the Jaghatu (Zarrinarud), the Tātā&#x27;u (Siminarud), the Zohāb (Zahāb), and the Gāmāsiyāb in Iran.

These rivers, which flow from heights of three to four thousand meters above sea level, are significant both as water sources and for the production of energy. Iraq and Syria dammed many of these rivers and their tributaries. Turkey has an extensive dam system under construction as part of the GAP (Southeast Anatolia Project); though incomplete, the GAP already supplies a significant proportion of Turkey&#x27;s electrical energy needs. Due to the extraordinary archaeological richness of the region, almost any dam impacts historic sites. With the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, Turkey was accused of withholding water from the reservoir Lake Assad in Syria, while filling the Atatürk dam in Turkey.

Lakes

Kurdistan extends to Lake Urmia in Iran on the east. The region includes Lake Van, the largest body of water in Turkey; the only lake in the Middle East with a larger surface is Lake Urmia – though not nearly as deep as Lake Van, which has a much larger volume. Urmia, Van, as well as Zarivar Lake west of Marivan, and Lake Dukan near the city of Sulaymaniyah, are frequented by tourists.

=== Petroleum and mineral resources ===
Kurdistan Region is estimated to contain around of oil, making it the sixth largest reserve in the world. Extraction of these reserves began in 2007.

Al-Hasakah province, also known as Jazira region, has geopolitical importance of oil and is suitable for agricultural lands.

In November 2011, Exxon challenged the Iraqi central government&#x27;s authority with the signing of oil and gas contracts for exploration rights to six parcels of land in Kurdistan, including one contract in the disputed territories, just east of the Kirkuk mega-field. This act caused Baghdad to threaten to revoke Exxon&#x27;s contract in its southern fields, most notably the West-Qurna Phase 1 project. Exxon responded by announcing its intention to leave the West-Qurna project.

As of July 2007, the Kurdish government solicited foreign companies to invest in 40 new oil sites, with the hope of increasing regional oil production over the following five years by a factor of five, to about . Gas and associated gas reserves are in excess of . Notable companies active in Kurdistan include ExxonMobil, Total, Chevron, Talisman Energy, Genel Energy, Hunt Oil, Gulf Keystone Petroleum, and Marathon Oil.

Other mineral resources that exist in significant quantities in the region include coal, copper, gold, iron, limestone (which is used to produce cement), marble, and zinc. The world&#x27;s largest deposit of rock sulfur is located just southwest of Erbil.

In July 2012, Turkey and the Kurdistan Region signed an agreement by which Turkey would regularly supply the KRG with refined petroleum products in exchange for crude oil.

==History==
=== 19th century ===
Lee County was established by the State Legislature on December 5, 1866, comprising parts of Macon, Tallapoosa, Chambers, and Russell counties. In an election to determine the county seat, Opelika was chosen over Auburn and Salem. 

=== 20th century ===
In 1923, Phenix City, located in the southeastern corner of Lee County, merged with the town of Girard, located in the northeastern corner of Russell County. To prevent the new town of Phenix City from straddling the Lee-Russell line, Lee County ceded to Russell County the in the southeastern corner surrounding Phenix City in exchange for in the northwest corner of Russell County surrounding the unincorporated community of Marvyn. This territory is what forms the southern &quot;panhandle&quot; of Lee County. Even after the land swap with Russell County, however, the city limits of present-day Phenix City stretch into the southeastern corner of Lee.

==Government==
Among the principal governmental functions vested in Alabama counties are law enforcement; tax assessment, levy and collection; administration of decedent&#x27;s estates and probate matters; maintenance of real and personal property title records; construction and maintenance of public roads and bridges; and maintenance of the county courthouse, which provides office space for various county officials and departments. Lee County is one of only seven counties in Alabama that has been granted limited home rule. It is governed by a six-member county commission, composed of the Probate Judge and five commissioners. The Probate Judge is elected countywide for a six-year term and serves as chairman of the commission. The other commissioners are elected from single-member districts for four-year terms. Each commissioner must be a registered voter and live within the district they represent. Terms are staggered so that three commissioners are elected in one election cycle, and the other two members are elected in the next election cycle two years later.

The County Commission employs a County Administrator, who serves as its chief administrative officer. It is the responsibility of the County Administrator to carry out the policies and directives of the commission, and for the development and management of the county&#x27;s annual operating budget. The Administrator serves as the budgetary agent for all county offices. The County Administrator is also responsible for the supervision and management of various department heads, and for ensuring that all agreements, leases and other contractual obligations of the commission are properly performed. The County Administrator works with Lee County Commissioners and other elected county officials to facilitate the delivery of quality and effective services to the citizens of Lee County.

Lee County is very conservative for a county dominated by a college town. While other such counties have swung heavily to the Democrats since the 1990s, Lee County has not supported a Democrat for president since 1960. The last Democrat to garner over 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote was Jimmy Carter in both of his election campaigns in 1976 and 1980. However, Bill Clinton tallied over 38 percent of the county&#x27;s vote in both of his successful runs for president, as did Barack Obama in both of his campaigns.

==Government and politics==
Limestone County comprises the Thirty-Ninth Judicial Circuit of Alabama. The Thirty-Ninth Judicial Circuit was created in the early 1980s when Limestone County broke away from Morgan County to form its own circuit.

The Thirty-Ninth Judicial Circuit has two circuit judges and two district judges. The two circuit judges are Judge Robert M. Baker and Judge B. Chadwick Wise. The two district judges are Judge Matthew R. Huggins and Judge R. Gray West.

The current District Attorney is Brian C.T. Jones.

The current Sheriff of Limestone County is Joshua McLaughlin. The term for sheriffs is four years, and there is no term limit.

Collin Daly (R) is the Chairman of the County Commission.

Limestone County is reliably Republican at the presidential level. The last Democrat to win the county in a presidential election is Jimmy Carter, who won it by an absolute majority in 1980.

<text>The Ariane 4 was a European expendable launch vehicle, developed by the (CNES), the French space agency, for the European Space Agency (ESA). The manufacturing of the launch vehicle was led by Aérospatiale and it was marketed by Arianespace. Since its first flight on 15 June 1988 until the final flight on 15 February 2003, it attained 113 successful launches out of 116 total launches.

In 1982, the Ariane 4 program was approved by ESA. Drawing heavily upon the preceding Ariane 3, it was designed to provide a launcher capable of delivering heavier payloads and at a lower cost per kilogram than the earlier members of the Ariane family. The Ariane 4 was principally an evolution of the existing technologies used, as opposed to being revolutionary in its design ethos; this approach quickly gained the backing of most ESA members, who funded and participated in its development and operation. Capable of being equipped with a wide variety of strap-on boosters, the Ariane 4 gained a reputation for being an extremely versatile launcher.

Once in service, the launcher soon became recognized for being ideal for launching communications and Earth observation satellites, as well as those used for scientific research. During its working life, the Ariane 4 managed to capture 50% of the market in launching commercial satellites, soundly demonstrating Europe&#x27;s ability to compete in the commercial launch sector. In February 2003, the final Ariane 4 was launched; Arianespace had decided to retire the type in favour of the newer and larger Ariane 5, which effectively replaced it in service.

== Development ==
=== Origins ===
In 1973, eleven nations decided to pursue joint collaboration in the field of space exploration and formed a new pan-national organisation to undertake this mission, the European Space Agency (ESA). Six years later, in December 1979, the arrival of a capable European expendable launch system was marked when the first Ariane 1 launcher was successfully launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG) at Kourou, French Guiana. The Ariane 1 soon became considered to be a capable and competitive launcher in comparison to rival platforms offered by the Soviet Union and the United States of America, and it was quickly followed by improved derivatives in the form of the Ariane 2 and Ariane 3. By early 1986, the Ariane 1, along with the Ariane 2 and Ariane 3, had become the dominant launcher on the world market.

In January 1982, the ESA issued its authorisation for the development and construction of the Ariane 4; the development programme had the stated objective of increasing the usable payload by 90%. The Ariane 4 would be a considerably larger and more flexible launcher that the earlier members of its family, being intended to compete with the upper end of launchers worldwide. In comparison, while the Ariane 1 had a typical weight of and could launch payloads of up to into orbit; the larger Ariane 4 had a typical weight of and could orbit payloads of up to . Work on the Ariane 4 was substantially eased via drawing heavily on both the technology and experiences gained from producing and operating the earlier members of the Ariane rocket. The total development cost for the Ariane 4 was valued at 476 million European Currency Units (ECU) in 1986.

Posed with the requirement to produce a rocket with substantially greater thrust, the design team considered various approaches to achieve this. One concept studied had involved the addition of a fifth engine to an enlarged first stage of the Ariane 3, but was found to involve a very high level of redesign work to achieve this; instead, the first stage was elongated to hold of propellant instead of the present on the Ariane 3. While the second and third stages remained identical to the Ariane 3, a range of strap-on boosters were developed to be applied to the type, designed to gradually increase the rocket&#x27;s payload capacity. Overall, the Ariane 4 was 15% smaller than the Ariane 3.

In effect, the Ariane 4 was an improved and developed derivative of the earlier Ariane 3, primarily differing through the application of various solid-fuelled and liquid-fuelled boosters, the latter being the only all-new design feature of the Ariane 4; at this point, the practice of using liquid boosters was uncommon, having only previously been used in the Chinese space program. Another innovation of the Ariane 4 was the dual-launch SPELDA (Structure Porteuse Externe de Lancement Double Ariane) fairing. This had the function of allowing a pair of satellites, one placed on top of the other; several different SPELDA nose fairings could be installed, including normal and extended models. The SPELDA was considerably lighter than its predecessor; the guidance system also used much more accurate ring laser gyroscopes. According to aviation author Brian Harvey, the advances present in the design of the Ariane 4 represented a conservative and evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, philosophy.

=== Teaming and construction ===
As the Ariane 4 programme took shape, it gained the support of Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, and Switzerland. The main contractors were Aérospatiale (responsible for the first and second stages), Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) (produced the liquid-fuelled boosters), Société Européenne de Propulsion (SEP) (engine manufacturer), Matra (equipment bay assembly), Air Liquide (production of third stage tanks and insulation), BPD Snia (maker of solid-fuelled boosters), and British Aerospace/Contraves Space AG (manufacturers of the fairing). For their work on the Ariane 4, the Launch Team were subsequently awarded the Space Achievement Award by the Space Foundation in 2004.

In conjunction with the development of the Ariane 4 itself, a new purpose-built launch preparation area and launch pad for the rocket, collectively designated as &quot;ELA-2&quot;, was constructed at the Centre Spatial Guyanais to service the Ariane 4 and provide a launch rate of 8 launches per year (this feat was near-unprecedented for a single large rocket, other than within the Soviet Union). Unlike the earlier &quot;ELA-1&quot; which had been used for the previous members of the Ariane family and other rockets, preparation activity for the rocket would be performed in a purpose-built tall hall rather than on the pad itself; the completed rocket was then transported using a specially-designed railway to slowly traverse from the hall to the launch pad, taking one hour. This railway provided the additional benefit of enabling faulty rockets to be withdrawn from the pad and be substituted for relatively quickly.

On 15 June 1988, the first successful launch of the Ariane 4 was conducted. For this first test flight, it was decided to fire the second most powerful version of the rocket, designated &quot;44LP&quot;, equipped with four main engines, two solid boosters and two liquid boosters; it was also furnished with the multi-satellite SPELDA fairing. 50 seconds after take-off, the solid boosters would be expended and be detached in order to reduce the rocket&#x27;s weight. 143 seconds after take-off, the liquid boosters also detached, further lightening the vehicle. The maiden flight was considered a success, putting multiple satellites into orbit.

=== Further development ===
For the V50 launch onwards, an improved third stage, known as the &quot;H10+&quot;, was adopted for the Ariane 4. The H10+ third stage featured a new tank, which was lighter, longer, and contained more fuel, which raised the rocket&#x27;s overall payload capacity by and increased its burn time by 20 seconds.

Even prior to the first flight of the Ariane 4, development of a successor, designated as the Ariane 5, had already commenced. In January 1985, the Ariane 5 had been officially adopted as an ESA programme. It lacked the high levels of commonality that the Ariane 4 had with its predecessors, and had been designed not only for launching heavier payloads of up to and at a 20% cost reduction over the Ariane 4, but for a higher margin of safety due to the fact that the Ariane 5 was designed to conduct crewed space launches as well, being intended to transport astronauts using the proposed Hermes space vehicle. Development of the Ariane 5 was not without controversy as some ESA members considered the more mature Ariane 4 to be more suited for meeting established needs for such launchers; it was for this reason that Britain chose not to participate in the Ariane 5 programme. For some years, Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 launchers were operated interchangeably; however, it was eventually decided to terminate all Ariane 4 operations in favour of concentrating on the newer Ariane 5.

== Design ==
The Ariane 4 was the ultimate development from the preceding members of the Ariane rocket family. Compared with the Ariane 2 and Ariane 3, the Ariane 4 featured a stretched first (by 61%) and third stages, a strengthened structure, new propulsion bay layouts, new avionics, and the SPELDA (&quot;Structure Porteuse Externe de Lancement Double Ariane&quot;) dual-payload carrier. The basic 40 version did not employ any strap-on motors, while the Ariane 42L, 44L, 42P, 44P, and 44LP variants all used various combinations of solid and liquid boosters. Originally designed to place payloads in geostationary orbit, the six Ariane 4 variants, aided by strap-on boosters, enabled the launch of payloads in excess of on several occasions. The Ariane 4 launcher reduced the launch costs per kilo by 55% in comparison to the original Ariane 1.

The rocket was used in a number of variants - it could be fitted with two or four additional solid (PAP for &quot;Propulseurs d&#x27;Appoint à Poudre&quot;) or liquid fueled booster rockets (PAL for &quot;Propulseurs d&#x27;Appoint à Liquide&quot;). The launcher included a satellite payload carrier system called &quot;SPELDA&quot; (&quot;Structure porteuse externe de lancement double Ariane&quot;, French for &quot;External Carrying Structure for Ariane Double Launches&quot;) for launching more than one satellite at a time. The rocket captured nearly 60% of the world&#x27;s commercial launch services market, serving both European and international clients. Atop the third stage was a vehicle equipment stage which housed a computer that performed various functions, including sequencing, guidance, control, tracking, telemetry and an explosive-based self-destruct.

The Ariane 4 AR 40 was the basic version, with three stages: high, a diameter of , a liftoff mass of and a maximum payload of to GTO or to low Earth orbit (LEO). Main power was provided by four Viking 2B motors, each producing of thrust. The second stage was powered by a single Viking 4B motor, and the third stage was equipped with an HM7-B liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen motor. The Ariane 4 AR 44L, which was outfitted with the maximum additional boost of four liquid fuel rocket strap-ons, was a four-stage rocket, weighing and capable of transferring a payload of to GTO, or alternatively to LEO.

== Operational history ==
In June 1988, the inaugural flight of the Ariane 4 occurred, which was a success. Since then, Ariane 4 has flown 116 times, 113 of which were successful, yielding a success rate of . 

On 22 February 1990, the first failure occurred during the eighth Ariane 4 launch, flight V36. The rocket exploded 9 km above Kourou. The failure occurred because a worker assembling a Viking rocket motor had left a handkerchief in one of the motor&#x27;s coolant tubes. He had done so as a reminder to himself to inform his superior, as per procedure, of an unplanned polishing he had made to fit the tube. But he fell ill before he could do so and was replaced by other workers who did not notice the handkerchief. In flight, the handkerchief blocked the coolant tube, the motor overheated and failed, and the Ariane self-destructed after veering off its trajectory. Its payload, two communications satellites worth 500 million US dollars (Superbird-B and BS-2X) landed in pieces in the swamps near Kourou. The ensuing investigation recommended 44 modifications, including numbering and checking all pieces of cloth used in the rocket&#x27;s assembly. The following 26 launches were all completed successfully.

The system became the basis for European satellite launches with a record of 113 successful and three launch failures. Ariane 4 provided a payload increase from for Ariane 3 to a maximum of to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). The record for Ariane 4 to GTO was .

On 15 February 2003, the final launch of Ariane 4 rocket occurred, placing Intelsat 907 into geosynchronous orbit. Arianespace had decided to phase out the Ariane 4 launcher in favour of the newer heavy-lift Ariane 5 rocket, which had already been in service for some years. In 2011, the medium-lift Soyuz ST complemented the offering of launch vehicles from the Centre Spatial Guyanais. Spacecraft launched by the Soyuz reused the payload platform and dispenser which had been originally designed for the Ariane.

<doc id="80782" wikidata="Q503461" url="?curid=80782" title="Lowndes County, Alabama">
<text>Lowndes County is in the central part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the county&#x27;s population was 10,311. Its county seat is Hayneville. The county is named in honor of William Lowndes, a member of the United States Congress from South Carolina.

Lowndes County is part of the Montgomery, Alabama Metropolitan Statistical Area. Historically it has been considered part of the Black Belt, known for its fertile soil, cotton plantations, and a high number of African American workers, enslaved and later freed.

==History==
Lowndes County was formed from Montgomery, Dallas and Butler counties, by an act of the Alabama General Assembly on January 20, 1830. The county is named for South Carolina statesman William Lowndes. It is part of the Black Belt, where cotton plantations were developed in the antebellum years and agriculture continued as a dominant part of the economy into the 20th century.

During the Reconstruction era, blacks were elected to local and state offices. White Democrats regained power and control of the state legislature in 1874 and drove the remaining office holders out. They adopted the 1875 Constitution of Alabama and another in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. Requirements were added for payment of a cumulative poll tax before registering to vote, difficult for poor people to manage who often had no cash on hand; and literacy tests (with a provision for a grandfather clause to exempt illiterate white voters from being excluded.) The number of black voters on the rolls fell dramatically in the next few years, as did the number of poor white voters.

From the end of the 19th through the early decades of the 20th centuries, organized white violence increased against blacks, with 16 lynchings recorded in the county, the fourth-highest total in the state, which historically is among those in the South with the highest per capita rate of lynchings. Most victims were black men, subjected to white extra-legal efforts to maintain white supremacy by racial terrorism. Seven of these murders were committed in Letohatchee, an unincorporated community south of Montgomery; five in 1900 and two in 1917. In 1900 mobs killed a black man accused of killing a white man. When local black resident Jim Cross objected, he was killed, too, at his house, followed by his wife, son and daughter. In 1917 two black brothers were killed by a white mob for alleged &quot;insolence&quot; to a white farmer on the road. On July 31, 2016, a historical marker was erected at Letohatchee by the Equal Justice Initiative in coordination with the city to commemorate the people who had suffered these extrajudicial executions.

Because of the shift in agriculture and the Great Migration of blacks to leave oppressive conditions, population in the rural county has declined by two thirds since the 1900 high of more than 35,000. The effects of farm mechanization and the boll weevil infestation, which decimated the cotton crops and reduced the need for farm labor in the 1920s and 1930s, caused widespread loss of jobs.

===Civil Rights Era===
By 1960 (as shown on census tables below), the population had declined to about 15,000 residents and was about 80 percent-majority black. The rural county was referred to as &quot;Bloody Lowndes&quot;, the rusty buckle of Alabama&#x27;s Black Belt, because of the high rate of white violence against blacks to maintain segregation. In 1965, a century after the American Civil War and decades after whites had disenfranchised blacks via the 1901 state constitution, they maintained white supremacy by intimidation and violence, suppressing black voting.

County population had fallen by more than half from its 1900 high, as both blacks and whites moved to urban areas. Blacks still outnumbered whites by a 4-to-1 ratio. Eighty-six white families owned 90 percent of the land in the county and controlled the government, as whites had since 1901. With an economy based on agriculture, black residents worked mostly in low-level rural jobs. In the civil rights era, not one black resident was registered to vote before March 1, 1965.

The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in August of that year encouraged civil rights leaders to believe they could fight racism in Lowndes. The Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO) was founded in the county as a new, independent political party designed to help blacks stand up to intimidation and murder.

Organized by the young civil rights leader Stokely Carmichael of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), in the summer of 1965 Lowndes residents launched an intensive effort to register blacks in the county to vote. SNCC&#x27;s plan was simple: to get enough black people to vote so blacks might be fully represented in the local government and redirect services to black residents, 80 percent of whom lived below the poverty line. Carmichael and others organized registration drives, demonstrations, and political education classes in support of the black residents. The Voting Rights Act authorized the federal government to oversee voter registration and voting processes in places such as Lowndes County where substantial minorities were historically under-represented.

The police continued to arrest protesters in the summer of 1965. A group of protesters were released from jail in the county seat of Hayneville on August 20, 1965. As four of them approached a small store, Thomas Coleman, an unpaid special deputy, ordered them away. When he aimed his shotgun at one of the young black women (Ruby Sales) Jonathan Myrick Daniels pushed her down, taking the blast, which immediately killed the Episcopal seminarian. Coleman also shot Father Richard Morrisroe, a Catholic priest, in the back, then stopped. He was indicted for the murder of Daniels; and an all-white jury quickly acquitted him after his claim of self-defense, although both men were unarmed. Coleman had been appointed as special deputy by the county sheriff.

In 1966 after working to register African-American voters, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO), the first independent black political party in the county since Reconstruction, recruited several local residents as candidates for county offices. It adopted the emblem of the black panther, in contrast to the white rooster of the white-dominated Alabama Democratic Party. On May 3, 1966, over 900 registered black voters cast their ballots at the county seat in Hayneville as independent participants in the primary, with some driving over 25 miles to do so. One notable strategy the LCFO encouraged among black voters was to help other black voters if they needed assistance as a precaution against the fact that &quot;the Lowndes County Freedom Organization knew that once a local white person got behind the curtain with a black person, that vote would be lost&quot; (p. 111). Another was to encourage black voters to simply pull the lever to vote strictly for LCFO candidates; in other words, to &quot;pull the lever for the Black Panther and go on home,&quot; as stated on a sign on Highway U.S. 80 between Montgomery and Selma.

Whites in Lowndes County reacted strongly against the LCFO. In retaliation for black sharecroppers engaging in civil rights work, white landowners evicted many of them from their rental houses and land plots. They used economic blackmail to make them both homeless and unemployed in a struggling economy. The SNCC and Lowndes County leaders worked to help these families stay together and remain in the county. They bought tents, cots, heaters, food, and water and helped several families build a temporary &quot;tent city&quot;. Despite harassment, including shots regularly fired into the encampment, these black residents persevered for nearly two years as organizers helped them find new jobs and look for permanent housing.

Whites refused to serve known LCFO members in stores and restaurants. Several small riots broke out over the issue. The LCFO pushed forward and continued to organize and register voters. However, none of their candidates won in the November 1966 general election. In a December 1966 edition of &quot;The Liberator&quot;, a Black Power magazine, activist Gwendolyn Patton alleged the election had been subverted by widespread ballot fraud. But historians believe that black sharecroppers refrained from voting, submitting to the severe pressure put on them by the local white plantation owners, who employed most of them. After the LCFO folded into the statewide Democratic Party in 1970, African Americans have supported candidates who have won election to local offices. In a continuing divide, since the late 20th century, most white conservative voters in Alabama have shifted to the Republican Party.

In &quot;White v. Crook&quot; (1966), Federal District Judge Frank M. Johnson ruled in a class action suit brought on behalf of black residents of Lowndes County, who demonstrated they had been excluded from juries. Women of all races were excluded from juries by state statute. Johnson ordered that the state of Alabama must take action to recruit both male and female blacks to serve on juries, as well as other women, according to their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The suit was joined by other class members from other counties who dealt with similar conditions of exclusion from juries. It was &quot;one of the first civil actions brought to remedy systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service generally.&quot;

The LCFO continued to fight for wider political participation. Their goal of democratic, community control of politics spread into the wider civil rights movement. The first black sheriff in the county to be elected since Reconstruction was John Hullett, elected in 1970.

Today an Interpretive Center in the county, maintained by the National Park Service, memorializes the Tent City and LCFO efforts in political organizing.

==Government==
Like all of the Black Belt, Lowndes County is powerfully Democratic. The only Republican to carry the county since 1900 was Barry Goldwater in 1964. In that year, most of the county&#x27;s black majority was still prevented from voting. Opposition by the voting white minority to civil rights had resulted in the national Democratic candidate, Lyndon Johnson, being excluded from the ballot in the state.

Even after congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, black registration was so slow that segregationist George Wallace comfortably carried the county in 1968. Since then, the Democratic presidential candidate has carried Lowndes in every election. In 1972, Lowndes was one of six former Wallace counties to vote for George McGovern in 1972 against Richard Nixon&#x27;s 3,000-plus-county landslide.

As of 2014, Lowndes County has a five-member county commission, elected from single-member districts. The county sheriff is elected as well.

<text>Macon County is a county located in the east central part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 19,532. Its county seat is Tuskegee. Its name is in honor of Nathaniel Macon, a member of the United States Senate from North Carolina.

Developed for cotton plantation agriculture in the nineteenth century, the county is considered within the Black Belt of the South. It has had a majority-black population since before the American Civil War.

==History==
For thousands of years, this area was inhabited by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic tribes encountered by European explorers were the Creek people, descendants of the Mississippian culture.

Macon County was established by European Americans on December 18, 1832, from land ceded by the Creek, following the US Congress&#x27; passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. The Creek were removed to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. The new settlers brought slaves with them from eastern areas of the South or purchased them at the slave market in Montgomery, New Orleans or Mobile. They developed the county for large cotton plantations.

In the first half of the twentieth century, thousands of African-Americans migrated out of the county to industrial cities in the North and Midwest for job opportunities, and the chance to escape legal segregation. Those who remained have struggled for employment in the mostly rural county, and population has declined by about one-third since 1950.

Before 1983, Macon County was primarily known as the home of historic Tuskegee Institute, now Tuskegee University, and its noted founder and first president, Booker T. Washington.

==Government==
Macon County has been overwhelmingly Democratic for most of the past century and a quarter. Apart from the &quot;dealignment&quot; era between 1948 and 1972, and Herbert Hoover in the highly controversial 1928 election, no Republican has won so much as twenty percent of the county&#x27;s vote in the past century. No Republican has obtained a majority in that time span, although Dwight D. Eisenhower won a narrow plurality in 1956.

In the elections of 1980, Macon was the most Democratic county in the nation while in 1984 it was the most Democratic outside of the District of Columbia. Macon County was only 0.02 percent shy of this in 1992, when it gave both George H. W. Bush his smallest proportion outside of the District of Columbia and independent Ross Perot his smallest vote share in any county nationwide.













The Sheriff of Macon County is Andre Brunson, who also was the former strength coach at Tuskegee University.

<text>Madison County is a county located in the north central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 388,153, and according to a 2023 population estimate the county has become the second-most populous county in Alabama. Its county seat is Huntsville. Since the mid-20th century it has become an area of defense and space research and industry. The county is named in honor of James Madison, fourth President of the United States and the first President to visit the state of Alabama. Madison County covers parts of the former Decatur County. Madison County is included in the Huntsville, Alabama Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Madison County was established on December 13, 1808, by the governor of the Mississippi Territory. It is recognized as the &quot;birthplace&quot; of the state of Alabama, which was admitted to the Union on December 14, 1819. Huntsville was designated as the first capital of the new state.

For much of the county&#x27;s history, its economy was based on agriculture, particularly cotton plantations, which were established across the uplands. These plantations and their owners&#x27; profits were dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans before the Civil War. Madison County was one of the largest cotton-producing counties in the state.

Madison County was the largest county in Alabama in population from 1810 to 1840. In the 1810 census alone, Madison County made up nearly half of the population in what would become Alabama, though this did not include Native American tribes and their people. By 1850 however it would lose the title and be the 7th due to its population growth having slowed down. The likely reason was due to Madison County having mainly relied on cotton with little to no other industries.

Cotton remained important after the war. Most labor for cultivation was still provided by African Americans, but they worked as sharecroppers and tenant farmers. By the late 19th century, textile mills had been established around the county; they were restricted to white workers by the Jim Crow practices of racial segregation. During the early 20th century, the economy continued to be largely agricultural, although textile mills expanded their production.

During World War II, the Army established Redstone Arsenal here as a chemical weapon manufacturing site, and the county attracted related industries. After the war, it became a center of new weapon and rocket development. In 1950, a group of exiled German rocket scientists, led by Wernher von Braun, came to Redstone Arsenal from Fort Bliss, Texas in order to conduct research and development of new types of rockets.

By the 1960s, research expanded to rockets for space exploration. The Redstone rocket was modified to launch the first two Americans into space. The US began to emphasize investment in the Space Race, in order to compete with the Soviet Union during the Cold War years and to increase scientific gains. This work in the defense and space industries has generated tens of thousands of jobs in the area, most of them private contractors working in these fields. The population of Madison County has risen from 72,903 in 1950 to an estimated 403,565 in 2022.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.4%) is water.

==Politics==
Madison County was formerly an overwhelmingly Democratic county as with most of the rest of Alabama, with only a narrow loss by Al Smith in 1928 due to Prohibitionist anti-Catholicism disrupting this trend until the 1960s. Even in 1964, the county nearly voted against Barry Goldwater due to its opposition to the Arizona Senator&#x27;s privatization plans for the Tennessee Valley Authority. However, since that time, the county has become solidly Republican, with the only national Democratic nominee to carry the county since 1960 being Deep South native Jimmy Carter in 1976. In the 2016 election, Gary Johnson had his best showing in the state, carrying 4.05 percent of the vote. The county is trending less Republican recently, 58.9% in 2004, 56.9% in 2008, 54.8% in 2016, and in 2020 the Republican margin of victory was the lowest since 1980. For Alabama counties supporting Donald Trump in 2016, it was the fourth narrowest margin, and in 2020 the third-narrowest after Conecuh and Barbour.

The governing body of the county is a commission. The commission is responsible for levying the county tax, establish, maintain, and discontinue county roads and bridges. The commission is also responsible for the county jail as well as the sheriff&#x27;s department. 
The County Commission is composed of seven members. A Chairman is elected at-large by the county while each of the other six members is elected by their districts. Each commissioner serves a four-year term. In 2020, Violet Edwards made history becoming the first black woman to be elected to the Madison County Commission.

<doc id="80785" wikidata="Q214932" url="?curid=80785" title="Flight simulator">
<text>A flight simulator is a device that artificially re-creates aircraft flight and the environment in which it flies, for pilot training, design, or other purposes. It includes replicating the equations that govern how aircraft fly, how they react to applications of flight controls, the effects of other aircraft systems, and how the aircraft reacts to external factors such as air density, turbulence, wind shear, cloud, precipitation, etc. Flight simulation is used for a variety of reasons, including flight training (mainly of pilots), the design and development of the aircraft itself, and research into aircraft characteristics and control handling qualities.

The term &quot;flight simulator&quot; may carry slightly different meaning in general language and technical documents. In past regulations, it referred specifically to devices which can closely mimic the behavior of aircraft throughout various procedures and flight conditions. In more recent definitions, this has been named &quot;full flight simulator&quot;. The more generic term &quot;flight simulation training device&quot; (FSTD) is used to refer to different kinds of flight training devices, and that corresponds more closely to meaning of the phrase &quot;flight simulator&quot; in general English.

==History of flight simulation==
In 1910, on the initiative of the French commanders Clolus and Laffont and Lieutenant Clavenad, the first ground training aircraft for military aircraft were built. The &quot;Tonneau Antoinette&quot; (Antoinette barrel), created by the Antoinette company, seems to be the precursor of flight simulators.

===World War I (1914–1918)===
An area of training was for air gunnery handled by the pilot or a specialist air gunner. Firing at a moving target requires aiming ahead of the target (which involves the so-called lead angle) to allow for the time the bullets require to reach the vicinity of the target. This is sometimes also called &quot;deflection shooting&quot; and requires skill and practice. During World War I, some ground-based simulators were developed to teach this skill to new pilots.

===The 1920s and 1930s===
The best-known early flight simulation device was the Link Trainer, produced by Edwin Link in Binghamton, New York, United States, which he started building in 1927. He later patented his design, which was first available for sale in 1929. The Link Trainer was a basic metal frame flight simulator usually painted in its well-known blue color. Some of these early war era flight simulators still exist, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find working examples.

The Link family firm in Binghamton manufactured player pianos and organs, and Ed Link was therefore familiar with such components as leather bellows and reed switches. He was also a pilot, but dissatisfied with the amount of real flight training that was available, he decided to build a ground-based device to provide such training without the restrictions of weather and the availability of aircraft and flight instructors. His design had a pneumatic motion platform driven by inflatable bellows which provided pitch and roll cues. A vacuum motor similar to those used in player pianos rotated the platform, providing yaw cues. A generic replica cockpit with working instruments was mounted on the motion platform. When the cockpit was covered, pilots could practice flying by instruments in a safe environment. The motion platform gave the pilot cues as to real angular motion in pitch (nose up and down), roll (wing up or down) and yaw (nose left and right).

Initially, aviation flight schools showed little interest in the &quot;Link Trainer&quot;. Link also demonstrated his trainer to the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF), but with no result. However, the situation changed in 1934 when the Army Air Force was given a government contract to fly the postal mail. This included having to fly in bad weather as well as good, for which the USAAF had not previously carried out much training. During the first weeks of the mail service, nearly a dozen Army pilots were killed. The Army Air Force hierarchy remembered Ed Link and his trainer. Link flew in to meet them at Newark Field in New Jersey, and they were impressed by his ability to arrive on a day with poor visibility, due to practice on his training device. The result was that the USAAF purchased six Link Trainers, and this can be said to mark the start of the world flight simulation industry.

===World War II (1939–1945)===
The principal pilot trainer used during World War II was the Link Trainer. Some 10,000 were produced to train 500,000 new pilots from allied nations, many in the US and Canada because many pilots were trained in those countries before returning to Europe or the Pacific to fly combat missions. Almost all US Army Air Force pilots were trained in a Link Trainer.

A different type of World War II trainer was used for navigating at night by the stars. The Celestial Navigation Trainer of 1941 was 13.7 m (45 ft) high and capable of accommodating the navigation team of a bomber crew. It enabled sextants to be used for taking &quot;star shots&quot; from a projected display of the night sky.

===1945 to the 1960s===
In 1954 United Airlines bought four flight simulators at a cost of $3 million from Curtiss-Wright that were similar to the earlier models, with the addition of visuals, sound and movement. This was the first of today&#x27;s modern flight simulators for commercial aircraft.

A simulator for helicopters existed as the Jacobs Jaycopter as means of “Cutting helicopter training cost.”. The simulator was later sold as a funfair ride in the 1964-65 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

===Today===
The simulator manufacturers are consolidating and integrate vertically as training offers double-digit growth: CAE forecast 255,000 new airline pilots from 2017 to 2027 (70 a day), and 180,000 first officers evolving to captains.
The largest manufacturer is Canadian CAE Inc. with a 70% market share and $2.8 billion annual revenues, manufacturing training devices for 70 years but moved into training in 2000 with multiple acquisitions. Now CAE makes more from training than from producing the simulators.
Crawley-based L3 CTS entered the market in 2012 by acquiring Thales Training &amp; Simulation&#x27;s manufacturing plant near Gatwick Airport where it assembles up to 30 devices a year, then UK CTC training school in 2015, Aerosim in Sanford, Florida in 2016, and Portuguese academy G Air in October 2017.

With a 20% market share, equipment still accounts for more than half of L3 CTS turnover but that could soon be reversed as it educates 1,600 commercial pilots each year, 7% of the 22,000 entering the profession annually, and aims for 10% in a fragmented market.
The third largest is TRU Simulation + Training, created in 2014 when parent Textron Aviation merged its simulators with Mechtronix, OPINICUS and ProFlight, focusing on simulators and developing the first full-flight simulators for the 737 MAX and the 777X.
The fourth is FlightSafety International, focused on general, business and regional aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing have invested in their own training centres, aiming for higher margins than aircraft manufacturing like MRO, competing with their suppliers CAE and L3.

In June 2018, there were 1,270 commercial airline simulators in service, up by 50 over a year: 85% FFSs and 15% s.
CAE supplied 56% of this installed base, L3 CTS 20% and FlightSafety International 10%, while CAE&#x27;s training centres are the largest operator, with a 13% share.
North America has 38% of the world&#x27;s training devices, Asia-Pacific 25% and Europe 24%.
Boeing types represent 45% of all simulated aircraft, followed by Airbus with 35%, then Embraer at 7%, Bombardier at 6% and ATR at 3%.
== Applications ==

=== Pilot training ===
Most flight simulators are used primarily for flight training. The simplest simulators are used to practice basic cockpit procedures, such as processing emergency checklists, and for cockpit familiarization. They are also used for instrument flight training, for which the outside view is less important. Certain aircraft systems may or may not be simulated, and the aerodynamic model is usually extremely generic if present at all. Depending on the level of certification, instruments that would have moving indicators in a real aircraft may be implemented with a display. With more advanced displays, cockpit representation and motion systems, flight simulators can be used to credit different amount of flight hours towards a pilot license.

Specific classes of simulators are also used for training other than obtaining initial license such as instrument rating revalidation, or most commonly obtaining type rating for specific kind of aircraft.

=== Other uses ===

During the aircraft design process, flight simulators can be used instead of performing actual flight tests. Such &quot;engineering flight simulators&quot; can provide a fast way to find errors, reducing both the risks and the cost of development significantly. Additionally, this allows use of extra measurement equipment that might be too large or otherwise impractical to include during onboard a real aircraft. Throughout different phases of the design process, different engineering simulators with various level of complexity are used.

Flight simulators may include training tasks for crew other than pilots. Examples include gunners on a military aircraft or hoist operators. Separate simulators have also been used for tasks related to flight, like evacuating the aircraft in case of a crash in water. With high complexity of many systems composing contemporary aircraft, aircraft maintenance simulators are increasingly popular.

==Qualification and approval==

===Procedure===
Before September 2018, when a manufacturer wished to have an ATD model approved, a document that contains the specifications for the model line and that proves compliance with the appropriate regulations is submitted to the FAA. Once this document, called a Qualification Approval Guide (QAG), has been approved, all future devices conforming to the QAG are automatically approved and individual evaluation is neither required nor available.

The actual procedure accepted by all CAAs (Civil Aviation Authorities) around the world is to propose 30 days prior qualification date (40 days for CAAC) a MQTG document (Master Qualification Test Guide), which is proper to a unique simulator device and will live along the device itself, containing objective, and functional and subjective tests to demonstrate the representativeness of the simulator compare to the airplane. The results will be compared to Flight Test Data provided by aircraft OEMs or from test campaign ordered by simulator OEMs or also can be compared by POM (Proof Of Match) data provided by aircraft OEMs development simulators. Some of the QTGs will be rerun during the year to prove during continuous qualification that the simulator is still in the tolerances approved by the CAA.

=== Simulator structure ===
Flight simulators are an example of a human-in-the-loop system, in which interaction with a human user is constantly happening. From perspective of the device, the inputs are primary flight controls, instrument panel buttons and switches and the instructor&#x27;s station, if present. Based on these, the internal state is updated, and equations of motion solved for the new time step. The new state of the simulated aircraft is shown to the user through visual, auditory, motion and touch channels.

To simulate cooperative tasks, the simulator can be suited for multiple users, as is the case with multi-crew cooperation simulators. Alternatively, more simulators can be connected, what is known as &quot;parallel simulation&quot; or &quot;distributed simulation&quot;. As military aircraft often need to cooperate with other craft or military personnel, wargames are a common use for distributed simulation. Because of that, numerous standards for distributed simulation including aircraft have been developed with military organisations. Some examples include SIMNET, DIS and HLA .

=== Simulation models ===

The central element of a simulation model are the equations of motion for the aircraft. As the aircraft moves through atmosphere it can exhibit both translational and rotational degrees of freedom. To achieve perception of fluent movement, these equations are solved 50 or 60 times per second. The forces for motion are calculated from aerodynamical models, which in turn depend on state of control surfaces, driven by specific systems, with their avionics, etc. As is the case with modelling, depending on the required level of realism, there are different levels of detail, with some sub-models omitted in simpler simulators.

If a human user is part of the simulator, which might not be the case for some engineering simulators, there is a need to perform the simulation in real-time. Low refresh rates not only reduce realism of simulation, but they have also been linked with increase in simulator sickness. The regulations place a limit on maximum latency between pilot input and aircraft reaction. Because of that, tradeoffs are made to reach the required level of realism with a lower computational cost. Flight simulators typically don&#x27;t include full computational fluid dynamics models for forces or weather, but use databases of prepared results from calculations and data acquired in real flights. As an example, instead of simulating flow over the wings, lift coefficient may be defined in terms of motion parameters like angle of attack.

While different models need to exchange data, most often they can be separated into a modular architecture, for better organisation and ease of development. Typically, gear model for ground handling would be separate input to the main equations of motion. Each engine and avionics instrument is also a self-contained system with well-defined inputs and outputs.

=== Instruments ===
All classes of require some form of replicating the cockpit. As they are the primary means of interaction between the pilot and the aircraft special importance is assigned to cockpit controls. To achieve good transfer of skills, there are very specific requirements in the flight simulator regulations that determine how closely they must match the real aircraft. These requirements in case of full flight simulators are so detailed, that it may be cost-effective to use the real part certified to fly, rather than manufacture a dedicated replica. Lower classes of simulators may use springs to mimic forces felt when moving the controls. When there is a need to better replicate the control forces or dynamic response, many simulators are equipped with actively driven force feedback systems. Vibration actuators may also be included, either due to helicopter simulation requirements, or for aircraft equipped with a stick shaker.

Another form of tactile input from the pilot are instruments located on the panels in the cockpit. As they are used to interact with various aircraft systems, just that may be sufficient for some forms of procedure training. Displaying them on a screen is sufficient for the most basic simulators and amateur flight simulation, however most classes of certified simulators need all buttons, switches and other inputs to be operated in the same way as in the aircraft cockpit. The necessity for a physical copy of a cockpit contributes to the cost of simulator construction, and ties the hardware to a specific aircraft type. Because of these reasons, there is ongoing research on interactions in virtual reality, however lack of tactile feedback negatively affects users&#x27; performance when using this technology.

=== Visual system ===
Outside view from the aircraft is an important cue for flying the aircraft, and is the primary means of navigation for visual flight rules operation. One of the primary characteristics of a visual system is the field of view. Depending on the simulator type it may be sufficient to provide only a view forward using a flat display. However, some types of craft, e.g. fighter aircraft, require a very large field of view, preferably almost full sphere, due to the manoeuvres that are performed during air combat. Similarly, since helicopters can perform hover flight in any direction, some classes of helicopter flight simulators require even 180 degrees of horizontal field of view.

There are many parameters in visual system design. For a narrow field of view, a single display may be sufficient, however typically multiple projectors are required. This arrangement needs additional calibration, both in terms of distortion from not projecting on a flat surface, as well as brightness in regions with overlapping projections. There are also different shapes of screens used, including cylindrical, spherical or ellipsoidal. The image can be projected on the viewing side of the projection screen, or alternatively &quot;back-projection&quot; onto a translucent screen. Because the screen is much closer than objects outside aircraft, the most advanced flight simulators employ cross-cockpit collimated displays that eliminate the parallax effect between the pilots&#x27; point of view, and provide a more realistic view of distant objects.

An alternative to large-scale displays are virtual reality simulators using a head-mounted display. This approach allows for a complete field of view, and makes the simulator size considerably smaller. There are examples of use in research, as well as certified .

==== Contribution to modern computer graphics ====
Visual simulation science applied from the visual systems developed in flight simulators were also an important precursor to three dimensional computer graphics and Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) systems today. Namely because the object of flight simulation is to reproduce on the ground the behavior of an aircraft in flight. Much of this reproduction had to do with believable visual synthesis that mimicked reality. Combined with the need to pair virtual synthesis with military level training requirements, graphics technologies applied in flight simulation were often years ahead of what would have been available in commercial products. When CGI was first used to train pilots, early systems proved effective for certain simple training missions but needed further development for sophisticated training tasks as terrain following and other tactical maneuvers. Early CGI systems could depict only objects consisting of planar polygons. Advances in algorithms and electronics in flight simulator visual systems and CGI in the 1970s and 1980s influenced many technologies still used in modern graphics. Over time CGI systems were able to superimpose texture over the surfaces and transition from one level of image detail to the next one in a smooth manner. Real-time computer graphics visualization of virtual worlds makes some aspects of flight simulator visual systems very similar to game engines, sharing some techniques like different levels of details or libraries like OpenGL. Many computer graphics visionaries began their careers at Evans &amp; Sutherland and Link Flight Simulation, Division of Singer Company, two leading companies in flight simulation before today&#x27;s modern computing era. For example, the Singer Link Digital Image Generator (DIG) created in 1978 was considered one of the worlds first CGI system.

=== Motion system ===
Initially, the motion systems used separate axes of movement, similar to a gimbal. After the invention of Stewart platform simultaneous operation of all actuators became the preferred choice, with some regulations specifically requiring &quot;synergistic&quot; 6 degrees of freedom motion. In contrast to real aircraft, the simulated motion system has a limited range in which it is able to move. That especially affects the ability to simulate sustained accelerations, and requires a separate model to approximate the cues to the human vestibular system within the given constraints.
Motion system is a major contributor to overall simulator cost, but assessments of skill transfer based on training on a simulator and leading to handling an actual aircraft are difficult to make, particularly where motion cues are concerned. Large samples of pilot opinion are required and many subjective opinions tend to be aired, particularly by pilots not used to making objective assessments and responding to a structured test schedule. For many years, it was believed that 6 DOF motion-based simulation gave the pilot closer fidelity to flight control operations and aircraft responses to control inputs and external forces and gave a better training outcome for students than non-motion-based simulation. This is described as &quot;handling fidelity&quot;, which can be assessed by test flight standards such as the numerical Cooper-Harper rating scale for handling qualities. Recent scientific studies have shown that the use of technology such as vibration or dynamic seats within flight simulators can be equally effective in the delivery of training as large and expensive 6-DOF FFS devices.

== Modern high-end flight simulators ==

===Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at NASA/Ames===
The largest flight simulator in the world is the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at NASA Ames Research Center, in Mountain View, California. This has a very large-throw motion system with 60 feet (+/- 30 ft) of vertical movement (heave). The heave system supports a horizontal beam on which are mounted 40 ft rails, allowing lateral movement of a simulator cab of +/- 20 feet. A conventional 6-degree of freedom hexapod platform is mounted on the 40 ft beam, and an interchangeable cabin is mounted on the platform. This design permits quick switching of different aircraft cabins. Simulations have ranged from blimps, commercial and military aircraft to the Space Shuttle. In the case of the Space Shuttle, the large Vertical Motion Simulator was used to investigate a longitudinal pilot-induced oscillation (PIO) that occurred on an early Shuttle flight just before landing. After identification of the problem on the VMS, it was used to try different longitudinal control algorithms and recommend the best for use in the Shuttle program.

===Disorientation training===

AMST Systemtechnik GmbH (AMST) of Austria and Environmental Tectonics Corporation (ETC) of Philadelphia, US, manufacture a range of simulators for disorientation training, that have full freedom in yaw. The most complex of these devices is the Desdemona simulator at the TNO Research Institute in The Netherlands, manufactured by AMST. This large simulator has a gimballed cockpit mounted on a framework which adds vertical motion. The framework is mounted on rails attached to a rotating platform. The rails allow the simulator cab to be positioned at different radii from the centre of rotation and this gives a sustained G capability up to about 3.5.

<text>Cross Platform Component Object Model (XPCOM) is a cross-platform component model from Mozilla. It is similar to Component Object Model (COM), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and system object model (SOM). It features multiple language bindings and interface description language (IDL) descriptions; thus programmers can plug their custom functions into the framework and connect it with other components.

The most prominent usage of XPCOM is within the Firefox web browser. Many of its internal components interact via XPCOM interfaces. Furthermore, Firefox used to allow add-ons extensive XPCOM access, but this was removed in 2017 and replaced with the less-permissive WebExtensions API. (Two forks of Firefox still support XPCOM add-on capability: Pale Moon and Basilisk.)

==Model==
XPCOM is one of the main things making the Mozilla application environment an actual framework. It is a development environment that provides the following features for the cross-platform software developer:

* Component management
* File abstraction
* Object message passing
* Memory management

This component object model makes virtually all of the functionality of Gecko available as a series of components, or reusable cross-platform libraries, that can be accessed from the web browser or scripted from any Mozilla application. Applications that must access the various Mozilla XPCOM libraries (networking, security, DOM, etc.) use a special layer of XPCOM called XPConnect, which reflects the library interfaces into JavaScript, or other languages. XPConnect glues the front end to the C++, C, or Rust programming language based components in XPCOM, and it can be extended to include scripting support for other languages: PyXPCOM already offers support for Python. wxWidgets provide support for Perl, and there are efforts underway to add Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) and Ruby language support for XPConnect.

For developers, XPCOM allows writing components in C++, C, JavaScript, Python, or other languages for which special bindings have been created, and compile and run those components on dozens of different platforms, including these and others where Mozilla is supported.

The flexibility to reuse the XPCOM components from the Gecko library and develop new components that run on different platforms facilitates rapid application development and results in an application that is more productive and easier to maintain. The networking library, for example, is a set of XPCOM components that can be accessed and used by any Mozilla application. File I/O, security, password management, and profiles are also separate XPCOM components that programmers can use in their own application development.

==Past overuse==
XPCOM adds a lot of code for marshalling objects, and in the Netscape era XPCOM was overused for internal interfaces where it wasn&#x27;t truly necessary, resulting in software bloat. This was a key reason why in 2001 Apple forked KHTML, not Gecko, to create the WebKit engine for its Safari browser.

Mozilla has since cleaned up some of the XPCOM bloat. By 2008, this combined with other efforts resulted in big performance improvements for Gecko.

<text>Marengo County is a county located in the west central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 19,323. The largest city is Demopolis, and the county seat is Linden. It is named in honor of the Battle of Marengo near Turin, Italy, where French leader Napoleon Bonaparte defeated the Austrians on June 14, 1800.

==History==
Marengo County was created by the Alabama Territorial legislature on February 6, 1818, from land acquired from the Choctaw by the Treaty of Fort St. Stephens on October 24, 1816. Like the other four of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot;, over the course of the following twenty years the Choctaw were largely forced west of the Mississippi River and into what is now Oklahoma during the period of Indian Removal conducted by the federal government.

The county was named to commemorate Napoleon&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Marengo over Austrian armies on June 14, 1800. This name was chosen in honor of the first European settlers, Bonapartists exiled from France after Napoleon&#x27;s downfall. In 1817 a number of French settled the area around Demopolis. They were trying to develop a Vine and Olive Colony. Other ethnic French who settled here were refugees from the colony of Saint-Domingue, where enslaved Africans and &quot;free people of color&quot; had routed Napoleon&#x27;s troops and white colonists, and declared independence in 1804. They established the territory as Haiti, the second republic in the western hemisphere.

The county seat was originally known as the Town of Marengo, but in 1823 the name was changed to Linden. Linden is a shortened version of Hohenlinden, scene of the Battle of Hohenlinden, a French victory in Bavaria on December 3, 1800, during Napoleon&#x27;s campaign.

Situated in Alabama&#x27;s Black Belt and having a naturally rich soil, the county was developed by planters for numerous cotton plantations, dependent on the forced labor of large gangs of enslaved African Americans. The enslaved comprised the majority of the county population decades before the American Civil War. In 1860 the population consisted of 24,409 slaves, 6,761 free whites (including 944 slave owners), and one &quot;free person of color,&quot; for a total combined population of 31,171. At this time there were 778 plantations and farms in the county.

The fourth-oldest Jewish congregation in Alabama, B&#x27;nai Jeshurun, was established in Demopolis in 1858 by immigrants and migrants from other Southern cities.

After the Civil War, the economy continued to be based on agriculture. In the transition to free labor, many freedmen turned to sharecropping or tenant farming as a way to establish some independence. They did not want to work in white-controlled field gangs.

The county population began to diminish rapidly during and after World War II. People left the farms for manufacturing jobs elsewhere, particularly with the wartime buildup of the defense industry on the West Coast. The movement of African Americans out of Alabama and other parts of the South was considered part of the Great Migration, by which 5 million left the region from 1940 to 1970. In addition to seeking jobs, they sought better conditions than the disfranchisement and Jim Crow oppression they faced in Alabama and other states of the South.

Most of the former cotton fields were gradually converted to pastures for cattle and horses, developed into tree plantations for timber and paper production, or transformed into commercial ponds for farming grain-fed catfish. Beginning in the 1960s, industry began to move into the area. The work force was employed in paper mills, lumber mills, and chemical plants.

County courthouse fires occurred in 1848 and 1965. Each time most of the court records were saved, as they were in a protected vault.

==Geography==

Marengo County is situated in the west-central area of the state. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water. The entire western county border is formed by the Tombigbee River and a small northwestern portion is formed by the Black Warrior River.
