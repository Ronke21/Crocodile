<text>Cybele ( ; Phrygian: &quot;Matar Kubileya, Kubeleya&quot; &quot;Kubeleya Mother&quot;, perhaps &quot;Mountain Mother&quot;; Lydian: &quot;Kuvava&quot;; &quot;Kybélē&quot;, &quot;Kybēbē&quot;, &quot;Kybelis&quot;) is an Anatolian mother goddess; she may have a possible forerunner in the earliest neolithic at Çatalhöyük. She is Phrygia&#x27;s only known goddess, and likely, its national deity. Greek colonists in Asia Minor adopted and adapted her Phrygian cult and spread it to mainland Greece and to the more distant western Greek colonies around the sixth century BC.

In Greece, Cybele met with a mixed reception. She became partially assimilated to aspects of the Earth-goddess Gaia, of her possibly Minoan equivalent Rhea, and of the harvest–mother goddess Demeter. Some city-states, notably Athens, evoked her as a protector, but her most celebrated Greek rites and processions show her as an essentially foreign, exotic mystery-goddess who arrives in a lion-drawn chariot to the accompaniment of wild music, wine, and a disorderly, ecstatic following. Uniquely in Greek religion, she had a eunuch mendicant priesthood. Many of her Greek cults included rites to a divine Phrygian castrate shepherd-consort Attis, who was probably a Greek invention. In Greece, Cybele became associated with mountains, town and city walls, fertile nature, and wild animals, especially lions.

In Rome, Cybele became known as Magna Mater (&quot;Great Mother&quot;). The Roman state adopted and developed a particular form of her cult after the Sibylline oracle in 205 BC recommended her conscription as a key religious ally in Rome&#x27;s second war against Carthage (218 to 201 BC). Roman mythographers reinvented her as a Trojan goddess, and thus an ancestral goddess of the Roman people by way of the Trojan prince Aeneas. As Rome eventually established hegemony over the Mediterranean world, Romanized forms of Cybele&#x27;s cults spread throughout Rome&#x27;s empire. Greek and Roman writers debated and disputed the meaning and morality of her cults and priesthoods, which remain controversial subjects in modern scholarship.

== Anatolia==

No contemporary text or myth survives to attest the original character and nature of Cybele&#x27;s Phrygian cult. She may have evolved from a statuary type found at Çatalhöyük in Anatolia, of a &quot;corpulent and fertile&quot; female figure accompanied by large felines, dated to the 6th millennium BC and identified by some as a mother goddess. In Phrygian art of the 8th century BC, the cult attributes of the Phrygian mother-goddess include attendant lions, a bird of prey, and a small vase for her libations or other offerings.

The inscription &quot;Matar Kubileya/Kubeleya&quot; at a Phrygian rock-cut shrine, dated to the first half of the 6th century BC, is usually read as &quot;Mother of the mountain&quot;, a reading supported by ancient classical sources, and consistent with Cybele as any of several similar tutelary goddesses, each known as &quot;mother&quot; and associated with specific Anatolian mountains or other localities: a goddess thus &quot;born from stone&quot;. She is ancient Phrygia&#x27;s only known goddess, the divine companion or consort of its mortal rulers, and was probably the highest deity of the Phrygian state. Her name, and the development of religious practices associated with her, may have been influenced by the Kubaba cult of the deified Sumerian queen Kubaba.

In the 2nd century AD, the geographer Pausanias attests to a Magnesian (Lydian) cult to &quot;the mother of the gods&quot;, whose image was carved into a rock-spur of Mount Sipylus. This was believed to be the oldest image of the goddess, and was attributed to the legendary Broteas. At Pessinos in Phrygia, the mother goddess—identified by the Greeks as Cybele—took the form of an unshaped stone of black meteoric iron, and may have been associated with or identical to Agdistis, Pessinos&#x27; mountain deity. This was the aniconic stone that was removed to Rome in 204 BC.

Images and iconography in funerary contexts, and the ubiquity of her Phrygian name &quot;Matar&quot; (&quot;Mother&quot;), suggest that she was a mediator between the &quot;boundaries of the known and unknown&quot;: the civilized and the wild, the worlds of the living and the dead. Her association with hawks, lions, and the stone of the mountainous landscape of the Anatolian wilderness, seem to characterize her as mother of the land in its untrammeled natural state, with power to rule, moderate or soften its latent ferocity, and to control its potential threats to a settled, civilized life. Anatolian elites sought to harness her protective power to forms of ruler-cult; in Phrygia, the Midas monument connects her with king Midas, as her sponsor, consort, or co-divinity. As protector of cities, or city states, she was sometimes shown wearing a mural crown, representing the city walls. At the same time, her power &quot;transcended any purely political usage and spoke directly to the goddess&#x27; followers from all walks of life&quot;.

Some Phrygian shaft monuments are thought to have been used for libations and blood offerings to Cybele, perhaps anticipating by several centuries the pit used in her taurobolium and criobolium sacrifices during the Roman imperial era. Over time, her Phrygian cults and iconography were transformed, and eventually subsumed, by the influences and interpretations of her foreign devotees, at first Greek and later Roman.

==Greek Cybele==
From around the 6th century BC, cults to the Anatolian mother-goddess were introduced from Phrygia into the ethnically Greek colonies of western Anatolia, mainland Greece, the Aegean islands and the westerly colonies of Magna Graecia. The Greeks called her &quot;Mātēr&quot; or &quot;Mētēr&quot; (&quot;Mother&quot;), or from the early 5th century &quot;Kubélē&quot;; in Pindar, she is &quot;Mistress Cybele the Mother&quot;. In Homeric Hymn 14 she is &quot;the Mother of all gods and all human beings.&quot; Cybele was readily assimilated with several Greek goddesses, especially Rhea, as &quot;Mētēr theōn&quot; (&quot;Mother of the gods&quot;), whose raucous, ecstatic rites she may have acquired. As an exemplar of devoted motherhood, she was partly assimilated to the grain-goddess Demeter, whose torchlight procession recalled her search for her lost daughter, Persephone; but she also continued to be identified as a foreign deity, with many of her traits reflecting Greek ideas about barbarians and the wilderness, as &quot;Mētēr oreia&quot; (&quot;Mother of the Mountains&quot;). She is depicted as a Potnia Theron (&quot;Mistress of animals&quot;), with her mastery of the natural world expressed by the lions that flank her, sit in her lap, or draw her chariot. This schema may derive from a goddess figure from Minoan religion. Walter Burkert places her among the &quot;foreign gods&quot; of Greek religion, a complex figure combining a putative Minoan-Mycenaean tradition with the Phrygian cult imported directly from Asia Minor.
Cybele&#x27;s early Greek images are small votive representations of her monumental rock-cut images in the Phrygian highlands. She stands alone within a naiskos, which represents her temple or its doorway, and is crowned with a &quot;polos&quot;, a high, cylindrical hat. A long, flowing chiton covers her shoulders and back. She is sometimes shown with lions in attendance. Around the 5th century BC, Agoracritos created a fully Hellenised and influential image of Cybele that was set up in the Metroon in the Athenian agora. It showed her enthroned, with a lion attendant, holding a &quot;phiale&quot; (a dish for making libations to the gods) and a &quot;tympanon&quot; (a hand drum). Both were Greek innovations to her iconography and reflect key features of her ritual worship introduced by the Greeks which would be salient in the cult&#x27;s later development.

For the Greeks, the tympanon was a marker of foreign cults, suitable for rites to Cybele, her close equivalent Rhea, and Dionysus; of these, only Cybele holds the tympanon. She appears with Dionysus, as a secondary deity in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Bacchae&quot;, 64 – 186, and Pindar&#x27;s &quot;Dithyramb&quot; II.6 – 9. In the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; formerly attributed to Apollodorus, Cybele is said to have cured Dionysus of his madness. 
Their cults shared several characteristics: the foreigner-deity arrived in a chariot, drawn by exotic big cats (Dionysus by tigers or panthers, Cybele by lions), accompanied by wild music and an ecstatic entourage of exotic foreigners and people from the lower classes. At the end of the 1st century BC Strabo notes that Rhea-Cybele&#x27;s popular rites in Athens were sometimes held in conjunction with Dionysus&#x27; procession. Both were regarded with caution by the Greeks, as being foreign, to be simultaneously embraced and &quot;held at arm&#x27;s length&quot;.

Cybele was also the focus of mystery cult, private rites with a chthonic aspect connected to hero cult and exclusive to those who had undergone initiation, although it is unclear who Cybele&#x27;s initiates were. Reliefs show her alongside young female and male attendants with torches, and with vessels for purification. Literary sources describe joyous abandonment to the loud, percussive music of tympanon, castanets, clashing cymbals, and flutes, and to the frenzied &quot;Phrygian dancing&quot;, perhaps a form of circle-dancing by women, to the roar of &quot;wise and healing music of the gods&quot;.

In literary sources, the spread of Cybele&#x27;s cult is presented as a source of conflict and crisis. Herodotus says that when Anacharsis returned to Scythia after traveling and acquiring knowledge among the Greeks in the 6th century BC, his brother, the Scythian king, put him to death for celebrating Cybele&#x27;s mysteries. The historicity of this account and that of Anacharsis himself are widely questioned. In Athenian tradition, the city&#x27;s Metroon was founded to placate Cybele, who had visited a plague on Athens when one of her wandering priests was killed for his attempt to introduce her cult. The earliest source is the &quot;Hymn to the Mother of the Gods&quot; (362 AD) by the Roman emperor Julian, but references to it appear in scholia from an earlier date. The account may reflect real resistance to Cybele&#x27;s cult, but Lynne Roller sees it as a story intended to demonstrate Cybele&#x27;s power, similar to myth of Dionysus&#x27; arrival in Thebes recounted in &quot;The Bacchae&quot;. Many of Cybele&#x27;s cults were funded privately, rather than by the polis, but she also had publicly established temples in many Greek cities, including Athens and Olympia. Her &quot;vivid and forceful character&quot; and association with the wild, set her apart from the Olympian deities. Her association with Phrygia led to particular unease in Greece after the Persian Wars, as Phrygian symbols and costumes were increasingly associated with the Achaemenid empire. 
Conflation with Rhea led to Cybele&#x27;s association with various male demigods who served Rhea as attendants, or as guardians of her son, the infant Zeus, as he lay in the cave of his birth. In cult terms, they seem to have functioned as intercessors or intermediaries between goddess and mortal devotees, through dreams, waking trance, or ecstatic dance and song. They include the armed Curetes, who danced around Zeus and clashed their shields to amuse him; their supposedly Phrygian equivalents, the youthful Corybantes, who provided similarly wild and martial music, dance and song; and the dactyls and Telchines, magicians associated with metalworking.

=== Cybele and Attis ===
Cybele&#x27;s major mythographic narratives attach to her relationship with Attis, who is described by ancient Greek and Roman sources and cults as her youthful consort, and as a Phrygian deity. In Phrygia, &quot;Attis&quot; was not a deity, but both a commonplace and priestly name, found alike in casual graffiti, the dedications of personal monuments, as well as at several of Cybele&#x27;s Phrygian shrines and monuments. His divinity may therefore have begun as a Greek invention based on what was known of Cybele&#x27;s Phrygian cult. His earliest certain image as deity appears on a 4th-century BC Greek stele from Piraeus, near Athens. It shows him as the Hellenised stereotype of a rustic, eastern barbarian; he sits at ease, sporting the Phrygian cap and shepherd&#x27;s crook of his later Greek and Roman cults. Before him stands a Phrygian goddess (identified by the inscription as Agdistis) who carries a tympanon in her left hand. With her right, she hands him a jug, as if to welcome him into her cult with a share of her own libation. Later images of Attis show him as a shepherd, in similar relaxed attitudes, holding or playing the syrinx (panpipes). In Demosthenes&#x27; &quot;On the Crown&quot; (330 BC), &quot;attes&quot; is &quot;a ritual cry shouted by followers of mystic rites&quot;.

Attis seems to have accompanied the diffusion of Cybele&#x27;s cult through Magna Graecia; there is evidence of their joint cult at the Greek colonies of Marseille (Gaul) and Lokroi (southern Italy) from the 6th and 7th centuries BC. After Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquests, &quot;wandering devotees of the goddess became an increasingly common presence in Greek literature and social life; depictions of Attis have been found at numerous Greek sites&quot;. When shown with Cybele, he is always the younger, lesser deity, or perhaps her priestly attendant. In the mid 2nd century, letters from the king of Pergamum to Cybele&#x27;s shrine at Pessinos consistently address its chief priest as &quot;Attis&quot;. 

== Roman Cybele ==

=== Republican era ===

Romans knew Cybele as &quot;Magna Mater&quot; (&quot;Great Mother&quot;), or as &quot;Magna Mater deorum Idaea&quot; (&quot;great Idaean mother of the gods&quot;), equivalent to the Greek title &quot;Meter Theon Idaia&quot; (&quot;Mother of the Gods, from Mount Ida&quot;). Rome officially adopted her cult during the Second Punic War (218 to 201 BC), after dire prodigies, including a meteor shower, a failed harvest, and famine, seemed to warn of Rome&#x27;s imminent defeat. The Roman Senate and its religious advisers consulted the Sibylline oracle and decided that Carthage might be defeated if Rome imported the &quot;Magna Mater&quot; (&quot;Great Mother&quot;) of Phrygian Pessinos. As this cult object belonged to a Roman ally, the Kingdom of Pergamum, the Roman Senate sent ambassadors to seek the king&#x27;s consent; en route, a consultation with the Greek oracle at Delphi confirmed that the goddess should be brought to Rome. The goddess arrived in Rome in the form of Pessinos&#x27; black meteoric stone. Roman legend connects this voyage, or its end, to the matron Claudia Quinta, who was accused of unchastity but proved her innocence with a miraculous feat on behalf of the goddess. Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, supposedly the &quot;best man&quot; in Rome, was chosen to meet the goddess at Ostia; and Rome&#x27;s most virtuous matrons (including Claudia Quinta) conducted her to the temple of Victoria, to await the completion of her temple on the Palatine Hill. Pessinos&#x27; stone was later used as the face of the statue of the goddess. In due course, the famine ended and Hannibal was defeated.
Most modern scholarship agrees that Cybele&#x27;s consort, Attis, and her eunuch Phrygian priests (Galli) would have arrived with the goddess, along with at least some of the wild, ecstatic features of her Greek and Phrygian cults. The histories of her arrival deal with the piety, purity, and status of the Romans involved, the success of their religious stratagem, and power of the goddess herself; she has no consort or priesthood, and seems fully Romanised from the first. Some modern scholars assume that Attis must have followed much later; or that the Galli, described in later sources as shockingly effeminate and flamboyantly &quot;un-Roman&quot;, must have been an unexpected consequence of bringing the goddess in blind obedience to the Sibyl; a case of &quot;biting off more than one can chew&quot;. Others note that Rome was well versed in the adoption (or sometimes, the &quot;calling forth&quot;, or seizure) of foreign deities, and the diplomats who negotiated Cybele&#x27;s move to Rome would have been well-educated, and well-informed. 

Romans believed that Cybele, considered a Phrygian outsider even within her Greek cults, was the mother-goddess of ancient Troy (Ilium). Some of Rome&#x27;s leading patrician families claimed Trojan ancestry; so the &quot;return&quot; of the Mother of all Gods to her once-exiled people would have been particularly welcome, even if her spouse and priesthood were not; its accomplishment would have reflected well on the principals involved and, in turn, on their descendants. The upper classes who sponsored the Magna Mater&#x27;s festivals delegated their organisation to the plebeian aediles, and honoured her and each other with lavish, private festival banquets from which her Galli would have been conspicuously absent. Whereas in most of her Greek cults she dwelt outside the &quot;polis&quot;, in Rome she was the city&#x27;s protector, contained within her Palatine precinct, along with her priesthood, at the geographical heart of Rome&#x27;s most ancient religious traditions. She was promoted as patrician property; a Roman matron – albeit a strange one, &quot;with a stone for a face&quot; – who acted for the clear benefit of the Roman state.

=== Imperial era ===
Augustan ideology identified Magna Mater with Imperial order and Rome&#x27;s religious authority throughout the empire. Augustus claimed a Trojan ancestry through his adoption by Julius Caesar and the divine favour of Venus; in the iconography of Imperial cult, the empress Livia was Magna Mater&#x27;s earthly equivalent, Rome&#x27;s protector and symbolic &quot;Great Mother&quot;; the goddess is portrayed with Livia&#x27;s face on cameos and statuary. By this time, Rome had absorbed the goddess&#x27;s Greek and Phrygian homelands, and the Roman version of Cybele as Imperial Rome&#x27;s protector was introduced there.

Imperial Magna Mater protected the empire&#x27;s cities and agriculture — Ovid &quot;stresses the barrenness of the earth before the Mother&#x27;s arrival. Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (written between 29 and 19 BC) embellishes her &quot;Trojan&quot; features; she is &quot;Berecyntian Cybele&quot;, mother of Jupiter himself, and protector of the Trojan prince Aeneas in his flight from the destruction of Troy. She gives the Trojans her sacred tree for shipbuilding, and begs Jupiter to make the ships indestructible. These ships become the means of escape for Aeneas and his men, guided toward Italy and a destiny as ancestors of the Roman people by Venus Genetrix. Once arrived in Italy, these ships have served their purpose and are transformed into sea nymphs.

Stories of Magna Mater&#x27;s arrival were used to promote the fame of its principals, and thus their descendants. Claudia Quinta&#x27;s role as Rome&#x27;s &quot;castissima femina&quot; (purest or most virtuous woman) became &quot;increasingly glorified and fantastic&quot;; she was shown in the costume of a Vestal Virgin, and Augustan ideology represented her as the ideal of virtuous Roman womanhood. The emperor Claudius claimed her among his ancestors. Claudius promoted Attis to the Roman pantheon and placed his cult under the supervision of the quindecimviri (one of Rome&#x27;s priestly colleges).

=== Festivals and cults ===

====Megalesia in April====
The &quot;Megalesia&quot; festival to Magna Mater commenced on April 4, the anniversary of her arrival in Rome. The festival structure is unclear, but it included ludi scaenici (plays and other entertainments based on religious themes), probably performed on the deeply stepped approach to her temple; some of the plays were commissioned from well-known playwrights. On April 10, her image was taken in public procession to the Circus Maximus, and chariot races were held there in her honour; a statue of Magna Mater was permanently sited on the racetrack&#x27;s dividing barrier, showing the goddess seated on a lion&#x27;s back.

Roman bystanders seem to have perceived Megalesia as either characteristically &quot;Greek&quot;; or Phrygian. At the cusp of Rome&#x27;s transition to Empire, the Greek Dionysius of Halicarnassus describes this procession as wild Phrygian &quot;mummery&quot; and &quot;fabulous clap-trap&quot;, in contrast to the Megalesian sacrifices and games, carried out in what he admires as a dignified &quot;traditional Roman&quot; manner; Dionysius also applauds the wisdom of Roman religious law, which forbids the participation of any Roman citizen in the procession, and in the goddess&#x27;s mysteries; Slaves are forbidden to witness any of this. In the late republican era, Lucretius vividly describes the procession&#x27;s armed &quot;war dancers&quot; in their three-plumed helmets, clashing their shields together, bronze on bronze, &quot;delighted by blood&quot;; yellow-robed, long-haired, perfumed Galli waving their knives, wild music of thrumming tympanons and shrill flutes. Along the route, rose petals are scattered, and clouds of incense arise. The goddess&#x27;s sculpted image wears the Mural Crown and is seated within a sculpted, lion-drawn chariot, carried high on a bier. The Roman display of Cybele&#x27;s Megalesia procession as an exotic, privileged public pageant offers signal contrast to what is known of the private, socially inclusive Phrygian-Greek mysteries on which it was based.

====&#x27;Holy week&#x27; in March====

The Principate brought the development of an extended festival or &quot;holy week&quot; for Cybele and Attis in March (Latin &quot;Martius)&quot;, from the Ides to nearly the end of the month. Citizens and freedmen were allowed limited forms of participation in rites pertaining to Attis, through their membership of two colleges, each dedicated to a specific task; the &quot;Cannophores&quot; (&quot;reed bearers&quot;) and the &quot;Dendrophores&quot; (&quot;tree bearers&quot;).

* March 15 (Ides): &quot;Canna intrat&quot; (&quot;The Reed enters&quot;), marking the birth of Attis and his exposure in the reeds along the Phrygian river Sangarius, where he was discovered—depending on the version—by either shepherds or Cybele herself. The reed was gathered and carried by the &quot;cannophores&quot;.
* March 22: &quot;Arbor intrat&quot; (&quot;The Tree enters&quot;), commemorating the death of Attis under a pine tree. The &quot;dendrophores&quot; (&quot;tree bearers&quot;) cut down a tree, suspended from it an image of Attis, and carried it to the temple with lamentations. The day was formalized as part of the official Roman calendar under Claudius. A three-day period of mourning followed. 
* March 23: on the Tubilustrium, an archaic holiday to Mars, the tree was laid to rest at the temple of the Magna Mater, with the traditional beating of the shields by Mars&#x27; priests the Salii and the lustration of the trumpets perhaps assimilated to the noisy music of the Corybantes.
* March 24: &quot;Sanguem&quot; or &quot;Dies Sanguinis&quot; (&quot;Day of Blood&quot;), a frenzy of mourning when the devotees whipped themselves to sprinkle the altars and effigy of Attis with their own blood; some performed the self-castrations of the Galli. The &quot;sacred night&quot; followed, with Attis placed in his ritual tomb.
* March 25 (vernal equinox on the Roman calendar): &quot;Hilaria&quot; (&quot;Rejoicing&quot;), when Attis was reborn. Some early Christian sources associate this day with the resurrection of Jesus. Damascius attributed a &quot;liberation from Hades&quot; to the Hilaria.
* March 26: &quot;Requietio&quot; (&quot;Day of Rest&quot;).
* March 27: &quot;Lavatio&quot; (&quot;Washing&quot;), noted by Ovid and probably an innovation under Augustus, Literary references indicate that the &quot;lavatio&quot; was &quot;well established&quot; by the Flavian period; when Cybele&#x27;s sacred stone was taken in procession from the Palatine temple to the Porta Capena and down the Appian Way to the stream called Almo, a tributary of the Tiber. There the stone and sacred iron implements were bathed &quot;in the Phrygian manner&quot; by a red-robed priest. The &quot;quindecimviri&quot; attended. The return trip was made by torchlight, with much rejoicing. The ceremony alluded to, but did not reenact, Cybele&#x27;s original reception in the city, and seems not to have involved Attis.
* March 28: &quot;Initium Caiani&quot;, sometimes interpreted as initiations into the mysteries of the Magna Mater and Attis at the Gaianum, near the Phrygianum sanctuary at the Vatican Hill.

Scholars are divided as to whether the entire series was more or less put into place under Claudius, or whether the festival grew over time. The Phrygian character of the cult would have appealed to the Julio-Claudians as an expression of their claim to Trojan ancestry. It may be that Claudius established observances mourning the death of Attis, before he had acquired his full significance as a resurrected god of rebirth, expressed by rejoicing at the later &quot;Canna intrat&quot; and by the Hilaria. The full sequence at any rate is thought to have been official in the time of Antoninus Pius (reigned 138–161), but among extant &quot;fasti&quot; appears only in the Calendar of Philocalus (354 AD).

====Minor cults====
Significant anniversaries, stations, and participants in the 204 arrival of the goddess – including her ship, which would have been thought a sacred object – may have been marked from the beginning by minor, local, or private rites and festivals at Ostia, Rome, and Victoria&#x27;s temple. Cults to Claudia Quinta are likely, particularly in the Imperial era. Rome seems to have introduced evergreen cones (pine or fir) to Cybele&#x27;s iconography, based at least partly on Rome&#x27;s &quot;Trojan ancestor&quot; myth, in which the goddess gave Aeneas her sacred tree for shipbuilding. The evergreen cones probably symbolised Attis&#x27; death and rebirth. Despite the archaeological evidence of early cult to Attis at Cybele&#x27;s Palatine precinct, no surviving Roman literary or epigraphic source mentions him until Catullus, whose poem 63 places him squarely within Magna Mater&#x27;s mythology, as the hapless leader and prototype of her Galli.

====Taurobolium and Criobolium====
Rome&#x27;s strictures against castration and citizen participation in Magna Mater&#x27;s cult limited both the number and kind of her initiates. From the 160s AD, citizens who sought initiation to her mysteries could offer either of two forms of bloody animal sacrifice – and sometimes both – as lawful substitutes for self-castration. The Taurobolium sacrificed a bull, the most potent and costly victim in Roman religion; the Criobolium used a lesser victim, usually a ram.

A late, melodramatic and antagonistic account by the Christian apologist Prudentius has a priest stand in a pit beneath a slatted wooden floor; his assistants or junior priests dispatch a bull, using a sacred spear. The priest emerges from the pit, drenched with the bull&#x27;s blood, to the applause of the gathered spectators. This description of a Taurobolium as blood-bath is, if accurate, an exception to usual Roman sacrificial practice; it may have been no more than a bull sacrifice in which the blood was carefully collected and offered to the deity, along with its organs of generation, the testicles.

The Taurobolium and Criobolium are not tied to any particular date or festival, but probably draw on the same theological principles as the life, death, and rebirth cycle of the March &quot;holy week&quot;. The celebrant personally and symbolically took the place of Attis, and like him was cleansed, renewed or, in emerging from the pit or tomb, &quot;reborn&quot;. These regenerative effects were thought to fade over time, but they could be renewed by further sacrifice. Some dedications transfer the regenerative power of the sacrifice to non-participants, including emperors, the Imperial family and the Roman state; some mark a &quot;dies natalis&quot; (birthday or anniversary) for the participant or recipient. Dedicants and participants could be male or female.

The sheer expense of the Taurobolium ensured that its initiates were from Rome&#x27;s highest class, and even the lesser offering of a Criobolium would have been beyond the means of the poor. Among the Roman masses, there is evidence of private devotion to Attis, but virtually none for initiations to Magna Mater&#x27;s cult.

In the religious revivalism of the later Imperial era, Magna Mater&#x27;s notable initiates included the deeply religious, wealthy, and erudite praetorian prefect Praetextatus; the quindecimvir Volusianus, who was twice consul; and possibly the Emperor Julian. Taurobolium dedications to Magna Mater tend to be more common in the Empire&#x27;s western provinces than elsewhere, attested by inscriptions in (among others) Rome and Ostia in Italy, Lugdunum in Gaul, and Carthage in Africa.

== Priesthoods ==

&quot;Attis&quot; may have been a name or title of Cybele&#x27;s priests or priest-kings in ancient Phrygia. Most myths of the deified Attis present him as founder of Cybele&#x27;s Galli priesthood but in Servius&#x27; account, written during the Roman Imperial era, Attis castrates a king to escape his unwanted sexual attentions, and is castrated in turn by the dying king. Cybele&#x27;s priests find Attis at the base of a pine tree; he dies and they bury him, emasculate themselves in his memory, and celebrate him in their rites to the goddess. This account might attempt to explain the nature, origin, and structure of Pessinus&#x27; theocracy. A Hellenistic poet refers to Cybele&#x27;s priests in the feminine, as &quot;Gallai&quot;. The Roman poet Catullus refers to Attis in the masculine until his emasculation, and in the feminine thereafter. Various Roman sources refer to the Galli as a middle or third gender (&quot;medium genus&quot; or &quot;tertium sexus&quot;). The Galli&#x27;s voluntary emasculation in service of the goddess was thought to give them powers of prophecy.
Pessinus, site of the temple whence the Magna Mater was brought to Rome, was a theocracy whose leading Galli may have been appointed via some form of adoption, to ensure &quot;dynastic&quot; succession. The highest ranking Gallus was known as &quot;Attis&quot;, and his junior as &quot;Battakes&quot;. The Galli of Pessinus were politically influential; in 189 BC, they predicted or prayed for Roman victory in Rome&#x27;s imminent war against the Galatians. The following year, perhaps in response to this gesture of goodwill, the Roman senate formally recognised Illium as the ancestral home of the Roman people, granting it extra territory and tax immunity. In 103, a Battakes traveled to Rome and addressed its senate, either for the redress of impieties committed at his shrine, or to predict yet another Roman military success. He would have cut a remarkable figure, with &quot;colourful attire and headdress, like a crown, with regal associations unwelcome to the Romans&quot;. Yet the senate supported him; and when a plebeian tribune who had violently opposed his right to address the senate died of a fever (or, in the alternative scenario, when the prophesied Roman victory came) Magna Mater&#x27;s power seemed proven.
In Rome, the Galli and their cult fell under the supreme authority of the pontifices, who were usually drawn from Rome&#x27;s highest ranking, wealthiest citizens. The Galli themselves, although imported to serve the day-to-day workings of their goddess&#x27;s cult on Rome&#x27;s behalf, represented an inversion of Roman priestly traditions in which senior priests were citizens, expected to raise families, and personally responsible for the running costs of their temples, assistants, cults, and festivals. As eunuchs, incapable of reproduction, the Galli were forbidden Roman citizenship and rights of inheritance; like their eastern counterparts, they were technically mendicants whose living depended on the pious generosity of others. For a few days of the year, during the Megalesia, Cybele&#x27;s laws allowed them to leave their quarters, located within the goddess&#x27; temple complex, and roam the streets to beg for money. They were outsiders, marked out as Galli by their regalia, and their notoriously effeminate dress and demeanour, but as priests of a state cult, they were sacred and inviolate. From the start, they were objects of Roman fascination, scorn, and religious awe. No Roman, not even a slave, could castrate himself &quot;in honour of the Goddess&quot; without penalty; in 101 BC, a slave who had done so was exiled. Augustus selected priests from among his own freedmen to supervise Magna Mater&#x27;s cult, and brought it under Imperial control. Claudius introduced the senior priestly office of Archigallus, who was not a eunuch and held full Roman citizenship.

The religiously lawful circumstances for a Gallus&#x27;s self-castration remain unclear; some may have performed the operation on the Dies Sanguinis (&quot;Day of Blood&quot;) in Cybele and Attis&#x27; March festival. Pliny describes the procedure as relatively safe, but it is not known at what stage in their career the Galli performed it, or exactly what was removed, or even whether all Galli performed it. Some Galli devoted themselves to their goddess for most of their lives, maintained relationships with relatives and partners throughout, and eventually retired from service. Galli remained a presence in Roman cities well into the Empire&#x27;s Christian era. Some decades after Christianity became the sole Imperial religion, St. Augustine saw Galli &quot;parading through the squares and streets of Carthage, with oiled hair and powdered faces, languid limbs and feminine gait, demanding even from the tradespeople the means of continuing to live in disgrace&quot;.

== Temples ==

=== Greece ===
The earliest known temple for Cybele in the Greek world is the Daskalopetra monument on Chios, which dates to the sixth or early fifth centuries BC. In Greek, a temple to Cybele was often called a &quot;Metroon&quot;. Several Metroa were established in Greek cities from the fifth century BC onward. The Metroon at Athens was established in the early fifth century BC on the west side of the Athenian Agora, next to the Boule (town council). It was a rectangular building with three rooms and an altar in front. It was destroyed during the Persian sack of Athens in 480 BC, but repaired around 460 BC. The cult was deeply integrated into civic life; the Metroon was used as the state archive and Cybele was one of the four main deities, to whom serving councillors sacrificed, along with Zeus, Athena, and Apollo. The highly influential fifth-century BC statue of Cybele enthroned by Agoracritus was located in this building. The building was rebuilt around 150 BC, with separate rooms for cult worship and archival storage, and it remained in use until Late Antiquity. A second Metroon in the Athenian suburb of Agrae was associated with the Eleusinian Mysteries. At the end of the fifth century BC, a Metroon was established at Olympia. It is a small hexastyle temple, the third to be built on the site after the archaic Heraion and the mid-fifth century Temple of Zeus. In the Roman period it was used for the Imperial cult. In the fourth century, further Metroa are attested at Smyrna and Colophon, where they also served as state archives, as in Athens.

=== Rome and its provinces ===
Magna Mater&#x27;s temple stood high on the slope of the Palatine, overlooking the valley of the Circus Maximus and facing the temple of Ceres on the slopes of the Aventine. It was accessible via a long upward flight of steps from a flattened area or proscenium below, where the goddess&#x27;s festival games and plays were staged. At the top of the steps was a statue of the enthroned goddess, wearing a mural crown and attended by lions. Her altar stood at the base of the steps, at the proscenium&#x27;s edge. The first temple was damaged by fire in 111 BC, and was repaired or rebuilt. It burnt down in the early Imperial era, and was restored by Augustus; it burned down again soon after, and Augustus rebuilt it in more sumptuous style; the Ara Pietatis relief shows its pediment. The goddess is represented by her empty throne and crown, flanked by two figures of Attis reclining on tympanons; and by two lions who eat from bowls, as if tamed by her unseen presence. The scene probably represents a &quot;sellisternium&quot;, a form of banquet usually reserved for goddesses, in accordance with &quot;Greek rite&quot; as practiced in Rome. This feast was probably held within the building, with attendance reserved for the aristocratic sponsors of the goddesses rites; the flesh of her sacrificial animal provided their meat.

From at least 139 AD, Rome&#x27;s port at Ostia, the site of the goddess&#x27;s arrival, had a fully developed sanctuary to Magna Mater and Attis, served by a local Archigallus and college of &quot;dendrophores&quot; (the ritual tree-bearers of &quot;Holy Week&quot;).

Ground preparations for the building of St. Peter&#x27;s basilica on the Vatican Hill uncovered a shrine, known as the Phrygianum, with some 24 dedications to Magna Mater and Attis. Many are now lost, but most that survive were dedicated by high-status Romans after a taurobolium sacrifice to Magna Mater. None of these dedicants were priests of the Magna Mater or Attis, and several held priesthoods of one or more different cults.

Near Setif (Mauretania), the &quot;dendrophores&quot; and the faithful (&quot;religiosi&quot;) restored their temple of Cybele and Attis after a disastrous fire in 288 AD. Lavish new fittings paid for by the private group included the silver statue of Cybele and her processional chariot; the latter received a new canopy with tassels in the form of fir cones. Cybele drew ire from Christians throughout the Empire; when St. Theodore of Amasea was granted time to recant his beliefs, he spent it by burning a temple of Cybele instead.

==Myths, theology, and cosmology==
Rome characterised the Phrygians as barbaric, effeminate orientals, prone to excess. While some Roman sources explained Attis&#x27; death as punishment for his excess devotion to Magna Mater, others saw it as punishment for his lack of devotion, or outright disloyalty. Only one account of Attis and Cybele (related by Pausanias) omits any suggestion of a personal or sexual relationship between them; Attis achieves divinity through his support of &quot;Meter&quot;&#x27;s cult, is killed by a boar sent by Zeus, who is envious of the cult&#x27;s success, and is rewarded for his commitment with godhood. 

The most complex, vividly detailed, and lurid accounts of Magna Mater and Attis were produced as anti-pagan polemic in the late 4th century by the Christian apologist Arnobius, who presented their cults as a repulsive combination of blood-bath, incest, and sexual orgy, derived from the myths of Agdistis. This has been presumed the most ancient, violent, and authentically Phrygian version of myth and cult, closely following an otherwise lost orthodox, approved version preserved by the priest-kings at Pessinous and imported to Rome. Arnobius claimed several scholarly sources as his authority; but the oldest versions are also the most fragmentary and, during an interval of several centuries, apt to diverge into whatever version suited a new audience, or potentially, new acolytes. Greek versions of the myth recall those concerning the mortal Adonis and his divine lovers, - Aphrodite, who had some claim to cult as a &#x27;Mother of all&quot;, or her rival for Adonis&#x27; love, Persephone - showing the grief and anger of a powerful goddess, mourning the helpless loss of her mortal beloved.

The emotionally charged literary version presented in Catullus 63 follows Attis&#x27; initially ecstatic self-castration into exhausted sleep, and a waking realisation of all he has lost through his emotional slavery to a domineering and utterly self-centered goddess; it is narrated with a rising sense of isolation, oppression, and despair, virtually an inversion of the liberation promised by Cybele&#x27;s Anatolian cult. Contemporaneous with this, more or less, Dionysius of Halicarnassos pursues the idea that the &quot;Phrygian degeneracy&quot; of the Galli, personified in Attis, be removed from the Megalensia to reveal the dignified, &quot;truly Roman&quot; festival rites of the Magna Mater. Somewhat later, Vergil expresses the same deep tension and ambivalence regarding Rome&#x27;s claimed Phrygian, Trojan ancestors, when he describes his hero Aeneas as a perfumed, effeminate Gallus, a half-man who would, however, &quot;rid himself of the effeminacy of the Oriental in order to fulfill his destiny as the ancestor of Rome.&quot; This would entail him and his followers shedding their Phrygian language and culture, to follow the virile example of the Latins. In Lucretius&#x27; description of the goddess and her acolytes in Rome, her priests provide an object lesson in the self-destruction wrought when passion and devotion exceed rational bounds; a warning, rather than an offer. 

For Lucretius, Roman Magna Mater &quot;symbolised the world order&quot;: her image held reverentially aloft in procession signifies the Earth, which &quot;hangs in the air&quot;. She is the mother of all, ultimately the Mother of humankind, and the yoked lions that draw her chariot show an otherwise ferocious offspring&#x27;s duty of obedience to the parent. She herself is uncreated, and thus essentially separate from and independent of her creations.

In the early Imperial era, the Roman poet Manilius inserts Cybele as the thirteenth deity of an otherwise symmetrical, classic Greco-Roman zodiac, in which each of twelve zodiacal houses (represented by particular constellations) is ruled by one of twelve deities, known in Greece as the Twelve Olympians and in Rome as the Di Consentes. Manilius has Cybele and Jupiter as co-rulers of Leo (the Lion), in astrological opposition to Juno, who rules Aquarius. Modern scholarship remarks that as Cybele&#x27;s Leo rises above the horizon, Taurus (the Bull) sets; the lion thus dominates the bull. Some of the possible Greek models for Cybele&#x27;s Megalensia festival include representations of lions attacking and dominating bulls. The festival date coincided, more or less, with events of the Roman agricultural calendar (around April 12) when farmers were advised to dig their vineyards, break up the soil, sow millet, &quot;and – curiously apposite, given the nature of the Mother&#x27;s priests – castrate cattle and other animals.&quot;

==In popular culture==

The Paseo del Prado axis in Madrid has as one of its extremes the Plaza de Cibeles (&quot;Cybele&#x27;s Square&quot;) with the Fountain of Cybele at its center.
Fans of Real Madrid CF and the Spanish football national team celebrate their triumphs around the fountain, thus establishing the goddess as a symbol of Madrid and the Real Madrid football club.

<text>The Big 12 Conference is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States. It consists of 16 full-member universities (3 private universities and 13 public universities) in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. It is headquartered in Irving, Texas,

The Big 12 is a member of the Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for all sports. Its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A), the higher of two levels of NCAA Division I football competition.

The Big 12 is one of the Power Four conferences, the four highest-earning and most historically successful FBS football conferences. Power Four conferences are guaranteed at least one bid to a New Year&#x27;s Six bowl game and have been granted exemptions from certain NCAA rules.

The Big 12 is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Brett Yormark became the commissioner on August 1, 2022.

The Big 12 was founded in February 1994. All eight members of the former Big Eight Conference joined with half the members of the former Southwest Conference (Baylor, Texas, Texas A&amp;M, and Texas Tech) to form the conference, with play beginning in 1996.

BYU, Cincinnati, Houston, and UCF joined the conference for the 2023–2024 season. The next season Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, and Utah joined the conference and Texas and Oklahoma left as part of a more extensive NCAA conference realignment.

== History ==

The Big 12 Conference was founded in February 1994. All eight members of the former Big Eight Conference joined with half the members of the former Southwest Conference (Texas, Texas A&amp;M, Baylor and Texas Tech) to form the conference, with play beginning in 1996.

The Big 12 does not claim the Big Eight&#x27;s history as its own, even though it was essentially the Big Eight plus four of the Texas universities.

The Big 12 began athletic play in fall 1996, with the Texas Tech vs. Kansas State football game being the first-ever sports event staged by the conference.

From its formation until 2011, its 12 members competed in two divisions in most sports. The two Oklahoma universities and the four Texas universities formed the South Division, while the other six universities of the former Big Eight formed the North Division.

Between 2011 and 2012 four charter members left the conference:
* Colorado
* Missouri
* Nebraska
* Texas A&amp;M

In 2012, two universities joined the conference:
* TCU
* West Virginia

On July 26, 2021, Oklahoma and Texas notified the Big 12 Conference that the two universities did not wish to extend their grant of television rights beyond the 2024–25 athletic year. On July 27, 2021, Oklahoma and Texas sent a joint letter to the Southeastern Conference requesting an invitation for membership beginning July 1, 2025. On July 29, 2021, the 14 presidents and chancellors of SEC member universities voted unanimously to invite Oklahoma and Texas to join the SEC. The following day, the Texas Board of Regents and Oklahoma Board of Regents each accepted the invitation to join the SEC from July 1, 2025.

On September 10, 2021, the Big 12 announced that invitations had been extended to and accepted by BYU (a football independent and member of the non-football West Coast Conference) and three members of the American Athletic Conference in Cincinnati, UCF, and Houston. These moves, combined with the impending departure of Oklahoma and Texas, would once again increase the Big 12&#x27;s membership to twelve schools. All four schools began competing in Big 12 athletics beginning in summer of 2023. BYU had initially announced that it would join in 2023, and Houston indicated it could do so as well. On June 10, 2022, The American and its three departing members announced a buyout agreement that allowed those schools to join the Big 12 in 2023.

On February 9, 2023, Oklahoma and Texas announced they had reached a settlement with the conference that allowed them to join the SEC on July 1, 2024.

On July 27, 2023, Colorado, a former member of the Big 12, announced it would rejoin the conference from the Pac-12 beginning in the 2024–25 academic year. The following week, Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah announced they would leave the Pac-12 for the Big 12, also effective for the 2024–25 academic year.

== Distinctive elements ==
=== Population base and markets ===
The largest media markets represented by the Big 12 are, ranked nationally:
* Dallas-Fort Worth (5th)
* Houston (6th)
* Phoenix (11th)
* Orlando (16th)
* Denver (17th)
* Salt Lake City (27th)
* San Antonio (31st)
* Kansas City (34th)
* Cincinnati (37th)
* Oklahoma City (47th)
* Tulsa (62nd)
* Tucson (65th)
* Des Moines (67th)
* Wichita (72nd)

Although West Virginia University is based out of Morgantown, West Virginia (officially part of the Pittsburgh (26th) media market), the TV market encompasses the majority of West Virginia&#x27;s TV viewership and also reaches well into Western Pennsylvania.

Kansas State University is in Manhattan, Kansas, which is part of the Topeka, Kansas media market, but it is close to the Wichita market, which encompasses two-thirds of the state (stretching to the border with Colorado), including the cities of Dodge City, Garden City, Hutchinson and Salina.

While the University of Kansas is in Lawrence, Kansas, it has close proximity to the Kansas City television market, increasing the base into western Missouri.


=== Grant of Rights ===
Member universities granted their first and second tier sports media rights to the conference for the length of their current TV deals. The Grant of Rights (GOR) deal with the leagues&#x27; TV contracts ensures that &quot;if a Big 12 school leaves for another league in the next 13 years, that school&#x27;s media rights, including revenue, would remain with the Big 12 and not its new conference&quot;.

GOR is seen by league members as a &quot;foundation of stability&quot; and allowed the Big 12 to be &quot;positioned with one of the best media rights arrangements in collegiate sports, providing the conference and its members unprecedented revenue growth, and sports programming over two networks.&quot; All members agreed to the GOR and later agreed to extend the initial 6-year deal to 13 years to correspond to the length of their TV contracts.

Prior to this agreement, the Big Ten and Pac-12 also had similar GOR agreements. The Big 12 subsequently assisted the ACC in drafting its GOR agreement. Three of the four major conferences now have such agreements, with the SEC the only exception.

=== Tier 3 events ===

The Big 12 is the only major conference that allows members to monetize TV rights for tier 3 events in football and men&#x27;s basketball. This allows individual Big 12 member institutions to create tier 3 deals that include TV rights for one home football game and four home men&#x27;s basketball games per season. Tier 3 rights exist for other sports as well, but these are not unique to the Big 12. The unique arrangement potentially allows Big 12 members to remain some of college sports&#x27; highest revenue earners. Other conferences&#x27; cable deals are subject to value reductions based on how people acquire cable programming; Big 12 universities&#x27; tier 3 deals are exempt. Texas alone earned more than $150 million of that total from their Longhorn Network before it was shut down with its move to the SEC.

As of 2022, all of the Big 12&#x27;s tier 3 rights are held by ESPN; it bought the tier 3 rights to most Big 12 teams (besides Oklahoma) in 2019, moving the events exclusively to ESPN+. The Oklahoma Sooners retained an agreement with Bally Sports Oklahoma (which distributed its football game via pay-per-view) until 2022, when it also sold its rights to ESPN+. Prior to its departure to the SEC, ESPN also ran a dedicated cable network for the Texas Longhorns known as Longhorn Network, as a joint venture between the university and Learfield.

=== Business partnerships and innovation ===
The Big 12 has a sponsorship rights partnership with Learfield IMG College. The Big 12 announced on September 9, 2022, that it appointed WME Sports and IMG Media, Endeavor companies, to facilitate its global content and commercial strategy. Commissioner Brett Yormark stated &quot;We have aligned with a best-in-class team to build a best-in-class business strategy for the Conference&quot;. November 14, 2022 Big 12 formed a comprehensive business advisor board composed of over three dozen entrepreneurial icons and respective industry leaders. From the likes of Monte Lipman the Founder/CEO Republic Records, Steve Stoute Founder/CEO UnitedMasters &amp; Translation, Mark Shapiro President of Endeavor, Gary Vaynerchuk’s VaynerMedia, singer Garth Brooks, NBA legend Jason Kidd, Keith Sheldon President of Entertainment for Hard Rock Cafe International, and Ross Levinsohn Chairman and CEO - The Arena Group &amp; Sports Illustrated.

The Big 12 partnered with creative agency Translation to help build a more contemporary audience and brand.
Soon after Big 12 Conference made a deal with A Bathing Ape (BAPE) for Championship games. The Conference and BAPE worked together to create limited-edition clothing and a camouflaged Big 12 logo throughout the stadium, arena, and uniforms.

The Big 12 has 11 official corporate partners: Allstate, Children’s Health, Dr Pepper, Gatorade, Grand Caliber, Old Trapper, On Location, Phillips 66, Sonic Hard Seltzer, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Tickets For Less. There are dozens of other companies engaged as sponsors of the conference.

==== Conference Pro Day ====
On March 15, 2023, before the NFL Draft, the Big 12 announced the first of its kind across all college conferences, being a conference-wide Pro Day. Instead of schools hosting separate pro days for their football players, there will be only one conference-wide scouting event before the 2024 NFL draft. The event will be held at the Dallas Cowboys training complex, Ford Center at The Star. What essentially would be a conference version of the NFL combine, the Pro Day would be televised on NFL Network.

==== Hoops in the Park ====
In March, the Big 12 Conference announced a partnership with the legendary Rucker Park for a community engagement event. In June the event was officially announced as &quot;Big 12 Hoops in the Park&quot;, to host men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s summer exhibition games. Throughout the event, the Big 12 is also preparing a number of entertainment activities and community engagements. The activities include youth clinics, meet-and-greets, live music, and food.

==== Mexico ====
Early June 2023, the &quot;Big 12 Mexico&quot; was announced, which will include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, baseball, basketball, and football games and an international media rights strategy. The Big 12 Mexico will debut in December 2024 with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball games between Kansas and Houston at the Arena CDMX in Mexico City. The Big 12 will also consider hosting a football bowl game in Monterrey beginning in 2026. This would be the first-ever bowl game in Mexico.

== Conference annual revenue distribution ==
Conference revenue comes mostly from television contracts, bowl games, the NCAA, merchandise, licensing and conference-hosted sporting events. The Conference distributes revenue annually to member institutions. From 1996 to 2011, 57 percent of revenue was allotted equally; while 43 percent was based upon the number of football and men&#x27;s basketball television appearances and other factors. In 2011, the distribution was 76 percent equal and 24 percent based on television appearances. Changing the arrangement requires a unanimous vote; as a Big 12 member, Nebraska and Texas A&amp;M had withheld support for more equitable revenue distribution.

With this model, larger universities can receive more revenue because they appear more often on television. In 2006, for example, Texas received $10.2 million, 44% more than Baylor University&#x27;s $7.1 million.

Big 12 revenue was generally less than other BCS conferences; this was due in part to television contracts signed with Fox Sports Net (four years for $48 million) and ABC/ESPN (eight years for $480 million).

In 2011, the Big 12 announced a new 13-year media rights deal with Fox that would ensure that every Big 12 home football game is televised, as well as greatly increasing coverage of women&#x27;s basketball, conference championships and other sports. The deal, valued at an estimated $1.1 billion, runs until 2025. In 2012, the conference announced a new agreement with Fox and ESPN, replacing the current ABC/ESPN deal, to immediately increase national media broadcasts of football and increase conference revenue; the new deal was estimated to be worth $2.6 billion through the 2025 expiration. The two deals pushed the conference per-university payout to approximately $20 million per year, while separating third-tier media rights into separate deals for each university; such contracts secured an additional $6 million to $20 million per university annually. The per-university payout under the deal is expected to reach $44 million, according to Commissioner Bob Bowlsby.

In 2022, the conference renewed its media rights with ESPN and Fox Sports for six seasons starting in 2025–26, with an estimated US$380 million average annual fee.

== Athletic department revenue by school ==

Total revenue includes ticket sales, contributions and donations, rights and licensing, student fees, school funds and all other sources including TV income, camp income, concessions, and novelties.

Total expenses includes coach and staff salaries, scholarships, buildings and grounds, maintenance, utilities and rental fees, recruiting, team travel, equipment and uniforms, conference dues, and insurance.

The following table shows institutional reporting to the United States Department of Education as shown on the DOE Equity in Athletics website for the 2022–23 academic year.

=== National team titles by institution ===
The national championships listed below are as of the January 22, 2025. Football, Helms, pre-NCAA competition and overall equestrian titles are included in the total, but excluded from the column listing NCAA and AIAW titles.
† Co-ed sports include fencing (since 1990), rifle, and skiing (since 1983). Team fencing championships before 1990 and team skiing championships before 1983 were awarded as men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s championships and are counted here as such.
 Includes titles won under the DGWS, predecessor of the AIAW.

===Most recent NCAA championship===


=== National championships ===
The following is a list of all NCAA, equestrian, and college football championships won by teams that were representing the Big 12 Conference in NCAA-recognized sports at the time of their championship. The most recent Big 12 team to win a national title is BYU men&#x27;s cross country in 2024, along with being the most recent team to win a national title while representing the Big 12. Only two years of the Big 12&#x27;s existence has the conference not won at least one team National Title, 2007 and 2020. However, in 2020 multiple National Championships were not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

One former member of the conference did not win a National Championship while a member of the Big 12, Missouri. Original members Kansas State and Iowa State have not won a championship while representing the Big 12. The only national championships won by 2012 arrivals TCU and West Virginia since joining the Big 12 have been in rifle, a sport that the conference has never sponsored. Of the 2023 arrivals, Houston, UCF, and Cincinnati have not won a championship in the Big 12, but BYU has won in women’s and men’s cross country.

Men&#x27;s swimming has the most overall championships with 10, while men&#x27;s golf has the most different schools win a championship with 4.

=== Conference champions ===
The Conference sponsors 23 sports, 10 men&#x27;s and 13 women&#x27;s.

In football, divisional titles were awarded based on regular-season conference results, with the teams with the best conference records from the North and South playing in the Big 12 Championship Game from 1996 to 2010. Baseball, basketball, softball, tennis and women&#x27;s soccer titles are awarded in both regular-season and tournament play. Cross country, golf, gymnastics, swimming and diving, track and field, and wrestling titles are awarded during an annual meet of participating teams. The volleyball title is awarded based on regular-season play.

&lt;section end=Big12Champs /&gt;

== Football ==
The first football game in conference play was Texas Tech vs. Kansas State in 1996, won by Kansas State, 21–14.

From 1996 to 2010, Big 12 Conference teams played eight conference games a season. Each team faced all five opponents within its own division and three teams from the opposite division. Inter-divisional play was a &quot;three-on, three-off&quot; system, where teams would play three teams from the other division on a home-and-home basis for two seasons, and then play the other three foes from the opposite side for a two-year home-and-home.

This format came under considerable criticism, especially from Nebraska and Oklahoma, who were denied a yearly match between two of college football&#x27;s most storied programs. The Nebraska-Oklahoma rivalry was one of the most intense in college football history. (Until 2006, the teams had never met in the Big 12 Championship.) Due to the departure of Nebraska and Colorado in 2011, the Big 12 eliminated the divisions (and championship game) and instituted a nine-game round-robin format. With the advent of the College Football Playoff committee looking at teams&#x27; strength of schedule for picking the four playoff teams, on December 8, 2015, the Big 12 announced an annual requirement for all Big 12 teams to schedule a non-conference game against a team from the four other Power Five conferences (plus Notre Dame). Per Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby: &quot;Schedule strength is a key component in CFP Selection Committee deliberations. This move will strengthen the resumes for all Big 12 teams. Coupled with the nine-game full round robin Conference schedule our teams play, it will not only benefit the teams at the top of our standings each season, but will impact the overall strength of the Conference.&quot; The Big 12 has made it to the Playoffs 6 times from 2014 to 2023. Three Big 12 participants have made it to the playoff: Oklahoma in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019; Texas in 2023; and TCU in 2022.

=== Championship game ===

The Big 12 Championship Game game was approved by all members except Nebraska. It was held each year, commencing with the first match in the 1996 season at the Trans World Dome in St. Louis. It pitted the division champions against each other after the regular season was completed.

Following the 2008 game, the event was moved to the new Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, being played there in 2009 and 2010. In 2010, the Sooners defeated the Cornhuskers 23–20.

After 2010, the game was moved to Arlington for 2011, 2012, and 2013. However, the decision became moot following the 2010 season because the league lacked sufficient members.

In April 2015, the ACC and the Big 12 developed new rules for the NCAA to deregulate conference championship games. The measure passed on January 14, 2016, allowing a conference with fewer than 12 teams to stage a championship game that does not count against the FBS limit of 12 regular-season games under either of the following circumstances:
* The game involves the top two teams following a full round-robin conference schedule.
* The game involves two divisional winners, each having played a full round-robin schedule in its division.

Under the first criterion, the Big 12 championship game resumed at the conclusion of the 2017 regular season, and is played during the first weekend of December, the time all other FBS conference championship games are played.

=== Bowl affiliations ===
The following were bowl games for the Big 12 for the 2022 season.

== Rivalries ==
The Big 12 is known for rivalries (primarily in football) that mostly predate the conference. The Kansas-Missouri rivalry was the longest running, the longest west of the Mississippi, and the second longest in college football, dating back to the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association before evolving into the Big Eight. It was played 119 times before Missouri left the Big 12. As of October 2012, the University of Kansas&#x27; athletic department had not accepted Missouri&#x27;s invitations to play inter-conference rivalry games, putting the rivalry on hold. Sports clubs sponsored by the two universities continued to play each other. Kansas and Missouri renewed the rivalry in men&#x27;s basketball starting in December 2021, and have announced that they will meet again in football in 2025.

The rivalry between TCU and Baylor, known as the Revivalry is also one of the longest running in college football, with the two universities having played each other — largely as Southwest Conference members — 120 times since 1899. Following the 2024 game, TCU leads the series 59–54–7.

Some of the football rivalries between Big 12 universities include:
== Men&#x27;s Basketball ==
As of the end of the 2023–2024 season, nine current Big 12 members are among the teams with the most wins and/or the highest win percentage in NCAA Division 1 men&#x27;s basketball: Kansas (#2 in wins, #3 in percentage), Cincinnati (#12 wins, #19 percentage), Utah (#15 wins, #22 percentage), BYU (#17 wins, #31 percentage), Arizona (#19 wins, #10 percentage), West Virginia (#20 wins, #36 percentage), Houston (#37 percentage), Oklahoma State (#39 wins), and Kansas State (#42 wins). On the list of the most Final Four appearances, Kansas is #5 and Cincinnati, Houston, and Oklahoma State are all tied (with several other schools) at #11.

From 1996 to 2011, standings in conference play were not split among divisions, although the schedule was structured as if they were. Teams played a home-and-home against teams within their divisions and a single game against teams from the opposite division for a total of 16 conference games. After Nebraska and Colorado left, Big 12 play transitioned to an 18-game, double round robin schedule. When the conference temporarily expanded to 14 members for the 2023–24 season, the 18-game schedule remained, but the double round-robin was discontinued in favor of a new scheduling formula.

Starting in 2024–25, the Big 12 will go to a 20-game schedule. Each team will face five opponents at home, five opponents on the road, and five opponents both home and away.

=== Conference champions ===

Kansas has the most Big 12 titles, winning or sharing the regular-season title 20 times in the league&#x27;s 25 seasons, including 13 straight from 2004–05 to 2016–17. The 2002 Jayhawks became the first, and so far only, team to complete an undefeated Big 12 regular season, going 16–0. Though rematches between Big 12 regular season co-champions have happened in that year&#x27;s Big 12 tournament, none have met in the ensuing NCAA Tournament.

In 2021–22, Kansas won the seeding tiebreaker over Baylor for the Big 12 Tournament, as Kansas had gone 1–1 against third place team Texas Tech, while Baylor had been swept by Texas Tech.

== Baseball ==

All current Big 12 members sponsor baseball except Colorado, which never sponsored baseball during its first conference tenure and still does not sponsor the sport, and Iowa State, which dropped the sport after the 2001 season. All other former Big 12 members sponsored the sport throughout their tenures in the conference.



=== NCAA tournament performance ===
Totals through the end of the 2024 season.
== Broadcasting and media rights ==
The Big 12&#x27;s media rights are controlled primarily by ESPN (ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, and ESPN+) and Fox Sports (Fox and FS1). Since 2012, ESPN has sublicensed college basketball games to CBS Sports. Beginning in 2025, ESPN will sublicense college football and basketball games to TNT Sports.

=== 2012 media deal ===
On September 7, 2012, the Big 12 announced a 13-year agreement with ESPN and Fox valued at $2.6 billion in total. ESPN and Fox split college football rights, while the basketball inventory was held by ESPN with sublicensing options for CBS Sports and Fox Sports. The agreement also included a grant of rights for all current Big 12 teams over the period of the contract.

In addition to the national agreement, each Big 12 university maintained the right to sell its &quot;third-tier&quot; covering selected events per-season (including one football game, basketball games, and other events outside of those sports). The third-tier rights to the Texas Longhorns are held through a channel dedicated to the team — Longhorn Network — which is operated by ESPN. In 2019, ESPN announced that it would acquire the third-tier rights to all Big 12 teams through 2024–25 (excluding Oklahoma and Texas, which are still under long-term contracts with ESPN+ and Longhorn Network respectively), and place their content on its subscription streaming service ESPN+. ESPN also acquired exclusive rights to all future Big 12 football championship games, replacing the previous alternation between ESPN and Fox.

=== 2025 extension deal ===
On October 30, 2022, the Big 12 announced that it had reached early broadcast deal to renew rights with ESPN network (includes ABC rights) and Fox. It is a six-year media rights agreement worth a total of $2.3 billion, but also reportedly includes an &quot;escalator clause&quot; that will raise the value of the contracts if only Power Five schools are added. By striking a deal prior to the exclusive negotiating window with ESPN and Fox, the Big 12 managed to achieve several of its primary objectives of stability and security, including the ability to consult its member schools to seek an extended grant of rights and potential future conference expansion. Fox&#x27;s deal also places a slate of Big 12 college basketball games on Fox Sports for the first time.

<text>Agdistis () is a deity of Greek, Roman, and Anatolian mythology who was a Hermaphrodite, having been born with both male and female reproductive organs. The deity was closely associated with the Phrygian goddess Cybele.

==Mythology==
The geographer Pausanias (7.17.10–12) records the following story about Agdistis, which he says the people of Pessinus told. Zeus, while asleep, spilled some of his semen on the earth, which in time gave rise to a deity (&quot;δαίμων&quot;) with both male and female sexual organs called Agdistis. Now the other gods, afraid of Agdistis, cut off the male genitalia, and from this grew an almond tree. The daughter of the Phrygian river-god Sangarius picked an almond from this tree and placing it in her bosom she became pregnant. She gave birth to a son Attis who was abandoned in the wild. Attis was cared for by a male goat, and grew to be a divinely beautiful youth and Agdistis fell in love with the boy. But Attis was sent to Pessinus to be married to the king&#x27;s daughter, and when the marriage hymn was sung Agdistis appeared, and driven mad both Attis and the king castrated themselves. Attis died from his wound but Agdistis, repenting for what had been done to Attis, persuaded Zeus that Attis&#x27;s body should never decay. In another passage (1.4.5), Pausanias tells us that a mountain at Pessinus was called &quot;Mount Agdistis&quot;, and that Attis was said to be buried there.

Another much longer version of Agdistis&#x27;s story, was apparently handed down by Timotheus, an Athenian Eumolpid (c. 300 BC). According to Arnobius, an early fourth-century Christian apologist: 
Arnobius goes on to recount the story as follows. There was a rock in Phrygia called Agdus, from which this Great Mother was fashioned. Now Jupiter (the Roman Zeus) desired to have intercourse with her, but unable to do so, let his seed fall upon the rock. From this rock was eventually born Agdistis, named so after Agdus the mothering rock. In Agdistis was:
After the gods, in their councils, had often considered what could be done to curb Agdistis, Liber (the Roman Dionysus), taking the task upon himself, caused Agdistis to be become drunk and fall fast asleep. With a snare Liber tied Agdistis&#x27;s foot to his genitals. When Agdistis finally woke up and stood, he tore his own genitals off. And from these and the immense flow of blood upon the earth grew a pomegranate tree. Now Sangarius&#x27;s daughter Nana placed one of the fruits from the tree in her bosom, and as above, became pregnant with the boy Attis. When the pregnancy is discovered by her father, Nana is shut up in order to starve her to death. But she is kept alive by the Mother of the gods, Attis is born, and Sangarius orders the child exposed. As before the child is found and nurtured, and grows to be a surpassingly beautiful youth, whom the Mother of the gods loved &quot;exceedingly&quot;. And, as Attis grew up, Agdistis was his constant secret companion:
Eventually, however, a drunken Attis confesses his relationship with Agdistis, and in order to save the youth from &quot;so disgraceful an intimacy&quot;, Midas the king of Pessinus resolves to give Attis his daughter in marriage. On the day of the wedding, Midas has the gates of the city closed, so that nothing might disrupt it. But the Mother of the gods knows Attis&#x27; fate and that he would never be safe if he married. So, wishing to prevent the marriage, she &quot;raised&quot; the city &quot;walls with her head&quot; and entered the city. And so too entered Agdistis. In a jealous rage, Agdistis bursts in upon the wedding filling everyone with &quot;frenzied madness&quot; which causes Attis to castrate himself and die. The Mother of the gods gathered up the severed genitals and buried them, and Agdistis and the Mother of the gods join together in the funeral wailings. Agdistis pleads for Jupiter to restore Attis to life. Jupiter refuses, but does grant that Attis&#x27; body will never decay, his hair should continue to grow, and his little fingers should live, and ever move. Agdistis took the body to Pessinus, where it was consecrated and honored with yearly rites.

==Association with Cybele==
Agdistis&#x27;s story comes from the Phrygian city of Pessinus, a cultic center of Cybele the Great Mother of the gods, where, according to Strabo, the two goddesses were identified. However, even when Agdistis is considered to be distinct from Cybele, such as in Arnobius&#x27; account above, the two are closely associated, with Agdistis often being interpreted as a &quot;doublet&quot; or &quot;doubling&quot; of the Great Mother.

Agdistis held a special place in the Phrygian religious traditions surrounding Cybele. The accounts of Agdistis given above revolve around Attis who was the young consort of Cybele and prototype of her eunuch priesthood. And Agistis&#x27;s story was a mythic &quot;aition&quot;, or origin myth, which was supposed to explain why Cybele&#x27;s priests were eunuchs. Although the Great Mother does not figure directly in Pausanias&#x27; account, she figures throughout Arnobius&#x27;, seemingly in parallel with Agdistis, where they both love Attis, enter the closed city and disrupt the wedding, and join together in mourning his death.

While the two goddesses in Arnobius&#x27; account share such things as their intimate relationship with Attis, and their ability to inspire &quot;μανία&quot; (&#x27;mania&#x27;) in the wedding participants, there are however differences. The most notable difference being Agdistis&#x27; androgynous nature.

==Cult==
Agdistis&#x27; main cultic center was apparently the sacred city of Pessinus. From there her cult presumably spread to other places in Anatolia, as well as to Greek islands in the Aegean Sea, mainland Greece, Crimea, and Egypt.

In Anatolia, an inscription from Iconium invokes Agdistis, alongside Apollo and Artemis, as among those gods considered to be &quot;saviors&quot; (the so-called (&quot;theoi sōtēres&quot;), and an altar at Sizma represents both Agdistis and the Great Mother. There was also a religious community at Lydian Philadelphia, which enforced a strict moral code, based at a sanctuary of Agdistis (1st century BC). From Sardis, a copy of a 4th-century BC degree forbids the priests of Zeus from attendance at the &quot;mysteries&quot; of Agdistis.

Her name appears on a dedication from the Ancient Greek town of Methymna on the East Aegean island of Lesbos, off the coast of Anatolia, as well as on a marble base (c. 2nd century BC?), found on the mid-Aegean Greek island of Paros.

Evidence of Agdistis&#x27; cult is found in mainland Greece, as early as the 4th–3rd centuries BC. A relief of Agdistis and Attis, whose identities are secured by inscription, is found on a marble votive stele (late 4th or early 3rd-century), from the Metroon in the Piraeus the port of ancient Athens (Antikensammlung Berlin SK 1612). It depicts two figures. On the left is a young male in oriental dress sitting on a rock facing right. In front of him on the right stands a female figure facing left, holding a &quot;tympanum&quot; in her left hand down at her side, and offering a cup in her right hand to the youth who holds out his right hand to receive it. The votive dedication reads: &quot;Timothea to Angdistis [an alternate spelling] and Attis on behalf of her children according to command&quot;. From a copy of a public decree (1st-century BC?) kept in the Metroon of Athens, we know that she also a had a sanctuary of her own at Rhamnus, an ancient Greek city in Attica situated on the coast, overlooking the Euboean Strait.

Her name also appears on a dedication from Panticapaeum, an ancient Greek city on the eastern shore of Crimea, and, in Egypt, in an inscription recording the construction of a &quot;naos&quot; and its &quot;temenos&quot; (temple and temple precinct), during the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus (284–246 BC).

While some of the occurrences of the name &quot;Agdistis&quot; are found together, and in the same context, with the Great Mother (such as in the altar at Sizma) and thus the two goddesses can be assumed to have been considered distinct, most are not. In such cases, where the name is found alone, it is impossible to know whether it was being used as one of the many epithets of the Great Mother, or instead used as a reference to Agdistis as a separate goddess. In either case, it is also unknown to what extant, if any, Agdistis&#x27; peculiar hermaphroditic nature informed Agdists&#x27; cult practice.

There is also epigraphic evidence that Agdistis was considered to be &quot;a goddess with benevolent and healing traits&quot;.

==Androgyny==
Both Pausanias and Arnobius present Agdistis as being born an hermaphrodite, whom the gods caused to be castrated. According to Pausanias this was because the gods were afraid of Agdistis, while Arnobius makes clear this fear was a reaction to Agdistis&#x27; androgyny, which produced in her/him &quot;a fierceness of disposition beyond control, lust made furious&quot;, derived &quot;from both sexes!&quot;. Agdistis is also intimately associated with the boy Attis, who, like the Agdistis in Arnobius&#x27; version, self-castrates. The central theme of these accounts have been taken by some to be &quot;the myth of the primeval Androgyne&quot;, a theme also seen to be present in &quot;other Phrygian religious traditions&quot;.

Attempts have been made to connect Agdistis to other Phrygian deities who were also androgynous. Her name has been conjectured to be the Greek form of the name (possibly &quot;Andistis&quot;) of an earlier Phrygian divine androgyne.

==Ullikummi==

Parallels have been seen between Agdistis, and the Hurrian monster Ullikummi. The story of Ullikummi is found in a Hittite text called the &quot;Song of Ullikummi&quot;, where like Agdistis, Ullikummi is born from a rock that has been impregnated by a god, presents a challenge to the ruling gods, and the gods &quot;cut&quot; Ullikummi, severing him from his strength. As Walter Burkert has noted, the beginning of the &quot;Song of Ullikummi&quot; &quot;corresponds nearly sentence for sentence&quot; with the beginning of Arnobius&#x27; account (5.5–6) of Agdistis&#x27;s story:

<text>In Greek mythology, Agelasta (, , &quot;smile-less&quot;) was the name of the stone on which Demeter rested during her search for Persephone.

In modern culture, Agelasta inspired the title of a documentary by Philippos Koutsaftis (Φίλιππος Κουτσαφτής), called &quot;Agelastos Petra&quot; (&quot;Αγέλαστος Πέτρα&quot;, &quot;smile-less stone&quot;, 2000).

<doc id="78367" wikidata="Q392631" url="?curid=78367" title="Agenor">
<text>Agenor (; ) was in Greek mythology and history a Phoenician king of Tyre or Sidon. The Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484–425 BC), born in the city of Halicarnassus under the Achaemenid Empire, estimated that Agenor lived either 1000 or 1600 years prior to his visit to Tyre in 450 BC at the end of the Greco-Persian Wars (499–449 BC). He was said to have reigned in that city for 63 years.

==Family==
Agenor was born in Memphis, Egypt to Poseidon and Libya and he had a twin brother named Belus. The latter remained in Egypt and reigned over there while Agenor departed to Phoenicia and reigned there. In a rare version of the myth, Agenor and Belus had another brother named Enyalios. According to other sources, he was the son of Belus and brother of Phineus, Phoenix, Aegyptus and Danaus. This tradition was followed by Tzetzes but he added Ninus as one of the six brothers. The same author claimed that there were two Agenors, the first one being the brother of Belus while the second was the son of the latter, thus uncle of the first Agenor.

Sources differed also as to Agenor&#x27;s children; he was said to have been the father of Europa, Cadmus, Cilix, Phoenix, Phineus, Thasus and sometimes, Syros and Cepheus. Agenor&#x27;s wife was variously given as Telephassa, Argiope, Antiope, and Tyro, with the latter giving her name to the city of Tyre. According to Pherecydes of Athens, his first wife was Damno, daughter of Belus, who bore him Phoenix and two daughters, Isaia and Melia, who married Aegyptus and Danaus, respectively; Agenor then fathered Cadmus with Argiope, daughter of the river-god Neilus.

In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, however, Europa was clearly a daughter of Phoenix. Either Cadmus or Europa were confirmed as children of Phoenix by the &quot;Ehoeae&quot; attributed to Hesiod, Bacchylides, Moschus and various scholia. Cilix and Phineus were also sons of Phoenix according to Pherecydes, who also added an otherwise unknown son named Doryclus.

Most later sources listed Cadmus and Cilix as sons of Agenor directly without mentioning Phoenix. On the rare occasions when he was mentioned, Phoenix was listed as the brother of Cadmus and Cilix. Whether he was included as a brother of Agenor or as a son, his role in mythology was limited to inheriting his father&#x27;s kingdom and to becoming the eponym of the Phoenicians. All accounts agreed on a Phoenician king who has several children, including the two sons named Cadmus and Cilix and a daughter named Europa.

A certain Eidothea, wife of Phineus, was called the sister of Cadmus and thus maybe the daughter of Agenor. Taygete, usually one of the Pleiades and mother of Lacedemon by Zeus was also said to be the daughter of Agenor.
==Mythology==

Zeus saw Agenor&#x27;s daughter Europa gathering flowers and immediately fell in love with her. Zeus transformed himself into a white bull and carried Europa away to the island of Crete. He then revealed his true identity and Europa became the first queen of Crete. Agenor, meanwhile, sent Europa&#x27;s brothers, Cadmus and Cilix in search of her, telling them not to return without her. In some versions of the tale, Agenor sends her other brothers as well: Phineus or Thasus (and of course Phoenix in the versions in which Cadmus&#x27;s father is Agenor).

As Europa could not be found, none of the brothers returned. Cadmus consulted the oracle of Delphi and was advised to travel until encountering a cow. He was to follow this cow and to found a city where the cow would lie down; this city became Thebes. Cilix searched for her and settled down in Asia Minor. The land was called Cilicia after him.

According to the chronicler Malalas, when Agenor was about to die, he ordered that all the land he had conquered be divided among his three sons. Phoenix took Tyre and its hinterland, and called the country Phoenicia after himself. Similarly, Syros call the country allotted to him Syria. Likewise, Cilix called the latitudes allotted to him Cilicia.

==Identity and deeds==
Virgil called Carthage the city of Agenor, by which he alluded to the descent of Dido from Agenor. German philologist Philipp Karl Buttmann pointed out that the genuine Phoenician name of Agenor was &quot;Chnas&quot; or &quot;Khna&quot;, which was the same as Canaan, and upon these facts he built the hypothesis that Agenor or Chnas was the same as the Canaan in the books of Moses. Quintus Curtius Rufus considered Agenor to have been the founder of Sidon, and he was also popularly supposed to have introduced the Phoenician alphabet, which was later taught by Cadmus to the Greeks and became the foundation of their own writing system.

<text>Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) is a protocol in the IPX/SPX protocol stack that corresponds to a connection-oriented transport layer protocol in the OSI model. Being reliable and connection-oriented, it is analogous to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) of TCP/IP, but it is a datagram protocol, rather than a stream protocol.

== SPX packet structure==

Each SPX packet begins with a header with the following structure:

The Connection Control fields contains 4 single-bit flags:

The Datastream Type serves to close the SPX connection. For this purpose two values are used:

<doc id="78370" wikidata="Q749123" url="?curid=78370" title="Euphemus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Euphemus (, &quot;Eὔphēmos&quot;, &quot;reputable&quot;) was counted among the Calydonian hunters and the Argonauts, and was connected with the legend of the foundation of Cyrene. 

== Family ==
Euphemus was a son of Poseidon, granted by his father the power to walk on water. His mother is variously named: (1) Europe, daughter of the giant Tityos; (2) Doris (Oris), (3) Mecionice, daughter of either Eurotas or Orion or (4) lastly, Macionassa. In some accounts he is said to have been married to Laonome, sister of Heracles. 

== Mythology ==
Euphemus birthplace is given as &quot;the banks of the Cephissus&quot; by Pindar or Hyria in Boeotia by the &quot;Megalai Ehoiai&quot;, but his later residence was Taenarum in Laconia. Euphemus joined the voyage of the Argonauts, and served the crew as helmsman. He let a dove fly between the Symplegades to see if the ship would be able to pass as well. By a Lemnian woman (Malicha, Malache, or Lamache) he became the father of Leucophanes.

Euphemus was mythologically linked to the Greek colonization of Libya and foundation of Cyrene. In Pindar&#x27;s Pythian Ode 4, the myth of him as the ancestor of the colonizers is recounted in the form of a prophecy by Medea, and runs as follows. When the Argonauts stop by the lake Tritonis in Libya, they encounter Eurypylus, a son of Poseidon, who offers them a clod of earth as a sign of hospitality. Euphemus takes the clod with instructions to throw it on the ground beside the entrance to the Underworld at Taenarum by which his descendants in the fourth generation would then rule over Libya. The clod is accidentally washed overboard and carried to the island Thera, and Libya is colonized from that island by Battus of Thera, an alleged distant descendant of Euphemus (by 17 generations), who founds Cyrene. 

The &quot;Argonautica&quot; by Apollonius Rhodius appears to follow a different version of the same myth: in the poem, when the Argonauts arrive near Lake Tritonis, Euphemus accepts the clod of earth from Triton who first introduces himself as Eurypylus but later reveals his true divine identity. Later, Euphemus has a dream of the clod producing drops of milk and then changing into a woman; in his dream, he has sex with the woman, and at the same time cries over her as if she were nursed by him; she then tells him that she is a daughter of Triton and Libya and the nurse of future children of Euphemus, and instructs him to entrust her to the care of the Nereids, promising that she would return in the future to provide a home for Euphemus&#x27; children. Euphemus consults Jason about this dream and, following his advice, throws the clod in the sea, whereupon it transforms into the island Calliste (Thera). The island is later colonized by the descendants of Euphemus who had previously been expelled from Lemnos and failed to find refuge in Sparta.

Euphemus was portrayed on the chest of Cypselus as the winner of the chariot race at the funeral games of Pelias.

==In popular culture==
In the 1963 motion picture Jason and the Argonauts Euphemus is portrayed by British actor/stuntman Doug Robinson. The film relegates him to being only a minor character recognized as being a champion swimmer. In contrast to his mythology, Euphemus is killed by the film&#x27;s villain Acastus who betrayed the Argonauts.

<text>In Greek mythology, Aglaea () or Aglaia (; ) is a goddess, one of the Charites (known as the Graces in Roman mythology).

== Family ==

According to Hesiod and other sources (including Apollodorus), Aglaea was one of the three Charites, along with Euphrosyne (mirth) and Thalia (abundance), who were the daughters of Zeus and the Oceanid Eurynome. Other sources name the same three Charites (Aglaea, Euphrosyne and Thalia) but give them different parents. The &quot;Orphic Hymn to the Graces&quot; says they are the daughters of Zeus and Eunomia (goddess of good order and lawful conduct), and Pindar says that they are daughters of the strongest god (i.e. Zeus) without naming their mother. Hesiod says also that Aglaea is the youngest of the Charites.

According to the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, Aglaea is one of the &quot;dancers of Orchomenus&quot; (i.e. the Charites, per Pindar), along with Pasithea and Peitho, who attend Aphrodite. When Aphrodite jealously attempts to weave better than Athena, the Charites help her do so, with Aglaea passing her the yarn. Aglaea also acts as Aphrodite&#x27;s messenger, and is sent to find and bring a message to Eros, who travels back to Aphrodite much faster because he can fly whereas Aglaea cannot. Aglaea here is referred to as a &quot;Charis&quot; (singular of Charites), but other characters not of this group are also named Charis, including by Aglaea.

Hesiod says that Aglaea was married to Hephaestus. (This is often seen as after his divorce from Aphrodite.) The Orphic Fragments compiled by Otto Kern say that by Hephaestus, Aglaea became mother of Eucleia (&quot;Good Repute&quot;), Eupheme (&quot;Acclaim&quot;), Euthenia (&quot;Prosperity&quot;), and Philophrosyne (&quot;Welcome&quot;). The &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; refer to the wife of Hephaestus as Charis, and some scholars conclude that these references refer to Aglaea.

<doc id="78374" wikidata="Q335295" url="?curid=78374" title="Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby">
<text>Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, (1435 – 29 July 1504) was an English nobleman. He was the stepfather of King Henry VII of England. He was the eldest son of Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley and Joan Goushill.

A landed magnate of immense wealth and power, particularly across the northwest of England where his authority went almost unchallenged, Stanley managed to remain in favour with successive kings throughout the Wars of the Roses, including King Richard III of England, who took Stanley&#x27;s son as a hostage. Thomas Stanley took the side of Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. His estates included what is now Tatton Park in Cheshire, Lathom House in Lancashire, and Derby House in the City of London, now the site of the College of Arms.

Although the king for the early part of his career, Henry VI, was head of the House of Lancaster, Stanley&#x27;s marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury (a descendant of Edward III) and sister of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick (&#x27;Warwick the Kingmaker&#x27;) in the late 1450s constituted a powerful alliance with the House of York. This did him no harm, however, even after Warwick was toppled from power, and in 1472, with the House of York again occupying the English throne, he married his second wife Lady Margaret Beaufort, whose son, Henry Tudor, was the leading Lancastrian claimant. He was the last to use the style &#x27;King of Mann&#x27;, his successors opting for the safer &#x27;Lord of Mann&#x27;. Among his notable close relatives were his brother Sir William Stanley and his nephews Sir John Savage and Thomas Savage, Archbishop of York.

==Inheritance==

After the death of his father in 1459, Stanley inherited his father&#x27;s titles, including those of Baron Stanley and King of Mann as well as his extensive lands and offices in Cheshire and Lancashire. It was a formidable inheritance and gave him ample opportunity to gain experience in the leadership of men. At the same time, his father&#x27;s prominence in the king&#x27;s household had provided him with an early introduction to court where he was named among the squires of Henry VI in 1454. Nevertheless, in the febrile and bloodthirsty circumstances of the Wars of the Roses it was a position fraught with danger as rival claimants for the throne – successively the Houses of Lancaster and York – demanded, threatened or begged for the support of Stanley and his followers.

==Lancaster vs York==

The Stanleys had been among the earliest supporters of Henry Bolingbroke&#x27;s bid to win the English throne for the House of Lancaster in 1399 and Stanley&#x27;s great-grandfather Sir John Stanley, had been richly rewarded for his assistance. After some years of weak and ineffectual government led by the Lancastrian Henry VI, a challenge from the House of York broke out into open warfare in the 1450s in the War of the Roses. 

In 1459, an accord between the Lancastrian and the Yorkist lords broke down, and the conflict lapped at the borders of the Stanleys&#x27; sphere of influence. With the Earl of Salisbury (Stanley&#x27;s father-in-law) mobilising on behalf of the House of York, Queen Margaret of Anjou at Lichfield ordered Stanley to raise forces to intercept him. However, when the two armies met at the Battle of Blore Heath in 1459, though only a few miles away, Stanley kept his 2,000 men out of the fight. His brother, Sir William Stanley, who was certainly in the Yorkist army was subsequently attainted.

Yet by 1460, Lord Stanley had begun to cooperate with the Yorkist lords who by this time had possession of the King and ruled in his name, and he rapidly consolidated his association with the new regime. In the early 1460s, he joined his brother-in-law, Warwick, in the campaigns against the Lancastrian forces and Stanley was confirmed in his fees and offices as the new King, Edward IV, needed him to secure the north-west. 

In the late 1460s, however, the coalition that had brought the Yorkist Edward to the throne was fracturing and Stanley found his loyalties divided once again. &quot;The dramatic shifts in political fortune between 1469 and 1471, and their impact on the tangled networks of affinity and allegiance, are hard to unravel&quot;. 

When Warwick, fleeing before Edward in 1470, made his way to Manchester in the hope of support, Stanley was not forthcoming, but on Warwick&#x27;s return, he lent him armed support in the restoration of the House of Lancaster and of Henry VI. Lord Stanley was soon forgiven for his disloyalty. After the restoration of Edward IV in 1471, he was appointed steward of the king&#x27;s household and thereafter became a regular member of the royal council. Yet, the death of his first wife, Eleanor Neville at this period severed his connection with Warwick and the Nevilles and allowed in 1472 a marriage of still greater political significance. His new wife, Lady Margaret Beaufort, dowager Countess of Richmond, was the mother of Henry Tudor – potential heir of the House of Lancaster. 

Militarily during this period, and now a stalwart of the Yorkist regime, Stanley led several hundred men in the expedition to France in 1475 and in 1482 served with a large company in the campaign of the Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III) in Scotland, playing a key role in the capture of Berwick upon Tweed.

After the unexpected death of Edward IV in 1483 and the accession of his twelve-year-old son Edward V, Stanley was among those who sought to maintain a balance of power between the young king&#x27;s uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who was now Lord Protector, and his maternal family, the Woodvilles. (Stanley&#x27;s own son and heir, George Stanley, Lord Strange was married to Joan Le Strange whose mother was Jacquetta Woodville, sister of Elizabeth Woodville, and made his wife a cousin of the new King, Edward V). When Gloucester attacked this group at a council meeting in June 1483, Stanley was wounded and imprisoned but at least spared the fate of Lord Hastings – that of summary execution. That month, Parliament declared Edward V and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York (the Princes in the Tower) illegitimate on the grounds that their father Edward IV&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was bigamous, by way of a prior pre-contract of marriage with Eleanor Butler. The Duke of Gloucester was therefore declared king Richard III by public acclamation, later confirmed by Parliament under the Act Titulus Regius.

Apparently &quot;in preparing the ground for the usurpation and in consolidating his position, Richard found it more expedient to appease than to alienate the house of Stanley&quot;. Thus, Lord Stanley was soon at liberty and continued as steward of the royal household, apparently flourishing at the heart of the new regime. He bore the great mace at Richard&#x27;s coronation, while his wife carried the new queen&#x27;s train. Richard stripped Stanley&#x27;s wife, Margaret Beaufort, of all her titles and possession for her part &quot;in compassyng and doyng Treason&quot;, but transferred all her properties to Stanley, effectively negating much of the punishment.

He was also appointed to the Order of the Garter, taking the stall vacated by the executed Lord Hastings. This commitment bore further fruit in the autumn of 1483, when a series of plots against the King coalesced into Buckingham&#x27;s rebellion, a rising in southern and western England under the loose leadership of the Duke of Buckingham. When Richard rose to suppress the rebellion, Stanley and his brother William were at the King&#x27;s side and were richly rewarded from the forfeited estates of the rebels and Stanley was appointed to Buckingham&#x27;s position as Lord High Constable of England. Whilst Stanley might have had no other option than to act as Richard&#x27;s loyal subject, it is conceivable that he may himself have become involved in the uprising. His wife, Margaret Beaufort, was a key conspirator, having brokered the marriage alliance between Edward IV&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth of York and her son Henry Tudor. 

Indeed, it was only by giving a solemn undertaking to Richard to keep his wife in custody and to end her intrigues that Stanley saved her from attainder and disgrace and presumably his own position at the same time. Richard was evidently well aware of the threat from this quarter since in the summer of 1485, when Stanley sought permission to leave the court and return to his northern fastness of Lathom, the king insisted that his son, George Stanley, Lord Strange, take his place at court as a token for his father&#x27;s good behaviour.

==The Battle of Bosworth==
The Stanleys had been communicating with the exiled Henry Tudor for some time and Tudor&#x27;s strategy of landing in Wales and heading east into central England depended on the acquiescence of Sir William Stanley, as Chamberlain of Chester and north Wales, and by extension on that of Lord Stanley himself. On hearing of the invasion, Richard ordered the two Stanleys to raise the men of the region in readiness to oppose the invader. However, once it was clear that Tudor was marching unopposed through Wales, Richard ordered Lord Stanley to join him without delay. According to the Croyland Chronicle, although Lord Stanley excused himself on the grounds of illness, the &#x27;sweating sickness&#x27;, by now Richard had firm evidence of the Stanleys&#x27; complicity. After an unsuccessful bid to escape from court, Lord Strange confessed that he and his uncle, Sir William Stanley, had conspired with Henry Tudor. Richard proclaimed him a traitor, and let it be known that Strange&#x27;s life was a hostage for his father&#x27;s loyalty in the coming conflict. Indeed, Richard allegedly issued orders for Strange&#x27;s execution on the battlefield, although in the event these were never carried out. Lord Stanley&#x27;s response to Richard&#x27;s threat was reportedly laconic: &quot;Sire, I have other sons&quot;.

Three armies followed each other into the midlands: Lord Stanley and his forces; then Sir William Stanley; and finally Henry Tudor and a host comprising Tudor retainers, dispossessed Lancastrian exiles and many men of Wales and Cheshire. Lord Stanley may have secretly met with Henry on the eve of the battle, but when the Stanleyites arrived south of the village of Market Bosworth on 22 August they took up a position independent of both the royal forces and the rebel army. In effect, the two brothers played similar roles to those they had played at the Battle of Blore Heath over a quarter of a century earlier. Lord Stanley took no direct part in the action but stood unmoving between the two armies and it was Sir William&#x27;s decisive intervention that gave Henry the victory. After the despatch of Richard, who had gone into battle crowned, Polydore Vergil records that the fallen coronet was retrieved and placed by Lord Stanley on his stepson&#x27;s head before his cheering troops, thereby emphasising the critical role the Stanleys had played in bringing Henry Tudor to the throne.

==Further prizes==

Henry demonstrated his gratitude to his &quot;right dearly beloved father&quot; by creating him Earl of Derby on 27 October 1485, and the following year confirmed him in office as Lord High Constable of England and High Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster, besides granting him other estates and offices. In 1486 Stanley also stood as godfather to Henry&#x27;s eldest son, Arthur, Prince of Wales.
Even so, at the time of the Lambert Simnel rising of 1487, there may have been some concern that the Stanleys were again hedging their bets, and &quot;there was relief in the royal host when the Stanleyites came in at Nottingham&quot;. 

The aftermath of the Battle of Stoke, which crushed this rising, brought still further rewards for Stanley – notably the lands forfeited by Viscount Lovell, Sir Thomas Pilkington, and Sir Thomas Broughton in Lancashire and elsewhere. In 1489, the Stanleys again made a notable contribution to the army raised by Henry to suppress a rising in Yorkshire. Less successfully, Stanley&#x27;s brother William unwisely supported the later pretender Perkin Warbeck, and was, at last, executed for treason in 1495.

==Dominance of North-West England==

Throughout his career, alongside the main performance of national events, the preservation and enhancement of Stanley&#x27;s own role as regional magnate was a very important sideshow. Change of regime never really weakened his grip on the key offices of Chester and Lancaster and throughout his life, Stanley consolidated the legacy he had inherited from his father and extended his hegemony and that of his family across the north-west. Given the range of his office-holding both regionally and at court, he did not need to draw ruinously on his own resources to dispense patronage on a grand scale and he was active in the arbitration of local disputes; even state matters were regularly referred for his personal adjudication. That said, &#x27;good lordship&#x27; also had its harder face and the Stanleys brooked no opposition and tolerated few rivals in their areas of dominance.

==Death==

Stanley died at Lathom, Lancashire on 29 July 1504, and was buried in the family chapel in Burscough Priory, near Ormskirk in Lancashire, surrounded by the tombs of his parents and others of his ancestors. He had been predeceased by his eldest son and heir, George Stanley, Lord Strange by a matter of months and was succeeded as Earl by his grandson, Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby. &quot;In his will of 28 July 1504 he ordained masses for the souls of himself, his wives, parents, ancestors, children, siblings, and, ever the good lord, &#x27;them that have died in the service of my lord my father or of me&#x27;”.

==Marriages and children==
He married twice:
Firstly, in the chapel of Middleham Castle, Yorkshire, by royal licence dated 1451, to Eleanor Neville (d.1472), a daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, by his wife Alice Montagu, daughter and heiress of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury. Eleanor died in 1472 and was buried in the Church of St James Garlickhythe in the City of London. By Eleanor he had eleven children, of whom three attained positions of great status:
*John Stanley, eldest son and heir apparent, died young.
*George Stanley, 9th Baron Strange (1460–1503), KG,&quot; jure uxoris&quot; 9th Baron Strange, 2nd surviving son and heir apparent, who predeceased his father by one year, leaving a son Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby.
*Richard Stanley, 3rd son, died young.
*Edward Stanley, 1st Baron Monteagle (1462–1524), KG.
*James Stanley (1465–1515), Bishop of Ely.
*Thomas Stanley, died in 1475.
*William Stanley, died young.
*Anne Stanley, died young.
*Alice Stanley, died young.
*Katherine Stanley, died young.
*Agnes Stanley, died young.
Secondly, shortly before 12 June 1472 he married Lady Margaret Beaufort, (1441/3-1509), daughter of John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset (c.1403-1444), KG, a legitimised descendant of John of Gaunt (1340–1399) (third surviving son of King Edward III) by his mistress Katherine Swynford. Lady Margaret Beaufort was the widow successively of Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond (d.1456), by whom she was the mother of Henry Tudor, who in 1485 became King Henry VII (1485–1509); and secondly of Sir Henry Stafford (d.1471). Without issue.

==Illegitimate children==
He is also said to have had an illegitimate son, John, who in 1476 became Keeper of Shotwick Park in Cheshire, but was unrecognised in official pedigrees. He seems to have died in 1477.

==Legacy==

At his death, Lord Stanley could look back on a career of forty-five years of remarkable political success amid the most challenging of circumstances. He had not only escaped the bloody fate of so many of his political contemporaries, including his brother, but on top of the great patrimony he inherited from his father, he acquired huge estates and national offices, the Garter and an earldom. These, and his closeness to successive royal families – whom he could count amongst his kith and kin by several different connections – made him a figure of great power and influence. Under his adroit leadership, the north-west escaped the worst horrors of decades of civil war that devastated other parts of England and his family &quot;helped bring a degree of cultivation and refinement to the north-west&quot;. Their patronage underpinned the careers of a number of young Lancashire men, including William Smyth, Hugh Oldham, and Christopher Urswick, who went on to become pillars of the Tudor church and state.

The senior line of the descendants of Thomas Stanley and Eleanor Neville continued to hold the Earldom of Derby until the death of James Stanley, 10th Earl of Derby in 1736. The title then passed to a junior branch of the family, the Baronets Stanley of Bickerstaffe, descended from Sir James Stanley, younger brother of Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby. This branch still holds the title today. Edward Stanley, born in 1962, became 19th Earl of Derby in 1994. (John Stanley a younger brother of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby was the ancestor of the Barons Stanley of Alderley.)

==References in Shakespeare==

In the history plays of William Shakespeare, Lord Stanley features in a pivotal role throughout the play &quot;Richard III&quot; as an initially loyal but troubled courtier and royal official whose misgivings as to Richard&#x27;s true nature lead him towards plotting regime change in favor of his stepson Henry Tudor, even to the point of defecting to the Tudor Army during the Battle of Bosworth Field and knowingly putting the life of his legitimate heir, whom Richard is holding as a hostage, and who is in danger of being murdered. &quot;Richard III&quot; is believed to have been written during 1592–93. At this time, it is thought Shakespeare may already have been writing for Lord Strange&#x27;s Men, the company of Ferdinando Stanley, Lord Strange, later the 5th Earl of Derby. (It is certain that his actors were members of the company, and Shakespeare himself was formally listed as a member by 1594). As such, the Stanleys would effectively have been patrons of this work. This was a relationship that may have been continued, as &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; is thought to have been possibly first performed at the wedding celebrations of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby in 1595.

<doc id="78375" wikidata="Q273003" url="?curid=78375" title="Simonides of Ceos">
<text>Simonides of Ceos (; ; c. 556 – 468 BC) was a Greek lyric poet, born in Ioulis on Ceos. The scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria included him in the canonical list of the nine lyric poets esteemed by them as worthy of critical study. Included on this list were Bacchylides, his nephew, and Pindar, reputedly a bitter rival, both of whom benefited from his innovative approach to lyric poetry. Simonides, however, was more involved than either in the major events and with the personalities of their times. 

Lessing, writing in the Enlightenment era, referred to him as &quot;the Greek Voltaire.&quot; His general renown owes much to traditional accounts of his colourful life, as one of the wisest of men; as a greedy miser; as an inventor of a system of mnemonics; and the inventor of some letters of the Greek alphabet (). Such accounts include fanciful elements, yet he had a real influence on the sophistic enlightenment of the Classical era. His fame as a poet rests largely on his ability to present basic human situations with affecting simplicity. In the words of the Roman rhetorician Quintilian (35–100 AD):

He is popularly associated with epitaphs commemorating fallen warriors, as for example the Lacedaemonians at the Battle of Thermopylae:
Today only glimpses of his poetry remain, either in the form of papyrus fragments or quotations by ancient literary figures, yet new fragments continue to be unearthed by archaeologists at Oxyrhynchus, a city and archaeological site in Egypt that has yielded papyrus fragments from over a century of excavations. He is included in narratives as diverse as Mary Renault&#x27;s modern historical novel &quot;The Praise Singer&quot; (where he is the narrator and main character), Plato&#x27;s &quot;Protagoras&quot; (where he is a topic of conversation), and some verses in Callimachus&#x27; &quot;Aetia&quot; (where he is portrayed as a ghost complaining about the desecration of his own tomb in Acragas).

== Biography ==
Few clear facts about Simonides&#x27; life have come down to modern times in spite of his fame and influence. Ancient sources are uncertain even about the date of his birth. According to the Byzantine encyclopaedia, Suda: &quot;He was born in the 56th Olympiad (556/552 BC) or according to some writers in the 62nd (532/528 BC) and he survived until the 78th (468/464 BC), having lived eighty-nine years.&quot; Simonides was popularly accredited with the invention of four letters of the revised alphabet and, as the author of inscriptions, he was the first major poet who composed verses to be read rather than recited. Coincidentally he also composed a dithyramb on the subject of Perseus that is now one of the largest fragments of his extant verses.

Modern scholars generally accept 556–468 BC as the span of his life in spite of some awkward consequences—for example it would make him about fifty years older than his nephew Bacchylides and still very active internationally at about 80 years of age. Other ancient sources also have awkward consequences. For example, according to an entry in the Parian Marble, Simonides died in 468/467 BC at the age of ninety yet, in another entry, it lists a victory by his grandfather in a poetry competition in Athens in 489/488 BC — this grandfather must have been over a hundred years old at that time if the birth dates for Simonides are correct. The grandfather&#x27;s name, as recorded by the Parian Marble, was also Simonides, and it has been argued by some scholars that the earliest references to Simonides in ancient sources might in fact be references to this grandfather. However, the Parian Marble is known to be unreliable and possibly it was not even the grandfather but a grandson that won the aforementioned victory in Athens. According to the Suda, this grandson was yet another Simonides and he was the author of books on genealogy.

===Early years: Ceos and Athens===

Simonides was the son of Leoprepes, and the grandson or descendant of Hylichus. He was born in Ioulis on Ceos (Ἰουλίς, Κέως), the outermost island of the Cyclades. The innermost island, Delos, was the reputed birthplace of Apollo, where the people of Ceos regularly sent choirs to perform hymns in the god&#x27;s honour. Carthaea, another Cean town, included a choregeion or school where choirs were trained, and possibly Simonides worked there as a teacher in his early years.

In addition to its musical culture, Ceos had a rich tradition of athletic competition, especially in running and boxing (the names of Ceans victorious at Panhellenic competitions were recorded at Ioulis on slabs of stone) making it fertile territory for a genre of choral lyric that Simonides pioneered—the victory ode. Indeed, the grandfather of Simonides&#x27; nephew, Bacchylides, was one of the island&#x27;s notable athletes.

Ceos lies only some fifteen miles south-east of Attica, whither Simonides was drawn, about the age of thirty, by the lure of opportunities opening up at the court of the tyrant Hipparchus, a patron of the arts. His rivalry there with another chorus-trainer and poet, Lasus of Hermione, became something of a joke to Athenians of a later generation—it is mentioned briefly by the comic playwright Aristophanes who earmarked Simonides as a miserly type of professional poet (see The Miser below)

===Middle career: Thessaly===
After the assassination of Hipparchus (514 BC), Simonides withdrew to Thessaly, where he enjoyed the protection and patronage of the Scopadae and Aleuadae. These were two of the most powerful families in the Thessalian feudal aristocracy yet they seemed notable to later Greeks such as Theocritus only for their association with Simonides. Thessaly at that time was a cultural backwater, remaining in the &#x27;Dark Ages&#x27; until the close of the 5th century. According to an account by Plutarch, the Ionian poet once dismissed the Thessalians as &quot;too ignorant&quot; to be beguiled by poetry.

Among the most colourful of his &quot;ignorant&quot; patrons was the head of the Scopadae clan, named Scopas. Fond of drinking, convivial company and vain displays of wealth, this aristocrat&#x27;s proud and capricious dealings with Simonides are demonstrated in a traditional account related by Cicero and Quintilian, according to which the poet was commissioned to write a victory ode for a boxer. Simonides embellished his ode with so many references to the twins Castor and Pollux (heroic archetypes of the boxer) that Scopas told him to collect half the commissioned fee from them — he would only pay the other half. Simonides however ended up getting much more from the mythical twins than just a fee; he owed them his very life (see Miraculous escapes). According to this story he was called out of the feast hall to see two visitors who had arrived and were asking for him – presumably Castor and Pollux. As soon as he left the hall, it collapsed, killing everyone within. These events were said to have inspired him to develop a system of mnemonics based on images and places called the method of loci. The method of loci is one component of the art of memory.

===Career highlight: Persian Wars===
The Thessalian period in Simonides&#x27; career is followed in most biographies by his return to Athens during the Persian Wars and it is certain that he became a prominent international figure at that time, particularly as the author of commemorative verses. According to an anonymous biographer of Aeschylus, the Athenians chose Simonides ahead of Aeschylus to be the author of an epigram honouring their war-dead at Marathon, which led the tragedian (who had fought at the battle and whose brother had died there) to withdraw sulking to the court of Hieron of Syracuse — the story is probably based on the inventions of comic dramatists but it is likely that Simonides did in fact write some kind of commemorative verses for the Athenian victory at Marathon.

His ability to compose tastefully and poignantly on military themes put him in great demand among Greek states after their defeat of the second Persian invasion, when he is known to have composed epitaphs for Athenians, Spartans and Corinthians, a commemorative song for Leonidas and his men, a dedicatory epigram for Pausanias, and poems on the battles of Artemisium, Salamis, and Plataea.

According to Plutarch, the Cean had a statue of himself made about this time, which inspired the Athenian politician Themistocles to comment on his ugliness. In the same account, Themistocles is said to have rejected an attempt by the poet to bribe him, then likened himself as an honest magistrate to a good poet, since an honest magistrate keeps the laws and a good poet keeps in tune. Suda mentions a feud between Simonides and the Rhodian lyric poet, Timocreon, for whom Simonides apparently composed a mock epitaph that touches on the issue of the Rhodian&#x27;s medism—an issue that also involved Themistocles.

===Final years: Sicily===
The last years of the poet&#x27;s life were spent in Sicily, where he became a friend and confidant of Hieron of Syracuse. According to a scholiast on Pindar, he once acted as peace-maker between Hieron and another Sicilian tyrant, Theron of Acragas, thus ending a war between them. Scholiasts are the only authority for stories about the rivalry between Simonides and Pindar at the court of Hieron, traditionally used to explain some of the meanings in Pindar&#x27;s victory odes (see the articles on Bacchylides and Pindar). If the stories of rivalry are true, it may be surmised that Simonides&#x27;s experiences at the courts of the tyrants, Hipparchus and Scopas, gave him a competitive edge over the proud Pindar and enabled him to promote the career of his nephew, Bacchylides, at Pindar&#x27;s expense. However, Pindar scholiasts are generally considered unreliable, and there is no reason to accept their account. The Hellenistic poet Callimachus revealed in one of his poems that Simonides was buried outside Acragas, and that his tombstone was later misused in the construction of a tower.

===Biographical themes===
Traditional accounts of the poet&#x27;s life embody a variety of themes.

====Miraculous escapes====
As mentioned above, both Cicero and Quintilian are sources for the story that Scopas, the Thassalian nobleman, refused to pay Simonides in full for a victory ode that featured too many decorative references to the mythical twins, Castor and Pollux. According to the rest of the story, Simonides was celebrating the same victory with Scopas and his relatives at a banquet when he received word that two young men were waiting outside to see him. When he got outside, however, he discovered firstly that the two young men were nowhere to be found and, secondly, that the dining hall was collapsing behind him. Scopas and a number of his relatives were killed. Apparently the two young men were the twins and they had rewarded the poet&#x27;s interest in them by thus saving his life. Simonides later benefited from the tragedy by deriving a system of mnemonics from it (see The inventor). Quintilian dismisses the story as a fiction because &quot;the poet nowhere mentions the affair, although he was not in the least likely to keep silent on a matter which brought him such glory ...&quot; This however was not the only miraculous escape that his piety afforded him.

There are two epigrams in the Palatine Anthology, both attributed to Simonides and both dedicated to a drowned man whose corpse the poet and some companions are said to have found and buried on an island. The first is an epitaph in which the dead man is imagined to invoke blessings on those who had buried the body, and the second records the poet&#x27;s gratitude to the drowned man for having saved his own life – Simonides had been warned by his ghost not to set sail from the island with his companions, who all subsequently drowned.

====The inventor====
During the excavation of the rubble of Scopas&#x27;s dining hall, Simonides was called upon to identify each guest killed. Their bodies had been crushed beyond recognition but he completed the gruesome task by correlating their identities to their positions (&quot;loci&quot; in Latin) at the table before his departure. He later drew on this experience to develop the &#x27;memory theatre&#x27; or &#x27;memory palace&#x27;, a system for mnemonics widely used in oral societies until the Renaissance. According to Cicero, Themistocles wasn&#x27;t much impressed with the poet&#x27;s invention: &quot;I would rather a technique of forgetting, for I remember what I would rather not remember and cannot forget what I would rather forget.&quot; 

The Suda credits Simonides with inventing &quot;the third note of the lyre&quot; (which is known to be wrong since the lyre had seven strings from the 7th century BC), and four letters of the Greek alphabet. Whatever the validity of such claims, a creative and original turn of mind is demonstrated in his poetry as he likely invented the genre of the victory ode and he gave persuasive expression to a new set of ethical standards (see Ethics).

====The miser====
In his play &quot;Peace&quot;, Aristophanes imagined that the tragic poet Sophocles had turned into Simonides: &quot;He may be old and decayed, but these days, if you paid him enough, he&#x27;d go to sea in a sieve.&quot; A scholiast, commenting on the passage, wrote: &quot;Simonides seems to have been the first to introduce money-grabbing into his songs and to write a song for pay&quot; and, as proof of it, quoted a passage from one of Pindar&#x27;s odes (&quot;For then the Muse was not yet fond of profit nor mercenary&quot;), which he interpreted as covert criticism of Simonides. The same scholiast related a popular story that the poet kept two boxes, one empty and the other full – the empty one being where he kept favours, the full one being where he kept his money. According to Athenaeus, when Simonides was at Hieron&#x27;s court in Syracuse, he used to sell most of the daily provisions that he received from the tyrant, justifying himself thus: &quot;So that all may see Hieron&#x27;s magnificence and my moderation.&quot; Aristotle reported that the wife of Hieron once asked Simonides whether it was better to be wealthy or wise, to which he apparently replied: &quot;Wealthy; for I see the wise spending their days at the doors of the wealthy.&quot;

According to an anecdote recorded on a papyrus, dating to around 250 BC, Hieron once asked the poet if everything grows old: &quot;Yes,&quot; Simonides answered, &quot;all except money-making; and kind deeds age most quickly of all.&quot; He once rejected a small fee to compose a victory ode for the winner of a mule race (it was not a prestigious event) but, according to Aristotle, changed his mind when the fee was increased, resulting in this magniloquent opening: &quot;Greetings, daughters of storm-footed steeds!&quot; In a quote recorded by Plutarch, he once complained that old age had robbed him of every pleasure but making money.

All these amusing anecdotes might simply reflect the fact that he was the first poet to charge fees for his services – generosity is glimpsed in his payment for an inscription on a friend&#x27;s epitaph, as recorded by Herodotus. Herodotus also mentions an earlier poet Arion, who had amassed a fortune on a visit to Italy and Sicily, so maybe Simonides was not the first professional poet, as claimed by the Greeks themselves.

====The sage and wit====

Plato, in &quot;The Republic&quot;, numbered Simonides with Bias and Pittacus among the wise and blessed, even putting into the mouth of Socrates the words &quot;it is not easy to disbelieve Simonides, for he is a wise man and divinely inspired,&quot; but in his dialogue &quot;Protagoras&quot;, Plato numbered Simonides with Homer and Hesiod as precursors of the sophist. A number of apocryphal sayings were attributed to him.

Michael Psellos accredited him with &quot;the word is the image of the thing.&quot; Plutarch commended &quot;the saying of Simonides, that he had often felt sorry after speaking but never after keeping silent&quot; and observed that &quot;Simonides calls painting silent poetry and poetry painting that speaks&quot; (later paraphrased by the Latin poet Horace as ut pictura poesis).

Diogenes Laërtius, after quoting a famous epigram by Cleobulus (one of ancient Greece&#x27;s &#x27;seven sages&#x27;) in which a maiden sculptured on a tomb is imagined to proclaim her eternal vigilance, quotes Simonides commenting on it in a poem of his own: &quot;Stone is broken even by mortal hands. That was the judgement of a fool.&quot; His rationalist view of the cosmos is evinced also in Plutarch&#x27;s letter of consolation to Apollonius: &quot;according to Simonides a thousand or ten thousand years are an indeterminable point, or rather the tiniest part of a point.&quot;

Cicero related how, when Hieron of Syracuse asked him to define god, Simonides continually postponed his reply, &quot;because the longer I deliberate, the more obscure the matter seems to me.&quot; Stobaeus recorded this reply to a man who had confided in Simonides some unflattering things he had heard said about him: &quot;Please stop slandering me with your ears!&quot;.

== Poetry ==
Simonides composed verses almost entirely for public performances and inscriptions, unlike previous lyric poets such as Sappho and Alcaeus, who composed more intimate verses to entertain friends—&quot;With Simonides the age of individualism in lyric poetry has passed.&quot; Or so it seemed to modern scholars until the recent discovery of papyrus &quot;P.Oxy.&quot; 3965 in which Simonides is glimpsed in a sympotic context, speaking for example as an old man rejuvenated in the company of his homo-erotic lover, couched on a bed of flowers. Some of the short passages identified by ancient or modern authors as epigrams may also have been performed at symposia. Very little of his poetry survives today but enough is recorded on papyrus fragments and in quotes by ancient commentators for many conclusions to be drawn at least &quot;tentatively&quot; (nobody knows if and when the sands of Egypt will reveal further discoveries).

Simonides wrote a wide range of choral lyrics with an Ionian flavour and elegiac verses in Doric idioms. He is generally credited with inventing a new type of choral lyric, the encomium, in particular popularising a form of it, the victory ode. These were extensions of the hymn, which previous generations of poets had dedicated only to gods and heroes:

In one victory ode, celebrating Glaucus of Carystus, a famous boxer, Simonides declares that not even Heracles or Polydeuces could have stood against him—a statement whose impiety seemed notable even to Lucian many generations later.

Simonides was the first to establish the choral dirge as a recognized form of lyric poetry, his aptitude for it being testified, for example, by Quintillian (see quote in the Introduction), Horace (&quot;&quot;Ceae ... munera neniae&quot;), Catullus (&quot;maestius lacrimis Simonideis&quot;&quot;) and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, where he says:
Simonides was adept too at lively compositions suited to dancing (hyporchema), for which he is commended by Plutarch. He was highly successful in dithyrambic competitions according to an anonymous epigram dating from the Hellenistic period, which credited him with 57 victories, possibly in Athens. The dithyramb, a genre of lyrics traditionally sung to Dionysus, was later developed into narratives illustrating heroic myths; Simonides is the earliest poet known to have composed in this enlarged form (the geographer Strabo mentioned a dithyramb, &quot;Memnon&quot;, in which Simonides located the hero&#x27;s tomb in Syria, indicating that he didn&#x27;t compose only on legends of Dionysus.)

Simonides has long been known to have written epitaphs for those who died in the Persian Wars and this has resulted in many pithy verses being mis-attributed to him &quot;... as wise saws to Confucius or musical anecdotes to Beecham.&quot; Modern scholars generally consider only one of the attributed epigrams to be unquestionably authentic (an inscription for the seer Megistius quoted by Herodotus), which places in doubt even some of the most famous examples, such as the one to the Spartans at Thermopylae, quoted in the introduction. He composed longer pieces on a Persian War theme, including &quot;Dirge for the Fallen at Thermopylae&quot;, &quot;Battle at Artemisium&quot; and &quot;Battle at Salamis&quot; but their genres are not clear from the fragmentary remains – the first was labelled by Diodorus Siculus as an &quot;encomium&quot; but it was probably a hymn and the second was characterised in the Suda as elegiac yet Priscian, in a comment on prosody, indicated that it was composed in lyric meter. Substantial fragments of a recently discovered poem, describing the run-up to the Battle of Plataea and comparing Pausanias to Achilles, show that he actually did compose narrative accounts in elegiac meter. Simonides also wrote &quot;Paeans&quot; and &quot;Prayers/Curses&quot; () and possibly in some genres where no record of his work survives.

===Poetic style===
Like other lyric poets in late Archaic Greece, Simonides made notable use of compound adjectives and decorative epithets yet he is also remarkable for his restraint and balance. His expression was clear and simple, relying on straightforward statement. An example is found in a quote by Stobaeus paraphrased here to suggest the original Aeolic verse rhythms, predominantly choriambic ( ¯˘˘¯, ¯˘˘¯ ), with some dactylic expansion (¯˘˘¯˘˘¯) and an iambic close (˘¯,˘¯): 

The only decorative word is &#x27;long-winged&#x27; (), used to denote a dragonfly, and it emerges from the generalised meanings of the passage as an &#x27;objective correlative&#x27; for the fragility of the human condition. The rhythm evokes the movement of the dragonfly and the mutability of human fortunes.

== Ethics ==
Simonides championed a tolerant, humanistic outlook that celebrated ordinary goodness, and recognized the immense pressures that life places on human beings. This attitude is evident in the following poem of Simonides (fr. 542), quoted in Plato&#x27;s dialogue, the Protagoras, and reconstructed here according to a recent interpretation, making it the only lyric poem of Simonides that survives intact:

<text>Alcman (; &quot;Alkmán&quot;; fl. 7th century BC) was an Ancient Greek choral lyric poet from Sparta. He is the earliest representative of the Alexandrian canon of the Nine Lyric Poets. He wrote six books of choral poetry, most of which is now lost; his poetry survives in quotation from other ancient authors and on fragmentary papyri discovered in Egypt. His poetry was composed in the local Doric dialect with Homeric influences. Based on his surviving fragments, his poetry was mostly hymns, and seems to have been composed in long stanzas made up of lines in several different meters.

== Biography ==
Alcman&#x27;s dates are uncertain, but he was probably active in the late seventh century BC. The name of his mother is not known; his father may have been called either Damas or Titarus. Alcman&#x27;s nationality was disputed even in antiquity. The records of the ancient authors were often deduced from biographic readings of their poetry, and the details are often untrustworthy. Antipater of Thessalonica wrote that poets have &quot;many mothers&quot; and that the continents of Europe and Asia both claimed Alcman as their son. Frequently assumed to have been born in Sardis, capital of ancient Lydia, the Suda claims that Alcman was actually a Laconian from Messoa.

The compositeness of his dialect may have helped to maintain the uncertainty of his origins, but the many references to Lydian and Asian culture in Alcman&#x27;s poetry must have played a considerable role in the tradition of Alcman&#x27;s Lydian origin. Thus Alcman claims he learned his skills from the &quot;strident partridges&quot; (&quot;caccabides&quot;), a bird native to Asia Minor and not naturally found in Greece. The ancient scholars seem to refer to one particular song, in which the chorus says: &quot;He was no rustic man, nor clumsy (not even in the view of unskilled men?) nor Thessalian by race nor an Erysichaean shepherd: he was from lofty Sardis.&quot; Yet, given that there was a discussion, it cannot have been certain who was the third person of this fragment.

Some modern scholars defend his Lydian origin on the basis of the language of some fragments or the content. However, Sardis of the 7th century BC was a cosmopolitan city. The implicit and explicit references to Lydian culture may be a means of describing the girls of the choruses as fashionable.

One tradition, going back to Aristotle, holds that Alcman came to Sparta as a slave to the family of Agesidas (= Hagesidamus?), by whom he was eventually emancipated because of his great skill. Aristotle reported that it was believed Alcman died from a pustulant infestation of lice (&quot;phthiriasis&quot;), but he may have been mistaken for the philosopher Alcmaeon of Croton. According to Pausanias, he is buried in Sparta next to the shrine of Helen of Troy.

There were six books of Alcman&#x27;s choral poetry in antiquity (c. 50–60 hymns), but they were lost at the threshold of the Middle Ages, and Alcman was known only through fragmentary quotations in other Greek authors until the discovery of a papyrus in 1855(?) in a tomb near the second pyramid at Saqqâra in Egypt. The fragment, which is now kept at the Louvre in Paris, contains approximately 100 verses of a so-called &quot;partheneion&quot;, i.e. a song performed by a chorus of young unmarried women. In the 1960s, many more fragments were published in the collection of the Egyptian papyri found in a dig at an ancient garbage dump at Oxyrhynchus. Most of these fragments contain poems (partheneia), but there are also other kinds of hymns among them.

===Dialect===

Pausanias says that even though Alcman used the Doric dialect, which does not usually sound beautiful, it did not at all spoil the beauty of his songs.

Alcman&#x27;s songs were composed in the Doric dialect of Sparta (the so-called Laconian dialect). This is seen especially in the orthographic peculiarities of the fragments like α = η, ω = ου, η = ει, σ = θ and the use of the Doric accentuation, though it is uncertain whether these features were actually present in Alcman&#x27;s original compositions or were added either by Laconian performers in the subsequent generations (see Hinge&#x27;s opinion below) or even by Alexandrian scholars who gave the text a Doric feel using features of the contemporary, and not the ancient, Doric dialect.

Apollonius Dyscolus describes Alcman as &quot;constantly using the Aeolic dialect&quot;. However, the validity of this judgment is limited by the fact that it is said about the use of the digamma in the third-person pronoun &quot;his/her&quot;; it is perfectly Doric as well. Yet, many existing fragments display prosodic, morphological and phraseological features common to the Homeric language of Greek epic poetry, and even markedly Aeolic and un-Doric features (σδ = ζ, -οισα = -ουσα) which are not present in Homer itself but will pass on to all the subsequent lyric poets. This mixing of features adds complexity to any analysis of his works.

The British philologist Denys Page comes to the following conclusion about Alcman&#x27;s dialect in his influential monograph (1951):

Witczak (2016) suggests that the term – the first use of which is attributed to Alcman according to Hesychius of Alexandria (5th century CE) – may have been an early Doric loanword from Proto-Albanian.

===Metrical form===
To judge from his larger fragments, Alcman&#x27;s poetry was normally strophic: Different metres are combined into long stanzas (lines 9–14), which are repeated several times.

One popular metre is the dactylic tetrameter (in contrast to the dactylic hexameter of Homer and Hesiod).

==Content==

=== The First Partheneion ===

The type of songs Alcman composed most frequently appear to be hymns, &quot;partheneia&quot; (maiden-songs Greek &quot;maiden&quot;), and &quot;prooimia&quot; (preludes to recitations of epic poetry). Much of what little exists consists of scraps and fragments, difficult to categorize.
The most important fragment is the First Partheneion or Louvre-Partheneion, found in 1855 in Saqqara in Egypt by the French scholar Auguste Mariette. This Partheneion consists of 101 lines, of which more than 30 are severely damaged. It is very hard to say anything about this fragment, and scholars have debated ever since the discovery and publication about its content and the occasion on which this partheneion could have been performed.

The choral lyrics of Alcman were meant to be performed within the social, political, and religious context of Sparta. Most of the existing fragments are lines from &quot;partheneia&quot;. These hymns are sung by choruses of unmarried women, but it is unclear how the &quot;partheneia&quot; were performed. The Swiss scholar Claude Calame (1977) treats them as a type of drama by choruses of girls. He connects them with initiation rites.

The girls express a deep affection for their chorus leader (coryphaeus):
Earlier research tended to overlook the erotic aspect of the love of the partheneions; thus, instead of the verb translated as &quot;guards&quot;, , at the end of the first quotation, the papyrus has in fact the more explicit , &quot;wears me out (with love)&quot;. Calame states that this homoerotic love, which is similar to the one found in the lyrics of the contemporaneous poet Sappho, matches the pederasty of the males and was an integrated part of the initiation rites. At a much later period, but probably relying on older sources, Plutarch confirms that the Spartan women were engaged in such same sex relationships. It remains open if the relationship also had a physical side and, if so, of what nature.

While not denying the erotic elements of the poem, contemporary classicist Kyriakos Tsantsanoglou has argued that the latter half of the first partheneion portrays Hagesichora critically and emphasizes her absence, rather than praising her and emphasizing her approval. Tsantsanoglou&#x27;s interpretation has not been met with mainstream acceptance in classical studies.

Other scholars, among them Hutchinson and Stehle, see the First Partheneion as a song composed for a harvest ritual and not as a tribal initiation. Stehle argues that the maidens of the Partheneion carry a plough (, or, in the most translations, a robe, ) for the goddess of Dawn (Orthria). This goddess of Dawn is honoured because of the qualities she has, especially in harvest time when the Greeks harvest during dawn (Hesiod, Works and Days, ll. 575–580: &quot;Dawn gives out a third share of the work [that is, harvesting]&quot;). The heat (embodied by the Sirius-star) is a threat for the dawn, so the chorus tries to defeat him. In the meanwhile the chorus-members present themselves as women ready for marriage. Stehle doesn&#x27;t agree with Calame about the initiation-rituals, but cannot ignore the &#x27;erotic&#x27; language that the poem expresses.

Some scholars think that the chorus was divided in two halves, who would each have their own leader; at the beginning and close of their performance, the two halves performed as a single group, but during most of the performance, each half would compete with the other, claiming that their leader or favorite was the best of all the girls in Sparta. There is, however, little evidence that the chorus was in fact divided. The role of the other woman of Alcman&#x27;s first partheneion, Aenesimbrota, is contested; some consider her indeed a competing chorus-leader, others think that she was some sort of witch, who would supply the girls in love with magic love-elixirs like the &quot;pharmakeutria&quot; of Theocritus&#x27;s Second Idyll, and others again argue that she was the trainer of the chorus like Andaesistrota of Pindar&#x27;s Second Partheneion

=== Other songs ===

Alcman could have composed songs for Spartan boys as well. However, the only statement in support of this idea comes from Sosibius, a Spartan historian from the 2nd century BC. He says that songs of Alcman were performed during the Gymnopaedia festival (according to Athenaeus):

=== Praise for the gods, women, and the natural world===
Regardless of the topic, Alcman&#x27;s poetry has a clear, light, pleasant tone which ancient commentators have remarked upon. Details from rituals and festivals are described with care, even though the context of some of those details can no longer be understood.

Alcman&#x27;s language is rich with visual description. He describes the yellow color of a woman&#x27;s hair and the golden chain she wears about her neck; the purple petals of a Kalchas blossom and the purple depths of the sea; the &quot;bright shining&quot; color of the windflower and the multi-colored feathers of a bird as it chews green buds from the vines.

Much attention is focused on nature: ravines, mountains, flowering forests at night, the quiet sound of water lapping over seaweed. Animals and other creatures fill his lines: birds, horses, bees, lions, reptiles, even crawling insects.
Asleep lie mountain-top and mountain-gully, shoulder also and ravine; the creeping-things that come from the dark earth, the beasts whose lying is upon the hillside, the generation of the bees, the monsters in the depths of the purple brine, all lie asleep, and with them the tribes of the winging birds.

The poet reflects, in a poignant poem, as Antigonus of Carystus notes, how &quot;age has made him weak and unable to whirl round with the choirs and with the dancing of the maidens&quot;, unlike the cock halcyons or ceryls, for &quot;when they grow old and weak and unable to fly, their mates carry them upon their wings&quot;:
No more, O musical maidens with voices ravishing-sweet!
My limbs fail:—Ah that I were but a ceryl borne on the wing
Over the bloom of the wave amid fair young halcyons fleet,
With a careless heart untroubled, the sea-blue bird of the Spring!
=== Cosmological themes ===

Some fragments of Alcman&#x27;s poetry reflect early cosmological ideas, where he poetically describes the origins of the universe and natural phenomena. His works blend mythological narratives with reflections on the cosmos, a characteristic feature of early Greek thought before the emergence of formal philosophy. Alcman&#x27;s hymns suggest an interest in the order of the natural world, the role of primordial forces, and the creation of the cosmos; themes later explored more systematically by Presocratic philosophers like Thales, Anaximander, and Leucippus.

Scholars argue that Alcman&#x27;s poetic cosmogony represents an important step toward the philosophical inquiry that developed in ancient Greece. While he did not formulate scientific theories, his lyrical exploration of the cosmos contributed to the broader intellectual tradition of early Greek cosmology.

<text>Waterloo station (), also known as London Waterloo, is a major London terminus on the National Rail network in the United Kingdom, in the Waterloo area of the London Borough of Lambeth. It is connected to a London Underground station of the same name and is adjacent to Waterloo East station on the South Eastern Main Line. The station is the terminus of the South West Main Line to via Southampton, the West of England main line to Exeter via , the Portsmouth Direct line to which connects with ferry services to the Isle of Wight, and several commuter services around west and south-west London, Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire.

The station was opened in 1848 by the London and South Western Railway, and it replaced the earlier as it was closer to the West End. It was never designed to be a terminus, as the original intention was to continue the line towards the City of London, and consequently the station developed in a haphazard fashion, leading to difficulty finding the correct platform. The station was rebuilt in the early 20th century, opening in 1922, and included the Victory Arch over the main entrance, which commemorated World War I. Waterloo was the last London terminus to provide steam-powered services, which ended in 1967. The station was the London terminus for Eurostar international trains from 1994 until 2007, when they were transferred to St. Pancras.

Waterloo is the third busiest station in the UK, and was formerly the busiest railway station in the UK, handling 57.8 million passengers in the year to March 2023. It is also the UK&#x27;s largest station in terms of floor space and has the greatest number of platforms.

==Location==
The station&#x27;s formal name is London Waterloo, and appears as such on all official documentation. It has the station code WAT. It is in the London Borough of Lambeth on the south bank of the River Thames, close to Waterloo Bridge and northeast of Westminster Bridge. The main entrance is to the south of the junction of Waterloo Road and York Road. It is named after the eponymous bridge, which itself was named after the Battle of Waterloo, a battle that occurred exactly two years prior to the opening ceremony for the bridge.

==History==

===Background===


Waterloo was built by the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR). It was not designed to be a terminus, but a stop on an extension towards the City. It replaced the earlier , which opened on 21 May 1838 and had connected London to Southampton since 11 May 1840. By the mid-1840s, commuter services to Wandsworth, , Kingston upon Thames, and had become an important part of L&amp;SWR traffic, so the company looked for a terminus closer to Central London and the West End. An act of Parliament, the (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. clxv), was granted in 1845 to extend the line towards a site on York Road, close to Waterloo Bridge. The extension past Nine Elms involved demolishing 700 houses, and most of it was carried on a brick viaduct to minimise disruption. The longest bridge was long and took the line over Westminster Bridge Road. The approach to the new station carried four tracks, with the expectation that other companies would use it.
The station was designed by William Tite and opened on 11 July 1848 as &quot;Waterloo Bridge Station&quot;. Nine Elms closed for regular services at the same time, but Queen Victoria was fond of the privacy afforded by the old station, so it was kept open for her, and a replacement private station built on Wandsworth Road in 1854. Waterloo Bridge was originally laid out as a through station, as it was expected that services would eventually continue towards the City of London. The L&amp;SWR purchased several properties along the route, before plans were cancelled following the Panic of 1847. In October 1882, Waterloo Bridge station was officially renamed Waterloo, reflecting long-standing common usage, even in some L&amp;SWR timetables.

===Expansion===

Throughout the 19th century, the L&amp;SWR aimed to extend its main line eastward beyond into the City of London, and was reluctant to construct a dedicated grand terminus at Waterloo. Consequently, the station had none of the usual facilities expected of a terminus until 1853, when a small block was built on the far east side of the station. In 1854, the London Necropolis &amp; National Mausoleum Company opened a private station inside Waterloo that provided services to Brookwood Cemetery. The station was demolished and replaced with a dedicated building in 1902, as part of the reconstruction of Waterloo in the early 20th century.

Traffic and passengers to Waterloo increased throughout the century, and Waterloo was extended in an ad hoc manner to accommodate this. In 1860, new platforms were added on the northwest side of the station; these were known as the Windsor Station after its intended destination. An additional dock siding of the main station opened on 17 March 1869. A link to the South Eastern Railway (SER) line from to opened in July 1865. It was diverted from London Bridge to on 1 February 1867, before being withdrawn the following year. The SER opened Waterloo Junction station on 1 January 1869 as a replacement, that allowed LSWR passengers to change and access services to Cannon Street. A further extension on the southeastern side of Waterloo, to provide more services, opened on 16 December 1878. A further extension to the north, beyond the Windsor Station, opened in November 1885.

For each extension, the long-term plan was that the expansion was &quot;temporary&quot; until the line was extended past Waterloo, and these additions were added alongside and around the existing structure instead of an overall architectural plan. This resulted in the station becoming increasingly ramshackle. The platform numbering had grown in an ad hoc manner, resulting in the confusing situation of No. 1 being in the middle of the station complex, where it had been since 1848. The original station became known as the &quot;Central Station&quot; as other platforms were added. The new platform sets were known by nicknames – the two platforms added for suburban services in 1878 were the &quot;Cyprus Station&quot;, and the six built in 1885 for use by trains on the Windsor line became the &quot;Khartoum&quot;. Each of these stations-within-a-station had its own booking office, taxi stand and public entrances from the street, as well as often poorly marked and confusing access to the rest of the station.

By 1899, Waterloo had 16 platforms but only 10 numbers allocated in different sections of the station or on different levels; some numbers were duplicated. This complexity and confusion became the butt of jokes by writers and music hall comics for many years in the late 19th century, including Jerome K. Jerome in &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;. It was criticised and satirised in several &quot;Punch&quot; cartoons.

===Rebuilding===

The L&amp;SWR spent the 1880s and 1890s trying to finalise plans to continue the line beyond Waterloo to the City. An overhead line was proposed in 1882, and again in 1891, but both times was rejected due to cost. In 1893, an act was passed for a tube railway. On 8 August 1898, the company opened the Waterloo &amp; City line, a deep level underground railway that ran directly between Waterloo and Bank–Monument station in the City. This gave the company the direct commuter service it had long desired (albeit with the need to change from surface to underground lines at Waterloo). With Waterloo now destined to remain a terminus station, and with the old station becoming a source of increasingly bad will and publicity amongst the travelling public, the L&amp;SWR decided on total rebuilding, in a project they called the &quot;Great Transformation&quot;

Legal powers to carry out the work were granted in 1899 and 1900. About of land was purchased to accommodate the new building, which included six streets (and part of two others), along with All Saints&#x27; Church. The L&amp;SWR built six blocks of flats to rehouse around 1,750 people as compensation for those displaced. Extensive groundwork and slum clearance were carried out before construction on the terminus proper began, including several rundown buildings that had been extensively used for prostitution. By 1903, the land had been cleared for work to start.
The new station was opened in stages. It was partially ready in 1909, with the main booking hall opening on 11 June 1911. A vehicular roadway to the station opened on 18 December 1911. The connection to Waterloo Junction was removed in March that year, but a siding remained until 3 May 1925. The bridge remained in place and was used as a walkway between the two stations. Construction of the main station continued sporadically throughout World War I, and the new station finally opened in 1922, with 21 platforms and a long concourse. The roof and platforms were initially designed by J. W. Jacomb-Hood, who travelled to the US to look at station designs for inspiration. Following Jacomb-Hood&#x27;s death in 1914, work was taken over by Alfred Weeks Szlumper. It was built in an Imperial Baroque style out of Portland stone. James Robb Scott designed the office range. The new station included a large stained glass window depicting the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s company crest over the main road entrance, surrounded by a frieze listing the counties served by the railway (the latter still survives today). These features were retained in the design, despite the fact that, by the time the station opened, the Railways Act 1921 had been passed, which spelt the end of the L&amp;SWR as an independent concern.

Waterloo was a major terminal station for soldiers in World War I, and for sailors travelling to Southampton for the British Expeditionary Force. It also handled ambulance trains and mail from overseas. A free buffet operated at the station between December 1915 and April 1920. The station itself saw little damage, except for an explosion on one of the lines on 29 September 1917.

The rebuilt station was formally opened on 21 March 1922 by Queen Mary. The main pedestrian entrance, the Victory Arch (known as Exit 5), was designed by Scott and is a memorial to company staff who were killed during the war. Upon opening, it marked 585 employees who had been killed in World War I. It was flanked by two sculptures featuring Roman goddesses; &quot;1914&quot; with Bellona in armour with a sword and torch, and &quot;1918&quot; showing Pax, the goddess of Peace sitting on Earth.

===Southern Railway===
The LSWR began to look at electrification of suburban services during the 1910s, using a 600 volt DC third rail mechanism. The first such service to Wimbledon via East Putney opened on 25 October 1915, with services to Shepperton following on 30 January 1916, the Hounslow Loop Line on 12 March and on 18 June. Ownership of Waterloo underwent a succession, broadly typical of many British stations. Under the 1923 Grouping it passed to the Southern Railway (SR). The SR continued the third rail electrification of lines from Waterloo, including a full service to Guildford on 12 July 1925, and to Windsor on 6 July 1930.

A public address system first ran in Waterloo on 9 March 1932, and by the following decade was regularly broadcasting music around the station. In 1934, the SR planned to invest £500,000 (£ million as of ) to improve the signalling and track layout to allow better use of all platforms. A full electric service to Woking, Guildford and (for the Isle of Wight) opened on 4 July 1937, as did connecting services to and . On 1 January 1939 an electric service opened between Waterloo and Reading, with a branch to and Aldershot, which was designed equally for the anticipated increase in military traffic in the area as well as commuters.

Waterloo was bombed several times during World War II. On 7 September 1940, the John Street viaduct immediately outside the station was destroyed by a bomb, which prevented any services running for 12 days. Full services did not resume until 1 October, which particularly affected mail traffic with over 5,000 unsorted bags piling up on the station platform. Waterloo was closed again after bombing on 29 December 1940. It re-opened on 5 January 1941, on the same day that station offices on York Road were destroyed by bombing. The station took heavy damage again after an overnight raid on 10–11 May 1941, with fires lasting for four days. One bomb was not discovered until it was uncovered during building work along York Road in 1959.

===British Rail and privatisation===
Following nationalisation in 1948, ownership of the station transferred to British Railways (BR) as part of the Southern Region. Under BR, more of the network was electrified and boat train traffic declined in favour of air travel. Waterloo was the last London terminus to run steam-hauled trains. The final journey took place on 9 July 1967 and featured a large group of rail enthusiasts with cameras and recording equipment, attempting to capture the departure of the final steam service to . The electrified service began the next day.

The station was managed by Network SouthEast also under BR. Following the privatisation of British Rail, ownership and management passed to Railtrack in April 1994 and finally, in 2002, to Network Rail.

===Eurostar===

Although the London terminus of the international railway connection via the Channel Tunnel had long planned to be in the north of London, the major construction works required to accommodate this plan had not started by the time the Channel Tunnel was completed in 1994. Instead, five new platforms were built on the western side of Waterloo station, replacing platforms 20 and 21. The new Waterloo International railway station was the first London terminus of Eurostar international trains to Gare du Nord, Paris and . An inaugural service left Waterloo on 6 May for a joint opening ceremony with Queen Elizabeth II and the French president François Mitterrand. Regular services began on 14 November. Construction necessitated the removal of decorative masonry forming two arches from that side of the station, bearing the legend &quot;Southern Railway&quot;. This was re-erected at the private Fawley Hill Museum of Sir William McAlpine, whose company built Waterloo International.

In the meantime, London and Continental Railways (LCR), created at the time of British Rail privatisation, was selected by the government in 1996 to reconstruct St Pancras railway station, which it had owned since privatisation, as well as a new rail connection, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL), to link St Pancras to the Channel Tunnel.

Construction of the CTRL, the second phase of High Speed 1, was completed in 2007, and Waterloo International closed on 13 November 2007 when the Eurostar service transferred to the new St Pancras International station. Ownership of the former Waterloo International terminal then passed to BRB (Residuary) Limited.

===Heathrow Airport links===
Waterloo station was to be the central London terminus for the proposed Heathrow Airtrack rail service. This project, promoted by British Airport Authority Limited (BAA), envisaged the construction of a spur, from on the Waterloo to Reading line, to Heathrow Airport, creating direct rail links from the airport to Waterloo, and Guildford. Airtrack was planned to open in 2015, but was abandoned by BAA during 2011. That October, Wandsworth Council proposed a revised plan called Airtrack-Lite, which would provide trains from Waterloo to Heathrow, via the same proposed spur from Staines to Heathrow, but, by diverting or splitting current services, the frequency of trains over the existing level crossings would not increase. BAA&#x27;s earlier plan had controversially proposed more trains over the level crossings, leading to concerns that they would be closed to motorists and pedestrians for too long.

===Former international platforms===
After the transfer of Eurostar services from Waterloo, the former Eurostar platforms 20–24 of Waterloo International remained unused until they were fully brought back into service in May 2019, after partial re-opening in December 2018. Waterloo suffered significant capacity problems, until the former international station were brought back into service for domestic use. In December 2008 preparatory work was carried out to enable platform 20 to be used by South West Trains suburban services. However, the conversion of the remaining platforms was delayed as it required alterations to the track layout outside the station. Platforms 20–22 were reopened for domestic use at the end of 2018. The final set, 23–24, opened in May 2019. The refurbishment and reopening of platforms 20–24 increased capacity at Waterloo by 30%. The international platforms were only designed to cope with six trains per hour, well below the current capacity for commuter services.

The project was criticised for its delayed completion date; in 2009 the Department for Transport confirmed that Network Rail was developing High Level Output Specification options for the station, with an estimated date for the re-opening of the platforms of 2014, seven years after their closure. The cost of maintaining the disused platforms up to late 2010 was found via a Freedom of Information request to have been £4.1 million. South West Trains subsequently confirmed that platform 20 would be brought back into use in 2014, hosting certain services to and from Reading, Windsor, Staines and Hounslow. These would be 10-car trains newly formed from refurbished SWT and former Gatwick Express rolling stock. Platform 20 reopened in May, with access via platform 19, and platforms 21 and 22 in October after steps were constructed over the former Eurostar entrance to access the platforms.

===Platform lengthening (1–4)===
In May 2016, it was announced that platforms 1 to 4 would be lengthened to allow new ten-car Class 707 trains to run. Work started on 5 August 2017, and was completed on 28 August.

==Accidents and incidents==
There have been relatively few accidents at Waterloo compared to other London terminal stations. On 21 August 1896, an engine leaving the locomotive yard overran its clearance point, colliding with a departing passenger train. Five passengers were injured. On 5 May 1904, a linesman accidentally stepped on a signal wire. This gave a false clear signal to a goods van, which collided with a passenger train, killing one, while on 25 October 1913, a collision between two passenger trains at Waterloo Junction killed three people.

On 13 April 1948, the goods hoist to the Waterloo and City line began to sink while a M7 class tank engine was pushing loaded coal wagons onto it. The engine dropped into the hoist&#x27;s shaft, ending up upside-down and spurting steam over it. The driver and fireman managed to jump free, and the locomotive was rescued piecemeal and used for spares.

On 3 June 1960, an empty stock train formed of two 4COR electric multiple units overran signals and was in a sidelong collision with a steam-hauled passenger train that was departing for , Dorset. A few people suffered slight injuries. On 11 April the following year, an electric multiple unit overran signals and was in a head-on collision with a steam locomotive. One person was killed and fifteen were injured.

On 10 March 2000, a passenger train collided with an empty stock train in platform 5 due to driver error. Thirty-five people were injured.

On 15 August 2017, a Class 456 electric multiple unit collided with an engineers&#x27; train at the station. The passenger train was derailed, causing disruption for the remainder of the day. Three people were checked for injuries, but nobody was hospitalised. The cause was both a change to the interlocking, that failed to be accounted for in the test regime and that a temporary connection for testing had not been removed (probably added to overcome the change to the interlocking – it was entirely undocumented and unapproved) which meant that a set of points not correctly set was not detected. This allowed a proceed signal to be shown when it should not have been possible to do so. The problem would have been indicated to the signaller when a previous train &#x27;ran through&#x27; the points and moved them had the temporary connection been removed. The temporary connection prevented this detection by providing a false feed to the detection relay. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) investigation into the accident concluded that mistakes were made similar to those which caused the Clapham Junction rail crash in 1988. The RAIB expressed concerns that lessons learnt from that accident were being forgotten over time.

==Station facilities==

The major transport interchange at Waterloo comprises London Waterloo, Waterloo East, Waterloo Underground station, and several bus stops. There are more than 130 automated ticket gates on the station concourse, along with another 27 in the subway below.

A four-faced clock hangs in the middle of the main concourse. Each panel has a diameter of . It was erected as part of the early 20th century rebuilding and designed by Gents&#x27; of Leicester. In 2010, the clock was fitted with technology to automatically switch to and from British Summer Time. Meeting &quot;under the clock at Waterloo&quot; is a traditional rendezvous.

===Platforms===
There are 24 platforms at this station, numbered 1–24 from the South East to the North West (left to right when viewed from the passenger entrance):
* Platforms 1–6 are generally used for suburban services on the South West Main Line towards Wimbledon, Guildford and Woking.
* Platforms 7–16 are generally used for long distance service on the South West Main Line towards Basingstoke, Portsmouth, Weymouth and Exeter
* Platforms 17–24 are generally used for services on the Waterloo–Reading line.

In contrast, platforms at are lettered to avoid confusion with the numbered platforms at this station.

===Retail balcony===
Network Rail has constructed a balcony along almost the whole width of the concourse at the first-floor level. The project&#x27;s aims were to provide 18 new retail spaces and a champagne bar, reduce congestion on the concourse, and improve access to Waterloo East station by providing additional escalators leading to the high-level walkway between Waterloo and Waterloo East. Retail and catering outlets have been removed from the concourse to make more circulation space. First-floor offices have been converted into replacement and additional retail and catering spaces. Work was completed in July 2012, at a cost of £25 million.

===Police station===
The British Transport Police maintained a police station by the Victory Arch at Waterloo, with a custody suite of three cells. Although relatively cramped, it served over 40 police officers until the late 1990s. The police station shut in February 2009, following the closure of the Eurostar Terminal at Waterloo. The railway station is now policed from a new Inner London Police Station a few yards from Waterloo at Holmes Terrace. Until July 2010, the Neighbourhood Policing Team for Waterloo consisted of an inspector, a sergeant, two constables, special constables, and 13 police community support officers.

=== Bus station ===
A large number of London Buses routes serve the station area day and night. A bus station on Waterloo Road located opposite the BFI IMAX was opened in summer 2004.

==Services==
===South Western Railway===
The main part of the railway station complex is known as &quot;Waterloo Main&quot; or simply Waterloo. This is the London terminus for services towards the south coast and the south-west of England. All regular trains are operated by South Western Railway. Waterloo main line station is one of nineteen in the country that are managed by Network Rail and the station complex is in London fare zone 1.

Waterloo has been Britain&#x27;s busiest railway station by patronage, with just under 100 million National Rail passenger entries/exits in 2015–16. Waterloo railway station alone is the 91st-busiest in the world as of 2013. However, including National Rail interchanges, the Underground station, and Waterloo East, the complex handled a total of 211 million arrivals and departures in the 2015/2016 financial year (not including interchanges on the Underground). It is therefore the busiest transport hub in Europe. It has more platforms and a greater floor area than any other station in the UK (though Clapham Junction, just under down the line, sees the greatest number of passengers alighting or departing trains). 

As of 2017, the South Western Railway run around 1,600 trains per day, used by over 651,000 passengers, making it Europe&#x27;s busiest commuter service. According to the Estimates of Station Usage, there were 94,192,690 entries and exits at Waterloo during 2018–19, continuing to be the highest in the country. Along with other stations, usage dropped dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, Waterloo was the busiest railway station in the UK, with an estimated 86.9 million passenger entries/exits. It had been the busiest in the country for 16 consecutive years until patronage fell 86% in 2020/21 to 12.2 million due to the pandemic, ranking it fourth in terms of usage. In 2023, London Liverpool Street overtook it as the busiest in London, as well as the United Kingdom as a whole, following the completion of the Elizabeth line.

The following off-peak weekday services are operated in trains per hour (tph) as of December 2023:

===Southeastern===

Adjacent to the main station is , the last stop on the South Eastern Main Line towards London before the terminus at Charing Cross. Waterloo East has four platforms, which are lettered A to D rather than numbered to avoid confusion with the numbered platforms in the main station by staff who work at both stations. Waterloo East is managed and branded separately from the main station. Trains go to southeast London, Kent and parts of East Sussex. All regular services are operated by Southeastern.

During August 2017, some Southeastern trains were diverted into Waterloo via the former Eurostar connection line between Vauxhall and Clapham High Street whilst engineering works took place between Hither Green and London Charing Cross/Cannon Street/Blackfriars via London Bridge.

===River===
London River Services operate boats from nearby London Eye Pier (also known as the Waterloo Millennium Pier) and Festival Pier, and run to the City and Greenwich. The piers also provide access to corporate and leisure services.

==London Underground==

There had been plans to connect Waterloo to the West End via an underground railway since the 1860s. The Waterloo &amp; Whitehall Railway began construction of a line towards Whitehall, but it was abandoned in 1868 because of financial difficulties. The first underground line to be opened at Waterloo was the Waterloo &amp; City Railway to Bank, colloquially known as &quot;The Drain&quot; owing to its access via a sloping subway at the Bank end. It opened on 8 August 1898, and was part-owned by the L&amp;SWR, who took over full ownership in 1907. It was primarily designed for commuters and not normally open on Sundays. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the line has only been open on weekdays.

The Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (now part of the Bakerloo line) opened on 10 March 1906, and was initially accessed from Waterloo by lifts at the York Road end of the station. The Northern line&#x27;s station at Waterloo opened on 13 September 1926, as part of the overall extension from Charing Cross to Kennington. The Jubilee line station opened on 24 September 1999 as part of the eastward extension to Stratford.

==Cultural references==
In the 1990s, after Waterloo station was chosen as the British terminus for the Eurostar train service, Florent Longuepée, a municipal councillor in Paris, wrote to the British Prime Minister requesting that the station be renamed because he said it was upsetting for the French to be reminded of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat when they arrived in London by Eurostar. There is a name counterpart in Paris: the Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz is named after the Battle of Austerlitz, one of Napoleon&#x27;s greatest victories (over the Russians and Austrians).

The clock at Waterloo has been cited as one of the most romantic spots for a couple to meet, and fictional examples include Derek &quot;Del Boy&quot; Trotter meeting Raquel in the British sit-com &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; and Jack meeting Nancy in the film &quot;Man Up&quot;.
Waterloo has appeared in fiction several times. In Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s 1889 comic novel, &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;, the protagonists spend some time in the station, trying to find their train to Kingston upon Thames. After being given contradictory information by every railway employee they speak to, they eventually bribe a train driver to take his train to their destination. In Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne&#x27;s 1889 novel &quot;The Wrong Box&quot;, much of the farcical plot revolves around the misdelivery of two boxes at Waterloo station, and the attempts by the various protagonists to retrieve them. In H. G. Wells&#x27; 1897 science fiction novel, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, the little used, and long since vanished, connecting track across the station concourse to Waterloo East station makes an appearance. John Cowper Powys refers to the Waterloo Station steps in &quot;Wolf Solent&quot; where his protagonist, when leaving Waterloo for Dorset at the start of the novel, sees a vagrant with a face of &quot;inert despair&quot; who haunts him throughout the ensuing action as a reminder of eternal human suffering. The station features prominently in the action film &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;, with a complex chase sequence and assassination.

The station is the subject of John Schlesinger&#x27;s 1961 documentary film &quot;Terminus&quot;, while the 1970 British Transport film &quot;Rush Hour&quot; includes several scenes filmed in the station. The underground scenes in the 1998 romantic comedy &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; were partly shot at Waterloo tube station.

Two well-received images of the station are the two Southern Railway posters &quot;Waterloo Station – War&quot; and &quot;Waterloo Station – Peace&quot;, painted by Helen McKie for the 1948 centenary of the station. The two pictures show hundreds of busy travellers all in exactly the same positions and poses, but with altered clothing and roles. The preparatory sketches for these were drawn between 1939 and 1942.

 In 1981, Shell UK ran a competition a work of art to be exhibited above Waterloo&#x27;s Shell exit. The winner, Jane Boyd, went on to be Fellow Commoner in Creative Arts at Trinity College, Cambridge. Other paintings of the station include the huge 1967 work by Terence Cuneo, in the collection of the National Railway Museum. A statue of Terence Cuneo by Philip Jackson was installed on the concourse in 2004. It was removed in 2014 during remodelling of the concourse.

In 2010, two of the disused platforms hosted a theatrical performance of &quot;The Railway Children&quot; by E. Nesbit. The audience was seated either side of the actual railway track. The show included the use of a steam locomotive coupled to one of the original carriages from the 1970s film (propelled by a diesel locomotive). The performance moved to London after two acclaimed summer runs at the National Railway Museum in York.

Waterloo and Waterloo Underground are the setting for the Kinks&#x27; song &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;, recorded in 1967. It was originally titled &quot;Liverpool Sunset&quot; but changed as the band decided there were too many songs about that city. Its lyric describes two people (Terry and Julie) meeting at Waterloo Station and crossing the river, and was also inspired by the 1951 Festival of Britain. The band&#x27;s biographer, Nick Hasted said the song &quot;has made millions contemplatively pause around Waterloo, a busy urban area the record gives a sacred glow&quot;.

<text>Convex Computer Corporation was a company that developed, manufactured and marketed vector minisupercomputers and supercomputers for small-to-medium-sized businesses. Their later Exemplar series of parallel computing machines were based on the Hewlett-Packard (HP) PA-RISC microprocessors, and in 1995, HP bought the company. Exemplar machines were offered for sale by HP for some time, and Exemplar technology was used in HP&#x27;s V-Class machines.

==History==

Convex was formed in 1982 by Bob Paluck and Steve Wallach in Richardson, Texas. It was originally named Parsec and early prototype and production boards bear that name. They planned on producing a machine very similar in architecture to the Cray Research vector processor machines, with a somewhat lower performance, but with a much better price–performance ratio. In order to lower costs, the Convex designs were not as technologically aggressive as Cray&#x27;s, and were based on more mainstream chip technology, attempting to make up for the loss in performance in other ways.
Their first machine was the C1, released in 1985. The C1 was very similar to the Cray-1 in general design, but its CPU and main memory was implemented with slower but less expensive CMOS technology. They offset this by increasing the capabilities of the vector units, including doubling the vector registers&#x27; length to 128 64-bit elements each. It also used virtual memory as opposed to the static memory system of the Cray machines, which improved programming. It was generally rated at 20 MFLOPS peak for double precision (64-bit), and 40 MFLOPS peak for single precision (32-bit), about one fifth the normal speed of the Cray-1. They also invested heavily in advanced automatic vectorizing compilers in order to gain performance when existing programs were ported to their systems. The machines ran a BSD version of Unix known initially as Convex Unix then later as ConvexOS due to trademark and licensing issues. ConvexOS has DEC VMS compatibility features, known by the product name of COVUE (CONVEX-to-VAX User Environment), as well as Cray Fortran features. Their Fortran compiler went on to be licensed to other computers such as Ardent Computer and Stellar (and merged Stardent).
The C2 was a crossbar-interconnected multiprocessor version of the C1, with up to four CPUs, released in 1988. It used newer 20,000-gate CMOS and 10,000-gate emitter-coupled logic (ECL) gate arrays for a boost in clock speed from 10 MHz to 25 MHz, and rated at 50 MFLOPS peak for double precision per CPU (100 MFLOPS peak for single precision). It was Convex&#x27;s most successful product.

The C2 was followed by the C3 in 1991, being essentially similar to the C2 but with a faster clock and support for up to eight CPUs implemented with low-density GaAs FPGAs. Various configurations of the C3 were offered, with 50 to 240 MFLOPS per CPU. However, the C3 and the Convex business model were overtaken by changes in the computer industry. The arrival of RISC microprocessors meant that it was no longer possible to develop cost-effective high-performance computing as a standalone small low-volume company. While the C3 was delivered late, which resulted in lost sales, it was still not going to be able to compete with commodity high-performance computing in the long run.

Another speed boost used in the C3 and C4, which moved the hardware implementation to GaAs-based chips, following an evolution identical to that of the Cray machines, but the effort was too little, too late. Some considered the whole C4 program to be nothing more than chasing a business in decline. By this time, even though Convex was the first vendor to ship a GaAs based product, they were losing money.

In 1994, Convex introduced an entirely new design, known as the Exemplar. Unlike the C-series vector computer, the Exemplar was a parallel-computing machine that used HP PA-7200 microprocessors, connected together using SCI. First dubbed MPP, these machines were later called SPP and Exemplar and sold under the SPP-1600 moniker. The expectation was that a software programming model for parallel computing could draw in customers. But the type of customers Convex attracted believed in Fortran and brute force rather than sophisticated technology. The operating system also had terrible performance problems which could not easily be fixed. Eventually, Convex established a working partnership with HP&#x27;s hardware and software divisions. Initially it was intended that the Exemplar would be binary-compatible with HP&#x27;s HP-UX operating system but eventually it was decided to port HP-UX to the platform and sell the platform as standalone servers.
In 1995, Hewlett-Packard bought Convex. HP sold Convex Exemplar machines under the S-Class (MP) and X-Class (CC-NUMA) titles, and later incorporated some of Exemplar&#x27;s technology into the V-Class machine, which was released running the HP-UX 11.0 release instead of the SPP-UX version which was sold with the S- and X-Class products.

<text>Ibycus (; ; ) was an Ancient Greek lyric poet, a citizen of Rhegium in Magna Graecia, probably active at Samos during the reign of the tyrant Polycrates and numbered by the scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria in the canonical list of nine lyric poets. He was mainly remembered in antiquity for pederastic verses, but he also composed lyrical narratives on mythological themes in the manner of Stesichorus. His work survives today only as quotations by ancient scholars or recorded on fragments of papyrus recovered from archaeological sites in Egypt, yet his extant verses include what are considered some of the finest examples of Greek poetry. 

As is the case with many other major poets of ancient Greece, Ibycus became famous not just for his poetry but also for events in his life, largely the stuff of legend: the testimonia are difficult to interpret and very few biographical facts are actually known.

==Life==
The Byzantine encyclopaedia Suda represents a good example of a problematic biography, here translated by David Campbell:
Suda&#x27;s chronology has been dismissed as &quot;muddled&quot; since it makes Ibycus about a generation older than Anacreon, another poet known to have flourished at the court of Polycrates, and it is inconsistent with what we know of the Samian tyrant from Herodotus. Eusebius recorded the poet&#x27;s first experience of fame (&quot;agnoscitur&quot;) somewhere between 542 and 537 BC and this better fits the period of Polycrates&#x27; reign. Suda&#x27;s account seems to be corroborated by a papyrus fragment (&quot;P.Oxy.&quot;1790), usually ascribed to Ibycus, glorifying a youthful Polycrates, but this was unlikely to have been the Polycrates of Samos and might instead have been his son, mentioned in a different context by Himerius as Polycrates, governor of Rhodes. Suda&#x27;s list of fathers of Ibycus also presents problems: there were no historians in the early 6th century and &quot;Cerdas&quot; looks like an invention of the comic stage (it has low associations).

There was a Pythagorean lawgiver of Rhegium known as Phytius, but the early 6th century is too early for this candidate also. Ibycus gives no indication of being a Pythagorean himself, except in one poem he identifies the Morning Star with the Evening Star, an identity first popularized by Pythagoras. 

Ibycus provided the first attestation of an historical Thracian or Thraco-Dacian bard Orpheus, purported composer of the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot;; (&quot;The earliest literary reference to Orpheus is a two-word fragment of the 6th century BC lyric poet Ibycus of Samos: onomaklyton Orphēn (&#x27;Orpheus famous-of-name&#x27;).&quot;), whose name might indicate an origin in slavery {Orpheus#Etymology}. Not incidentally, enslavenemnt of Thraco-Dacians in Samos, in particular, is also (dimly) attested by the history of another such personnage who rose to prominence among the pre-Hellenistic Greeks: namely, X/Zalmoxis, reputedly a Thraco-Dacian slave in the household of reputed-one-time Hierophant of Eleusis, Pythagoras (also of Samos). X/Zalmoxis apparently achieved some form of apprenticeship with that most famous practitioner of Pythagoreanism, and evidently goes on to earn his freedom as well as a reputation as a great healer of &#x27;body and soul (psyche),&#x27; via Plato (see Zalmoxis#&quot;Religion of the Getae&quot;) ...Plato attributes an holistic approach to healing body and soul (psyche)... in the latter case, not unlike Orpheus..who ended up with a cave-based oracle in nearby Lesbos island, in the region of Ionia&#x27;s northern neighbors, the Aeolians. Notably, Using music to relieve lustful urges was a Pythagorean remedy stemming from an anecdote from the life of Pythagoras claiming that, when he encountered some drunken youths trying to break into the home of a virtuous woman, he sang a solemn tune with long spondees and the boys&#x27; &quot;raging willfulness&quot; was quelled. 
Suda&#x27;s extraordinary account of the poet&#x27;s death is found in other sources, such as Plutarch and Antipater of Sidon and later it inspired Friedrich Schiller to write a ballad called &quot;The Cranes of Ibycus&quot; yet the legend might be derived merely from a play upon the poet&#x27;s name and the Greek word for the bird or &quot;ibyx&quot;—it might even have been told of somebody else originally. Another proverb associated with Ibycus was recorded by Diogenianus: &quot;more antiquated than Ibycus&quot; or &quot;more silly than Ibycus&quot;. The proverb was apparently based on an anecdote about Ibycus stupidly or nobly turning down an opportunity to become tyrant of Rhegium in order to pursue a poetic career instead (one modern scholar however infers from his poetry that Ibycus was in fact wise enough to avoid the lure of supreme power, citing as an example Plato&#x27;s quotation from one of his lyrics: &quot;I am afraid it may be in exchange for some sin before the gods that I get honour from men&quot;). There is no other information about Ibycus&#x27; activities in the West, apart from an account by Himerius, that he fell from his chariot while travelling between Catana and Himera and injured his hand badly enough to give up playing the lyre &quot;for some considerable time.&quot; 

Some modern scholars have found in the surviving poetry evidence that Ibycus might have spent time at Sicyon before journeying to Samos—mythological references indicate local knowledge of Sicyon and could even point to the town&#x27;s alliance with Sparta against Argos and Athens. His depiction of the women of Sparta as &quot;thigh-showing&quot; (quoted by Plutarch as proof of lax morals among the women there) is vivid enough to suggest that he might have composed some verses in Sparta also. It is possible that he left Samos at the same time as Anacreon, on the death of Polycrates, and there is an anonymous poem in the Palatine Anthology celebrating Rhegium as his final resting place, describing a tomb located under an elm, covered in ivy and white reeds.

==Poetry==
Ibycus&#x27; role in the development of Greek lyric poetry was as a mediator between eastern and western styles: 

Although scholars like Bowra have concluded that his style must have changed with his setting, such a neat distinction is actually hard to prove from the existing verses, which are an intricate blend of
the public, &quot;choral&quot; style of Stesichorus, and the private, &quot;soloist&quot; style of the Lesbian poets. It is not certain that he ever in fact composed monody (lyrics for solo performance), but the emotional and erotic quality of his verse, and the fact that his colleague in Samos was Anacreon, who did compose monody, suggest that Ibycus did too. On the other hand, some modern scholars believe that &#x27;choral&#x27; lyrics were actually performed by soloists and therefore maybe all Ibycus&#x27; work was monody. He modelled his work on the &quot;choral&quot; lyrics of Stesichorus at least in so far as he wrote narratives on mythical themes (often with original variations from the traditional stories) and structured his verses in triads (units of three stanzas each, called &quot;strophe&quot;, &quot;antistrophe&quot; and &quot;epode&quot;), so closely in fact that even the ancients sometimes had difficulty distinguishing between the two poets Whereas however ancient scholars collected the work of Stesichorus into twenty-six books, each probably a self-contained narrative that gave its title to the whole book, they compiled only seven books for Ibycus, which were numbered rather than titled and whose selection criteria are unknown. Recent papyrus finds suggest also that Ibycus might have been the first to compose &#x27;choral&#x27; victory odes (an innovation usually credited to Simonides).

Until the 1920s, all that survived of Ibycus&#x27; work were two large-ish fragments (one seven, the other thirteen lines long) and about fifty other lines scraped together from a variety of ancient commentaries. Since then, papyrus finds have greatly added to the store of Ibycean verses – notably, and controversially, forty-eight continuous lines addressed to Polycrates, whose identification with Polycrates of Rhodes (son of Polycrates, the Samian tyrant) requires a careful selection of historical sources. Authorship of the poem is attributed to Ibycus on textual and historical grounds but its quality as verse is open to debate: &quot;insipid&quot;, &quot;inept and slovenly&quot; or, more gently, &quot;not an unqualified success&quot; and optimally &quot;the work of a poet realizing a new vision, with a great command of epic material which he could manipulate for encomiastic effect.&quot; In the poem, Ibycos parades the names and characteristics of heroes familiar from Homer&#x27;s Trojan epic, as types of people the poem is not about, until he reaches the final stanza, where he reveals that his real subject is Polycrates, whom he says he will immortalize in verse. This &quot;puzzling&quot; poem has been considered historically significant by some scholars as a signal from Ibycus that he is now turning his back on epic themes to concentrate on love poetry instead: a new vision or &quot;recusatio&quot;. 

He composed like Stesichorus in a literary language, largely Epic with some Doric flavouring, and with a few Aeolisms that he borrowed from the love poetry of Sappho and Alcaeus. It is possible however that the Doric dialect was added by editors in Hellenistic and Roman times, when the poet&#x27;s home town, Rhegium, had become more Doric than it had been in the poet&#x27;s own time. In addition to this &quot;superficial element of Doric dialect&quot;, the style of Ibycus features mainly dactylic rhythms (reflecting the Epic traditions he shared with Stesichorus), a love theme and accumulated epithets. His use of imagery can seem chaotic but it is justified as an artistic effect. His style has been described by one modern scholar as &quot;graceful and passionate.&quot; The ancients sometimes considered his work with distaste as a lecherous and corrupting influence but they also responded sympathetically to the pathos he sought to evoke—his account of Menelaus&#x27;s failure to kill Helen of Troy, under the spell of her beauty, was valued by ancient critics above Euripides&#x27;s account of the same story in his play Andromache.

=== Example ===
The following lines, dedicated to a lover, Euryalus, were recorded by Athenaeus as a famous example of amorous praise:
:::
:::

The rich language of these lines, in particular the accumulation of epithets, typical of Ibycus, is shown in the following translation: 
:::Euryalus, offshoot of the blue-eyed Graces, darling of the lovely-haired Seasons, the Cyprian and soft-lidded Persuasion nursed you among rose-blossoms.
This mythological account of his lover recalls Hesiod&#x27;s account of Pandora, who was decked out by the same goddesses (the Graces, the Seasons and Persuasion) so as to be a bane to mankind—an allusion consistent with Ibycus&#x27;s view of love as unavoidable turmoil.

===Fragment 286===
The following poem was quoted by the ancient scholar Athenaeus in his wide-ranging discourses &quot;Scholars at Dinner&quot; and it demonstrates some of the characteristics of Ibycean verse:
:::In spring the Kydonian
:::apple trees, watered by flowing
:::streams there where the Maidens
:::have their unravished garden, and vine buds,
:::growing under the shadowy branches
:::of the vines, bloom and flourish. For me, however, love
:::is at rest in no season
:::but like the Thracian north wind,
:::ablaze with lightning,
:::rushing from Aphrodite with scorching
:::fits of madness, dark and unrestrained,
:::it forcibly convulses from their very roots
:::my mind and heart.
The poem establishes a contrast between the tranquility of nature and the ever restless impulses to which the poet&#x27;s desires subject him, while the images and epithets accumulate almost chaotically, communicating a sense of his inner turmoil. In the original Greek, initial tranquility is communicated by repeated vowel sounds in the first six lines. His love of nature and his ability to describe it in lively images are reminiscent of Sappho&#x27;s work.

==Reception==
*In book four of Apollonius Rhodius&#x27;s &quot;Argonautica&quot;, the goddess Hera reveals that Achilles is destined to marry Medea in the Elysian Fields (&quot;Argonautica&quot; 4.811–15). A scholiast on the passage comments that this account was first put forward by Ibycus, and that it was also taken up by Simonides of Ceos. In another scholium, it is said that the Argonautica&#x27;s account of Ganymede&#x27;s abduction by an amorous Zeus (&quot;Argonautica&quot; 3.114–17) was also modelled on a version by Ibycus (in Homer&#x27;s earlier account, Zeus abducted the youth to be his wine-pourer: &quot;Iliad&quot; 20.234), and that Ibycus, moreover, described the abduction of Tithonus by Dawn (Eos). Apollonius Rhodius represented Eros as a child of Aphrodite (&quot;Argonautica&quot; 3.25–6) and there is a relevant scholium on that passage too, according to which Sappho made Eros the son of Earth and Heaven, Simonides made him the son of Aphrodite and Ares, and Ibycus made him the son of ...? The section is lost, but it has been suggested that he made Eros the son of Aphrodite and Hephaestus
*Parmenides seems to have admired Ibycus&#x27;s work because he cites him in Plato&#x27;s dialogue of the same name.
*Friedrich Schiller based his 1797 ballad Die Kraniche des Ibykus (The Cranes Of Ibycus) on the rendition of the poet‘s murder.

<doc id="78382" wikidata="Q506540" url="?curid=78382" title="Didymus Chalcenterus">
<text>Didymus Chalcenterus (Latin; Greek: , &quot;Dídymos Chalkéderos&quot;, &quot;Didymus Bronze-Guts&quot;; c. 63 BC – c. AD 10) was an Ancient Greek scholar and grammarian who flourished in the time of Cicero and Augustus.

== Life ==
The epithet &quot;Bronze-Guts&quot; came from his indefatigable industry: he was said to have written so many books that he was unable to recollect what he had written in earlier ones, and so often contradicted himself. Athenaeus (4.139c) records that he wrote 3,500 treatises, while Seneca gives the figure of 4,000. As a result, he acquired the additional nickname (, &quot;biblioláthas&quot;), meaning &quot;Book-Forgetting&quot; or &quot;Book-forgetter&quot;, a term coined by Demetrius of Troezen.

He lived and taught in Alexandria and Rome, where he became the friend of Varro. He is chiefly important as having introduced Alexandrian learning to the Romans.

== Works ==
He was a follower of the school of Aristarchus, and wrote a treatise on Aristarchus&#x27; edition of Homer entitled &quot;On Aristarchus&#x27; recension&quot; ( &quot;perí tís Aristárchou diorthoséos&quot;), fragments of which are preserved in the Venetus A manuscript of the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

He also wrote monographs on many other Greek poets and prose authors. He is known to have written on Hesiod, the Greek lyric poets, notably Bacchylides and Pindar, and on drama; the better part of the Pindar and Sophocles scholia originated with Didymus. The Aristophanes scholia also cite him often, and he is known to have written treatises on Euripides, Ion, Phrynichus&#x27;s &quot;Kronos&quot;, Cratinus, Menander, and many of the Greek orators including Demosthenes, Aeschines, Isaeus, Hypereides and Deinarchus.

Besides these commentaries there are mentions of the following works, none of which survives:

* &quot;On phraseology in tragedy&quot; ( &quot;perí tragodouménis léxeos&quot;), which comprised at least 28 books
* &quot;Comic phraseology&quot; ( &quot;léxis komikí&quot;), of which Hesychius made much use
* a third linguistic work on words of ambiguous or uncertain meaning, comprising at least seven books
* a fourth linguistic work on false or corrupt expressions
* a collection of Greek proverbs ( &quot;perí parimión&quot;) in 13 books, from which most of the proverbs in Zenobius&#x27; collection are taken.
* &quot;On the law-tablets of Solon&quot; ( &quot;perí tón axónon Sólonos&quot;), a work mentioned by Plutarch.
* He is attributed with writing a critique of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De re publica&quot;, comprising six books, referred to by Ammianus Marcellinus (22.16), which provoked Suetonius to counter with a defense of that Roman writer. The authenticity of the attribution has been questioned on the grounds there is no evidence Didymus knew Latin, and the suggestion the source may have confused Didymus Chalcenterus with Claudius Didymus, who wrote a critique of Thucydides&#x27; style, and a work comparing Latin and Greek.

In addition, there survive extracts on agriculture and botany, mention of a commentary on Hippocrates, and a completely surviving treatise &quot;On all types of marble and wood&quot; ( &quot;perí marmáron kai pantoíon xýlon&quot;). In view of the drastic difference in subject matter, it is possible that these represent the work of a different Didymos.

The Stoic philosopher Seneca, in his &quot;Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium&quot;, claims that Didymus wrote 4,000 books, while making a commentary on the acquisition of useless knowledge.

Further insight into Didymus&#x27; methods of writing was provided by the discovery of a papyrus fragment of his commentary on the Philippics of Demosthenes. This confirms that he was not an original researcher, but a scrupulous compiler who made many quotations from earlier writers, and who was prepared to comment about chronology and history, as well as rhetoric and style.

<doc id="78385" wikidata="Q259667" url="?curid=78385" title="The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico">
<text>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico is the debut studio album by the American rock band the Velvet Underground and the German singer Nico. Released by Verve Records in March 1967, the album underperformed in sales and polarized critics upon release due to its abrasive, unconventional sound and controversial lyrical content. It later became regarded as one of the most influential albums in rock and pop music and one of the greatest albums of all time.

&quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; was recorded in 1966 while the band were featured on Andy Warhol&#x27;s Exploding Plastic Inevitable tour. Warhol, who designed the album&#x27;s record sleeve, co-produced with Tom Wilson. The album features elements of avant-garde music incorporated into brash, minimal and groove-driven rock music. Primary singer Lou Reed delivers explicit lyrics spanning themes of drug abuse, prostitution, sadomasochism and urban life. Characterized as &quot;the original art-rock record&quot;, it was a major influence on many subgenres of rock and alternative music, including punk, garage rock, krautrock, post-punk, post-rock, noise rock, shoegaze, gothic rock, and indie rock. In 1982, the English musician Brian Eno said that while the album only sold approximately 30,000 copies in its first five years, &quot;everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band&quot;.

&quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; has been included on several all-time lists, including that of Apple Music and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2006, it was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Recording==
&quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; was recorded with the first professional line-up of the Velvet Underground: Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker. At the instigation of their mentor and manager Andy Warhol, and his collaborator Paul Morrissey, German singer Nico was also featured; she had occasionally performed lead vocals for the band. She sang lead on three of the album&#x27;s tracks—&quot;Femme Fatale&quot;, &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot;—and back-up on &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;. In 1966, as the album was being recorded, this was also the line-up for their live performances as a part of Warhol&#x27;s Exploding Plastic Inevitable.

The bulk of the songs that would become &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; were recorded in four days in mid-April 1966 at Scepter Studios, a recording studio in Manhattan. This was financed by Warhol and Columbia Records&#x27; sales executive Norman Dolph, who also acted as an engineer with John Licata. The cost of the project is unknown. Estimates vary from $1,500 (US$ in dollars) to $3,000 (US$ in dollars).

Soon after, Dolph sent an acetate disc of the recordings to Columbia Records in an attempt to interest them in distributing the album, but they declined, as did Atlantic Records and Elektra Records—according to Morrison, Atlantic objected to the references to drugs in Reed&#x27;s songs, while Elektra disliked Cale&#x27;s viola. Finally, the MGM Records-owned Verve Records accepted the recordings, with the help of Verve staff producer Tom Wilson who had recently moved from a job at Columbia.

With the backing of a label, one month later in May 1966 three of the songs, &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot;, &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; and &quot;Heroin&quot;, were re-recorded in two days at TTG Studios during a stay in Hollywood. When the record&#x27;s release date was postponed, Wilson brought the band into Mayfair Recording Studios in Manhattan in November 1966, to add a final song to the album: the single &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;.
==Production==
Although Andy Warhol is the only formally credited producer, he had little influence beyond paying for the recording sessions. Several others who worked on the album are often mentioned as the technical producer.

Norman Dolph and John Licata are sometimes attributed to producing the Scepter Studios sessions, as they were responsible for recording and engineering, though neither is credited. Dolph said Cale was the creative producer, as he handled the majority of the arrangements. However Cale recalled that Tom Wilson produced nearly all the tracks, and said that Warhol &quot;didn&#x27;t do anything&quot;. Reed also said the &quot;real producer&quot; of the album was Wilson. Reed claimed it was MGM who decided to bring in Wilson, and credited him for producing songs such as &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;: &quot;Andy absorbed all the flak. Then MGM said they wanted to bring in a real producer, Tom Wilson. So that&#x27;s how you got &#x27;Sunday Morning&#x27;, with all those overdubs—the viola in the back, Nico chanting. But he couldn&#x27;t undo what had already been done.&quot;

However Sterling Morrison and Lou Reed both cited Warhol&#x27;s lack of manipulation as a legitimate method of production. Morrison described Warhol as the producer &quot;in the sense of producing a film&quot;. Reed said:

&quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; was notable for its overt descriptions of topics such as drug abuse, prostitution, sadism and masochism and sexual deviancy. &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot; describes a protagonist&#x27;s efforts to obtain heroin, while &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; is a nearly literal interpretation of the 19th century novel of the same name (which itself prominently features accounts of BDSM). &quot;Heroin&quot; details an individual&#x27;s use of the drug and the experience of feeling its effects.

Lou Reed, who wrote the majority of the album&#x27;s lyrics, never intended to write about such topics for shock value. Reed, a fan of poets and authors such as Raymond Chandler, Nelson Algren, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Hubert Selby, Jr., saw no reason the content in their works could not translate well to rock and roll music. An English major who studied for a B.A. at Syracuse University, Reed said in an interview that he thought joining the two (gritty subject matter and music) was &quot;obvious&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s the kind of stuff you might read. Why wouldn&#x27;t you listen to it? You have the fun of reading that, and you get the fun of rock on top of it.&quot;

Though the album&#x27;s dark subject matter is today considered revolutionary, several of the album&#x27;s songs are centered on themes more typical of popular music. Certain songs were written by Reed as observations of the members of Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Factory superstars&quot;. &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; in particular was written about Edie Sedgwick at Warhol&#x27;s request. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot;, inspired by Nico, is a tender and affectionate song; in stark contrast to a song like &quot;Heroin&quot;. A common misperception is that &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; was written by Reed at Warhol&#x27;s request (as stated in Victor Bockris and Gerard Malanga&#x27;s Velvet Underground biography &quot;Up-Tight: The Velvet Underground Story&quot;). While the song does seem to be another observation of Factory denizens, Reed wrote the song before meeting Warhol, having recorded a demo in July 1965 at Ludlow Street. It had folk music sounds, which were possibly inspired by Bob Dylan.

===Instrumentation and performance===

&quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; has generally been described by writers as art rock, experimental rock, proto-punk, psychedelic rock, and avant-pop. Much of the album&#x27;s sound was conceived by John Cale, who stressed the experimental qualities of the band. He was influenced greatly by his work with minimalist composer La Monte Young, John Cage and the early Fluxus movement, and encouraged the use of alternative ways of producing sound in music. Cale thought his sensibilities meshed well with Lou Reed&#x27;s, who was already experimenting with alternate tunings. For instance, Reed had &quot;invented&quot; the ostrich guitar tuning for a song he wrote called &quot;The Ostrich&quot; for the short-lived band the Primitives. Ostrich guitar tuning consists of all strings being tuned to the same note. This method was utilized on the songs &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; and &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;. Often, the guitars were also tuned down a whole step, which produced a lower, fuller sound that Cale considered &quot;sexy&quot;.

Cale performed on the viola on several of the album&#x27;s songs, notably &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; and &quot;The Black Angel&#x27;s Death Song&quot;. The viola used guitar and mandolin strings, and when played loudly, Cale would liken its brash sound to that of an airplane engine. Cale&#x27;s technique usually involved minimalist drones, detuning for an eerie, surreal effect, and distortion to highlight harmonics and transform the instrument&#x27;s sound. According to Robert Christgau, the &quot;narcotic drone&quot; not only sustains the sadomasochism-themed &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;, but it also &quot;identifies and unifies the [album] musically&quot;. Of the vocal performances, he believed &quot;Nico&#x27;s contained sexuality&quot; complemented &quot;the dispassionate abandon of Reed&#x27;s chant singing&quot;. In 1966, Richard Goldstein described Nico&#x27;s vocal as &quot;something like a cello getting up in the morning&quot;.

Tucker&#x27;s style of drumming on the album involved her playing standing up rather than sitting down, playing bass drums and tambourines on their sides with a drumstick in her left hand and a mallet in her right hand, resulting in &quot;a mix of African trance rhythms and Ringo-like arrangement genius&quot; according to Adam Budofsky of &quot;Modern Drummer&quot;. The band&#x27;s initial percussionist and ex-member, Angus MacLise, had informed Tucker&#x27;s style and influenced her into playing &quot;pounding&quot; rhythms that fit with, in her words, &quot;the ominous mood&quot; of several of the album&#x27;s songs.

==Artwork==
The album cover for &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; is recognizable for featuring a Warhol print of a banana. Early copies of the album invited the owner to &quot;Peel slowly and see&quot;, and peeling back the banana skin revealed a flesh-colored banana underneath. A special machine was needed to manufacture these covers (one of the causes of the album&#x27;s delayed release), but MGM paid for costs figuring that any ties to Warhol would boost sales of the album. Most reissued vinyl editions of the album do not feature the peel-off sticker; original copies of the album with the peel-sticker feature are now rare collector&#x27;s items. A Japanese re-issue LP in the early 1980s was the only re-issue version to include the banana sticker for many years. On the 1996 CD reissue, the banana image is on the front cover while the image of the peeled banana is on the inside of the jewel case, beneath the CD itself. The album was re-pressed onto heavyweight vinyl in 2008, featuring a banana sticker. 

===Back cover lawsuit===
When the album was first issued, the main back cover photo (taken at a performance of Warhol&#x27;s event Exploding Plastic Inevitable) contained an image of actor Eric Emerson projected upside-down on the wall behind the band. Having recently been arrested for drug possession and desperate for money, Emerson threatened to sue over this unauthorized use of his image, unless he was paid. Rather than complying, MGM recalled copies of the album and halted its distribution until Emerson&#x27;s image could be airbrushed from the photo on subsequent pressings. Copies that had already been printed were sold with a large black sticker covering the actor&#x27;s image. 

===Front cover lawsuit===
In January 2012, the &quot;Velvet Underground&quot; business partnership (of which John Cale and Lou Reed were general partners) sued the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York after the Foundation licensed the cover&#x27;s banana design to Incase Designs for use on a line of iPhone and iPad cases. The complaint involved copyright infringement, trademark infringement and unfair competition. 

Alleging that the Foundation had earlier claimed it &quot;may&quot; own the design&#x27;s copyright, the partnership asked the court for a declaratory judgment that the Foundation did not have such rights. In response, the Foundation gave the partnership a &quot;Covenant Not to Sue&quot;—a written and binding promise that, even if the partnership and certain other parties continued to use the design commercially, the Foundation would never invoke its professed copyright ownership against them in court.

On the Foundation&#x27;s motion, Judge Alison J. Nathan severed and dismissed from the lawsuit the partnership&#x27;s copyright claim. According to Judge Nathan, the Constitution allows federal courts to decide only &quot;Cases&quot; or &quot;Controversies&quot;, which means ongoing or imminent disputes over legal rights, involving concrete facts and specific acts, that require court intervention in order to shield the plaintiff from harm or interference with its rights. The judge held that the partnership&#x27;s complaint fell short of that standard because even if the Foundation continued to claim ownership of the design&#x27;s copyright—and even if its claim was invalid—that claim would not legally harm the partnership or prevent it from making its own lawful uses of the design. The partnership did not claim that &quot;it&quot; owned the design&#x27;s copyright, only that the Foundation did &quot;not&quot;. Since, according to the court, the Foundation promised not to sue the partnership for any &quot;potentially copyright-infringing uses of the Banana Design&quot;, the partnership could continue using the design and there would be no legal action that the Foundation could take (under &quot;copyright&quot; law) to stop it. And if, the court concluded, the partnership could continue with business as usual (as far as &quot;copyright&quot; was concerned) regardless of whether the Foundation actually owned the design&#x27;s copyright, a court decision would have no practical consequences for the partnership; it would be a purely academic (or &quot;advisory&quot;) opinion, which federal courts may not issue. The court therefore &quot;dismissed without prejudice&quot; the partnership&#x27;s request that it resolve whether the Foundation owned the design&#x27;s copyright. The remaining trademark claims were settled out of court with a confidential agreement, and the partnership&#x27;s suit was dismissed in late May 2013.

==Reception and sales==
===Chart history and sales figures===
Upon release, &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; was a commercial flop. The album&#x27;s controversial content led to its almost instantaneous ban from various record stores, many radio stations refused to play it, and magazines refused to carry advertisements for it. Its lack of success can also be attributed to Verve, who failed to promote or distribute the album with anything but modest attention. However, Richie Unterberger of AllMusic also notes that:

The album first entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts on May 13, 1967, at number 199 and left the charts on June 10, 1967, at number 195. When Verve recalled the album in June due to Eric Emerson&#x27;s lawsuit, it disappeared from the charts for five months. It then re-entered the charts on November 18, 1967, at number 182, peaked at number 171 on December 16, 1967, and finally left the charts on January 6, 1968, at number 193.

The English musician Brian Eno said in 1982 that while the album only sold approximately 30,000 copies in its first five years, &quot;everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band&quot;. Writers often use this quotation as a definitive figure for how many copies of &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; were sold in the first several years. While it indeed sold less than Warhol and the band had hoped, according to a MGM royalty statement presented to Jeff Gold, a former Warner Bros. Records executive, 58,476 copies of the album sold through February 1969—a respectable figure for a late-1960s LP. Grant McPhee, a filmmaker and music writer, later conducted a 2021 investigation into Eno&#x27;s famous claim and concluded that it may have sold as many as 200,000 copies by 1971 alone.

===Contemporary reception===
A capsule review from &quot;Billboard&quot; published ahead of the album&#x27;s release praised the &quot;haunting&quot; vocals of Nico and the &quot;powerful&quot; lyrics of the band, calling it a collection of &quot;sophisticated folk-rock&quot; and a &quot;left-fielder which could click in a big way.&quot; &quot;Vibrations&quot;, a small rock music magazine, gave the album a mostly positive review in their second issue, describing the music as &quot;a full-fledged attack on the ears and on the brain&quot; while noting the dark lyrics. Wayne Harada of the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; and Dave Donelly of the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; both praised the album&#x27;s banana-sticker cover; the former terming it &quot;the wildest&quot; front cover of any album yet and the latter calling it a conversation piece. Harada wrote: &quot;Inside, the eating&#x27;s good, too: &#x27;Sunday Morning&#x27; has a definite psychedelic hit sound. &#x27;Run Run Run&#x27; still is another Underground gem gaining ground.&quot; Donelly called the album &quot;not Commercial with a capital &#x27;C&#x27; but an experience in sound.&quot; An anonymous reviewer in the &quot;American Record Guide&quot; praised Reed&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;penetratingly contemporary&quot;, comparing them to the work of Dylan while calling Reed on the basis of the record &quot;an important new (to me) talent&quot;. The reviewer also praised the variety in sounds presented by &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;European Son&quot;, and &quot;Heroin&quot; alongside from the more Dylan-esque songs.

Meanwhile, Richard Goldstein of the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, published in Velvet Underground&#x27;s hometown of New York City, was more reserved in his praise. Goldstein called &quot;There She Goes Again&quot; a &quot;blatant&quot; lift of the Rolling Stones rendition of &quot;Hitch Hike&quot; and called Reed&#x27;s vocal performances on other songs &quot;distressingly like early Dylan&quot;. However he ultimately wrote that &quot;the Velvets are an important group and this album has some major work [within]&quot;, singling out &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot;, &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;, &quot;Femme Fatale&quot;, and &quot;Heroin&quot;. Of the latter song, Goldstein wrote:
The &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; writer Vance Johnston dismissed it as a collection of &quot;several confusing sounds... most depressing and whatever the message I failed to get&quot; but wrote that Warhol aficionados would declare it his best &quot;at any rate&quot;. Don Lass of New Jersey&#x27;s &quot;Asbury Park Evening Press&quot; was similarly dismissive, finding the music &quot;as lifeless and inanimate as the discarded banana peel, touching every cliche in the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll spectrum while missing the genuine fun that good big-beat renderings can offer.&quot; A staff writer for the &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot; defined the album overall as &quot;one big savage sound&quot;, with its lyrics &quot;equally frenzied&quot;: &quot;The result sounds like the merger of Dracula and some of the long-haired wailers of today&quot;. John F. Szwed of &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; called the band&#x27;s performance on the record &quot;tedious despite their ventures into electric viola &quot;et al&quot;&quot;, acknowledging the strength of their &quot;loud whine&quot; but ultimately writing that &quot;something is lost in the translation&quot; in the absence of the visual accompaniments of &quot;Exploding Plastic Inevitable&quot;.

===Reappraisal===

A decade after its release, &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; began to attract wide praise from rock critics. Christgau wrote in his 1977 retrospective review for the &quot;Village Voice&quot; that the record had been difficult to understand in 1967, &quot;which is probably why people are still learning from it. It sounds intermittently crude, thin, and pretentious at first, but it never stops getting better.&quot; He later included it in his &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981).

In &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (1998), Colin Larkin called it a &quot;powerful collection&quot; that &quot;introduced Reed&#x27;s decidedly urban infatuations, a fascination for street culture and amorality bordering on voyeurism.&quot; In April 2003, &quot;Spin&quot; led their &quot;Top Fifteen Most Influential Albums of All Time&quot; list with the album. On November 12, 2000, NPR included it in their &quot;NPR 100&quot; series of &quot;the most important American musical works of the 20th century&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 13 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, calling it the &quot;most prophetic rock album ever made&quot;. It re-ranked at number 23 in a 2020 reboot of the list. The album was selected as one of the 24 significant US albums of the 1960s in the book &quot;The Perfect Collection&quot; by Tom Hibbert (1982).

In 1997, &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; was named the 22nd greatest album of all time in a &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll conducted in the United Kingdom by HMV Group, Channel 4, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Classic FM. In 2006, &quot;Q magazine&quot; readers voted it into 42nd place in the &quot;2006 Q Magazine Readers&#x27; 100 Greatest Albums Ever&quot; poll, while &quot;The Observer&quot; placed it at number 1 in a list of &quot;50 Albums That Changed Music&quot; in July of that year. Also in 2006, the album was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 best albums of all time. In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed the album at number 1 on its list of &quot;The 200 Best Albums of the 1960s&quot;. It was voted number 13 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; 3rd Edition (2000).

===Cover versions===
In April 1967, one month after the album&#x27;s release, a band called the Electrical Banana may have recorded the first cover version of &quot;There She Goes Again&quot;. According to bandmember Dean Kohler, they recorded it in a tent in Vietnam in April 1967 and sent the master tape to a company in California to have 45 RPM records pressed.

Also in 1967 the Dutch band The Riats from The Hague released a single with &quot;Run, Run, Run&quot; as the A-side and &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; as B-side. The exact release date is unknown, so it remains open for debate whether Electric Banana or The Riats were the first to put a Velvet Underground cover on record.

In 2009, the American musician Beck recorded a track-for-track cover of &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; and released it online in video form on his website, as part of a project called Record Club. Musicians involved in the recording include Beck plus Nigel Godrich, Joey Waronker, Brian LeBarton, Bram Inscore, Yo, Giovanni Ribisi, Chris Holmes, and Þórunn Magnúsdóttir.

Also in 2009, various artists from Argentina collaborated to produce a track-for-track cover of the record. They played a number of concerts in Buenos Aires to celebrate the release of the album, which was made available online for free.

In 2021, Verve Records released the tribute album &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror: A Tribute to The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;, a track-by-track cover of the album with performances by St. Vincent, Sharon Van Etten, Bobby Gillespie, and Iggy Pop among others.

==Aftermath==
Frustrated by the album&#x27;s year-long delay and unsuccessful release, Lou Reed&#x27;s relationship with Andy Warhol grew tense. Reed fired Warhol as manager in favor of Steve Sesnick, who convinced the group to move towards a more commercial direction. Nico was forced out of the group, and began a career as a solo artist. Her debut solo album, &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot;, was released in October 1967, featuring some songs written by Velvet Underground members.

Tom Wilson continued working with the Velvet Underground, producing their 1968 album &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; and Nico&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot;.

==Reissues and deluxe editions==
===Compact disc===
The first CD edition of the album was released in 1986 and featured slight changes. The title of the album was featured on the cover, unlike the original LP release. In addition, the album contained an alternate mix of &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; which featured a single track of lead vocals as opposed to the double-tracked vocal version on the original LP. Apparently, the decision to use the double-tracked version on the original LP was made at the last minute. Bill Levenson, who was overseeing the initial CD issues of the VU&#x27;s Verve/MGM catalog, wanted to keep the single-voice version a secret as a surprise to fans, but was dismayed to find out that the alternate version was revealed as such on the CD&#x27;s back cover (and noted as &quot;previously unreleased&quot;).

The subsequent 1996 remastered CD reissue removed these changes, keeping the original album art and double-tracked mix of &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; found on the LP.

===&quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot; box set===
&quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; was released in its entirety on the five-year spanning box set, &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot;, in 1995. The album was featured on the second disc of the set along with the single version of &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;, two Nico tracks from &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; and a ten-minute excerpt of the 45-minute &quot;Melody Laughter&quot; performance. Also included in the set (on the first disc) are the band&#x27;s 1965 Ludlow Street loft demos. Among these demos are early versions of &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;, &quot;Heroin&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot; and &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;.

===Deluxe edition===
In 2002, Universal released a two-disc &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; set containing the stereo version of the album along with the five tracks from Nico&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; written by members of the band on disc one, and the mono version of the album along with the mono single mixes of &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; and &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; and their B-sides &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot; and &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; on disc two. A studio demo of the unreleased track &quot;Miss Joanie Lee&quot; had been planned for inclusion on the set, but a dispute over royalties between the band and Universal canceled these plans. This contractual dispute apparently also led to the cancellation of further installments of the band&#x27;s official Bootleg Series. However, this track was included in the subsequent re-release, 45th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition. In April 2010, Universal re-released the second disc of the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; as a single CD &quot;Rarities Edition&quot;.


===45th Anniversary Super Deluxe edition===
On October 1, 2012, Universal released a 6-CD box set of the album. It features the previously available mono and stereo mixes as discs one and two respectively. Disc one contains as bonus tracks additional alternate versions of &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;, &quot;European Son&quot;, &quot;Heroin&quot;, &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; (alternate instrumental version), and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot;. Disc two contains the same bonus tracks as the prior deluxe version&#x27;s second disc. Disc three is Nico&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; in its entirety and the Scepter Studios acetate (see below) in its entirety occupies disc 4. Discs 5 and 6 contain a previously unreleased live performance from 1966. According to the essay by music critic and historian Richie Unterberger contained within the set, the source for the show is the only audio tape of acceptable quality recording during singer Nico&#x27;s tenure in the band. The essay also clarifies that the absence of any DVD materials in the box set is due to the fact that none of the band&#x27;s shows were filmed, in spite of their heavy reliance on multimedia visuals.


===Scepter Studios acetate version===

Norman Dolph&#x27;s original acetate recording of the Scepter Studios material contains several recordings that would make it onto the final album, though many are different mixes of those recordings and three are different takes entirely. The acetate was cut on April 25, 1966, shortly after the recording sessions. It resurfaced decades later when it was bought by collector Warren Hill of Montreal, Quebec, Canada in September 2002 at a flea market in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City for $0.75. Hill put the album up for auction on eBay in November. On December 8, 2006, a winning bid for $155,401 was placed, but not honored. The album was again placed for auction on eBay and was successfully sold on December 16, 2006, for $25,200.

Although ten songs were recorded during the Scepter sessions, only nine appear on the acetate cut. Dolph recalls &quot;There She Goes Again&quot; being the missing song (and, indeed, the version of &quot;There She Goes Again&quot; that appears on the final LP is attributed to the Scepter Studios session). In 2012, the acetate was officially released as disc 4 of the omnicomprehensive &quot;45th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition&quot; box set of the album (see above). The disc also includes six previously unreleased bonus tracks, recorded during the band&#x27;s rehearsals at The Factory on January 3, 1966. However, a ripped version of the acetate began circulating the internet in January 2007. Bootleg versions of the acetate tracks have also become available on vinyl and CD. The acetate was issued on vinyl in 2013 as a limited edition for Record Store Day. In 2014, it went back to auction.

<text>Abū Jaʿfar Hārūn ibn Muḥammad ar-Rāshīd (), or simply Hārūn ibn al-Mahdī (; or 766 – 24 March 809), famously known as Hārūn ar-Rāshīd (), was the fifth Abbasid caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate, reigning from September 786 until his death in March 809. His reign is traditionally regarded to be the beginning of the Islamic Golden Age. His epithet &quot;al-Rashid&quot; translates to &quot;the Orthodox&quot;, &quot;the Just&quot;, &quot;the Upright&quot;, or &quot;the Rightly-Guided&quot;.

Harun established the legendary library Bayt al-Hikma (&quot;House of Wisdom&quot;) in Baghdad in present-day Iraq, and during his rule Baghdad began to flourish as a world center of knowledge, culture and trade. During his rule, the family of Barmakids, which played a deciding role in establishing the Abbasid Caliphate, declined gradually. In 796, he moved his court and government to Raqqa in present-day Syria. Domestically, Harun pursued policies similar to those of his father Al-Mahdi. He released many of the Umayyads and &#x27;Alids his brother Al-Hadi had imprisoned and declared amnesty for all political groups of the Quraysh. Large scale hostilities broke out with Byzantium, and under his rule, the Abbasid Empire reached its peak.

A Frankish mission came to offer Harun friendship in 799. Harun sent various presents with the emissaries on their return to Charlemagne&#x27;s court, including a clock that Charlemagne and his retinue deemed to be a conjuration because of the sounds it emanated and the tricks it displayed every time an hour ticked. Portions of the fictional &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; are set in Harun&#x27;s court and some of its stories involve Harun himself. Harun&#x27;s life and court have been the subject of many other tales, both factual and fictitious.

==Early life==
Hārūn was born in Rey, then part of Jibal in the Abbasid Caliphate, in present-day Tehran Province, Iran. He was the son of al-Mahdi, the third Abbasid caliph (r. 775–785), and his wife al-Khayzuran, who was a woman of strong and independent personality who greatly influenced affairs of state in the reigns of her husband and sons. Growing up Harun studied history, geography, rhetoric, music, poetry, and economics. However, most of his time was dedicated to mastering hadith and the Quran. In addition, he underwent advanced physical education as a future mujahid, and as a result, he practiced swordplay, archery, and learned the art of war. His birth date is debated, with various sources giving dates from 763 to 766.

Before becoming a caliph, in 780 and again in 782, Hārūn had already nominally led campaigns against the caliphate&#x27;s traditional enemy, the Eastern Roman Empire, ruled by Empress Irene. The latter expedition was a huge undertaking, and even reached the Asian suburbs of Constantinople. According to the Muslim chronicler Al-Tabari, the Byzantines lost tens of thousands of soldiers, and Harun employed 20,000 mules to carry the riches back. Upon his return to the Abbasid realm, the cost of a sword fell to one dirham and the price of a horse to a single gold Byzantine dinar.

Harun&#x27;s raids against the Byzantines elevated his political image and once he returned, he was given the &quot;laqab&quot; &quot;al-Rashid&quot;, meaning &quot;the Rightly-Guided One&quot;. He was promoted to crown prince and given the responsibility of governing the empire&#x27;s western territories, from Syria to Azerbaijan.

Upon the death of his father in 785, Harun&#x27;s brother al-Hadi became caliph. However, al-Hadi&#x27;s reign was brief: a year and two months. Al-Hadi clashed with their mother over her great influence in court. The historian al-Tabari notes varying accounts of al-Hadi&#x27;s death, e.g. an abdominal ulcer or assassination prompted by his own mother.

==Caliphate==

On the night of al-Hadi&#x27;s death, al-Khayzuran quickly released Yahya ibn Khalid from prison and ordered him to pay the army&#x27;s wages, send the letters to the governors to pledge allegiance to al-Rashīd, and prepare him as caliph. They summoned the commanders of the army, Harthama ibn A&#x27;yan and Khuzayma ibn Khazim, and asked them to swear allegiance to Harun as caliph. Khuzayma reportedly gathered and armed 5,000 of his own followers, dragged the Ja&#x27;far ibn al-Hādī from his bed and forced him to publicly renounce his claims in favour of Hārūn. Hārūn became caliph in 786 when he was in his early twenties. At the time, he was tall, good looking, and slim but strongly built, with wavy hair and olive skin. On the day of accession, his son al-Ma&#x27;mun was born, and al-Amin some little time later: the latter was the son of Zubaida, a granddaughter of al-Mansur (founder of the city of Baghdad); so he took precedence over the former, whose mother was a Persian. Upon his accession, Harun led Friday prayers in Baghdad&#x27;s Great Mosque and then sat publicly as officials and the layman alike lined up to swear allegiance and declare their happiness at his ascent to Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin. He began his reign by appointing very able ministers, who carried on the work of the government so well that they greatly improved the condition of the people.

Under Hārūn al-Rashīd&#x27;s rule, Baghdad flourished into the most splendid city of its period. Tribute paid by many rulers to the caliph funded architecture, the arts and court luxuries.

In 796, Hārūn moved the entire court to Raqqa on the middle Euphrates, where he spent 12 years, most of his reign. He appointed the Hanafi jurist Muhammad al-Shaybani as qadi (judge), but dismissed him in 803. He visited Baghdad only once. Several reasons may have influenced the decision to move to Raqqa: its closeness to the Byzantine border, its excellent communication lines via the Euphrates to Baghdad and via the Balikh river to the north and via Palmyra to Damascus, rich agricultural land, and the strategic advantage over any rebellion which might arise in Syria and the middle Euphrates area. Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, in his anthology of poems, depicts the splendid life in his court. In Raqqa the Barmakids managed the fate of the empire, and both heirs, al-Amin and al-Ma&#x27;mun, grew up there. At some point the royal court relocated again to Al-Rayy, the capital city of Khorasan, where the famous philologist and leader of the Kufan school, Al-Kisa&#x27;i, accompanied the caliph with his entourage. When al-Kisa&#x27;i became ill while in Al-Rayy, it is said that Harun visited him daily. It seems al-Shaybani and al-Kisa&#x27;i both died there on the same day in 804.

For the administration of the whole empire, he fell back on his mentor and longtime associate Yahya bin Khalid bin Barmak. Rashid appointed him as his vizier with full executive powers, and, for seventeen years, Yahya and his sons served Rashid faithfully in whatever assignment he entrusted to them.

Harun made pilgrimages to Mecca by camel ( from Baghdad) several times, e.g., 793, 795, 797, 802 and last in 803. Tabari concludes his account of Harun&#x27;s reign with these words: &quot;It has been said that when Harun ar-Rashid died, there were nine hundred million odd (dirhams) in the state treasury.&quot;

According to Shia belief, Harun imprisoned and poisoned Musa ibn Ja&#x27;far, the 7th Imam, in Baghdad.

Under al-Rashid, each city had its own law enforcement, which besides keeping order was supposed to examine the public markets in order to ensure, for instance, that proper scales and measures were used; enforce the payment of debts; and clamp down on illegal activities such as gambling, usury, and sales of alcohol.

Harun was a great patron of art and learning, and is best known for the unsurpassed splendor of his court and lifestyle. Some of the stories, perhaps the earliest, of &quot;The Thousand and One Nights&quot; were inspired by the glittering Baghdad court. The character King Shahryar (whose wife, Scheherazade, tells the tales) may have been based on Harun himself.

=== Advisors ===

Hārūn was influenced by the will of his powerful mother in the governance of the empire until her death in 789; When he became caliph, Harun allowed her (Khayzuran) a free hand and, at times, restrained his own desires out of deference to her expressed wishes, and Khayzuran acted as an overseer of affairs, and Yahya deferred to her and acted on her advice. His vizier (chief minister) Yahya ibn Khalid, Yahya&#x27;s sons (especially Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya), and other Barmakids generally controlled the administration. The position of Persians in the Abbasid caliphal court reached its peak during al-Rashid&#x27;s reign.

The Barmakids were an Iranian family (from Balkh) that dated back to the Barmak, a hereditary Buddhist priest of Nava Vihara, who converted after the Islamic conquest of Balkh and became very powerful under al-Mahdi. Yahya had helped Hārūn to obtain the caliphate, and he and his sons were in high favor until 798, when the caliph threw them in prison and confiscated their land. Al-Tabari dates this event to 803 and lists various reasons for it: Yahya&#x27;s entering the Caliph&#x27;s presence without permission; Yahya&#x27;s opposition to Muhammad ibn al Layth, who later gained Harun&#x27;s favour; and Ja&#x27;far&#x27;s release of Yahya ibn Abdallah ibn Hasan, whom Harun had imprisoned.

The fall of the Barmakids is far more likely due to their behaving in a manner that Harun found disrespectful (such as entering his court unannounced) and making decisions in matters of state without first consulting him. Al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi succeeded Yahya the Barmakid as Harun&#x27;s chief minister.

=== Diplomacy ===

Both Einhard and Notker the Stammerer refer to envoys traveling between the courts of Harun and Charlemagne, king of the Franks, and entering friendly discussions about Christian access to holy sites and gift exchanges. Notker mentions Charlemagne sent Harun Spanish horses, colorful Frisian cloaks and impressive hunting dogs. In 802 Harun sent Charlemagne a present consisting of silks, brass candelabra, perfume, balsam, ivory chessmen, a colossal tent with many-colored curtains, an elephant named Abul-Abbas, and a water clock that marked the hours by dropping bronze balls into a bowl, as mechanical knights – one for each hour – emerged from little doors which shut behind them. The presents were unprecedented in Western Europe and may have influenced Carolingian art. This exchange of embassies was due to the fact that Harun was interested, like Charlemagne, in subduing the Umayyad emirs of Córdoba. Also, the common enmity against the Byzantines was what brought Harun closer to the contemporary Charlemagne.

When the Byzantine empress Irene was deposed in 802, Nikephoros I became emperor and refused to pay tribute to Harun, saying that Irene should have been receiving the tribute the whole time. News of this angered Harun, who wrote a message on the back of the Byzantine emperor&#x27;s letter and said, &quot;In the name of God the most merciful, From Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin Harun ar-Rashid, commander of the faithful, to Nikephoros, dog of the Romans. Thou shalt not hear, thou shalt behold my reply&quot;. After campaigns in Asia Minor, Nikephoros was forced to conclude a treaty, with humiliating terms. According to Dr Ahmad Mukhtar al-Abadi, it is due to the particularly fierce second retribution campaign against Nikephoros, that the Byzantine practically ceased any attempt to incite any conflict against the Abbasid again until the rule of Al-Ma&#x27;mun.

An alliance was established with the Chinese Tang dynasty by Ar-Rashid after he sent embassies to China. He was called &quot;A-lun&quot; in the Chinese Tang Annals. The alliance was aimed against the Tibetans.

When diplomats and messengers visited Harun in his palace, he was screened behind a curtain. No visitor or petitioner could speak first, interrupt, or oppose the caliph. They were expected to give their undivided attention to the caliph and calculate their responses with great care.

=== Rebellions ===

Because of the &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot; tales, Harun al-Rashid turned into a legendary figure obscuring his true historic personality. In fact, his reign initiated the political disintegration of the Abbasid caliphate. Syria was inhabited by tribes with Umayyad sympathies and remained the bitter enemy of the Abbasids, while Egypt witnessed uprisings against Abbasids due to maladministration and arbitrary taxation. The Umayyads had been established in Spain in 755, the Idrisids in Morocco in 788, and the &quot;Aghlabids&quot; in Ifriqiya (modern Tunisia) in 800. Besides, unrest flared up in Yemen, and the Kharijites rose in rebellion in Daylam, Kerman, Fars and Sistan. Revolts also broke out in Khorasan, and al-Rashid waged many campaigns against the Byzantines.

Al-Rashid appointed Ali bin Isa bin Mahan as the governor of Khorasan, who tried to bring to heel the princes and chieftains of the region, and to reimpose the full authority of the central government on them. This new policy met with fierce resistance and provoked numerous uprisings in the region.

== Family ==
Harun&#x27;s first wife was Zubaidah. She was the daughter of his paternal uncle, Ja&#x27;far and maternal aunt Salsal, sister of Al-Khayzuran. They married in 781–82, at the residence of Muhammad bin Sulayman in Baghdad. She had one son, Caliph Al-Amin. She died in 831. Another of his wives was Azizah, daughter of Ghitrif, brother of Al-Khayzuran. She had been formerly married to Sulayman ibn Abi Ja&#x27;far, who had divorced her. Another was Ghadir also known as Amat-al-Aziz, who had been formerly a concubine of his brother al-Hadi. She had one son Ali. She died in 789. Another wife was Umm Muhammad, the daughter of Salih al-Miskin and Umm Abdullah, the daughter of Isa bin Ali. They married in November–December 803 in Al-Raqqah. She had been formerly been married to Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi, who had repudiated her. Another wife married around the same year was Abbasa, daughter of Sulayman ibn Abi Ja&#x27;far. Another wife was Jurashiyyah al-Uthmanniyah. She was the daughter of Abdullah bin Muhammad, and had descended from Uthman, the third Caliph of the Rashidun.

Harun&#x27;s earliest known concubine was Hailanah. She had been a slave girl of Yahya ibn Khalid, the Barmakid. It was she who begged him, while he was yet a prince, to take her away from the elderly Yahya. Harun then approached Yahya, who presented him with the girl. She died three years later in 789–90, and Harun mourned her deeply. Another concubine was Dananir. She was a Barmakid, and had been formerly a slave girl of Yahya ibn Khalid. She had been educated at Medina and had studied instrumental and vocal music. Another concubine was Marajil. She was a Persian, and came from distant Badhaghis in Persia. She was one of the ten maids presented to Harun. She gave birth to Abdullah (future caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun) on the night of Harun&#x27;s accession to the throne, in September 786, in whose birth she died. Her son was then adopted by Zubaidah. Another concubine was Qasif, mother of Al-Qasim. He was Harun&#x27;s second son, born to a concubine mother. Harun&#x27;s eldest daughter Sukaynah was also born to her.

Another concubine was Maridah. Her father was Shabib. She was a Sogdian, and was born in Kufah. She was one of the ten maids presented to Harun by Zubaidah. She had five children. These were Abu Ishaq (future caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim), Abu Isma&#x27;il, Umm Habib, and two others whose names are unknown. She was Harun&#x27;s favourite concubine. Some other favourite concubines were, Dhat al-Khal, Sihr, and Diya. Diya died much to Harun&#x27;s sorrow. Dhat al-Khal also known as Khubth and Khunth, was a singer, belonging to a slave-dealer who was himself a freedman of Abbasah, the sister of Al-Rashid. She caught the fancy of Ibrahim al-Mausili, whose songs in praise of her soon reached Harun&#x27;s attention, who bought her for the enormous sum of 70,000 dinars. She was the mother of Harun&#x27;s son, Abu al-Abbas Muhammad. Sihr was mother of Harun&#x27;s daughters, Khadijah and Karib. Another concubine was Inan. Her father was Abdullah. She was born and brought up in the Yamamah in central Arabia. She was a singer and a poet, and had been a slave girl of Abu Khalid al-Natifi. She bore Harun two sons, both of whom died young. She accompanied him to Khurasan where he, and, soon after, she died.

Another concubine was Ghadid, also known as Musaffa, and she was mother of Harun&#x27;s daughters, Hamdunah and Fatimah. She was his favourite concubine. Hamdunah and Fatimah married Al-Hadi&#x27;s sons, Isma&#x27;il and Ja&#x27;far respectively. Another concubine was Shikl. She was the mother of Abu Ali. She was purchased by Al-Rashid along with another girl named Shadhr also known as Sukkar. When Shadhr became pregnant and had a child named Umm Abiha, Shikl grew envious of her. This jealousy escalated to the point where it became widely known. Later, Shikl herself became pregnant and gave birth to Abu Ali. Despite the deaths of both mothers, the animosity between Abu Ali and Umm Abiha persisted. Another concubine was Hilanah. She had been formerly a concubine of his brother al-Hadi.

Another of Harun&#x27;s concubines was the captive daughter of a Greek churchman of Heraclea acquired with the fall of that city in 806. Zubaidah once more presented him with one of her personal maids who had caught his fancy. Harun&#x27;s half-brother, while governor of Egypt from 795 to 797, also sent him an Egyptian maid who immediately won his favour. Some other concubines were namely: Ri&#x27;m, mother of Salih; Irbah, mother of Abu Isa Muhammad; Sahdhrah, mother of Abu Yaqub Muhammad; Rawah, mother of Abu Sulayman Muhammad; Dawaj, mother of Abu Ali Muhammad; Kitman, mother of Abu Ahmad Muhammad; Hulab, mother of Arwa; Irabah, mother of Umm al-Hassan; Rahiq, mother of Umm Salamah; Khzq, mother of Umm al-Qasim; Haly, mother of Umm Ja&#x27;far Ramlah; Aniq, mother of Umm Ali; Samandal, mother of Umm al-Ghaliyah; Zinah, mother of Raytah; Qaina; Shajw.

==Anecdotes ==
Many anecdotes attached themselves to the person of Harun al-Rashid in the centuries following his rule. Saadi of Shiraz inserted a number of them into his &quot;Gulistan&quot;.

Al-Masudi relates a number of interesting anecdotes in &quot;The Meadows of Gold&quot; that illuminate the caliph&#x27;s character. For example, he recounts Harun&#x27;s delight when his horse came in first, closely followed by al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s, at a race that Harun held at Raqqa. Al-Masudi tells the story of Harun setting his poets a challenging task. When others failed to please him, Miskin of Medina succeeded superbly well. The poet then launched into a moving account of how much it had cost him to learn that song. Harun laughed and said that he did not know which was more entertaining, the song or the story. He rewarded the poet.

There is also the tale of Harun asking Ishaq ibn Ibrahim to keep singing. The musician did so until the caliph fell asleep. Then, strangely, a handsome young man appeared, snatched the musician&#x27;s lute, sang a very moving piece (al-Masudi quotes it) and left. On awakening and being informed of that, Harun said Ishaq ibn Ibrahim had received a supernatural visitation.

Shortly before he died, Harun is said to have been reading some lines by Abu al-Atahiya about the transitory nature of the power and pleasures of this world, an anecdote related to other caliphs as well.

Every morning, Harun gave one thousand dirhams to charity and made one hundred prostrations a day. Harun famously used to look up at rain clouds in the sky and said: &quot;rain where you like, but I will get the land tax!&quot;

Harun was terrified for his soul in the afterlife. It was reported that he quickly cried when he thought of God and read poems about the briefness of life.

Soon after he became caliph, Harun asked his servant to bring him Ibn al-Sammak, a renowned scholar, to obtain wisdom from him. Harun asked al-Sammak what he would like to tell him. Al-Sammak replied, &quot;I would like you always to remember that one day you will stand alone before your God. You will then be consigned either to Heaven or to Hell.&quot; That was too harsh for Harun&#x27;s liking, and he was obviously disturbed. His servant cried out in protest that the Prince of the Faithful will definitely go to heaven after he has ruled justly on earth. However, al-Sammak ignored the interruption and looked straight into the eyes of Harun and said that &quot;you will not have this man to defend you on that day.&quot;

An official, Maan ibn Zaidah, had fallen out of favor with Harun. When Harun saw him in court, he said that &quot;you have grown old.&quot; The elderly man responded, &quot;Yes, O Commander of the Faithful in your service.&quot; Harun replied, &quot;But you have still some energy left.&quot; The old man replied that &quot;what I have, is yours to dispose of as you wish... and I am bold in opposing your foes.&quot; Harun was satisfied with the encounter and made the man governor of Basra for his final years.

On Hajj, he distributed large amounts of money to the people of Mecca and Medina and to poor pilgrims en route. He always took a number of ascetics with him, and whenever he was unable to go on pilgrimage, he sent dignitaries and three hundred clerics at his own expense.

One day, Harun was visiting a dignitary when he was struck by his beautiful slave. Harun asked the man to give her to him. The man obliged but was visibly disturbed by the loss. Afterward, Harun felt sorry for what he had done and gave her back.

Harun was an excellent horseman, enjoyed hunting (with Salukis, falcons, and hawks) and was fond of military exercises such as charging dummies with his sword. Harun was also the first Abbasid caliph to have played and promoted chess.

Harun desired a slave girl that was owned by an official named Isa who refused to give her to Harun, despite threats. Isa explained that he swore (in the middle of a sex act) that if he ever gave away or sold her, he would divorce his wife, free his slaves, and give all of his possessions to the impoverished. Yusuf, a judge and advisor to Harun, was called to arbitrate the case and to figure out a legal way for Isa to maintain his belongings even if Harun walked away with the girl. Yusuf decided that if Isa gave half of the girl to Harun and sold him the other half, it could not be said that Isa had either given her away or sold her, keeping his promise.

Harun had an anxious soul and supposedly was prone to walk the streets of Baghdad at night. At times Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya accompanied him. The night-time tours likely arose from a genuine and sympathetic concern in the well-being of his people, for it is said that he was assiduous to relieve any of their trials and tend to their needs.
== Death ==
A major revolt led by Rafi ibn al-Layth was started in Samarqand which forced Harun al-Rashid to move to Khorasan. He first removed and arrested Ali bin Isa bin Mahan but the revolt continued unchecked. (Harun had dismissed Ali and replaced him with Harthama ibn A&#x27;yan, and in 808 marched himself east to deal with the rebel Rafi ibn al-Layth, but died in March 809 while at Tus). Harun al-Rashid became ill and died very soon after when he reached Sanabad village in Tus and was buried in &quot;Dar al-Imarah&quot;, the summer palace of Humayd ibn Qahtaba, the Abbasid governor of Khorasan. Due to this historical event, the Dar al-Imarah was known as the Mausoleum of Haruniyyeh. The location later became known as Mashhad (&quot;The Place of Martyrdom&quot;) because of the martyrdom of Imam al-Ridha in 818. Harun al-Rashid and his first Heir, prince al-Amin (Al-Amin was nominated first heir, Al-Ma&#x27;mun second and Al-Qasim was third heir.) After Harun&#x27;s death in 809 he was succeeded by Al-Amin.

== Legacy ==
Al-Rashid become a prominent figure in the Islamic and Arab culture, he has been described as one of the most famous Arabs in history. All the Abbasid caliphs after him were his descendants.

About his accession famous poet and musician al-Mawsili said:

About his reign, famous Arab historian Al-Masudi said:
Al-Rashid become the progenitor of subsequent Abbasid caliphs. Al-Rashid nominated his son Muhammad al-Amin as his first heir. Muhammad had an elder half-brother, Abdallah, the future al-Ma&#x27;mun (), who had been born in September 786 (six months older than him) However, Abdallah&#x27;s mother was a Persian concubine, and his pure Abbasid lineage gave Muhammad seniority over his half-brother. Indeed, he was the only Abbasid caliph to claim such descent. Already in 792, Harun had Muhammad receive the oath of allegiance (&quot;bay&#x27;ah&quot;) with the name of &quot;al-Amīn&quot; (&quot;The Trustworthy&quot;), effectively marking him out as his main heir, while Abdallah was not named second heir, under the name &quot;al-Maʾmūn&quot; (&quot;The Trusted One&quot;) until 799. and his third son Qasim was nominated third heir, however he never became caliph.
Harun is sometimes accused of weakening the Abbasid legacy by dividing the kingdoms central powers between his two sons. This ultimately created tension between the two brothers. Among his sons, al-Amin became caliph after his death in 809. Al-Amin ruled from 809 to 813, until a civil war broke between him and his brother Abdallah al-Ma&#x27;mun (Governor of Khorasan). The reason of war were that caliph al-Amin tried to remove al-Ma&#x27;mun as his heir. Al-Ma&#x27;mun became caliph in 813 and ruled the caliphate for two decades until 833. He was succeeded by another of Harun&#x27;s son Abu Ishaq Muhammad (better known as Al-Mu&#x27;tasim), his mother was Marida, a concubine.

<doc id="78394" wikidata="Q188232" url="?curid=78394" title="Didymus the Blind">
<text>Didymus the Blind (alternatively spelled Dedimus or Didymous) (398) was a Christian theologian in the Church of Alexandria, where he taught for about half a century. He was a student of Origen, and, after the Second Council of Constantinople condemned Origen, Didymus&#x27;s works were not copied. Many of his writings are lost, but some of his commentaries and essays survive. He was seen as intelligent and a good teacher.

==Early life and education==
Didymus became blind at the age of four, before he had learned to read. He was a loyal follower of Origen, and opposed Arian and Macedonian teachings.

Despite his blindness, Didymus excelled in scholarship because of his incredible memory. He found ways to help blind people to read, experimenting with carved wooden letters similar to Braille systems used by the blind today. He recalled and contemplated information while others slept.

==Teacher in Alexandria==
According to Rufinus, Didymus was &quot;a teacher in the Church school&quot;, who was &quot;approved by Bishop Athanasius&quot; and other learned churchmen. Later scholars believed he was the head of the Catechetical School of Alexandria. However, the Catechetical School of Alexandria may not have existed in Didymus&#x27; time, and Rufinus may have been referring to a different school. Didymus remained a layman all his life and became one of the most learned ascetics of his time. He was the first Alexandrian Christian who made use of Hermetica as pagan prophecy of the coming of the Christ. Palladius, Rufinus, and Jerome were among his pupils.

Rufinus was Didymus&#x27;s pupil for eight years. When he translated Origen&#x27;s &quot;De principiis&quot; into Latin, he referenced Didymus&#x27;s commentary on it. Jerome mentions Didymus&#x27;s contributions to his ideas in the prefaces of many of his books, and called Didymus &quot;Didymus the Seer.&quot; Rufinus remained loyal to Didymus after Jerome condemned Didymus and Origen. Didymus was viewed as an orthodox Christian teacher and was greatly respected and admired up until at least 553. Socrates of Constantinople compared Didymus&#x27;s faithfulness to the Nicene Creed to Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus. In his position as a teacher, he held discussions and learned from Jews, pagans, Manichees, and other Christian teachers. Records of Didymus&#x27;s lectures and the questions students asked show that he taught the same educated pupils multiple times.

Several Oriental Orthodox Churches refer to him as Saint Didymus the Blind.

==Second Council of Constantinople==
In 553 the Second Council of Constantinople condemned his works, along with those of Origen and Evagrius, but not his person. In the Third Council of Constantinople in 680, and in the 787 Second Council of Nicaea, Didymus was again linked with and condemned with Origen. Many unconventional views became associated with Origen, and the 15 anathemas attributed to the council condemn a form of apocatastasis along with the pre-existence of the soul, animism (in this context, a heterodox Christology), and a denial of real and lasting resurrection of the body.

In spite of the condemnation of his works, he is still listed as &quot;St. Didymus the Blind&quot; in the Serbian Orthodox hagiography &quot;The Prologue of Ohrid&quot; which gives his feast date as October 18.

==Works==
As a result of his condemnation, many of his works were not copied during the Middle Ages and were subsequently lost. Of his lost compositions we can gather a partial list from the citations of ancient authors which includes &quot;On Dogmas, On The Death of Young Children, Against the Arians, First Word,&quot; and others. One of Didymus&#x27;s lost works is a commentary on Origen&#x27;s &quot;First Principles&quot; which, according to Jerome, tried to interpret an orthodox understanding of the Trinity from Origen&#x27;s theology. In it, he assumed the pre-existence of souls and Apocatastasis. He staunchly defended the doctrine of the Trinity. He argued that Christ&#x27;s body and soul were human, but that Christ was sinless.

Excerpts from Didymus&#x27;s Biblical commentary have been found in the Catena.

Modern knowledge of Didymus has been greatly increased by a group of 6th or 7th century papyrus codices discovered in 1941 at a munitions dump near Tura, Egypt (south of Cairo). These include his commentaries on Zechariah, Genesis 1–17, part of Job and parts (of uncertain authenticity) on Ecclesiastes and Psalms 20–46. In these commentaries, Didymus discusses long quotations from the Bible, and refrains from speculation, which he considered sophistry. However, he interprets scriptures allegorically, seeing symbols everywhere. For example, he wrote that the mountains in Zachariah represented the two Testaments of the Bible. Didymus saw an individual&#x27;s movement towards virtue as emerging from their interaction with scripture.

Didymus probably wrote the treatise &quot;On The Holy Spirit&quot; (written sometime before 381 in Greek), which was preserved in a Latin translation by Jerome. &quot;Commentary on the Catholic Epistles&quot; also is dubiously attributed to Didymus. The treatise &quot;Against the Manichees&quot; was also probably written by Didymus. There has been greater doubt over two further works traditionally attributed to Didymus. &quot;On The Trinity&quot;, identified in the eighteenth century as being Didymus&#x27; work, saw twentieth-century doubts, largely on grounds of lack of &#x27;provenance&#x27; and alleged inconsistencies with the commentaries discovered at Tura in 1941, but many would still see this as Didymus&#x27; work. Additionally, scholars do not believe that Didymus authored the work preserved as books 4 and 5 of Basil&#x27;s &quot;Against Eunomius&quot;.

Within the Commentary on Zechariah, Didymus shows himself to be a thoroughly intertextual reader of scripture. He moves from the text he is commenting on to a wide variety of other passages, quoting less frequently from the historical books which do not suit his allegorical method. Besides the gift of having a mind like a concordance, he also shows familiarity with philosophical terms and categories of the Stoics, Epicureans, and Pythagoreans (from whom, with Philo, he derives his occasional number symbolism hermeneutic). His works also seem to cite passages from the deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament as well as Barnabas, the Shepherd of Hermas and the Acts of John. According to Bart Ehrman, his canon extended to at least include Barnabas and the Shepherd. It has been suggested by R.M. Grant regarding Origen&#x27;s similarly expanded canon that while he lived in Alexandria he accepted the broader tradition of the church in Alexandria, but upon moving to Caesarea and finding the books were not accepted there henceforth manifested greater reserve towards them. Why Didymus would not have inherited his teachers later hesitation is unclear. Among his peers his hermeneutical method seems to have been met with mixed reactions. Jerome, who requested his commentary and considered him a mentor, is still baffled by Didymus&#x27;s use of what he considered apocryphal works. Readers such as Diodore in Antioch found his hermeneutical approach somewhat gratuitous and arbitrary. What none seem to deny, however, is that Didymus was unhindered by blindness in his remarkable ability to recall the sacred text.

A commentary attributed to Didymus that survives only in Latin suggests the epistle 2 Peter was forged, anticipating the beliefs of later scholars who would agree with the position that Peter was not the author of the letter. That said, it is doubtful that Didymus was the true author, as his other writings treat 2 Peter as canonical.

The no longer extant treatise &quot;On The Death of Young Children&quot; was addressed to Tyrannius Rufinus to answer his question &quot;Why do infants die?&quot;. According to Jerome, Didymus&#x27;s answer was that these infants &quot;had not sinned much [in the pre-existence], and therefore it was enough punishment for them just to have touched their bodily prisons&quot;.

==Thought==
Thoroughly Trinitarian, Didymus&#x27; makes God completely transcendent and only capable of being spoken of by images and apophatic means. He repeatedly emphasizes that God&#x27;s essence is beyond essence, and uses a term only seen otherwise in Cyril of Alexandria, &quot;without quantity.&quot; There can be seen in his works influence from the Cappadocian Fathers, focusing the concept of Hypostasis (philosophy) to express the independent reality of the three persons of the Trinity rather than beginning with the one divine substance (οὐσία) as his starting point. Within these three persons, the Father is the root of the Divinity, the Spirit proceeds from the Father, and the Son is generated. Didymus seemed very concerned with stressing the equality of the persons of the Trinity. In Georges Florovsky&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Didymus does not strive for precision in his formulations. This is a general feature of the school of Alexandria.&quot;

In combating the heresies of the Manichaean Docetists and Apollinarians, we should not be surprised to find Didymus insisting on the fullness of the human nature of Christ. He concludes there must be two natures united in Christ, not speculating on precisely how these work together but restricting himself to the expression &quot;a single Christ.&quot; In his atonement theory, Didymus does not mention deification, but rather focuses on the ransom and the restoration of the image and the likeness. The fragmentary nature of his writing at this point does not allow us to draw definite conclusions, but he does speak of &quot;universal salvation.&quot; Jerome, probably correctly, accused Didymus of confessing the ultimate restoration of the devil.

Didymus seems to have also accepted the pre-existence of souls, and considers the afterlife as a process of purification, though, according to Florovsky, he rejects metempsychosis. He describes the Day of the Lord as an internal illumination of the soul, and in the future world he believes that evil &quot;as a quality&quot; will no longer exist. For him, as in Clement and Origen, the &quot;true&quot; gnostics possess a divine philosophy, one which allows them to defend themselves against heretics by giving a clear confession of the faith. Throughout his theology the influence of Origen is revealed, various aspects of which, particularly his eschatology, must have led to the condemnation of his works.

<doc id="78397" wikidata="Q600094" url="?curid=78397" title="Paean">
<text>A paean () is a song or lyric poem expressing triumph or thanksgiving. In classical antiquity, it is usually performed by a chorus, but some examples seem intended for an individual voice (monody). It comes from the Greek (also or ), &quot;song of triumph, any solemn song or chant&quot;. &quot;Paeon&quot; was also the name of a divine physician and an epithet (&quot;byname&quot;) of Apollo.

==Etymology==
The basis of the word παιάν is .&quot; Its ultimate etymology is unclear. R. S. P. Beekes has suggested the meaning &quot;who heals illnesses through magic&quot;, from / &quot;blow&quot;, related to &quot;beat&quot; (from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*ph2u-ie/o-&quot;) or &quot;withhold&quot; (of uncertain etymology). He alternatively suggested that &quot;paian&quot; &quot;may well be Pre-Greek&quot;.

==Ancient Greek paean==
In Homer, Paeon was the Greek physician of the gods. In &quot;Iliad&quot; V he heals the wounded Ares and Hades with his herbal lore. In time Paeon (or Paean) became an epithet (&quot;byname&quot;) of Apollo as a god capable of bringing disease and propitiated as a god of healing. Hesiod identifies Paeon as a separate god, and in later poetry Paeon is invoked independently as a health god. Later, &quot;Paean&quot; becomes a byname of Asclepius, another healer-god.

The earliest appearances of a &quot;paean&quot; or hymn of thanksgiving also appear in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. After the prayer to avert evil from the Achaeans, a paean is sung. In an almost identical line (X.391) that suggests a formulaic expression, Achilles tells the Myrmidons to sing the paean after the death of Hector.

To discover the relation between Paean or Paeon, the healer-god, and paean in the sense of &quot;song&quot;, it is necessary to identify the connection between ritual chant and the shaman&#x27;s healing arts. 

Previously, L. R. Farnell had referred to the ancient association between the healing craft and the singing of spells, but found it impossible to decide which was the original sense. At all events the meaning of &quot;healer&quot; gradually gave place to that of &quot;hymn&quot;, from the phrase &quot; or &quot;.

Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods, like Dionysus, Helios, and Asclepius. About the 4th century the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. Its connection with Apollo as the slayer of the Python led to its association with battle and victory; hence it became the custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.

The Greek poet Aeschylus who took part in the Battle of Salamis, commented on the power of the paean over enemies (in this case the Persians):
 All the barbarians felt fear because they had been deprived of what they expected. The Greeks were singing the stately paean at that time not for flight, but because they were hastening into battle and were of heart.

A paean was sung before the resuming of the naval battle between the Corcyraeans and Corinthians in a war leading up to the Peloponnesian War, implying that it might have been a common practice. In addition, the paean is said to have been sung just before the start of various battles (including the Battle of Cunaxa) in Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; (or &quot;Persian Expedition&quot;).

==In Greek poetry and music==
The most famous paeans are those of Bacchylides and Pindar. Paeans were sung at the festivals of Apollo (especially the Hyacinthia), at banquets, and later even at public funerals. In later times they were addressed not only to the gods, but to human beings. In this manner the Rhodians celebrated Ptolemy I of Egypt, the Samians Lysander of Sparta, the Athenians Demetrius, the Delphians Craterus of Macedon.

Musically, the paean was a choral ode, and originally had an antiphonal character, in which a leader sang in a monodic style, with the chorus responding with a simple, informal phrase; however, later in its development, the paean was an entirely choral form. Typically the paean was in the Dorian mode (note that the Ancient Greek Dorian was different from the modern Dorian mode; see musical mode), and was accompanied by the kithara, which was Apollo&#x27;s instrument. Paeans meant to be sung on the battlefield were accompanied by aulos and kithara.

Two musical fragments of paeans survive from late antiquity: one by Athénaios Athenaíou&quot; (Athenaios son of Athenaios), the other by Limenius of Athens. The fragment by Limenius has been dated to 128 BC; the one by Athenaios may have been composed in the same year, or ten years earlier.

==Modern usage==
Paean is now usually used to mean an expression of praise or exultation (such as its coining in the redundant expression &quot;paeans of praise&quot;). A song called &quot;Paean&quot; was used in a Chinese propaganda film called &quot;The East Is Red&quot;. 
===USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; confession===
After being captured by North Korea in 1968, the commander of USS &quot;Pueblo&quot;, Lloyd M. Bucher, used &quot;paean&quot; (read &#x27;pee on&#x27;, i.e. urinate on) as a code that his confession was forced. Under threat of death, Bucher agreed to &quot;confess to his and the crew&#x27;s transgression&quot; in his own hand, and included the phrase &quot;We paean the DPRK [North Korea]. We paean their great leader Kim Il Sung&quot;.

<text>The flag of Suriname () was legally adopted on 25 November 1975, upon the independence of Suriname from the Netherlands.

The flag was designed as a result of a national competition. It was raised for the first time on the Independence Day of the Republic of Suriname. There is a legal requirement for vessels to raise the flag of Suriname when visiting another country to reduce miscommunication between other countries.

== Description ==
The flag of Suriname is composed of five horizontal bands of green (top, double width), white, red (quadruple width), white, and green (double width) with a large, yellow, five-pointed star in the center.

The color red represents progress, white represents freedom and justice and the green represents the fertility of the land. The yellow star represents unity and a golden future.


== Shapes and design ==
=== Flag of Suriname ===
The flag was designed as a result of a national competition, with the winning design being accepted by the Surinamese parliament in 1975. Jack Pinas, art teacher and graphic designer, won the design competition. However, some changes on Pinas&#x27; design were made.

The green horizontal band on both the top and bottom of the flag represents the richness of the country&#x27;s agricultural lands; the white horizontal band represents freedom and independence and red symbolizes progress and hope. The star on center of the flag reflects the sacrifices endured for the Surinamese independence as well as the unity of the country and a bright future. The Surinamese political parties are indicated by the different colors that are used in the flag.

=== Coat of arms ===
In 1770, the coat of arms belonged to the City of Amsterdam. However, in 1975, the year of Suriname&#x27;s independence, Suriname introduced a new coat of arms to acknowledge and respect the indigenous population as well as to represent the new country.

It consists of two Arawak Indians who represent the unity of the Indigenous people. The bright yellow star in the center symbolizes the people that migrated to Suriname including America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and Europe. The green diamond shape in the middle represents a hart.

The oval shape shield that is divided into two portrays a boat on the left side and rain forest on the right. The boat on the left side represent the history of slavery in Suriname and the people that were shipped from Africa. The right side of the shield, symbolizes justice. At the bottom shield there is a banner stating &#x27;JUSTITIA PIETAS FIDES&#x27;. Justitia means &#x27;justified&#x27;, Pietas means faithfulness towards God, family and country, and lastly, Fides means loyalty to commitment.

In 1682 the coat of Suriname still belonged to the Dutch West India Company, until Suriname established the &#x27;Society of Suriname&#x27; in 1683.

== Historical flags ==
=== Flag used in 1815–1959 ===
After the establishment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, the Dutch tricolor was used in the Dutch colony of Suriname. There was talk of a design for a colony flag with the Dutch tricolor with the coat of arms of Suriname in the white area, but in practice this was not used.

The governor&#x27;s flag before 1959 was the flag of the Netherlands with white circles in the top left corner. The same governor&#x27;s flag was also used by the governors of the Netherlands Antilles and Netherlands New Guinea respectively.

=== First flag, 1959–1975 ===
After the signing of the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands on 15 December 1954, the need arose for Suriname&#x27;s own official flag, coat of arms and anthem.

The pre-independence flag was designed by Noni Lichtveld and was adopted in 1959. It consisted of five coloured stars connected by a black ellipse with a plain white background. The coloured stars represented the major ethnic groups that comprise the Surinamese population, being black (Africans), brown (Asian Indians), yellow (Javanese and Chinese), red (Amerindians), and white (Europeans). The ellipse represented the harmonious relationship among the groups.

This flag was also used as the governor&#x27;s flag. However, the flag was criticized by the wider public for putting too much emphasis on the ethnic differences and therefore symbolizing less of the national unity of the Surinamese people. It was changed to the current flag in late 1975 after a nationwide contest.

<doc id="78401" wikidata="Q301219" url="?curid=78401" title="Erechtheus">
<text>Erechtheus (; ) in Greek mythology was a king of Athens, the founder of the &quot;polis&quot; and, in his role as god, attached to Poseidon, as &quot;Poseidon Erechtheus&quot;. The name Erichthonius is carried by a son of Erechtheus, but Plutarch conflated the two names in the myth of the begetting of Erechtheus.

== Erechtheus I ==
Athenians thought of themselves as &quot;Erechtheidai&quot;, the &quot;sons of Erechtheus&quot;. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; (2. 547–48) Erechtheus is the son of &quot;grain-giving Earth&quot;, reared by Athena. The earth-born son was sired by Hephaestus, whose semen Athena wiped from her thigh with a fillet of wool cast to earth, by which Gaia was made pregnant.

In the contest for patronage of Athens between Poseidon and Athena, the salt spring on the Acropolis where Poseidon&#x27;s trident struck was known as the &quot;sea of Erechtheus&quot;.

==Erechtheus II, king of Athens==

=== Family ===
The second Erechtheus was given a historicizing genealogy as son and heir to King Pandion I of Athens by Zeuxippe, this Pandion being son of Erichthonius. This later king Erechtheus may be distinguished as Erechtheus II. His siblings were Philomela, Procne, Butes and possibly Teuthras.

Erechtheus was father, by his wife Praxithea, of sons: Cecrops, Pandorus, Metion and of six daughters, the eldest was Protogeneia, Pandora, Procris, Creusa, Oreithyia and Chthonia. Sometimes, his other mentioned children were Orneus, Thespius, Eupalamus, Sicyon and Merope.

According to Pseudo-Apollodorus, Erechtheus II had a twin brother named Butes who married Erechtheus&#x27; daughter Chthonia, the &quot;earth-born&quot;. The brothers divided the royal power possessed by Pandion, Erechtheus taking the physical rule but Butes taking the priesthood of Athena and Poseidon, this right being passed on to his descendants. This late origin myth or &quot;aition&quot; justified and validated the descent of the hereditary priesthood of the Boutidai family.

===Reign===
His reign was marked by the war between Athens and Eleusis, when the Eleusinians were commanded by Eumolpus, coming from Thrace. An oracle declared that Athens&#x27; survival depended on the death of one of the three daughters of Erechtheus. Perhaps this means the three unmarried daughters. In one version it is Chthonia, the youngest, who is sacrificed. In another, it is both Protogeneia and Pandora, the two eldest, who offer themselves up. In any case the remaining sisters (excepting Orithyia who had been kidnapped by Boreas), or at least some of them, are said to kill themselves. The story of the unfortunate daughters of Erechtheus is comparable to those of the daughters of Hyacinthus of Lacedaemon, and of the daughters of Leos.

In the following battle between the forces of Athens and Eleusis, Erechtheus won the battle and slew Eumolpus, but then himself fell, struck down by Poseidon&#x27;s trident. According to fragments of Euripides&#x27; tragedy &quot;Erechtheus&quot;, Poseidon avenged his son Eumolpus&#x27; death by driving Erechtheus into the earth with blows of his trident,

The ending lines of Euripides&#x27; tragedy were recovered in 1965 from a papyrus fragment. They demonstrate for Burkert that &quot;the founding of the Erechtheum and the institution of the priestess of Athena coincide.&quot; Athena resolves the action by instructing Erichtheus&#x27; widow Praxithea:
...and for your husband I command a shrine to be constructed in the middle of the city; he will be known for him who killed him, under the name of &#x27;sacred Poseidon&#x27;; but among the citizens, when the sacrificial cattle are slaughtered, he shall also be called &#x27;Erechtheus&#x27;. To you, however, since you have rebuilt the city&#x27;s foundations, I grant the duty of bringing in the preliminary fire-sacrifices for the city, and to be called my priestess.&quot;

In the Athenian king-list, Xuthus, the son-in-law of Erechtheus, was asked to choose his successor from among his many sons and chose Cecrops II, named for the mythic founder-king Cecrops. Thus Erechtheus is succeeded by Cecrops II, his brother, according to a fragment from the poet Casto. But according to pseudo-Apollodorus he was succeeded by his son.


==Erechtheion==
The central gods of the Acropolis of Athens were &quot;Poseidon Erechtheus&quot; and &quot;Athena Polias&quot;, &quot;Athena patron-guardian of the city&quot;. The &quot;Odyssey&quot; (VII.81) already records that Athena returned to Athens and &quot;entered the strong-built house of Erechtheus&quot;. The archaic joint temple built upon the spot that was identified as the &quot;Kekropion&quot;, the hero-grave of the mythic founder-king Cecrops and the serpent that embodied his spirit was destroyed by the Persian forces in 480 BC, during the Greco-Persian wars, and was replaced between 421 and 407 BC by the present Erechtheum. Continuity of the site made sacred by the presence of Cecrops is inherent in the reference in Nonnus&#x27; &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; to the Erechtheion lamp as &quot;the lamp of Cecrops&quot;. Priests of the Erechtheum and the priestess of Athena jointly took part in the procession to Skiron that inaugurated the Skira festival near the end of the Athenian year. Their object was the &quot;temenos&quot; at Skiron of the hero-seer Skiros, who had aided Eumolpus in the war between Athens and Eleusis in which Erechtheus II, the hero-king, was both triumphant and died.

That Poseidon and Erechtheus were two names at Athens for the same figure (see below) was demonstrated in the cult at the Erechtheum, where there was a single altar, a single priest and sacrifices were dedicated to &quot;Poseidon Erechtheus&quot;, Walter Burkert observed, adding &quot;An historian would say that a Homeric, pan-Hellenic name has been superimposed on an autochthonous, non-Greek name.&quot;

==Swinburne&#x27;s Erechtheus==

Swinburne&#x27;s classical tragedy Erechtheus was published in 1876. He uses the framework of the classical myth to express the republican and patriotic ideals that preoccupied him at this era.

<text>Joannes Stobaeus (; ; 5th-century AD), from Stobi in Macedonia, was the compiler of a valuable series of extracts from Greek authors. The work was originally divided into two volumes containing two books each. The two volumes became separated in the manuscript tradition, and the first volume became known as the &quot;Extracts&quot; (also &quot;Eclogues&quot;) and the second volume became known as the &quot;Anthology&quot; (also &quot;Florilegium&quot;). Modern editions now refer to both volumes as the &quot;Anthology&quot;. The &quot;Anthology&quot; contains extracts from hundreds of writers, especially poets, historians, orators, philosophers and physicians. The subjects 
range from natural philosophy, dialectics, and ethics, to politics, economics, and maxims of practical wisdom. The work preserves fragments of many authors and works which otherwise might be unknown today.

==Life==
Nothing of his life is known. The age in which he lived cannot be fixed with accuracy. He quotes no writer later than the early 5th century, and he probably lived around this time. His surname apparently indicates that he was a native of Stobi capital of Macedonia Secundus, while his given name, John, would probably indicate that he was a Christian, or at least the son of Christian parents, However, from his silence in regard to Christian authors, it has also been inferred that he was not a Christian.

==Work==
Stobaeus&#x27; anthology is a collection of extracts from earlier Greek writers, which he collected and arranged, in the order of subjects, as a repertory of valuable and instructive sayings. The extracts were intended by Stobaeus for his son Septimius, and were preceded by a letter briefly explaining the purpose of the work and giving a summary of the contents. The full title, according to Photius, was &quot;Four Books of Extracts, Sayings and Precepts&quot; (Ἐκλογῶν, ἀποφθεγμάτων, ὑποθηκῶν βιβλία τέσσαρα [&quot;Eklogon, apophthegmaton, hypothekon biblia tessara&quot;]). He quoted more than five hundred writers, generally beginning with the poets, and then proceeding to the historians, orators, philosophers, and physicians. The works of the greater part of these have perished. It is to him that we owe many of our most important fragments of the dramatists. He has quoted over 500 passages from Euripides, 150 from Sophocles, and over 200 from Menander. It is evident from this summary, preserved in Photius&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; (9th century), that the work was originally divided into four books and two volumes, and that surviving manuscripts of the third book consist of two books which have been merged.

At some time subsequent to Photius the two volumes were separated, and the two volumes became known to Latin Europe as the &quot;Eclogae&quot; and the &quot;Florilegium&quot; respectively. Modern editions have dropped these two titles and have reverted to calling the entire work the &quot;Anthology&quot; (). In most of the manuscripts there is a division into three books, forming two distinct works; the first and second books forming one work under the title &quot;Physical and Moral Extracts&quot; (also &quot;Eclogues&quot;; Greek: ), the third book forming another work, called &quot;Florilegium&quot; or &quot;Sermones&quot; (or &quot;Anthology&quot;; ). The introduction to the whole work, treating of the value of philosophy and of philosophical sects, is lost, with the exception of the concluding portion; the second book is little more than a fragment, and the third and fourth have been amalgamated by altering the original sections. Each chapter of the four books is headed by a title describing its matter.

===Introduction===
We learn from Photius that the first book was preceded by a dissertation on the advantages of philosophy, an account of the different schools of philosophy, and a collection of the opinions of ancient writers on geometry, music, and arithmetic. The greater part of this introduction is lost. The close of it only, where arithmetic is spoken of, is still extant.

===&quot;Eclogues&quot;===
The first two books consist for the most part of extracts conveying the views of earlier poets and prose writers on points of physics, dialectics, and ethics. The first book was divided into sixty chapters, the second into forty-six, of which the manuscripts preserve only the first nine. Some of the missing parts of the second book (chapters 15, 31, 33, and 46) have, however, been recovered from a 14th-century .

His knowledge of physics — in the wide sense which the Greeks assigned to this term — is often untrustworthy. Stobaeus betrays a tendency to confound the dogmas of the early Ionian philosophers, and he occasionally mixes up Platonism with Pythagoreanism. For part of the first book and much of the second, it is clear that he depended on the (lost) works of the Peripatetic philosopher Aetius and the Stoic philosopher Arius Didymus.

===&quot;Florilegium&quot;===
The third and fourth books are an anthology devoted to subjects of a moral, political, and economic kind, and maxims of practical wisdom. The third book originally consisted of forty-two chapters, and the fourth of fifty-eight. These two books, like the larger part of the second, treat of ethics; the third, of virtues and vices, in pairs; the fourth, of more general ethical and political subjects, frequently citing extracts to illustrate the pros and cons of a question in two successive chapters.

==Editions==
The first edition of books 1 and 2 was that by G. Canter (Antwerp, 1575). There were subsequent editions made by A. H. L. Heeren (Göttingen, 1792–1801, in 4 vols. 8vo.), and Thomas Gaisford (Oxford, 1850). The first edition of books 3 and 4 was that edited by Trincavelli (Venice, 4to. 1536). Three editions were published by Conrad Gessner (Zurich, 1543; Basle, 1549; Zurich; 1559), and another by Gaisford (Oxford, 1822, 4 vols. 8vo.). The first edition of the whole of Stobaeus together was one published at Geneva in 1609. The next major edition of the whole corpus was that by Augustus Meineke (Leipzig, 1855–1864). The modern edition is that by Curt Wachsmuth and Otto Hense (Berlin, 1884–1912, 5 volumes). Wachsmuth and Hense&#x27;s edition attempts, as far as possible, to restore the text of the &quot;Anthology&quot; as it was written by Stobaeus.

The entire work has not been translated into any modern language. However, many of the individual authors have been collected and translated separately as part of collections of those authors&#x27; fragments.

<doc id="78404" wikidata="Q518265" url="?curid=78404" title="Aglaurus">
<text>Aglaurus (; ) or Agraulus (; ) is a name attributed to three figures in Greek mythology.

*Aglaurus, the daughter of Actaeus, the first king of Attica. She married Cecrops and according to Apollodorus became the mother of Erysichthon, Agraulus, Herse, and Pandrosus; other authors, however, including Pausanias and Hyginus, state that the eldest daughter of the couple is &quot;Aglaurus&quot; (see next entry), not &quot;Agraulus&quot;.
*Aglaurus, the daughter of Cecrops and the above Aglaurus, who was driven to suicide for ignoring a warning from the goddess Athena.
*Aglaurus, daughter of an incestuous relationship between Erectheus and his daughter Procris. Aglaurus is also known as Aglauros (most commonly), Aglaulos, Agraulus, Agravlos, or Agraulos. &quot;Agraulos&quot; (&quot;countryside flute&quot;) was probably the original form of the name, with the &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot; commonly switched to produce the prevalent &quot;Aglauros&quot; form.

<doc id="78411" wikidata="Q105643" url="?curid=78411" title="Flag of Tuvalu">
<text>The national flag of Tuvalu was instated when the country became independent in 1978, after the separation from the Gilbert and Ellice Islands in 1976.

==Features==
Like many former and current British dependencies, the Tuvaluan flag is a blue ensign based on the Union Flag, which is shown in the canton of the flag; but has a sky blue field rather than the conventional navy blue. The previous flag (with the Gilberts) was also based on the Union Flag but with the coat of arms created by Sir Arthur Grimble in 1932, the resident commissioner of the British colony.

The stars represent the nine islands which compose Tuvalu; the arrangement is geographically correct, with the east towards the top (i.e. north to the left).

The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesian people. The islands came within the British Empire&#x27;s sphere of influence in the late 19th century. The Ellice Islands were administered by Britain as part of a protectorate from 1892 to 1916 and as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony from 1916 to 1974. In 1974 the Ellice Islanders voted for separate British dependency status as Tuvalu, separating from the Gilbert Islands which became Kiribati upon independence. Tuvalu became a fully independent Commonwealth realm in 1978.

==Changes and controversies==

The name &quot;Tuvalu&quot; means &quot;eight together&quot;, referring to the eight islands which were originally inhabited. In October 1995 one of the stars on the flag was removed to conform with the country&#x27;s name. By January 1996 the flag was replaced with a new one which was not based on the British flag, but the eight stars were retained. This flag, however, was not liked by the inhabitants, who felt that it was a move towards replacing the popular Tuvaluan monarchy with a republic. In one incident, the people of Niutao, one of Tuvalu&#x27;s nine atolls, chopped down the flagpole as soon as the new flag was raised. The old flag was reinstated in 1997, with all nine stars being restored. Population pressures have since resulted in the ninth island being settled.

<doc id="78413" wikidata="Q633120" url="?curid=78413" title="Pandrosus">
<text>Pandrosos or Pandrosus (Ancient Greek: Πάνδροσος) was known in Greek myth as one of the three daughters of Cecrops I, the first king of Athens, and Aglaurus, daughter of King Actaeus.

== Family ==
Pandrosus&#x27; two sisters were Aglauros and Herse, and the three of them together are often referred to collectively as the Kekropidai after their father. Their brother was called Erysichthon who died without producing an heir to the throne. In one account, Pandrosus was by Hermes the mother of Ceryx rather than her sister Agraulus.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Pandrosos&quot; carries the meaning of &quot;all dew&quot; or &quot;all bedewed&quot; in the Greek language (drosos, dew). For this reason, Pandrosos is at times called the &quot;Dew Goddess&quot; and the three Kekropidai together are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Dew Sisters.&quot;

The name &quot;Herse&quot; also holds connotations of dew in the Greek. This has led to speculation among scholars that originally there were only two Kekropidai and that Herse was a later addition to the myth, functioning essentially as a double of Pandrosos. The purpose of the creation of the character of Herse would have been to bring the number of Kekropidai up to three so as to conform to the common trope of three sisters in Greek mythology (in keeping with the Three Fates, the Three Charites, etc.).

==Mythology==

Kekrops is thought to have been born from the soil of Athens itself, and possesses the head and torso of a man and the lower body of a snake. Beyond his status as Athens’ first king, he is known for judging the contest between Poseidon and Athena that decided the naming and patronage of the city. However, following his death, Kekrops is not succeeded by his son, but rather by Erechtheus (also known by the name Erichthonios), the child of Hephaestus and Gaia.

As told by the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, the god Hephaestus, in a fit of passion, attempts to rape the virgin goddess Athena, but is unsuccessful. In vain pursuit, he ejaculates on the Acropolis, and his seed fertilizes the soil there, impregnating Gaia and leading to the birth of Erechtheus. After Erechtheus is born, Athena takes the baby into her care and places him into a chest (or, in some versions of the story, a basket). She entrusts the chest to the Kekropidai, warning them never to look inside.

While Pandrosos faithfully follows Athena&#x27;s instructions, Aglauros and Herse are compelled by curiosity to open the chest, provoking Athena&#x27;s wrath. The two disobedient sisters are driven mad when they see the contents of the chest (in some versions of the myth, they see Erechtheus being guarded by a giant snake; in others, they see Erechtheus himself in the form of a snake), and hurl themselves off of the northern slope of the Acropolis, falling to their deaths. As the dutiful sister, Pandrosos is spared her sisters’ unfortunate fates.

There are several other versions of the myth of the Kekropidai. They generally disagree with one another on the topic of which of the sisters carries the blame for opening the chest. In one version, all three sisters are equally culpable, and Pandrosos succumbs to the temptation to look inside the chest along with her sisters. Another version of the myth holds Aglauros and Pandrosos as blameworthy, with Herse taking on the role of Pandrosos as the innocent sister. Yet another version tells the tale that Aglauros alone opened the chest, and that Pandrosos and Herse were spared Athena&#x27;s wrath for dutifully following the goddess’ instructions.

==Cult and worship==
===Arrephoria===
The Arrephoria was a night festival that took place during the Greek month of Skiraphorion at the height of summer in the honor of Athena and Aphrodite. The myth of the Kekropidai was inherently connected to the festival and could be taken as a mythic paradigm for a yearly ritual that was carried out by the Arrephoroi during this time. The Arrephoroi consisted of two young girls selected from Athens&#x27; aristocratic families by the Archon Basileus (king archon/magistrate). After being selected, these girls would live in a home on the Acropolis for the duration of a year in order to serve Athena; the end of their period of service would culminate in the Arrephoria where they would perform the initiation ritual that would signify their passage into the next stage of their lives.

According to a description given by Pausanias, the Greek geographer:

For a certain time the Arrephoroi have their living from the Goddess: and when the festival comes round they have to perform certain ceremonies during the night. They carry on their heads what Athena’s priestess gives them to carry, and neither she who gives it nor they who carry it know what it is she gives them. In the city not far from Aphrodite-in-the-Gardens is an enclosed place with a natural entrance to an underground descent; this is where the virgin girls go down. They leave down there what they were carrying, and take another thing and bring it back covered up. They are then sent away, and other virgin girls are brought to the Acropolis instead of them.&quot;
In this context, the myth of the Kekropidai served as a warning for the consequences of disobedience to the Arrephoroi who were forbidden to look into the chests that they were given to carry on their heads. Pandrosos, as the obedient daughter who obeyed Athena&#x27;s commands, served as a role model for the Arrephoroi who were expected to follow her example when carrying the ritual objects to the sanctuary of Aphrodite. It has been suggested in scholarship that Pandrosos’ obedience was acknowledged in the form of sacrifices; according to an old Attic law, whenever the sacrifice of a cow was made to Athena, it was necessary to sacrifice a ewe to Pandrosos as well, even outside of the time of the Arrephoria.

The two disobedient daughters, Aglauros and Herse, were also acknowledged during the Arrephoria. It is generally accepted that the Arrephoroi themselves represented the two unfaithful Kekropidai. The nighttime descent of the Arrephoroi could be taken as a symbolic reenactment of the scene in which Aglauros and Herse fling themselves from the Acropolis after viewing the contents of the chest that Athena gave to them.

===Pandroseion===
The Pandroseion was a sanctuary dedicated to Pandrosos located on the north side of the Acropolis, just to the west of the Erechtheion, a sanctuary dedicated to Erechtheus. It was an open-air precinct built in the shape of a quadrilateral, and its principal feature was Athena&#x27;s sacred olive tree. In the shade of the olive tree stood an altar to Zeus Herkeios (Zeus of the Court). The southeast corner A door in the lower storey of the western wall of the Erechtheion provided direct access between the Pandroseion and the Erechtheion&#x27;s interior; yet another doorway also connected the Pandroseion to the north porch of the Erechtheion. In this manner, the Pandroseion could be considered an appendage of the larger Erechtheion—perhaps fittingly considering the manner in which the myth surrounding Pandrosos intertwines with the tale of the birth of Erechtheus.

<text>Alastor (; Ancient Greek: Ἀλάστωρ, English translation: &quot;avenger&quot;) refers to a number of people and concepts in Greek mythology:

*Alastor, an epithet of the Greek God Zeus, according to Hesychius of Alexandria and the &quot;Etymologicum Magnum&quot;, which described him as the avenger of evil deeds, specifically familial bloodshed. As the personification of a curse, it was also a sidekick of the Erinyes. The name is also used, especially by the tragic writers, to designate any deity or demon who avenges wrongs committed by men. In Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Electra&quot;, Orestes questions an oracle who calls upon him to kill his mother, and wonders if the oracle was not from Apollo, but some malicious &quot;alastor&quot;. There was an altar to Zeus Alastor just outside the city walls of Thasos.
**By the time of the 4th century BC, &quot;alastor&quot; in Greek had degraded to a generic type of insult, with the approximate meaning of &quot;scoundrel&quot;.
*Alastor, a prince of Pylos and son of King Neleus and Chloris, daughter of Amphion. He was the brother of Asterius, Deimachus, Epilaus, Eurybius, Eurymenes, Evagoras, Nestor, Periclymenus, Phrasius, Pylaon, Taurus and Pero. When Heracles took Pylos, he killed Alastor and his brothers, except for Nestor. According to Parthenius of Nicaea, he was to be married to Harpalyce, who, however, was taken from him by her father Clymenus.
*Alastor, a Lycian warrior who was a companion of Sarpedon. He fought in the Trojan War and was slain by the Greek hero Odysseus during the battle.
**&quot;Alastorides&quot; is a patronymic form given by Homer to Tros, who was probably a son of the Lycian Alastor mentioned above.
*Alastor, a Pylian soldier who fought under their leader Nestor during the Trojan War. He remembered for having, together with Mecisteus, carried the wounded Teucer off the battlefield as they later did also with Hypsenor.
*Alastor, a black horse belonging to the Greek God Hades. He was one of the four horses drawing Hades&#x27;s chariot when he rose from the Underworld to bring Persephone down with him. The other three were Orphnaeus, Aethon, and Nycteus.
*Alastor, in Christian demonology, came to be considered a kind of possessing entity. He was likened to Nemesis. The name Alastor was also used as a generic term for a class of evil spirits.

<text>Neleus (; ) was a mythological king of Pylos. In some accounts, he was also counted as an Argonaut instead of his son, Nestor.

== Family ==
Neleus was the son of Poseidon and Tyro, and brother of Pelias. According to Pausanias, Neleus was the son of Cretheus, King of Iolcus, who was himself a son of Aeolus.

With Chloris, Neleus was the father of Pero, Periclymenus, Alastor, Chomius, Asterius, Deimachus, Epilaus, Eurybius, Eurymenes, Evagoras, Phrasius, Pylaon, Taurus and Nestor. Some say that Chloris was mother only of three of Neleus&#x27; sons (Nestor, Periclymenus and Chromius), whereas the rest were his children by different women, but other accounts explicitly disagree with the statement. Otherwise, the mother of Nestor was called Polymede.

== Mythology ==
Tyro was married to Cretheus (with whom she had three sons, Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon), though she loved Enipeus, a river god. She pursued Enipeus, who refused her advances. One day, Poseidon, filled with lust for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus. From their union were born Pelias and Neleus, twin boys. Tyro exposed her sons on a mountain, but they were found and raised by a maid.

When they reached adulthood, Pelias and Neleus found their mother Tyro and then killed her stepmother, Sidero, for having mistreated her. Sidero tried to hide in a temple to Hera but Pelias killed her anyway, earning himself Hera&#x27;s undying hatred. Neleus and Pelias then fought for the crown, and Neleus was banished to Messenia. There he was welcomed by his cousin Aphareus who gave him the maritime part of the land where he settled and established his palace. Neleus eventually became King of Pylos.

Heracles later asked Neleus to cleanse him of the blood-debt he gained by killing his own wife and children, but was refused. In retaliation, he killed Neleus and his sons, except for Nestor.

<text>Hiero I (; also Hieron ; ) was the son of Deinomenes, the brother of Gelon and tyrant of Syracuse in Sicily, from 478 to 467 BC. In succeeding Gelon, he conspired against a third brother, Polyzelos.

==Life==

During his reign, he greatly increased the power of Syracuse. He removed the inhabitants of Naxos and Catania to Leontini, peopled Catania (which he renamed Aetna) with Dorians, concluded an alliance with Theron, the tyrant of Acragas (Agrigentum), and espoused the cause of the Locrians against Anaxilas, tyrant of Rhegium.

His most important military achievement was the defeat of the Etruscans at the Battle of Cumae (474 BC), by which he saved the Greeks of Campania from Etruscan domination. A bronze helmet (now in the British Museum), with an inscription commemorating the event, was dedicated at Olympia.

Hiero&#x27;s reign was marked by the creation of what is believed to be the first secret police in Greek history, yet he was a liberal patron of literature and culture. The poets Simonides, Pindar, Bacchylides, Aeschylus, and Epicharmus were active at his court, as well the philosopher Xenophanes. He was an active participant in pan-hellenic athletic contests, winning several victories in the single horse race and also in the chariot race. He won the chariot race at Delphi in 470 BC (a victory celebrated in Pindar&#x27;s first Pythian ode) and at Olympia in 468 BC (this, his greatest victory, was commemorated in Bacchylides&#x27; third victory ode). Other odes dedicated to him include Pindar&#x27;s first Olympian Ode, his second and third Pythian odes, and Bacchylides&#x27; fourth and fifth victory odes.

He died at Catania/Aetna in 467 BC and was buried there, but his grave was later destroyed when the former inhabitants of Catania returned to the city. The tyranny at Syracuse lasted only a year or so after his death.

<text>Zenobius () was a Greek sophist, who taught rhetoric at Rome during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (AD 117–138).

==Biography==
He was the author of a collection of proverbs in three books, still extant in an abridged form, compiled, according to the &quot;Suda&quot;, from Didymus of Alexandria and &quot;The Tarrhaean&quot; (Lucillus of Tarrha, a polis in Crete). In the work, the proverbs are alphabetised and grouped by hundreds. This collection was first printed by Filippo Giunti in Florence, 1497.

Zenobius is also said to have been the author of a Greek translation of the Latin prose author Sallust, which has been lost, and of a birthday poem on the emperor Hadrian.

<text>Raise the Red Lantern is a 1991 Chinese period drama film directed by Zhang Yimou and starring Gong Li. It is an adaptation by of the 1990 novella &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; (originally &quot;Wives and Concubines&quot;) by Su Tong. The film was later adapted into a ballet of the same title by the National Ballet of China, also directed by Zhang. Set during the Warlord Era in the 1920s, the film tells the story of a young woman who becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy man. It was the third of eight collaborations between Zhang and Gong, following &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; in 1987 and &quot;Ju Dou&quot; in 1990. The film was shot in the Qiao Family Compound near the ancient city of Pingyao, in Shanxi Province.

&quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; received widespread critical acclaim. It was entered into the 48th Venice International Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Golden Lion and won the Silver Lion. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and won the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. It is considered an important work in the so-called Fifth Generation movement of Chinese cinema and is one of the most internationally highly-regarded films from mainland China overall; it appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27;s list of the 1000 best films ever made in 2004 and on the BBC&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest foreign language films in 2018.

==Plot==
The film is set in Republican China during the 1920s. Nineteen-year-old Songlian (Gong Li), an educated woman whose father has recently died and left the family bankrupt, is forced by her stepmother to marry into the wealthy Chen family, becoming the fourth wife or, as she is referred to, the Fourth Mistress (Sì Tàitai) of the household. Arriving at the palatial abode, she is at first treated like royalty, receiving sensuous foot massages and brightly lit red lanterns, as well as a visit from her husband, Master Chen (Ma Jingwu), the master of the house, whose face is never clearly shown.

Songlian soon discovers, however, that not all the wives in the household receive the same luxurious treatment. In fact, the master decides on a daily basis which wife he will spend the night with; whomever he chooses gets her lanterns lit, receives the foot massage, gets her choice of menu items at mealtime, and gets the most attention and respect from the servants. Pitted in constant competition against each other, these other three wives were continually vying for their husband&#x27;s attention.

The First Mistress, Yuru (Jin Shuyuan), appears to be nearly as old as the master himself. Having borne a son decades earlier, she seems resigned to living out her life as forgotten, always passed over in favor of the younger women. The Second Mistress, Zhuoyun (Zhuóyún, Cao Cuifen), befriends Songlian, complimenting her youth and beauty, and giving her expensive silk as a gift; she also warns her about the Third Mistress, Meishan (Méishan, He Saifei), a former opera singer who is spoiled and unable to cope with no longer being the youngest and most favored of the master&#x27;s playthings. As time passes, though, Songlian learns that it is really Zhuoyun, the Second Mistress, who is not to be trusted; she is subsequently described as having the face of the Buddha but possessing the heart of a scorpion. She also has to deal with her personal maid, Yan&#x27;er (Yàn&#x27;ér, played by Kong Lin), who hates her and dreams of being married after a few brief flings with the Master.

Songlian feigns pregnancy, attempting to garner the majority of the master&#x27;s time and, at the same time, attempting to become actually pregnant. Zhuoyun, however, is in league with Yan&#x27;er who finds and reveals a pair of bloodied undergarments, suggesting that Songlian had recently had her period, and discovers the pregnancy is a fraud.

Zhuoyun summons the family physician, feigning concern for Songlian&#x27;s &quot;pregnancy&quot;. Doctor Gao (Gao-yisheng, Cui Zhigang), who is secretly having an illicit affair with Third Mistress Meishan, examines Songlian and determines the pregnancy to be a sham. Infuriated, the master orders Songlian&#x27;s lanterns covered with thick black canvas bags indefinitely. Blaming the sequence of events on Yan&#x27;er, Songlian reveals to the house that Yan&#x27;er&#x27;s room is filled with lit red lanterns, showing that Yan&#x27;er dreams of becoming a mistress instead of a lowly servant; it is suggested earlier that Yan&#x27;er is in love with the master and has even slept with him in the Fourth Mistress&#x27; bed.

Yan&#x27;er is punished by having the lanterns burned while she kneels in the snow, watching as they smolder. In an act of defiance, Yan&#x27;er refuses to humble herself or apologize, and thus remains kneeling in the snow throughout the night until she collapses. Yan&#x27;er falls sick and ultimately dies after being taken to the hospital. One of the servants tells Songlian that her former maid died with her mistress&#x27;s name on her lips. Songlian, who had briefly attended university before the death of her father and being forced into marriage, comes to the conclusion that she is happier in solitude; she eventually sees the competition between the women as a useless endeavor, as each woman is merely a &quot;robe&quot; that the master may wear and discard at his discretion.

As Songlian retreats further into her solitude, she begins speaking of suicide; she reasons that dying is a better fate than being a wife in the Chen household. On her twentieth birthday, severely intoxicated and despondent over her bitter fate, Songlian inadvertently blurts out the details of the love affair between Meishan and Doctor Gao to Zhuoyun, who later catches the adulterous couple together. Following the old customs and traditions, Meishan is dragged to a lone room (also known as the room of death earlier on) on the roof of the estate and is hanged to death by the master&#x27;s servants.

Songlian, already in agony due to the fruitlessness of her life, witnesses the entire episode and is emotionally traumatized. The following summer, after the Master&#x27;s marriage to yet another concubine, Songlian is shown wandering the compound in her old schoolgirl clothes, appearing to have gone completely insane.

==Distribution==
&quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; has been distributed on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD by numerous different distributors, with many coming under criticism for their poor quality.

The Razor Digital Entertainment DVD release has been widely criticised. DVD Times states &quot;Many other viewers will find this DVD release simply intolerable.&quot; DVDTown criticised the same release, giving the video quality 1 out of 10 and the audio quality 6 out of 10, summarising that &quot;the video is a disaster&quot;. DVDFile adds to this stating &quot;this horrible DVD is only recommended to those who love the movie so much, that they’ll put up with anything to own a Region 1 release.&quot; The translation on this version has been also widely criticised for its numerous inaccuracies. A release by Rajon Vision has also received poor commentary.

ERA&#x27;s first release received similar attention but the second digitally remastered edition has been more warmly received with DVD Times stating that &quot;It&#x27;s a film that really needs a Criterion edition with a new print or a full restoration, but in the absence of any likelihood of that, this Era Hong Kong edition is about as good as you could hope for.&quot; DVDBeaver broadly agrees stating &quot;Now, this is not Criterion image quality, but it is not bad at all. It is easily the best digital representation of this film currently available.&quot; DVD Talk, though, believes that &quot;This new version is a stunner&quot;.

A new MGM release in 2007 has also received some positive feedback.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; has sold copyright to 35 countries worldwide. It was a big hit in Europe, with 43 copies touring in Italy, from big towns to small towns, grossing more than $3 million. France, with nine copies, grossing more than $2 million. It was released on March 13, 1992, and final grossing in the US market is $2,603,061. Outside Asia, &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; earned of $11 million for production company HK ERA International

===Critical response===
Described as &quot;one of the landmark films of the 1990s&quot; by Jonathan Crow of AllMovie, where it received five out of five, &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; has been well received. James Berardinelli named it his 7th best film of the 1990s. It has a 97% rating at review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Visually thrilling and rich with emotion, &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; offers an engrossing period drama anchored by an outstanding performance from Gong Li&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave it five out of five. However, there were a small number of negative reviews: Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, for example, stated that &quot;the story never amounts to much more than a rather tepid Chinese rendition of &quot;&quot;The Women&quot;.&quot; The film ranked #28 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazines &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

The film has also been praised for its artistic merit. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that &quot;In purely aesthetic terms, &quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; is breathtaking&quot; and James Berardinelli stated that &quot;the appeal to the eye only heightens the movie&#x27;s emotional power&quot;. John Hartl of Film.com described it to be &quot;a near-perfect movie that often recalls the visual purity and intensity of silent films&quot;. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film four out of four stars, praising its screenplay, actors, and visuals; there he concluded as thus &quot;There is a sense in which &#x27;Raise the Red Lantern&#x27; exists solely for the eyes. Entirely apart from the plot, there is the sensuous pleasure of the architecture, the fabrics, the color contrasts, the faces of the actresses. But beneath the beauty is the cruel reality of this life, just as beneath the comfort of the rich man&#x27;s house is the sin of slavery.&quot; He later placed the film on his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list.

The film&#x27;s popularity has also been attributed to a resurgence in Chinese tourism after the government response to the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989, due to its use of exotic locations.

&quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot; was one of the films with most appearances on 1992&#x27;s year-end lists, appearing on 36 lists.

<text>Aulus Gellius (c. 125after 180 AD) was a Roman author and grammarian, who was probably born and certainly brought up in Rome. He was educated in Athens, after which he returned to Rome. He is famous for his &quot;Attic Nights&quot;, a commonplace book, or compilation of notes on grammar, philosophy, history, antiquarianism, and other subjects, preserving fragments of the works of many authors who might otherwise be unknown today.

==Name==
Medieval manuscripts of the &quot;Noctes Atticae&quot; commonly gave the author&#x27;s name in the form of &quot;Agellius&quot;, which is used by Priscian; Lactantius, Servius and Saint Augustine had &quot;A. Gellius&quot; instead. Scholars from the Renaissance onwards hotly debated which one of the two transmitted names is correct (the other one being presumably a corruption) before settling on the latter of the two in modern times.

==Life==
The only source for the life of Aulus Gellius is the details recorded in his writings. Internal evidence points to Gellius having been born between AD 125 and 128. He was of good family and connections, and he was probably born and certainly brought up in Rome. He attended the Pythian Games in the year 147, and resided for a considerable period in Athens. Gellius studied rhetoric under Titus Castricius and Sulpicius Apollinaris; philosophy under Calvisius Taurus and Peregrinus Proteus; and enjoyed also the friendship and instruction of Favorinus, Herodes Atticus, and Fronto.

He returned to Rome, where he held a judicial office. He was appointed by the praetor to act as an umpire in civil causes, and much of the time which he would gladly have devoted to literary pursuits was consequently occupied by judicial duties.
==&quot;Attic Nights&quot;==
Gellius&#x27; only known work is the &quot;Attic Nights&quot; (), which takes its name from having been begun during the long nights of a winter which he spent in Attica. He afterwards continued it in Rome. It is compiled out of an &quot;Adversaria&quot;, or commonplace book, in which he had jotted down everything of unusual interest that he heard in conversation or read in books, and it comprises notes on grammar, geometry, philosophy, history and many other subjects. One story is the fable of Androcles, which is often included in compilations of Aesop&#x27;s fables, but was not originally from that source. Internal evidence led Leofranc Holford-Strevens to date its publication in or after AD 177.

The work, deliberately devoid of sequence or arrangement, is divided into twenty books. All have survived except the eighth, of which only the index survives. The &quot;Attic Nights&quot; are valuable for the insight they afford into the nature of the society and pursuits of those times, and for its many excerpts from works of lost ancient authors.

The &quot;Attic Nights&quot; found many readers in antiquity. Writers who used this compilation include Apuleius, Lactantius, Nonius Marcellus, Ammianus Marcellinus, the anonymous author of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, Servius, and Augustine; but most notable is how Gellius&#x27; work was mined by Macrobius, &quot;who, without mentioning his name, quotes Gellius verbatim throughout the &quot;Saturnalia&quot;, and is thus of the highest value for the text&quot;.

===Editions===
The &quot;editio princeps&quot; was published at Rome in 1469 by Giovanni Andrea Bussi, bishop-designate of Aleria. The earliest critical edition was by Ludovicus Carrio in 1585, published by Henricus Stephanus; however, the projected commentary fell victim to personal quarrels. Better known is the critical edition of Johann Friedrich Gronovius; although he devoted his entire life to work on Gellius, he died in 1671 before his work could be completed. His son Jakob published most of his comments on Gellius in 1687, and brought out a revised text with all of his father&#x27;s comments and other materials at Leyden in 1706; this later work became known as the &quot;Gronoviana&quot;. According to Leofranc Holford-Strevens, the &quot;Gronoviana&quot; remained the standard text of Gellius for over a hundred years, until the edition of Martin Hertz (Berlin, 1883–85; there is also a smaller edition by the same author, Berlin, 1886), revised by C. Hosius, 1903, with bibliography. A volume of selections, with notes and vocabulary, was published by Nall (London, 1888). There is an English translation by W. Beloe (London, 1795), and a French translation (1896). A more recent English translation is by John Carew Rolfe (1927) for the Loeb Classical Library. More recently, Peter K. Marshall&#x27;s edition (Oxford U. Press, 1968, 1990 (reissued with corrections) seems widespread both in print and digital (open access) formats.

<text>Vehicle audio is equipment installed in a car or other vehicle to provide in-car entertainment and information for the occupants. Until the 1950s, it consisted of a simple AM radio. Additions since then have included FM radio (1952), 8-track tape players, cassette players, record players, CD players, DVD players, Blu-ray players, navigation systems, Bluetooth telephone integration and audio streaming, and smartphone controllers like CarPlay and Android Auto. Once controlled from the dashboard with a few buttons, they can be controlled by steering wheel controls and voice commands.

Initially implemented for listening to music and radio, vehicle audio is now part of car telematics, telecommunications, in-vehicle security, handsfree calling, navigation, and remote diagnostics systems. The same loudspeakers may also be used to minimize road and engine noise with active noise control, or they may be used to augment engine sounds, for example, making a small engine sound bigger.

==History==
===Radio===
In 1904, before commercially viable technology for mobile radio was in place, American inventor and self-described &quot;Father of Radio&quot; Lee de Forest demonstrated a car radio at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis.

Around 1920, vacuum tube technology had matured to the point where the availability of radio receivers made radio broadcasting viable. A technical challenge was that the vacuum tubes in the radio receivers required 50 to 250 volt direct current, but car batteries ran at 6V. Voltage was stepped up with a vibrator that provided a pulsating DC which could be converted to a higher voltage with a transformer, rectified, and filtered to create higher-voltage DC.

In 1924, Kelly&#x27;s Motors in NSW, Australia, installed its first car radio.

In 1930, the American Galvin Manufacturing Corporation marketed a Motorola-branded radio receiver for $130. It was expensive: the contemporary Ford Model A cost $540. A Plymouth sedan, &quot;wired for Philco Transitone radio without extra cost,&quot; was advertised in &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; in 1931. In 1932 in Germany the Blaupunkt AS 5 medium wave and longwave radio was marketed for 465 Reichsmark, about one-third of the price of a small car. Because it took nearly 10 litres of space, it could not be located near the driver and was operated via a steering wheel remote control. In 1933, Crossley Motors offered a factory fitted car radio for £35. By the late 1930s, push button AM radios were considered a standard feature. In 1946, there were an estimated 9 million AM car radios in use.

An FM receiver was offered by Blaupunkt in 1952. In 1953, Becker introduced the AM/FM Becker Mexico with a Variometer tuner, basically a station-search or scan function.

In April 1955, the Chrysler Corporation announced that it was offering a Mopar model 914HR branded Philco all-transistor car radio, as a $150 option for its 1956 Chrysler and Imperial car models. Chrysler Corporation had decided to discontinue its all-transistor car radio option at the end of 1956, due to it being too expensive, and replaced it with a cheaper hybrid (transistors and low voltage vacuum tubes) car radio for its new 1957 car models. In 1963, Becker introduced the Monte Carlo, a tubeless solid state radio with no vacuum tubes.

From 1974 to 2005, the Autofahrer-Rundfunk-Informationssystem was used by the German ARD network. Developed jointly by the and Blaupunkt, it indicated the presence of traffic announcements through manipulation of the 57kHz subcarrier of the station&#x27;s FM signal. ARI was replaced by the Radio Data System.

The AM/FM radio combined with a CD player has remained a mainstay of car audio, despite being obsolescent in non-car applications.

In the 2010s, internet radio, satellite radio, streaming, and podcasting came into competition with AM/FM radio. By this time some models were offering 5.1 surround sound.

In 2023, several automobile manufacturers, including Ford Motor Company, announced plans to discontinue offering the AM radio band in new vehicles, starting with the 2024 model year. Ford later reversed its announcement, with chief executive officer Jim Farley citing the importance of AM&#x27;s emergency alert system. Audi, BMW, Volvo, and Tesla had already started to not offer the AM band on their entertainment systems, specifically on their electric vehicles. The previous announcement had several lawmakers introduce bipartisan legislation to require that automobile manufactures include the AM band on their audio/entertainment systems.

===Physical media and connectivity===
Mobile players for physical media have been provided for vinyl records, 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, compact discs, and MP3s. The increased sophistication of the vehicle audio system to accommodate such media has made the audio unit a common target of car break-ins, so these are equipped with anti-theft systems too.

Attempts at providing mobile play from media were first made with vinyl records, beginning in the 1950s. The first such player was offered by Chrysler as an option on 1956 Chrysler, Desoto, Dodge, and Plymouth cars. The player was developed by CBS Labs and played a limited selection of specially provided 7-inch discs at 16⅔ RPM. The unit was an expensive option and was dropped after two years. Cheaper options using commonly available 45 rpm records were made by RCA Victor (available only in 1961) and Norelco. All of these players required extra pressure on the needle to avoid skipping during vehicle movement, which caused accelerated wear on the records.

In 1962, Muntz introduced the Wayfarer 4-track cartridge tape player. Celebrities, including Frank Sinatra, had these units installed in their cars.

In 1965, Ford and Motorola jointly introduced the in-car 8-track tape player as optional equipment for 1966 Ford car models. In 1968, a dashboard car radio with a built-in cassette tape player was introduced by Philips. In subsequent years, cassettes supplanted the 8-track and improved the technology, with longer play times, better tape quality, auto-reverse, and Dolby noise reduction. They were popular throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Cassette players were still found in vehicles as late as the 2005–06 Honda CR-V and 2008 Acura TL. There have also been vehicle audio units that accept both compact cassettes and CDs.

Pioneer introduced the CDX-1, the first car CD (compact disc) player, in 1984. It was known for its improved sound quality, instant track skipping, and the format&#x27;s increased durability over cassette tapes. Car CD changers started to gain popularity in the late 1980s and continued throughout the 1990s, with the earlier devices being trunk-mounted and later ones being mounted in the head unit, some able to accommodate six to ten CDs. Stock and aftermarket CD players began appearing in the late 1980s, competing with the cassette. The first car with an OEM CD player was the 1987 Lincoln Town Car, and the last new cars in the American market to be factory-equipped with a cassette deck in the dashboard was the 2010 Lexus SC430, and the Ford Crown Victoria. A car cassette adapter allowed motorists to plug in a portable music player (CD player, MP3 player) into an existing installed cassette tape deck.

In the early 21st century, compact digital storage media – Bluetooth-enabled devices, thumb drives, memory cards, and dedicated hard drives – came to be accommodated by vehicle audio systems. Around this time auxiliary input jacks and USB ports were added to connect MP3 players to the vehicle&#x27;s speakers. Minivans and three-row SUVs have an available rear entertainment system with a DVD player to entertain passengers.

The automobile head unit became increasingly important as a housing for front and backup dashcams, navis, and operating systems with multiple functions, such as Android Auto, CarPlay and MirrorLink, allowing a smartphone&#x27;s music library and navigation apps to be controlled via the vehicle&#x27;s infotainment system. Latest models are coming equipped with features like Bluetooth technology along with HDMI port for better connectivity. Screen size varies from 5-inch to 7-inch for the double Din car stereos.

===Active noise control and noise synthesis===
The automobile sound system may be part of an active noise control system which reduces engine and road noise for the driver and passengers. One or more microphones are used to pick up sound from various places on the vehicle, especially the engine compartment, underside, or exhaust pipes, and these signals are handled by a digital signal processor (DSP) and then sent to the loudspeakers in such a way that the processed signal reduces or cancels out the outside noise heard inside the car. An early system focused only on engine noise was developed by Lotus and licensed for the 1992 Nissan Bluebird models sold in Japan. Lotus later teamed with Harman in 2009 to develop a more complete noise reduction system, including road and tire noise as well as chassis vibrations. One benefit of active noise control is that the car can weigh less, with less sound-deadening material used, and without a heavy balance shaft in the engine. Removing the balance shaft also increases fuel efficiency. The 2013 Honda Accord used an active noise control system, as did the 2013 Lincoln luxury line and the Ford C-Max and Fusion models. Other operating data may also play a part in the DSP, data such as the engine&#x27;s speed in revolutions per minute (RPM) or the car&#x27;s highway speed. A multiple source reduction system may reach as much as 80% of the noise removed.

The same system may also be used to synthesize or augment engine noise to make the engine sound more powerful to the driver. For the 2015 Ford Mustang EcoBoost Fastback and EcoBoost Fastback Premium, an &quot;Active Noise Control&quot; system was developed that amplifies the engine sound through the car speakers. A similar system is used in the F-150 pickup truck. Volkswagen uses a Soundaktor, a special speaker to play sounds in cars such as the Golf GTi and Beetle Turbo. BMW plays a recorded sample of its motors through the car speakers, using different samples according to the engine&#x27;s load and power.

==Components and terms==
The stock system is the OEM application that the vehicle&#x27;s manufacturer specified to be installed when the car was built.

Aftermarket components can also be used.

* Head unit: Headunit products includes the screen and buttons and are manufactured mainly in DIN form factor, which refers to ISO 7736. Head units come as single DIN or double DIN.
* Connectors for car audio, where ISO 10487 Harness Adapter is used.
* Capacitors.
* Mobile audio power amplifiers.

Amplifiers increase the power level of audio signals. Some head units have built-in stereo amplifiers. Other car audio systems use a separate stand-alone amplifier. Every amplifier has a rated power level sometimes noted on the head unit with the built-in amplifier, or on the label of a stand-alone unit.

# Coaxial speakers: These are the most common type of car speakers and are often factory-installed. They usually consist of a woofer and a tweeter mounted on the same axis, and are designed to reproduce a wide range of frequencies.
# Component speakers: These speakers are designed for higher-end car audio systems and typically consist of separate woofers, tweeters, and crossovers. This allows for more precise sound tuning and a higher level of sound quality.
# Subwoofers: These speakers are designed to reproduce low-frequency sounds, particularly bass. They come in various sizes and power levels, and can be used to enhance the bass in a car audio system.
# Mid-range speakers: These speakers are designed to reproduce mid-range frequencies, such as vocals and instruments like guitars and pianos.
# Tweeters: These speakers are designed to reproduce high-frequency sounds, such as cymbals and other high-pitched instruments.
# Sound-deadening material is often used in the door cavities and boot area to dampen excess vibration of the panels in the car in response to loud subwoofer bass tones, especially the boot (trunk).
# Optical drives with slot-loading mechanism.

==Legality==
Excessively loud sound systems in automobiles violate the noise ordinance of municipalities, some of which have outlawed them. In 2002, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a guide to police officers on how to deal with problems associated with loud audio systems in cars.

=== Membership timeline ===
 

== History ==
CUSA (abbreviated &quot;C-USA&quot; before 2023) was founded in 1995 by the merger of the Metro Conference and Great Midwest Conference, two Division I conferences that did not sponsor football. However, the merger did not include either Great Midwest member Dayton or Metro members VCU and Virginia Tech. Since this left an uneven number of schools in the conference, Houston of the dissolving Southwest Conference was extended an invitation and agreed to join following the SWC&#x27;s disbanding at the end of the 1995–96 academic year. The conference immediately started competition in all sports, except football which started in 1996.

Being the result of a merger, CUSA was originally a sprawling, large league that stretched from Florida to Missouri, Wisconsin to Texas. Many of its original schools were located in major urban centers and had strong basketball traditions, which helped establish the league on a national basis.

===2005–06 realignment===
The conference saw radical changes for the 2005–06 academic year. The Big East Conference had lost several members, and looked to Conference USA to attract replacements. Five CUSA members departed for the Big East, including three football-playing schools (Cincinnati, Louisville, and South Florida) and two non-football schools (DePaul and Marquette; both joined the New Big East in 2013). Another two schools (Charlotte and Saint Louis) left for the Atlantic 10; TCU joined the Mountain West (and is now in the Big 12 with several other former Southwest Conference members); and a ninth member, Army, which was C-USA football-only, opted to become an independent in that sport again.

With the loss of these members, CUSA lured six schools from other conferences: UCF and Marshall from the MAC, as well as Rice, SMU, Tulsa, and later UTEP from the WAC. UCF played in the MAC for football only; for all other sports, it was a member of the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN).

With CUSA&#x27;s membership now consisting of 12 schools, all of which sponsor football, the conference adopted a two-division alignment.

===2013–14 realignment===

In 2013, CUSA entered its next phase with the departure of four schools (Houston, Memphis, SMU, and UCF) for the American Athletic Conference, the football-sponsoring portion of the former Big East Conference. This was again the result of Big East schools leaving for the ACC, this time being Syracuse and Pittsburgh, as well as Notre Dame for non-football sports. It was announced in early 2012 that Conference USA was in talks with the Mountain West Conference about forming either a football alliance or conference merger in the future.

However, when the conferences discussed their plans with the NCAA, they were told that if they merged, the new league would receive only one automatic bid to NCAA championships; at least one of the former conferences would lose expected future revenues from the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament; and at least one former conference would lose exit fees from any schools that departed for the new league. As a result, both CUSA and the MW backed away from a full merger. , the likeliest scenario was an all-sports alliance in which both conferences retained separate identities. However, after the MW added more members, the alliance was apparently abandoned.

For men&#x27;s soccer, there was a chance that the MW, SEC, and CUSA along with the one Sun Belt member (FIU), that sponsor the sport, would play under the CUSA&#x27;s men&#x27;s soccer program. The MW, which does not sponsor men&#x27;s soccer, would take three of the four members that offer the sport (UNLV, Air Force, New Mexico—San Diego State is a Pac-12 associate member in that sport), join CUSA&#x27;s three full members that offer the sport (UAB, Marshall, Tulsa), the two SEC members already in CUSA for the sport (Kentucky, South Carolina), and the Sun Belt&#x27;s FIU. However, the only MW member school that ultimately moved to CUSA men&#x27;s soccer was New Mexico.

For the 2013–14 season CUSA invited five new members to join their conference, with all accepting. UTSA and Louisiana Tech joined from the WAC and North Texas and FIU, (an affiliate member of CUSA joining for men&#x27;s soccer in 2005), from the Sun Belt Conference. Old Dominion, which already housed five of its sports in CUSA, moved the rest of its athletic program from the CAA (except for field hockey, women&#x27;s lacrosse and wrestling, with the three sports joining the new Big East, the Atlantic Sun, and the MAC respectively because CUSA does not sponsor those sports) and upgraded its football program from the Football Championship Subdivision. Charter member Charlotte returned from the A-10 and accelerated its recently established football program, which was set to begin play in 2013 as an FCS school, to FBS in 2015 with full conference rights in 2016.

===2014–15 realignment===
On November 27, 2012, it was announced that Tulane would leave the conference to join the Big East in all sports, and East Carolina would join the Big East for football only (ECU&#x27;s membership was upgraded to all-sports in March 2013 after the Big East&#x27;s non-football members, except ACC-bound Notre Dame, announced they were leaving to form a new conference which took the Big East name, leaving the football-playing members to become the American Athletic Conference). Conference USA responded by adding Middle Tennessee and Florida Atlantic, both from the Sun Belt.

On April 1, 2013, Conference USA announced it was adding Western Kentucky, also from the Sun Belt, to offset Tulsa&#x27;s departure to The American in all sports which was confirmed the next day.

===2014–2021===
The board of trustees in the University of Alabama system (of which UAB is a member) voted to shut down that football program on December 2, 2014, in a highly controversial move that many have attributed to a pro-Tuscaloosa bias (including trustees such as Paul Bryant Jr., son and namesake of Alabama football coaching legend Bear Bryant). According to Conference USA bylaws, member schools must sponsor football. In January 2015, UAB announced an independent re-evaluation of the program and the finances involved, leaving open a possible resumption of the program as early as the 2016 season. On January 29, 2015, the conference announced that there was no time pressure in making a decision regarding UAB&#x27;s future membership. The conference also stated that it would wait for the new study results before any further discussions on the subject. On June 1, UAB announced that it would reinstate football effective with the 2016 season, presumably keeping the school in CUSA for the immediate future. The return of football was later pushed back to 2017 with their first game in September. The Blazers won the 2018 conference championship their second year back and won the CUSA title again in 2020.

Commissioner Britton Banowsky stepped down on September 15, 2015, to become the head of the College Football Playoff Foundation. Executive associate commissioner and chief operating officer Judy MacLeod was subsequently named interim commissioner. On October 26 MacLeod was named the conference&#x27;s third official commissioner, also becoming the first woman to head an FBS conference.

Marshall University&#x27;s men&#x27;s soccer program captured the league&#x27;s first team national championship with its 1–0 overtime win over Indiana in the 2020 College Cup, held in May 2021 due to COVID-19 issues, in Cary, North Carolina.

=== 2020s realignment ===

On October 18, 2021, Yahoo Sports reported that the American Athletic Conference, which had been rocked by the impending departure of three of its most prominent schools (Cincinnati, Houston, UCF) for the Big 12 Conference, was preparing to receive applications from six CUSA members: Charlotte, Florida Atlantic, North Texas, Rice, UAB, and UTSA. ESPN reported the next day that The American had received all six schools&#x27; applications, and The American announced all six as future members on October 21, though it did not announce the effective date. The entry date would eventually be confirmed as July 1, 2023.

The day after The American announced its expansion, The Action Network reported that Southern Miss had accepted an invitation to join the Sun Belt Conference in 2023, a move which was formally announced by the university on October 26. The report added that the Sun Belt was preparing to add two other CUSA members in Marshall and Old Dominion, as well as FCS program James Madison. Old Dominion officially announced its move to the Sun Belt Conference on October 27, followed later in the week by Marshall. On March 29, 2022, CUSA agreed to allow Marshall, Old Dominion, and Southern Miss to move to the Sun Belt beginning July 1, 2022, a year earlier than initially announced.

In response to these losses, on November 5, Conference USA announced the addition of four new members to start the 2023 athletic season. These included two ASUN schools, Liberty and Jacksonville State, along with two from the WAC, New Mexico State and Sam Houston. Liberty and New Mexico State previously played football as FBS independents, while Jacksonville State and Sam Houston played at the FCS level in their respective conferences.

On October 7, 2022, Pete Thamel of ESPN reported that current football-sponsoring ASUN member Kennesaw State was in talks to become the tenth member of Conference USA for the 2024 season. One week later, CUSA officially announced Kennesaw State&#x27;s 2024 entry.

This was followed by the Sun Belt Conference adding beach volleyball for the 2023 season (2022–23 school year), taking with it the three full SBC members that had previously housed that sport in CUSA: Coastal Carolina, Georgia State, and Louisiana–Monroe. Southern Miss also left CUSA beach volleyball as part of its full-time move to the SBC. CUSA would add three new beach volleyball members for that season; Jacksonville State joined CUSA for beach volleyball in advance of full membership that July, Tulane became an associate member, and full member UTEP added a new beach volleyball program. Tarleton announced on April 24, 2023, that it would join CUSA as an associate member for the school&#x27;s first season of varsity beach volleyball in 2024; CUSA confirmed this on May 11, adding that Missouri State and TCU would also join in beach volleyball for the 2024 season, and that Florida Atlantic and UAB would remain in CUSA beach volleyball after otherwise departing for The American.

On May 10, 2023, CUSA announced that it would add bowling, a women-only sport in the NCAA, effective in 2023–24. The Southland Bowling League, a single-sport conference established by the Southland Conference, was merged into CUSA. The bowling league added Wichita State when it elevated its club team to varsity status in 2024–25.

The conference unveiled a &quot;brand refresh&quot; on July 1, 2023, the same day that Jacksonville State, Liberty, New Mexico State, and Sam Houston joined. The former abbreviation of &quot;C-USA&quot; was retired in favor of &quot;CUSA&quot;, and the logo was slightly updated.

On November 27, 2023, Pete Thamel reported on X that Conference USA was expected to add Delaware as a new member for the 2025–26 season. On Tuesday, November 28, 2023, both CUSA and Delaware announced on their websites and social the official move to make Delaware the eleventh all-sports member of the conference. Six months later, on May 10, 2024, both CUSA and Missouri State University jointly announced on their respective websites that Missouri State would also join the league for the 2025–26 season, bringing league membership up to 12. The 12-member lineup will last only one year, as UTEP, the longest-tenured current member, will leave for the Mountain West Conference in 2026.

On November 5, 2024, the conference announced that former full member South Florida would join as an affiliate member in beach volleyball in 2025.

==Hall of Fame==

In 2019, Conference USA inducted its first Hall of Fame class, comprising 20 student-athletes, three coaches, and two administrators. The inductees included former University of Cincinnati basketball player Kenyon Martin, baseball player Kevin Youkilis, and men&#x27;s basketball head coach Bob Huggins.

===Sports sponsored===
Conference USA sponsors championship competition in eight men&#x27;s and 11 women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports. Twelve schools are affiliate members—one in baseball, four in beach volleyball, six in bowling, and one in both beach volleyball and bowling. The most recent changes in sports sponsorship were the dropping of men&#x27;s soccer and women&#x27;s swimming and diving after the 2021–22 season, plus the addition of bowling in 2023–24.

Through the 2023 season, the highest-ranked champion from the so-called &quot;Group of Five&quot; conferences (The American, CUSA, MAC, Mountain West, and Sun Belt) was guaranteed a berth in one of the non-semifinal bowls of the College Football Playoff if the group&#x27;s top team was not in the playoff. Starting in 2024, at least one Group of Five conference champion will receive a berth in the expanded 12-team CFP.

For the 2014–19 seasons, Conference USA was guaranteed at least five of the following bowl games. Stadiums and names reflect those in use during that period.

The only current CUSA member to have won a national team championship while a member of the conference is Jacksonville State, which won the 2024 bowling championship in its first season of both varsity bowling and CUSA membership. The only other school to have won such a championship while a CUSA member is Marshall, which moved to the Sun Belt Conference in 2022. Marshall won the 2020–21 men&#x27;s soccer championship in May 2021 (with the tournament having moved from its normal schedule in fall 2020 to spring 2021 due to COVID-19).

The following current and future CUSA teams have won national championships when they were not affiliated with CUSA. Current associate members, indicated in &quot;italics&quot;, are listed with championships they won in their CUSA sports.

== Media ==
In 2016, CUSA began a long-term television contract with lead partners ESPN and CBS Sports Network, with ESPN carrying 5 football games and the football championship game; and CBSSN carrying 6 football games, 5 basketball games, and both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball championship games. CUSA also renewed and expanded its partnership with American Sports Network; owned and operated by Sinclair Broadcast Group, ASN will carry between 15 and 30 football games; between 13 and 55 men&#x27;s basketball games; and between 2 and 5 women&#x27;s basketball games. ASN will also carry 10 events in other C-USA sports.

The conference also entered into a contract with beIN Sports for 10 football games (marking the first domestic American football rights the network has ever acquired, and the first broadcast rights deal it had ever entered into with a college conference), 10 men&#x27;s and 10 women&#x27;s basketball games, 12 baseball and 12 softball games, 10 men&#x27;s and 10 women&#x27;s soccer games (excluding conference men&#x27;s soccer games at Kentucky and South Carolina, covered by their primary conference&#x27;s contract), and 10 women&#x27;s volleyball games.

The total values of the 2016 contracts are notably lower than those of the previous contracts (which included Fox Sports).

Former men&#x27;s soccer associate members Kentucky and South Carolina have an agreement with their primary conference for other sports to carry all home matches online through the SEC Network service. This included all of those teams&#x27; matches against CUSA opponents before the two schools moved men&#x27;s soccer to the Sun Belt Conference in 2022. ESPN and the SEC Network had first rights to all CUSA home men&#x27;s soccer matches featuring both schools.

In 2017 American Sports Network and Campus Insiders merged creating Stadium. Stadium&#x27;s C-USA content will be available to stream on Twitter and Pluto TV. In 2017 Stadium completed a deal with Facebook to exclusively stream some C-USA football games. In 2017 CUSA entered an agreement with the streaming subscription service FloSports to stream three football games.

===CUSA.tv===

In 2016 CUSA partnered with SIDEARM Sports to create a subscription based streaming service named CUSA.tv. In a statement CUSA Commissioner Judy MacLeod said, &quot;Thanks to our partnership with SIDEARM Sports, this new site showcases a clean modern look with easy access to information and we are proud to offer live content and original feature stories through our CUSA.tv.&quot; Various sports including football, basketball, and baseball will exclusively air on CUSA.tv when they are not picked up by other networks.

==Academics==
One of the departing member schools, Rice University, is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU), an organization of 62 leading research universities in the United States and Canada. Six of the Conference&#x27;s 14 members are doctorate-granting universities with &quot;very high research activity,&quot; the highest classification given by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching; however, four of these six schools (Charlotte, North Texas, Rice, UTSA) are leaving for the American Athletic Conference in July 2023. A majority of the Conference&#x27;s members are ranked as Tier One National Universities in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2022 Best Colleges rankings.

<text>Dial House is a farm cottage situated in south-west Essex, England that has been a self-sustaining anarcho-pacifist open house since 1967. The house is located in the countryside of Epping Forest in Ongar Great Park. It has been used as a base for a number of cultural, artistic, and political projects ranging from avant-garde jazz events to helping found the free festival movement.

Perhaps the best-known manifestation of the public face of Dial House was the anarcho-punk band Crass. Following the DIY punk ethic, Crass combined the use of song, film, sound collage, and graphics to launch a critical polemic against a mainstream which they considered to be built on foundations of war, religion, and consumerism.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Dial House, a large rambling farm cottage, was built in the 16th century. Oliver Rackham describes Ongar Great Park as possibly having been the &quot;prototype deer park&quot;, mentioned in an &quot;Anglo-Saxon will of 1045&quot;. During the Victorian era, Dial House was the home of the writer Primrose McConnell, a tenant farmer and the author of &quot;The Agricultural Notebook&quot; (1883), which is recognised as a standard reference work for the European farming industry. By 1967 Dial House stood derelict, its acre of garden a bramble-smothered wilderness. Dial House is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England.

=== Crass ===
In 1967, former drummer of Crass Penny Rimbaud began using Dial House as an open space, removing doors and inviting friends to stay in the cottage. Rimbaud moved into the house with Gee Vaucher and established an &quot;open house&quot; policy. Dial House became the site of organizing for the anarchist movement, including the Stonehenge Free Festival.

<doc id="78432" wikidata="Q317055" url="?curid=78432" title="Marcus Cornelius Fronto">
<text>Marcus Cornelius Fronto (c. 100late 160s AD), best known as Fronto, was a Roman grammarian, rhetorician, and advocate. Of Berber origin, he was born at Cirta (modern-day Constantine, Algeria) in Numidia. He was suffect consul for the &quot;nundinium&quot; of July–August 142 with Gaius Laberius Priscus as his colleague. Emperor Antoninus Pius appointed him tutor to his adopted sons, the future emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus.

==Life==
Fronto was born a Roman citizen in the year 100 in the Numidian capital, Cirta. He described himself as a Libyan of the nomadic Libyans. He was taught as a child by the Greek paedagogus Aridelus.

Later, he continued his education at Rome with the philosopher Athenodotus and the orator Dionysius.
He soon gained such renown as an advocate and orator as to be reckoned inferior only to Cicero. He amassed a large fortune, erected magnificent buildings, and purchased the famous gardens of Maecenas.

In 142 he was consul for two months (August and September) but declined the proconsulship of Asia on the grounds of ill-health. His latter years were embittered by the loss of all his children except one daughter. His talents as an orator and rhetorician were greatly admired by his contemporaries, a number of whom were later regarded as forming a school called &quot;Frontoniani&quot; after him; his object in his teaching was to inculcate the exact use of the Latin language in place of the artificialities of such 1st-century authors as Seneca the Younger and to encourage the use of &quot;unlooked-for and unexpected words&quot;, to be found by diligent reading of pre-Ciceronian authors. He found fault with Cicero for inattention to that refinement, though admiring his letters without reserve. He may well have died in the late 160s as a result of the Antonine Plague that followed the Parthian War, though conclusive proof is lacking. C.R. Haines asserts he died in 166 or 167.

==Surviving works==
Until 1815, the only extant works ascribed (erroneously) to Fronto were two grammatical treatises, &quot;De nominum verborumque differentiis&quot; and &quot;Exempla elocutionum&quot; (the latter being really by Arusianus Messius). In that year, Angelo Mai discovered in the Ambrosian library at Milan a palimpsest manuscript, on which had been originally written some of Fronto&#x27;s letters to his imperial pupils and their replies; four years later Mai found several more sheets from this manuscript in the Vatican. These palimpsests had originally belonged to the famous convent of St Columbanus at Bobbio and had been written over by the monks with the acts of the First Council of Chalcedon.

The letters from the Ambrosian palimpsest, along with the other fragments, were published at Rome in 1815. The Vatican texts were added in 1823, as was the end of his &quot;Gratiarum actio pro Carthaginiensibus&quot; from another Vatican manuscript. It was not until 1956 that Bernhard Bischoff identified a third manuscript (consisting of a single leaf) that contained fragments of Fronto&#x27;s correspondence with Verus which overlapped the Milan palimpsest; however, the actual manuscript had been first published in 1750 by Dom Tassin, who conjectured that it might have been the work of Fronto.

These fragments disappointed Romantic scholars as not matching the writer&#x27;s great reputation, partly because Fronto&#x27;s teachings, with their emphasis on studying ancient writers in search of striking words, were not in accordance with current fashion (Italy, where not only Mai but Leopardi enthused over them, was an exception), partly because they gave no support to the assumption that Fronto had been a wise counsellor to Marcus Aurelius (indeed, they contain no trace of political advice), and partly because his frequent complaints about ill health, especially those collected in book 5 of &quot;Ad M. Caesarem&quot;, aroused more annoyance than compassion. These adverse judgements were reversed once Fronto was read for what he was rather than what he was not, as already in the sympathetic treatment by Dorothy Brock, &quot;Studies in Fronto and his Age&quot; (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1911).

The bulk of the letters consist of correspondence with Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, in which the character of Fronto&#x27;s pupils appears in a very favourable light, especially in the affection they both seem to have retained for their old master. There are also letters to friends, chiefly letters of recommendation, but including one (&quot;Ad amicos&quot; 1. 19) in which an out-of-sorts Fronto (&quot;ego epistulas invitissime scribo&quot;, &quot;I hate writing letters&quot;) complains of Aulus Gellius&#x27; attempts to procure copies of his writings for publication. (Fronto appears in five chapters of the &quot;Noctes Atticae&quot;, though expressing tastes that sometime seem closer to Gellius&#x27; own than to those evinced in the letters.) The collection also contains treatises on eloquence, some historical fragments, and literary trifles on such subjects as the praise of smoke and dust, of negligence, and a dissertation on Arion. In addition, a fragment of a speech is preserved by Minucius Felix (&quot;Octavius&quot; 9. 6–7) in which Fronto accuses the Christians of incestuous orgies.

Marcus Aurelius, in his &quot;Meditations&quot;, says nothing of Fronto&#x27;s rhetorical teaching; nor, although writing in Greek, does he so much as mention his teacher of Greek rhetoric and longtime friend Herodes Atticus. He does, however, credit Fronto with teaching him about the vices of tyranny and the lack of affection in the Roman upper class (1.11); since the former were commonplaces, there may be a concealed reference to life under Hadrian, whom Fronto retrospectively claims to have feared rather than loved, but the latter is borne out by the master&#x27;s remark that there is no Latin equivalent for the Greek &quot;philóstorgos&quot;, meaning &quot;affectionate&quot;. The letters between Aurelius and Fronto, which reveal the intimate nature of their relationship, are the only love letters to survive from antiquity.

The &quot;editio princeps&quot; was by Mai, as described above; the standard edition is the Teubner text by M. van den Hout (Leipzig, 1988). The Loeb Classical Library printed an edition of Fronto&#x27;s correspondence with a facing English translation by C. R. Haines in two volumes (1919–1920); its text, though dated, is still of interest. Van den Hout also published a full-scale commentary in English (Leiden, 1999).

<text>The Mid-American Conference (MAC) is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I collegiate athletic conference with a membership base in the Great Lakes region that stretches from Western New York to Illinois. Nine of the twelve full member schools are in Ohio and Michigan, with single members located in Illinois, Indiana, and New York. For football, the MAC participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Football Bowl Subdivision.

The MAC is headquartered in the Public Square district in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, and has two members in the nearby Akron area. The conference ranks highest among all ten NCAA Division I FBS conferences for graduation rates.

==History==
The five charter members of the Mid-American Conference were Ohio University, Butler University, the University of Cincinnati, Wayne University (now Wayne State University), and Western Reserve University, one of the predecessors to today&#x27;s Case Western Reserve University. Wayne University left after the first year. Miami University and Western Michigan University took the place of those charter members for the 1948 season. The MAC added the University of Toledo (1950), Kent State University (1951), and Bowling Green State University (1952). The University of Cincinnati resigned its membership February 18, 1953, with an effective date of June 1, 1953. Cincinnati&#x27;s decision was based on a new requirement that at least 5 conference football games would have to be scheduled each season, university president Raymond Walters saying they &quot;...regretfully resign...as the university could not continue under the present setup...&quot;

The membership was steady for the next two decades except for the addition of Marshall University in 1954 and the departure of Western Reserve in 1955. Marshall was expelled from the conference in 1969 due to NCAA violations. The first major expansion since the 1950s took place in the mid-1970s with the addition of Central Michigan University and Eastern Michigan University in 1972 and Ball State University and Northern Illinois University in 1973. NIU left after the 1985–86 season. The University of Akron joined the conference in 1992. The conference became the largest in Division I-A with the re-admittance of Marshall and NIU in 1997 and addition of the Bulls from the University at Buffalo in 1998. The University of Central Florida, a non-football all-sports member in the Atlantic Sun Conference at the time, joined for football only in 2002, becoming the first football-only member in conference history. Marshall and Central Florida left after the 2004–05 academic year, both joining Conference USA in all sports.

In May 2005, the Temple Owls in Philadelphia signed a six-year contract with the MAC as a football-only school and began play in the East Division in 2007.

The Louisville Cardinals were a MAC affiliate for field hockey for a number of years when Louisville was a member of the Metro Conference and Conference USA, winning two MAC tourney titles in 2003 and 2004.

The Missouri State Bears, Evansville Purple Aces, and Southern Illinois Salukis participate in the MAC for men&#x27;s swimming and diving. In 2012, the West Virginia Mountaineers joined the Florida Atlantic Owls and Hartwick College Hawks as men&#x27;s soccer affiliates. Florida Atlantic departed upon joining Conference USA in 2013. Hartwick&#x27;s contract was not renewed by the MAC in 2015. Nine schools are wrestling affiliates; most became affiliates when the MAC absorbed the former Eastern Wrestling League in 2019. Appalachian State University and Longwood University are associates in field hockey; Missouri State had also been a member in that sport from 2005 until dropping field hockey after the 2016 season. Binghamton University is an affiliate in men&#x27;s tennis. In June 2017, SIU Edwardsville (SIUE) was invited to become an affiliate member in both men&#x27;s soccer and wrestling in 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hustle Belt/Vox Media, Inc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When Buffalo suddenly dropped four sports, including men&#x27;s soccer, SIUE&#x27;s move in that sport was made immediately.

The UMass Minutemen joined the MAC as a football-only member in July 2012; the university announced that the team would leave the MAC at the end of the 2015 season due to contractual issues. Meanwhile, Temple ended its affiliation with the MAC in football and joined the Big East for football in July 2012. Following the split of the Big East into football-sponsoring and non-football conferences in July 2013, Temple became a full member of the football-sponsoring portion, the American Athletic Conference, ending its membership in the Atlantic 10 at that time. The Chicago State Cougars were an affiliate for men&#x27;s tennis until joining the Western Athletic Conference, which sponsors that sport, in July 2013.

The conference unveiled the addition of women&#x27;s lacrosse to its sport sponsorship in November 2019. Lacrosse began competing under the MAC banner with six teams in the 2021 season with MAC members Akron, Central Michigan and Kent State joined by associate members Detroit Mercy, Robert Morris, and Youngstown State. Eastern Michigan became the seventh women&#x27;s lacrosse member when it added the sport in the 2022 season.

At the end of the 2022 season, the MAC discontinued men&#x27;s soccer as a sponsored sport. While the conference realignment of the early 2020s did not affect the MAC&#x27;s core membership up to that time, it significantly impacted the amount of men&#x27;s soccer sponsoring programs within the conference, and ultimately led to the conference lacking enough teams to maintain its automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Of the four full MAC members that sponsored men&#x27;s soccer in the 2022 season, Bowling Green, Northern Illinois, and Western Michigan moved the sport to the Missouri Valley Conference, and Akron moved it to the Big East Conference.

The MAC eliminated its East and West divisions for football in January 2024. The divisions had already been eliminated for other sports in 2020. Later that year, in late February, it was announced that the UMass Minutemen and Minutewomen will join the conference as a full member beginning in 2025, returning UMass football to the MAC. In July, the conference announced that it would begin sponsoring women&#x27;s rowing for the 2025–26 season; full members Eastern Michigan, Toledo, and UMass would be joined by affiliate members Delaware, High Point, and Temple.

On January 3, 2025, it was reported that Northern Illinois had accepted an invitation from the Mountain West Conference to join as an affiliate member for football in 2026. This move was made official on January 7, after approval by NIU&#x27;s governing board. Current MAC bylaws stipulate that all members must play football within the conference; correspondingly, multiple media reports in February 2025 indicated that NIU was set to rejoin the Horizon League, a non-football conference in which it had been a member from 1994–1997, in 2026. This move was also made official on February 27, after approval by NIU&#x27;s governing board. NIU has applied to maintain MAC affiliate membership in women&#x27;s gymnastics and men&#x27;s wrestling, neither of which the Horizon sponsors.

===Current affiliate members===
Sixteen schools have MAC affiliate membership status as of 2024. On July 1, 2012, Temple joined the Big East Conference for football only (the school&#x27;s other sports would join the Big East/American for 2013–14), and Massachusetts replaced Temple as a football-only member in the MAC East Division. On September 19, 2012, the MAC announced Missouri, Northern Iowa and Old Dominion would join as wrestling affiliates; as the Southeastern and Missouri Valley Conferences do not sponsor wrestling. Missouri and Northern Iowa participated only in the conference tournament in the 2012–13 school year, and began full conference play in 2013–14. Old Dominion did not begin MAC competition until 2013–14, when it left the Colonial Athletic Association (which had sponsored wrestling, but no longer does so) for Conference USA (which has never sponsored the sport). Old Dominion discontinued wrestling in April 2020.

On July 1, 2013, Florida Atlantic&#x27;s men&#x27;s soccer program moved with the rest of its athletic program to Conference USA, and Chicago State&#x27;s men&#x27;s tennis team followed the rest of its sports to the Western Athletic Conference.

The 2014–15 school year saw one affiliate member leave for another conference and two new affiliates join. The Hartwick men&#x27;s soccer team left the MAC for the Sun Belt Conference, which had announced in February 2014 that it would reinstate men&#x27;s soccer, a sport that it last sponsored in 1995, for the 2014 season. The new affiliates for 2014–15 were Binghamton in men&#x27;s tennis and Longwood in field hockey.

On July 1, 2017, one associate member left the MAC, another associate member dropped one of its two MAC sports, and two new schools became associate members. Northern Iowa wrestling moved from the MAC to the Big 12 Conference. Missouri State dropped field hockey, but remained a MAC member in men&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving. Appalachian State joined MAC field hockey, and SIU Edwardsville (SIUE) joined in men&#x27;s soccer. SIUE was initially announced as joining in both men&#x27;s soccer and wrestling in 2018, but less than a week after the initial announcement, the conference indicated that SIUE men&#x27;s soccer would immediately join. SIUE wrestling joined on its originally announced schedule.

On March 5, 2019, the conference announced that it would be adding the seven former members of the Eastern Wrestling League as affiliate members in wrestling, making the MAC the second-largest wrestling conference for academic year 2019–20.

With the addition of women&#x27;s lacrosse, the MAC added affiliate members Detroit Mercy, Robert Morris, and Youngstown State in the 2020–21 academic year. UDM and YSU, all-sports members of the Horizon League, were announced as incoming associates at the same time the MAC announced the addition of lacrosse. RMU was announced as an incoming associate in late June 2020, shortly after the school announced it would join the Horizon League in July 2020.

In June 2020, SIUE announced that it would leave the MAC men&#x27;s soccer league in 2021 to rejoin its previous men&#x27;s soccer home of the Missouri Valley Conference. It remains in MAC wrestling to this day.

Also in 2021, Missouri left MAC wrestling and returned to its former home of the Big 12 Conference as a wrestling-only member. At the same time, four schools became single-sport MAC members—Bellarmine in field hockey, Georgia Southern and Georgia State in men&#x27;s soccer, and Valparaiso in men&#x27;s swimming (the school does not include diving in its men&#x27;s aquatics program).

In 2022, West Virginia men&#x27;s soccer was scheduled to leave the MAC for single-sport membership in Conference USA (CUSA). However, due to the tenuous future of CUSA at that time, West Virginia opted instead to join the Sun Belt Conference (SBC) in 2022 as that league reinstated men&#x27;s soccer. Georgia Southern and Georgia State, both full SBC members, also returned men&#x27;s soccer to their home conference in 2022. In response, the MAC announced that Chicago State would join as a men&#x27;s soccer affiliate as of the 2022–23 season, as the Cougars prepared to depart the Western Athletic Conference in all sports, including soccer. Also in 2022, the MAC gained another affiliate when another Chicago institution, UIC, joined for men&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving. Ultimately, Chicago State&#x27;s tenure as a MAC affiliate lasted only for the 2022 season, as the conference dropped men&#x27;s soccer at season&#x27;s end. 2023 saw UIC adding men&#x27;s tennis to its affiliate membership, as well as the announcement that James Madison would be joining as an affiliate for field hockey in 2024.

In 2024, the Missouri Valley Conference announced it would begin sponsoring men&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving for the 2024–25 season. At the time, the MAC men&#x27;s swimming programs consisted of 2 MAC schools and 5 affiliates from the MVC; correspondingly, all of these programs would move to the MVC for the following season, with the 2 MAC schools (Ball State and Miami) joining the MVC as affiliates for that sport. However, shortly after dropping men&#x27;s swimming, the MAC announced it would begin sponsoring a new sport, women&#x27;s rowing, in 2025–26. Accordingly, it brought on 3 new affiliates for that sport: Delaware, High Point, and former football affiliate Temple.

===Membership timeline===



==Academics==
One of the current full member schools, the University at Buffalo, is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU). All members of the MAC are classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot; except for the University at Buffalo, Kent State University, and Ohio University, which are classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. Member schools are also ranked nationally and globally by various groups, including &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;.

==Sports==
The Mid-American Conference sponsors championship competition in 9 men&#x27;s and 13 women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports, with women&#x27;s lacrosse becoming the newest sport in 2020–21. As of the 2024–25 school year, 16 schools are associate members for four sports.

As the MAC is an FBS conference, its full members are subject to the NCAA requirement that FBS members field teams in at least 16 NCAA-recognized sports. However, as of 2017, the MAC itself required sponsorship of only four sports: football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, and women&#x27;s volleyball. This may have since changed, as UMass was accepted as a new conference member effective in 2025 despite not sponsoring women&#x27;s volleyball.

===Scheduling===
On November 30, 2023, the MAC approved a new scheduling format for football effective for the 2024 season, eliminating its East and West Divisions for the first time since 1996 in favor of a pod-based protected rivalry system. Under the new system, teams will be divided into 4 pods of 3 teams each, and each team will be guaranteed to face the other 2 teams in its pod every season. Additionally, every team in the MAC will be guaranteed to face every other team in the MAC at least once every three years. The MAC Football Championship Game, which previously matched the winner of the East Division against the winner of the West Division, will instead put the two teams in the MAC with the highest conference winning percentage. The pods are as follows:

===All-time results===

* - Buffalo invited to Tangerine Bowl in 1958 / Declined due to Florida&#x27;s segregation laws at the time which would not have allowed Buffalo&#x27;s two black players to participate.

===MAC champions===
Bowl games

In 2017, the MAC was contracted to provide a team for each of five college football bowl games: the Bahamas Bowl, LendingTree Bowl, Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, Camellia Bowl (later renamed the Salute to Veterans Bowl) and Quick Lane Bowl (later renamed the GameAbove Sports Bowl). The MAC also has secondary agreements with several ESPN-owned bowls.

;Notes
* The MAC champion (if not invited to the College Football Playoff or its associated bowls) is not contractually obligated to any specific bowl. The conference and the universities select which teams will play in which of the league&#x27;s affiliated bowls.

===College Football Playoff===
The MAC champion, like the other &quot;Group of 5&quot; conferences receives an automatic berth in one of the so-called New Year&#x27;s Six bowl games associated with the College Football Playoff under either of the following circumstances:
* Selected as one of the top four teams overall by the CFP selection committee, in which case the team will play in a CFP national semifinal.
* Ranked by the committee as the top champion among the five conferences (American, C-USA, MAC, MW, Sun Belt) given access to one of the CFP bowls, in which case the team will play in the so-called &quot;Access Bowl&quot; as an at-large selection.

The first &quot;Access Bowl&quot; berth in 2014 went to Boise State (MW); the 2015 berth went to Houston (American). The MAC got its first berth in 2016 with Western Michigan, who had an undefeated regular season that year and finished ranked at No. 15 in the AP Poll.

During the era of the now-defunct Bowl Championship Series (BCS), one MAC team appeared in a BCS bowl game. In 2012, NIU qualified by being ranked in the top 16 (15th) in the season&#x27;s final BCS standings, and also higher than at least one champion of a conference that received an automatic berth in a BCS game. In the 2012 season, two such conference champions were ranked below NIU: Big East champion Louisville, who was ranked 22nd, and Big Ten champion Wisconsin, who was unranked. NIU lost to Florida State in the Orange Bowl.

===Rivalries===
Football rivalries involving MAC teams include:

In addition, Central Michigan, Eastern Michigan, and Western Michigan compete for the Michigan MAC Trophy, which is awarded to the team with the best head-to-head record each year. Since the inception of the trophy in 2005, Western Michigan has won 7 times, Central Michigan has won 5 times, and Eastern Michigan has won the trophy 4 times. Western Michigan has won the trophy three straight years (2018–2020) as well as six of seven years from 2014 to 2020 (2014–2016, 2018–2020).

==Basketball==

In August 2010, Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher and the Cleveland Cavaliers announced that the Mid-American Conference men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournaments would remain in Cleveland at the venue then known as Quicken Loans Arena and now as Rocket Arena through 2017. Both tournaments have flourished since moving to Cleveland in 2000, with the men&#x27;s semi-finals and championship regularly drawing large crowds at Quicken Loans Arena. In 2007, the MAC also announced a format change for both tournaments, bringing all twelve men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams to Cleveland. The MAC also co-hosted the 2007 Women&#x27;s Final Four at Quicken Loans Arena after successfully hosting the 2006 NCAA Women&#x27;s Basketball Regional at the same facility.

On May 12, 2020, Steinbrecher announced a suite of major changes to the conference&#x27;s competitive format across multiple sports in response to fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific to men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, the following changes took effect in 2020–21 and will continue through at least 2023–24:
* The conference adopted a single league table, eliminating the divisional standings.
* The conference schedule increased from 18 to 20 games.
* Only the top eight men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams advance to their respective conference tournaments.

==Media==
===Broadcasts===
A number of MAC sports, including football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, baseball, soccer, wrestling and volleyball, are telecast on Spectrum Sports, replacing SportsTime Ohio and Fox Sports Ohio as the MAC TV partner. Along with Spectrum Sports, ESPN, as well as the American Sports Network, retain the &quot;local and regional&quot; syndication telecast rights to the MAC for football and basketball.

In 2000 ESPN began broadcasting MAC football games on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The conference agreed to the unusual schedule to increase television ratings by not competing against other football. Fans nicknamed the midweek games MACtion. In 2014 the conference and ESPN agreed to a new contract for 13 years. Each school receives more than $800,000 annually, and plays most November games on weekday nights; 16 of 18 games in 2016 were not on Saturdays, for example. While MACtion decreases stadium attendance, games appear on an ESPN channel to a nationwide audience instead of a less-popular channel or streaming media. While noting the smaller attendance, coaches say that midweek games are good for the conference, and give players a break on Saturdays.

Ball State produces its own comprehensive television package with Ball State Sports Link. Affiliate stations include WIPB in Muncie, WNDY in Indianapolis, WPTA in Fort Wayne, WHME in South Bend, WTVW in Evansville, WYIN in Merrillville and Comcast in Michigan. All Ball State Sports Link games are also broadcast on student radio station WCRD and on the Ball State Radio Network produced by WLBC-FM and Backyard Broadcasting.

NIU has multiple football and basketball games telecast by Comcast SportsNet Chicago. In addition, most NIU football and basketball games can be heard on WSCR-AM 670 &quot;The Score&quot;—Chicago&#x27;s powerful 50,000-watt, top-rated all-sports station, which reaches 38 states and Canada.

===MAC Properties===
MAC Properties (a division of ISP Sports) is the sponsorship arm of the Mid-American Conference, and handles all forms of sponsorship and advertising for the MAC which includes managing and growing its stable of official corporate partners. As of 2010, the MAC has five official corporate partners: FirstEnergy, Marathon, PNC Bank, AutoTrader.com and Cleveland Clinic Sports Health. There are approximately 20 other companies engaged as sponsors of the conference at the non-official level. MAC Properties also assists with the management of the conference&#x27;s television and radio contracts, including those with ESPN Regional, FOX Sports Ohio and ESPN 850 WKNR among others.

<doc id="78436" wikidata="Q58907" url="?curid=78436" title="Philip I of France">
<text>Philip I ( – 29 July 1108), called the Amorous (French: &quot;L’Amoureux&quot;), was King of the Franks from 1060 to 1108. His reign, like that of most of the early Capetians, was extraordinarily long for the time. The monarchy began a modest recovery from the low it had reached during the reign of his father, Henry I, and he added the Vexin region and the viscountcy of Bourges to his royal domaine.

==Early life==

Philip was born c. 1052 at Champagne-et-Fontaine, the son of Henry I and his wife Anne of Kiev. Unusual for the time in Western Europe, his name was of Greek origin, being bestowed upon him by his mother. In 1059 Henry I had Philip crowned in Reims at the age of seven. Philip had a brother named Hugh, who was slightly younger than him. Henry also appointed his brother-in-law Baldwin V of Flanders as regent of the kingdom, a role which Baldwin would share with Anne after the death of Henry in 1060. Despite his young age, Philip would rule in his own right, append royal documents with his own seal, and accompany Baldwin to several administrative visits to Flanders. This close association allowed Baldwin to maintain peaceful relationships between the king and his vassals. At age fourteen Philip was knighted by Baldwin&#x27;s son, Baldwin VI (&quot;the Good&quot;).

==Personal rule==

When Baldwin VI died in 1070, his younger brother Robert the Frisian seized Flanders. Philip invaded Flanders in support of Baldwin&#x27;s widow Richilda, but was defeated by Robert at Cassel in 1071.

Philip appointed Alberic first Constable of France in 1060. A great part of his reign, like his father&#x27;s, was spent putting down revolts by his power-hungry vassals. In 1077, he summoned a great host to relieve Dol-de-Bretagne and prevent the annexation of Brittany by William the Conqueror, who was forced to capitulate and make his peace with Philip. In 1082, Philip I expanded his demesne with the annexation of the Vexin, in reprisal against Robert Curthose&#x27;s attack on William&#x27;s heir, William Rufus. Then in 1100, he took control of Bourges. Philip expanded the royal demesne by incorporating the monasteries of Saint-Denis and Corbie.

In 1106, he married his daughter Constance to Bohemond I of Antioch. The marriage was celebrated in Chartres with great pomp. In 1107, Pope Paschal II met Philip and the future Louis VI in Saint-Denis, cementing a century-long alliance between the kingdom of France and the papacy against the Holy Roman Empire.

Philip&#x27;s reign also saw an increase of foreign expeditions led by the great lords of his kingdom, starting with the siege of Barbastro in 1064. Although the king was mainly concerned with internal politics, troops from his own demesne joined the ranks of William of Normandy during the Conquest of England in 1066, of Odo of Burgundy during the Franco-Spanish campaign against the Almoravids in 1087, and of the various leaders of the First Crusade, in which his brother Hugh of Vermandois was a major participant.

==Personal life==

Philip first married Bertha of Holland in 1072. Although the marriage produced the necessary heir, Philip fell in love with Bertrade de Montfort, the wife of Fulk IV, Count of Anjou. He repudiated Bertha (claiming she was too fat) and married Bertrade on 15 May 1092. In 1094 following the synod of Autun, he was excommunicated by the papal representative, Hugh of Die, for the first time; after a long silence, Pope Urban II repeated the excommunication at the Council of Clermont in November 1095. Several times the ban was lifted as Philip promised to part with Bertrade, but he always returned to her.

In 1101, the sentence was renewed by Urban II in Poitiers, despite the protest of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, who entered the church with his knights to prevent his suzerain from being excommunicated on his lands. After making a public penance in 1104, Philip received absolution and was reconciled with the Church, and must have kept his involvement with Bertrade discreet. In France, the king was opposed by Bishop Ivo of Chartres, a famous jurist.

==Death==

Philip died in the castle of Melun on 29 July 1108, and was buried per his request at the monastery of Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire – and not in St Denis among his forefathers. He was succeeded by his son, Louis VI, whose succession was, however, not uncontested. According to Abbot Suger:

==Issue==
Philip&#x27;s children with Bertha were:
# Constance (1078 – 14 September 1126), married Hugh I of Champagne before 1097 and then, after her divorce, to Bohemund I of Antioch in 1106.
# Louis VI of France (1 December 1081 – 1 August 1137).
# Henry (1083 – died young).

Philip&#x27;s children with Bertrade were:
# Philip, Count of Mantes (1093 – fl. 1123), married Elizabeth, daughter of Guy III of Montlhéry
# Fleury, Seigneur of Nangis (1095 – July 1119)
# Cecile (1097 – 1145), married Tancred, Prince of Galilee and then, after his death, to Pons of Tripoli.

<text>Philip III (1 May 1245 – 5 October 1285), called the Bold (), was King of France from 1270 until his death in 1285. His father, Louis IX, died in Tunis during the Eighth Crusade. Philip, who was accompanying him, returned to France and was anointed king at Reims in 1271.

Philip inherited numerous territorial lands during his reign, the most notable being the County of Toulouse, which was annexed to the royal domain in 1271. With the Treaty of Orléans, he expanded French influence into the Kingdom of Navarre and following the death of his brother Peter during the Sicilian Vespers, the County of Alençon was returned to the crown lands.

Following the Sicilian Vespers, Philip led the Aragonese Crusade in support of his uncle. Initially successful, Philip, his army racked with sickness, was forced to retreat and died from dysentery in Perpignan in 1285 at the age of 40. He was succeeded by his son Philip IV.

==Early life==
Philip was born in Poissy on 1 May 1245, the second son of King Louis IX of France and Margaret of Provence. As a younger son, Philip was not expected to rule France. At the death of his older brother Louis in 1260, he became the heir apparent to the throne.

Philip&#x27;s mother Margaret made him promise to remain under her tutelage until the age of 30; however, Pope Urban IV released him from this oath on 6 June 1263. From that moment on, Pierre de la Broce, a royal favourite and household official of Louis IX, was Philip&#x27;s mentor. His father, Louis, also provided him with advice, writing in particular the &quot;Enseignements&quot;, which inculcated the notion of justice as the first duty of a king.

According to the terms of the Treaty of Corbeil (1258), concluded on 11 March 1258 between Louis IX and James I of Aragon, Philip was married in 1262 to Isabella of Aragon in Clermont by the archbishop of Rouen, Eudes Rigaud.

==Crusade==

As Count of Orléans, Philip accompanied his father on the Eighth Crusade to Tunis in 1270. Shortly before his departure, Louis IX had given the regency of the kingdom into the hands of Mathieu de Vendôme and Simon II, Count of Clermont, to whom he had also entrusted the royal seal. After taking Carthage, the army was struck by an epidemic of dysentery, which spared neither Philip nor his family. His brother John Tristan, Count of Valois died first, on 3 August, and on 25 August the King died. To prevent putrefaction of his remains, it was decided to carry out &quot;mos Teutonicus&quot;, the process of rendering the flesh from the bones so as to make transporting the remains feasible.

Philip, only 25 years old and stricken with dysentery, was proclaimed king in Tunis. His uncle, Charles I of Naples, negotiated with Muhammad I al-Mustansir, Hafsid Caliph of Tunis. A treaty was concluded 5 November 1270 between the kings of France, Sicily and Navarre and the Caliph of Tunis.

Other deaths followed this debacle. In December, in Trapani, Sicily, Philip&#x27;s brother-in-law, King Theobald II of Navarre, died. He was followed in February by Philip&#x27;s wife, Isabella, who fell off her horse while pregnant with their fifth child. She died in Cozenza (Calabria). In April, Theobald&#x27;s widow and Philip&#x27;s sister, Isabella, also died.

Philip III arrived in Paris on 21 May 1271, and paid tribute to the deceased. The next day the funeral of his father was held. The new sovereign was crowned king of France in Reims on 15 August 1271.

==Reign==
Philip maintained most of his father&#x27;s domestic policies. This included the royal ordinances passed against seigneurial warfare by his father in 1258, which he reinforced by passing his own ordinance in October 1274. Philip followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps concerning Jews in France, claiming piety as his motivation. Upon his return to Paris 23 September 1271, Philip reenacted his father&#x27;s order that Jews wear badges. His charter in 1283 banned the construction and repair of synagogues and Jewish cemeteries, banned Jews from employing Christians, and sought to restrain Jewish &quot;strepiti&quot; (chanting too loudly).

On 21 August 1271, Philip&#x27;s uncle, Alphonse, Count of Poitiers and Toulouse, died childless in Savona. Philip inherited Alphonse&#x27;s lands and united them with the royal domain. This inheritance included a portion of Auvergne, later the Duchy of Auvergne and the Agenais. In accordance with the wishes of Alphonse, Philip granted the Comtat Venaissin to Pope Gregory X in 1274. Several years later the Treaty of Amiens (1279) with King Edward I restored Agenais to the English.

On 19 September 1271, Philip commanded the Seneschal of Toulouse to record oaths of loyalty from nobles and town councils. The following year, Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix, invaded the County of Toulouse, killed several royal officials, and captured the town of Sombuy. Philip&#x27;s royal seneschal, Eustache de Beaumarchès, led a counter-attack into the County of Foix, until ordered by Philip to withdraw. Philip and his army arrived at Toulouse on 25 May 1272, and on 1 June at Boulbonne met James I of Aragon, who attempted to mediate the issue, but this was rejected by Roger-Bernard. Philip then proceeded on a campaign to devastate and depopulate the County of Foix. By 5 June Roger-Bernard had surrendered, was incarcerated at Carcassonne, and placed in chains. Philip imprisoned him for a year, but then freed him and restored his lands.

==Treaty with Navarre==
Following the death of King Henry I of Navarre in 1274, Alfonso X of Castile attempted to gain the crown of Navarre from Henry&#x27;s heiress, Joan. Ferdinand de la Cerda, the son of Alfonso X, arrived at Viana with an army. At the same time, Alfonso sought papal approval for a marriage between one of his grandsons and Joan. Henry&#x27;s widow, Blanche of Artois, was also receiving marriage proposals for Joan from England and Aragon. Faced with an invading army and foreign proposals, Blanche sought assistance from her cousin, Philip. Philip saw a territorial gain, while Joan would have the military assistance to protect her kingdom. The Treaty of Orléans of 1275, between Philip and Blanche, arranged the marriage between a son of Philip (Louis or Philip) and Blanche&#x27;s daughter, Joan. The treaty indicated that Navarre would be administered from Paris by appointed governors. By May 1276, French governors were traveling throughout Navarre collecting oaths of fealty to the young Queen. The Navarrese populace, unhappy with the pro-French treaty and French governors, formed two rebellious factions, one pro-Castilian, the other pro-Aragonese.

===Navarrese revolt===
In September 1276, Philip, faced with open rebellion, sent Robert II, Count of Artois to Pamplona with an army. Philip arrived in Bearn in November 1276 with another army, by which time Robert had pacified the situation and extracted oaths of homage from Navarrese nobles and castellans. Despite the revolt being quickly pacified, it was not until the spring of 1277 that the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon renounced their intentions of matrimony. Philip received a formal rebuke from Pope Nicholas III for the damage inflicted throughout Navarre.

==Sicilian Vespers==

In 1282, Sicily rose in revolt against King Charles I of Naples, Philip&#x27;s uncle. Angered by years of heavy taxation, Sicilian mobs massacred many Angevins and French. King Peter III of Aragon subsequently landed on Sicily in support of the rebels, claiming the crown of Sicily for himself. The success of the rebellion and invasion led to the coronation of Peter as king of Sicily on 4 September 1282. Pope Martin IV excommunicated Peter and declared his kingdom forfeit. Martin then granted Aragon to Philip&#x27;s son, Charles, Count of Valois. Philip&#x27;s brother, Peter, Count of Perche, who had joined Charles to suppress the rebellion, was killed in Reggio Calabria. He died without issue and the County of Alençon returned to the royal domain in 1286.

===Aragonese Crusade and death===

Philip, at the urging of his wife, Marie of Brabant, and his uncle, Charles of Naples, launched a war against the Kingdom of Aragon. The war took the name &quot;Aragonese Crusade&quot; from its papal sanction; nevertheless, one historian labelled it &quot;perhaps the most unjust, unnecessary and calamitous enterprise ever undertaken by the Capetian monarchy.&quot; Philip, accompanied by his sons, entered Roussillon at the head of a large army. By 26 June 1285, he had entrenched his army before Girona and besieged the city. Despite strong resistance, Philip took Girona on 7 September 1285.
Philip quickly experienced a reversal, as an epidemic of dysentery hit the French camp and afflicted Philip personally. The French had started a withdrawal when the Aragonese attacked and easily defeated the former at the Battle of the Col de Panissars on 1 October. Philip died of dysentery in Perpignan on 5 October 1285. His son, Philip the Fair, succeeded him as king of France. Following the &quot;mos Teutonicus&quot; custom, his body was divided in several parts, each buried in different places; the flesh was sent to the Narbonne Cathedral, the entrails to La Noë Abbey in Normandy, his heart to the now-demolished Church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris and his bones to Basilica of Saint-Denis, north of Paris.

==Marriages and children==
On 28 May 1262, Philip married Isabella, daughter of King James I of Aragon and his second wife Violant of Hungary. They had the following children:
#Louis (1264 – May 1276).
#Philip IV of France (1268 – 29 November 1314), his successor, married Joan I of Navarre
#Robert (1269–1271)
#Charles (12 March 1270 – 16 December 1325), Count of Valois from 1284, married first to Margaret of Naples (Countess of Anjou) in 1290, second to Catherine I of Courtenay in 1302, and last to Mahaut of Chatillon in 1308
#Stillborn son (1271)

After the death of Queen Isabella, Philip married on 21 August 1274 Marie, daughter of the late Henry III, Duke of Brabant, and Adelaide of Burgundy, Duchess of Brabant. Their children were:
#Louis (May 1276 – 19 May 1319), Count of Évreux from 1298, married Margaret of Artois
#Blanche (1278 – 19 March 1305, Vienna), married Duke, the future king Rudolf I of Bohemia and Poland, on 25 May 1300.
#Margaret (1282 – 14 February 1318), married King Edward I of England on 8 September 1299

==Legacy==
During Philip&#x27;s reign the royal domain expanded, acquiring the County of Guînes in 1281, the County of Toulouse in 1271, the County of Alençon in 1286, the Duchy of Auvergne in 1271, and through the marriage of his son Philip, the Kingdom of Navarre. He largely continued his father&#x27;s policies and left his father&#x27;s administrators in place. His attempt to conquer Aragon nearly bankrupted the French monarchy, causing financial challenges for his successor.

==Review from Dante==
In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the Italian poet Dante envisions the spirit of Philip outside the gates of Purgatory with a number of other contemporary European rulers. Dante does not name Philip directly, but refers to him as &quot;the small-nosed&quot; and &quot;the father of the Pest of France,&quot; a reference to King Philip IV of France.

<text>The Dobson unit (DU) is a unit of measurement of the amount of a trace gas in a vertical column through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. It originated by, and continues to be primarily used in respect to, the study of atmospheric ozone, whose total column amount, usually termed &quot;total ozone&quot;, and sometimes &quot;column abundance&quot;, is dominated by the high concentrations of ozone in the stratospheric ozone layer.

The Dobson unit is defined as the thickness (in units of 10 μm) of that layer of pure gas which would be formed by the total column amount at standard conditions for temperature and pressure (STP). This is sometimes referred to as a &#x27;milli-atmo-centimeter&#x27;. A typical column amount of 300 DU of atmospheric ozone therefore would form a 3 mm layer of pure gas at the surface of the Earth if its temperature and pressure conformed to STP.

The Dobson unit is named after Gordon Dobson, a researcher at the University of Oxford who in the 1920s built the first instrument to measure total ozone from the ground, making use of a double prism monochromator to measure the differential absorption of different bands of solar ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer. This instrument, called the Dobson ozone spectrophotometer, has formed the backbone of the global network for monitoring atmospheric ozone and was the source of the discovery in 1984 of the Antarctic ozone hole.

==Ozone==
NASA uses a baseline value of 220 DU for ozone. This was chosen as the starting point for observations of the Antarctic ozone hole, since values of less than 220 Dobson units were not found before 1979. Also, from direct measurements over Antarctica, a column ozone level of less than 220 Dobson units is a result of the ozone loss from chlorine and bromine compounds.

==Sulfur dioxide==
In addition, Dobson units are often used to describe total column densities of sulfur dioxide, which occurs in the atmosphere in small amounts due to the combustion of fossil fuels, from biological processes releasing dimethyl sulfide, or by natural combustion such as forest fires. Large amounts of sulfur dioxide may be released into the atmosphere as well by volcanic eruptions. The Dobson unit is used to describe total column amounts of sulfur dioxide because it appeared in the early days of ozone remote sensing on ultraviolet satellite instruments (such as TOMS).

==Derivation==

The Dobson unit arises from the ideal gas law

: formula_1

where &quot;P&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are pressure and volume respectively, and &quot;n&quot;, &quot;R&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are the number of moles of gas, the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)), and &quot;T&quot; is temperature in kelvins (K).

The number density of air is the number of molecules or atoms per unit volume:

: formula_2

and when plugged into the real gas law, the number density of air is found by using pressure, temperature and the real gas constant:

: formula_3

The number density (molecules/volume) of air at standard temperature and pressure (&quot;T&quot; = 273 K and &quot;P&quot; = 101325 Pa) is, by using this equation,

: formula_4

With some unit conversions of joules to pascal cubic meters, the equation for molecules/volume is

:formula_5

A Dobson unit is the total amount of a trace gas per unit area. In atmospheric sciences, this is referred to as a column density. How, though, are units of molecules per &quot;cubic&quot; meter, a volume, to be converted to molecules per &quot;square centimeter&quot;, an area? This must be done by integration. To get the column density, integrate the total column over a height. Per the definition of Dobson units, 1 DU = 0.01 mm of trace gas when compressed down to sea level at standard temperature and pressure. So integrating the number density of air from 0 to 0.01 mm, it becomes equal to 1 DU:

:formula_6
::formula_7

Thus the value of 1 DU is 2.69 molecules per meter squared.

<doc id="78442" wikidata="Q640492" url="?curid=78442" title="Digital elevation model">
<text>A digital elevation model (DEM) or digital surface model (DSM) is a 3D computer graphics representation of elevation data to represent terrain or overlaying objects, commonly of a planet, moon, or asteroid. A &quot;global DEM&quot; refers to a discrete global grid. DEMs are used often in geographic information systems (GIS), and are the most common basis for digitally produced relief maps. 
A digital terrain model (DTM) represents specifically the ground surface while DEM and DSM may represent tree top canopy or building roofs.

While a DSM may be useful for landscape modeling, city modeling and visualization applications, a DTM is often required for flood or drainage modeling, land-use studies, geological applications, and other applications, and in planetary science.

== Terminology ==
There is no universal usage of the terms &quot;digital elevation model&quot; (DEM), &quot;digital terrain model&quot; (DTM) and &quot;digital surface model&quot; (DSM) in scientific literature. In most cases the term &quot;digital surface model&quot; represents the earth&#x27;s surface and includes all objects on it. In contrast to a DSM, the &quot;digital terrain model&quot; (DTM) represents the bare ground surface without any objects like plants and buildings (see the figure on the right).

DEM is often used as a generic term for DSMs and DTMs, only representing height information without any further definition about the surface. 
Other definitions equalise the terms DEM and DTM, equalise the terms DEM and DSM, 
define the DEM as a subset of the DTM, which also represents other morphological elements, or define a DEM as a rectangular grid and a DTM as a three-dimensional model (TIN). 
Most of the data providers (USGS, ERSDAC, CGIAR, Spot Image) use the term DEM as a generic term for DSMs and DTMs. Some datasets such as SRTM or the ASTER GDEM are originally DSMs, although in forested areas, SRTM reaches into the tree canopy giving readings somewhere between a DSM and a DTM). DTMs are created from high resolution DSM datasets using complex algorithms to filter out buildings and other objects, a process known as &quot;bare-earth extraction&quot;.
In the following, the term DEM is used as a generic term for DSMs and DTMs.

==Types==

A DEM can be represented as a raster (a grid of squares, also known as a heightmap when representing elevation) or as a vector-based triangular irregular network (TIN). The TIN DEM dataset is also referred to as a primary (measured) DEM, whereas the Raster DEM is referred to as a secondary (computed) DEM. The DEM could be acquired through techniques such as photogrammetry, lidar, IfSAR or InSAR, land surveying, etc. (Li et al. 2005).

DEMs are commonly built using data collected using remote sensing techniques, but they may also be built from land surveying.

===Rendering===
The digital elevation model itself consists of a matrix of numbers, but the data from a DEM is often rendered in visual form to make it understandable to humans. This visualization may be in the form of a contoured topographic map, or could use shading and false color assignment (or &quot;pseudo-color&quot;) to render elevations as colors (for example, using green for the lowest elevations, shading to red, with white for the highest elevation.).

Visualizations are sometimes also done as oblique views, reconstructing a synthetic visual image of the terrain as it would appear looking down at an angle. In these oblique visualizations, elevations are sometimes scaled using &quot;vertical exaggeration&quot; in order to make subtle elevation differences more noticeable. Some scientists,
 however, object to vertical exaggeration as misleading the viewer about the true landscape.

==Production==
Mappers may prepare digital elevation models in a number of ways, but they frequently use remote sensing rather than direct survey data.

Older methods of generating DEMs often involve interpolating digital contour maps that may have been produced by direct survey of the land surface. This method is still used in mountain areas, where interferometry is not always satisfactory. Note that contour line data or any other sampled elevation datasets (by GPS or ground survey) are not DEMs, but may be considered digital terrain models. A DEM implies that elevation is available continuously at each location in the study area.

===Satellite mapping===
One powerful technique for generating digital elevation models is interferometric synthetic aperture radar where two passes of a radar satellite (such as RADARSAT-1 or TerraSAR-X or Cosmo SkyMed), or a single pass if the satellite is equipped with two antennas (like the SRTM instrumentation), collect sufficient data to generate a digital elevation map tens of kilometers on a side with a resolution of around ten meters. Other kinds of stereoscopic pairs can be employed using the digital image correlation method, where two optical images are acquired with different angles taken from the same pass of an airplane or an Earth Observation Satellite (such as the HRS instrument of SPOT5 or the VNIR band of ASTER).

The SPOT 1 satellite (1986) provided the first usable elevation data for a sizeable portion of the planet&#x27;s landmass, using two-pass stereoscopic correlation. Later, further data were provided by the European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS, 1991) using the same method, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM, 2000) using single-pass SAR and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER, 2000) instrumentation on the Terra satellite using double-pass stereo pairs.

The HRS instrument on SPOT 5 has acquired over 100 million square kilometers of stereo pairs.

===Planetary mapping===

A tool of increasing value in planetary science has been use of orbital altimetry used to make digital elevation map of planets. A primary tool for this is laser altimetry but radar altimetry is also used. Planetary digital elevation maps made using laser altimetry include the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) mapping of Mars, the Lunar Orbital Laser Altimeter (LOLA) and Lunar Altimeter (LALT) mapping of the Moon, and the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) mapping of Mercury. In planetary mapping, each planetary body has a unique reference surface. New Horizons&#x27; Long Range Reconnaissance Imager used stereo photogrammetry to produce partial surface elevation maps of Pluto and 486958 Arrokoth.

===Methods for obtaining elevation data used to create DEMs===

* Lidar
* Radar
* Stereo photogrammetry from aerial surveys
** Structure from motion / Multi-view stereo applied to aerial photography
* Block adjustment from optical satellite imagery
* Interferometry from radar data
* Real Time Kinematic GPS
* Topographic maps
* Theodolite or total station
* Doppler radar
* Focus variation
* Inertial surveys
* Surveying and mapping drones
* Range imaging

===Accuracy===

The quality of a DEM is a measure of how accurate elevation is at each pixel (absolute accuracy) and how accurately is the morphology presented (relative accuracy). Quality assessment of DEM can be performed by comparison of DEMs from different sources. Several factors play an important role for quality of DEM-derived products: 
*terrain roughness;
*sampling density (elevation data collection method);
*grid resolution or pixel size;
*interpolation algorithm;
*vertical resolution;
*terrain analysis algorithm;
*Reference 3D products include quality masks that give information on the coastline, lake, snow, clouds, correlation etc.

==Uses==




Common uses of DEMs include:
* Extracting terrain parameters for geomorphology
* Modeling water flow for hydrology or mass movement (for example avalanches and landslides)
* Modeling soils wetness with Cartographic Depth to Water Indexes (DTW-index)
* Creation of relief maps
* Rendering of 3D visualizations.
* 3D flight planning and TERCOM
* Creation of physical models (including raised relief maps and 3D printed terrain models)
* Rectification of aerial photography or satellite imagery
* Reduction (terrain correction) of gravity measurements (gravimetry, physical geodesy)
* Terrain analysis in geomorphology and physical geography
* Geographic information systems (GIS)
* Engineering and infrastructure design
* Satellite navigation (for example GPS and GLONASS)
* Line-of-sight analysis
* Base mapping
* Flight simulation
* Train simulation
* Precision farming and forestry
* Surface analysis
* Intelligent transportation systems (ITS)
* Auto safety / advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)
* Archaeology

=== Global ===
Released at the beginning of 2022, FABDEM offers a bare earth simulation of the Earth&#x27;s surface at 30 arc-second resolution. Adapted from GLO-30, the data removes all forests and buildings. The data is free to download non-commercially and through the developer&#x27;s website at a cost commercially.

An alternative free global DEM is called GTOPO30 (30 arcsecond resolution, c. 1 km along the equator) is available, but its quality is variable and in some areas it is very poor. A much higher quality DEM from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument of the Terra satellite is also freely available for 99% of the globe, and represents elevation at 30 meter resolution. A similarly high resolution was previously only available for the United States territory under the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, while most of the rest of the planet was only covered in a 3 arc-second resolution (around 90 meters along the equator). SRTM does not cover the polar regions and has mountain and desert no data (void) areas. SRTM data, being derived from radar, represents the elevation of the first-reflected surface—quite often tree tops. So, the data are not necessarily representative of the ground surface, but the top of whatever is first encountered by the radar.

Submarine elevation (known as bathymetry) data is generated using ship-mounted depth soundings. When land topography and bathymetry is combined, a truly global relief model is obtained. The SRTM30Plus dataset (used in NASA World Wind) attempts to combine GTOPO30, SRTM and bathymetric data to produce a truly global elevation model. The Earth2014 global topography and relief model provides layered topography grids at 1 arc-minute resolution. Other than SRTM30plus, Earth2014 provides information on ice-sheet heights and bedrock (that is, topography below the ice) over Antarctica and Greenland. Another global model is Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010) with 7.5 arc second resolution. It is based on SRTM data and combines other data outside SRTM coverage. A novel global DEM of postings lower than 12 m and a height accuracy of less than 2 m is expected from the TanDEM-X satellite mission which started in July 2010.

The most common grid (raster) spacing is between 50 and 500 meters. In gravimetry e.g., the primary grid may be 50 m, but is switched to 100 or 500 meters in distances of about 5 or 10 kilometers.

Since 2002, the HRS instrument on SPOT 5 has acquired over 100 million square kilometers of stereo pairs used to produce a DTED2 format DEM (with a 30-meter posting) DEM format DTED2 over 50 million km2. The radar satellite RADARSAT-2 has been used by MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. to provide DEMs for commercial and military customers.

In 2014, acquisitions from radar satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X will be available in the form of a uniform global coverage with a resolution of 12 meters.

ALOS provides since 2016 a global 1-arc second DSM free of charge, and a commercial 5 meter DSM/DTM.

=== Local ===
Many national mapping agencies produce their own DEMs, often of a higher resolution and quality, but frequently these have to be purchased, and the cost is usually prohibitive to all except public authorities and large corporations. DEMs are often a product of national lidar dataset programs.

Free DEMs are also available for Mars: the MEGDR, or Mission Experiment Gridded Data Record, from the Mars Global Surveyor&#x27;s Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) instrument; and NASA&#x27;s Mars Digital Terrain Model (DTM).

<text>The Mountain West Conference (MW) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States, participating in NCAA Division I. Its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). The MW officially began operations on January 4, 1999. Geographically, the MW covers a broad expanse of the Western United States, with member schools located in California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, and Hawaii. Gloria Nevarez took over as commissioner of the MW on January 1, 2023, following the retirement of founding commissioner Craig Thompson.

The charter members of the MW included the United States Air Force Academy, Brigham Young University, Colorado State University, San Diego State University, the University of New Mexico, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, University of Utah and the University of Wyoming. Before forming the Mountain West Conference, seven of its eight charter members had been longtime members of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) and half of these had been charter members of that conference from 1962. Overall, each school that has ever been either a full or football-only member of the MW spent at least three years in the WAC before joining the Mountain West.

==History==


===Genesis===
The creation of the MW was a delayed aftereffect of the 1996 NCAA conference realignment, which had initially been triggered two years earlier when the Big Eight Conference agreed to merge with four members of the Southwest Conference (SWC) to create the Big 12 Conference, which would begin competition in the 1996–97 school year.

The Western Athletic Conference, which had initially announced plans to expand beyond its then-current 10 members to at least 12, ended up with even more potential expansion prospects. Ultimately, the WAC took in three of the four SWC schools left out of the Big 12 merger—Rice University, Southern Methodist University (SMU), and Texas Christian University (TCU). Three other schools were added to bring the total membership to 16, namely Big West Conference members San José State University and UNLV, plus the University of Tulsa, an NCAA football independent and otherwise a member of the Missouri Valley Conference. The WAC&#x27;s 16 teams were divided into four four-team &quot;quadrants&quot;, two of which rotated between the Mountain and Pacific Divisions every two years. However, the newly expanded WAC was soon wracked by tension between the established and new members.

In spring of 1998, BYU and Utah proposed a permanent split into two eight-team divisions. The proposal would have forced some schools into an unnatural alignment because of the geographic distribution of the conference. Air Force was the most strident opponent of this proposal, threatening to become an independent. Soon after the proposal by BYU and Utah, the presidents of Air Force, BYU, Colorado State, Utah, and Wyoming met at Denver International Airport to discuss their future, and they agreed to break away from the WAC to form a new conference. They invited the WAC members New Mexico, San Diego State, and UNLV to join them in what became the Mountain West Conference.

The next move for the MW came in 2005, when the conference added TCU, who had spent the previous four seasons in Conference USA (C-USA).

===Early–2010s realignment===

On June 11, 2010, Boise State University agreed to join the conference as its tenth member. On June 17, 2010, Utah announced it would be leaving the Mountain West to join what would become the Pac-12 Conference. On August 18, 2010, amidst rumors that BYU was considering leaving the Mountain West to go independent in football and rejoin the Western Athletic Conference in all other sports, the Mountain West Conference officially extended invitations to California State University, Fresno (Fresno State) and the University of Nevada, Reno (Nevada). Both schools accepted and would become the tenth and eleventh members of the league. BYU announced on August 31, 2010, that it would leave the Mountain West Conference and go Independent in football and become a member of the West Coast Conference (WCC) in other sports starting in 2011. On November 29, 2010, TCU announced all athletic teams would move to the Big East Conference effective in 2012. (Less than a year later, on October 10, 2011, TCU announced it would not join the Big East but would join the Big 12, home to fellow former SWC members Baylor, Texas, Texas Tech, and formerly Texas A&amp;M, in 2012 instead.) On December 10, 2010, the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa accepted a bid to become the 10th member of the conference for football only. These changes would leave the Mountain West Conference with 10 teams for the 2012 football season.

During the era of football&#x27;s Bowl Championship Series (BCS), which was replaced by the College Football Playoff (CFP) in 2014, the MW champion qualified for a BCS bowl four times after the BCS formula was tweaked to allow teams from non-BCS conferences to play in BCS bowls if ranked in the top 12. However, two of the three schools that qualified are no longer with the conference.

On October 14, 2011, the Mountain West and C-USA announced a plan for a football only alliance. On February 13, 2012, the two leagues announced that both conferences would be dissolving after the 2012–13 season to reform into one conference with at least 15 members for all sports, and a 16th team, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa as a football-only member. However, when the two conferences discussed their plans with the NCAA, they were told that due to NCAA rules, they would forfeit substantial revenues. Specifically, the new conference would receive only one automatic bid to NCAA championships; at least one of the former conferences would lose future revenue distributions from the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament; and at least one former conference would not be able to collect exit fees from any members that departed to join the new conference. As a result, the Mountain West and C-USA backed away from a full merger. In late March of that year, the commissioners of both conferences stated that all 16 schools had entered into binding agreements to form a new &quot;association&quot;, although the Mountain West and C-USA would have apparently remained separate legal entities. In the end, this alliance never materialized due to both conferences soon adding new teams.

On May 2, 2012, San José State and Utah State agreed to join the conference for the 2013–14 academic year. On December 31 of that year, Boise State announced that it had backed out of its previously announced move to the Big East for football and the Big West for other sports, and would remain in the MW.

On January 16, 2013, San Diego State accepted an offer to remain/return to the Mountain West Conference in all sports. Keeping SDSU in the conference gave the Mountain West 12 football members, allowing for a Championship Game to be held. The first championship game took place on December 7, 2013.

===Further membership changes===
In February 2018, &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; reported that the MW was looking to expand in the near future. In the report, commissioner Craig Thompson revealed that the conference had discussed expansion with six schools, with WCC member Gonzaga (which has not sponsored football since World War II) the only school mentioned by name. Thompson added that Gonzaga could potentially join the MW as a full but non-football member as early as July 2018. While Thompson said that BYU had not contacted the conference, the report indicated that BYU would be open to an MW return, at least in non-football sports, should Gonzaga join. A later &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; report indicated that talks were advanced enough that the conference&#x27;s presidents planned a vote on an invitation to Gonzaga during the MW men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournaments in Las Vegas, but decided to delay the vote until after the Final Four. However, on April 2, the day of the Division I men&#x27;s title game, Gonzaga athletic director Mike Roth notified the MW, the WCC, and media that the school would remain in the WCC for the immediate future.

On June 30, 2022, UCLA and Southern Cal announced their departure from the Pac-12 Conference to the Big Ten Conference beginning in the 2024–25 academic year. After that announcement, San Diego State had been considered one of the top candidates for Pac-12 expansion. On June 16, 2023, Pete Thamel of ESPN reported that San Diego State had given the Mountain West Conference notice that the school would be departing from the conference and asked for an extension for the departure deadline of July 1, 2023, to avoid paying extra exit fees. The Mountain West Conference denied the request for a deadline extension and considered the letter from San Diego State as a formal notice of departure and began to proceed with the separation process; however, San Diego State disputed that its letter of intent was a formal notice. On June 30, 2023, with the Pac-12 still lacking a media rights agreement for 2024–25, ESPN reported that San Diego State would remain in the Mountain West Conference, rescinding the intention to withdraw from the conference. The MW and San Diego State reached a settlement of their dispute the following month, with SDSU remaining a member for the immediate future.

In September 2023, after a mass exodus from the Pac-12 left Oregon State and Washington State as its only remaining members, MW commissioner Gloria Nevarez began discussions with the two schools regarding various options for partnership, affiliation, or merger. On December 1, 2023, the conference announced that it would enter into a football scheduling agreement with the two schools for the 2024 season. All 12 Mountain West members will play one game against either Oregon State or Washington State next season, giving both schools three home games and three away games. These games will not count towards Mountain West conference standings, and Oregon State and Washington State will remain members of the Pac-12. On April 16, 2024, it was also announced that Washington State would be joining the MW as an affiliate for baseball and women&#x27;s swimming.

On September 12, 2024, it was announced that Boise State, Fresno State, Colorado State, and San Diego State would be leaving the MW and joining the Pac-12 in 2026. On September 23, Utah State also accepted an offer to join the Pac-12 in 2026 as its seventh member.

On October 1, 2024 it was announced that the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) will be joining the Mountain West starting in the 2026–27 academic year. On October 14, Craig Angelos, athletic director of football-only member Hawaii, confirmed outside reports that the school would upgrade to full MW membership in 2026. This move was officially announced the next day. On November 1, 2024, Grand Canyon University announced it was joining the Mountain West no later than July 1, 2026.

On December 10, 2024 it was announced that UC Davis would join the Mountain West Conference in all sports except football, for which it will remain in the Big Sky Conference. This move is expected on July 1, 2026.

On January 3, 2025, Northern Illinois University accepted an invitation from the MW to join for football only in 2026. The move became official on January 7, after approval by NIU&#x27;s governing board.

==Athletic department revenue by school==
Total revenue includes ticket sales, contributions and donations, rights and licensing, student fees, school funds and all other sources including TV income, camp income, concessions, and novelties.

Total expenses includes coach and staff salaries, scholarships, buildings and grounds, maintenance, utilities and rental fees, recruiting, team travel, equipment and uniforms, conference dues, and insurance.

The following table shows institutional reporting to the United States Department of Education as shown on the DOE Equity in Athletics website for the 2021–22 academic year. However, since Air Force is not available from that source, it was obtained from Knight Commission for the 2020–2021 academic year.

===Divisions===

Beginning in 2013, the conference split into two divisions, named the &quot;Mountain Division&quot; and &quot;West Division,&quot; of six teams each for football. The Mountain West also added a conference championship game, pitting the winners of the two divisions. This first championship game took place on December 7, 2013, at Bulldog Stadium in Fresno, California, the home stadium of Fresno State, the divisional winner with the higher BCS ranking. Each team played five divisional games and three cross-divisional contests annually.
The 2015 championship game featured the Air Force Academy Falcons against the San Diego State University Aztecs. The 2016 championship game featured the San Diego State University Aztecs against the University of Wyoming Cowboys.

On May 20, 2022, the conference approved a new football schedule format, set to take effect in the 2023 season. Under this format, the conference will remove divisions, and instead play a 2–6 format, where each team plays 2 designated rivals every year along with six separate 6-team rotations that flip every other year, such that every team will have at least one home game and one away game against every other team in a three-year cycle (less than the standard length of a college player&#x27;s career). The MW Championship will also no longer be determined by the winners of the two divisions; the two teams with the highest conference winning percentage will play instead. The designated rivals under this system are as follows:

Prior to this, the division format was as follows:
* No other MW sport is split into divisions—including women&#x27;s soccer, the only other conference sport with 12 competing schools (with Colorado College as the 12th member).

===Bowl games===
The Mountain West Conference has agreements with six bowls.

Since the 2014 season, the Mountain West champion is eligible for an at-large berth in the Cotton Bowl Classic, Fiesta Bowl, or Peach Bowl, if it is the highest-ranked conference champion among the &quot;Group of Five&quot; conferences (which also includes The American, CUSA, MAC, and Sun Belt) in the final College Football Playoff rankings, if it is not in the top 4. In the 2014 season, Boise State became the first team to receive this berth, being selected for and winning the Fiesta Bowl.

As of 2020,
* If Hawaii is bowl eligible and not MW champions or selected for a CFP bowl, they will receive a berth in the Hawaii Bowl.
** The MW will only send a team to the Cactus or San Francisco Bowls if one of the primary conferences affiliated with those bowls is unable to fill their slots.

===Bowl records===


===Bowl Challenge Cup===
ESPN created the Bowl Challenge Cup in 2002 for the conference that had the best college football bowl record among Division I Football Bowl Subdivision conferences. The conference has won it five times, more than any other conference, by finishing with bowl game records of 2–1 in 2004–05, 4–1 in 2007–08, 4–1 in 2009–10, 4–1 in 2010–11 and 5–1 in 2021–22.

==Men&#x27;s basketball==
The Mountain West and Missouri Valley Conferences hold an annual challenge series that was renewed in the 2015–16 season after a two-year hiatus. The series began in the 2009–10 season but temporarily ended when the original contract ran out after the 2012–13 season, During the first four seasons of the series, it involved all members of the MW and an equal number of the 10 MVC teams in basketball. With the MW now having 11 basketball members to the MVC&#x27;s 10, the renewed series involves all MVC teams, with one MW team sitting out.

The first game was on November 13, 2009, featuring the Bradley Braves and the BYU Cougars in Provo and it concluded on December 23 with the Wyoming Cowboys visiting the Northern Iowa Panthers in Cedar Falls, Iowa. The challenge is similar to the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, which pits men&#x27;s basketball teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Big Ten Conference.

;Notes
==Elevation==
The Mountain West&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Above the rest&quot;, and over half of the member institutions, plus women&#x27;s soccer-only member Colorado College, are at more than above sea level. This impacts endurance in sports like football, soccer, and the distance races in track &amp; field and swimming meets; air resistance in sprints and horizontal jumps in track &amp; field; and aerodynamics in baseball, softball, tennis, golf, and the discus and javelin throws. The Mountain West&#x27;s institutions have the highest average elevations in NCAA Division I sports.

===Campus and football stadium elevations===
Schools in &quot;italics&quot; are single-sport members. In the case of women&#x27;s soccer-only member Colorado College, &quot;stadium elevation&quot; refers to the school&#x27;s soccer venue.

<text>Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, KG (1516/1517–19 January 1547) was an English nobleman, politician and poet. He was one of the founders of English Renaissance poetry and was the last known person to have been executed at the insistence of King Henry VIII. His name is usually associated in literature with that of the poet Sir Thomas Wyatt. Owing largely to the powerful position of his father Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, Henry took a prominent part in court life, and served as a soldier both in France and in Scotland. He was a man of reckless temper, which involved him in many quarrels, and finally brought upon him the wrath of the ageing Henry VIII. He was arrested, tried for treason and beheaded on Tower Hill.

==Origins==

Henry was born in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, being the eldest of five children of Thomas Howard, then Earl of Surrey, and his second wife Lady Elizabeth Stafford. His paternal grandparents were Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk and Lady Elizabeth Tilney, and his maternal grandparents were Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Lady Eleanor Percy. Her younger siblings were Katherine, born 1518, Mary, born 1519, Thomas, born 1520 and Muriel, born in 1521. On his father&#x27;s side, he was a first cousin of Mary, George and Anne Boleyn, as well as Catherine Howard. Both Anne and Catherine would become wives of King Henry VIII. At the time of his birth, his father&#x27;s political career was on the rise, fuelled in large part by the powerful position of Henry&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. The Dukes of Norfolk and Buckingham (Henry&#x27;s grandparents), along with Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk were the three most powerful peers in the Kingdom. Following Stafford&#x27;s fall from grace and execution in May 1521, Norfolk and Brandon remained the sole dukes of England.

Howard received a careful education from the best tutors of the time; as a young boy he was making translations from Latin, Italian and Spanish into English. Howard has been described as a &quot;reckless, arrogant man&quot;, being very different from the rest of the family: &quot;Most early sixteenth century Howards were dull dogs: hard, hard-nosed and dourly efficient. Howard was quite different. There was something in him of his paternal uncle, the Admiral Edward Howard, killed in action against the French in April 1513. There was more, however, of the darker inheritance of his maternal grandfather, the Duke of Buckingham. Howard inherited all Stafford&#x27;s grand pride in blood and aristocracy, and all his determination that noblemen should once more come into their own. Perhaps it was from his mother&#x27;s side too that he got his most dangerous trait: a rashness and a violence that bordered on madness. He also had a great intelligence that was both penetrating and fast and the result was one of the most remarkable men of the age&quot;.

==Career==
He was brought up at Windsor Castle with Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond and Somerset, the illegitimate son of Henry VIII. He became a close friend, and later a brother-in-law of Fitzroy, following Fitzroy&#x27;s marriage to his sister Mary. Like his father and grandfather, he was a soldier, serving in Henry VIII&#x27;s French wars as Lieutenant General of the King on Sea and Land.

Howard was repeatedly imprisoned for rash behaviour: on one occasion for striking a courtier, and on another for wandering through the streets of London breaking the windows of houses whose occupants were asleep. He assumed the courtesy title of Earl of Surrey in May 1524 when his grandfather died and his father became Duke of Norfolk. Being the eldest son and heir to the 3rd Duke, Surrey was destined to be the future 4th Duke.

In 1532 he accompanied Anne Boleyn (his first cousin), King Henry VIII, and the Duke of Richmond on their visit to France, and remained there for more than a year as a member of the entourage of King Francis I of France. Surrey returned to England in the autumn of 1533, when Richmond&#x27;s marriage to Mary Howard, Surrey&#x27;s sister, took place. At the same time, his parents&#x27; marriage was in difficulties due to Norfolk&#x27;s extramarital relationship with Bess Holland. Surrey took his father&#x27;s side in the family dispute, and remained at Kenninghall, where his wife joined him in 1535. On 10 March 1536, Surrey’s eldest son Thomas was born.

In May 1536 both Surrey and his father were obliged to take leading roles in the trial of their relations Anne Boleyn and her brother, the Viscount Rochford. They were tried in the great hall of the Tower. Norfolk presided over the trial as Lord High Steward; Surrey sat below him as Earl Marshal. In July, Surrey&#x27;s brother-in-law the Duke of Richmond died at the age of 17 and was buried at Thetford Priory, one of the Howard properties. In October, Surrey accompanied his father in the suppression of the Pilgrimage of Grace, a Catholic rebellion which had broken out in the north of England against the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Religiously, Surrey had reformist leanings but was Roman Catholic like his father, who was the premier Catholic nobleman of England. The Howards remained loyal to Catholicism during the Reformation. Surrey was educated and raised in the traditional religion and one of the causes of his fall from grace was his Catholicism. Years later, his eldest son Thomas would also fall from favour and be executed for having conspired against Queen Elizabeth I with the intention of replacing her with Mary, Queen of Scots and thus restore Catholicism to England.

==Marriage and progeny==


In the early 1530s, Anne Boleyn, Surrey&#x27;s first cousin, promoted a marriage between him and Princess Mary, the King&#x27;s only surviving daughter with his wife Catherine of Aragon. The Duke of Norfolk was very enthusiastic about the match as it might give him greater political influence and put his family closer to the throne of England. Boleyn may have considered the match to be a way of neutralising the threat Mary posed to the succession of any children Anne might have by the King. But she changed her mind, fearing that the Duke could use the match to support Mary&#x27;s claim to the throne and support Catherine of Aragon in the divorce proceedings which were still continuing. By October 1530, Boleyn persuaded her reluctant uncle to arrange instead for Surrey to marry Frances de Vere, one of the daughters of John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford with his second wife, Elizabeth Trussell.

On 15 January 1532, Norfolk and Oxford agreed the marriage contract. Frances would receive an amount of 4,000 marks, of which 200 was received upon her marriage and the rest would be received in instalments. Frances would retain this entitlement in the event of her husband&#x27;s death. Norfolk gave the couple land that would produce an annual income of £300. The contract was signed a month later, on 13 February.

The wedding took place on 23 April, although due to the couple&#x27;s young age, they did not begin to live together until 1535. Although the marriage was celebrated according to Catholic rites, there were religious differences between the families: Frances&#x27;s father was a supporter of the Reformation and was the first Protestant Earl of Oxford, whereas Surrey&#x27;s father was the premier Catholic nobleman of England. Surrey&#x27;s father-in-law, the Earl of Oxford, was the holder of the second oldest extant earldom in England and was the Lord Great Chamberlain.

Surrey had with his wife two sons and three daughters:
* Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, who on his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1554 inherited the Dukedom of Norfolk. He was married three times: (1) Mary FitzAlan (2) Margaret Audley (3) Elizabeth Leyburne.
* Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, who died unmarried.
* Jane Howard, who married Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland.
* Katherine Howard, who married Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley.
* Margaret Howard, who married Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton. She was born shortly after her father&#x27;s execution.

==Downfall and death==
The Howards had little regard for the &quot;new men&quot; who had risen to power at court, such as Thomas Cromwell and the Seymour family. Surrey was less circumspect than his father in concealing this disdain. The Howards had many enemies at court. Howard himself branded Cromwell a &quot;foul churl&quot; and William Paget a &quot;mean creature&quot; as well as arguing that &quot;These new erected men would by their wills leave no nobleman on life!&quot; Norfolk&#x27;s political intriguing against Cromwell took advantage of the King&#x27;s failed marriage to Anne of Cleves, of which Cromwell was the main promoter, and led to the latter&#x27;s fall from grace and execution in July 1540. During the last years of Henry VIII&#x27;s reign, the Seymours, and the King&#x27;s last wife, Catherine Parr, supporters of Protestantism, gained greater power and influence at court while the Howards, who were conservatives, were left politically isolated. Norfolk attempted to form an alliance with the Seymours through marriage of his daughter Mary to Thomas Seymour, but such efforts were in vain due to Surrey&#x27;s provocative behavior.

Henry VIII, who was becoming increasingly ill, became convinced that the Howards were planning to usurp the Crown from his son, Prince Edward. Surrey suggested that his widowed sister Mary should seduce the ageing king, her father-in-law, and become his mistress, to &quot;wield as much influence on him as Madame d&#x27;Etampes doth about the French King&quot;. Mary, outraged, said she would &quot;cut her own throat&quot; rather than &quot;consent to such villainy&quot;. 

She and her brother therefore fell out, and Mary later gave testimony against Henry that helped lead to his trial and execution for treason. Surrey&#x27;s family, including his mother, his sister Mary, and Bess Holland, his father&#x27;s mistress, testified against both Surrey and the Duke. The matter came to a head when Surrey quartered the royal arms of Edward the Confessor on his own coat of arms. John Barlow had once called Howard &quot;the most foolish proud boy that is in England&quot;. Through his great-grandfather John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk (1483 creation), Surrey was a descendant of Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk, the sixth son of King Edward I, and the arms of the Howard ancestor, Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk (1397 creation), show that Surrey was entitled to bear Edward the Confessor&#x27;s arms, but doing so was an act of pride, and provocative in the eyes of the Crown. Religious reasons were also one of the causes of Surrey&#x27;s fall from grace. Henry VIII, very possibly influenced by the Seymours, supporters of Protestantism, believed that the earl and his father were going to usurp the Crown to reverse the Reformation and thus return the English Church to Roman jurisdiction.

In consequence, the King ordered Howard&#x27;s imprisonment on a charge of treasonably quartering the royal arms, and also that of his father. They were sentenced to death on 13 January 1547. Surrey was executed on 19 January 1547. On 27 January, the Howards, father and son, were attainted by statute. The Duke&#x27;s execution was scheduled for the following day (28 January), but it did not take place because Henry VIII died in the early hours of that day. The Privy Council made a decision not to inaugurate the new reign with bloodshed, but Howard remained a prisoner in the Tower of London for the next six years, with most of his titles and property forfeited to the Crown, until he was released and pardoned in August 1553 upon the accession of the Catholic Queen Mary I. Surrey&#x27;s son Thomas Howard, became heir to the dukedom of Norfolk in place of his father; he inherited the title upon the 3rd Duke&#x27;s death in 1554.

==Burial==


Surrey was first buried in Church of All Hallows in Tower Street, although in 1614 his remains were moved to St Michael the Archangel&#x27;s Church, Framlingham, Suffolk, where his spectacular painted alabaster tomb survives, richly decorated with the coats of arms and heraldic animals of the Howard and De Vere families. The tomb was erected by order of Surrey&#x27;s youngest son, the Earl of Northampton. Lady Frances, Surrey&#x27;s wife, although she was buried at Framlingham after her death in 1577, her remains were subsequently placed alongside those of her husband in the new tomb.

The Latin inscription on the Earl&#x27;s tomb refers to Surrey as being the son of the 2nd Duke of Norfolk, technically a new creation, but treated for all practical purposes as a recreation of the forfeited title held by Surrey&#x27;s great-grandfather, the 1st Duke, therefore both the 2nd and 3rd Duke would be numbered correctly.

Surrey&#x27;s tomb is not a religious example, unlike his father&#x27;s tomb which is richly decorated with religious iconography, but rather extolling the virtues of its subjects. Effigies of his two sons kneel at the foot and at the head his three daughters.

In the 1970s the funerary monument was in very poor state of preservation, sagging in the centre and with the ends collapsing. The restoration of the tomb was entrusted to John Green. During the restoration and cleaning, it was found that there were holes of the dowel where a coronet had once been placed (not worn on the head, since Surrey died in disgrace). A new coronet was made of lead casting with large fish weights for the baubles, painted, gilded, and placed in position.

==Literary activity and legacy==
He and his friend Sir Thomas Wyatt may be considered as followers of the Petrarchism movement within the Renaissance literature. They were the first English poets to write in the sonnet form which Shakespeare later used, and Howard was the first English poet to publish blank verse (unrhymed iambic pentameter) in his translation of the second and fourth books of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. 
Together, Wyatt and Howard, due to their excellent translations of Petrarch&#x27;s sonnets, are known as &quot;Fathers of the English Sonnet&quot;. While Wyatt introduced the sonnet form into English poetry, Howard gave it the rhyming metre and the division into quatrains which characterise the sonnets written in a way variously named English, Elizabethan, or Shakespearean sonnets.

&quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, printed in 1557, contains 40 poems written by Henry Howard. Among the poems ascribed to Surrey is a loose translation of Martial 10:47, as &quot;The means to attain happy life&quot;. A different version is preserved in MS. (Add. 36259). Another version of the translation had been printed ten years earlier in William Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;Treatise of Morall Phylosophie&quot; (January 1547/8).
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;The Things That Cause a Quiet Life&quot; was written by Surrey:

My friend, the things that do attain
The happy life be these, I find:
The riches left, not got with pain,
The fruitful ground; the quiet mind;

The equal friend; no grudge, no strife;
No charge of rule nor governance;
Without disease the healthy life;
The household of continuance;

The mean diet, no dainty fare;
True wisdom joined with simpleness;
The night discharged of all care,
Where wine the wit may not oppress;

The faithful wife, without debate;
Such sleeps as may beguile the night:
Content thyself with thine estate,
Neither wish death, nor fear his might.&lt;/poem&gt;

==In popular culture==
Howard was portrayed by the actor David O&#x27;Hara in &quot;The Tudors&quot;, a television series which ran from 2007 to 2010.

<text>A Doppler radar is a specialized radar that uses the Doppler effect to produce velocity data about objects at a distance. It does this by bouncing a microwave signal off a desired target and analyzing how the object&#x27;s motion has altered the frequency of the returned signal. This variation gives direct and highly accurate measurements of the component of a target&#x27;s velocity relative to the radar. The term applies to radar systems in many domains like aviation, police radar detectors, navigation, meteorology, etc.

== Concept ==

=== Doppler effect ===
The Doppler effect (or Doppler shift), named after Austrian physicist Christian Doppler who proposed it in 1842, is the difference between the observed frequency and the emitted frequency of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the waves. It is commonly heard when a vehicle sounding a siren approaches, passes and recedes from an observer. The received frequency is higher (compared to the emitted frequency) during the approach, it is identical at the instant of passing by, and it is lower during the recession. This variation of frequency also depends on the direction the wave source is moving with respect to the observer; it is maximum when the source is moving directly toward or away from the observer and diminishes with increasing angle between the direction of motion and the direction of the waves, until when the source is moving at right angles to the observer, there is no shift.

Imagine a baseball pitcher throwing one ball every second to a catcher (a frequency of 1 ball per second). Assuming the balls travel at a constant velocity and the pitcher is stationary, the catcher catches one ball every second. However, if the pitcher is jogging towards the catcher, the catcher catches balls more frequently because the balls are less spaced out (the frequency increases). The inverse is true if the pitcher is moving away from the catcher. The catcher catches balls less frequently because of the pitcher&#x27;s backward motion (the frequency decreases). If the pitcher moves at an angle, but at the same speed, the frequency variation at which the receiver catches balls is less, as the distance between the two changes more slowly.

From the point of view of the pitcher, the frequency remains constant (whether he&#x27;s throwing balls or transmitting microwaves). Since with electromagnetic radiation like microwaves or with sound, frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, the wavelength of the waves is also affected. Thus, the relative difference in velocity between a source and an observer is what gives rise to the Doppler effect.

=== Frequency variation ===

The formula for radar Doppler shift is the same as that for reflection of light by a moving mirror. There is no need to invoke Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity, because all observations are made in the same frame of reference. The result derived with &quot;c&quot; as the speed of light and &quot;v&quot; as the target radial velocity gives the shifted frequency (formula_1) as a function of the original frequency (formula_2) :

::formula_3

which simplifies to

::formula_4
The &quot;beat frequency&quot;, (Doppler frequency) (formula_5), is thus:

::formula_6

Since for most practical applications of radar, formula_7, so formula_8. We can then write:

::formula_9

=== Technology ===
There are four ways of producing the Doppler effect. Radars may be:
* Coherent pulsed (CP),
* Pulse-Doppler radar,
* Continuous wave (CW), or
* Frequency modulation (FM).

Doppler allows the use of narrow band receiver filters that reduce or eliminate signals from slow moving and stationary objects. This effectively eliminates false signals produced by trees, clouds, insects, birds, wind, and other environmental influences but various inexpensive hand held Doppler radar devices not using this may produce erroneous measurements.

CW Doppler radar only provides a velocity output as the received signal from the target is compared in frequency with the original signal. Early Doppler radars included CW, but these quickly led to the development of frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar, which sweeps the transmitter frequency to encode and determine range.

With the advent of digital techniques, Pulse-Doppler radars (PD) became light enough for aircraft use, and Doppler processors for coherent pulse radars became more common. That provides Look-down/shoot-down capability. The advantage of combining Doppler processing with pulse radars is to provide accurate velocity information. This velocity is called range-rate. It describes the rate that a target moves toward or away from the radar. A target with no range-rate reflects a frequency near the transmitter frequency and cannot be detected. The classic zero doppler target is one which is on a heading that is tangential to the radar antenna beam. Basically, any target that is heading 90 degrees in relation to the antenna beam cannot be detected by its velocity (only by its conventional reflectivity).

Ultra-wideband waveforms have been investigated by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) as a potential approach to Doppler processing due to its low average power, high resolution, and object-penetrating ability. While investigating the feasibility of whether UWB radar technology can incorporate Doppler processing to estimate the velocity of a moving target when the platform is stationary, a 2013 ARL report highlighted issues related to target range migration. However, researchers have suggested that these issues can be alleviated if the correct matched filter is used.

In military airborne applications, the Doppler effect has 2 main advantages. Firstly, the radar is more robust against counter-measure. Return signals from weather, terrain, and countermeasures like chaff are filtered out before detection, which reduces computer and operator loading in hostile environments. Secondly, against a low altitude target, filtering on the radial speed is a very effective way to eliminate the ground clutter that always has a null speed. Low-flying military plane with countermeasure alert for hostile radar track acquisition can turn perpendicular to the hostile radar to nullify its Doppler frequency, which usually breaks the lock and drives the radar off by hiding against the ground return which is much larger.

== History ==
Doppler radar tends to be lightweight because it eliminates heavy pulse hardware. The associated filtering removes stationary reflections while integrating signals over a longer time span, which improves range performance while reducing power. The military applied these advantages during the 1940s.

Continuous-broadcast, or FM, radar was developed during World War II for United States Navy aircraft, to support night combat operation. Most used the UHF spectrum and had a transmit Yagi antenna on the port wing and a receiver Yagi antenna on the starboard wing. This enabled bombers to fly an optimum speed when approaching ship targets, and let escort fighter aircraft train guns on enemy aircraft during night operation. These strategies were adapted to semi-active radar homing.

In 1951, Carl A. Wiley invented synthetic-aperture radar, which, though distinct from mainstream Doppler radar, was based on Doppler principles, and originally patented as &quot;Pulsed Doppler Radar Methods and Means,&quot; #3,196,436.

Modern Doppler systems are light enough for mobile ground surveillance associated with infantry and surface ships. These detect motion from vehicles and personnel for night and all weather combat operation. Modern police radar guns are a smaller, more portable version of these systems.

Early Doppler radar sets relied on large analog filters to achieve acceptable performance. Analog filters, waveguide, and amplifiers pick up vibration like microphones, so bulky vibration damping is required. That extra weight imposed unacceptable kinematic performance limitations that restricted aircraft use to night operation, heavy weather, and heavy jamming environments until the 1970s.

Digital fast Fourier transform (FFT) filtering became practical when modern microprocessors became available during the 1970s. This was immediately connected to coherent pulsed radars, where velocity information was extracted. This proved useful in both weather and air traffic control radars. The velocity information provided another input to the software tracker, and improved computer tracking. Because of the low pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of most coherent pulsed radars, which maximizes the coverage in range, the amount of Doppler processing is limited. The Doppler processor can only process velocities up to ± the PRF of the radar. This is not a problem for weather radars. Velocity information for aircraft cannot be extracted directly from low-PRF radar because sampling restricts measurements to about 75 miles per hour.

Specialized radars quickly were developed when digital techniques became lightweight and more affordable. Pulse-Doppler radars combine all the benefits of long range and high velocity capability. Pulse-Doppler radars use a medium to high PRF (on the order of 3 to 30 kHz), which allows for the detection of either high-speed targets or high-resolution velocity measurements. Normally it is one or the other; a radar designed for detecting targets from zero to Mach 2 does not have a high resolution in speed, while a radar designed for high-resolution velocity measurements does not have a wide range of speeds. Weather radars are high-resolution velocity radars, while air defense radars have a large range of velocity detection, but the accuracy in velocity is in the tens of knots.

Antenna designs for the CW and FM-CW started out as separate transmit and receive antennas before the advent of affordable microwave designs. In the late 1960s, traffic radars began being produced which used a single antenna. This was made possible by the use of circular polarization and a multi-port waveguide section operating at X band. By the late 1970s this changed to linear polarization and the use of ferrite circulators at both X and K bands. PD radars operate at too high a PRF to use a transmit-receive gas filled switch, and most use solid-state devices to protect the receiver low-noise amplifier when the transmitter is fired.

==Applications==
Doppler radars are used in aviation, sounding satellites, Major League Baseball&#x27;s StatCast system, meteorology, radar guns, radiology and healthcare (fall detection and risk assessment, nursing or clinic purpose), and bistatic radar (surface-to-air missiles).

===Weather===
Partly because of its common use by television meteorologists in on-air weather reporting, the specific term &quot;Doppler Radar&quot; has erroneously become popularly synonymous with the type of radar used in meteorology. Most modern weather radars use the pulse-Doppler technique to examine the motion of precipitation, but it is only a part of the processing of their data. So, while these radars use a highly specialized form of &quot;Doppler radar&quot;, this type of radar is much broader in its meaning and its applications.

The work on the Doppler function for weather radar has a long history in many countries. In June 1958, American researchers David Holmes and Robert Smith were able to detect the rotation of a tornado using the mobile continuous-wave radar (photo to the right). Norman&#x27;s laboratory, which later became the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), modified this radar to make it a pulsed Doppler radar allowing more easily to know the position of the echoes and having a greater power

The work was accelerated after such event in the United States as the 1974 Super Outbreak when 148 tornadoes roared through thirteen states. The reflectivity only radar of the time could only locate the precipitation structure of the thunderclouds but not the mesocyclonic rotation and divergence of winds leading to the development of tornadoes or downbursts. The NSSL Doppler became operational in 1971 and led to the NEXRAD network being deployed at the end of the 1980s.

===Navigation===
Doppler radars were used as a navigation aid for aircraft and spacecraft. By directly measuring the movement of the ground with the radar, and then comparing this to the airspeed returned from the aircraft instruments, the wind speed could be accurately determined for the first time. This value was then used for highly accurate dead reckoning. One early example of such a system was the Green Satin radar used in the English Electric Canberra. This system sent a pulsed signal at a very low repetition rate so it could use a single antenna to transmit and receive. An oscillator held the reference frequency for comparison to the received signal. In practice, the initial &quot;fix&quot; was taken using a radio navigation system, normally Gee, and the Green Satin then provided accurate long-distance navigation beyond Gee&#x27;s 350-mile range. Similar systems were used in a number of aircraft of the era, and were combined with the main search radars of fighter designs by the 1960s.

Doppler navigation was in common commercial aviation use in the 1960s until it was largely superseded by inertial navigation systems. The equipment consisted of a transmitter/receiver unit, a processing unit and a gyro stabilised antenna platform. The antenna generated four beams and was rotated by a servo mechanism to align with the aircraft&#x27;s track by equalising the Doppler shift from the left and right hand antennas. A synchro transmitted the platform angle to the flight deck, thus providing a measure of &#x27;drift angle&#x27;. The ground speed was determined from the Doppler shift between the forward and aft facing beams. These were displayed on the flight deck on single instrument. 
Some aircraft had an additional &#x27;Doppler Computer&#x27;. This was a mechanical device containing a steel ball rotated by a motor whose speed was controlled by the Doppler determined ground speed. The angle of this motor was controlled by the &#x27;drift angle&#x27;. Two fixed wheels, one &#x27;fore and aft&#x27; the other &#x27;left to right&#x27; drove counters to output distance along track and across track difference. The aircraft&#x27;s compass was integrated into the computer so that a desired track could be set between two waypoints on an over water great circle route. It may seem surprising to 21st. century readers, but it actually worked rather well and was great improvement over other &#x27;dead reckoning&#x27; methods available at the time. It was generally backed up with position fixes from Loran, VORs, NDBs, or as a last resort sextant and chronometer. It was possible to cross the Atlantic with an error of a couple of miles when in range of a couple of VORs or NDBs.
Its major shortcoming in practice was the sea state, as a calm sea gave poor radar returns and hence unreliable Doppler measurements. But this was infrequent on the North Atlantic

==== Locus-based navigation ====
Location-based Doppler techniques were also used in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s historical Transit satellite navigation system, with satellite transmitters and ground-based receivers, and are currently used in the civilian Argos system, which uses satellite receivers and ground-based transmitters. In these cases, the ground stations are either stationary or slow-moving, and the Doppler offset being measured is caused by the relative motion between the ground station and the fast-moving satellite. The combination of Doppler offset and reception time can be used to generate a locus of locations that would have the measured offset at that intersects the Earth&#x27;s surface at that moment: by combining this with other loci from measurements at other times, the true location of the ground station can be determined accurately.

==== Unmanned aerial vehicle detection ====
A notable example of utilizing Doppler information is in the detection and classification of small unmanned aerial vehicles. Radar systems operating at extremely high frequency offer enhanced Doppler resolution for a given coherent processing interval. This increased resolution allows access to micro-Doppler signatures (MDSs), where micro-Doppler refers to Doppler modulations caused by the oscillatory movement of a target&#x27;s structural components, in contrast to bulk Doppler, which relates to the overall motion of the target. Typically, UAVs have rotating blades that generate distinctive MDSs, enabling effective target discrimination between UAVs and other airborne objects, such as birds.

<text>Downwelling is the downward movement of a fluid parcel and its properties (e.g., salinity, temperature, pH) within a larger fluid. It is closely related to upwelling, the upward movement of fluid. 

While downwelling is most commonly used to describe an oceanic process, it&#x27;s also used to describe a variety of Earth phenomena. This includes mantle dynamics, air movement, and movement in freshwater systems (e.g., large lakes). This article will focus on oceanic downwelling and its important implications for ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycles. Two primary mechanisms transport water downward: buoyancy forcing and wind-driven Ekman transport (i.e., Ekman pumping).

Downwelling has important implications for marine life. Surface water generally has a lower nutrient content compared to deep water due to primary production using nutrients in the photic zone. Surface water is, however, high in oxygen compared to the deep ocean due to photosynthesis and air-sea gas exchange. When water is moved downwards, oxygen is pumped below the surface, where it is used by decaying organisms. Downwelling events are accompanied by low primary production in the surface ocean due to a lack of nutrient supply from below.
== Mechanisms ==

=== Buoyancy ===
Buoyancy-forced downwelling, often termed convection, is the deepening of a water parcel due to a change in the density of that parcel. Density changes in the surface ocean are primarily the result of evaporation, precipitation, heating, cooling, or the introduction and mixing of an alternate water or salinity source, such as river input or brine rejection. Notably, convection is the driving force behind global thermohaline circulation. For a water parcel to move downward, the density of that parcel must increase; therefore, evaporation, cooling, and brine rejection are the processes that control buoyancy-forced downwelling.

=== Wind-driven Ekman transport ===
Ekman transport is the net mass transport of the ocean surface resulting from wind stress and the Coriolis force. As wind blows across the ocean surface, it causes a frictional force that drags the uppermost surface water along with it. Due to the Earth&#x27;s rotation, these surface currents develop at 45° to the wind direction. However, compounding frictional forces cause the net transport across the Ekman layer to be 90° to the right of wind stress in the Northern Hemisphere and 90° to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Ekman transport piles up water between the trade winds and westerlies in subtropical gyres, or near the shore during coastal downwelling. The increased mass of surface water creates high-pressure zones that push water downward. It can also create long convergence zones during sustained winds to create Langmuir circulation.

== Buoyancy-forced downwelling ==
Buoyancy is lost through cooling, evaporation, and brine rejection through sea ice formation. Buoyancy loss occurs on many spatial and temporal scales. 

In the open ocean, there are regions where cooling and mixed layer deepening occurs at night, and the ocean re-stratifies during the day. On annual cycles, widespread cooling begins in the fall, and convective mixed layer deepening can reach hundreds of meters into the ocean interior. In comparison, the wind-driven mixed layer depth is limited to 150 m.

Large evaporation events can cause convection; however, latent heat loss associated with evaporation is usually dominant and in the winter, this process drives Mediterranean Sea deep water formation. In select locations - Greenland Sea, Labrador Sea, Weddell Sea, and Ross Sea - deep convection (&gt;1000 m) ventilates (oxygenates) most of the deep water of the global ocean and drives the thermohaline circulation.

== Wind-forced downwelling ==
=== Subtropical gyres ===
Subtropical gyres act on the largest scale that we observe downwelling. Winds to the north and south of each ocean basin blow opposite each other such that Ekman transport moves water toward the basin&#x27;s center. This movement piles up water, creating a high-pressure zone in the center of the gyre, low pressure on the borders, and deepens the mixed layer. The water in this zone would diffuse outward if the planet weren&#x27;t spinning. However, because of the Coriolis force, the water rotates clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern, creating a gyre. While it spins, the rotating high-pressure zone forces water downward, resulting in downwelling. Typical downwelling rates associated with ocean gyres are on the order of 10’s of meters per year. 

=== Coastal downwelling ===
Coastal downwelling occurs when winds blow parallel to the shore. With such winds, Ekman transport directs water movement towards or directly away from the shore. If Ekman transport moves water towards the shore, the shoreline acts as a barrier causing surface water to pile up onshore. The piled-up water is forced downwards, pumping warm, nutrient-poor, oxygenated water below the mixed layer.

=== Langmuir circulation ===
Langmuir circulation develops from the wind, which, through Ekman transport, creates alternating zones of convergence and divergence at the ocean surface. In convergent zones, marked by long strips of floating debris accumulation, such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, coherent vortices transport surface waters to the base of the mixed layer develop. Also, direct wind stirring and current shear at the base of the mixed layer can create instabilities and turbulence that further mix properties within and at the base.

== Association with other ocean features ==

=== Eddies ===

Meso- (&gt;10-100&#x27;s km) and submesoscale (&lt;1-10 km) eddies are ubiquitous features of the upper ocean. Eddies have either a cyclonic (cold-core) or anticyclonic (warm-core) rotation. Warm-core eddies are characterized by anticyclonic rotation that directs surface waters inward, creating high sea surface temperature and height. The high central hydrostatic pressure maintained by this rotation causes the downwelling of water and the depression of isopycnals - surfaces of constant density (see Eddy pumping) at scales of hundreds of meters per year. The typical result is a deeper surface layer of warm water often characterized by low primary production.

Warm-core eddies play multiple important roles in biogeochemical cycling and air-sea interactions. For example, these eddies are seen to decrease ice formation in the Southern Ocean due to their high sea surface temperatures. It has also been observed that air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide decrease at the center of these eddies and that temperature was the leading cause of this inhibited flux. Warm-core eddies transport oxygen into the ocean interior (below the photic zone) which supports respiration. Although compounds such as oxygen are transported into the deep ocean, there is an observed decrease in carbon export in warm-core eddies due to intensified stratification at their center. Such stratification inhibits the mixing of nutrient-rich waters to the surface where they could fuel primary production. In this case, since primary production stays low, carbon export potential remains low.

=== Fronts and filaments ===
Ocean fronts are formed by the horizontal convergence of dissimilar water masses. They can develop at regions of freshwater input marked by horizontal density gradients due to salinity and temperature differences or the stretching and elongation of rotating flows. 

Submesoscale fronts and filaments are formed by ocean current interactions and flow instabilities. They are regions that connect the surface layer and the ocean interior. These regions are characterized by horizontal buoyancy gradients &lt; 10 km in scale, caused by sloping isopycnals. Two primary mechanisms transport surface waters to depth: the adiabatic tilting and relaxation of these isopycnals, and along-isopycnal flow or subduction. These mechanisms can transport surface properties, such as heat, below the mixed layer and assist in carbon sequestration through the biological pump. Numerical models predict vertical velocities at submesoscale fronts on the order of 100 m/day. However, vertical velocities over 1000 m/day have been observed using ocean floats. These observations are rare because ship-based sensors do not have sufficient accuracy to measure vertical velocities.

== Variability ==
Downwelling trends differ between latitudes and can be associated with variations in wind strength and changing seasons. In some areas, coastal downwelling is a seasonal event pushing nutrient-depleted waters towards the shore. The relaxation or reversal of upwelling-favorable winds creates periods of downwelling as waters pile up along the coast.

Temperature differences and wind patterns are seasonal in temperate latitudes, creating highly variable upwelling and downwelling conditions. For example, in fall and winter along the Pacific Northwest coast in the United States, southerly winds in the Gulf of Alaska and California Current system create downwelling-favorable conditions, transporting offshore water from the south and west towards the coast. These downwelling events tend to last for days and can be associated with winter storms and contribute to low levels of primary production observed during fall and winter. In contrast, during the &quot;spring transition&quot; at the end of the downwelling season and the beginning of the upwelling season is marked by the presence of cold, nutrient-rich, upwelled water at the coast, which stimulates high levels of primary production. In contrast to seasonally variable temperate regions, downwelling is relatively steady at the poles as cold air decreases the temperature of salty water transported by gyres from the tropics.

During the neutral and La Niña phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), steady easterly trade winds in equatorial regions can cause water to pile up in the western Pacific. A weakening of these trade winds can create downwelling Kelvin waves, which propagate along the equator in the eastern Pacific. Series of Kelvin waves associated with anomalously warm sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific can be a predecessor to an El Niño event. During the El Niño phase of ENSO, the disruption of trade winds causes ocean water to pile up off the western coast of South America. This shift is associated with a decrease in upwelling and may enhance coastal downwelling.

== Effects on ocean biogeochemistry ==
Biogeochemical cycling related to downwelling is constrained by the location and frequency at which this process occurs. The majority of downwelling, as described above, occurs in polar regions as deep and bottom water formation or in the center of subtropical gyres. Bottom and deep water formation in the Southern Ocean (Weddell Sea) and North Atlantic Ocean (Greenland, Labrador, Norwegian, and Mediterranean Seas) is a major contributor towards the removal and sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved oxygen. Dissolved gas solubility is greater in cold water allowing for increased gas concentrations.

The Southern Ocean alone has been shown to be the most important high-latitude region controlling pre-industrial atmospheric carbon dioxide by general circulation model simulations. Circulation of water into the Antarctic deep-water formation region is one of the main factors drawing carbon dioxide into the surface oceans. The other is the biological pump, which is typically limited by iron in the Southern Ocean in areas with high nutrients and low chlorophyll (HNLC). DOC can become entrained during bottom and deep water formation which is a large portion of biogenic carbon export. It is thought that the export of DOC is up to 30% of the biogenic carbon that makes it into the deep ocean. The intensity of the DOC flux to depth relies on the strength of winter convection, which also affects the microbial food web, causing variations in the DOC exported to depth. Dissolved oxygen is also downwelled at bottom and deep water formation sites, contributing to elevated dissolved oxygen concentrations below 1000 meters.

Subtropical gyres are typically limited in macro and micro nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron; resulting in picophytoplankton communities that have low nutrient requirements. This is in part due to consistent downwelling, which transports nutrients away from the photic zone. These oligotrophic areas are thought to be sustained by rapid nutrient cycling which could leave little carbon remaining that could be sequestered. The dynamics of picophytoplankton&#x27;s role in carbon cycling in subtropical gyres is poorly understood and is being actively researched.

Areas with the highest primary productivity play significant roles in biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen. Downwelling can either alleviate or induce anoxic conditions, depending on the initial conditions and location. Sustained periods of upwelling can cause deoxygenation which is relieved by a downwelling event transporting dissolved oxygen back down to depths. Anoxic conditions can also result from persistent downwelling after an algal bloom of high-biomass dinoflagellates. The accumulation of dinoflagellates and other forms of biomass nearshore due to downwelling will eventually cause nutrient depletion and mortality of organisms. As the biomass decays, oxygen becomes depleted by heterotrophic bacteria, inducing anoxic conditions.
