<text>David Dean Rusk (February 9, 1909December 20, 1994) was the United States secretary of state from 1961 to 1969 under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, the second-longest serving secretary of state after Cordell Hull from the Franklin Roosevelt administration. He had been a high government official in the 1940s and early 1950s, as well as the head of a leading foundation. He is cited as one of the two officers responsible for dividing the two Koreas at the 38th parallel.

Born to a poor farm family in Cherokee County, Georgia, on February 9, 1909, Rusk graduated from Davidson College and was a Rhodes scholar at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he immersed himself in English history and customs. After teaching at Mills College in California, he became an army officer in the war against Japan. He served as a staff officer in the China Burma India Theater, becoming a senior aide to Joseph Stilwell, the top American general. As a civilian, he became a senior official in 1945 at the State Department, rising to the number-three position under Dean Acheson. He became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs in 1950. In 1952, Rusk left to become president of the Rockefeller Foundation.

After Kennedy won the 1960 presidential election, he asked Rusk to serve as secretary of state. Rusk was a quiet advisor to Kennedy, rarely making his own views known to other officials. He supported diplomatic efforts during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and though he initially expressed doubts about the escalation of the U.S. role in the Vietnam War, he became known as one of its strongest supporters. Asked to stay on by President Lyndon Johnson after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in 1963, Rusk was known to be a favorite of Johnson&#x27;s. He left the secretary role in January 1969, and taught international relations at the University of Georgia School of Law.

==Childhood and education==
David Dean Rusk was born in rural Cherokee County, Georgia. The Rusk ancestors had emigrated from Northern Ireland around 1795. His father Robert Hugh Rusk (1868–1944) had attended Davidson College and Louisville Theological Seminary. He left the ministry to become a cotton farmer and schoolteacher. Rusk&#x27;s mother Elizabeth Frances Clotfelter was of Swiss extraction. She had graduated from public school, and was a schoolteacher. When Rusk was four years old, the family moved to Atlanta, where his father worked for the U.S. Post Office. Rusk came to embrace the stern Calvinist work ethic and morality.
Like most white Southerners, his family was Democratic; young Rusk&#x27;s hero was President Woodrow Wilson, the first Southern president since the Civil War era. The experience of poverty made him sympathetic to Black Americans. As a 9-year-old, Rusk attended a rally in Atlanta where President Wilson called on the United States to join the League of Nations. Rusk grew up on the mythology and legends of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; so common to the South, and he came to embrace the militarism of Southern culture as he wrote in a high-school essay that &quot;young men should prepare themselves for service in case our country ever got into trouble.&quot; At the age of 12, Rusk had joined the ROTC, whose training duties he took very seriously. Rusk had an intense reverence for the military and throughout his later career, he was inclined to accept the advice of generals.

He was educated in Atlanta&#x27;s public schools, and graduated from Boys High School in 1925, spending two years working for an Atlanta lawyer before working his way through Davidson College, a Presbyterian school in North Carolina. He was active in the national military honor society Scabbard and Blade, becoming a cadet lieutenant colonel commanding the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps battalion. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931. While at Davidson, Rusk applied the Calvinist work ethic to his studies. He won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University. He studied international relations, taking an MA in PPE (Politics, Philosophy and Economics). He immersed himself in English history, politics, and popular culture, making lifelong friends among the British elite. Rusk&#x27;s rise from poverty made him a passionate believer in the &quot;American Dream&quot;, and a recurring theme throughout his life was his oft-expressed patriotism, a place in which he believed that anyone, no matter how modest their circumstances, could rise up to live the &quot;American Dream&quot;.

Rusk married Virginia Foisie (October 5, 1915 – February 24, 1996) on June 9, 1937. They had three children: David, Richard, and Peggy Rusk.

Rusk taught at Mills College in Oakland, California, from 1934 to 1949 (except during his military service), and he earned an LL.B. degree at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law in 1940.

==Career prior to 1961==
While studying in England as a Rhodes scholar at St. John&#x27;s College, Oxford, he received the Cecil Peace Prize in 1933. Rusk&#x27;s experiences of the events of the early 1930s decisively shaped his later views, as he told Karnow in an interview: I was a senior in college the year that the Japanese seized Manchuria and I have the picture still etched in my mind from the newsreel of the Chinese ambassador standing before the League of Nations, pleading for help against the Japanese attack. I myself was present in the Oxford Union on that night in 1933, when they passed the motion that &quot;this house will not fight for king and country&quot; ...So one cannot have lived through those years and not have some pretty strong feelings ... that it was the failure of the governments of the world to prevent aggression that made the catastrophe of World War II inevitable.

===Military in Southeast Asia===
During the 1930s, Rusk served in the Army reserves. He was called to active duty in December 1940 as a captain. He served as a staff officer in the China Burma India Theater. During the war, Rusk had authorized an air drop of arms to the Viet Minh guerrillas in Vietnam commanded by his future enemy Ho Chi Minh. At war&#x27;s end, he was a colonel, decorated with the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster.

===State Department 1945–1953===

Rusk returned to America to work briefly for the War Department in Washington, DC. He joined the Department of State in February 1945, and worked for the office of United Nations Affairs. In the same year, he suggested splitting Korea into spheres of U.S. and of Soviet influence at the 38th parallel north. After Alger Hiss left State in January 1947, Rusk succeeded him (as director of the Office of Special Political Affairs), according to Max Lowenthal.

Rusk was a supporter of the Marshall Plan and of the United Nations. In 1948, he supported the Secretary of State George Marshall in advising Truman against recognizing Israel, fearing it would damage relations with oil-rich Arab states like Saudi Arabia, but was overruled by Truman&#x27;s legal counsel, Clark Clifford, who persuaded the president to recognize Israel. When Marshall was asked to explain why he did not resign over the recognition of Israel, he replied that the secretary of state did not resign over decisions made by the president who had the ultimate control of foreign policy. Rusk, who admired Marshall, supported his decision and always quoted the remark made by Truman: &quot;The president makes the foreign policy&quot;. In 1949, he was made deputy Undersecretary of State under Dean Acheson, who had replaced Marshall as secretary of state.

===Assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern affairs===
In 1950, Rusk was made assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern affairs, at his own request, arguing that he knew Asia the best. He played an influential part in the US decision to become involved in the Korean War, and in Japan&#x27;s postwar compensation for victorious countries, as shown in the Rusk documents. Rusk was a cautious diplomat and always sought international support. Rusk favored support for Asian nationalist movements, arguing that European imperialism was doomed in Asia, but the Atlanticist Acheson favored closer relations with the European powers, which precluded American support for Asian nationalism. Rusk dutifully declared it was his duty to support Acheson.

====French Indochina====
When question arose as to whether the United States should support France in maintaining control over Indochina against the Communist Viet Minh guerrillas, Rusk argued for support of the French government, stating that the Viet Minh were just the instruments of Soviet expansionism in Asia and to refuse to support the French would amount to appeasement. Under strong American pressure, the French granted nominal independence to the State of Vietnam in February 1950 under the Emperor Bao Dai, which the United States recognized within days. However, it was widely known that the State of Vietnam was still in effect a French colony as French officials controlled all of the important ministries and the Emperor bitterly remarked to the press: &quot;What they call a Bao Dai solution turns out to be just a French solution.&quot; In June 1950, Rusk testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: &quot;This is a civil war that has been in effect captured by the [Soviet] Politburo and, besides, has been turned into a tool of the Politburo. So it isn&#x27;t a civil war in the usual sense. It is part of the international war ... We have to look at in terms of which side we are on in this particular kind of struggle ... Because Ho Chi Minh is tied with the Politburo, our policy is to support Bao Dai and the French in Indochina until we have time to help them establish a going concern.&quot;

====Korean War====
In April 1951, Truman sacked General Douglas MacArthur as the commander of the American forces in Korea over the question about whether to carry the war into China. At the time, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, called war with China &quot;the wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and with the wrong enemy&quot;. In May 1951, Rusk gave a speech at a dinner sponsored by the China Institute in Washington, which he had not submitted to the State Department in advance, where he implied the United States should unify Korea under Syngman Rhee and should overthrow Mao Zedong in China. Rusk&#x27;s speech attracted more attention than he expected, as the columnist Walter Lippmann ran a column reading &quot;Bradley vs. Rusk&quot;, accusing Rusk of advocating a policy of unconditional surrender in the Korean war. For embarrassing Acheson, Rusk was forced to resign and went into the private sector as the director of the Rockefeller Foundation.

===Rockefeller Foundation===
Rusk and his family moved to Scarsdale, New York, while he served as a Rockefeller Foundation trustee from 1950 to 1961. In 1952 he succeeded Chester L. Barnard as president of the foundation.

==Secretary of State==
===Selection===
On December 12, 1960, Democratic President-elect John F. Kennedy nominated Rusk to be Secretary of State. Rusk was not Kennedy&#x27;s first choice; his first choice, J. William Fulbright, proved too controversial. David Halberstam also described Rusk as &quot;everybody&#x27;s number two&quot;. Rusk had recently written an article titled &quot;The President&quot; in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; calling for the president to direct foreign policy with the secretary of state as a mere adviser, which had Kennedy&#x27;s interest after it was pointed out to him. After deciding that Fulbright&#x27;s support for segregation disqualified him, Kennedy summoned Rusk for a meeting, where he himself endorsed Fulbright as the man best qualified to be Secretary of State. Rusk himself was not particularly interested in running the State Department as the annual pay for secretary of state was $25,000 while his job as director of the Rockefeller Foundation paid $60,000 per year. Rusk only agreed to take the position out of a sense of patriotism after Kennedy insisted that he take the job.

Kennedy biographer Robert Dallek explained Rusk&#x27;s choice thus:

Kennedy tended to address Rusk as &quot;Mr. Rusk&quot; instead of Dean.

Rusk took charge of a department he knew well when it was half the size. It now employed 23,000 people including 6,000 Foreign Service officers and had diplomatic relations with 98 countries. He had faith in the use of military action to combat communism. Despite private misgivings about the Bay of Pigs invasion, he remained noncommittal during the executive council meetings leading up to the attack and never opposed it outright. Early in his tenure, he had strong doubts about US intervention in Vietnam, but later his vigorous public defense of US actions in the Vietnam War made him a frequent target of anti-war protests. Just as had under the Truman administration, Rusk tended to favor hawkish line towards Vietnam and frequently allied himself in debates in the Cabinet and on the National Security Council with equally hawkish Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.

===Vietnam and Laos===
Against the criticism made by Edward Lansdale of the embassy in Saigon, Rusk defended the performance of the State Department, saying South Vietnam was a difficult assignment. On 9 March 1961, the communist Pathet Lao won a notable victory on the Plains of Jars, and for a moment the Pathet Lao seemed on the verge of seizing all of Laos. Rusk expressed considerable disgust when he learned that neither side in the Lao civil war fought very hard, citing a report that both sides had broken off combat to go celebrate a water festival for ten days before resuming their battle. Rusk, who had much experience of Southeast Asia during World War Two, expressed much doubt if bombing alone would stop the Pathet Lao, saying it was his experience that bombing only worked with ground troops to hold the ground or advance.

===Military plans===
The Undersecretary of State, Chester Bowles, wrote to Rusk in late March 1961, saying he heard rumors that Cuban emigres were being trained by the CIA for an invasion of Cuba, which he asked Rusk to stop, saying it was against the rules of the Organization of American States. Rusk did not pass on the memo to Kennedy nor did he himself speak out against the Bay of Pigs invasion, even when his own military experience had convinced him that a single brigade &quot;did not stand a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell&quot; of toppling&#x27;s Cuba&#x27;s government.

In April 1961, when a proposal to send 100 more American military advisers to South Vietnam to make a total of 800 appeared before Kennedy, Rusk argued for acceptance even as he noted that it violated the Geneva Accords of 1954 (which the United States had not signed, but promised to abide by), which limited the number of foreign military personnel in Vietnam to 700 at a time. Rusk stated that International Control Commission consisting of diplomats from India, Poland and Canada which was supposed to enforce the Geneva Accords should not be informed of the deployment and the advisers &quot;be placed in varied locations to avoid attention&quot;. Rusk favored a hawkish line on Laos. Kennedy decided otherwise, on the grounds that Laos had no modern airfields and there was a risk of Chinese intervention. Rusk opened the Geneva conference on neutralizing Laos and predicted to Kennedy that the negotiations would fail.

Rusk continued his Rockefeller Foundation interest in aiding developing nations and also supported low tariffs to encourage world trade.

===USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident===
Rusk drew the ire of supporters of Israel after he let it be known that he believed the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident was a deliberate attack on the ship, rather than an accident. He was very outspoken about his views on the attack: “Accordingly, there is every reason to believe that the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; was or should have been identified, or at least her nationality determined, prior to the attack. In these circumstances, the later military attack by Israeli aircraft on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; is quite literally incomprehensible. As a minimum, the attack must be condemned as an act of military irresponsibility reflecting reckless disregard for human life. The subsequent attack by Israeli torpedo boats, substantially after the vessel was or should have been identified by Israeli military forces, manifests the same reckless disregard for human life. At the time of the attack, the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; was flying the American flag and its identification was clearly indicated in large white letters and numerals on its hull. It was broad daylight and the weather conditions were excellent. Experience demonstrates that both the flag and the identification number of the vessel were readily visible from the air. At a minimum, the attack must be condemned as an act of military recklessness reflecting wanton disregard for human life. The silhouette and conduct of the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; readily distinguished it from any vessel that could have been considered as hostile. The USS &quot;Liberty&quot; was peacefully engaged, posed no threat whatsoever to the torpedo boats, and obviously carried no armament affording it a combat capability. It could and should have been scrutinized visually at close range before torpedoes were fired.” In 1990 he wrote, “I was never satisfied with the Israeli explanation. Their sustained attack to disable and sink &quot;Liberty&quot; precluded an assault by accident or by some trigger-happy local commander. Through diplomatic channels we refused to accept their explanations. I didn&#x27;t believe them then, and I don&#x27;t believe them to this day. The attack was outrageous.”

After an Israeli claim appeared in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that they had inquired about the presence of U.S. ships in the area before the attack, Rusk telegrammed the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv and demanded “urgent confirmation.” U.S. Ambassador to Israel Walworth Barbour confirmed that Israel&#x27;s story was bogus: “No request for info on U.S. ships operating off Sinai was made until after &quot;Liberty&quot; incident. Had Israelis made such an inquiry it would have been forwarded immediately to the chief of naval operations and other high naval commands and repeated to dept.”

===Asian affairs===
On March 24, 1961, Rusk released a brief statement saying his delegation was to travel to Bangkok and the SEATO nations&#x27; responsibility should be considered if peace settlements were not realized. In 1961, Rusk disapproved of the Indian invasion of Goa, which he regarded as an act of aggression against NATO ally Portugal, but was overruled by Kennedy who wanted to improve relations with India and who also noted the Portuguese had no other option but to be allied to the United States. Earlier in 1961, a major rebellion had broken out in the Portuguese colony of Angola, which increased Portugal&#x27;s reliance upon its largest supplier of arms, the United States. In regards to the West New Guinea dispute about the Netherlands New Guinea, Rusk favored supporting the NATO ally Netherlands against Indonesia as he saw Sukarno as pro-Chinese. Rusk accused Indonesia of aggression by attacking the Dutch forces in New Guinea in 1962 and believed that Sukarno had violated the United Nations charter, but was again overruled by Kennedy. In a case of &quot;realpolitik&quot;, Kennedy argued the Dutch had no choice, but to be allied with the United States, meaning they could be taken for granted whereas he was highly concerned that Indonesia, which he called &quot;the most significant nation in Southeast Asia&quot;, might become communist. To improve relations with Sukarno, Kennedy decided to support the Indonesian claim to Dutch New Guinea; Rusk later wrote he felt &quot;queasy&quot; about the way that Kennedy sacrificed the Dutch to win over Indonesia and had strong doubts that the &quot;consultation&quot; scheduled to determine the future of the territory in 1969 would be a free and fair one.

===Middle East===
President Nasser of Egypt was regarded as a trouble-maker in Washington owing to Egypt&#x27;s alliance with the Soviet Union and his plans for a pan-Arab state that would of necessity require overthrowing the governments of every Arab state, most notably American allies such as Saudi Arabia. In the Arab Cold War between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Rusk favored the latter. However, at the same time, Rusk argued to Kennedy to Nasser was a spoiler who wanted to play off the Soviet Union against the United States to get the best possible bargain for Egypt, and if he leaned in a pro-Soviet direction, it was because the United States refused to sell Egypt arms out of the fear that they might be used against Israel whereas the Soviets by contrast were willing to sell Egyptians any arms they wanted short of nuclear weapons. Rusk noted the United States still had significant leverage over Egypt in the form of the PL 480 law that allowed the United States to sell surplus American agricultural production to any &quot;friendly nation&quot; in the local currency instead of U.S. dollars. In Egypt, the government subsidized the sale of staple foods like bread at cost or below cost prices, and Egypt&#x27;s growing population, which outstripped the capacity of Egypt&#x27;s agriculture, required Egypt to import food. Nasser had become very dependent upon the PL 480 food sales to provide food at cost to his people, and moreover the Soviet Union could not hope to match America&#x27;s food sales to Egypt. Nasser argued in exchange for PL 480 food sales that he would not start a war with Israel, saying for that for all his fiery speeches he promised to keep the Arab-Israeli dispute &quot;in the icebox&quot;. Rusk argued that to Kennedy and later Johnson that they should resist congressional pressure to end the PL 480 food sales to Egypt, stating that ending the PL 480 sales would only push Nasser closer to the Soviet Union and end the leverage that kept the peace between Egypt and Israel. When Nasser sent 70,000 Egyptian troops into Yemen in September 1962 to support the republican government against the royalist guerrillas supported by Saudi Arabia, Rusk approved of increased arm sales to Saudi Arabia, which were an indirect way of supporting the Yemeni royalists. In common with decision-makers in Washington, Rusk felt that the United States had to support Saudi Arabia against Egypt, but he advised Kennedy against pushing Nasser too hard, saying that it would only drive him closer to the Soviet Union. On October 8, 1962, a &quot;Food for Peace&quot; deal was signed with Egypt under the United States committed itself to sell at cost $390 million worth of wheat to Egypt for the next three years. By 1962, Egypt imported 50% of its wheat consumed from the United States and owing to the PL 480 law was some $180 million per year at a time when Egypt&#x27;s foreign reserves were almost deleted owing to a heavy level of military spending.
In May 1963, out of anger at being trapped in the quagmire of fighting a guerrilla war in Yemen, Nasser ordered Egyptian Air Force squadrons in Yemen to start bombing towns in Saudi Arabia. With Egypt and Saudi Arabia on the brink of war, Kennedy decided with the support of Rusk to throw America&#x27;s weight on the side of Saudi Arabia. Kennedy quietly dispatched several U.S. Air Force squadrons to Saudi Arabia and warned Nasser that if he attacked Saudi Arabia, the United States would go to war with Egypt. The American warning had its effect and Nasser decided that discretion was the better part of valor. Despite all the tension in American-Egyptian relations, Rusk still argued that it was better to keep the PL 480 food sales to Egypt going than to end them, maintaining keeping the Arab-Israeli dispute &quot;in the icebox&quot; as Nasser phrased it depended upon the United States having leverage over Egypt.

===Cuba===
During the Cuban Missile Crisis he supported diplomatic efforts. A careful review by Sheldon Stern, Head of the JFK Library, of Kennedy&#x27;s audio recordings of the EXCOMM meetings suggests that Rusk&#x27;s contributions to the discussions probably averted a nuclear war.

===Overthrow of Vietnam President Diem ===
In August 1963, a series of misunderstandings rocked the Kennedy administration when, in reaction to the Buddhist crisis, a policy proposal urging the overthrow of President Diem of South Vietnam was presented to Kennedy. He stated he would consider adopting it if Rusk gave his approval first. Rusk, who had gone to New York to attend a session of the United Nations, cautiously gave approval out of the impression that Kennedy had approved it first. When it emerged that was not the case, Kennedy assembled his foreign policy team for a stormy meeting at the White House, with several, such as McNamara, Vice President Lyndon Johnson, and CIA director John McCone, all speaking for standing with Diem, while others like the Undersecretary of State George Ball, W. Avrell Harriman and Roger Hilsman argued for deposing Diem. Much to Kennedy&#x27;s annoyance, Rusk maintained a stony silence, refusing to take a side. At the end of the meeting, Kennedy exclaimed: &quot;My God, my government is falling apart!&quot; On August 31, 1963, the diplomat Paul Kattenburg reported from Saigon that public opinion in South Vietnam was overwhelmingly hostile to Diem, which led him to suggest it was time &quot;for us to get out honorably&quot;. All of the assembled officials rejected Kattenburg&#x27;s idea, with Rusk saying &quot;we will not pull out ... until the war is won.&quot; Rusk reassigned Kattenburg from South Vietnam to Guyana. 
===Poor relationship with President Kennedy===
As he recalled in his autobiography, &quot;As I Saw It&quot;, Rusk did not have a good relationship with President Kennedy. The president was often irritated by Rusk&#x27;s reticence in advisory sessions and felt that the State Department was &quot;like a bowl of jelly&quot; and that it &quot;never comes up with any new ideas&quot;. In 1963, &quot;Newsweek&quot; ran a cover story on the National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy under the title &quot;Cool Head for the Cold War&quot;. The author of the story wrote that Rusk &quot;was not known for his force and decisiveness&quot; and asserted that Bundy was &quot;the real Secretary of State&quot;. Special counsel to the president Ted Sorensen believed that Kennedy, being well versed and practiced in foreign affairs, acted as his own secretary of state. Sorensen also said that the president often expressed impatience with Rusk and felt him under-prepared for emergency meetings and crises. As Rusk recounted in his autobiography, he repeatedly offered his resignation, but it was never accepted. Rumors of Rusk&#x27;s dismissal leading up to the 1964 election abounded prior to President Kennedy&#x27;s trip to Dallas in 1963. Shortly after Kennedy was assassinated, Rusk offered his resignation to the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson. However, Johnson liked Rusk and refused his resignation. He remained secretary throughout Johnson&#x27;s administration.

===Defending South Vietnam===
In June 1964, Rusk met with Hervé Alphand, the French ambassador in Washington, to discuss a French plan for neutralization of both Vietnams, a plan which Rusk was skeptical about. Rusk told Alphand: &quot;To us, the defense of South Vietnam has the same significance as the defense of Berlin.&quot; In response, Alphand stated: &quot;The loss of Berlin would shake the foundations of Western security. On the other hand, if we were to lose South Vietnam, we would not be losing much.&quot; By contrast, Rusk argued that the Berlin issue and the Vietnam war were all part of the same struggle against the Soviet Union and the United States could not falter anywhere.

===Distrusting Robert Kennedy===
Rusk quickly became one of Johnson&#x27;s favorite advisers, and just before the Democratic National Convention the two had a discussion about Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who was angling to be Johnson&#x27;s running mate, much to the president&#x27;s discomfort. Both Johnson and Rusk agreed that Kennedy was &quot;freakishly ambitious&quot; with an obsessive desire to one day be president. Rusk told Johnson: &quot;Mr. President, I just can&#x27;t wrap my mind around that kind of ambition. I don&#x27;t know how to understand it.&quot;

===Vietnam in 1964 ===
Just after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, Rusk supported the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. 
On August 29, 1964, amid the ongoing presidential election, Rusk called for bipartisan support to ensure that the US&#x27;s foreign policy have both consistency and reliability and said Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater was creating &quot;mischief&quot;. The following month, at a September 10 press conference in the main auditorium of the State Department, Rusk said that Senator Goldwater&#x27;s critiques &quot;reflect a basic lack of understanding&quot; of a U.S. President&#x27;s handling of conflict and peace.

On September 7, 1964, Johnson assembled his national security team to seek a consensus about what to do about Vietnam. Rusk advised caution, arguing that Johnson should embark on military measures only after diplomacy had been exhausted. In September 1964, Rusk grew frustrated with the endless infighting amongst South Vietnam&#x27;s junta of generals and after a failed coup d&#x27;état against Nguyễn Khánh sent a message to Maxwell Taylor, the ambassador in Saigon, on September 14, stating he was to &quot;make it emphatically clear&quot; to Khánh and the rest of the junta that Johnson was tired of the infighting. Rusk also instructed Taylor to say: &quot;The United States has not provided massive assistance to South Vietnam, in military equipment, economic resources, and personnel in order to subsidize continuing quarrels among South Vietnamese leaders.&quot; Reflecting the general vexation with South Vietnam&#x27;s chronic political instability in Washington, Rusk argued to Johnson: &quot;Somehow we must change the pace at which these people move, and I suspect that this can only be done with a pervasive intrusion of Americans into their affairs.&quot; Increasingly, the feeling in Washington was if South Vietnam could not defeat the Viet Cong guerrillas on its own, the Americans would have to step in and win the war that the South Vietnamese had proved incapable of winning. On September 21, Rusk said the US would not be pushed out of the Gulf of Tonkin and that the prevention of it becoming a &quot;communist lake&quot; would be assured by the continued presence of American forces there.

In September 1964, a peace initiative was launched by the UN Secretary General U Thant who tried to set up secret peace talks in his native Burma, which were supported by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev who pressured Ho Chi Minh to take part in the projected peace talks, saying he would only increase Soviet aid to North Vietnam if the North Vietnamese took part in a diplomatic effort to end the war first. U Thant reported to Rusk that the Soviet pressure seemed to be working as North Vietnam&#x27;s other arms supplier, China, could not match the hi-tech weaponry that only the Soviet Union could supply. Rusk did not press on this information on Johnson, saying to take part in the planned talks in Burma would have signaled &quot;the acceptance or the confirmation of aggression&quot;. In October, the peace initiative was ended by Khrushchev being ousted and his successor, Leonid Brezhnev, was not interested in U Thant&#x27;s plan.

On 1 November 1964, the Viet Cong attacked the American airbase at Bien Hoa, killing 4 Americans. Rusk told Ambassador Taylor that with the elections occurring in less than 48 hours, Johnson did not want to act, but after the election there would be &quot;a more systematic campaign of military pressure on the North with all implications we have always seen in their course of action&quot;.

===Nasser===
On December 23, 1964, Nasser decided to up the ante in his relations with the United States by delivering a violently anti-American speech in Port Said in which he called Iran &quot;an American and Zionist colony&quot; and claimed Johnson wanted to reduce Egypt to the status of Iran. Through Nasser was hoping that his speech might force the United States to reduce military aid to Saudi Arabia, it had the opposite effect. Johnson, who was more pro-Israeli than Kennedy had been, was furious with the speech. Rusk later recalled: &quot;We didn&#x27;t expect Nasser to bow, scrape, lick our boots, and say &#x27;Thank you Uncle Sam&#x27;, but we did expect to at least moderate his virulent criticism of the United States. Instead, he got up in front of those big crowds in Cairo and shouted such things as &#x27;Throw your aid into the Red Sea!&#x27;&quot; On January 5, 1965, Johnson suspended all PL 480 aid to Egypt, an action that immediately plunged the Egyptian economy into a crisis. Nasser realized what he had done and began to lobby for the resumption of PL 480 food sales, but got nowhere. Though Nasser knew the best way of ending the crisis was to pull out of Yemen and seek a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and the United States, he instead turned towards the Soviet Union to seek support for the rapidly contracting Egyptian economy.

===Robert Kennedy undercuts Rusk===
In April 1965, Senator Robert Kennedy during a visit to the White House advised Johnson to sack Rusk and replace him with Bill Moyers. Johnson at first thought this was a joke, saying that Kennedy&#x27;s brother had appointed him Secretary of State, and was astonished to learn that Kennedy was serious. The president replied: &quot;I like Bill Moyers, but I&#x27;m not about to remove Rusk.&quot;

===Vietnam in 1965===
In May 1965, Rusk told Johnson that the &quot;Four Points&quot; presented by the North Vietnam premier Dong as peace terms were deceptive because &quot;the third of those four points required the imposition of the National Liberation Front on all South Vietnam&quot;. In June 1965, when General William Westmoreland requested of Johnson 180, 000 troops to Vietnam, Rusk argued to Johnson that the United States had to fight in Vietnam to maintain &quot;the integrity of the U.S. commitment&quot; throughout the world, but also wondered aloud if Westermoreland was exaggerating the extent of the problems in South Vietnam in order to have more troops under his command. However, despite his doubts about Westmoreland Rusk in a rare memo to the president warned that if South Vietnam were lost &quot;the Communist world would draw conclusions that would lead to our ruin and almost certainly to a catastrophic war&quot;. At another meeting, Rusk stated the United States should have committed itself to Vietnam more heavily in 1961, saying that if U.S. troops had been sent to fight then, the present difficulties would not exist.

Rusk came into conflict with his Undersecretary of State, George Ball, about Vietnam. When Ball argued the governing duumvirate of Thieu and Ky in South Vietnam were &quot;clowns&quot; unworthy of American support, Rusk replied: &quot;Don&#x27;t give me that stuff. You don&#x27;t understand that at the time of Korea we had to go out and dig up Syngman Rhee out of the bush where he was hiding. There was no government in Korea, either. We&#x27;re going to get some breaks, and this thing is going to work.&quot; Rusk felt that Ball&#x27;s memos arguing that American involvement in the war should be seen by as few as possible. At meetings of the National Security Council, Rusk consistently argued against Ball.

===Britain will not send troops===
In 1964 and again in 1965, Rusk approached the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson to ask for British troops to go to Vietnam, requests that were refused. The normally Anglophile Rusk saw the refusal as a &quot;betrayal&quot;. Rusk told the &quot;Times&quot; of London: &quot;All we needed was just one regiment. The Black Watch would have done it. Just one regiment, but you wouldn&#x27;t. Well, don&#x27;t expect us to save you again. They can invade Sussex and we won&#x27;t do a damn thing about it.&quot;

Shortly before his death, Adlai Stevenson, the American ambassador to the UN, mentioned in an interview with the journalist Eric Severeid the aborted peace terms in Rangoon in 1964, saying the UN Secretary General U Thant was disappointed that Rusk had rejected the terms. When Johnson asked Rusk about the matter, the latter replied that in diplomacy &quot;there is a difference between rejecting a proposal and not accepting it&quot;, a distinction that Rusk claimed that U Thant had missed.

===Bombing pause discussed===
In December 1965, when McNamara first told Johnson that the &quot;military action approach is an unacceptable way to a successful conclusion&quot; and urged him to pause the bombing of North Vietnam, Rusk advised the president that there was only a 1 in 20 chance that a bombing pause would lead to peace talks. However, Rusk argued for the bombing pause, saying &quot;You must think about the morale of the American people if the other side keeps pushing. We must be able to say that all has been done.&quot; When Johnson announced the bombing pause on Christmas Day 1965, Rusk told the press &quot;We have put everything into the basket of peace except the surrender of South Vietnam.&quot; Some of the language that Rusk included in his offer for peace talks seemed to calculate to inspire rejection such as the demand that Hanoi must publicly vow &quot;to cease aggression&quot; and the bombing pause was &quot;a step toward peace, although there has not been the slightest hint or suggestion from the other side as to what they would do if the bombing stopped.&quot; On December 28, 1965, Rusk sent a cable to Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the ambassador in Saigon, presenting the bombing pause as merely a cynical exercise in public relations as he wrote: &quot;The prospect of large-scale reinforcements in men and defense budget increases for the next eighteen-month period requires solid preparation of the American public. A crucial element will be a clear demonstration that we have explored fully every alternative but the aggressors has left us no choice.&quot; Rusk ordered Henry A. Byroade, the ambassador in Rangoon, to make contact with the North Vietnamese ambassador to Burma with the offer that the bombing pause might be extended if North Vietnam made &quot;a serious contribution to peace&quot;. The offer was rejected as the North Vietnamese refused to open peace talks until the bombing raids were stopped &quot;unconditionally and for good&quot;. Like the other newly independent states in Africa and Asia, the North Vietnamese were extremely sensitive to any violation, real or perceived, of their newly achieved sovereignty, and the North Vietnamese Politburo regarded the bombing as a major violation of their nation&#x27;s sovereignty. In a way that the Johnson administration had much trouble understanding, the North Vietnamese felt to negotiate with the Americans reserving the right to resume the bombing would be to accept a diminution of their country&#x27;s independence, hence the demand for an unconditional bombing halt. In January 1966, Johnson ordered the Rolling Thunder bombing raids to resume.

===France versus NATO===
After President of France Charles de Gaulle withdrew France from the common NATO military command in February 1966 and ordered all American military forces to leave France, President Johnson asked Rusk to seek further clarification from President de Gaulle by asking whether the bodies of buried American soldiers must leave France as well. Rusk recorded in his autobiography that de Gaulle did not respond when asked, &quot;Does your order include the bodies of American soldiers in France&#x27;s cemeteries?&quot;

===Fulbright hearings on Vietnam===
In February 1966, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chaired by Fulbright held hearings on the Vietnam War and Fulbright had called as expert witnesses George F. Kennan and General James Gavin, who were both critical of the Vietnam War. Rusk who served as Johnson&#x27;s principal spokesman on Vietnam was sent by the president together with General Maxwell Taylor to serve as his rebuttal witnesses before the Foreign Relations Committee. Rusk testified that the war was a morally justified struggle to halt &quot;the steady extension of Communist power through force and threat&quot;. Historian Stanley Karnow wrote the televised hearings were a compelling &quot;political theater&quot; as Fulbright and Rusk verbally dueled about the merits of the Vietnam war with both men pouncing on any weaknesses in the other&#x27;s argument.

===1966 hawks versus doves===
By 1966, the Johnson administration had become divided between the &quot;hawks&quot; and the &quot;doves&quot;, through the latter term was somewhat misleading as the &quot;doves&quot; within the administration merely favored opening peace talks to end the war as opposed to pulling out U.S. forces from Vietnam. Rusk together with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Earle &quot;Bus&quot; Wheeler and the National Security Adviser Walt Whitman Rostow were the leading &quot;hawks&quot; while the leading &quot;doves&quot; was Rusk&#x27;s former ally McNamara together with Harriman. Rusk equated withdrawal from Vietnam as &quot;appeasement&quot;, through at times he was willing to advise Johnson to open peace talks as a way to rebut domestic criticism that Johnson was unwilling to consider alternative ways to end the war.

===1967 deescalation===
On April 18, 1967, Rusk said the United States was prepared to &quot;take steps to deescalate the conflict whenever we are assured that the north will take appropriate corresponding steps&quot;.

In 1967, Rusk was opposed to the Operation Pennsylvania peace plan touted by Henry Kissinger, saying &quot;Eight months pregnant with peace and all of them hoping to win the Nobel Peace Prize&quot;. When Kissinger reported that the North Vietnamese would not begin peace talks unless the bombing was stopped first, Rusk advocated continuing the bombing, telling Johnson: &quot;If the bombing isn&#x27;t having that much effect, why do they want to stop the bombing so much?&quot;

===Rusk family issues===
Rusk&#x27;s support for the Vietnam War caused considerable torment for his son Richard, who was opposed to the war but who enlisted in the Marine Corps and refused to attend anti-war demonstrations out of love for his father. The psychological strain caused the younger Rusk to suffer a nervous breakdown and led to a break between father and son.

Rusk considered resignation in the summer of 1967, because &quot;his daughter planned to marry a black classmate at Stanford University, and he could not impose such a political burden on the president&quot;, after it became known that his daughter, Peggy, planned to marry Guy Smith, &quot;a black Georgetown grad working at NASA&quot;. In response, the &quot;Richmond News Leader&quot; stated that it found the wedding offensive, further saying that &quot;anything which diminishes [Rusk&#x27;s] personal acceptability is an affair of state.&quot; He decided not to resign after talking to McNamara and the president. A year after his daughter&#x27;s wedding, Rusk was invited to join the faculty of the University of Georgia Law School, only to have his appointment denounced by Roy Harris, an ally of Alabama Governor George Wallace and a member of the university&#x27;s board of regents, who stated that his opposition was because of Peggy Rusk&#x27;s interracial marriage. The university nonetheless appointed Rusk to the position.

===Rusk sees communists in peace movement===
In October 1967, Rusk told Johnson that he believed the March on the Pentagon was the work of &quot;the Communists&quot;, and pressed Johnson to order an investigation to prove it. The investigation was launched involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and military intelligence, and found &quot;no significant evidence that would prove Communist control or direction of the U.S. peace movement and its leaders.&quot; Rusk said that the report was &quot;naive&quot; and that the agents should have done a better investigation.

===Vietnam and 1968 election ===
When Johnson first discussed dropping out of the 1968 election at a National Security Council meeting in September 1967, Rusk was opposed, saying: &quot;You must not go down. You are the Commander-in-chief, and we are in war. This would have a very serious effect on the country.&quot; When McNamara advised Johnson in October 1967 to agree to North Vietnam&#x27;s demand that the United States cease the bombing campaign as the precondition for opening peace talks, Rusk opposed the idea of a &quot;bombing pause&quot; as removing the &quot;incentive for peace&quot;, and urged Johnson to continue Operation Rolling Thunder. By this time, many at the State Department were concerned by Rusk&#x27;s drinking on the job with William Bundy later saying that Rusk was a like a &quot;zombie&quot; until he started to drink. McNamara was shocked when he visited him at Foggy Bottom in the afternoon and saw Rusk open his desk to pull out a bottle of scotch, which he proceeded to drink in its entirety. Unlike the abrasive McNamara, who was widely disliked at the Pentagon, Rusk was sufficiently liked by his colleagues in the State Department that none leaked their concerns about his drinking to the media.

On January 5, 1968, notes by Rusk were delivered to Ambassador of the Soviet Union to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin, pleading support from the US to &quot;avoid recurrence of&quot; claimed bombing of Russian cargo ships in the Haiphong North Vietnam port the day prior. On February 9, Rusk was asked by Senator William Fulbright over his possible information in regards to a US tactical nuclear weapons introduction in South Vietnam report.

Like other members of the Johnson administration, Rusk was shaken by the surprise of the Tet Offensive. During a news briefing at the height of the Tet Offensive, Rusk who was known for his courteous manner, was asked how the Johnson administration was taken by surprise, causing him to snap in fury: &quot;Whose side are you on? Now, I&#x27;m the Secretary of State of the United States, and I&#x27;m on our side! None of your papers or your broadcasting apparatuses are worth a damn unless the United States succeeds. They are trivial compared to that question. So I don&#x27;t know why people have to be probing for things that one can bitch about, when there are two thousand stories on the same day about things that are more constructive.&quot; However, despite his rage at the media who he felt were misrepresenting the war, he admitted to finding signs that public opinion was shifting against the war. He later recalled that during a visit to Cherokee County in February 1968 that people were telling him: &quot;Dean if you can&#x27;t tell us when this war is going to end, well then maybe we just ought to chuck it.&quot; Rusk added &quot;The fact was that we could not, in any good faith, tell them.&quot; Shortly afterwards, in March 1968 Rusk appeared as a witness before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chaired by Fulbright that was examining allegations that the Johnson administration had been dishonest about the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964. Fulbright made his sympathies clear by wearing a necktie decorated with doves and olive branches. Through Rusk handled himself well under the relentless questioning by Fulbright, the televised hearings were another blow to the prestige of the Johnson administration as it became very apparent to the viewers that a number of senators were now opposed to the war or were only lukewarm in their support. When Fulbright asked Rusk to promise Congress a greater say in the war, Rusk replied that Johnson would consult &quot;appropriate members of Congress&quot;. When Senator Claiborne Pell asked if the war was worth all the suffering, Rusk charged that he was suffering from &quot;moral myopia&quot; about &quot;the endless struggle for freedom&quot;.

On April 17, during an American Society of Newspaper Editors luncheon meeting, Rusk admitted that the United States has taken &quot;some lumps&quot; propaganda wise but the Johnson administration should persist in trying to find a location of neutrality for the peace talks to occur. The following day, Rusk added 10 sites to the 5 proposed initially, accusing Hanoi of having a propaganda battle over neutral areas for discussion during a press conference.

Just before the peace talks in Paris were due to open on 13 May 1968, Rusk advocated bombing North Vietnam north of the 20 parallel, a proposal strongly opposed by the Defense Secretary Clark Clifford who stated it would wreck the peace talks. Clifford persuaded a reluctant Johnson to stick by his promise of 31 March 1968 of no bombing north of 20 parallel. Rusk continued his advocacy of bombing north of 20 parallel, telling Johnson on 21 May 1968 &quot;We will not get a solution in Paris until we prove they can&#x27;t win in the South&quot;. During a meeting on 26 July 1968, Johnson briefed all three presidential candidates about the state of the war and the peace talks. Rusk who attended the meeting agreed with Richard Nixon&#x27;s statement that bombing provided leverage in the Paris peace talks, saying: &quot;If the North Vietnamese were not being bombed, they would have no incentive to do anything&quot;. When Nixon asked &quot;Where was the war lost?&quot;, Rusk replied: &quot;In the editorial rooms of this country&quot;.

On June 26, Rusk assured Berlin citizens that the United States along with its North Atlantic Treaty partners were &quot;determined&quot; in securing Berlin&#x27;s liberty and security, additionally criticizing the recent travel restrictions of East Germany as violating &quot;long standing agreements and practice&quot;.

On September 30, Rusk met privately with Foreign Minister of Israel Abba Eban in New York City for discussion on peace plans from the Middle East.

In October 1968, when Johnson considered a complete bombing halt to North Vietnam, Rusk was opposed. On November 1, Rusk said long term allies of the North Vietnam bomb halt should pressure Hanoi to accelerate their involvement in the peace talks in Paris.

===End of term===
Nixon won the election and Rusk prepared to leave office January 20, 1969. On December 1, 1968, citing the halt of bombing in North Vietnam, Rusk said that the Soviet Union would need to come forward and do what it could to forward peace talks in southeast Asia. On December 22, Rusk appeared on television to officially confirm the 82 surviving crew members of the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; intelligence ship, speaking on behalf of the hospitalized President Johnson.

In the last days of the Johnson administration, the president wanted to nominate Rusk to the Supreme Court. Although Rusk had studied the law, he did not have a law degree nor had he ever practiced law, but Johnson pointed out that the constitution did not require legal experience to serve on the Supreme Court and &quot;I&#x27;ve already talked to Dick Russell and he said you&#x27;d be confirmed easily.&quot; However, Johnson failed to reckon with Senator James Eastland, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was also a white supremacist and a supporter of segregation. Though Eastland was a fellow Southerner, he had neither forgotten nor forgiven Rusk for allowing his daughter to marry a black man. Eastland announced he would not confirm Rusk if he were nominated to the Supreme Court.

On January 2, 1969, Rusk met with five Jewish American leaders in his office to assure them the US had not changed its policy in the Middle East of recognizing the sovereignty of Israel. One of the leaders, the American-Israeli Public Affairs committee&#x27;s Irving Kane, said afterward that Rusk had successfully convinced him.

==Retirement==

January 20, 1969 marked Rusk&#x27;s last day as Secretary of State, and upon leaving Foggy Bottom he delivered a brief valedictory: &quot;Eight years ago, Mrs. Rusk and I came quietly. We wish now to leave quietly. Thank you very much&quot;. At a farewell dinner hosted by Dobrynin, the longest-serving ambassador in Washington, Rusk told his host: &quot;What&#x27;s done cannot be undone.&quot; After the dinner, Rusk drove away in a modest car that barely seemed to be working, which Dobrynin considered to an apt symbolic end to the Johnson administration. Upon his return to Georgia, Rusk suffered from a prolonged bout of depression and suffered from psychosomatic illnesses, visiting doctors with complaints of chest and stomach pains that appeared to have no physical basis. Unable to work, Rusk was supported throughout 1969 by the Rockefeller Foundation who paid him a salary as a &quot;distinguished fellow&quot;.   

On July 27, 1969, Rusk voiced his support for the Nixon administration&#x27;s proposed anti-ballistic missile system, saying that he would vote for it, were he a senator, from an understanding that further proposals would be reviewed if any progress would be made in Soviet Union peace talks. The same year, Rusk received both the Sylvanus Thayer Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Distinction.

Following his retirement, he taught international law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens, Georgia (1970–1984). Rusk was emotionally exhausted after 8 years as Secretary of State and narrowly survived a nervous breakdown in 1969. Roy Harris, a university regent who served as the Georgia campaign manager for the presidential campaign of George Wallace in 1968, tried to block Rusk&#x27;s appointment under the ostensible grounds &quot;We don&#x27;t want the university to be a haven for broken-down politicians&quot;, but in reality because he was opposed to a man who had allowed his daughter to marry a black man. However, Harris&#x27;s vote was overruled. Rusk found that the return to teaching in 1970 and the resumption of the academic career he had abandoned in 1940 was emotionally satisfying. The other professors remembered him as being like a &quot;junior associate seeking tenure&quot;. Rusk told his son &quot;the students I was privileged to teach helped rejuvenate my life and make a new start after those hard years in Washington.&quot;

In the 1970s, Rusk was a member of the Committee on Present Danger, a hawkish group opposed to détente with the Soviet Union and distrustful of treaties to control the nuclear arms race.

In 1973, Rusk eulogized Johnson when he lay in state.

In 1984, Rusk&#x27;s son Richard, whom he had not spoken to since 1970 owing to the opposition of Rusk &quot;fils&quot; to the Vietnam War, surprised his father by returning to Georgia from Alaska to seek a reconciliation. As part of the reconciliation process, Rusk, who had gone blind by this point, agreed to dictate his memoirs to his son, who recorded what he said and wrote it down into what became the book &quot;As I Saw It&quot;.

===Rusk&#x27;s memoir===
In a review of his memoir &quot;As I Saw It&quot;, the American historian Warren Cohen noted that little of the acrimony of Rusk&#x27;s relations with McNamara, Bundy and Fulbright appeared, but that Rusk was unremittingly hostile in his picture of Kennedy&#x27;s closest adviser and right-hand man, his younger brother Robert, together with the UN Secretary General U Thant. In &quot;As I Saw It&quot;, Rusk expressed considerable anger at the media&#x27;s coverage of the Vietnam War, accusing anti-war journalists of &quot;faking&quot; stories and images that portrayed the war in an unflattering light. Rusk spoke about what he called the &quot;so-called freedom of the press&quot;, as he maintained that journalists from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; only wrote what their editors told them to write, saying, if there were true freedom of the press, both newspapers would have portrayed the war more positively. Despite his hawkish views towards the Soviet Union, Rusk stated during his time as Secretary of State that he never saw any evidence that the Soviet Union planned to invade Western Europe and he &quot;seriously doubted&quot; that it ever would. Cohen noted that in contrast to his years with Kennedy, Rusk was warmer and more protective towards Johnson, whom he clearly got on better with than he ever did with Kennedy.

In a review of &quot;As I Saw It&quot;, the historian George C. Herring wrote that the book was mostly dull and uninformative when it came to Rusk&#x27;s time as Secretary of State, telling little that historians did not already know, and the most interesting and passionate parts concerned his youth in the &quot;Old South&quot; and his conflict and reconciliation with his son Richard.

Rusk died of heart failure in Athens, Georgia, on December 20, 1994, at the age of 85. He and his wife are buried at the Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens.

Rusk Eating House, the first women&#x27;s eating house at Davidson College, was founded in 1977 and is named in his honor. The Dean Rusk International Studies Program at Davidson College is also named in his honor.

Dean Rusk Middle School, located in Canton, Georgia, was named in his honor, as was Dean Rusk Hall on the campus of the University of Georgia.

==Legacy==
The consensus of historians is that Rusk was a very intelligent man, but very shy and so deeply immersed in details and the complexities of each case that he was reluctant to make a decision and unable to clearly explain to the media what the government&#x27;s policies were. Jonathan Coleman says that he was deeply involved in the Berlin Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, NATO, and the Vietnam War. Typically he was highly cautious on most issues, except for Vietnam:
Regarding Vietnam, historians agree that President Johnson relied heavily on the advice of Rusk, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, and national security adviser McGeorge Bundy to the effect that a communist takeover of all of Vietnam was unacceptable, and the only way to prevent it was to escalate America&#x27;s commitment. Johnson took their conclusions and rejected dissenting views.

Rusk&#x27;s son Rich wrote about his father&#x27;s time as Secretary of State: &quot;With this reticent, reserved, self-contained, emotionally bound-up father of mine from rural Georgia, how could the decision making have gone any differently? His taciturn qualities, which served him so well in negotiating with the Russians, ill-prepared him for the wrenching, introspective, soul-shattering journey that a true reappraisal of Vietnam policy would have involved. Although trained for high office, he was unprepared for such a journey, for admitting that thousands of American lives, and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, might have been lost in vain.&quot;

George Herring wrote about Rusk in 1992: &quot;He is a man utterly without pretense, a thoroughly decent individual, a man of stern countenance and unbending principles. He is a man with a passion for secrecy. He is a shy and reticent man, who as Secretary of State sipped scotch to loosen his tongue for press conferences. Stolid and normally laconic, he also has a keen, dry wit. He has often been described as the &#x27;perfect number two,&#x27; a loyal subordinate who had strong—if unexpressed—reservations about the Bay of Pigs operation, but after its failure could defend it as though he had planned it.&quot;

Summarizing the views of historians and political scientists, Smith Simpson states:
:Here was a man who had much going for him but failed in crucial respects. A decent, intelligent, well-educated man of broad experience in world affairs who, early in life, evidenced qualities of leadership, seemed diffidently to hold back rather than to lead as secretary of state, seeming to behave, in important ways, like a sleeve-plucking follower of presidents rather than their wise and persuasive counselor.

==In Popular Culture==
Marvel Comics features a fictionalized version of Dean Rusk named &quot;Dell Rusk,&quot; a corrupt politician later revealed to be an alter-ego of the supervillain Red Skull. This is foreshadowed by the fact that Dell Rusk is an anagram of Red Skull.

The character of Dell Rusk also appears in the video game , in which he is a member of the World Security Council that controls S.H.I.E.L.D.. This iteration of Dell Rusk appears to be a distinct character rather than a disguise used by Red Skull.

<doc id="80207" wikidata="Q2314" url="?curid=80207" title="Sodium chloride">
<text>Sodium chloride , commonly known as edible salt, is an ionic compound with the chemical formula NaCl, representing a 1:1 ratio of sodium and chlorine ions. It is transparent or translucent, brittle, hygroscopic, and occurs as the mineral halite. In its edible form, it is commonly used as a condiment and food preservative. Large quantities of sodium chloride are used in many industrial processes, and it is a major source of sodium and chlorine compounds used as feedstocks for further chemical syntheses. Another major application of sodium chloride is deicing of roadways in sub-freezing weather.
==Uses==
In addition to the many familiar domestic uses of salt, more dominant applications of the approximately 250 million tonnes per year production (2008 data) include chemicals and de-icing.

===Chemical functions===
Salt is used, directly or indirectly, in the production of many chemicals, which consume most of the world&#x27;s production.

====Chlor-alkali industry====

It is the starting point for the chloralkali process, the industrial process to produce chlorine and sodium hydroxide, according to the chemical equation
:&lt;chem&gt;2 NaCl + 2 H2O -&gt;[electrolysis] Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH&lt;/chem&gt;

This electrolysis is conducted in either a mercury cell, a diaphragm cell, or a membrane cell. Each of those uses a different method to separate the chlorine from the sodium hydroxide. Other technologies are under development due to the high energy consumption of the electrolysis, whereby small improvements in the efficiency can have large economic paybacks. Some applications of chlorine include PVC thermoplastics production, disinfectants, and solvents.

Sodium hydroxide is extensively used in many different industries enabling production of paper, soap, and aluminium etc.

===Soda-ash industry===
Sodium chloride is used in the Solvay process to produce sodium carbonate and calcium chloride. Sodium carbonate, in turn, is used to produce glass, sodium bicarbonate, and dyes, as well as a myriad of other chemicals. In the Mannheim process, sodium chloride is used for the production of sodium sulfate and hydrochloric acid.

===Miscellaneous industrial uses===
Sodium chloride is heavily used, so even relatively minor applications can consume massive quantities. In oil and gas exploration, salt is an important component of drilling fluids in well drilling. It is used to flocculate and increase the density of the drilling fluid to overcome high downwell gas pressures. Whenever a drill hits a salt formation, salt is added to the drilling fluid to saturate the solution in order to minimize the dissolution within the salt stratum. Salt is also used to increase the curing of concrete in cemented casings.

In textiles and dyeing, salt is used as a brine rinse to separate organic contaminants, to promote &quot;salting out&quot; of dyestuff precipitates, and to blend with concentrated dyes to increase yield in dyebaths and make the colors look sharper. One of its main roles is to provide the positive ion charge to promote the absorption of negatively charged ions of dyes.

For use in the pulp and paper industry, it is used to manufacture sodium chlorate, which is then reacted with sulfuric acid and a reducing agent such as methanol to manufacture chlorine dioxide, a bleaching chemical that is widely used to bleach wood pulp.

In tanning and leather treatment, salt is added to animal hides to inhibit microbial activity on the underside of the hides and to attract moisture back into the hides.

In rubber manufacture, salt is used to make buna, neoprene, and white rubber types. Salt brine and sulfuric acid are used to coagulate an emulsified latex made from chlorinated butadiene.

Salt also is added to secure the soil and to provide firmness to the foundation on which highways are built. The salt acts to minimize the effects of shifting caused in the subsurface by changes in humidity and traffic load.

===Water softening===

Hard water contains calcium and magnesium ions that interfere with action of soap and contribute to the buildup of a scale or film of alkaline mineral deposits in household and industrial equipment and pipes. Commercial and residential water-softening units use ion-exchange resins to remove ions that cause the hardness. These resins are generated and regenerated using sodium chloride.

===Road salt===

The second major application of salt is for deicing and anti-icing of roads, both in grit bins and spread by winter service vehicles. In anticipation of snowfall, roads are optimally &quot;anti-iced&quot; with brine (concentrated solution of salt in water), which prevents bonding between the snow-ice and the road surface. This procedure obviates the heavy use of salt after the snowfall. For de-icing, mixtures of brine and salt are used, sometimes with additional agents such as calcium chloride and/or magnesium chloride. The use of salt or brine becomes ineffective below .
Salt for de-icing in the United Kingdom predominantly comes from a single mine in Winsford in Cheshire. Prior to distribution it is mixed with &lt;100 ppm of sodium ferrocyanide as an anticaking agent, which enables rock salt to flow freely out of the gritting vehicles despite being stockpiled prior to use. In recent years this additive has also been used in table salt. Other additives had been used in road salt to reduce the total costs. For example, in the US, a byproduct carbohydrate solution from sugar-beet processing was mixed with rock salt and adhered to road surfaces about 40% better than loose rock salt alone. Because it stayed on the road longer, the treatment did not have to be repeated several times, saving time and money.

In the technical terms of physical chemistry, the minimum freezing point of a water-salt mixture is for 23.31 wt% of salt. Freezing near this concentration is however so slow that the eutectic point of can be reached with about 25 wt% of salt.

====Environmental effects====
Road salt ends up in fresh-water bodies and could harm aquatic plants and animals by disrupting their osmoregulation ability. The omnipresence of salt in coastal areas poses a problem in any coating application, because trapped salts cause great problems in adhesion. Naval authorities and ship builders monitor the salt concentrations on surfaces during construction. Maximal salt concentrations on surfaces are dependent on the authority and application. The IMO regulation is mostly used and sets salt levels to a maximum of 50 mg/m2 soluble salts measured as sodium chloride. These measurements are done by means of a Bresle test. Salinization (increasing salinity, aka &quot;freshwater salinization syndrome&quot;) and subsequent increased metal leaching is an ongoing problem throughout North America and European fresh waterways.

In highway de-icing, salt has been associated with corrosion of bridge decks, motor vehicles, reinforcement bar and wire, and unprotected steel structures used in road construction. Surface runoff, vehicle spraying, and windblown salt also affect soil, roadside vegetation, and local surface water and groundwater supplies. Although evidence of environmental loading of salt has been found during peak usage, the spring rains and thaws usually dilute the concentrations of sodium in the area where salt was applied. A 2009 study found that approximately 70% of the road salt being applied in the Minneapolis-St Paul metro area is retained in the local watershed.

====Substitution====
Some agencies are substituting beer, molasses, and beet juice instead of road salt. Airlines utilize more glycol and sugar rather than salt-based solutions for deicing.

===Food industry and agriculture===

Salt is added to food, either by the food producer or by the consumer, as a flavor enhancer, preservative, binder, fermentation-control additive, texture-control agent, and color developer. The salt consumption in the food industry is subdivided, in descending order of consumption, into other food processing, meat packers, canning, baking, dairy, and grain mill products. Salt is added to promote color development in bacon, ham and other processed meat products. As a preservative, salt inhibits the growth of bacteria. Salt acts as a binder in sausages to form a binding gel made up of meat, fat, and moisture. Salt also acts as a flavor enhancer and as a tenderizer.

It is used as a cheap and safe desiccant because of its hygroscopic properties, making salting an effective method of food preservation historically; the salt draws water out of bacteria through osmotic pressure, keeping it from reproducing, a major source of food spoilage. Even though more effective desiccants are available, few are safe for humans to ingest. Many microorganisms cannot live in a salty environment: water is drawn out of their cells by osmosis. For this reason salt is used to preserve some foods, such as bacon, fish, or cabbage.

In many dairy industries, salt is added to cheese as a color-, fermentation-, and texture-control agent. The dairy subsector includes companies that manufacture creamery butter, condensed and evaporated milk, frozen desserts, ice cream, natural and processed cheese, and specialty dairy products. In canning, salt is primarily added as a flavor enhancer and preservative. It also is used as a carrier for other ingredients, dehydrating agent, enzyme inhibitor and tenderizer. In baking, salt is added to control the rate of fermentation in bread dough. It also is used to strengthen the gluten (the elastic protein-water complex in certain doughs) and as a flavor enhancer, such as a topping on baked goods. The food-processing category also contains grain mill products. These products consist of milling flour and rice and manufacturing cereal breakfast food and blended or prepared flour. Salt is also used a seasoning agent, e.g. in potato chips, pretzels, and cat and dog food.

Sodium chloride is used in veterinary medicine as emesis-causing agent. It is given as warm saturated solution. Emesis can also be caused by pharyngeal placement of small amount of plain salt or salt crystals.

For watering plants to use sodium chloride () as a fertilizer, moderate concentration is used to avoid potential toxicity: per liter is generally safe and effective for most plants.

===Medicine===

Sodium chloride is used together with water as one of the primary solutions for intravenous therapy. Nasal spray often contains a saline solution.

Sodium chloride is also available as an oral tablet, and is taken to treat low sodium levels.

===Firefighting===

Sodium chloride is the principal extinguishing agent in dry-powder fire extinguishers that are used on combustible metal fires, for metals such as magnesium, zirconium, titanium, and lithium (Class D extinguishers). The salt forms an oxygen-excluding crust that smothers the fire.

===Cleanser===
Since at least medieval times, people have used salt as a cleansing agent rubbed on household surfaces. It is also used in many brands of shampoo, toothpaste, and popularly to de-ice driveways and patches of ice.

===Infrared optics===
Sodium chloride crystals have a transmittance of at least 90% (through 1 mm) for infrared light having wavelengths in the range 0.2– 18 μm. They were used in optical components such as windows and lenses, where few non-absorbing alternatives existed in that spectral range. While inexpensive, NaCl crystals are soft and hygroscopic – when exposed to the water in ambient air, they gradually cover with &quot;frost&quot;. This limits application of NaCl to dry environments, vacuum-sealed areas, or short-term uses such as prototyping. Materials that are mechanically stronger and less sensitive to moisture, such as zinc selenide and chalcogenide glasses, more widely used than NaCl.

==Chemistry==

===Solid sodium chloride===

In solid sodium chloride, each ion is surrounded by six ions of the opposite charge as expected on electrostatic grounds. The surrounding ions are located at the vertices of a regular octahedron. In the language of close-packing, the larger chloride ions (167 pm in size) are arranged in a cubic array whereas the smaller sodium ions (116 pm) fill all the cubic gaps (octahedral voids) between them. This same basic structure is found in many other compounds and is commonly known as the NaCl structure or rock salt crystal structure. It can be represented as a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice with a two-atom basis or as two interpenetrating face centered cubic lattices. The first atom is located at each lattice point, and the second atom is located halfway between lattice points along the fcc unit cell edge.

Solid sodium chloride has a melting point of 801 °C and liquid sodium chloride boils at 1465 °C. Atomic-resolution real-time video imaging allows visualization of the initial stage of crystal nucleation of sodium chloride.

The Thermal conductivity of sodium chloride as a function of temperature has a maximum of 2.03 W/(cm K) at and decreases to 0.069 at . It also decreases with doping.
From cold (sub-freezing) solutions, salt crystallises with water of hydration as hydrohalite (the dihydrate NaCl·2).

In 2023, it was discovered that under pressure, sodium chloride can form the hydrates NaCl·8.5H2O and NaCl·13H2O.

===Aqueous solutions===

The attraction between the Na+ and Cl− ions in the solid is so strong that only highly polar solvents like water dissolve NaCl well.

When dissolved in water, the sodium chloride framework disintegrates as the Na+ and Cl− ions become surrounded by polar water molecules. These solutions consist of metal aquo complex with the formula [Na(H2O)8]+, with the Na–O distance of 250 pm. The chloride ions are also strongly solvated, each being surrounded by an average of six molecules of water. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from pure water. The eutectic point is for 23.31% mass fraction of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is near .

===pH of sodium chloride solutions===
The pH of a sodium chloride solution remains ≈7 due to the extremely weak basicity of the Cl− ion, which is the conjugate base of the strong acid HCl. In other words, NaCl has no effect on system pH in diluted solutions where the effects of ionic strength and activity coefficients are negligible.
===Stoichiometric and structure variants===
Common salt has a 1:1 molar ratio of sodium and chlorine. In 2013, compounds of sodium and chloride of different stoichiometries have been discovered; five new compounds were predicted (e.g., Na3Cl, Na2Cl, Na3Cl2, NaCl3, and NaCl7). The existence of some of them has been experimentally confirmed at high pressures and other conditions: cubic and orthorhombic NaCl3, two-dimensional metallic tetragonal Na3Cl and exotic hexagonal NaCl. This indicates that compounds violating chemical intuition are possible, in simple systems under non-ambient conditions.

==Occurrence==
Salt is found in the Earth&#x27;s crust as the mineral halite (rock salt), and a tiny amount exists as suspended sea salt particles in the atmosphere. These particles are the dominant cloud condensation nuclei far out at sea, which allow the formation of clouds in otherwise non-polluted air.

==Production==
Salt is currently mass-produced by evaporation of seawater or brine from brine wells and salt lakes. Mining of rock salt is also a major source. China is the world&#x27;s main supplier of salt. In 2017, world production was estimated at 280 million tonnes, the top five producers (in million tonnes) being China (68.0), United States (43.0), India (26.0), Germany (13.0), and Canada (13.0). Salt is also a byproduct of potassium mining.

<doc id="80208" wikidata="Q298793" url="?curid=80208" title="William Westmoreland">
<text>William Childs Westmoreland (26 March 1914 – 18 July 2005) was a United States Army general, most notably the commander of United States forces during the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1968. He served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1968 to 1972.

Westmoreland adopted a strategy of attrition against the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army, attempting to drain them of manpower and supplies. He also made use of the United States&#x27; edge in artillery and air power, both in tactical confrontations and in relentless strategic bombing of North Vietnam. Nevertheless, public support for the war eventually diminished, especially after the Battle of Khe Sanh and the Tet Offensive in 1968. By the time he was reassigned as Army Chief of Staff, United States military forces in Vietnam had reached a peak of 535,000 personnel.

Westmoreland&#x27;s strategy was ultimately politically and militarily unsuccessful. Growing United States casualties and the draft undermined United States support for the war, while large-scale casualties among non-combatants weakened South Vietnamese support.

==Early life and education==
Westmoreland was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina, on 26 March 1914 to Eugenia Talley Childs and James Ripley Westmoreland. His upper middle class family was involved in the local banking and textile industries. Eugenia&#x27;s aunt Bessie Springs Childs&#x27; lived with other influential family members in Columbia, South Carolina, owning property that would become the Visanska Starks House. The family operated Springs Industries (now Springs Global) railroads and utilities.

At the age of 15, William became an Eagle Scout in his Boy Scouts of America (BSA) local council&#x27;s Troop 1, and was recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo from the BSA as a young adult. After spending a year at The Citadel in 1932, he was appointed to attend the United States Military Academy on the nomination of Senator James F. Byrnes, a family friend.

Westmoreland said his motive for entering West Point was &quot;to see the world&quot;. He was a member of a distinguished West Point class that also included Creighton Abrams and Benjamin O. Davis Jr. Westmoreland graduated as First Captain, the highest cadet rank, and received the Pershing Sword, which is &quot;presented to the cadet with highest level of military proficiency&quot;. Westmoreland also served as the superintendent of the Protestant Sunday School Teachers.

==Military career==
Following graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1936, Westmoreland became an artillery officer and served in several assignments with the 18th Field Artillery at Fort Sill. In 1939, he was promoted to first lieutenant, after which he was a battery commander and battalion staff officer with the 8th Field Artillery at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. In World War II, Westmoreland saw combat with the 34th Field Artillery Regiment, 9th Infantry Division, in Tunisia, Sicily, France, and Germany; he commanded the 34th Battalion in Tunisia and Sicily. He reached the temporary wartime rank of colonel, and on 13 October 1944, was appointed the chief of staff of the 9th Infantry Division.

After the war, Westmoreland completed paratrooper training at the Army&#x27;s Jump School in 1946. He then commanded the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. From 1947 to 1950, he served as chief of staff for the 82nd Airborne Division. He was an instructor at the Command and General Staff College from August to October 1950 and at the newly organized Army War College from October 1950 to July 1952. From July 1952 to October 1953, Westmoreland commanded the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team in Japan and Korea. He was promoted to brigadier general in November 1952 at the age of 38, making him one of the youngest U.S. Army generals in the post-World War II era.

After returning to the United States in October 1953, Westmoreland was deputy assistant chief of staff, G–1, for manpower control on the Army staff until 1955. In 1954, Westmoreland completed a three-month management program at Harvard Business School. As historian Stanley Karnow noted, &quot;Westy was a corporation executive in uniform.&quot; From 1955 to 1958, he was the United States Army&#x27;s Secretary of the General Staff. He then commanded the 101st Airborne Division from 1958 to 1960. He was Superintendent of the United States Military Academy from 1960 to 1963. In 1962, Westmoreland was admitted as an honorary member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. He was promoted to lieutenant general in July 1963 and was Commanding General of the XVIII Airborne Corps from 1963 to 1964.

===Vietnam War: Background and overview===
The attempted French re-colonization of Vietnam following World War II culminated in a decisive French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. The Geneva Conference (26 April – 20 July 1954) discussed the possibility of restoring peace in Indochina, and temporarily separated Vietnam into two zones, a northern zone to be governed by the Việt Minh, and a southern zone to be governed by the State of Vietnam, then headed by former emperor Bảo Đại. A Conference Final Declaration, issued by the British chairman of the conference, provided that a general election be held by July 1956 to create a unified Vietnamese state. Although presented as a consensus view, this document was not accepted by the delegates of either the State of Vietnam or the United States.

In addition, China, the Soviet Union, and other communist nations recognized North Vietnam while the United States and other non-communist states recognized South Vietnam as the legitimate government. By the time Westmoreland became army commander in South Vietnam, the option of a Korea-type settlement with a large demilitarized zone separating north and south, favored by military and diplomatic figures, had been rejected by the U.S. government, whose objectives were to achieve a decisive victory and not to use vastly greater resources. The infiltration by regular North Vietnamese Army forces into the South could not be dealt with by aggressive action against the northern state because intervention by China was something the U.S. government wanted to avoid, but President Lyndon B. Johnson had given commitments to uphold South Vietnam against communist North Vietnam.

General Harold Keith Johnson, Army Chief of Staff, came to see U.S. goals as having become mutually inconsistent, because defeating the Communists would require declaring a national emergency and fully mobilizing the resources of the US. General Johnson was critical of Westmoreland&#x27;s defused corporate style, considering him overattentive to what government officials wanted to hear. Nonetheless, Westmoreland was operating within longstanding army protocols of subordinating the military to civilian policymakers. The most important constraint was staying on the strategic defensive out of fear of Chinese intervention, but at the same time Johnson had made it clear that there was a higher commitment to defending Vietnam. Much of the thinking about defense was by academics turned government advisors who concentrated on nuclear weapons, seen as making conventional war obsolete. The fashion for counter-insurgency thinking also denigrated the role of conventional warfare. Despite the inconclusive outcome of the Korean War, Americans expected the war to end with an unconditional surrender of the enemy.

A dramatic increase in direct American participation in the Vietnam War began in February and March 1965, with 184,300 military personnel in Vietnam by the end of the year. Viet Cong and PAVN strategy, organization and structure meant that Westmoreland faced a dual threat. Regular North Vietnamese army units infiltrating across the remote border were apparently concentrating to mount an offensive and Westmoreland considered this the danger that had to be tackled immediately. There was also entrenched guerrilla subversion throughout the heavily populated coastal regions by the Viet Cong. During this time, Westmoreland forbade the CIA from publishing a count of enemy fighters greater than 399,000, because admitting there were more than 600,000 fighters including guerrillas would have revealed that the insurgency had popular support. Consistent with the enthusiasm of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara for statistics, Westmoreland placed emphasis on body count and cited the Battle of Ia Drang as evidence the communists were losing.

The government sought to win at low cost, and policymakers received McNamara&#x27;s interpretation indicating huge American casualties in prospect, prompting a reassessment of what could be achieved. The Battle of Ia Drang was unusual in that U.S. troops brought a large enemy formation to battle. After talking to junior officers General Westmoreland became skeptical about localised concentrated search and destroy sweeps of short duration, because the Communist forces controlled whether there were military engagements, giving an option to simply avoid battle with US forces if the situation warranted it. The alternative of sustained countrywide pacification operations, which would require massive use of US manpower, was never available to Westmoreland, because it was considered politically unacceptable.

In public, Westmoreland continued to be sanguine about the progress being made throughout his time in Vietnam, though supportive journalist James Reston thought Westmoreland&#x27;s characterizing of the conflict as attrition warfare presented his generalship in a misleading light. Westmoreland&#x27;s critics say his successor, General Creighton Abrams, deliberately switched emphasis away from what Westmoreland dubbed attrition. Revisionists point to Abrams&#x27;s first big operation being a tactical success that disrupted North Vietnamese buildup, but resulted in the Battle of Hamburger Hill, a political disaster that effectively curtailed Abrams&#x27;s freedom to continue with such operations.

== Commander of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) ==
Westmoreland was sent to Vietnam in 1963. In January 1964, he became deputy commander of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), succeeding Paul D. Harkins as commander in June. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara told President Lyndon B. Johnson in April that Westmoreland was &quot;the best we have, without question&quot;. As the head of the MACV, he was known for highly publicized, positive assessments of US military prospects in Vietnam. In 1965, TIME named him man of the year. He was mentioned in another &quot;Time&quot; magazine article as a potential candidate for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination.
As time went on, the strengthening of communist combat forces in the South led to regular requests for increases in US troop strength, from 16,000 when Westmoreland arrived to its peak of 535,000 in 1968 when he was promoted to Chief of Staff of the US Army. On 28 April 1967, Westmoreland addressed a joint session of Congress. &quot;In evaluating the enemy strategy&quot;, he said, &quot;it is evident to me that he believes our Achilles heel is our resolve. ... Your continued strong support is vital to the success of our mission. ... Backed at home by resolve, confidence, patience, determination, and continued support, we will prevail in Vietnam over the communist aggressor!&quot; Westmoreland claimed that under his leadership, United States forces &quot;won every battle&quot;. The turning point of the war was the 1968 Tet Offensive, in which communist forces attacked cities and towns throughout South Vietnam. At the time, Westmoreland was focused on the Battle of Khe Sanh and considered the Tet Offensive to be a diversionary attack. It is not clear if Khe Sanh was meant to be distraction for the Tet Offensive or vice versa; sometimes this is called the Riddle of Khe Sanh. Regardless, US and South Vietnamese troops successfully fought off the attacks during the Tet Offensive, and the communist forces took heavy losses, but the ferocity of the assault shook public confidence in Westmoreland&#x27;s previous assurances about the state of the war. Political debate and public opinion led the Johnson administration to limit further increases in US troop numbers in Vietnam. Nine months afterward, when the My Lai Massacre reports started to break, Westmoreland resisted pressure from the incoming Nixon administration for a cover-up, and pressed for a full and impartial investigation by Lieutenant General William R. Peers. However, a few days after the tragedy, he had praised the same involved unit on the &quot;outstanding job&quot;, for the &quot;U.S. infantrymen had killed 128 Communists [&quot;sic&quot;] in a bloody day-long battle&quot;. Post 1969 Westmoreland also made efforts to investigate the Phong Nhị and Phong Nhất massacre a year after the event occurred.

Westmoreland was convinced that the Vietnamese communists could be destroyed by fighting a war of attrition that, theoretically, would render the North Vietnamese Army unable to fight. His war strategy was marked by heavy use of artillery and airpower and repeated attempts to engage the communists in large-unit battles, and thereby exploit the US&#x27;s vastly superior firepower and technology. Westmoreland&#x27;s response, to those Americans who criticized the high casualty rate of Vietnamese civilians, was: &quot;It does deprive the enemy of the population, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; However, the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF) were able to dictate the pace of attrition to fit their own goals: by continuing to fight a guerrilla war and avoiding large-unit battles, they denied the Americans the chance to fight the kind of war they were best at, and they ensured that attrition would wear down the American public&#x27;s support for the war faster than they.

Westmoreland repeatedly rebuffed or suppressed attempts by John Paul Vann and Lew Walt to shift to a &quot;pacification&quot; strategy. Westmoreland had little appreciation of the patience of the American public for his time frame, and was struggling to persuade President Johnson to approve widening the war into Cambodia and Laos in order to interdict the Ho Chi Minh trail. He was unable to use the absolutist stance that &quot;we can&#x27;t win unless we expand the war&quot;. Instead, he focused on &quot;positive indicators&quot;, which ultimately turned worthless when the Tet Offensive occurred, since all his pronouncements of &quot;positive indicators&quot; did not hint at the possibility of such a last-gasp dramatic event. Tet outmaneuvered all of Westmoreland&#x27;s pronouncements on &quot;positive indicators&quot; in the minds of the American public.

At one point in 1968, Westmoreland considered the use of nuclear weapons in Vietnam in a contingency plan codenamed Fracture Jaw, which was abandoned when it became known to the White House.

== Chief of Staff of the United States Army ==

In June 1968, Westmoreland was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to succeed General Harold K. Johnson as Chief of Staff of the United States Army. Shortly after the Tet Offensive, it was announced that General Creighton Abrams would succeed Westmoreland as commander of the MACV.

Westmoreland served as Chief of Staff from 1968 to 1972. In 1970, in response to the My Lai Massacre by US Army forces and the subsequent cover-up by the Army chain of command, he commissioned an investigation that compiled a comprehensive and seminal study of leadership within the Army during the Vietnam War demonstrating a severe erosion of adherence to the army&#x27;s officer code of &quot;Duty, Honor, Country&quot;. The report, entitled &quot;Study on Military Professionalism&quot;, had a profound influence on Army policies, beginning with Westmoreland&#x27;s decision to end the policy that officers serving in Vietnam would be rotated into a different post after only six months. However, to lessen the impact of this damaging report, Westmoreland ordered that the document be kept on &quot;close hold&quot; across the entire Army for a period of two years and not disseminated to War College attendees. The report became known to the public only after Westmoreland retired in 1972.

On September 21, 1970, Westmoreland became a rated Army Aviator, having successfully completed Army Aviation training at Ft. Campbell, then-Ft. Rucker, and Washington, DC.

Westmoreland tried to make Army life more attractive during the transition to the all-volunteer force by eliminating reveille formations at dawn, allowing beer to be served in mess halls during evening meals, omitting bed check, easing pass policies, and other directives.

Westmoreland&#x27;s tenure as Chief of Staff ended on 30 June 1972. He was offered the position of Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, but opted to retire on 30 June 1972. He was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal by President Richard Nixon.

==Later years==

Westmoreland ran unsuccessfully for Governor of South Carolina as a Republican in the 1974 election. He published his autobiography the following year. Westmoreland later served on a task force to improve educational standards in the state of South Carolina.

In 1986, Westmoreland served as grand marshal of the Chicago Vietnam Veterans parade. The parade, attended by 200,000 Vietnam veterans and more than half a million spectators, did much to repair the rift between Vietnam veterans and the American public.

==Westmoreland versus CBS: &quot;The Uncounted Enemy&quot;==
Mike Wallace interviewed Westmoreland for the CBS special &quot;The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception&quot;. The documentary, shown on 23 January 1982, and prepared largely by CBS producer George Crile III, alleged that Westmoreland and others had deliberately understated Viet Cong troop strength during 1967 in order to maintain US troop morale and domestic support for the war. Westmoreland filed a lawsuit against CBS.

In &quot;Westmoreland v. CBS&quot;, Westmoreland sued Wallace and CBS for libel, and a lengthy legal process began. Just days before the lawsuit was to go to the jury, Westmoreland settled with CBS, and they issued a joint statement of understanding. Some contend that Judge Leval&#x27;s instructions to the jury over what constituted &quot;actual malice&quot; to prove libel convinced Westmoreland&#x27;s lawyers that he was certain to lose. Others point out that the settlement occurred after two of Westmoreland&#x27;s former intelligence officers, Major General Joseph McChristian and Colonel Gains Hawkins, testified to the accuracy of the substantive allegations of the broadcast, which were that Westmoreland ordered changes in intelligence reports on Viet Cong troop strengths for political reasons. Disagreements persist about the appropriateness of some of the methods of CBS&#x27;s editors.

A deposition by McChristian indicates that his organization developed improved intelligence on the number of irregular Viet Cong combatants shortly before he left Vietnam on a regularly scheduled rotation. The numbers troubled Westmoreland, who feared that the press would not understand them. He did not order them changed, but instead did not include the information in reporting to Washington, which in his view was not appropriate to report.

Based on later analysis of the information from all sides, it appears clear that Westmoreland could not sustain a libel suit because CBS&#x27;s principal allegation was that he had caused intelligence officers to suppress facts. Westmoreland&#x27;s anger was caused by the implication of the broadcast that his intent was fraudulent and that he ordered others to lie. The reality was complicated. Westmoreland had made it clear to his subordinates that he preferred low estimates of enemy strength. His chief of intelligence, Brigadier General Phillip Davidson, responded by ordering his subordinates to produce low estimates, but said he believed those low estimates would in fact be valid. The officers who acknowledged openly that the low estimates they produced were lies were at the rank of colonel and below. 

During the acrimonious trial, Mike Wallace was hospitalized for depression, and despite the legal conflict separating the two, Westmoreland and his wife sent him flowers. Wallace&#x27;s memoir is generally sympathetic to Westmoreland, although he makes it clear he disagreed with him on issues surrounding the Vietnam War and the Nixon Administration&#x27;s policies in Southeast Asia.

==Views on the Vietnam War==

In a 1998 interview for &quot;George&quot; magazine, Westmoreland criticized the battlefield prowess of his direct opponent, North Vietnamese general Võ Nguyên Giáp. &quot;Of course, he [Giap] was a formidable adversary&quot;, Westmoreland told correspondent W. Thomas Smith Jr. &quot;Let me also say that Giap was trained in small-unit, guerrilla tactics, but he persisted in waging a big-unit war with terrible losses to his own men. By his own admission, by early 1969, I think, he had lost, what, a half million soldiers? He reported this. Now such a disregard for human life may make a formidable adversary, but it does not make a military genius. An American commander losing men like that would hardly have lasted more than a few weeks.&quot; In the 1974 film &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot;, Westmoreland opined that &quot;The Oriental doesn&#x27;t put the same high price on life as does a Westerner. Life is plentiful, life is cheap in the Orient. And as the philosophy of the Orient expresses it: Life is not important.&quot;

Westmoreland&#x27;s view has been heavily criticized by Nick Turse, the author of the book &quot;Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam&quot;. Turse said that many of the Vietnamese killed were actually innocent civilians, and the Vietnamese casualties were not just caused by military cross-fire but were a direct result of the US policy and tactics, for example the policy &quot;kill everything that moves&quot; which enabled the US soldiers to shoot civilians for &quot;suspicious behavior&quot;. He concluded that, after having &quot;spoken to survivors of massacres by United States forces at Phi Phu, Trieu Ai, My Luoc and so many other hamlets, I can say with certainty that Westmoreland&#x27;s assessment was false&quot;. He also accused Westmoreland of concealing evidence of atrocities from the American public when he was the Army Chief of Staff.

Historian Derek Frisby also criticized Westmoreland&#x27;s view during an interview with Deutsche Welle:

For the remainder of his life, Westmoreland maintained that the United States did not lose the war in Vietnam; he stated instead that &quot;our country did not fulfill its commitment to South Vietnam. By virtue of Vietnam, the U.S. held the line for 10 years and stopped the dominoes from falling.&quot;

==Personal life==
Westmoreland first met his future wife, Katherine (Kitsy) Stevens Van Deusen (1927-2021), while stationed at Fort Sill. She was the daughter of the post executive officer, Colonel Edwin R. Van Deusen. Westmoreland met her again in North Carolina when she was nineteen and a student at University of North Carolina at Greensboro. The couple married in May 1947 and had three children: a daughter, Katherine Stevens; a son, James Ripley II, and another daughter, Margaret Childs.

Just hours after Westmoreland was sworn in as Army Chief of Staff on July 7, 1968, his brother-in-law, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Van Deusen, commander of 2nd Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment, was killed when his helicopter was shot down in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam.

==Death==
Westmoreland died on 18 July 2005, at the age of 91 at the Bishop Gadsden retirement home in Charleston, South Carolina. He had suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease during the final years of his life. He was buried on 23 July 2005, at the West Point Cemetery.

<doc id="80219" wikidata="Q382317" url="?curid=80219" title="Dodona">
<text>Dodona (; , Ionic and , ) in Epirus in northwestern Greece was the oldest Hellenic oracle, possibly dating to the 2nd millennium BCE according to Herodotus. The earliest accounts in Homer describe Dodona as an oracle of Zeus. Situated in a remote region away from the main Greek poleis, it was considered second only to the Oracle of Delphi in prestige.

Aristotle considered the region around Dodona to have been part of Hellas and the region where the Hellenes originated. The oracle was first under the control of the Thesprotians before it passed into the hands of the Molossians. It remained an important religious sanctuary until the rise of Christianity during the Late Roman era.

==Description==
During classical antiquity, according to various accounts, priestesses and priests in the sacred grove interpreted the rustling of the oak (or beech) leaves to determine the correct actions to be taken. According to a new interpretation, the oracular sound originated from bronze objects hanging from oak branches and sounded with the wind blowing, similar to a wind chime.

According to Nicholas Hammond, Dodona was an oracle devoted to a Mother Goddess (identified at other sites with Rhea or Gaia, but here called Dione) who was joined and partly supplanted in historical times by the Greek deity Zeus.

==History==

===Early history===

Although the earliest inscriptions at the site date to c. 550–500 BCE, archaeological excavations conducted for more than a century have recovered artifacts as early as the Mycenaean era, many now at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, and some in the archaeological museum at nearby Ioannina. There was an ancient tradition that Dodona was founded as a colony from the city, also named Dodona, in Thessaly.

Cult activity at Dodona was already established in some form during the Late Bronze Age (or Mycenaean period). Mycenaean offerings such as bronze objects of the 14th and 13th centuries were brought in Dodona. A 13th century cist tomb with squared shoulders was found at Dodona; it had no context, but a Mycenaean sherd of c. 1200 B.C. was also unearthed on the site, in association with kylix stems. Archaeological evidence shows that the cult of Zeus was established around the same time. During the post-Mycenaean period (or &quot;Greek Dark Ages&quot;), evidence of activity at Dodona is scant, but there is a resumption of contact between Dodona and southern Greece during the Archaic period (8th century BCE) with the presence of bronze votive offerings (i.e. tripods) from southern Greek cities. Dedication to the Oracle of Dodona arrived from most of the Greek world including its colonies. Although an adjacent area there were few Illyrian dedication most probably because the Oracle preferred interaction with the Greek world. Until 650 BCE, Dodona was a religious and oracular centre mainly for northern tribes; only after 650 BCE did it become important for the southern tribes.

Zeus was worshipped at Dodona as &quot;Zeus Naios&quot; or &quot;Naos&quot; (god of the spring below the oak in the &quot;temenos&quot; or sanctuary, cf. Naiads) and as &quot;Zeus Bouleus&quot; (Counsellor). According to Plutarch, the worship of Jupiter (Zeus) at Dodona was set up by Deucalion and Pyrrha.

The earliest mention of Dodona is in Homer, and only Zeus is mentioned in this account. In the &quot;Iliad&quot; (circa 750 BCE), Achilles prays to &quot;High Zeus, Lord of Dodona, Pelasgian, living afar off, brooding over wintry Dodona&quot; (thus demonstrating that Zeus also could be invoked from a distance). No buildings are mentioned, and the priests (called &quot;Selloi&quot;) slept on the ground with unwashed feet. No priestesses are mentioned in Homer.

The oracle also features in another passage involving Odysseus, giving a story of his visit to Dodona. Odysseus&#x27;s words &quot;bespeak a familiarity with Dodona, a realization of its importance, and an understanding that it was normal to consult Zeus there on a problem of personal conduct.&quot;

The details of this story are as follows. Odysseus says to the swineherd Eumaeus (possibly giving him a fictive account) that he (Odysseus) was seen among the Thesprotians, having gone to inquire of the oracle at Dodona whether he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret (as the disguised Odysseus is doing). Odysseus later repeats the same tale to Penelope, who may not yet have seen through his disguise.

According to some scholars, Dodona was originally an oracle of the Mother Goddess attended by priestesses. She was identified at other sites as Rhea or Gaia. The oracle also was shared by Dione. By classical times, Dione was relegated to a minor role elsewhere in classical Greece, being made into an aspect of Zeus&#x27;s more usual consort, Hera — but never at Dodona.

Many dedicatory inscriptions recovered from the site mention both &quot;Dione&quot; and &quot;Zeus Naios&quot;.

According to some archaeologists, it was not until the 4th century BCE that a small stone temple to Dione was added to the site. By the time Euripides mentioned Dodona (fragmentary play &quot;Melanippe&quot;) and Herodotus wrote about the oracle, the priestesses had appeared at the site.

Over 4200 oracular tablets have been found in Dodona, written in different alphabets, and dated approximately between the mid-6th and early 2nd centuries BCE. All the texts were written in Greek, and attest to over 1200 personal names from different areas; these were almost exclusively Greek, with non-Greek names (e.g. Thracian, Illyrian) making up around 1% of the total.

===Classical and Hellenistic Greece===
Though it never eclipsed the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, Dodona gained a reputation far beyond Greece. In the &quot;Argonautica&quot; of Apollonius of Rhodes, a retelling of an older story of Jason and the Argonauts, Jason&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Argo&quot;, had the gift of prophecy, because it contained an oak timber spirited from Dodona.

In c. 290 BCE, King Pyrrhus made Dodona the religious capital of his domain and beautified it by implementing a series of construction projects (i.e. grandly rebuilt the Temple of Zeus, developed many other buildings, added a festival featuring athletic games, musical contests, and drama enacted in a theatre). A wall was built around the oracle itself and the holy tree, as well as temples to Dione and Heracles.

In 219 BCE, the Aetolians, under the leadership of General Dorimachus, looted and set fire to the sanctuary. During the late 3rd century BCE, King Philip V of Macedon (along with the Epirotes) reconstructed all the buildings at Dodona. In 167 BCE, the Molossian cities and possibly Dodona itself were destroyed by the Romans (led by Aemilius Paulus). A fragment of Dio Cassius reports that Thracian soldiers instigated by King Mithridates sacked the sanctuary ca. 88 BCE. In the reign of the emperor Augustus the site was prominent enough to feature an honorary statue of Livia. The 2nd century CE traveller Pausanias noted a sacred oak tree of Zeus. In 241 CE, a priest named Poplius Memmius Leon organized the Naia festival of Dodona. In 362 CE, Emperor Julian consulted the oracle prior to his military campaigns against the Persians.

Pilgrims still consulted the oracle until 391-392 CE when Emperor Theodosius closed all pagan temples, banned all pagan religious activities, and cut down the ancient oak tree at the sanctuary of Zeus. Although the surviving town was insignificant, the long-hallowed pagan site must have retained significance for Christians given that a bishop of Dodona named Theodorus attended the First Council of Ephesus in 431 CE.

==Herodotus==
Herodotus (&quot;Histories&quot; 2:54–57) was told by priests at Egyptian Thebes in the 5th century BCE &quot;that two priestesses had been carried away from Thebes by Phoenicians; one, they said they had heard was taken away and sold in Libya, the other in Hellas; these women, they said, were the first founders of places of divination in the aforesaid countries.&quot; The simplest analysis of the quote is: Egypt, for Greeks as well as for Egyptians, was a spring of human culture of all but immeasurable antiquity. This mythic element says that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted by Phoenician culture, and that the seeresses – Herodotus does not say &quot;sibyls&quot; – were women.

Herodotus follows with what he was told by the prophetesses, called &quot;peleiades&quot; (&quot;doves&quot;) at Dodona:
In the simplest analysis, this was a confirmation of the oracle tradition in Egypt. The element of the dove may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense and the eventual connection with Zeus, justified by a tale told by a priestess. Was the &quot;pel-&quot; element in their name connected with &quot;black&quot; or &quot;muddy&quot; root elements in names like &quot;Peleus&quot; or &quot;Pelops&quot;? Is that why the doves were black?

Herodotus adds:

Thesprotia, on the coast west of Dodona, would have been available to the seagoing Phoenicians, whom readers of Herodotus would not have expected to have penetrated as far inland as Dodona.

==Strabo==
According to Strabo, the oracle was founded by the Pelasgi:
This oracle, according to Ephorus, was founded by the Pelasgi. And the Pelasgi are called the earliest of all peoples who have held dominion in Greece.
The site of the oracle was dominated by Mount Tomaros, the area being controlled by the Thesprotians and then the Molossians:
In ancient times, then, Dodona was under the rule of the Thesprotians; and so was Mount Tomaros, or Tmaros (for it is called both ways), at the base of which the temple is situated. And both the tragic poets and Pindaros have called Dodona &#x27;Thesprotian Dodona.&#x27; But later on it came under the rule of the Molossoi.
According to Strabo, the prophecies were originally uttered by men:
At the outset, it is true, those who uttered the prophecies were men (this too perhaps the poet indicates, for he calls them “hypophetae” [interpreters] and the prophets might be ranked among these), but later on three old women were designated as prophets, after Dione also had been designated as temple-associate of Zeus.
Strabo also reports as uncertain the story that the predecessor of Dodona oracle was located in Thessaly:
...the temple [oracle] was transferred from Thessaly, from the part of Pelasgia which is about Scotussa (and Scotussa does belong to the territory called Thessalia Pelasgiotis), and also that most of the women whose descendants are the prophetesses of today went along at the same time; and it is from this fact that Zeus was also called “Pelasgian.”
In a fragment of Strabo we find the following:
Among the Thesprotians and the Molossians old women are called &quot;peliai&quot; and old men &quot;pelioi,&quot; as is also the case among the Macedonians; at any rate, those people call their dignitaries &quot;peligones&quot; (compare the &quot;gerontes&quot; among the Laconians and the Massaliotes). And this, it is said, is the origin of the myth about the pigeons [peleiades] in the Dodonaean oak-tree.
== Other commentaries ==
According to Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb, the epithet &quot;Neuos&quot; of Zeus at Dodona primarily designated &quot;the god of streams, and, generally, of water&quot;. Jebb also points out that Achelous, as a water deity, received special honours at Dodona. The area of the oracle was quite swampy, with lakes in the area and reference to the &quot;holy spring&quot; of Dodona may be a later addition.

Jebb mostly follows Strabo in his analysis. Accordingly, he notes that the Selloi, the prophets of Zeus, were also called &quot;tomouroi&quot;, which name derived from Mount Tomares. &quot;Tomouroi&quot; was also a variant reading found in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

According to Jebb, the Peleiades at Dodona were very early, and preceded the appointment of Phemonoe, the prophetess at Delphi. The introduction of female attendants probably took place in the fifth century. The timing of change is clearly prior to Herodotus (5th century BCE), with his narrative about the doves and Egypt.

Aristotle (&quot;Meteorologica&quot;, 1.14) places &#x27;Hellas&#x27; in the parts about Dodona and the Achelous and says it was inhabited by &quot;the Selloi, who were formerly called Graikoi, but now Hellenes.&quot;

The alternative reading of &quot;Selloi&quot; is &quot;Helloi&quot;. Aristotle clearly uses &quot;Dodona&quot; as the designation of the whole district in which the oracle was situated. Thus, according to some scholars, the origin of the words &quot;Hellenes&quot; and &quot;Hellas&quot; was from Dodona. Also, the word &quot;Greece&quot; may have been derived from this area.

<text>Peleiades (Greek: , &quot;doves&quot;) were the sacred women of Zeus and the Mother Goddess, Dione, at the Oracle at Dodona. Pindar made a reference to the Pleiades as the &quot;peleiades&quot; a flock of doves, but the connection seems witty and poetical, rather than mythic. The chariot of Aphrodite was drawn by a flock of doves, however. A mythic element of a black dove that initiated the oracle at Dodona, which Herodotus was told in the 5th century BC may be an attempt to account for a folk etymology applied to the archaic name of the sacred women that no longer made sense (an aitiological myth). Perhaps the &quot;pel-&quot; element in their name was originally connected with &quot;black&quot; or &quot;muddy&quot; root elements in names like Peleus or Pelops and peliganes (Epirotian, Macedonian senators), Attic &quot;polios&quot;, Doric &quot;peleios&quot; grey, old, PIE *pel-, &quot;gray&quot;. Peleiades are often confused with the nymphs Pleiades.

<text>Robert Strange McNamara (; June 9, 1916 – July 6, 2009) was an American businessman and government official who served as the eighth United States secretary of defense from 1961 to 1968 under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson at the height of the Cold War. He remains the longest-serving secretary of defense, having remained in office over seven years. He played a major role in promoting the U.S.&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War. McNamara was responsible for the institution of systems analysis in public policy, which developed into the discipline known today as policy analysis.

McNamara was born in San Francisco, California, and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley and Harvard Business School. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After World War II, Henry Ford II hired McNamara and a group of other Army Air Force veterans to work for Ford Motor Company. These &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; helped reform Ford with modern planning, organization, and management control systems. After briefly serving as Ford&#x27;s president, McNamara accepted appointment as secretary of defense.

McNamara became a close adviser to Kennedy and advocated the use of a blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy and McNamara instituted a Cold War defense strategy of flexible response, which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. McNamara consolidated intelligence and logistics functions of the Pentagon into two centralized agencies: the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Supply Agency. During the Kennedy administration, McNamara presided over a build-up of U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam escalated dramatically. McNamara and other U.S. policymakers feared that the fall of South Vietnam to a Communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region.

McNamara grew increasingly skeptical of the efficacy of committing U.S. troops to South Vietnam. In 1968, he resigned as secretary of defense to become president of the World Bank. He served as president until 1981, shifting the focus of the World Bank from infrastructure and industrialization towards poverty reduction. After retiring, he served as a trustee of several organizations, including the California Institute of Technology and the Brookings Institution. In his later writings and interviews, he expressed regret for the decisions he made during the Vietnam War.

==Early life and career==
Robert McNamara was born in San Francisco, California. His father was Robert James McNamara, sales manager of a wholesale shoe company, and his mother was Clara Nell (Strange) McNamara. His father&#x27;s family was Irish and, in about 1850, following the Great Irish Famine, had emigrated to the U.S., first to Massachusetts and later to California. He graduated from Piedmont High School in Piedmont, California in 1933, where he was president of the Rigma Lions boys club and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. McNamara attended the University of California, Berkeley and graduated in 1937 with a B.A. in economics with minors in mathematics and philosophy. He was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in his sophomore year, and earned a varsity letter in crew. Before commissioning into the Army Air Force, McNamara was a Cadet in the Golden Bear Battalion at U.C. Berkeley. McNamara was also a member of the UC Berkeley&#x27;s Order of the Golden Bear, a fellowship of students and leading faculty members formed to promote leadership within the student body. He then attended Harvard Business School, where he earned an MBA in 1939.

Immediately thereafter, McNamara worked for a year at Price Waterhouse, a San Francisco accounting firm. He returned to Harvard in August 1940 to teach accounting in the Business School and became the institution&#x27;s highest-paid and youngest assistant professor at that time. 

==World War II==
Following his involvement in a Harvard program to teach analytical approaches used in business to officers of the United States Army Air Forces, McNamara entered the USAAF as a captain in early 1943, serving most of World War II with its Office of Statistical Control. One of his major responsibilities was the analysis of U.S. bombers&#x27; efficiency and effectiveness, especially the B-29 forces commanded by Major General Curtis LeMay in India, China, and the Mariana Islands. McNamara established a statistical control unit for the XX Bomber Command and devised schedules for B-29s doubling as transports for carrying fuel and cargo over the Hump. He left active duty in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and with a Legion of Merit.

==Ford Motor Company==

In 1946, Tex Thornton, a colonel under whom McNamara had served, put together a group of former officers from the Office of Statistical Control to go into business together. Thornton had seen an article in &quot;Life&quot; magazine portraying the Ford Motor Company as being in dire need of reform. Henry Ford II, himself a World War II veteran from the Navy, hired the entire group of ten, including McNamara.

They helped the money-losing company reform its chaotic administration through modern planning, organization, and management control systems. Because of their youth, combined with asking many questions, Ford employees initially and disparagingly referred to them as the &quot;Quiz Kids&quot;. The Quiz Kids rebranded themselves as the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;.

Starting as manager of planning and financial analysis, McNamara advanced rapidly through a series of top-level management positions. McNamara had Ford adopt computers to construct models to find the most efficient, rational means of production, which led to much rationalization. McNamara&#x27;s style of &quot;scientific management&quot; with his use of spreadsheets featuring graphs showing trends in the auto industry were regarded as extremely innovative in the 1950s and were much copied by other executives in the following decades. In his 1995 memoirs, McNamara wrote: &quot;I had spent fifteen years as a manager [at Ford] identifying problems and forcing organizations—often against their will—to think deeply and realistically about alternative courses of action and their consequences&quot;. He was a force behind the Ford Falcon sedan, introduced in the fall of 1959—a small, simple and inexpensive-to-produce counter to the large, expensive vehicles prominent in the late 1950s. McNamara placed a high emphasis on safety: the &quot;Lifeguard&quot; options package introduced the seat belt (a novelty at the time), padded visor, and dished steering wheel, which helped to prevent the driver from being impaled on the steering column during a collision.

After the Lincoln line&#x27;s very large 1958, 1959, and 1960 models proved unpopular, McNamara pushed for smaller versions, such as the 1961 Lincoln Continental.

On November 9, 1960, McNamara became the first president of the Ford Motor Company from outside the Ford family since John S. Gray in 1906.

==Secretary of Defense==
After his election in 1960, President-elect John F. Kennedy first offered the post of Secretary of Defense to Robert A. Lovett, who had already served in that position in the Truman administration; Lovett declined but recommended McNamara. Kennedy had read about McNamara and his career in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article on December 2, 1960, and interviewed him on December 8, with his brother and right-hand man Robert F. Kennedy also being present. McNamara told Kennedy that he didn&#x27;t know anything about government, to which Kennedy replied: &quot;We can learn our jobs together. I don&#x27;t know how to be president either&quot;. McNamara had read Kennedy&#x27;s ghostwritten book &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; and asked him if he had really written it himself, with Kennedy insisting that he did. McNamara&#x27;s confidence and self-assurance impressed Kennedy. Kennedy offered McNamara the chance to be either Secretary of Defense or Secretary of the Treasury; McNamara came back a week later, accepting the post of Secretary of Defense on the condition of having the right of final approval in all appointments to the Department of Defense, with Kennedy replying: &quot;It&#x27;s a deal&quot;. McNamara&#x27;s salary as the CEO of Ford was $3 million per year while by contrast the position of the Defense Secretary paid only $25,000 per year. Given the financial sacrifices, McNamara was able to insist to Kennedy that he have the right to appoint his officials and run the Pentagon his own way.

According to Special Counsel Ted Sorensen, Kennedy regarded McNamara as the &quot;star of his team, calling upon him for advice on a wide range of issues beyond national security, including business and economic matters.&quot; McNamara became one of the few members of the Kennedy Administration to work and socialize with Kennedy, and he became close to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, eventually serving as a pallbearer at the younger Kennedy&#x27;s funeral in 1968.
Initially, the basic policies outlined by President Kennedy in a message to Congress on March 28, 1961, guided McNamara in the reorientation of the defense program. Kennedy rejected the concept of first-strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the United States and its allies. U.S. arms, he maintained, must constantly be under civilian command and control, and the nation&#x27;s defense posture had to be &quot;designed to reduce the danger of irrational or unpremeditated general war.&quot; The primary mission of U.S. overseas forces, in cooperation with its allies, was &quot;to prevent the steady erosion of the Free World through limited wars&quot;. Kennedy and McNamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response. The U.S. wanted choices in an emergency other than &quot;inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation&quot;, as the president put it. Out of a major review of the military challenges confronting the U.S. initiated by McNamara in 1961 came a decision to increase the nation&#x27;s &quot;limited warfare&quot; capabilities. These moves were significant because McNamara was abandoning President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s policy of massive retaliation in favor of a flexible response strategy that relied on increased U.S. capacity to conduct limited, non-nuclear warfare.

The Kennedy administration placed particular emphasis on improving the ability to counter communist &quot;wars of national liberation&quot;, in which the enemy avoided head-on military confrontation and resorted to political subversion and guerrilla tactics. As McNamara said in his 1962 annual report, &quot;The military tactics are those of the sniper, the ambush, and the raid. The political tactics are terror, extortion, and assassination.&quot; In practical terms, this meant training and equipping U.S. military personnel as well as allies, such as South Vietnam, for those same exact kinds of counterinsurgency operations.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, McNamara served as a member of EXCOMM and played a large role in the Administration&#x27;s handling and eventual defusing of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a strong proponent of the blockade option over a missile strike and helped persuade the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with the blockade option.

Increased attention to conventional strength complemented these special forces preparations. In this instance, he called up reserves and also proceeded to expand the regular armed forces. Whereas active duty strength had declined from approximately 3,555,000 to 2,483,000 between 1953 (the end of the Korean War) and 1961, it increased to nearly 2,808,000 by June 30, 1962. Then the forces leveled off at around 2,700,000 until the Vietnam military buildup began in 1965, reaching a peak of nearly 3,550,000 by mid-1968, just after McNamara left office. Kennedy, who was fascinated with counterinsurgency warfare, made a major push to develop the Special Forces, popularly known as the Green Berets. The U.S. Army leadership was, for the most part, strongly opposed to the counterinsurgency vogue, and stoutly resisted the presidential pressure for more counterinsurgency training and forces. The U.S. Army, for reasons of bureaucratic politics, budgetary reasons and sheer pride, wanted to be equipped to fight a conventional war in central Europe against the Soviet Army, with a large number of divisions armed with expensive hi-tech weapons designed for maximum firepower, instead of having small teams of Special Forces armed with relatively low tech weapons like assault rifles fight in a Third World country.

===Nuclear strategy and triad doctrine===
When McNamara took over the Pentagon in 1961, the United States military relied on an all-out nuclear strike to respond to a Soviet attack of any kind, which would kill Soviet military forces and civilians. This was the same nuclear strategy planned by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), led by General Curtis LeMay. McNamara did not agree with this approach. He sought other options after seeing that this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all Soviet nuclear weapons, thus leaving the United States vulnerable to retaliation. He educated NATO members on the Cold War doctrine of deterrence. McNamara&#x27;s alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the United States nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces. This would prevent retaliation and escalation by holding Soviet cities hostage to a follow-up strike. McNamara later concluded that counterforce was not likely to control escalation but to provoke retaliation. The U.S. nuclear policy remained the same.

====Heightened alert====
McNamara raised the proportion of Strategic Air Command (SAC) strategic bombers on 15-minute ground alert from 25% to 50%, thus lessening their vulnerability to missile attack. He also approved Operation Chrome Dome in 1961, in which some B-52 strategic bomber aircraft armed with thermonuclear weapons remained on continuous airborne alert, flying routes that put them in positions to attack targets in the Soviet Union if they were ordered to do so. This would lead to a number of Broken Arrow nuclear weapon accidents.

====Command and control====
McNamara was concerned that unauthorized use of nuclear weapons was possible. He advocated the development of what became known as Permissive Action Links (PALs), devices incorporated into nuclear weapons that would render them inoperable during an unauthorized attempted use. The PALs were first installed on weapons stored in Europe, and then throughout the U.S. inventory. 

====ABM====

Toward the end of his term McNamara also opposed an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system proposed for installation in the U.S. in defense against Soviet missiles, arguing the $40 billion &quot;in itself is not the problem; the penetrability of the proposed shield is the problem.&quot; Under pressure to proceed with the ABM program after it became clear that the Soviets had begun a similar project, McNamara finally agreed to a &quot;light&quot; system which he believed could protect against the far smaller number of Chinese missiles. However, he never believed it was wise for the United States to move in that direction because of psychological risks of relying too much on nuclear weaponry and that there would be pressure from many directions to build a larger system than would be militarily effective.

McNamara always believed that the best defense strategy for the U.S. was a parity of mutual assured destruction with the Soviet Union. An ABM system would be an ineffective weapon as compared to an increase in deployed nuclear missile capacity.

===Chemical and biological warfare experiments===
Project 112, a biological and chemical weapon experimentation project, was authorized by Robert McNamara as part of a total review of the US military. The name &quot;Project 112&quot; refers to this project&#x27;s number in the 150 project review process authorized by McNamara. Funding and staff were contributed by every branch of the U.S. armed services and intelligence agencies. Project 112 primarily concerned the use of aerosols to disseminate biological and chemical agents that could produce &quot;controlled temporary incapacitation&quot;. The test program was conducted on a large scale at &quot;extracontinental test sites&quot; in the Central and South Pacific with some exposure to military personnel, and secretly in civilian locations such as the New York subway with bacteria deemed &#x27;harmless&#x27; but without consent.

===Other steps===
====Reorganizations====
McNamara took other steps to increase U.S. deterrence posture and military capabilities. In December 1961, he established the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). Authorized to draw forces when needed from the Strategic Army Corps (STRAC), the Tactical Air Command, and the airlift units of the Military Air Transport Service and the military services, Strike Command had the mission &quot;to respond swiftly and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace in any part of the world, reinforcing unified commands or... carrying out separate contingency operations.&quot; McNamara also increased long-range airlift and sealift capabilities and funds for space research and development. After reviewing the separate and often uncoordinated service efforts in intelligence and communications, McNamara in 1961 consolidated these functions in the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Communications Agency (the latter originally established by SoD Thomas S. Gates Jr. in 1960), having both report to the Secretary of Defense through the JCS. The end effect was to remove the Intelligence function from the control of the military and to put it under the control of the Secretary of Defense. In the same year, he set up the Defense Supply Agency to work toward unified supply procurement, distribution, and inventory management under the control of the Secretary of Defense rather than the uniformed military.

====Systems analysis====
McNamara&#x27;s institution of systems analysis as a basis for making key decisions on force requirements, weapon systems, and other matters occasioned much debate. Two of its main practitioners during the McNamara era, Alain C. Enthoven and K. Wayne Smith, described the concept as follows: &quot;First, the word &#x27;systems&#x27; indicates that every decision should be considered in as broad a context as necessary... The word &#x27;analysis&#x27; emphasizes the need to reduce a complex problem to its component parts for better understanding. Systems analysis takes a complex problem and sorts out the tangle of significant factors so that each can be studied by the method most appropriate to it.&quot; Enthoven and Smith said they used mainly civilians as systems analysts because they could apply independent points of view to force planning. McNamara&#x27;s tendency to take military advice into less account than had previous secretaries and to override military opinions contributed to his unpopularity with service leaders. It was also generally thought that Systems Analysis, rather than being objective, was tailored by the civilians to support decisions that McNamara had already made.

The most notable example of systems analysis was the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) instituted by United States Department of Defense Comptroller Charles J. Hitch. McNamara directed Hitch to analyze defense requirements systematically and produce a long-term, program-oriented defense budget. PPBS evolved to become the heart of the McNamara management program. According to Enthoven and Smith, the basic ideas of PPBS were: &quot;the attempt to put defense program issues into a broader context and to search for explicit measures of national need and adequacy&quot;; &quot;consideration of military needs and costs together&quot;; &quot;explicit consideration of alternatives at the top decision level&quot;; &quot;the active use of an analytical staff at the top policymaking levels&quot;; &quot;a plan combining both forces and costs which projected into the future the foreseeable implications of current decisions&quot;; and &quot;open and explicit analysis, that is, each analysis should be made available to all interested parties, so that they can examine the calculations, data, and assumptions and retrace the steps leading to the conclusions.&quot; In practice, the data produced by the analysis was so large and so complex that while it was available to all interested parties, none of them could challenge the conclusions.

Among the management tools developed to implement PPBS were the Five Year Defense Plan (FYDP), the Draft Presidential Memorandum (DPM), the Readiness, Information and Control Tables, and the Development Concept Paper (DCP). The annual FYDP was a series of tables projecting forces for eight years and costs and manpower for five years in mission-oriented, rather than individual service, programs. By 1968, the FYDP covered ten military areas: strategic forces, general-purpose forces, intelligence and communications, airlift and sealift, guard and reserve forces, research and development, central supply and maintenance, training and medical services, administration and related activities, and support of other nations.
The Draft Presidential Memorandum (DPM)—intended for the White House and usually prepared by the systems analysis office—was a method to study and analyze major defense issues. Sixteen DPMs appeared between 1961 and 1968 on such topics as strategic offensive and defensive forces, NATO strategy and force structure, military assistance, and tactical air forces. OSD sent the DPMs to the services and the Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) for comment; in making decisions, McNamara included in the DPM a statement of alternative approaches, force levels, and other factors. The DPM in its final form became a decision document. The DPM was hated by the JCS and uniformed military in that it cut their ability to communicate directly to the White House. The DPMs were also disliked because the systems analysis process was so heavyweight that it was impossible for any service to effectively challenge its conclusions.

The Development Concept Paper examined performance, schedule, cost estimates, and technical risks to provide a basis for determining whether to begin or continue a research and development program. But in practice, what it proved to be was a cost burden that became a barrier to entry for companies attempting to deal with the military. It aided the trend toward a few large non-competitive defense contractors serving the military. Rather than serving any useful purpose, the overhead necessary to generate information that was often in practice ignored resulted in increased costs throughout the system.

The Readiness, Information, and Control Tables provided data on specific projects, more detailed than in the FYDP, such as the tables for the Southeast Asia Deployment Plan, which recorded by month and quarter the schedule for deployment, consumption rates, and future projections of U.S. forces in Southeast Asia.

====Cost reductions====
McNamara&#x27;s staff stressed systems analysis as an aid in decision-making on weapon development and many other budget issues. The secretary believed that the United States could afford any amount needed for national security, but that &quot;this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency to the way we spend our defense dollars... You have to make a judgment on how much is enough.&quot; Acting on these principles, McNamara instituted a much-publicized cost reduction program, which, he reported, saved $14 billion in the five-year period beginning in 1961. Although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts, he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary for national security. He was equally determined about other cost-saving measures.

Due to the nuclear arms race, the Vietnam War buildup and other projects, Total Obligational Authority (TOA) increased greatly during the McNamara years. Fiscal year TOA increased from $48.4 billion in 1962 (equal to $ billion in ) to $49.5 ($) billion in 1965 (before the major Vietnam increases) to $74.9 ($) billion in 1968, McNamara&#x27;s last year in office (though he left office in February). Not until FY 1984 did DoD&#x27;s total obligational authority surpass that of FY 1968 in constant dollars.

====Program consolidation====
McNamara&#x27;s actions in mandating a premature across-the-board adoption of the untested M16 rifle proved catastrophic when the weapons began to fail in combat, though later congressional investigations revealed the causes of these failures as negligence and borderline sabotage on behalf of the Army ordnance corps&#x27; officers. 

One major hallmark of McNamara&#x27;s cost reductions was the consolidation of programs from different services, most visibly in aircraft acquisition, believing that the redundancy created waste and unnecessary spending. 

McNamara directed the Air Force to adopt the Navy&#x27;s McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and LTV A-7 Corsair II combat aircraft, consolidations that were quite successful, and the success was bidirectional: the Navy would later adopt improvements first made by the Air Force.

McNamara tried to extend his success by merging development programs as well, resulting in the TFX, later known as the F-111 dual service project to combine Navy requirements for a Fleet Air Defense (FAD) aircraft and Air Force requirements for a tactical bomber. His experience in the corporate world led him to believe that adopting a single type for different missions and service would save money. He insisted on the General Dynamics entry over the DOD&#x27;s preference for Boeing because of commonality issues. Though heralded as a fighter that could do everything (fast supersonic dash, slow carrier and short airfield landings, tactical strike and even close air support), in the end it involved too many compromises to succeed at any of them. The Navy version was drastically overweight and difficult to land, and eventually canceled after a Grumman study showed it was incapable of matching the abilities of the newly revealed Soviet MiG-23 and MiG-25 aircraft. The F-111 eventually found its niche as a tactical bomber and electronic warfare aircraft with the Air Force.

However, many analysts believe that even though the TFX project itself was a failure, McNamara was ahead of his time as the trend in fighter design has continued toward consolidation—the F-16 Falcon and F/A-18 Hornet emerged as multi-role fighters, and most modern designs combine many of the roles the TFX would have had. In many ways, the Joint Strike Fighter is seen as a rebirth of the TFX project, according to defense analyst David S. Grantham, in that it purports to satisfy the needs of three American air arms (as well as several foreign customers), fulfilling the roles of strike fighter, carrier-launched fighter, V/STOL, and close air support (and drawing many criticisms similar to those leveled against the TFX).

===Cuban Missile Crisis===
The Cuban Missile Crisis was a nuclear standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union and lasted for 13 days in October 1962. During this time, Robert McNamara was serving as Secretary of Defense and one of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s trusted advisors. When Kennedy received confirmation of the placement of offensive Soviet missiles in Cuba, he immediately set up the &#x27;Executive Committee&#x27;, referred to as &#x27;ExComm&#x27;. This committee included United States government officials, such as Robert McNamara, advising Kennedy on the crisis. Kennedy instructed ExComm to immediately come up with a response to the Soviet threat unanimously without him present.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff favored launching air strikes against the Soviet missile sites in Cuba, an opinion that McNamara did not hold. He advised Kennedy against the chiefs, warning that air strikes would almost certainly be metaphorically crossing the Rubicon. McNamara&#x27;s relations with the hawkish Joint Chiefs of Staff had been strained during the crisis, and his relations with Admiral George Anderson and General Curtis LeMay were especially testy. Both Anderson and LeMay had favored invading Cuba, welcoming the prospects of a war with the Soviet Union, under the grounds that a war with them was already inevitable, and whose attitudes towards Kennedy and McNamara had verged on insubordination. Anderson had at a one-point ordered McNamara out of the Naval Operations Room, saying that as a civilian he was unqualified to be making decisions about naval matters, leading McNamara to say that he was the Defense Secretary and Anderson was unqualified to be ordering him to do anything.  

On Tuesday October 16, ExComm had their first meeting. The majority of officials favored an air attack on Cuba in hopes to destroy the missile sites, although the vote was not unanimous which brought them to other alternatives. By the end of the week, ExComm came up with four different alternative strategies to present to the president: a blockade, an air strike, an invasion, or some combination of these. These actions are known as OPLAN 312, OPLAN 314 and OPLAN 316. A quarantine was a way to prevent the Soviets from bringing any military equipment in or out of Cuba. During the final review of both alternatives on Sunday, October 21, upon Kennedy&#x27;s request, McNamara presented the argument against the attack and for the quarantine. On Wednesday, October 24 at 10:00 am EDT, the quarantine line around Cuba went into effect.

With tensions continuing to escalate, it was confirmed the crisis had to be resolved within 48 hours when the White House received two messages from Nikita Khrushchev. The first message, an informal one, stated if the United States guaranteed to not invade Cuba then they would take the missiles out. The second message, a more formal one, was broadcast on the radio stating if the United States attacked then Cuba was prepared to retaliate with masses of military power. Although American defense planning focused on using nuclear weapons, Kennedy and McNamara saw it was clear the use of strategic weapons could be suicidal. Following Cuba&#x27;s aftermath, McNamara stated, &quot;There is no such thing as strategy, only crisis management.&quot;

After the crisis, McNamara recommended to Kennedy that Admiral Anderson and General LeMay be sacked. However, Kennedy was afraid of a Congressional backlash if he sacked two of the chiefs at once. Moreover, Kennedy did not wish for his disagreements with the Joint Chiefs to become public and felt that sacking two of the chiefs at once would lead to speculation in the media about such a disagreement. Kennedy told McNamara: &quot;All right, you can fire one. Which one will it be?&quot; Without hesitation, McNamara answered &quot;Anderson&quot;. Later on in 1963, a White House release announced that Admiral Anderson was the new American ambassador to Portugal.

===Vietnam War===

====Background====
The Truman and Eisenhower administrations had committed the U.S. to support the French and native anti-Communist forces in Vietnam in resisting efforts by the Communists in the North to unify the country. Aid was initially limited to financial support, military advice and covert intelligence gathering but expanded after 1954 when the French withdrew. The US Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) Vietnam was established on 1 November 1955. In December 1956 the North Vietnam government authorized Viet Cong forces in South Vietnam to begin a low-level insurgency. The first battle between the Viet Cong and the South Vietnamese army occurred on 26 September 1959.

During President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s term, while McNamara was Secretary of Defense, American troops in South Vietnam increased from 900 to 16,000 advisers. They were not supposed to engage in combat but rather to train the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN).

The Gulf of Tonkin incidents in August 1964, which involved two purported attacks on U.S. Navy destroyers by North Vietnamese naval vessels, led to an escalated of U.S. involvement in Vietnam.

Under the Kennedy administration, McNamara was closely aligned with Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State, with both favoring greater American support for South Vietnam.

====Laos====

Initially, the main concern of the new Kennedy administration was Laos, not South Vietnam. In February 1961, McNamara spoke in favor of intervention in Laos, saying that six AT-6 planes owned by the Central Intelligence Agency could be fitted to carry 200-pound bombs in support of General Phoumi Nosavan&#x27;s forces. Rusk shot down that proposal, saying his World War II experiences in Burma had taught him that bombing was ineffective in the jungles and six planes were not enough. In the spring of 1961 Kennedy seriously considered intervening in Laos where the Communist Pathet Lao, supported by North Vietnam, were winning the civil war. At one point, the Joint Chiefs of Staff advised sending 60,000 U.S. troops into Laos. However, Laos appeared to be an undeveloped, landlocked country with barely any modern roads and only two modern airfields which were both small by Western standards and would have caused logistical problems. Furthermore, memories of the Korean War were still fresh, and it was generally accepted if the United States sent in troops into Laos, it was almost certain to provoke Chinese intervention and lead to another confrontation with the country. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) was split with its European members such as France and Britain in opposition to the intervention and its Asian members such as Thailand and the Philippines in support. McNamara noted to Kennedy it was quite possible that the two airfields in Laos could be seized by the Communist forces, which would cut off any U.S. forces in Laos and turn the intervention into a debacle. At a meeting on 29 April 1961, when questioned by the Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, McNamara stated that &quot;we should take a stand in Thailand and South Vietnam&quot;, pointedly omitting Laos from the nations in Southeast Asia to risk a war over.

McNamara soon changed his mind about Laos. On 1 May 1961, he advised Kennedy to send in ground troops into Laos, saying &quot;we must be prepared to win&quot;, and advising using nuclear weapons if China should intervene. On 2 May, McNamara, using more strong language, told Kennedy that the United States should definitely intervene in Laos, even though he was very certain that it would lead to Chinese intervention, concluding that &quot;at some point, we may have to initiate the use of nuclear weapons to prevent the defeat of our forces&quot;. Kennedy, who was distrustful of the hawkish advice given by the Joint Chiefs of Staff after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion, instead decided to seek a diplomatic solution to the Laos crisis at a peace conference in Geneva in 1961–62 that ultimately led to an agreement to make Laos officially neutral in the Cold War. The problems posed by the possibility of a war with China and the logistical problems of supporting a large units of troops in Laos led McNamara ultimately to favor an alternative strategy of stationing a small number of U.S. Army Special Forces in Laos to work with American allies such as the Hmong hill tribes. On 29 September 1961, the Joint Chiefs of Staff estimated to McNamara that if Chinese forces entered Laos, then SEATO forces would need at least 15 divisions consisting of some 278, 000 men to stop them. At the same time, the Joint Chiefs also estimated that the two airfields in Laos were capable of landing some 1,000 troops a day each, which would give the advantage to the Chinese. Such dire assessments led Kennedy to ignore McNamara and the Joint Chiefs, and to favor a diplomatic solution to the Laos crisis.

Though McNamara had supported plans to intervene in Laos in 1961, by 1962 he had changed his mind. During a discussion with General Lyman Lemnitzer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, McNamara had asked them what the United States would do with a hypothetical North Vietnamese intervention in the event of an American intervention into Laos, but none of them could provide an answer. The inability of the Joint Chiefs to answer McNamara&#x27;s questions about what the United States should do if North Vietnam should stage a major offensive down the Mekong river valley from Laos into Cambodia and finally South Vietnam persuaded McNamara that the Joint Chiefs had no vision of the issues and were merely advocating intervention in Laos to avoid looking weak.

====First Vietnam proposals and 1962 fact finding mission====

In October 1961, when General Maxwell Taylor and State Department Counselor Walt Whitman Rostow advised sending 8,000 American combat troops to South Vietnam, McNamara rejected that recommendation as inadequate, stating that 8,000 troops would &quot;probably not tip the scales decisively&quot;, instead recommending to Kennedy that he send six divisions to South Vietnam. Kennedy rejected that advice. 

In May 1962, McNamara paid his first visit to South Vietnam, where he told the press &quot;every quantitative measurement...shows that we are winning the war&quot;. Led by General Paul D. Harkins, the officers of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) altered a map that showed too much of South Vietnam under Viet Cong (VC) control, and massaged the statistics to make the VC appear weaker than they were. McNamara&#x27;s &quot;quantitative&quot; style based upon much number-crunching by computers about trends in Vietnam missed the human dimension. Aspects of the war such as popular views and attitudes in South Vietnam, and South Vietnamese president Ngô Đình Diệm&#x27;s &quot;divide and rule&quot; strategy of having multiple government departments compete against one another as a way of staying in power were missed by McNamara&#x27;s &quot;quantitative&quot; approach as there was no way that computers could calculate these aspects of the war.

In 1962, McNamara supported a plan for mass spraying of the rice fields with herbicides in the Phu Yen mountains to starve the VC out, but this was stopped when Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs W. Averell Harriman pointed out to Kennedy that the ensuing famine would kill thousands of innocent people. In late 1962, McNamara ordered planners to assume the withdraw of American advisers from South Vietnam in 1964 as, according to Pentagon calculations, the war should be won by then. At the time, McNamara told Kennedy: &quot;There is a new feeling of confidence that victory is possible&quot;.

====Battle of Ap Bac====

On 2 January 1963, McNamara&#x27;s rosy projections and assumptions based upon what his computers had told him about Vietnam were shattered by the Battle of Ap Bac when three VC companies were encircled by the ARVN&#x27;s 7th Division in the village of Ap Bac. Despite being outnumbered by a ratio of 10–1 and being heavily outgunned, the VC defeated the 7th Division in the ensuing battle and escaped into the jungle. Colonel John Paul Vann, the American adviser attached to the 7th Division summed up the battle in a report in his usual earthy language as: &quot;A miserable fucking performance, just like what it always is&quot;. Vann, a colorful figure whose outspokenly blunt criticism of how the war was being fought made him a favorite of the media, was much disliked by McNamara, who did not appreciate the criticism as he continued to insist that the war was being won.

Vann&#x27;s reports criticizing Diệm&#x27;s regime as corrupt and incompetent were most unwelcome to McNamara who contended that the reforms advocated by Vann were unnecessary. In March 1963, Vann resigned from the Army.

====The Buddhist crisis====
After the Battle of Ap Bac, a debate began in the Kennedy cabinet about the viability of the Diệm regime, which was reinforced by the Buddhist crisis, which began in May 1963. When talk of supporting a coup against Diệm was first raised by Kennedy at a National Security Council meeting in August 1963, McNamara spoke in favor of retaining Diệm. On 31 August 1963, Paul Kattenburg, a newly returned diplomat from Saigon suggested at a meeting attend by Rusk, McNamara and Vice President Johnson that the United States should end support for Diệm and leave South Vietnam to its fate. McNamara was stoutly opposed to Kattenburg&#x27;s suggestion, saying &quot;we have been winning the war&quot;.

====First 1963 fact-finding mission====

Unable to gain a consensus about what to do, in September 1963, Kennedy sent McNamara and General Taylor on a &quot;fact-finding mission&quot; to South Vietnam. At a meeting in the Gia Long Palace, President Diệm showed McNamara various graphs and charts that purported to be proof that the war was being won. This performance convinced McNamara the war was as good as won. Kennedy wanted a negative assessment of Diệm to justify supporting a coup, but McNamara and Taylor instead wrote about the &quot;great progress&quot; achieved by Diệm and confidently predicted that the &quot;bulk&quot; of the American advisers would leave in 1965 as by that point they predicted that the VC insurgency would be crushed. McNamara predicted that if Diệm continued his policies, that by 1965 the insurgency would be &quot;little more than organized banditry&quot;. With the CIA and the ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. urging support for a coup while the Pentagon was opposed, Kennedy vacillated but ultimately gave the power of decision to Lodge. Lodge, who detested Diệm, gave his approval to the generals plotting against him.

====Coups and second 1963 fact-finding mission====

On 1 November 1963, the coup was launched. After the presidential palace was overrun in the fighting, Diệm was captured trying to flee Saigon and executed on 2 November 1963. The new government in Saigon was headed by General Dương Văn Minh. On 22 November 1963, Kennedy was assassinated and succeeded by Lyndon Johnson. 

In December 1963, Johnson sent McNamara on another &quot;fact-finding mission&quot; to South Vietnam to assess Minh&#x27;s performance. On 19 December 1963, McNamara reported the situation was &quot;very disturbing&quot; as the &quot;current trends, unless reversed in the next two or three months, will lead to neutralization at best or more likely to a Communist-controlled state&quot;. He also admitted that the computer models and statistics to which he had attached great importance were &quot;grossly in error&quot; and that government control of rural areas had &quot;in fact been deteriorating...to a far greater extent than we realized&quot; since July. Regarding Minh&#x27;s regime McNamara wrote at present &quot;there is no organized government in South Vietnam&quot;. Though McNamara admitted that the new regime was &quot;indecisive and drifting&quot;, he advised Johnson to undertake &quot;more forceful moves if the situation does not show early signs of improvement&quot;.
On 30 January 1964, Minh was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état by General Nguyễn Khánh but the change in leadership did not affect the war. Lyman Kirkpatrick of the CIA reported in February 1964 after visiting Saigon that he was &quot;shocked by the number of our people and of the military, even those whose job is always to say we are winning, who feel the tide is against us&quot;. In a battle that same month which underscored problems in the ARVN, a VC battalion in the Mekong Delta escaped from a larger force of South Vietnamese troops which had been rated as some of the very best in the ARVN by the American advisers who had trained them.

====1964 fact-finding mission====
On 8 March 1964, McNamara visited South Vietnam to report to President Johnson about how well the new regime of Khánh was handling the war. Upon landing in Saigon, McNamara told the press: &quot;We shall stay for as long it takes to ...win the battle against the Communist insurgents&quot;. During his visit, McNamara spoke memorized phrases in mangled Vietnamese (McNamara kept forgetting that Vietnamese is a tonal language) in speeches praising Khánh as South Vietnam&#x27;s &quot;best possible leader&quot;. McNamara always ended his speeches by shouting out what he thought was a phrase meaning &quot;Long live a free Vietnam!&quot;, but as he used the wrong tones, instead he said &quot;Vietnam, go to sleep!&quot; McNamara pressed Khánh to put South Vietnam on a war footing by conscripting all able-bodied young men into the military, which he promised he would do. However, Khánh did not keep his promise as wealthy and middle class South Vietnamese families objected to having their sons conscripted. As a result, the burden of conscription fell onto the sons of poor families, provoking much resentment. 

After returning to Washington on 13 March, McNamara reported to Johnson that the situation had &quot;unquestionably been growing worse&quot;: since his last visit in December 1963 with 40% of the countryside now under &quot;Vietcong control or predominant influence&quot;, most of the South Vietnamese people were displaying &quot;apathy and indifference&quot;, the desertion rate in the ARVN was &quot;high and increasing&quot; while the VC were &quot;recruiting energetically&quot;. The &quot;greatest weakness&quot; accordingly to McNamara was the &quot;uncertain viability&quot; of Khánh&#x27;s government, which could have been overthrown at any moment as the ARVN was ridden with factionalism.

To save South Vietnam, McNamara recommended that the United States make it &quot;emphatically clear&quot; its willingness to support Khánh to the hilt. Other recommendations, which were accepted in a National Security Council &quot;action memorandum&quot;, called for the United States to pay for an increase in the ARVN, provide the Republic of Vietnam Air Force with more planes and helicopters, and for the United States to pay for more civil servants to administer rural South Vietnam. More importantly, the &quot;action memorandum&quot; redefined the Vietnam War as not only important for Asia, but for the entire world as the document asserted the global credibility of the United States was now at stake as it was claimed America&#x27;s allies would lose faith in American promises if the South Vietnamese government were overthrown. The &quot;action memorandum&quot; argued that to &quot;lose&quot; South Vietnam would fatally weaken American global leadership, making the war a &quot;test case&quot; of American willingness to continue as a global power.

In April 1964, Senator Wayne Morse called the war &quot;McNamara&#x27;s War&quot;. In response, McNamara told the press that he was honored, saying &quot;I think it is a very important war, and I am pleased to be identified with it and do whatever I can to win it&quot;. In May 1964, Senator Richard Russell advised Johnson against relying too much on McNamara, saying &quot;McNamara is the smartest fella any of us know. But he&#x27;s got too much-he&#x27;s opinionated as hell-and he&#x27;s made up his mind&quot;. Russell told Johnson that he should find an expert, preferably a World War II general who was &quot;not scared to death of McNamara&quot; to go to South Vietnam to say that the war was unwinnable and that the United States should pull out, but Johnson rejected the advice.

Although South Vietnam by 1964 was receiving a sum of American economic and military aid that ran to $2 million per day, the South Vietnamese state was falling apart. Corruption reached such a point that most South Vietnamese civil servants and soldiers were not being paid while the projects for &quot;rural pacification&quot; that the United States had paid for had collapsed as the money had instead been stolen. The advice that McNamara and other American officials gave to the South Vietnamese to make reforms to crack down on corruption and make the government more effective was always ignored as by this point the South Vietnamese government knew very well that the Americans, having repeatedly promised in public that they would never permit the &quot;loss&quot; of South Vietnam, were now prisoners of their own rhetoric. The threats to withhold aid were bluffs, which the South Vietnamese exposed by simply ignoring the American advice, leading to a situation whereby Stanley Karnow, the Vietnam correspondent for &quot;Time&quot; noted:&quot;...America lacked leverage...For the South Vietnamese knew that the United States could not abandon them without damaging its own prestige. So despite their reliance on American aid, now more than a half-billion dollars a year, they could safely defy American dictates. In short, their weakness was their strength&quot;. One South Vietnamese minister told Karnow at the time: &quot;Our big advantage over the Americans is that they want to win the war more than we do&quot;. 

To compensate for the weaknesses of the South Vietnamese state, by late winter of 1964, senior officials in the Johnson administration such as McNamara&#x27;s deputy, William Bundy, the assistant secretary of defense, were advocating American intervention in the war. Such intervention presented a constitutional problem: to intervene on the scale envisioned would mean waging war, and only Congress had the legal power to declare war. The solution was floated for Congress to pass a resolution granting Johnson the power to wage war in Vietnam in spite of his opposition to mooted plans to declare war on North Vietnam.

====Gulf of Tonkin incident====

By 1964, the U.S. Navy sent destroyers into the Gulf of Tonkin to support raids by South Vietnamese commandos on North Vietnam and to gather intelligence. On 2 August 1964, one destroyer, the was allegedly involved in a naval skirmish with North Vietnamese Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy torpedo boats. On 4 August 1964, the &quot;Maddox&quot; and another destroyer, the , initially reported they were attacked by the North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters on a stormy night, but shortly afterward reported there was probably no attack. Captain John J. Herrick of the &quot;Maddox&quot; reported that the &quot;torpedo boats&quot; were almost certainly just radar &quot;blips&quot; caused by the &quot;freak weather effects&quot; of the storm and the reports of an attack on his ship were due to an &quot;overeager&quot; radar operator who mistook the motors of the ship for the rush of torpedoes. Johnson promptly seized upon the reports of an attack on a Navy warship in international waters to ask Congress to pass a resolution giving him the authority to wage war in Vietnam. McNamara, via Admiral U. S. Grant Sharp Jr. of the Pacific fleet, put strong pressure on Herrick to say that his ship had been attacked by torpedo boats, despite Herrick&#x27;s reservations. 

On 5 August 1964, McNamara appeared before Congress to present proof of what he claimed was an attack on the Navy&#x27;s warships in international waters off the Gulf of Tonkin and stated it was imperative that Congress pass the resolution as quickly as possible. Records from the Lyndon Johnson Library show McNamara may have misled Johnson on the purported attack on the Maddox by allegedly withholding recommendations from US Pacific Commanders against executing airstrikes. McNamara was also instrumental in presenting the event to Congress and the public as justification for escalation of the war against the communists. 

Decades later after the fact in 1995, McNamara met with former North Vietnam Defense Minister , who told his American counterpart that the August 4 attack never happened, a conclusion McNamara eventually came to accept.

Congress approved the resolution on August 10, 1964, with only Senators Wayne Morse (D-OR), and Ernest Gruening (D-AK), voting against, Concurrent with his efforts to pass the resolution, President Johnson had ordered Operation Pierce Arrow, retaliatory air strikes on North Vietnamese naval bases. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution authorized the president &quot;to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the U.S. and to prevent further aggression&quot; but the larger issue turned out to be the sweeping powers granted by the resolution. It gave Johnson virtually unfettered authority to expand retaliation for a relatively minor naval incident into a major land war involving 500,000 American soldiers. &quot;The fundamental issue of Tonkin Gulf involved not deception but, rather, misuse of power bestowed by the resolution,&quot; McNamara wrote later. Though Johnson now had the authority to wage war, he proved reluctant to use it, for example by rejecting the advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to bomb North Vietnam after a VC attack on Bien Hoa Air Base killed five Americans and destroyed 5 B-57 bombers.

====Escalation====
Knowing of Johnson&#x27;s hesitance, on 1 December 1964 McNamara recommended a &quot;graduated&quot; response program, urging Johnson to launch Operation Barrel Roll, a bombing offensive against North Vietnamese supply lines along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the southern part of Laos, which was approved by the president. On Christmas Eve 1964, the VC bombed the Brinks Hotel in Saigon, killing two Americans. Despite McNamara&#x27;s recommendations to bomb North Vietnam, Johnson still hesitated.

In 1965, in response to increased military activity in South Vietnam by VC insurgents and North Vietnamese regular forces, the U.S. began bombing North Vietnam, deployed large military forces and entered into combat in South Vietnam. McNamara&#x27;s plan, supported by requests from top U.S. military commanders in Vietnam, led to the commitment of 485,000 troops by the end of 1967 and almost 535,000 by June 30, 1968. In January 1965, McNamara together with the National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy co-wrote a memo to President Johnson stating, &quot;both of us are now pretty well convinced that our present policy can lead only to disastrous defeat&quot; as it was hopeless to expect the unstable and corrupt South Vietnamese government to defeat the VC who were steadily &quot;gaining in the countryside&quot;. Bundy and McNamara wrote &quot;the time for has come for hard choices&quot; as the United States now had the alternatives of either negotiating with North Vietnam to &quot;salvage what little can be preserved&quot; or to resort to intervention to &quot;force a change&quot;. Both Bundy and McNamara stated that they favored the latter, arguing that the commitment of U.S. troops to fight in South Vietnam and a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam were now required. McNamara&#x27;s hawkish stance on Vietnam was well known in Washington and many in the press often referred to the war as &quot;McNamara&#x27;s war&quot; as he was the one in the cabinet always pressing for greater American involvement.
In February 1965, the VC attacked the American airfield at Pleiku, killing 8 Americans and destroying 10 aircraft. After hearing of the attack, Johnson assembled his national security team together with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John W. McCormack, and the Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield, to announce &quot;I&#x27;ve had enough of this&quot;. Only Mansfield and the Vice President, Hubert Humphrey, objected to Johnson&#x27;s plans to bomb North Vietnam. Aircraft from the carrier, , launched Operation Flaming Dart bombing the North Vietnamese army base at Đồng Hới later that day. McNamara was forced to tell Johnson that the Flaming Dart raids had done little damage owing to the heavy clouds, which caused the pilots to miss when dropping their bombs, and more raids would be needed. On 11 February, Johnson ordered more bombing raids, and on 2 March approved Operation Rolling Thunder, a strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam that was originally planned to last eight weeks, but instead went on for three years. After the bombing raids started, MACV commander General William Westmoreland, cabled Johnson to say that Da Nang Air Base was vulnerable as he had no faith in the ability of the South Vietnamese to protect it, leading him to ask for American troops to be deployed instead. On 8 March 1965, two battalions from the United States Marine Corps landed at Danang, making the beginning of the ground war for the United States. On 20 April, McNamara urged Johnson to send 40,000 troops to Vietnam, advice that was accepted.

====1965 fact-finding mission====
By June 1965, Westmoreland reported that South Vietnam was faced with a &quot;collapse&quot;, which would require 280,000 troops to stop and reverse the momentum. McNamara&#x27;s advice in July 1965 to Johnson was to commit more 180,000 troops to South Vietnam in addition to a stepped up aerial offensive to destroy North Vietnam&#x27;s economy was called by Bundy &quot;rash to the point of folly&quot;. Bundy stated that for Johnson to agree to McNamara&#x27;s advice &quot;was a slippery slope toward total U.S. responsibility and corresponding fecklessness on the Vietnamese side&quot;. Bundy argued that it was the responsibility of the South Vietnamese government to stop the VC and that if the Americans continued to do all the fighting, then the United States would lack the necessary leverage to pressure Saigon into making reforms, turning &quot;...the conflict into a white man&#x27;s war, with the United States in the shoes of the French&quot;. 

To resolve the debate, McNamara visited South Vietnam later in July on yet another &quot;fact-finding mission&quot; for Johnson and met the new South Vietnamese Premier, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, who had just overthrown Khánh. Kỳ wore a flamboyant uniform which he had designed himself of a white jacket, black pants, red socks and black shoes which led McNamara to dub him as looking &quot;like a saxophone player in a second-rate nightclub&quot;. McNamara was not impressed with Kỳ, reporting to Johnson that he saw little evidence that he was capable of winning the war, and the United States would have to send more troops to South Vietnam. Upon his return to the United States, McNamara told the press that the U.S. forces in Vietnam were inflicting &quot;increasingly heavy losses&quot; on the VC, but in private told Johnson that the situation was &quot;worse than a year ago&quot;.

====Norman Morrison suicide====

On November 2, 1965, Quaker antiwar activist Norman Morrison died after self-immolation with kerosene under McNamara&#x27;s window at the Pentagon. All McNamara saw from his office was the smoke rising from the parking lot, but he was sufficiently troubled by the incident that he refused to discuss it with his family, all the more so because his wife Margey was opposed to the war and sympathized with Morrison&#x27;s feelings, if not his suicide. McNamara later said in the 2003 documentary &quot;The Fog of War&quot;, &quot;[Morrison] came to the Pentagon, doused himself with gasoline. Burned himself to death below my office ... his wife issued a very moving statement – &#x27;human beings must stop killing other human beings&#x27; – and that&#x27;s a belief that I shared, I shared it then, I believe it even more strongly today&quot;. McNamara then posited, &quot;How much evil must we do in order to do good? We have certain ideals, certain responsibilities. Recognize that at times you will have to engage in evil, but minimize it.&quot;

====Reserve mobilization proposal====
McNamara also advised the president that by early 1966 he would have to send 100,000 more troops to South Vietnam in order to win the war, and he would need to mobilize the Reserves and state National Guards as well. Johnson accepted the first recommendation while rejecting the latter, disregarding Bundy&#x27;s warnings that sending more troops would paradoxically mean holding less leverage over South Vietnam. To mobilize the Reserves and National Guards would mean having to call up hundreds of thousands of men from civilian life, which would inevitably disrupt the economy and put it on a war footing. Johnson rejected the scenario as it would impose too many sacrifices on ordinary Americans while threatening his chances for reelection. Because the Reserves were never called up, the Army had to send much of its manpower to Vietnam, leaving the U.S. divisions in Western Europe in a &quot;skeletal&quot; condition. To make up for the shortfall, the Army had to rely upon the draft, which caused much domestic opposition, especially as the draft system offered generous exemptions for those attending university and college and lead to the burden of the fighting to fall disproportionately upon men from poorer families. Because of the refusal to call up the Reserves, McNamara had to increase the draft call in July 1965 from 17,000 per month to 35,000 per month. As most of the 18 and 19-year-old draftees had a high school diploma or less, this also led to a decline in the Army&#x27;s intellectual standards, with many officers complaining that most of the draftees were not intelligent enough to be trained for technical duties or promoted up the ranks. Throughout the war, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Earle Wheeler, pressed very strongly for the reserves and national guards to be called out, saying the war was steadily ruining the U.S. Army.

====Costs====
Though McNamara warned the president in July 1965 that the war would cost an extra $10 billion in defense spending over the next year, Johnson at a press conference said his administration would be spending only an extra $300–400 million until January 1966. McNamara warned that the increased spending would spark inflation and raise the deficit, advising Johnson to ask Congress to increase taxes to forestall those eventualities. Johnson responded by saying that Congress would not vote for higher taxes, leading McNamara to argue that the president should at least try, saying &quot;I would rather fight for what&#x27;s right and fail than not try&quot;. Johnson snapped: &quot;Goddammit, Bob, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with you-you aren&#x27;t a politician&quot;.

====Body counts====

On 7 November 1965, McNamara sent Johnson a memo saying that the &quot;substantial loss of American lives&quot; in Vietnam was worth the sacrifice in order to contain China, which McNamara called the world&#x27;s most dangerous nation. McNamara wrote that the deployment of troops to South Vietnam would &quot;make sense only if they are in support of a long-term United States policy to contain China&quot;, writing that the process of &quot;containing&quot; China would require &quot;American attention, money and, from time to time unfortunately lives&quot;.

The casualty lists mounted as the number of troops and the intensity of fighting escalated. McNamara put in place a statistics-based strategy for victory in Vietnam. He concluded that there was a limited number of VC fighters in South Vietnam and that a war of attrition would be sufficient to destroy them. He applied metrics (body counts) to determine how close to success his plan was. Faced with a guerrilla war, the question of holding territory was irrelevant as the VC never operated for extended periods in areas where the Americans were strong and if the Americans occupied an area in force, the VC simply moved to other areas where the American presence was weaker. Westmoreland had decided, with the support of McNamara, to defend all of South Vietnam, believing that he could win via a strategy of attrition as he would simply inflict enough losses to end the enemy&#x27;s ability to wage war. McNamara devised the &quot;body count&quot; measurement to determine how well the Americans were doing, reasoning if the Americans were inflicting heavy losses as measured by the &quot;body count&quot;, it must be a sign that they were winning. 

General William Peers wrote critically of the &quot;body count&quot; strategy, stating: &quot;...with improper leadership, &#x27;body count&#x27; could create competition between units, particularly if these statistics were compared like baseball standings and there were no stringent requirements as to how and by whom the counts were to be made&quot;. The obsession with &quot;body counts&quot; led to much exaggeration of the losses inflicted on the enemy as the officers with the highest &quot;body counts&quot; were promoted while also fueling a grisly competition between units to achieve the highest &quot;body counts&quot; that led to innocent civilians being killed to inflate their daily &quot;body counts&quot;. It is generally accepted by historians that the vast daily losses that U.S. officers claimed to have inflicted on the VC were fabricated as many officers desperate for a promotion reported &quot;body counts&quot; well above what they were actually achieving.

====Army opposition to counterinsurgency====
The U.S. Army sabotaged the efforts of Kennedy and McNamara to develop a more counterinsurgency role by simply declaring that the Army&#x27;s basic unit, the division, was flexible enough to engage against guerrillas while also promising that the traditional fondness for using maximum firepower would not present a problem as firepower use would be &quot;discriminating&quot;. In Vietnam, this led to divisions, whose size limited them and their supply trains to the road, using massive amounts of firepower against guerrillas who were often &quot;nimble&quot; enough to evade all of the firepower brought to bear. Instead, the standard tactics of bringing massive firepower to bear in the form of napalm and artillery strikes against the guerrillas often killed civilians, fueling support for the VC. The Special Forces did fight in Vietnam, but only as an adjutant to the traditional infantry and armored divisions, which did most of the fighting. In a 1966 memo, McNamara admitted that the sort of counterinsurgency war envisioned by Kennedy with the Special Forces leading the fight had not occurred and wrote that the responsibility for this &quot;undoubtedly lies with bad management&quot; on the part of the Army.

====Disenchantment====
In November 1965, McNamara, who had been a supporter of the war, first started to have doubts about the war, saying at a press conference that &quot;it will be a long war&quot;, which completely contradicted his previous optimistic statements that the war would be brought to a close soon. Although he was a prime architect of the Vietnam War and repeatedly overruled the JCS on strategic matters, McNamara gradually became skeptical about whether the war could be won by deploying more troops to South Vietnam and intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam, a claim he published in a book years later. He also stated later that his support of the war was given out of loyalty to administration policy. He traveled to South Vietnam many times to study the situation firsthand and became increasingly reluctant to approve the large force increments requested by the military commanders.

As a Christmas gesture, Johnson ordered a bombing pause over North Vietnam and went off to his ranch in Texas for the holidays. McNamara went with his family for skiing in Colorado, but upon hearing that the president was open to extending the bombing pause for a few more days, he left his family at the sky lodge in the Rockies to fly to the Johnson ranch on 27 December 1965. McNamara knew that Johnson tended to listen to the advice of Rusk who saw extending the bombing pause as weakness and wanted a meeting with Johnson without Rusk present. McNamara argued to the president in a three hour long meeting that the North Vietnamese would not open peace talks unless the bombing were stopped first, as they kept saying repeatedly, and persuaded Johnson to extend the bombing pause into January. At a New Year&#x27;s Eve party attended by Washington&#x27;s elite to welcome 1966, McNamara expressed doubts about America&#x27;s ability to win the war. A week later at a dinner party attended by the economist John Kenneth Galbraith and Johnson&#x27;s speechwriter Dick Goodwin, McNamara stated that victory was unobtainable, and the best that could be achieved was an &quot;honorable withdrawal&quot; that might save South Vietnam as a state. 
In February 1966, during the Honolulu conference, McNamara during an &quot;off-the-record&quot; chat with a group of journalists spoke about the war in very jaded terms, stating frankly that Operation Rolling Thunder was a failure. McNamara stated that North Vietnam was a backward Third World country that did not have the same advanced industrial infrastructure of First World nations, making the bombing offensive useless. McNamara concluded: &quot;No amount of bombing can end the war&quot;. Karnow, one of the journalists present during the &quot;off-the-record&quot; conversation, described McNamara&#x27;s personality as having changed, noting the Defense Secretary, who was normally so arrogant and self-assured, convinced he could &quot;scientifically&quot; solve any problem, as being subdued and clearly less self-confident.

====McNamara Line====

After long study, in September 1966 McNamara ordered the construction of a &quot;barrier line&quot; to detect the infiltration of North Vietnamese forces into southern Laos, South Vietnam, and Cambodia that would help direct air strikes. Physically, the McNamara Line ran across South Vietnam to the Laotian border along the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The Vietnam barrier and its Laotian extension also used innovative air-dropped sensors under Operation Igloo White. Igloo White cost between $1 and $1.7 billion to design and build, and an additional billion dollars per year to operate over the five-year life of the operation; controversy has surrounded accounts of its effectiveness.

====1966 fact-finding mission====
In October 1966, McNamara returned from yet another visit to South Vietnam, full of confidence in public and doubt in private. McNamara told the media that &quot;process has exceeded our expectations&quot; while telling the president he saw &quot;no reasonable way to bring the war to an end soon&quot;. Though McNamara reported to Johnson that American forces were inflicting heavy losses on the North Vietnamese and VC, he added that they could &quot;more than replace&quot; their losses and that &quot;full security exists nowhere&quot; in South Vietnam, even in areas supposedly &quot;pacified&quot; by the Americans. Worst of all, McNamara complained that the South Vietnamese were still not carrying their full share of the load, as they expected the Americans to do all the fighting for them, stating: &quot;This important war must be fought and won by the Vietnamese themselves. We have known this from the beginning. But the discouraging truth is that, as was the case in 1961 and 1963 and 1965, we have not found the formula, the catalyst, for training and inspiring them into effective action&quot;.

====Project 100,000====

In October 1966, he launched Project 100,000, the lowering of military Armed Forces Qualification Test standards, which allowed 354,000 additional men to be recruited, despite criticism that they were not suited to working in high-stress or dangerous environments. According to Hamilton Gregory, author of the book &quot;McNamara&#x27;s Folly: The Use of Low-IQ Troops in the Vietnam War&quot;, inductees of the project died at three times the rate of other Americans serving in Vietnam and following their service had lower incomes and higher rates of divorce than their non-veteran counterparts.

====Antiwar confrontation====
In November 1966, McNamara visited Harvard University and the car driving him to see Henry Kissinger was surrounded by anti-war protesters who forced the automobile to stop The students refused to let the car move until McNamara debated their leader, Michael Ansara, the president of the Harvard chapter of Students for a Democratic Society. McNamara agreed to the debate, and standing on the hood of his car answered the charge from a student in the crowd that the United States was waging aggression by saying the war started in 1954, not 1957, which he knew &quot;because the International Control Commission wrote a report that said so. You haven&#x27;t read it, and if you have, you obviously didn&#x27;t understand it&quot;. When the student answered that he had read the International Control Commission&#x27;s report and it did not say that, McNamara responded he had been a far better university student than his opponent, saying &quot;I was tougher than you then and I&#x27;m tougher today! I was more courteous then, and I hope I&#x27;m more courteous today!&quot;. As McNamara continued to insult the crowd and the mood grew uglier, he fled into Quincy House, from which he escaped via underground tunnels to see Kissinger. The confrontation with the students had shaken him, and it took half an hour before he was ready to address Kissinger&#x27;s class.

====Failures====
Because the effects of Operation Rolling Thunder were more easily measured than with the ground war, McNamara was especially troubled by the revelation that the bombing offensive had not caused the collapse of North Vietnam&#x27;s economy as predicted. In June 1967, American bombers hit North Vietnam&#x27;s hydroelectric plants and reduced North Vietnam capacity to generate electricity by 85%, according to McNamara&#x27;s calculations. At the same time, he also calculated that the annual amount of electricity generated in North Vietnam was equal only to a fifth of the electricity generated every year at the Potomac Electric Power Company&#x27;s plant in Alexandria, Virginia, making the destruction of North Vietnamese power plants meaningless to the outcome of the war as the amount of electricity generated was so small. He also calculated in 1967 that over the last two years, American bombers had inflicted damage on North Vietnam equal to about $300 million while at the same time, Rolling Thunder had cost the U.S. Air Force about 700 aircraft shot down over North Vietnam whose total value was about $900 million, making the bombing campaign uneconomical. 

McNamara&#x27;s doubts were encouraged by his civilian aides such as Leslie H. Gelb and John McNaughton, who complained that their wives and teenage children were chiding them as &quot;war criminals&quot; when they came home from work. McNamara&#x27;s own teenage son, Robert Craig McNamara, was opposed to the war and denounced his father when he came from work every day. McNamara was shocked to discover that the American flag was hanging upside down in his son&#x27;s bedroom as the younger McNamara told him that he was ashamed of America because of him. McNaughton told McNamara that after having talked to some of the young people that &quot;a feeling is widely and strongly held...that &#x27;the Establishment&#x27; is out of its mind&quot; and the dominant opinion was &quot;that we are trying to impose some U.S. image on distant peoples we cannot understand and that we carrying the thing to absurd lengths.&quot;

In a memo of 19 May 1967 to the president, McNamara stated the military side of the war was going well with the Americans killing thousands of the enemy every month, but the political side was not, as South Vietnam remained as dysfunctional as ever. He wrote: &quot;Corruption is widespread. Real government control is confined to enclaves. There is rot in the fabric&quot;. McNamara wrote that the idea that the American forces would temporarily stabilize the situation so the South Vietnamese could take over the war themselves was flawed as the dysfunctional South Vietnamese state would never be able to win the war, thus meaning the Americans would have to stay in Vietnam for decades to come. He advised Johnson not to accept Westmoreland&#x27;s call for an additional 200,000 soldiers as that would mean calling up the Reserves, which in turn would require a wartime economy. The economic sacrifices that ending the peacetime economy would entail would make it almost politically impossible to negotiate peace, and in effect would mean placing the hawks in charge, which was why those of a hawkish inclination kept pressing for the Reserves to be called up. The economic sacrifices could only be justified to the American people by saying the war would be brought to a victorious conclusion. McNamara rejected the advice of the hawks, warning that steps such as bombing North Vietnam&#x27;s dikes and locks to flood the farmland with the aim of causing a famine; mining the coast of North Vietnam to sink Soviet ships bringing in arms; invading Laos and Cambodia; and finally in the last resort using nuclear weapons if the other measures failed were likely to alienate world opinion and increase domestic opposition. McNamara wrote: &quot;The picture of the world&#x27;s greatest superpower killing or seriously injuring 1,000 noncombatants a week, while trying to pound a tiny backward nation into submission on an issue whose merits are hotly disputed, is not a pretty one&quot;. 

Finally, McNamara dismissed the Domino Theory as irrelevant since General Suharto had seized power in Indonesia in 1965 and proceeded to wipe out the Indonesian Communist Party, the third-largest in the world, killing hundreds of thousands of Indonesian Communists. He argued that with Suharto in power in Indonesia, &quot;the trend in Asia was now running in America&#x27;s favor, which reduced the importance of South Vietnam&quot;. To the Americans, Indonesia was the most important of all the &quot;dominoes&quot; in Southeast Asia, and McNamara argued that even if the South Vietnamese &quot;domino&quot; were to fall, the Indonesian &quot;domino&quot; would still stand. 

====Pentagon Papers origins====

McNamara commissioned the Vietnam Study Task Force on June 17, 1967. He was inspired by the confrontation at Harvard the previous November as he had discovered that the students he had been debating knew more about Vietnam&#x27;s history than he did. The task was assigned to Gelb and six officials whom McNamara instructed to examine just how and why the United States became involved in Vietnam, by answering his list of 100 questions starting with American relations with the Viet Minh in World War II. McNamara expected them to be done by September 1967; they finished by January 1969. Though Gelb was a hawk who had written pro-war speeches for the Republican Senator Jacob Javits, he and his team, which grew to 36 members by 1969, became disillusioned as they wrote the history; at one point when discussing what were the lessons of Vietnam, future general Paul F. Gorman, one of the historians, went up to the blackboard to write simply, &quot;Don&#x27;t.&quot; The team counted Gelb, Gorman, Melvin Gurtov, Hans Heymann, Richard Moorstein, Daniel Ellsberg, Richard Holbrooke, John Galvin, Paul Warnke and Morton Halperin among its members.

By January 1969, &quot;The Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force&quot;, as the Pentagon Papers were officially titled, was finished but widely ignored within the government. Gelb recalled that he presented the Papers to McNamara early that year, but McNamara did not read them then, and Gelb did not know as late as 2018 if McNamara ever did. Intended as the official record of US military involvement in Indochina, the final report ran to 7,000 pages and was classified as &quot;Top Secret – Sensitive.&quot; 

The report was ultimately leaked in 1971 to &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Daniel Ellsberg, a former aide to McNamara&#x27;s Assistant Secretary of Defense, John McNaughton. The leaked study became known as the Pentagon Papers, revealing that McNamara and others had been aware that the Vietnam offensive was futile. Subsequent efforts by the Nixon administration to prevent such leaks led indirectly to the Watergate scandal. In an interview, McNamara said that the Domino Theory was the main reason for entering the Vietnam War. He also stated, &quot;Kennedy hadn&#x27;t said before he died whether, faced with the loss of Vietnam, he would [completely] withdraw; but I believe today that had he faced that choice, he would have withdrawn.&quot;

===Equality of opportunity===
To commemorate President Harry S Truman&#x27;s signing an order to end segregation in the military, McNamara issued Directive 5120.36 on July 26, 1963. This directive, &quot;Equal Opportunity in the Armed Forces&quot;, dealt directly with the issue of racial and gender discrimination in areas surrounding military communities. The directive declared, &quot;Every military commander has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they may live or gather in off-duty hours.&quot; (para. II.C.) Under the directive, commanding officers were obligated to use the economic power of the military to influence local businesses in their treatment of minorities and women. With the approval of the Secretary of Defense, the commanding officer could declare areas off-limits to military personnel for discriminatory practices.

===Diego Garcia===

In July 1961, McNamara was informed by the British Defence Minister, Peter Thorneycroft, that the financial burden of trying to maintain British forces around the world was too much, and that the British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was considering a withdrawal of all British forces &quot;East of Suez&quot; to end the British military presence in Asia. McNamara was opposed to this and the U.S. Navy began lobbying for Britain to allow an American naval base to be set up in the Indian Ocean. This was endorsed in a Joint Chiefs of Staff memo in January 1962 which expressed concern with the rise nationalist movements in British colonies, that could seek the withdrawal of American forces.

In September 1962, Thorneycroft visited Washington to meet McNamara and to begin talks over which British island in the Indian Ocean was to have the American base. By 1963, the Americans had selected the island of Diego Garcia in the Chagos Archipelago, which was part of the Crown colony of British Mauritius as the ideal place for air and naval bases. McNamara offered to have the United States pay $15 million U.S. dollars annually in rent to the British government for a base on Diego Garcia, a sum that was agreeable to London. In 1965, the Chagos Islands were severed from the Mauritius colony (which gained independence in March 1968 and would claim the Chagos Islands as its own territory through the 2020s) and turned into the British Indian Ocean Territory as the prelude for the projected American base.

In 1966, in a meeting with Defence Minister Denis Healey, McNamara pressed for the British to remain in Asia, saying he wanted them to keep their base in Singapore. Healey offered evasive answers, claiming that his government wanted to keep the Singapore base, but its financial costs were draining the British exchequer. In July 1966, McNamara told Johnson that it was &quot;absolutely essential&quot; for the British to remain &quot;East of Suez&quot;, citing political rather military reasons, namely that it showed the importance of the region, which thus justified the America&#x27;s involvement in Vietnam. To placate the Americans, the British were willing to offer a lease on Diego Garcia on almost any terms favorable to the Americans. The Americans informed the British that they wanted all of the native Chagossians expelled from the island, a request to which the British agreed. In January 1968, Wilson announced that with the exception of Hong Kong, all British forces would be withdrawn &quot;East of Suez&quot; in order to save money. Starting in 1968, British authorities began expelling the Chagossians from Diego Garcia, with the process completed by 1973.

===Departure===
McNamara wrote of his close personal friendship with Jacqueline Kennedy and how she demanded that he stop the killing in Vietnam. As McNamara grew more and more controversial after 1966 and his differences with the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff over Vietnam War strategy became public speculation, frequent rumors surfaced that he would leave office. By 1967, McNamara was suffering visibly from the nervous strain as he went days without shaving and he suffered spasms where his jaw would quiver uncontrollably for hours. Johnson said about him: &quot;You know, he&#x27;s a fine man, a wonderful man, Bob McNamara. He has given everything, just about everything, and, you know, we just can&#x27;t afford another Forrestal&quot; (a reference to the first Defense Secretary, James Forrestal, who committed suicide due to work-related stress and depression).  

====Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing====
Senator John C. Stennis was a conservative Southern Democrat who enjoyed much influence as a senior member of the Senate Armed Forces Committee. Stennis saw himself more as a champion of the military rather than its overseer, and as such the military often leaked information to him, in the full knowledge that he would take up their cause on Capitol Hill. Reflecting their unhappiness with McNamara&#x27;s leadership, in the spring of 1967 senior generals and admirals let Stennis know of their belief that the Defense Secretary was mismanaging the war. This led Stennis to schedule hearings for the Senate Armed Forces Committee in August 1967 to examine the charge that &quot;unskilled civilian amateurs&quot; (i.e. McNamara) were not letting &quot;professional military experts&quot; win the war. He charged that McNamara had placed too many restrictions on bombing North Vietnam to protect innocent North Vietnamese civilians. The chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, Senator Richard Russell Jr., was opposed to the war, but he expressed his opposition in the most cautious and lukewarm terms as he did not wish to appear unpatriotic, and so the hawkish Stennis enjoyed more power than his title of deputy chairman of the committee would suggest.

The hearings opened on 8 August 1967, and Stennis called as his witnesses numerous admirals and Air Force generals who all testified to their belief that the United States was fighting with &quot;one arm tied behind its back&quot;, implicitly criticizing McNamara&#x27;s leadership. They complained of &quot;overtly restrictive controls&quot; in bombing North Vietnam that they claimed were preventing them from winning the war. When McNamara himself appeared as a witness before the Senate Armed Forces Committee on 25 August 1967, he defended the war in very lukewarm terms that strongly suggested he had lost faith in the war, testifying that the bombing campaign against North Vietnam was ineffective, making the question of the bombing restrictions meaningless. McNamara described all of the 57 restricted targets as either of no importance such as a tire factory in Hanoi that produced only 30 tires per day or carried too much risk of hitting Soviet ships bringing supplies to North Vietnam. He warned that the prospect of American bombers damaging or sinking Soviet merchantmen while wounding or killing Soviet sailors carried too much risk of causing World War Three. McNamara testified that the bombing campaign had failed to reduce the supplies coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail as the Viet Cong needed only 15 tons of supplies per day to continue to fight and &quot;even if the quantity were five times that amount, it could be transported by only a few trucks&quot;. McNamara went on to say that the bombing raids had not damaged the North Vietnamese economy which was &quot;agrarian and simple&quot; and the North Vietnamese people were unfamiliar with &quot;the modern comforts and conveniences that most of us in the Western world take for granted&quot;. McNamara also stated that North Vietnamese morale was not broken by the bombing offensive as the North Vietnamese people were &quot;accustomed to discipline and are no strangers to deprivation and death&quot; while everything indicated the leadership in Hanoi were not affected by the bombing raids. Thus, he lacked &quot;any confidence that they can be bombed to the negotiating table&quot;. McNamara concluded that only some sort of genocide could actually win the war, stating: &quot;Enemy operations in the south cannot, on the basis of any reports I have seen be stopped by air bombardment-short, that is, of the virtual annihilation of North Vietnam and its people&quot;.

Besides Stennis, the other members of the Senate Armed Forces Committee were senators Henry M. Jackson, Strom Thurmond and Stuart Symington, all of whom were very hostile to McNamara in their questioning of him. Senator Thurmond reproached McNamara: &quot;I think it is a statement of placating the Communists. It is a statement of appeasing the Communists. It is a statement of no-win&quot;. Privately, McNamara felt that Thurmond was an &quot;ass&quot;, saying he was a bigoted, ignorant Southern politician whose only values were a mindless militarism, a fervent belief in white supremacy and a fondness for marrying women far younger than himself. McNamara felt that it was beneath him to be questioned by Thurmond, which explained why he was notably truculent in his answers to him.    

Stennis wrote the committee&#x27;s report which accused McNamara of having &quot;consistently overruled the unanimous recommendations of military commanders and the joint chiefs of staff&quot;, whom Stennis wrote had proposed &quot;systematic, timely and hard-hitting actions&quot;. Stennis damned McNamara for putting in bombing restrictions to protect North Vietnamese civilians and claimed that the war could be easily won if only McNamara would just obey all of the advice he received from the military. Stennis was not influenced by the hearings as he had written the committee&#x27;s report before the hearings had even began. 

Johnson saw the hearings as proof that it was time to dismiss McNamara, whom he believed was &quot;cracking up&quot; under the strain of the war, as reflected in the Defense Secretary&#x27;s criticism of the Rolling Thunder bombings. Stennis, an ardent white supremacist who had fiercely opposed Johnson&#x27;s civil rights legislation, was an old enemy of Johnson&#x27;s, which led the president to decide not to sack McNamara in August 1967 as that would be seen as a victory by Stennis, and instead to wait a few months to fire him. In an interview with his biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Johnson stated that McNamara was &quot;cracking up&quot; as the pressures of the war were too much for him, and so he decided to fire him as it would have been &quot;a damn unfair thing to force him to stay&quot;. Johnson had long resented and hated the Kennedy brothers, whom he thought looked down upon him as &quot;white trash&quot; from Texas. Senator Robert F. Kennedy had emerged as a leading critic of the war by 1967, and Johnson stated to Kearns his belief that McNamara had suffered a nervous breakdown, of which Kennedy, a close friend of McNamara, had taken advantage of. Johnson told Kearns: &quot;Every day, Bobby [Kennedy] would call up McNamara telling him that the war was terrible and immoral, and that he had to leave&quot;. To soften the blow, Johnson claimed to Kearns that he had talked it over with McNamara and had decided to offer him the presidency of the World Bank, &quot;the only job he really wanted then&quot;. Johnson had chosen the job of World Bank president for McNamara because its rules prohibited the president from involving himself in the domestic affairs of member nations, which would prevent McNamara from criticizing the war after he left office. Johnson&#x27;s biggest fear was that if he fired McNamara, then he might join with Kennedy in criticizing him and the war; given his status as the longest-serving Defense Secretary, such criticism would be especially damaging. 

When a reporter asked McNamara if the Stennis hearings indicated a rift between him and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, McNamara replied: &quot;My polices don&#x27;t differ with those of the Joint Chiefs and I think they would be the first to say it&quot;. General Earle Wheeler, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had become dissatisfied with McNamara&#x27;s leadership and was outraged by that remark. In response to McNamara&#x27;s claim that the Joint Chiefs supported him, he proposed that the Joint Chiefs all resign in protest at McNamara&#x27;s leadership. General Harold K. Johnson of the Army, who erroneously blamed McNamara for Johnson&#x27;s decision not to call up the Reserves in 1965, agreed to Wheeler&#x27;s plan with his only regret being that he did not resign in 1965. The plan collapsed when General Wallace M. Greene of the Marine Corps refused to go along with it.

====March on the Pentagon====
On 21 October 1967, McNamara saw the March on the Pentagon anti-war protest from his office in the Pentagon. He witnessed hippie girls placing flowers in the guns of the D.C National Guardsmen standing in front of the Pentagon. McNamara described the scene as &quot;hellish&quot; as the hippie girls bared their breasts to tempt the Guardsmen to &quot;make love, not war&quot; while other hippies spat in the faces of the Guardsmen. However, despite seeing the March on the Pentagon demonstrators as a sign of social decay, his characteristic competitive spirit came to the fore as he argued that if he had been leading the March on the Pentagon, he would have taken over the Pentagon and shut it down, saying hippies lacked the necessary discipline and intelligence. On 31 October 1967, McNamara wrote Johnson a memo which he sent the next day saying that the war could not be continued as it &quot;would be dangerous, costly in lives and unsatisfactory to the American people&quot;. Johnson wrote on the margins on the memo remarks such as &quot;How do we get this conclusion?&quot; and &quot;Why believe this?&quot;

====Resignation====
In an early November 1967 memorandum to Johnson, McNamara&#x27;s recommendation to freeze troop levels, stop bombing North Vietnam and for the U.S. to hand over ground fighting to South Vietnam was rejected outright by the President. McNamara&#x27;s recommendations amounted to his saying that the strategy of the United States in Vietnam which had been pursued to date had failed. McNamara later stated he &quot;never heard back&quot; from Johnson regarding the memo. Largely as a result, on November 29 of that year, McNamara announced his pending resignation and that he would become President of the World Bank. Other factors were the increasing intensity of the anti-war movement in the U.S., the approaching presidential campaign in which Johnson was expected to seek re-election, and McNamara&#x27;s support—over the objections of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, of construction along the 17th parallel separating South and North Vietnam of a line of fortifications running from the coast of Vietnam into Laos. The President&#x27;s announcement of McNamara&#x27;s move to the World Bank stressed his stated interest in the job and that he deserved a change after seven years as Secretary of Defense (longer than any of his predecessors or successors).

Others give a different view of McNamara&#x27;s departure from office. For example, Stanley Karnow in his book &quot;Vietnam: A History&quot; strongly suggests that McNamara was asked to leave by the President. The historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr stated that he was present during a conversation between McNamara and Senator Kennedy during which the former told the latter that he only learned from reading the newspapers of Johnson&#x27;s announcement that he had just &quot;resigned&quot; as Defense Secretary and had been appointed president of the World Bank. McNamara himself expressed uncertainty about the question. On 17 November 1967, a story in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; of London based on leaked sources in Washington stated McNamara was going to be the next World Bank president, which came as a considerable surprise to McNamara. Afterwards, McNamara met with Kennedy who told him to resign in protest and denounce the war as unwinnable, counsel that McNamara rejected, saying that Johnson had been a friend and that he was still loyal to him. When McNamara refused to resign, Kennedy told him that he should turn down the World Bank presidency and join him in criticizing the war, which McNamara refused to do. Johnson knew that McNamara was concerned about poverty in the Third World, and that the possibility of serving as World Bank president would be too tempting for McNamara to resist.

McNamara left office on February 29, 1968; for his efforts, the President awarded him both the Medal of Freedom and the Distinguished Service Medal. McNamara&#x27;s last day as Defense Secretary was a memorable one. The hawkish National Security Adviser, Walt Rostow, argued at a cabinet meeting that day that the United States was on the verge of winning the war. Rostow urged Johnson to send 206,000 more American troops to South Vietnam to join the half-million already there and to drastically increase the number of bombing raids on North Vietnam. At that point, McNamara snapped in fury at Rostow, saying: &quot;What then? This goddamned bombing campaign, it&#x27;s worth nothing, it&#x27;s done nothing, they dropped more bombs than on all of Europe in all of World War II and it hasn&#x27;t done a fucking thing!&quot; McNamara then broke down in tears, saying to Johnson to just accept that the war could not be won and stop listening to Rostow. Henry McPherson, an aide to the president, recalled the scene: &quot;He reeled off the familiar statistics-how we had dropped more bombs on Vietnam than on all of Europe during World War II. Then his voice broke, and there were tears on his eyes as he spoke of the futility, the crushing futility of the air war. The rest of us sat silently-I for one with my mouth open, listening to the secretary of defense talk that way about a campaign for which he had, ultimately, been responsible. I was pretty shocked&quot;.  

Shortly after McNamara departed the Pentagon, he published &quot;The Essence of Security&quot;, discussing various aspects of his tenure and position on basic national security issues. He did not speak out again on defense issues or Vietnam until after he left the World Bank.

===Legacy===
====Gradualism====
McNamara&#x27;s advocacy of gradual escalations of military power, seen first in the Cuban Missile Crisis and later Indochina, was repudiated by later strategists. The 1991 Gulf War was deliberately conducted by American forces with a non-gradualist strategy; per General Jimmie V. Adams: “I think we learned a lot of lessons in Vietnam, and one of them is that gradualism does not work.”

====McNamara fallacy====

McNamara&#x27;s bias in favor of quantitative metrics to the detriment of qualitative considerations has been seen as an example of flawed decision making, and has been christened the &quot;McNamara fallacy&quot;.

==World Bank president==

Robert McNamara served as head of the World Bank from April 1968 to June 1981, when he turned 65. In March 1968, McNamara&#x27;s friend Senator Robert Kennedy entered the Democratic primaries with aim of challenging Johnson. Kennedy asked McNamara to tape a statement praising his leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis with the understanding that the statement was meant for a TV ad. McNamara praised Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;shrewd diplomacy&quot;, saying he had &quot;remained calm and cool, firm, but restrained, never nettled and never rattled&quot;. Though this was a violation of World Bank rules, McNamara felt guilty over refusing Kennedy&#x27;s requests to resign and decline the World Bank presidency. He was attacked for the tape with the &quot;New York Times&quot; in an editorial lambasting him for his &quot;poor judgement and poorer taste&quot;. For a moment, McNamara feared he would be fired from the World Bank.

A safe was installed in McNamara&#x27;s office at the World Bank to house his papers relating to his time as Defense Secretary, which was a normal courtesy extended to former Defense Secretaries who might face controversy over their actions and wish to defend themselves by quoting from the documentary record. When the Pentagon Papers were finished in April 1969, and a copy of the Papers were brought into McNamara&#x27;s office, he became angry and said: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see it! Take it back!&quot; By 1969, McNamara wanted to forget the Vietnam war and did not want any reminders of his former job.

=== Tenure ===
In his 13 years at the Bank, he introduced key changes, most notably, shifting the Bank&#x27;s economic development policies toward targeted poverty reduction. Prior to his tenure at the World Bank, poverty did not receive substantial attention as part of international and national economic development; the focus of development had been on industrialization and infrastructure. Poverty also came to be redefined as a condition faced by people rather than countries. According to Martha Finnemore, the World Bank under McNamara&#x27;s tenure &quot;sold&quot; states poverty reduction &quot;through a mixture of persuasion and coercion.&quot; McNamara negotiated, with the conflicting countries represented on the Board, a growth in funds to channel credits for development, in the form of health, food, and education projects. He also instituted new methods of evaluating the effectiveness of funded projects. One notable project started during McNamara&#x27;s tenure was the effort to prevent river blindness.

In 1972, McNamara visited Santiago to meet President Salvador Allende to discuss the latter&#x27;s policy of nationalization, especially of the copper mining companies. McNamara&#x27;s son, Craig McNamara was living in Chile at the time, but the two did not meet owing to the rift over the Vietnam war. McNamara &quot;fils&quot; stated in 1984: &quot;I think my father truly respected Allende-his compassion, his humility. But he disapproved of the nationalizations&quot;. The meeting with Allende concluded with McNamara ending all World Bank loans to Chile. On 11 September 1973, Allende was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état led by General Augusto Pinochet. In 1974, McNamara visited Santiago to meet Pinochet and agreed to the World Bank resuming loans to Chile. Craig McNamara, who was visiting the United States at the time of the coup and chose not to return to Chile was outraged by the decision to resume the loans, telling his father in a phone call: &quot;You can&#x27;t do this-you always say the World Bank is not a political institution, but financing Pinochet clearly would be&quot;. McNamara &quot;pere&quot; flatly stated in reply: &quot;It&#x27;s too late. I&#x27;ve already made my decision&quot;. McNamara &quot;fils&quot; feels that his father&#x27;s claim that he had to cease loans to Chile because the Allende government&#x27;s nationalization policy was an &quot;economic&quot; matter that fell within the purview of the World Bank, but human rights abuses under Pinochet were a &quot;political&quot; matter that was outside of the World Bank&#x27;s purview was disingenuous and dishonest. Craig McNamara stated: &quot;I was really upset by that. That was hard to mend&quot;.

The World Bank currently has a scholarship program under his name.

As World Bank President, he declared at the 1968 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources. During the 1975-1977 emergency in India, McNamara remarked &quot;At long last, India is moving to effectively address its population problem,&quot; regarding the forced sterilization.

==Post-World Bank activities and assessments==

From 1981 to 1984, McNamara served on the board of trustees at American University in Washington, D.C.

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1981.

In 1982, McNamara joined several other former national security officials in urging that the United States pledge to not use nuclear weapons first in Europe in the event of hostilities; subsequently he proposed the elimination of nuclear weapons as an element of NATO&#x27;s defense posture.

In 1993, Washington journalist Deborah Shapley published a 615-page biography of Robert McNamara titled &quot;Promise and Power: The Life and Times of Robert McNamara&quot;. Shapley concluded her book with these words: &quot;For better and worse McNamara shaped much in today&#x27;s world—and imprisoned himself. A little-known nineteenth century writer, F.W. Boreham, offers a summation: &#x27;We make our decisions. And then our decisions turn around and make us.&#x27;&quot;

McNamara&#x27;s memoir, &quot;In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam&quot;, published in 1995, presented an account and analysis of the Vietnam War from his point of view. According to his lengthy &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, &quot;[h]e concluded well before leaving the Pentagon that the war was futile, but he did not share that insight with the public until late in life. In 1995, he took a stand against his own conduct of the war, confessing in a memoir that it was &#x27;wrong, terribly wrong&#x27;.&quot; In return, he faced a &quot;firestorm of scorn&quot; at that time.

In November 1995, McNamara returned to Vietnam, this time visiting Hanoi. Despite his role as one of the architects of Operation Rolling Thunder, McNamara met with a surprisingly warm reception, even from those who survived the bombing raids, and was often asked to autograph pirate editions of &quot;In Retrospect&quot; which had been illegally translated and published in Vietnam. During his visit, McNamara met his opposite number during the war, General Võ Nguyên Giáp who served as North Vietnam&#x27;s Defense Minister. During his conversation, McNamara brought up the Gulf of Tonkin incident and asked Giáp what happened on August 4, 1964. &quot;Absolutely nothing&quot;, Giáp replied. Giáp confirmed that the attack on 4 August 1964 had been imaginary while also confirming that the attack on August 2 happened.

The American historian Charles Neu who was present at the McNamara-Giáp meeting observed the differences in the style of the two men with McNamara repeatedly interrupting Giáp to ask questions, usually related to something numerical, while Giáp gave a long leisurely monologue, quoting various Vietnamese cultural figures such as poets, that began with Vietnamese revolts against China during the years 111 BC–938 AD when Vietnam was a Chinese province. Neu wrote his impression was that McNamara was a figure who thought in the short term while Giáp thought in the long term.

&quot;The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara&quot; is a 2003 Errol Morris documentary consisting mostly of interviews with Robert McNamara and archival footage. It went on to win the Academy Award for Documentary Feature. The particular structure of this personal account is accomplished with the characteristics of an intimate dialogue. As McNamara explains, it is a process of examining the experiences of his long and controversial period as the United States Secretary of Defense, as well as other periods of his personal and public life.

McNamara maintained his involvement in politics in his later years, delivering statements critical of the Bush administration&#x27;s 2003 invasion of Iraq. On January 5, 2006, McNamara and most living former Secretaries of Defense and Secretaries of State met briefly at the White House with President Bush to discuss the war.

==Personal life==
McNamara married Margaret Craig, his teenage sweetheart, on August 13, 1940. She was an accomplished cook, and Robert&#x27;s favorite dish was reputed to be her beef bourguignon. Margaret McNamara, a former teacher, used her position as a Cabinet spouse to launch a reading program for young children, Reading Is Fundamental, which became the largest literacy program in the country. She died of cancer in 1981. Later that summer, her ashes were scattered by her family on a mountainside meadow at Buckskin Pass, near Snowmass Village, Colorado.

The couple had two daughters and a son. Their son, Robert Craig McNamara, who as a student objected to the Vietnam War, is a farmer in California.

=== At Ford ===

When working at Ford Motor Company, McNamara resided in Ann Arbor, Michigan, rather than the usual auto executive domains of Grosse Pointe, Birmingham, and Bloomfield Hills. He and his wife sought to remain connected with a university town (the University of Michigan) after their hopes of returning to Harvard after the war were put on hold.

=== Alumnus of the Year ===

In 1961, he was named Alumnus of the Year by the University of California, Berkeley.

=== Attempted assault ===

On September 29, 1972, a passenger on the ferry to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard recognized McNamara on board and attempted to throw him into the ocean. McNamara declined to press charges. The man remained anonymous but was interviewed years later by author Paul Hendrickson, who quoted the attacker as saying, &quot;I just wanted to confront (McNamara) on Vietnam.&quot;

=== Final years and death ===
After his wife&#x27;s death, McNamara dated Katharine Graham, with whom he had been friends since the early 1960s. Graham died in 2001.

In September 2004, McNamara wed Diana Masieri Byfield, an Italian-born widow who had lived in the United States for more than 40 years. It was her second marriage. She was married to Ernest Byfield, a former OSS officer and Chicago hotel owner, thirty years her senior, whose first wife, Gladys Rosenthal Tartiere, leased her 400-acre (1.6 km2) Glen Ora estate in Middleburg, Virginia, to John F. Kennedy during his presidency.

At the end of his life McNamara was a life trustee on the Board of Trustees of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security, a trustee of the American University of Nigeria, and an honorary trustee for the Brookings Institution.

McNamara died at his home in Washington, D.C., at 5:30 am on July 6, 2009, at the age of 93. He is buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, with the grave marker also commemorating his wives.

McNamara&#x27;s papers from his years as Secretary of Defense are housed in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, Massachusetts.

<doc id="80224" wikidata="Q386798" url="?curid=80224" title="Clark Clifford">
<text>Clark McAdams Clifford (December 25, 1906October 10, 1998) was an American lawyer who served as an important political adviser to Democratic presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Jimmy Carter. His official government positions were White House Counsel (1946–1950), Chairman of the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board (1963–1968), and Secretary of Defense (1968–1969); Clifford was also influential in his role as an unofficial, informal presidential adviser in various issues. A successful Washington, D.C., lawyer, he was known for his elite clientele, charming manners, and impeccable suits.

All four Democratic presidents of the Cold War era employed Clifford&#x27;s services and relied on his counsel, marking him as one of the ultimate Washington insiders. Emblematic of Clifford&#x27;s influence in postwar Democratic presidential administrations was that after Jimmy Carter won the 1976 presidential election, his transition team was adamant that Clifford, as a symbol of the Washington, D.C., establishment, should not have any influence whatsoever, declaring that &quot;if you ever see us relying on Clark Clifford, you&#x27;ll know we have failed&quot;, yet Carter eventually came to rely on him nonetheless.

In his later years, Clifford became involved in several controversies. He was a key figure in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal, which led to a grand jury indictment.

== Early and personal life ==
Clifford was born on December 25, 1906, in Fort Scott, Kansas. His parents resided there at the time because his father, Frank, was a traveling auditor for Missouri Pacific Railroad. He was named after his maternal uncle, Clark McAdams. He attended Washington University in St. Louis.

On October 3, 1931, Clifford married Margery Pepperell &quot;Marny&quot; Kimball (April 20, 1908 – April 14, 2000). They had three daughters: Margery Clifford (nickname: Gery), Joyce Clifford Burland and Randall Clifford Wight.

Clifford was a self-proclaimed Christian Zionist.

==Career==

Clifford built a solid reputation practicing law in St. Louis between 1928 and 1943. He served as an officer in the U.S. Navy from 1944 to 1946.

===Presidential adviser===

In 1945 he was assigned to the White House and quickly promoted to captain while serving as assistant naval aide and then naval aide to President Harry S Truman. He became a trusted personal adviser and friend of Truman.

Clifford went to Washington, first to serve as assistant to the President&#x27;s Naval Adviser, after the naming of a personal friend from Missouri as the President&#x27;s Naval Adviser. Following his discharge from the Navy, he remained at Truman&#x27;s side as White House Counsel from 1946 to 1950, as Truman came rapidly to trust and rely upon Clifford.

Clifford was a key architect of Truman&#x27;s campaign in 1948, when Truman pulled off a stunning upset victory over Republican nominee Thomas Dewey. Clifford encouraged Truman to embrace a left-wing populist image in hope of undermining the impact on the race of third-party Progressive candidate Henry A. Wallace, who had served as President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Vice-President from 1941 to 1945. Clifford also believed that a strong pro-civil rights stance, while sure to alienate traditional Southern Democrats, would not result in a serious challenge to the party&#x27;s supremacy in that region. This prediction was foiled by Strom Thurmond&#x27;s candidacy as a splinter States&#x27; Rights Democrat, but Clifford&#x27;s strategy nonetheless helped win Truman election in his own right and establish the Democratic Party&#x27;s position in the Civil Rights Movement.

In his role as presidential adviser, one of his most significant contributions was his successful advocacy, along with David Niles, of prompt 1948 recognition of the new Jewish state of Israel, over the strong objections of Secretary of State General George Marshall.

Of similar importance, with the input of senior officials in the Departments of State, War, and Justice, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Central Intelligence Group, and utilizing the expertise of George F. Kennan and Charles Bohlen, was his preparation, along with George Elsey, of the top secret Clifford-Elsey Report for President Truman in 1946. That report, solicited by the President, which detailed the numerous ways in which the Soviet Union had gone back on its various treaties and understandings with the Western powers, along with Kennan&#x27;s X Article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, was instrumental in turning U.S. relations toward the Soviet Union in the direction of a harder line. During this period he participated extensively in the legislative efforts that resulted in the National Security Act of 1947 and its 1949 amendments.

After leaving the government in 1950, Clifford practiced law in Washington, D.C., but continued to advise Democratic Party leaders. One of his law clients was John F. Kennedy, then a U.S. Senator, and Clifford tried to assuage Truman&#x27;s suspicion of Kennedy and his father, Joseph P. Kennedy.

Clifford was the head of the presidential transition of John F. Kennedy. Clifford was also a member of President-elect Kennedy&#x27;s Committee on the Defense Establishment, headed by Stuart Symington. In May 1961, Kennedy appointed Clifford to the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which he chaired beginning in April 1963 and ending in January 1968.

After Johnson became president in November 1963 following Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Clifford served frequently as an unofficial White House Counsel and sometimes undertook short-term official duties, including a trip with General Maxwell Taylor in 1967 to South Vietnam and other countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.

===USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident===
Clifford served as the chairman of the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board during the 1967 Six-Day War. In this capacity, he oversaw the official investigation of the 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident. As a staunch supporter of Israel, he was perplexed by the Israeli government’s explanation following the attack: “We were baffled. From the beginning there was skepticism and disbelief about the Israeli version of events. We had enormous respect for Israeli intelligence and it was difficult to believe the &quot;Liberty&quot; had been attacked by mistake. Every conceivable theory was advanced that morning. It became clear that from the sketchy information available we could not figure out what happened.”

He delved deeper into the inconsistencies in the Israeli explanation: “That the &quot;Liberty&quot; could have been mistaken for the Egyptian supply ship &quot;El Quseir&quot; is unbelievable. &quot;El Quseir&quot; has one-fourth the displacement of the &quot;Liberty&quot;, roughly half the beam, is 180 feet shorter, and is very differently configured. The &quot;Liberty’s&quot; unusual antenna array and hull markings should have been visible to low-flying aircraft and torpedo boats. In the heat of battle the &quot;Liberty&quot; was able to identify one of the attacking torpedo boats as Israeli and to ascertain its hull number. In the same circumstances, trained Israeli naval personnel should have been able to easily see and identify the larger hull markings on the &quot;Liberty&quot;. The best interpretation of from available facts is that there were gross and inexcusable failures in the command and control of subordinate Israeli naval and air elements…The unprovoked attack on the &quot;Liberty&quot; constitutes a flagrant act of gross negligence for which the Israeli Government should be held completely responsible, and the Israeli military personnel involved should be punished.”

Immediately after the attack, he had pressured the Johnson administration to hold the Israelis responsible: “My concern is that we are not tough enough. Handle as if Arabs or USSR had done it. Manner egregious. Inconceivable that it was accident. 3 strafing passes, 3 torpedo boats. Set forth facts. Punish Israelis responsible.”

He expressed his desire to hold Israel accountable in an eponymous 1967 report that he had authored: “I do not know to this day at what level the attack on the &quot;Liberty&quot; was authorized and I think it is unlikely that the full truth will ever come out. Having been for so long a staunch supporter of Israel, I was particularly troubled by this incident; I could not bring myself to believe that such an action could have been authorized by Levi Eshkol. Yet somewhere inside the Israeli government, somewhere along the chain-of-command, something had gone terribly wrong – and then had been covered-up. I never felt the Israelis made adequate restitution or explanation for their actions.”

===Secretary of Defense===

On January 19, 1968, Johnson announced his selection of Clifford to succeed Robert McNamara as the U.S. Secretary of Defense. Clifford estimated that, in the year just prior to his appointment, he had spent about half of his time advising the President and the other half working for his law firm.
Widely known and respected in Washington and knowledgeable on defense matters, Clifford was generally hailed as a worthy successor to McNamara. Many regarded the new secretary as more of a hawk on Vietnam than McNamara, and thought his selection might presage an escalation of the U.S. military effort there. Clifford attempted to allay such fears when, responding to a query about whether he was a hawk (favoring aggressive military action) or a dove (favoring a peaceful resolution to the Vietnam War), he remarked, &quot;I am not conscious of falling under any of those ornithological divisions.&quot; Policy planning director Les Gelb recalled in 2018, however, that Clifford was secretly opposed to the war since 1965.

The new Secretary did not change the management system McNamara had installed at the Pentagon, and for the most part assigned internal administration to Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul H. Nitze. Clifford made no effort to depart from McNamara&#x27;s policies and programs on such matters as nuclear strategy, NATO, and military assistance, but he favored the Sentinel anti-ballistic missile system, to which McNamara had given only lukewarm backing. Clifford wanted to deploy the system, and supported congressional appropriations for it. One important effect of Sentinel construction, he thought, would be to encourage the Soviet Union to enter arms control talks with the U.S. Indeed, before Clifford left office, the Johnson administration made arrangements for negotiations that eventually led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.

Clifford continued McNamara&#x27;s highly publicized Cost Reduction Program, announcing that over $1.2 billion had been saved in fiscal year (FY) 1968 as a result of the effort. Faced with a congressionally mandated reduction of expenditures in FY 1969, Clifford suspended the planned activation of an infantry division and deactivated 50 small ships, 9 naval air squadrons, and 23 Nike-Hercules missile launch sites.

By the time Clifford became secretary, Defense Department work on the fiscal year 1969 budget was complete. It amounted in total obligational authority to $77.7 billion, almost $3 billion more than in FY 1968. The final FY 1970 budget, which Clifford and his staff worked on before they left office after the election of Richard Nixon to the presidency, amounted to $75.5 billion TOA (Total Obligational Authority).

===Vietnam===
Clifford took office committed to rethinking Johnson&#x27;s Vietnam policies, and Vietnam policy consumed most of his time. He had argued against escalation in 1965 in private counsel with the president, but then provided public support for the president&#x27;s position once the decision was made. At his confirmation hearing, he told the Armed Services Committee of the U.S. Senate that the limited objective of the U.S. was to guarantee to the people of South Vietnam the right of self-determination. He opposed ending the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam at the time, but acknowledged that the situation could change.

In fact, on March 31, 1968, just a month after Clifford arrived at the Pentagon, Johnson, in an effort to get peace talks started, ordered the cessation of bombing north of the 20th parallel, an area comprising almost 80 percent of North Vietnam&#x27;s land area and 90 percent of its population. In the same address, Johnson announced that he would not be a candidate for reelection in 1968, surprising everyone, Clifford included. Soon the North Vietnamese agreed to negotiations, which began in Paris in mid-May 1968. Later, on October 31, 1968, to encourage the success of these talks, the President, with Clifford&#x27;s strong support, ordered an end to all bombing in North Vietnam.

Clifford, like McNamara, had to deal with frequent requests for additional troops from military commanders in Vietnam. When he became secretary, the authorized force in Vietnam was 525,000. Soon after moving into his Pentagon office, Clifford persuaded Johnson to deny General William Westmoreland&#x27;s request for an additional 206,000 American troops in Vietnam.

At the end of March 1968, however, Johnson agreed to send 24,500 more troops on an emergency basis, raising authorized strength to 549,500, a figure never reached. Even as he oversaw a continued buildup, Clifford preferred to emphasize the points Johnson had made in his March 31, 1968, address: that the South Vietnamese army could take over a greater share of the fighting, that the administration would place an absolute limit on the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam, and that it would take steps, including the bombing restrictions, to reduce the combat level.

Eventually Clifford moved very close, with Johnson&#x27;s tacit support, to the views McNamara held on Vietnam just before he left office—no further increases in U.S. troop levels, support for the bombing halt and gradual disengagement from the conflict. By this time Clifford clearly disagreed with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who believed, according to &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; &quot;that the war was being won by the allies&quot; and that it &quot;would be won if America had the will to win it.&quot; He later recalled how he turned against the war: &quot;I found out that we couldn&#x27;t win the war with the limitations that we had, which I thought were correct limitations, and I thought all we were going to do was just waste the lives of our men and our treasure out in the jungles of North and South Vietnam.&quot;

After he left office, Clifford, in the July 1969 issue of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, made his views very clear: &quot;Nothing we might do could be so beneficial ... as to begin to withdraw our combat troops. Moreover ... we cannot realistically expect to achieve anything more through our military force, and the time has come to begin to disengage. That was my final conclusion as I left the Pentagon ...&quot;.

Although the Johnson Administration ended under the cloud of the Vietnam War, Clifford concluded his short term as Secretary of Defense with his reputation actually enhanced. He got along well with the U.S. Congress, and this helped him to secure approval of at least some of his proposals. He settled into his duties quickly and efficiently, and capably managed the initial de-escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam; indeed, he apparently strongly influenced Johnson in favor of a de-escalation strategy. As he left office to return to his law practice in Washington, Clifford expressed the hope and expectation that international tensions would abate, citing the shift in the Vietnam confrontation from the battlefield to the conference table, and the evident willingness of the Soviet Union to discuss limitations on strategic nuclear weapons.

=== Church Committee ===
On Friday, December 5, 1975, Clifford recommended to the Church Committee that the National Security Council and a Director General of Intelligence—not the Central Intelligence Agency—be the ones with the authority to decide whether or not to engage in covert action.

===Special presidential emissary to India===

Clifford&#x27;s legal practice and lobbying work made him wealthy, and he was considered one of Washington&#x27;s &quot;superlawyers&quot; due to the reach of his influence and seemingly limitless connections. Clifford&#x27;s office overlooked the White House, emphasizing his long experience in the capital.

In 1980, President Carter appointed him as special presidential emissary to India.

Clifford made waves by threatening the newly established regime of Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran with war for its intransigence in negotiating the release of the hostages seized from the U.S. embassy in Tehran.

He also referred to President Ronald Reagan as an &quot;amiable dunce&quot; at a Washington dinner party.

===Bank of Credit and Commerce International: the BCCI Scandal===

The Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal focused on the criminal conduct of the international bank and its control of financial institutions nationwide. The bank was found by regulators in the U.S. and the United Kingdom to be involved in money laundering, bribery, support of terrorism, arms trafficking, the sale of nuclear technologies, the commission and facilitation of tax evasion, smuggling, illegal immigration, and the illicit purchases of banks and real estate. The bank was found to have at least $10 billion in unaccounted funds.

From 1982 to 1991, Clifford served as chairman of First American Bankshares, which grew to become the largest bank in Washington, D.C. The bank was nominally owned by a group of Arab investors, but in order to assuage fears from the Federal Reserve, Clifford had assembled a board of distinguished American citizens to exercise day-to-day control. In 1991, Robert M. Morgenthau, the District Attorney for New York County (coterminous with the borough of Manhattan), disclosed that his office had found evidence that BCCI secretly owned First American. Morgenthau convened a grand jury to determine whether Clifford and his partner, Robert A. Altman, had deliberately misled federal regulators when the two men assured them that BCCI would have no outside control.

An audit by Price Waterhouse revealed that contrary to agreements between First American&#x27;s nominal investors and the Federal Reserve, many of the investors had borrowed heavily from BCCI. Even more seriously, they had pledged their First American stock as collateral. When they missed interest payments, BCCI took control of the shares. It was later estimated that in this manner, BCCI had ended up with 60 percent or more of First American&#x27;s stock. There had long been suspicions that First American&#x27;s investors were actually nominees for BCCI. However, the audit was solid confirmation that BCCI secretly—and illegally—owned First American.

Clifford&#x27;s predicament worsened when it was disclosed he had made about $6 million in profits from bank stock that he had bought with an unsecured loan from BCCI. The grand jury handed up indictments, and the U.S. Justice Department opened its own investigation. Clifford&#x27;s assets in New York City, where he kept most of his investments, were frozen.

Clifford insisted that he had no knowledge of illegal activity at First American, and insisted that he himself had been deceived about the extent of BCCI&#x27;s involvement. Using the support of Kamal Adham, both former president Robert A. Altman and former chairman Clifford were indicted on largely circumstantial evidence.

A &quot;Report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate&quot;, prepared by U.S. Senators John Kerry and Hank Brown, noted that a key strategy of &quot;BCCI&#x27;s successful secret acquisitions of U.S. banks in the face of regulatory suspicion was its aggressive use of a series of prominent Americans&quot;, Clifford among them. Clifford, who prided himself on decades of meticulously ethical conduct, summed his predicament up when he sadly told a reporter from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I have a choice of either seeming stupid or venal.&quot;

While Clifford maintained his innocence, he did face criminal charges of fraud, conspiracy, and taking bribes. These charges were dropped in 1993 because of Clifford’s ill health. In 1998, the year of his death, he and Altman reached a $5 million settlement with the Federal Reserve and settled the last of several civil lawsuits against them.

==Death==
Not long after a final, frail appearance in the 1997 PBS television documentary &quot;Truman&quot;, Clifford died on October 10, 1998, at the age of 91. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington County, Virginia.

==Legacy==

Clark Clifford emerged as a national figure almost overnight, moving from a low-level naval aide in the White House to President Truman&#x27;s top adviser and strategist. His success came from hard work, a good mind, poker skills to match those of his boss, the ability to stroke the press, the knack to immediately seize on serendipitous opportunities, and the ability to identify, reshape and promote good ideas first proposed by others, such as George Kennan. He thus gained fame for papers that he presented forcefully, but did not actually write, including his 1947 proposal on Truman&#x27;s reelection strategy and the Clifford-Elsey papers on Cold War strategy. He became a trusted advisor to presidential candidate John F. Kennedy in 1960, assuring his access by indicating he wanted no public office. His reputation – and his law practice – continued to soar until finally Lyndon Johnson appointed him Defense Secretary to lead the nation out of the Vietnam trap. Historian Walter Isaacson argues that in many ways Clifford resembled the four wise men who shaped American foreign policy in the 1940s and early 1950s – Dean Acheson, Averell Harriman, Robert A. Lovett, and John J. McCloy. However, Isaacson argues, &quot;Clifford remained a Wise Man wannabe because he could never quite shake his reputation as a partisan wheeler-dealer and manipulator.&quot;

In 1995, Tony Goldwyn portrayed Clifford in the HBO television film &quot;Truman&quot;. In 2002, Donald Sutherland portrayed Clifford in the HBO television film &quot;Path to War&quot;.

==Works==
In 1991, Clifford&#x27;s memoirs &quot;Counsel to the President&quot; (co-authored with Richard Holbrooke, later U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations) were published just as his name was implicated in the unfolding BCCI scandal.

<doc id="80225" wikidata="Q499056" url="?curid=80225" title="Melvin Laird">
<text>Melvin Robert Laird Jr. (September 1, 1922 – November 16, 2016) was an American politician, writer and statesman. He was a U.S. congressman from Wisconsin from 1953 to 1969 before serving as Secretary of Defense from 1969 to 1973 under President Richard Nixon. Laird was instrumental in forming the administration&#x27;s policy of withdrawing U.S. soldiers from the Vietnam War; he coined the expression &quot;Vietnamization,&quot; referring to the process of transferring more responsibility for combat to the South Vietnamese forces. First elected in 1952, Laird was the last living Representative elected to the 83rd Congress at the time of his death.

==Early life==
Melvin Robert Laird was born in Omaha, Nebraska, the son of Melvin R. Laird Sr., a politician, businessman, and clergyman. He grew up and attended high school in Marshfield, Wisconsin, although in his junior year he attended Lake Forest Academy in Lake Forest, Illinois. He was nicknamed &quot;Bambino&quot; (shortened to &quot;Bom&quot; and pronounced like the word &#x27;bomb&#x27;) by his mother.

Laird was the grandson of William D. Connor, the Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin from 1907 to 1909, and the great-grandson of Robert Connor, a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. His niece is Jessica Laird Doyle, wife of former Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle.

He graduated from Carleton College in Minnesota in May 1944, having enlisted in the United States Navy a year earlier. Following his commissioning as an ensign, he served on a destroyer, the , in the Pacific during the end of World War II. A recipient of the Purple Heart and several other decorations, Laird left the Navy in April 1946.

==Legislative career==
Laird entered the Wisconsin State Senate at age 23, succeeding his deceased father. He represented a legislative district encompassing Stevens Point, Wisconsin. He remained in the Senate until his election in November 1952 to the United States House of Representatives representing Wisconsin&#x27;s 7th District in central Wisconsin, including the areas of Marshfield, Wausau, Wisconsin Rapids and Stevens Point. In the 1964 Republican presidential primaries, Laird was an &quot;unannounced&quot; supporter of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, and chaired the Platform Committee at that year&#x27;s Republican convention, at which Goldwater was nominated.

Laird was re-elected eight consecutive times and he was chairman of the House Republican Conference when Nixon selected him for the cabinet. He was known for his work on both domestic and defense issues, including his service on the Defense subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. He left Congress reluctantly, making it clear when he became secretary on January 22, 1969, that he intended to serve no more than four years.

As a congressman Laird had supported a strong defense posture and had sometimes been critical of Secretary McNamara. In September 1966, characterizing himself as a member of the loyal opposition, he publicly charged the Johnson administration with deception about Vietnam war costs and for delaying decisions to escalate the ground war until after the 1966 congressional elections. Laird also criticized McNamara&#x27;s management and decision-making practices. Laird voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Laird was reportedly the elder statesman chosen by the Republicans to convince Vice President Spiro Agnew to resign his position after Agnew&#x27;s personal corruption became a public scandal. He also had a prominent role in the selection of Gerald Ford as Agnew&#x27;s successor as vice president.

==Secretary of Defense==
After he became Secretary of Defense, Laird and President Nixon appointed a Blue Ribbon Defense Panel that made more than 100 recommendations on DoD&#x27;s organization and functions in a report on July 1, 1970. The department implemented a number of the panel&#x27;s proposals while Laird served in the Pentagon.

===Managerial style===

Laird did not depart abruptly from the McNamara–Clifford management system, but rather instituted gradual changes. He pursued what he called &quot;participatory management&quot;, an approach calculated to gain the cooperation of the military leadership in reducing the Defense budget and the size of the military establishment. While retaining decision-making functions for himself and the deputy secretary of defense, Laird somewhat decentralized policymaking and operations. He accorded the service secretaries and the JCS a more influential role in the development of budgets and force levels. He revised the PPBS, including a return to the use of service budget ceilings and service programming of forces within these ceilings. The previously powerful systems analysis office could no longer initiate planning, only evaluate and review service proposals.

Laird noted this in his FY 1971 report, &quot;Except for the major policy decisions, I am striving to decentralize decisionmaking as much as possible ... So, we are placing primary responsibility for detailed force planning on the Joint Chiefs and the Services, and we are delegating to the Military Departments more responsibility to manage development and procurement programs.&quot; The military leadership was enthusiastic about Laird&#x27;s methods. As the Washington Post reported after his selection as secretary of defense, &quot;Around the military-industrial complex these days they&#x27;re singing &#x27;Praise the Laird and pass the transformation.&#x27;&quot;Laird did not shrink from centralized management where he found it useful or warranted. His tenure saw the establishment of the Defense Investigative Service, the Defense Mapping Agency, the Office of Net Assessment, and the Defense Security Assistance Agency (to administer all DoD military assistance programs). In October 1972 Congress passed legislation creating a second deputy secretary of defense position, a proposal Laird strongly supported, even though he never filled the position. Laird paid special attention to two important interdepartmental bodies: the Washington Special Action Group (WSAG), composed of senior Defense, State, and CIA officials, which gathered information necessary for presidential decisions on the crisis use of U.S. military forces; and the Defense Program Review Committee (DPRC), which brought together representatives from many agencies, including DoD, State, the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Office of Management and Budget, to analyze defense budget issues as a basis for advising the president, placing, as Laird commented, &quot;national security needs in proper relationship to non-defense requirements.&quot;

===Pentagon budget===
Laird succeeded in improving DoD&#x27;s standing with Congress. As a highly respected congressional veteran, Laird had a head start in his efforts to gain more legislative support for Defense programs. He maintained close contact with old congressional friends, and he spent many hours testifying before Senate and House committees. Recognizing the congressional determination, with wide public support, to cut defense costs (including winding down the Vietnam War), Laird worked hard to prune budgetary requests before they went to Congress, and acceded to additional cuts when they could be absorbed without serious harm to national security. One approach, which made it possible to proceed with such new strategic weapon systems as the B-1 bomber, the Trident nuclear submarine, and cruise missiles, was agreement to a substantial cut in conventional forces. As a result, total military personnel declined from some 3.5 million in FY 1969 to 2.3 million by the time Laird left office in January 1973. Those weapon platforms, as well as the F-15, F-16, A-10, and Los Angeles-class nuclear submarine were all programs started by the Laird Pentagon.

Other initiatives, including troop withdrawals from Vietnam, phasing out old weapon systems, base closures, and improved procurement practices, enabled the Pentagon to hold the line on spending, even at a time when high inflation affected both weapon and personnel costs. In Laird&#x27;s years, total obligational authority by fiscal year was as follows: 1969, $77.7 billion; 1970, $75.5 billion; 1971, $72.8 billion; 1972, $76.4 billion; and 1973, $78.9 billion.

===Vietnam War===

Vietnam preoccupied Laird as it had McNamara and Clifford. Right from the moment he entered office, Laird clashed with the National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger over access to the president. Kissinger as much as possible tried to exclude Laird from the decision-making process, in order to ensure he and he alone was the man advising the president on foreign affairs, which created much tension between him and Laird. Kissinger established a direct channel from the National Security Adviser&#x27;s office to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in an effort to isolate Laird from the decision-making process, which further increased the tension between the two men.

In 1968 Nixon campaigned on a platform critical of the Johnson administration&#x27;s handling of the war and promised to achieve &quot;peace with honor&quot;. Nixon&#x27;s strategy when he came into office in 1969 was to impose an armistice that would preserve South Vietnam, but at the same time owing to the unpopularity of the Vietnam War, he planned to reduce American casualties in Vietnam to reduce the appeal of the antiwar movement, whose most potent slogan was that Americans were dying senselessly in Vietnam. The North Vietnamese knew that the war was unpopular with the American people, and to counter the assumption in Hanoi that they merely had to wait until American public opinion forced him to withdraw American forces, Nixon planned a complex strategy of on one hand of maintaining military pressure by keeping the war going while on the other hand of reducing American casualties to counter the antiwar movement. To force the North Vietnamese to agree to American peace terms, Nixon planned a dual approach of the &quot;Madman theory&quot; that he would pose as a fanatical anti-Communist who was eager to use nuclear weapons to scare the North Vietnamese while at the same time he make overtures to the Soviet Union and China to persuade those nations to stop supplying North Vietnam with weapons.

Although not receptive to demands for immediate withdrawal, Laird acknowledged the necessity to disengage U.S. combat forces gradually. In an interview with Stanley Karnow in 1981, Laird stated that he came into the Defense Department in 1969 believing the American people were &quot;fed up with the war&quot;. Thus he developed and strongly supported &quot;Vietnamization&quot;, a program intended to expand, equip, and train South Vietnam&#x27;s forces and assign to them an ever-increasing combat role, at the same time steadily reducing the number of U.S. combat troops. The original term was &quot;de-Americanizing&quot; the war, but Laird substituted the term &quot;Vietnamization&quot; as it sounded better. In March 1969, Laird visited South Vietnam and upon his return to Washington told Nixon that the American people would &quot;not be satisfied with less than the eventual disengagement of American men from combat&quot;. As such, Laird felt it was &quot;essential to decide now to initiate the removal from Southeast Asia of some U.S. military personnel&quot;. Laird strongly pressed Nixon to agree to a timetable to decrease the number of American forces in South Vietnam down from half-million to two hundred and six thousand by the end of 1971. During Nixon&#x27;s first year in office from January 1969 to January 1970, about 10, 000 Americans were killed fighting in Vietnam. As these losses contributed to the antiwar movement, Laird ordered the U.S. commander in Vietnam, General Creighton Abrams, to go on the defensive and cease offensive operations as much as possible.

In February 1969, Nixon first discussed plans to start bombing Cambodia, ostensibly to destroy the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese bases in that country, but in fact to send a message to North Vietnam that he was prepared to resume the bombing of North Vietnam, that had been halted in the autumn of the previous year. Nixon would have very much liked to resume the bombing of North Vietnam, but he was warned by Laird that this would lead to the North Vietnamese ending the peace talks in Paris, which in turn would lead to Nixon being branded as the man who ruined any chance of peace in Vietnam. Thus, from Nixon&#x27;s viewpoint, bombing Cambodia was a way of warning the North Vietnamese that he was indeed serious about his threats to resume bombing North Vietnam if no concessions to the American viewpoint were not forthcoming. Laird was opposed to the bombing of Cambodia, telling Nixon that it would upset Congress and the American people as it would appear that Nixon was escalating the war. In a meeting at the White House on 16 March 1969 attended by Nixon, Laird, the Secretary of State William P. Rogers, Kissinger and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Earle Wheeler, Nixon announced that he had decided to start bombing Cambodia while at the same time not telling the American people that Cambodia was being bombed. The next day, Operation Menu as the bombing of Cambodia was code-named, started.

As Cambodia was a neutral nation, the bombing was kept secret and officially denied. Laird created a dual reporting system at the Pentagon so that the reports from bombing raids over Cambodia were not reported via the normal channels, with both the secretary of the air force and Air Force chief of staff being kept out of the loop. As North Vietnam professed to respect Cambodia&#x27;s neutrality, Hanoi did not protest against the American bombing of the North Vietnamese forces that were violating Cambodia&#x27;s neutrality. Laird told a few members of Congress that the United States was bombing Cambodia, but to the American people, it was denied in 1969 that Cambodia was being bombed. Several legal and constitutional experts were to subsequently testify that as Nixon did not inform the majority of Congress that he was bombing Cambodia, let alone ask for permission of Congress for the bombing, that this was illegal as the U.S. constitution gave Congress, not the president, the power to declare war. The bombing campaign against Cambodia which started in March 1969 and ended in August 1973, is considered by most legal experts to be an act of war which was waged without being sanctioned by Congress, making the bombing campaign to be a matter of questionable legality at best and downright illegal at worst.

Under the constitution, Congress has the control of the budget and the president can only ask Congress to appropriate money. Starting in 1969, Laird put the assumption that U.S. forces in Vietnam would be lower in the next fiscal year into the Defense Department&#x27;s budget request to Congress. Given that Nixon was a Republican and the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, passing a budget required much torturous negotiation. By putting the anticipated lower number of troops in Vietnam into the Pentagon&#x27;s budget request for the next fiscal year, Laird in effect tied Nixon&#x27;s hands as not to withdraw these troops would greatly upset relations with Congress and could potentially threaten the entire defense budget. Once Congress passed the budget, Nixon had to withdraw the troops as it would otherwise cause a major constitutional crisis that would as Karnow put it threaten &quot;...the defense establishment&#x27;s entire financial equilibrium&quot;. Karnow wrote that Laird&#x27;s &quot;...contribution to America&#x27;s departure from Vietnam has been underestimated&quot;.

Under the Johnson administration, the issue of American POWs in North Vietnam had been generally ignored out of the fear that signaling concern about their status would make them into hostages that could be used to extract concessions. The families of the Air Force and Navy pilots shot down over North Vietnam and taken prisoner found that the Pentagon was often savagely unsympathetic to their plight, taking the view that the best thing these families could do was to be silent. Starting in May 1969, Laird did his best to publicize the POW issue, launching on 3 May a &quot;Go Public&quot; campaign to draw attention to the mistreatment and torture of American POWs in North Vietnam. Laird believed in drawing attention to the POW issue for humanitarian reasons, but officials such as Vice President Spiro Agnew saw the issue more as a way of mobilizing public support for Nixon&#x27;s Vietnam policy. Agnew calculated that the American people did not care much for South Vietnam, but that presenting the war as a struggle to free American POWs being mistreated in North Vietnam would increase public support for the war.

Laird often clashed with Kissinger in 1969 over the correct policy to follow in Vietnam. Kissinger argued to Nixon that the continued presence of American soldiers in South Vietnam &quot;remains one of our few bargaining weapons&quot; and that to start withdrawing forces from Vietnam would become &quot;like salted peanuts&quot; to the American people as &quot;the more U.S troops come home, the more will be demanded&quot;. Kissinger still believed if only North Vietnam was bombed hard enough, then concessions could still be won as he maintained: &quot;I can&#x27;t believe that a fourth-rate power like North Vietnam doesn&#x27;t have a breaking point&quot;. By contrast, Laird argued to Nixon that a steady reduction in U.S. forces from Vietnam was the best way of ensuring his re-election in 1972. Before 1969, Kissinger was a professor of political science at Harvard University whereas Laird had been a Republican Congressman. Owing to these very different backgrounds, Laird was considerably more sensitive to American public opinion while Kissinger belonged more to the traditional &quot;Primat der Aussenpolitik&quot; school which saw foreign policy as belonging only to a small elite.

In the summer of 1969, Laird told the press that Vietnamization was the Nixon administration&#x27;s &quot;highest priority&quot; while also stating that the U.S. troops in South Vietnam were moving from &quot;maximum pressure&quot; to &quot;protective reaction&quot;. In September 1969, when Kissinger drafted Duck Hook, a plan which in his own words called for a &quot;savage, punishing blow&quot; against North Vietnam in the form of renewed bombing, Laird persuaded Nixon to reject the plan. Laird argued to the president that Kissinger&#x27;s &quot;savage&quot; bombing plan would kill a massive number of innocent North Vietnamese civilians and thus increase popular support for the anti-war movement. At the same time, Laird doubted that Kissinger&#x27;s plans for a &quot;savage&quot; bombing of North Vietnam would yield the desired results and predicated that it would cause the North Vietnamese to break off the peace talks going on in Paris. For all these political reasons, Laird was able to convince Nixon not to go ahead with Kissinger&#x27;s plans for a &quot;savage&quot; bombing offensive.

During 1969 the new administration cut authorized U.S. troop strength in Vietnam from 549,500 to 484,000, and by May 1, 1972, the number stood at 69,000. During this same period, from January 1969 to May 1972, U.S. combat deaths declined 95 percent from the 1968 peak and war expenditures fell by about two-thirds. Laird publicized Vietnamization widely; in his final report as secretary of defense in early 1973, he stated: &quot;Vietnamization ... today is virtually completed. As a consequence of the success of the military aspects of Vietnamization, the South Vietnamese people today, in my view, are fully capable of providing for their own in-country security against the North Vietnamese.&quot;

On 15 October 1969, the first Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam demonstration took place, and one of those protesting was John Laird, the son of the Defense Secretary. At the time, the younger Laird told the press &quot;I think everybody should be against the war&quot;, though he also praised his father for &quot;doing the best job I think he possibly can&quot;. John Laird&#x27;s participation in the Moratorium march attracted much media attention who chose to spin it as a generational battle, in the same way that Robert Craig McNamara had publicly criticized his father Robert McNamara when he was Defense Secretary, though John Laird expressed much admiration for his father even as he stated his opposition to the war. Later that day on 15 October, Nixon asked Laird to stay behind at a meeting of the National Security Council. Both Nixon and Kissinger criticized him for his &quot;softness&quot;, saying he should have found a way to silence his son. Laird replied &quot;that&#x27;s the way John felt and I supported him&quot;. Nixon&#x27;s statement that Laird was a poor father who should have found a way to &quot;muzzle&quot; his son angered him so much that the president never criticized him on that point again.

However, Laird helped to contribute ideas for Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Silent Majority speech&quot; of 3 November 1969, where the president asked for the support of the &quot;silent majority&quot; of Americans for his Vietnam policy. During the second Moratorium protest on 15 November 1969, Laird asked two of his more hawkish officials, the Navy Secretary John Chafee and his undersecretary John Warner to go &quot;undercover&quot; with the demonstrators. Both Chafee and Warner came back to Laird saying the demonstrators were far from the conservative caricature of anti-social drug-crazed, sex-obsessed hippies intent upon destroying everything good in the United States, saying the demonstrators were thoughtful and patriotic young people who just thought the Vietnam War was misguided. Laird later recalled: &quot;They were a little shaken because I don&#x27;t think they realized the extent of some of the feelings of those young people. That&#x27;s what I was tying to get them to understand. But I couldn&#x27;t get the White House to understand that&quot;. Laird believed that America by late 1969 was becoming a dangerously polarized society and it was the best interests to have hawks who despised the anti-war movement to try to understand the young people demonstrating against the war on the streets of Washington.

In October 1969, at the urging of Laird, the American Red Cross began &quot;Write Hanoi&quot; campaign, urging the American people to send letters to POWs. In November 1969, at Laird&#x27;s instigation, the lead story in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; was about the POWs together with detachable Christmas cards to be mailed to North Vietnam. At the same time, Laird recruited an eccentric Texas millionaire, H. Ross Perot, to start a fundraising campaign to send Christmas presents to the POWs languishing in the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot; prison. Though the North Vietnamese refused to allow the presents to be delivered, the resulting story gave maximum publicity to the POW issue as Laird had hoped it would. Perot caused an international incident in December 1969 when he flew to Moscow together with the Christmas presents and tried to book a flight to Hanoi. As intended, the refusal to allow Perot to go to Hanoi made the North Vietnamese look cruel and mean and increased support for Nixon&#x27;s policies. Laird&#x27;s &quot;Go Public&quot; campaign did lead to an improvement in the conditions for American POWs from mid-1969 onward as stories of Americans being tortured increased support for hawkish policies in the United States and thus led the North Vietnamese to improve conditions to assist the dovish section of American opinion.

In this same report Laird noted that the war had commanded more of his attention than any other concern during his four-year term. Upon becoming secretary he set up a special advisory group of DoD officials, known as the Vietnam Task Force, and he met with them almost every morning he was in the Pentagon. He also visited Vietnam several times for on-the-scene evaluations. Although his program of Vietnamization could be termed a success, if one considers the progress of troop withdrawals, U.S. involvement in the conflict became perhaps even more disruptive at home during Nixon&#x27;s presidency than during Johnson&#x27;s. The U.S. incursion into Cambodia in May 1970 to eliminate North Vietnamese sanctuaries, the renewed bombing of North Vietnam and the mining of its harbors in May 1972 in response to the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive and another bombing campaign against the North in December 1972 brought widespread protest. Nixon&#x27;s Vietnam policy, as well as that of previous administrations, suffered further criticism when, in June 1971, the Pentagon Papers, a highly classified narrative and documentary history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967, prepared at Secretary McNamara&#x27;s order, was leaked and published in part in several major newspapers.

On the night of 21 February 1970, as a secret counterpart to the official peace talks in Paris, Kissinger met the North Vietnamese diplomat Lê Đức Thọ in a modest house located in an undistinguished industrial suburb of Paris, largely as a way of excluding the South Vietnamese from the peace talks as Kissinger had discovered that the South Vietnamese president Nguyễn Văn Thiệu had a vested interest in ensuring the peace talks failed and that the United States should not withdraw from Vietnam. Reflecting his disdain for both Laird and Rogers, Kissinger did not see fit until a year later in February 1971 to first inform the Defense Secretary and the Secretary of State that he had been talking with Thọ in Paris off and on for the last year. Laird publicly supported Nixon&#x27;s Vietnam course, although Laird privately opposed the deception used to mask the Cambodian bombing from the American populace.

In early 1970, Laird was opposed to Nixon&#x27;s plans to invade Cambodia. Nixon as part of his &quot;madman theory&quot; believed if he behaved as a rash leader capable of any action such as invading Cambodia that would show North Vietnam that &quot;we were still serious about our commitment in Vietnam&quot;, and thus intimidate the North Vietnamese into a making peace on American terms. Additionally, General Abrams was arguing to Washington that the troop withdrawals of 1969 had undermined the American position in South Vietnam, and to regain control of the situation required destroying the COSVN (Central Office for South Vietnam), the supposed headquarters of the Viet Cong, said to be located just over the border in Cambodia. Once Laird learned that the president was determined to go ahead, he reconciled himself to invading Cambodia, though he tried to minimize the operation by having it limited to the South Vietnamese forces with their American advisers invade the Parrot&#x27;s Beak area of Cambodia. Nixon rejected Laird&#x27;s recommendation as he later put it as &quot;the most pusillanimous little nitpicker I ever saw&quot;. Nixon decided instead on the evening of 26 April 1970 to &quot;go for broke&quot; with the &quot;entire package&quot; by having U.S. troops invade both the Parrot&#x27;s Beak and the Fish Hook areas of Cambodia that bordered South Vietnam. On 28 April 1970, South Vietnamese forces entered Cambodia starting the Cambodian Campaign and on the evening of 30 April 1970, Nixon went on national television to announce that the &quot;incursion&quot; into Cambodia had started with 20, 000 American and South Vietnamese troops entering Cambodia. The operation was successful in the sense that the Americans and South Vietnamese occupied the Fish Hook and Parrot&#x27;s Beak areas, but the majority of the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces had withdrawn in the previous weeks, and were to return after the Americans and South Vietnamese withdrew from Cambodia in June 1970.

The new Cambodian leader Lon Nol had supported the Cambodian &quot;incursion&quot; through he had not been consulted in advance, and as a result, the North Vietnamese increased their support for the Khmer Rouge guerrillas who were fighting to overthrow him. As Laird had warned, the United States now had the responsibility of supporting not only the South Vietnamese government, but also the Cambodian government as well in their struggle against Communist guerrillas. The Cambodian &quot;incursion&quot; set off massive protests in the United States, as Karnow wrote that the &quot;biggest protests to date&quot; against the war took place all across the nation in May 1970 as it seemed to many Americans that Nixon was recklessly escalating the war by invading Cambodia. Nixon as part of his &quot;madman theory&quot; liked to portray himself to the world as a reckless, dangerous leader capable of anything, but as Laird noted most of the American people wanted their president to be a statesman, not a &quot;madman&quot;. Many Republican politicians complained to Nixon from May 1970 that his policies on Vietnam would hurt their chances for the congressional elections in November 1970, leading Nixon to comment to Kissinger &quot;when the Right starts wanting go get out, for whatever reason, that&#x27;s &quot;our&quot; problem&quot;. In an address on national television aired on 7 October 1970, Nixon changed tactics as he toned down his rhetoric as he stressed his interest in peace, saying he would pull out 90,000 American soldiers from South Vietnam by the spring of 1971 and wanted an immediate ceasefire. The speech on 7 October was the beginning of a remodeling of Nixon&#x27;s image from being Nixon the &quot;madman&quot; president over to Nixon the statesman president.

In 1970, Laird approved of planning for a commando raid on a North Vietnamese POW camp at Son Tay. On 24 September 1970, he asked for Nixon&#x27;s approval, which was granted. On 19 November 1970, the camp was raided, but there were no POWs present, having been moved to another camp in July. At a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the raid, Laird testified: &quot;I could not ignore the fact that our men were dying in captivity. Mr. Chairman, I want this committee to know that I have not faced a more challenging decision since I have been Secretary of Defense&quot;.

In October 1970, Laird approved of an increase in bombing along the section of the Ho Chi Minh Trail running through neutral Laos. The bombing hindered, but did not stop the supply of weapons and men going down from North Vietnam to South Vietnam, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed that the United States invade Laos to sever the trail once and for all. Since the Cooper–Church Amendment passed by Congress in December 1970 forbade American troops from fighting in Laos, this plan was illegal, but fearing that Nixon would approve it anyway, Laird preemptively proposed that South Vietnamese troops invade Laos with American air support. On 23 December 1970, Nixon approved of the plan, and in January 1971, Laird went to Saigon to persuade the South Vietnamese president Thiệu to approve it as well. The plan for the invasion of Laos was named Operation Lam Son 719 after a famous victory won the Vietnamese over the Chinese in 1427. On 8 February 1971, South Vietnam invaded Laos. To assist the South Vietnamese who proved incapable of taking the town of Tchepone, Laird approved of the largest helicopter assault of the entire Vietnam war. On 6 March 1971, 276 American helicopters took two battalions of South Vietnamese infantry into Laos. Unlike the invasion of Cambodia the previous year, the invasion of Laos caused few protests in the United States mostly because Lam Son was perceived as a South Vietnamese operation, not an American one, which for Laird was a sign of the success of Vietnamization.

In June 1971, the Pentagon Papers, as a secret history of the Vietnam War was informally known, started to be serially published by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, after having been leaked by Daniel Ellsberg. Nixon was enraged by the leaking of the Pentagon Papers, and went to court to force the &quot;New York Times&quot; to stop publishing the papers under the grounds that national security was threatened. After failing to persuade Nixon that trying to ban the Pentagon Papers was unwise, Laird changed tack. Laird secretly informed the Solicitor General, Erwin Griswold, who was prosecuting the &quot;New York Times&quot; for threatening national security, that there were only &quot;six or seven paragraphs in the whole thing that were a little dangerous&quot; and those paragraphs had already been published. As Griswold had not read the Pentagon Papers in their entirety, he needed advice from the Defense Department about just what precisely was in the 2.5 million words that made up the papers that were allegedly threatening the national security of the United States. Griswold agreed with Laird, and when arguing for the president before the Supreme Court he undermined his own case by saying the list of material to be banned was &quot;much too broad&quot;. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the &quot;New York Times&quot; on 30 June 1971, stating the publication of the Pentagon Papers did not threaten national security, and the next day the &quot;Times&quot; resumed publishing the Pentagon Papers. As Laird predicted, the attempt to ban the Pentagon Papers drew far more public attention to their contents than would have otherwise been the case.

In December 1971, the Third Indo-Pakistani war broke out, and the United States despite being neutral was as Kissinger put it &quot;tilted&quot; towards Pakistan, doing everything within its power short of intervention to support Pakistan. Laird was dubious about the plans to support Pakistan, the weaker of the two powers, all the more so as the Soviet Union was supporting India, which would thus make Pakistan&#x27;s inevitable defeat look like a defeat for the United States as well. The fact that the West Pakistani-dominated government of Pakistan led by General Yahya Khan was waging a genocidal campaign against the Hindu minority in East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh) made Pakistan a morally repugnant ally as well, but Nixon and Kissinger both greatly valued Yahya Khan&#x27;s help as a &quot;honest broker&quot; who served as the back channel to China. Nixon, sensing Laird&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm for Pakistan, ordered Kissinger on 6 December 1971 to get Laird to &quot;follow the White House line&quot;.

A bizarre aftermath to the crisis occurred when the columnist Jack Anderson in his &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Around&quot; column broke the news on 13 December 1971 of the &quot;tilt&quot;, which led to an investigation of who had leaked the news. A Navy stenographer, Charles Radford, was accused of leaking the information; Radford denied leaking, but admitted that he stole documents from Kissinger on orders of Admiral Robert Welander who passed on the documents to Admiral Thomas Hinman Moorer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The commander of the Navy, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, summed up the scene by late 1971: &quot;Kissinger telling me that he distrusted Haig; Haig telling me and others that he distrusted Kissinger; Haldeman/Ehrlichman trying to bushwack Kissinger; Kissinger and the President using Moorer to help them make plans without Laird&#x27;s knowledge and therefore pretending to keep Moorer fully informed while withholding some information from him...What I find hard to believe is that rational men could think running things like that could have any other result other than &quot;leaks&quot; and spying, an all round paranoia. Indeed, they had created a system in which &quot;leaks&quot; and &quot;spying&quot; were everyday and essential elements&quot;. Laird did not fire Radford as Kissinger demanded while Admiral Moorer was given a verbal dressing-down for unprofessional conduct. Laird felt that firing Moorer as Kissinger wanted would resulted in the atmosphere of fear and distrust in the Nixon administration being made public as undoubtedly the sacked admiral would have leaked the reasons for his dismissal to the press. By this point, the entire atmosphere in the Nixon administration of intrigue and paranoia was becoming too much for Laird. 
Laird counted on the success of Vietnamization, peace talks that had begun in 1968 in Paris and the secret negotiations in Paris between Kissinger and North Vietnamese representatives to end the conflict. On 27 January 1973, two days before Laird left office, the negotiators signed the Paris Peace Accords. They agreed to an in-place cease-fire to begin on 28 January 1973, complete withdrawal of U.S. forces within 60 days, the concurrent phased release of U.S. prisoners of war in North Vietnam, and establishment of the International Commission of Control and Supervision to handle disagreements among the signatories. Although, as time was to demonstrate, South Vietnam was not really capable of defending its independence, Laird retired from office satisfied that he had accomplished his major objective, the disengagement of United States combat forces from Vietnam.

===Cold War and nuclear war planning===
Vietnam preoccupied Laird, but not to the exclusion of other pressing matters. Although not intimately involved in the development of strategic nuclear policy as McNamara had been, Laird subscribed to the Nixon administration&#x27;s program of &quot;Strategic Sufficiency&quot; – that the United States should have the capability to deter nuclear attacks against its home territory and that of its allies by convincing a potential aggressor that he would suffer an unacceptable level of retaliatory damage; it should also have enough nuclear forces to eliminate possible coercion of its allies. The policy, not much different from McNamara&#x27;s except in name and phrasing, embraced the need both to avoid mass destruction of civilians and to seek mechanisms to prevent escalation of a nuclear conflict. The administration further refined its strategic ideas in July 1969 when the president issued a statement that came to be known as the &quot;Nixon Doctrine&quot;, stressing &quot;pursuit of peace through partnership with our allies.&quot; Instead of the previous administration&#x27;s &quot;2½ war&quot; concept – readiness to fight simultaneous wars on two major fronts and one minor front – the Nixon Doctrine cut back to the &quot;1½ war&quot; level. Through military aid and credit-assisted sales of military equipment abroad, the United States would prepare its allies to take up a greater share of the defense burden, especially manpower needs, in case of war. U.S. military forces would be &quot;smaller, more mobile, and more efficient general purpose forces that ... [would] neither cast the United States in the role of world policeman nor force the nation into a new isolationism.&quot; Laird supported the strategic arms talks leading to the SALT I agreements with the Soviet Union in 1972: a five-year moratorium against expansion of strategic nuclear delivery systems, and an antiballistic missile treaty limiting each side to two sites (later cut to one) for deployed ABM systems. As Laird put it, &quot;In terms of United States strategic objectives, SALT I improved our deterrent posture, braked the rapid buildup of Soviet strategic forces, and permitted us to continue those programs which are essential to maintaining the sufficiency of our long-term strategic nuclear deterrent.&quot;

===Conscription suspended===
Other important Laird goals were ending conscription by June 30, 1973, and the creation of an All Volunteer Force (AVF). Strong opposition to selective service mounted during the Vietnam War and draft calls declined progressively during Laird&#x27;s years at the Pentagon; from 300,000 in his first year, to 200,000 in the second, 100,000 in the third, and 50,000 in the fourth. On January 27, 1973, after the signing of the Vietnam agreement in Paris, Laird suspended the draft, five months ahead of schedule.

==Later career==
Laird completed his term of office as secretary of defense on January 29, 1973. Because he had stated repeatedly that he would serve only four years (only Charles Erwin Wilson and Robert McNamara among his predecessors served longer), it came as no surprise when President Nixon on November 28, 1972, nominated Elliot Richardson to succeed him. In his final report in January 1973, Laird listed what he considered to be the major accomplishments of his tenure: Vietnamization; achieving the goal of strategic sufficiency; effective burden-sharing between the United States and its friends and allies; adequate security assistance; maintenance of U.S. technological superiority through development of systems such as the B-1, Trident and cruise missiles; improved procurement; &quot;People Programs&quot; such as ending the draft and creating the AVF; improved National Guard and Reserve forces; enhanced operational readiness; and participatory management. One of Laird&#x27;s most active initiatives was his persistent effort to secure the release of the American captives held by the enemy in Vietnam.

During his tenure as Defense Secretary, Laird did not share President Nixon&#x27;s lingering timetable for withdrawal from Vietnam. He publicly contradicted the administrations policy, which upset the White House. Laird wished to return to the political arena, and was said to be planning a run for president in 1976. After Watergate, this proved implausible. There was also talk of a Senate run and perhaps a return to his old House seat in hopes of becoming Speaker.
In spite of Vietnam and the unfolding Watergate affair, which threatened to discredit the entire Nixon administration, Laird retired with his reputation intact. Although not a close confidant of the president and not the dominant presence that McNamara was, Laird had been an influential secretary. He achieved a smooth association with the military leadership by restoring some of the responsibilities they had lost during the 1960s. His excellent relations with Congress enabled him to gain approval for many of his programs and budget requests.

After a brief absence, Laird returned to the Nixon administration in June 1973 as counselor to the president for domestic affairs, concerning himself mainly with legislative issues. In February 1974, as the Watergate crisis in the White House deepened, Laird resigned to become senior counselor for national and international affairs for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Following Richard Nixon&#x27;s resignation, Laird was reported to be the first choice of successor Gerald Ford to be nominated vice president, a position ultimately filled by Nelson Rockefeller.

In 1974, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Since 1974, he wrote widely for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and other publications on national and international topics.

Laird was quietly opposed to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and tried to use his influence together with that of the former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to persuade President George W. Bush not to invade Iraq. In November 2005, Laird published an article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; that was highly critical of the Bush administration&#x27;s handling of the Iraq war, though Laird advised against an immediate pull-out from Iraq as that would cause more chaos. Laird advised a strategy of Iraqization along the same lines as Vietnamization, arguing that the American people would not tolerate endless war in Iraq anymore than they did in Vietnam. Laird argued that as long the American forces were doing the majority of the fighting in Vietnam, the South Vietnamese government had no reason to try to improve its military, and it was only in 1969 when the South Vietnamese were informed that the United States was pulling out in stages that the South Vietnamese finally became serious by trying to make its military actually fight. He argued that the same strategy of Iraqization was needed, stating that as long as the American forces were doing the bulk of the fighting in Iraq that the Iraqi government had no reason to try to improve its military. Laird criticized human rights abuses, writing: &quot;For me, the alleged prison scandals reported to have occurred in Iraq, in Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay have been a disturbing reminder of the mistreatment of our own POWs by North Vietnam&quot;. He argued that retaining U.S. moral leadership would require that the &quot;war on terror&quot; be conducted with the standard humanitarian norms of the West and that the use of torture was a disgrace. About President Bush, Laird wrote: &quot;His west Texas cowboy approach – shoot first and answer questions later, or do the job first and let the results speak for themselves – is not working&quot;. Laird&#x27;s article attracted much media attention, all the more because he was a Republican and former Defense Secretary who had been a mentor to Donald Rumsfeld.

On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the White House of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials. Laird was disappointed by the meeting, which was a photo-op, as neither he nor the others present were allowed much time to speak, with the bulk of the conference consisting of video calls from servicemen in Iraq. In 2007, Laird came close to endorsing the presidential bid of his former intern, Hillary Clinton, saying in an interview that she had been one of his best interns and that he felt certain she would make an excellent president.

In 2008, journalist Dale Van Atta published a biography of Laird entitled &quot;With Honor: Melvin Laird in War, Peace, and Politics&quot;, published by University of Wisconsin Press.

==Role in health care research==
Laird played a key role in advancing medical research, although this part of his biography is often overshadowed by his political achievements.
&quot;Laird&#x27;s position on the House Appropriations subcommittee handling health matters allowed him to play a key congressional role on many medical and health issues. He often teamed up with liberal Democrat John Fogarty of Rhode Island to pass key legislation on education or health matters. Their impact on the National Institutes of Health was pivotal in a vast expansion of health research programs and facilities. They also sponsored the buildup of the National Library of Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, the National Environmental Center in North Carolina, and the nation&#x27;s eight National Cancer Centers, later part of the National Institutes of Health. Laird received many awards for his work on health matters, including the Albert Lasker Medical Research Award (1964) and the American Public Health Association award for leadership.&quot; This account of his role is noted in the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library biography.

Between 1956 and 1967, Laird was appointed a member of the U.S. Delegation to the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, by three U.S. Presidents – Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.

In fact, President Eisenhower so admired Laird&#x27;s work in Congress for world health and national security that he described Congressman Laird as &quot;one of the 10 men best qualified to become President of the United States.&quot;

Laird&#x27;s interest in medical research is documented by his co-authoring legislation to finance the construction of the National Library of Medicine, and important centers for medical research on many university campuses (among them the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research and the University of Wisconsin Cancer Center in Madison) and the major institutes of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Laird, Congressman Fogarty and Senator Lister Hill (D-Alabama) also authorized legislation which funded the building of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) in Atlanta, GA.

==Death and legacy==
Following the death of Clarence Clifton Young on April 3, 2016, Laird became the last surviving member of the 83rd Congress, as well as the last surviving member elected in either the 1952 or 1954 elections. Laird died of congestive heart failure in Fort Myers, Florida on November 16, 2016, at the age of 94.

Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said in a statement: &quot;Secretary Laird led the Defense Department through a time of great change in the world and within our department. Through it all, he demonstrated an unfailing commitment to protecting our country, strengthening our military, and making a better world.&quot;

&quot;Those of us who fought and those of us held prisoner in Vietnam will always have a special place in our hearts for Sec Melvin Laird,&quot; tweeted Senator John McCain, after learning of Laird&#x27;s death.

The Laird Center for Medical Research (dedicated in 1997), located in Marshfield, Wisconsin is named after him. It is a medical research and education facility on the campus of Marshfield Clinic.

On May 19, 2017, the Department of Defense ordered the following. ALCON, 1. IN ACCORDANCE WITH REF A, AS A MARK OF RESPECT FOR THE INTERMENT OF FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MELVIN LAIRD, THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO BE FLOWN AT HALF-STAFF ON FRIDAY MAY 19, 2017. 2. THE FLAG SHALL BE FLOWN AT HALF-STAFF ON ALL DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS, MILITARY POSTS AND NAVAL STATIONS, AND NAVAL VESSELS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. RELEASED BY: CDR H. MOHLER, DOD EXECUTIVE SECRETARY

Laird was buried in Arlington National Cemetery (Section 34).

<text>Lou Tellegen (born Isidor Louis Bernard Edmon van Dommelen; November 26, 1881 or 1883 – October 29, 1934) was a Dutch-born stage and film actor, film director and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Lou Tellegen was born as Isidor Louis Bernard Edmon van Dommelen in Sint-Oedenrode, the illegitimate child of a separated, but not divorced, lieutenant of the West-Indian Army Isidore Louis Bernard Edmon Tellegen (1836–1902) and his partner Anna Maria van Dommelen (1844–1917), widow of Eduard Hendrik Jan Storm van &#x27;s Gravezande.

He made his stage debut in Amsterdam in 1903, and over the next few years built a reputation to the point where he was invited to perform in Paris, eventually co-starring in several roles with Sarah Bernhardt, with whom he was involved romantically. In 1910, he made his motion picture debut alongside Bernhardt in &quot;La dame aux camélias&quot;, a silent film made in France and based on the play by Alexandre Dumas, fils.

==Career==

In 1910, Tellegen and Bernhardt travelled to the United States, where &quot;The New York Times&quot; first published, and then retracted, the announcement of their impending marriage. (She was 39 years his senior.) Back in France, in 1912 they made their second film together, &quot;Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth&quot; (&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;), and the following year, &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot;. The latter is considered a lost film.

In the summer of 1913, Tellegen went to London where he produced and starred in a play based on Oscar Wilde&#x27;s novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. Invited back to the United States, Tellegen worked in theatre and made his first American film in 1915, titled &quot;The Explorer&quot;, followed by &quot;The Unknown&quot;, both with Dorothy Davenport as his co-star. Considered one of the best-looking actors on screen, he followed up with three straight films starring alongside Geraldine Farrar.
==Personal life==
Tellegen married a total of four times, first to a sculptor in 1903 (this union produced a daughter), and second to Farrar in 1916. His marriage to Farrar ended in divorce in 1923. His third marriage was to actress Nina Romano (real name: Isabel Craven Dilworth), with whom he had a son. His fourth marriage was to silent film star Eve Casanova (real name Julia Horne). He became an American citizen in 1918.

On December 25, 1929, Tellegen sustained burns to his face when he fell asleep while smoking. At the time, he was preparing for an out-of-town tryout for a play. To repair the damage, Tellegen underwent extensive plastic surgery. 

==Later career and death==
In 1931, he wrote his autobiography &quot;Women Have Been Kind&quot;.

By 1931, Tellegen’s popularity had declined and he had trouble securing acting work. He was also deeply in debt and filed for bankruptcy. Around this time, Tellegen was diagnosed with cancer, though this information was kept from him. Tellegen soon grew despondent.

On October 29, 1934, while a guest of Edna Cudahy, the widow of meat packing heir Jack Cudahy, at the Cudahy Mansion at 1844 North Vine Street in Hollywood (now the site of the Vine-Franklin underpass of the Hollywood Freeway), Tellegen locked himself in the bathroom, then shaved and powdered his face. While standing in front of a full-length mirror, he stabbed himself in the heart seven times with a pair of sewing scissors. Some accounts claim Tellegen was surrounded by newspaper clippings of his career at the time of his suicide.

When asked to comment on Tellegen&#x27;s death former wife Geraldine Farrar replied &quot;Why should that interest me?&quot; Tellegen was cremated and his remains were scattered at sea.

<text>A commando is a combatant, or operative of an elite light infantry or special operations force, specially trained for carrying out raids and operating in small teams behind enemy lines.

Originally &quot;a commando&quot; was a type of combat unit, as opposed to an individual in that unit. In other languages, &quot;commando&quot; and &quot;kommando&quot; denote a &quot;command&quot;, including the sense of a military or an elite special operations unit. In the militaries and governments of most countries, commandos are distinctive in that they specialize in unconventional assault on high-value targets.

In English, to distinguish between an individual commando and a commando unit, the unit is occasionally capitalized.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;commando&quot; originally derives from the Latin word &quot;commendare&quot; (&quot;to recommend&quot;) via the Dutch word &quot;kommando&quot;, which translates as &quot;a command or order&quot; and or roughly to &quot;mobile infantry unit&quot;. &quot;Kommando&quot; in turn originated from the Portuguese word &quot;comando&quot;, which used in Portuguese India to refer to an early type of special forces. The word was adopted into Afrikaans from Boer interactions with the Portuguese in neighboring African colonies. In Southern Africa, the term originally referred to units of locally raised mounted infantry which fought during the Xhosa Wars, Anglo-Zulu War and the First and Second Boer Wars. The British were exposed to the concept during the 19th and 20th centuries, in particular during the Boer Wars. During World War II, the British military established the Commandos, a formation of special forces units which engaged in raids againsts German-occupied Europe. &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; special forces units were also referred to as &quot;kommandos&quot;. Some historians have argued the term is a High German loan word originating from German colonists who settled in the Dutch Cape Colony.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; ties the English use of the word meaning &quot;[a] member of a body of picked men ...&quot; directly into its Afrikaans&#x27; origins:
 During World War II, newspaper reports of the deeds of &quot;the commandos&quot; only in the plural led to readers thinking that the singular meant one man rather than one military unit, and this new usage became established.

== Selection ==
Due to the special mental and physiological requirements made of the applicants, there are restrictions entering &quot;commando&quot; units. Applicants have to fulfil special requirements. Selecting applicants with the highest motivation, modern special forces run special selection processes.

Historically there is evidence of selection for the &quot;Otdelnly Gwardieskij Batalion Minerow,&quot; predecessors of the modern Russian spetsnaz. Soldiers had to be younger than 30 years, were mostly athletes or hunters and had to show the highest motivation. During training and selection some participants died since they were exhausted and left to their devices.

The German Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK) demands from their applicants high levels of physical resilience, teamwork, willingness to learn, mental resilience, willpower, sense of responsibility, flexibility, secrecy and adaptation. These skills are proved during assessment.

The fitness test of the U.S. Navy SEALs tests swimming speed over 500 yards, number of push-ups and sit-ups within 2 minutes, pull-ups and running 1.5 miles.

Long Range Desert Group hired their personnel after a very long interrogation. First SAS members had to complete a march of 50km, and the Royal Marine commandos tested their applicants&#x27; motivation during an obstacle course using real explosives and machine gun fire close to Achnacary in Scotland. The French Foreign Legion assesses their applicants through medical, intelligence, logic, and fitness tests as well as interrogations, small drills and solving small tasks. 

Commando soldiers are supposed to think independently. This is unusual in the context of most military training, but is necessary for work in small groups and avoiding enemies&#x27; reconnaissance.

== Boer name origin and adoption by Britain ==
After the Dutch Cape Colony was established in 1652, the word was used to describe bands of militia. The first &quot;Commando Law&quot; was instated by the original Dutch East India Company chartered settlements and similar laws were maintained through the independent Boer Orange Free State and South African Republic. The law compelled burghers to equip themselves with horses and firearms when required in defense. The implementation of these laws was called the &quot;Commando System&quot;. A group of mounted militiamen was organized in a unit known as a &quot;commando&quot; and headed by a commandant, who was normally elected from inside the unit. Men called up to serve were said to be &quot;on commando&quot;. British experience with this system led to the widespread adoption of the word &quot;commandeer&quot; into English in the 1880s.

During the Great Trek, conflicts with Southern African peoples such as the Xhosa and the Zulu caused the Boers to retain the commando system despite being free of colonial laws. Also, the word became used to describe any armed raid. During this period, the Boers also developed guerrilla techniques for use against numerically superior but less mobile bands of natives such as the Zulu, who fought in large, complex formations.

In the First Boer War, Boer commandos utilised superior marksmanship, fieldcraft, camouflage and mobility to great effect against British forces, who wore conspicuous red uniforms and were poorly trained in marksmanship. These tactics continued to be used during the Second Boer War. In the final phase of the war, 25,000 Boer commandos engaged in asymmetric warfare against British Imperial forces numbering 450,000 strong for two years after the British had captured the capitals of the two Boer republics. During these conflicts the word entered the English language, retaining its general Afrikaans meaning of a &quot;militia unit&quot; or a &quot;raid&quot;. Robert Baden-Powell recognised the importance of fieldcraft and was inspired to form the scouting movement.

In 1941, Lieutenant-Colonel D. W. Clarke of the British Imperial General Staff, suggested the name &quot;commando&quot; for specialized raiding units of the British Army Special Service in evocation of the effectiveness and tactics of the Boer commandos. During World War II, American and British publications, confused over the use of the plural &quot;commandos&quot; for that type of British military units, gave rise to the modern common habit of using &quot;a commando&quot; to mean one member of such a unit, or one man engaged on a raiding-type operation.

== Green berets and training ==
Since the 20th century and World War II in particular, commandos have been set apart from other military units by virtue of their extreme training regimes; these are usually associated with the awarding of green berets which originated with British Commandos. The British Commandos were instrumental in founding many other international commando units during World War II. Some international commando units were formed from members who served as part of or alongside British Commandos, such as the Dutch Korps Commandotroepen (who still wear the recognition flash insignia of the British Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife), the Belgian 5th Special Air Service, or Greek Sacred Band. In 1944 the SAS Brigade was formed from the British 1st and 2nd SAS, the French 3rd and 4th SAS, and the Belgian 5th SAS. The French Army special forces (1er RPIMa) still use the motto &quot;Qui Ose Gagne&quot;, a translation of the SAS motto &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;.

In addition, many Commonwealth nations were part of the original British Commando units. They developed their own national traditions, including the Australian Special Air Service Regiment, the New Zealand Special Air Service, and the Rhodesian Special Air Service, all of whom share (or used to) the same insignia and motto as their British counterparts. During the Second World War, the British SAS quickly adopted sand-coloured berets, since they were almost entirely based in the North African theatre; they used these rather than green berets to distinguish themselves from other British Commando units. (See History of the Special Air Service). Other Commonwealth commando units were formed after the Second World War directly based on the British Commando units, such as the Australian Army Reserve 1st Commando Regiment (Australia), distinct from the Regular Army 2nd Commando Regiment (Australia), who originated from the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment in 1997 .

The US Rangers were founded by Major General Lucian Truscott of the US Army, a liaison officer with the British General Staff. In 1942, he submitted a proposal to General George Marshall that an American unit be set up &quot;along the lines of the British Commandos&quot;. The original US Rangers trained at the British Commandos centre at Achnacarry Castle. The US Navy SEALs&#x27; original formation, the Observer Group, was also trained and influenced by British Commandos. The US Special Forces originated with the First Special Service Force, formed under British Combined Operations. The First Special Service Force was a joint American-Canadian unit and modern Canadian special operations forces also trace their lineage to this unit and through it to British Commandos, despite existing in their modern incarnation only since 2006.

Malaysian green beret special forces PASKAL and Grup Gerak Khas (who still wear the Blue Lanyard of the Royal Marines) were originally trained by British Commandos. The Portuguese Marine Corps Fuzileiros were originally trained by British Commandos in 1961. Other British units, such as the SAS, led to the development of many international special operations units that are now typically referred to as commandos, including the Bangladeshi Para-Commando Brigade, Pakistani Special Services Group, the Indian MARCOS, Jordanian Special Operation Forces and Philippine National Police Special Action Force.

A Dutch study found that a sampling of Dutch male special forces operators were more emotionally stable, conscientious, but also more closed minded than matched civilian controls and other types of soldiers.

== World War I ==

===Austro-Hungarian assault units===

During the winter of 1914–1915 large parts of the Eastern Front switched to trench warfare. To cope with the new situation many Austro-Hungarian regiments spontaneously formed infantry squads called &quot;Jagdkommandos&quot;. These squads were named after the specially trained forces of Russian army formed in 1886 and were used to protect against ambushes, to perform reconnaissance and for low intensity fights in no-man&#x27;s-land.

Austro-Hungarian High army command (&quot;Armeeoberkommando&quot;, AOK) realized the need for special forces and decided to draw on German experience. Starting in September–October 1916 about 120 officers and 300 NCOs were trained in the German training area in Beuville (near the village of Doncourt) to be the main cadre of the newly raised Austro-Hungarian army assault battalions. The former &quot;Jagdkommandos&quot; were incorporated into these battalions.

=== Italy ===

The first country to establish commando troops was Italy, in the summer 1917, shortly before Germany.

Italy used specialist trench-raiding teams to break the stalemate of static fighting against Austria-Hungary, in the Alpine battles of World War I. These teams were called &quot;Arditi&quot; (meaning &quot;daring, brave ones&quot;); they were almost always men under 25 in top physical condition and, possibly at first, bachelors (due to fear of very high casualty rates). Actually the Arditi (who were led to the lines just a few hours before the assault, having been familiarised with the terrain via photo-reconnaissance and trained on trench systems re-created ad hoc for them) suffered fewer casualties than regular line infantry and were highly successful in their tasks. Many volunteered for extreme-right formations in the turbulent years after the war and (the Fascist Party took pride in this and adopted the style and the mannerism of Arditi), but some of left-wing political persuasions created the &quot;Arditi del Popolo&quot; (People&#x27;s Arditi) and for some years held the fascist raids in check, defending Socialist and Communist Party sections, buildings, rallies and meeting places.

== World War II ==
=== Australia ===

The Australian Army formed commando units, known as Australian independent companies in the early stages of World War II. They first saw action in early 1942 during the Japanese assault on New Ireland, and in the Battle of Timor. Part of the 2/1st Independent Company was wiped out on New Ireland, but on Timor, the 2/2nd Independent Company formed the heart of an Allied force that engaged Japanese forces in a guerrilla campaign. The Japanese commander on the island drew parallels with the Boer War, and decided that it would require a 10:1 numerical advantage to defeat the Allies. The campaign occupied the attention of an entire Japanese division for almost a year. The independent companies were later renamed commando squadrons, and they saw widespread action in the South West Pacific Area, especially in New Guinea and Borneo. In 1943, all the commando squadrons except the 2/2nd and 2/8th were grouped into the 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/9th Cavalry Commando Regiments.

Later in the war the Royal Australian Navy also formed commando units along the lines of the Royal Naval Commandos to go ashore with the first waves of major amphibious assaults, to signpost the beaches and carry out other naval tasks. These were known as RAN Commandos. Four were formed—lettered A, B, C and D like their British counterparts—and they took part in the Borneo campaign.

Z Force, an Australian-British-New Zealand military intelligence commando unit, formed by the Australian Services Reconnaissance Department, also carried out many raiding and reconnaissance operations in the South West Pacific theatre, most notably Operation Jaywick, in which they destroyed tonnes of Japanese shipping at Singapore Harbour. An attempt to replicate this success, with Operation Rimau, resulted in the death of almost all those involved. However, Z Force and other SRD units continued operations until the war&#x27;s end.

=== Canada ===
A joint Canadian-American Commando unit, the 1st Special Service Force, nicknamed the Devil&#x27;s Brigade, was formed in 1942 under the command of Colonel Robert Frederick. The unit initially saw service in the Pacific, in August 1943 at Kiska in the Aleutians campaign. However most of its operations occurred during the Italian campaign and in southern France. Its most famous raid, which was documented in the film &quot;Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot;, was the battle of Monte la Difensa. In 1945, the unit was disbanded; some of the Canadian members were sent to the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion as replacements, and the American members were sent to either the 101st Airborne Division or the 82nd Airborne Division as replacements or the 474th Regimental Combat Team. Ironically they were sent to serve in Norway in 1945, the country they were formed to raid.

===Finland===
The Finns fielded the Erillinen Pataljoona 4 and about 150 men were trained before the beginning of summer 1941. At first, the units had as few as 15 men, but during the war this was increased to 60. On July 1, 1943, the units were organised in the 4th Detached Battalion. In 1944, a special unit with amphibious He 115 planes was founded to support the battalion. The total strength of the battalion was 678 men and 76 women (see Lotta Svärd).

In the Battle of Ilomantsi, soldiers of the 4th disrupted the supply lines of the Soviet artillery, preventing effective fire support. The battalion made over 50 missions in 1943 and just under 100 in 1944, and was disbanded on November 30 of that same year.

Sissiosasto/5.D is another Finnish Commando unit of the World War Two era. The Detachment was founded on August 20, 1941, under the Lynx Division (5th Division, Finnish VI Corps). It was a self-contained unit for reconnaissance patrolling, sabotage and guerrilla warfare operations behind enemy lines.

=== Germany ===
In December 1939, following the success of German infiltration and sabotage operations in the Polish campaign, the German Office for Foreign and Counter-Intelligence (OKW Amt Ausland/Abwehr) formed the Brandenburger Regiment (known officially as the 800th Special Purpose Training and Construction Company). The Brandenburgers conducted a mixture of covert and conventional operations but became increasingly involved in ordinary infantry actions and were eventually converted into a Panzer-Grenadier Division, suffering heavy losses in Russia. Otto Skorzeny (most famed for his rescue of Benito Mussolini) conducted many special operations for Adolf Hitler. Skorzeny commanded Sonderlehrgang z.b.V. Oranienburg, Sonderverband z.b.V. Friedenthal, and SS-Jäger-Bataillon 502, 500th SS Parachute Battalion, SS-Jagdverband Mitte and all other SS commando units.

The German Fallschirmjäger were famous for their elite skills and their use in rapid commando style raids and as elite &quot;fire brigade&quot; infantrymen. Fort Eben-Emael on the Belgian border was captured in 1940 by Fallschirmjäger troops as part of the German invasion and occupation of Belgium.

A report written by Major-General Robert Laycock in 1947 claimed that there was a German raid on a radar station on the Isle of Wight in 1941.

=== Greece ===

The Sacred band () was a Greek special forces unit formed in 1942 in the Middle East, composed entirely of Greek officers and officer cadets under the command of Col. Christodoulos Tsigantes. It fought alongside the SAS in the Libyan Desert and with the SBS in the Aegean, as well as with General Leclerc&#x27;s &quot;Free French Forces&quot; in Tunisia. It was disbanded in August 1945.

=== Italy ===
Italy&#x27;s most renowned commando unit of World War II was &quot;Decima Flottiglia MAS&quot; (&quot;10th Assault Vehicle Flotilla&quot;), which, from mid-1940, sank or damaged a considerable tonnage of Allied ships in the Mediterranean.

After Italy surrendered in 1943, some of the &quot;Decima Flottiglia MAS&quot; were on the Allied side of the battle line and fought with the Allies, renaming themselves the &quot;Mariassalto&quot;. The others fought on the German side and kept their original name but did not operate at sea after 1943, being mostly employed against Italian partisans; some of its men were involved in atrocities against civilians.

In post-war years the Italian marine commandos were re-organised as the &quot;Comsubin&quot; (an abbreviation of &quot;Comando Subacqueo Incursori&quot;, or Underwater Raiders Command). They wear the green Commando beret.

=== Japan ===
In 1944–45, Japanese &quot;Teishin Shudan&quot; (&quot;Raiding Group&quot;) and &quot;Giretsu&quot; (&quot;heroic&quot;) detachments made airborne assaults on Allied airfields in the Philippines, Marianas and Okinawa. The attacking forces varied in size from a few paratroopers to several companies. Due to the balance of forces concerned, these raids achieved little in the way of damage or casualties, and resulted in the destruction of the Japanese units concerned. Considering that there were no plans to extract these forces, and the reluctance to surrender by Japanese personnel during that era, they are often seen in the same light as &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots of 1944–45.

Nakano School trained intelligence and commando officers and organized commando teams for sabotage and guerrilla warfare.

The navy had commando units &quot;S-toku&quot; (Submarine special attack units, see Kure 101st JSNLF(in Japanese) ) for infiltrating enemy areas by submarine. It was called the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces of Kure 101st, Sasebo 101st and 102nd.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand formed the Southern Independent Commando in Fiji 1942.

=== Poland ===

Cichociemni (; the &quot;Silent Unseen&quot;) were elite special-operations paratroopers of the Polish Army in exile, created in Great Britain during World War II to operate in occupied Poland (&quot;Cichociemni Spadochroniarze Armii Krajowej&quot;).

=== Soviet Union ===
Voyennaya Razvyedka (Razvedchiki Scouts) are &quot;Military intelligence&quot; personnel/units within larger formations in ground troops, airborne troops and marines. Intelligence battalion in the division, reconnaissance company in the brigade, a reconnaissance platoon in the regiment.

Soviet Naval Frogmen
The legendary Soviet Naval Scout Viktor Leonov commanded an elite unit of Naval Commandos. The 4th Special Volunteer Detachment was a unit of 70 veterans. Initially they were confined to performing small scale reconnaissance missions, platoon sized insertions by sea and on occasion on land into Finland and later Norway. Later they were renamed the 181st Special Reconnaissance Detachment. They began conducting sabotage missions and raids to snatch prisoners for interrogation. They would also destroy German ammunition and supply depots, communication centers, and harass enemy troop concentrations along the Finnish and Russian coasts. After the European conflict ended, Leonov and his men were sent to the Pacific theatre to conduct operations against the Japanese.

=== United Kingdom ===

In 1940, the British Army formed &quot;independent companies&quot;, later reformed as battalion sized &quot;commandos&quot;, thereby reviving the word. The British intended that their commandos be small, highly mobile surprise raiding and military reconnaissance forces. They intended them to carry all they needed and not remain in field operations for more than 36 hours. Army Commandos were all volunteers selected from existing soldiers still in Britain.

During the war the British Army Commandos spawned several other famous British units such as the Special Air Service, the Special Boat Service and the Parachute Regiment. The British Army Commandos themselves were never regimented and were disbanded at the end of the war.

The Special Operations Executive (SOE) also formed commando units from British and displaced European personnel (e.g., Cichociemni) to conduct raiding operations in occupied Europe. They also worked in small teams, such as the SAS, which was composed of ten or fewer commandos because that was better for special operations. One example is Norwegian Independent Company 1, which destroyed heavy water facilities in Norway in 1941.

The Royal Navy also controlled Royal Navy Beach Parties, based on teams formed to control the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940. These were later known simply as RN Commandos, and they did not see action until they successfully fought for control of the landing beaches (as in the disastrous Dieppe Raid of 19 August 1942). The RN Commandos, including Commando &quot;W&quot; from the Royal Canadian Navy, saw action on D-Day.

In 1942, the Royal Navy&#x27;s nine Royal Marines infantry battalions were reorganized as Commandos, numbered from 40 to 48, joining the British Army Commandos in combined Commando Brigades. After the war the Army Commandos were disbanded. The Royal Marines form an enduring Brigade-strength capability as 3 Commando Brigade with supporting Army units.

The Royal Air Force also formed 15 commando units in 1942, each of which was 150 strong. These units consisted of trained technicians, armourers and maintainers who had volunteered to undertake the commando course. These Royal Air Force Commandos accompanied the Allied invasion forces in all theatres; their main role was to allow the forward operation of friendly fighters by servicing and arming them from captured air fields. However, due to the forward position of these airfields, the RAF Commandos were also trained to secure and make safe these airfields and to help defend them from enemy counterattack.

=== United States ===
During 1941, the United States Marine Corps formed commando battalions. The USMC commandos were known collectively as Marine Raiders. On orders from President Franklin D. Roosevelt through a proposal from OSS Director Colonel William J. Donovan and the former Commander of the United States Marine Detachment Major Evans F Carlson, directed the formation of what became the Marine Raiders. Initially this unit was to be called Marine Commandos and were to be the counterpart to the British Commandos. The name Marine Commandos met with much controversy within the Marine Corps leading Commandant Thomas J. Holcomb to state, &quot;the term &#x27;Marine&#x27; is sufficient to indicate a man ready for duty at any time, and the injection of a special name, such as &quot;commando&quot;, would be undesirable and superfluous.&quot; President Roosevelt&#x27;s son James Roosevelt served with the Marine Raiders. The Raiders initially saw action at the Battle of Tulagi and the Battle of Makin, as well as the Battle of Guadalcanal, the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, and other parts of the Pacific Ocean Areas. In February 1944 the four Raider battalions were converted to regular Marine units. Additionally, as parachuting special forces units, Paramarines arguably also qualified as commandos- though they too were assimilated into regular Marine units in 1944.

In mid-1942, the United States Army formed its Army Rangers in Northern Ireland under William O. (Bill) Darby. The Rangers were designed along the similar lines to the British Commandos. The first sizable Ranger action took place in August 1942 at the Dieppe Raid, where 50 Rangers from the 1st Ranger Battalion were dispersed among Canadian regulars and British Commandos. The first full Ranger action took place in November 1942 during the invasion of Algiers in Northwest Africa in Operation Torch, again by members of the 1st Ranger Battalion.

=== Israeli ===

The primary commando units of the Israel Defense Forces include Shayetet 13, Sayeret Matkal, and the Shaldag Unit, as well as the Oz Brigade (which contains the subordinate commando units Duvdevan Unit, Egoz Reconnaissance Unit, and Maglan).

Shayetet 13 is the elite naval commando unit of the Israeli Navy. S&#x27;13 specializes in sea-to-land incursions, counter-terrorism, sabotage, maritime intelligence gathering, maritime hostage rescue, and boarding. The unit is one of the world&#x27;s most well reputed special forces units.

Sayeret Matkal (General Staff Reconnaissance Unit) is a special forces unit of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) directly subordinate to the Directorate of Military Intelligence. Primarily a field intelligence-gathering unit specializing in special reconnaissance behind enemy lines, Sayeret Matkal is also tasked with counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, and foreign espionage. Modeled after the British Army&#x27;s Special Air Service—from which it emulated the motto, &quot;Who Dares, Wins&quot;—the unit is considered to be the Israeli equivalent to the famed Delta Force of the United States. As one of Israel&#x27;s most important commando units, the Sayeret Matkal has reputedly been involved in almost every major counter-terrorism operation since its inception in 1957.

The Egoz Reconnaissance Unit is an Israeli Special Force commando unit, in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Egoz is a unit that specializes in guerrilla, anti-guerrilla warfare, behind enemy lines intelligence gathering, and more complicated ground activity. Egoz is part of the Commando Brigade but still completes basic training with the Golani Brigade.

Maglan (Also known as Unit 212) is an Israeli special forces unit which specializes in operating behind enemy lines and deep in enemy territory using advanced technologies and weaponry.

Unit 217, frequently called Duvdevan Unit is an elite special operations force within the Israel Defense Forces, part of the Oz Brigade. Duvdevan are noted for undercover operations in urban areas, during which they often wear Arab civilian clothes as a disguise.

Shaldag Unit, also known as Unit 5101, is an elite Israeli Air Force commando unit. Shaldag&#x27;s mission is to deploy undetected into combat and hostile environments to conduct special reconnaissance, establish assault zones or airfields, while simultaneously conducting air traffic control and commando actions.
=== Philippines ===

The Special Action Force (SAF) is the elite commando unit of the Philippine National Police. It is required to undergo the SAF Commando Course to be allowed to wear the SAF Beret. It also serves as the foundation course or requisite for other SAF specialization trainings such as Explosives and Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Basic Airborne Course (BAC), Urban Counter Revolutionary Warfare Course (SURESHOCK), SCUBA-BUSROC (Basic Under-Water Search and Rescue Operations Course), SAF Seaborne Warfare Course (SSWC) and others.

=== UK ===
3 Commando Brigade, Royal Marines is under the command of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Commander-in-Chief Fleet. All Royal Marines (other than those in the Royal Marines Band Service) are commando trained on entry to the Corps, with supporting units and individuals from the other armed services undertaking the All Arms Commando Course as required.

The Brigade is made up of 30 (IX) Commando, 40 Commando (home base: Taunton), 42 Commando (Bickleigh, South Hams, Plymouth), 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group (HMNB Clyde, Argyll and Bute), 45 Commando (Arbroath, Scotland), the Commando Logistic Regiment, the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group (Bovington Camp (Royal Armoured Corps Centre), Dorset), 539 Assault Squadron RM, 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery and 24 Commando Regiment Royal Engineers.

The Royal Marines is the largest force of its type in Europe and the second largest in NATO.

=== US ===

The United States continues to have no designated &quot;commando&quot; units; however, the closest equivalents remain the U.S. Army&#x27;s 75th Ranger Regiment and United States Marine Corps Reconnaissance Battalions, which specialize in most of the same tasks and missions. 

During the Vietnam War the U.S. Army&#x27;s 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) instituted, &quot;Special Operations Augmentation Recondo School,&quot; an acronym for Reconnaissance Commando. The school was at Nha Trang Air Base, north of the massive U.S. Navy and Air Force Base at Cam Ranh Bay. Recondo School trained small, heavily armed long-range reconnaissance teams the art of patrolling deep in enemy-held territory. All students were combat veterans and came from the ranks of the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps Force Recon Battalions, and the Army of the Republic of South Korea. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam had their own school. The modern U.S. Army&#x27;s Long-range surveillance (LRS), Reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA), and United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance all derive some portion of their legacies from the Recondo program and utilize the name &quot;Recondos&quot; informally.

<doc id="80230" wikidata="Q815240" url="?curid=80230" title="Clothes hanger">
<text>A clothes hanger, coat hanger, or coathanger, or simply a hanger, is a hanging device in the shape/contour of:
* Human shoulders designed to facilitate the hanging of a coat, jacket, sweater, shirt, blouse or dress in a manner that prevents wrinkles, with a lower bar for the hanging of trousers or skirts.
* Clamp for the hanging of trousers, skirts, or kilts. Both types can be combined in a single hanger.

The clothing hanger was originally designed to allow people quick access to their clothing as well as designate an area, in their home, to keep their clothing in. It was also used to keep clothing dry or without a wrinkle.

There are three basic types of clothes hangers. The first is the wire hanger, which has a simple loop of wire, most often steel, in a flattened triangle shape that continues into a hook at the top. The second is the wooden hanger, which consists of a flat piece of wood cut into a boomerang-like shape with the edges sanded down to prevent damage to the clothing, and a hook, usually of metal, protruding from the point. Some wooden hangers have a rounded bar from tip to tip, forming a flattened triangle. This bar is designed to hang the trousers belonging to the jacket. The third kind and most used in today&#x27;s world are plastic coat hangers, which mostly mimic the shape of either a wire or a wooden hanger. Plastic coat hangers are also produced in smaller sizes to accommodate the shapes of children&#x27;s clothes.

Some hangers have clips along the bottom for suspending skirts. Dedicated skirt and trousers hangers may not use the triangular shape at all, instead using just a rod with clips. Other hangers have little rings coming from the top two bars to hang straps from tank-tops on. Specialized pant hanger racks may accommodate many pairs of trousers. Foldable clothes hangers that are designed to be inserted through the collar area for ease of use and the reduction of stretching are an old, yet potentially useful variation on traditional clothes hangers. They have been patented over 200 times in the U.S. alone, as in U.S. Patent 0586456, awarded in 1897 to George E. Hideout.

==History==

Referred to as a &quot;coat-hanger&quot;, the small piece of fabric attached to the nape of the neck inside a coat or jacket was developed in 1830, enabling the hanging of such types of outer clothing. Around 1850, small chains were developed to be used in place of fabric loops, though the use of loops of fabric continued, and are still a feature present in many garments today.

US President Thomas Jefferson was known to have a device for hanging clothes in his closet at Monticello. However, today&#x27;s most-used hanger, the shoulder-shaped wire hanger, was inspired by a coat hook that was invented in 1869 by O. A. North of New Britain, Connecticut. An employee of the Timberlake Wire and Novelty Company, Albert J. Parkhouse of Jackson, Michigan has also been credited with the invention. The story goes that one morning in 1903, Parkhouse arrived to work to find that all coat hooks were taken. Annoyed, he took a piece of wire, bent it into the shape we would recognize today, and hung his coat. Also credited is Christopher Cann in 1876 as an engineering student at Boston University.

In 1906 Meyer May, a men&#x27;s clothier of Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first retailer to display his wares on his wishbone-inspired hangers. Some of these original hangers can be seen at the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Meyer May House in Grand Rapids.

In 1932 Schuyler C. Hulett patented an improved design, which used cardboard tubes mounted on the upper and lower parts of the wire to prevent wrinkles, and in 1935 Elmer D. Rogers added a tube on the lower bar, which is still used.

Hangers can be made in wood, wire, plastic, rarely from a rubber substance and other materials. Some are padded with fine materials, such as satin, for expensive clothes, lingerie and fancy dresses. The soft, plush padding is intended to protect garments from shoulder dents that wire hangers may make. A caped hanger is an inexpensive wire clothing hanger covered in paper. Caped hangers are used by dry cleaners to protect garments after cleaning. Used wire hangers may be recycled, or returned to the dry cleaner.

The development of travel hangers, which are designed to provide a compact solution for travelers who require a simple, lightweight and foldable hanger that can accommodate their clothing needs, was a natural progression in the evolution of hangers. These hangers have been specifically designed with the traveler in mind, with their folding design allowing users to wrap their clothing around the hanger, making it easier to pack and store in their luggage.

This evolution has not only focused on their functionality and design but also on their environmental impact. The use of recycled plastics is one way in which hangers can be more sustainable. The production of hangers from recycled materials reduces waste, conserves energy and resources, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. This development is a natural progression in the evolution of hangers, aligning with global efforts to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainability.
==Unintended uses==

The wire is versatile, and wire clothes hangers are often used as cheap sources of semi-tough wire, more available than baling wire for all sorts of home projects. The use of wire clothes hangers for use as makeshift welding rod has been common for nearly 100 years. Similarly, many similar do-it-yourself and children&#x27;s projects use wire hangers as holders of various types, from keeping a brake caliper from hanging by the brake line during auto repair work to securing a gate on a birdcage. The much-loved &#x27;Advent crown&#x27; made for children&#x27;s TV program &quot;Blue Peter&quot; was made from four-wire coathangers. Coathangers can be used to make dowsing rods. After sanding, wire hangers also find uses as conducting wire for uses as varied as hot-wiring cars to games to testing hand steadiness. They are commonly used to gain forcible entry into older automobiles whose locks and entry systems are not protected from such methods. There is a long history of using wire coat hangers as replacement car radio antennas. Clothes hangers are also commonly used as an implement for roasting marshmallows or hot dogs at camp-outs.
&quot;Collecticus&quot; magazine reported in October 2007 that clothes hangers have now become collectible, especially those with a famous company or event advertised across the front. For example, a 1950 Butlins hanger sold for £10.10 in October 2006 within &quot;Collecticus&quot;.

In 1995, while performing surgery in an airliner at , orthopedic surgeon Angus Wallace and his fellow doctor Tom Wong used an unfolded coathanger, sterilised with brandy, as a trocar to stiffen a catheter for use as a chest tube to relieve a passenger&#x27;s pneumothorax.

Straightened-out wire clothes hangers have been used to perform unsafe and/or illegal abortions (frequently self-induced) by inserting the wire through the cervix and into the uterus, in order to cause the uterus to expel its contents. This life-threatening method poses severe risks to the person on whom it is performed. At pro-choice protests, wire clothes hangers have been used as symbols of the danger of criminalizing elective abortion.

<doc id="80248" wikidata="Q2635276" url="?curid=80248" title="Time immemorial">
<text>Time immemorial () is a phrase meaning time extending beyond the reach of memory, record, or tradition, indefinitely ancient, &quot;ancient beyond memory or record&quot;. The phrase is used in legally significant contexts as well as in common parlance.

== In law ==
In law, time immemorial denotes &quot;a period of time beyond which legal memory cannot go&quot;, and &quot;time out of mind&quot;. Most frequently, the phrase &quot;time immemorial&quot; appears as a legal term of art in judicial discussion of common law development and, in the United States, the property rights of Native Americans.

=== English and American common law ===
&quot;Time immemorial&quot; is frequently used to describe the time required for a custom to mature into common law. Medieval historian Richard Barber describes this as &quot;the watershed between a primarily oral culture and a world where writing was paramount&quot;. Common law is a body of law identified by judges in judicial proceedings, rather than created by the legislature. Judges determine the common law by pinpointing the legal principles consistently reiterated in previous legal cases over a long period of time.

In English law, time immemorial ends and legal memory begins at 1189, the end of the reign of King Henry II, who is associated with the invention of the English common law. Because common law is found to have a non-historical, &quot;immemorial&quot; advent, it is distinct from laws created by monarchs or legislative bodies on a fixed date. In English law, &quot;time immemorial&quot; has also been used to specify the time required to establish a prescriptive right. The Prescription Act 1832, which noted that the full expression was &quot;time immemorial, or time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary&quot;, replaced the burden of proving &quot;time immemorial&quot; for the enjoyment of particular land rights with statutory fixed time periods of up to 60 years.

American law inherited the English common law tradition. Unlike English law, American law does not set &quot;time immemorial&quot;, and American courts vary in their demands to establish &quot;immemoriality&quot; for the purposes of common law. In &quot;Knowles v. Dow,&quot; a New Hampshire court found that a regular usage for twenty years, unexplained and uncontradicted, is sufficient to warrant a jury in finding the existence of an immemorial custom. More often than not, however, American courts identify common law without any reference to the phrase &quot;time immemorial&quot;.

=== US federal Indian law ===

==== Water rights ====
&quot;Time Immemorial&quot; is sometimes used to describe the priority date of water rights holders. In the western United States, water rights are administered under the doctrine of prior appropriation. Under prior appropriation, water rights are acquired by making a beneficial use of water. Water rights that are acquired earlier are senior, and have priority over later, junior water rights during water shortages due to drought or over-appropriation. Generally, the priority date of water rights held by Native American tribes, also called &quot;Winters&quot; rights, is the date the tribe&#x27;s reservation was established. However, courts occasionally find that the tribe&#x27;s water rights carry a &quot;time immemorial&quot; priority date, the most senior date conceivable, for aboriginal uses of water on reserved land that overlaps with the tribe&#x27;s aboriginal land. For example, in &quot;U.S. v. Adair,&quot; the court reasoned that the Klamath Tribe necessarily had water rights with a priority date of &quot;time immemorial&quot; because they had lived and used the waters in Central Oregon and Northern California for more than a thousand uninterrupted years prior to entering a treaty with the United States in 1864.

==== Aboriginal title ====
When claiming or finding aboriginal title, the land rights Native Americans possess over the lands they have continuously and exclusively occupied for a long time prior to the intrusion of other occupants, plaintiff tribes and courts sometimes describe their occupancy as dating back to &quot;time immemorial&quot;.

==== Oral tradition evidence ====
Historically, American judges lacked confidence in the use of Native American oral traditional evidence, oral histories shared between past and present generations, in court. Since the &quot;Pueblo de Zia&quot; decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims in 1964, oral traditional evidence has received increased judicial endorsement. In affirming the use of Native American oral traditional evidence to establish title to land, the &quot;Pueblo de Zia&quot; court described the testimony as having been handed down between tribal council members from &quot;time immemorial&quot;.

<text>Charles Hutchins Hapgood (May 17, 1904 – December 21, 1982) was an American college professor and author who became one of the best known advocates of the pseudo-scientific claim of a rapid and recent pole shift with catastrophic results.

==Biography==
Hapgood was the son of Hutchins Hapgood and Neith Boyce. Hapgood received a master&#x27;s degree from Harvard University in 1929 in medieval and modern History. His Ph.D. work on the French Revolution was interrupted by the Great Depression. He taught for a year in Vermont and directed a community center in Provincetown, also serving as the executive secretary of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Crafts Commission.

During World War II, Hapgood was employed by the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI, which became the Office of Strategic Services in 1942) and the Red Cross, and also served as a liaison officer between the White House and the Office of the Secretary of the War. After the war, Hapgood taught at Keystone College (1945–1947), Springfield College (1947–1952), Keene State College (1956–1966) and New England College (1966–1967), lecturing in world and American history, anthropology, economics, and the history of science.

Hapgood married Tamsin Hughes in 1941 and divorced in 1955. He was struck by a motorist in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and died on December 21, 1982.

==Polar shift==

While at Springfield College, a student&#x27;s question about the Lost Continent of Mu prompted a class project to investigate the lost continent of Atlantis, leading Hapgood to investigate possible ways that massive earth changes could occur and exposing him to the literature of Hugh Auchincloss Brown.

In 1958, Hapgood published &quot;The Earth&#x27;s Shifting Crust&quot;. It denied the existence of continental drift, an idea that became supported by mainstream science a few years later. The book included a foreword by Albert Einstein. In &quot;Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Path of the Pole&quot; (1970), Hapgood proposed the hypothesis that the Earth&#x27;s axis has shifted numerous times during geological history. &quot;The Path of the Pole&quot; was meant as a replacement for &quot;The Earth&#x27;s Shifting Crust&quot; after corrections were suggested to him. Hapgood writes in &quot;Voices of Spirit&quot; (1975): &quot;In later discussions we discussed the theories of my book &#x27;Earth&#x27;s Shifting Crust&#x27;, and he [Einstein] suggested that one of them was wrong; as a result of this I revised my book, which subsequently was republished as &#x27;The Path of the Pole&#x27;. My own further research confirmed the truth of his observation, which involved technicalities of geophysics.&quot;

In &quot;Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings&quot; he supported the suggestion made by Arlington Mallery that a part of the Piri Reis map was a depiction of the area of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. He used that to propose that a 15° pole shift occurred around 9,600 BC (approx. 11,600 years ago) and that a part of the Antarctic was ice-free at that time and that an ice-age civilization could have mapped the coast. He concludes that &quot;Antarctica was mapped when these parts were free of ice&quot; and took the view that an Antarctic warm period coincided with the last ice age in the Northern hemisphere and that the Piri Reis and other maps were based on &quot;ancient&quot; maps derived from ice-age originals.

Later research concerning the paleoclimatology and ice sheets of Antarctica have discredited the interpretations by Hapgood that an Antarctic warm period coincided with the last glacial period in the Northern Hemisphere and that any part of it had been ice-free at and prior to 9,600 BC (approx. 11,600 years ago).

Hapgood also examined a 1531 map by French mathematician and cartographer Oronce Finé (aka &quot;Oronteus Finaeus&quot;). In &quot;Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings&quot;, he reproduces letters that he states he received from the chief of a U.S. Air Force cartography section stationed at Westover AFB in 1961. These letters say that at Hapgood&#x27;s request, they had studied both Piri Reis and Oronce Finé maps during their off-duty hours, concluding that both were compiled from original source maps of Antarctica at a time when it was relatively free of ice, supporting Hapgood&#x27;s findings. Hapgood concluded that advanced cartographic knowledge appears on the Piri Reis map and the Oronteus Finaeus map, and must be the result of some unknown ancient civilization that developed advanced scientific knowledge before other civilizations such as Greece.

According to historians Paul Hoye and Paul Lunde, while Hapgood&#x27;s work garnered some enthusiasm and praise for its thoroughness, his revolutionary hypotheses largely met with skepticism and were ignored by most scholars. In the book &quot;The Piri Reis Map of 1513&quot; Gregory C. McIntosh examines Hapgood&#x27;s claims for both maps and states that &quot;they fall short of proving or even strongly suggesting that the Piri Reis map and the Fine map depict the actual outline of Antarctica.&quot;

Hapgood&#x27;s ideas on catastrophe have been presented in other works by librarians Rose and Rand Flem-Ath and author and former journalist Graham Hancock, each basing portions of their works on Hapgood&#x27;s evidence for catastrophe at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. Hapgood&#x27;s ideas also figure prominently in the 2009 sci-fi/disaster movie &quot;2012.&quot;

==Acámbaro figures==
Hapgood and Erle Stanley Gardner thought the collection of clay artifacts known as the Acámbaro figures were created thousands of years ago. The date estimate as well as the notion the artifacts were made by some undiscovered culture was rejected by archeologists and paleontologists. The figurines, which most archaeologists dismiss as an elaborate hoax, depict oddities such as non-avian dinosaurs coexisting with men and horned humans.

==Elwood Babbitt==
Hapgood spent ten years working with New England medium Elwood Babbitt (1921-2001), attempting to make contact with notable figures from the past. Babbitt, a retired carpenter and World War II veteran, had studied trance mediumship at Edgar Cayce&#x27;s Association for Research and Enlightenment. Hapgood audiotaped and transcribed a number of Babbitt&#x27;s &quot;trance lectures&quot; which purported to come from Jesus, Albert Einstein, Mark Twain, and the Hindu god Vishnu, using the material to publish his final three books:&quot;Voices of Spirit, Through the Psychic Experience of Elwood Babbitt&quot; (1975), &quot;Talks with Christ and His Teachers Through the Psychic Gift of Elwood Babbitt&quot; (1981), and &quot;The God Within: a Testament of Vishnu, a Handbook for the Spiritual Renaissance&quot; (1982).
 During this time Babbitt and Hapgood&#x27;s cousin, Beth Hapgood worked closely with the nearby Brotherhood of the Spirit New Age commune. After Charles Hapgood&#x27;s death, Beth Hapgood assembled a final volume of Babbitt&#x27;s trance lectures, &quot;Dare the Vision and Endure&quot; (1997).

<text>Endemic goitre is a type of goitre that is associated with dietary iodine deficiency.

==Cause==
Some inland areas, where soil and water lacks iodine compounds and consumption of marine foods is low, are known for higher incidence of goitre. In such areas goitre is said to be &quot;endemic&quot;.

==Prevention==
This type of goitre is easily preventable. In most developed countries regulations have been put into force by health policy institutions requiring salt, flour or water to be fortified with iodine.

==Treatment==

Treatment of endemic goitre is medical with iodine and thyroxine preparations. Surgery is only necessary in cases that are complicated by significant compression of nearby structures.

<doc id="80251" wikidata="Q5178351" url="?curid=80251" title="High Court of Chivalry">
<text>His Majesty&#x27;s High Court of Chivalry is a civil law (as opposed to common law) court in English and Welsh law with jurisdiction over matters of heraldry. The court has been in existence since the fourteenth century; however, it rarely sits. The sole judge is now the hereditary Earl Marshal of England, the Duke of Norfolk, though if not a professional lawyer, he normally appoints a professional lawyer as his lieutenant or .

In Scotland, these types of cases are heard in the Court of the Lord Lyon, which is a standing civil and criminal court, with its own judge – the Lord Lyon King of Arms and its own (public prosecutor) under the Scottish legal system.

==History==

The court was historically known as the &quot;Curia Militaris&quot;, the &quot;Court of the Constable and the Marshal&quot;, or the &quot;Earl Marshal&#x27;s Court&quot;. The court was established some time prior to the late fourteenth century with jurisdiction over certain military matters, which came to include misuse of arms. It was instituted by Edward III, along with the Earl and other key personnel.

Since it was created in the fourteenth century, the court has always sat when required, except for the short time between 1634 and its temporary abolition by the Long Parliament in 1640 when it sat on a regular basis. During this time, the court heard well over a thousand cases, of which evidence survives from 738 cases.

Its jurisdiction and powers were successively reduced by the common law courts to the point where, after 1737, the court ceased to be convened and was in time regarded as obsolete and no longer in existence. That understanding was authoritatively overturned, however, by a revival of the court in 1954, when the Earl Marshal appointed the then Lord Chief Justice to sit as his surrogate. The Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard confirmed that the court retained both its existence and its powers, and ruled in favour of the suit before him.

==Sittings==

The court was last convened in 1954 for the case of &quot;Manchester Corporation v Manchester Palace of Varieties Ltd&quot;. Prior to this, the court had not sat for two centuries (since 1737), and before hearing the case, the court first had to rule whether it still existed. The proceedings opened with the reading of various letters patent in order to make clear that the Duke of Norfolk was indeed Hereditary Earl Marshal and that he had appointed Lord Goddard, who was the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, as his lieutenant in the court. It also had ruled that the Earl Marshal was allowed to sit in judgment without the Lord High Constable of England, an office which until 1521 was also held as a hereditary dignity by the Dukes of Buckingham. The case itself was that the Palace Theatre had been displaying the arms of the Manchester Corporation (now Manchester City Council) both inside and on its seal and this usage implied that it was linked with the city&#x27;s council. The corporation had requested that the theatre stop using it, but this request had been refused. The court ruled in favour of the corporation.

==Appeals from the court==
In 1832, the Privy Council Appeals Act 1832 made the Privy Council the appeal court for cases heard by the High Court of Chivalry. From 1 February 1833, following the passage of the Judicial Committee Act 1833, appeals have been heard directly by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Prior to that, and in common with the admiralty and ecclesiastical courts, appeals from the Court of Chivalry were made to the Crown in Chancery, with appeals being heard by commissioners appointed by letters patent under the Great Seal in each case. Sittings by these commissioners became known as the High Court of Delegates by the time of the 1832 Act.

==Composition==
===Judges===
Historically the court had two hereditary judges – the Duke of Norfolk as Earl Marshal of England, and the Duke of Buckingham as Lord High Constable of England – but in 1521 Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham was convicted of treason, stripped of his titles and offices, and executed. Since then the office of Lord High Constable of England has only been appointed to perform ceremonial duties during a Coronation and there has only been the Earl Marshal acting as the sole judge.

<doc id="80252" wikidata="Q173527" url="?curid=80252" title="Knossos">
<text>Knossos (; , ; Linear B: &quot;Ko-no-so&quot;) is a Bronze Age archaeological site in Crete. The site was a major centre of the Minoan civilization and is known for its association with the Greek myth of Theseus and the minotaur. It is located on the outskirts of Heraklion, and remains a popular tourist destination. Knossos is considered by many to be the oldest city in Europe.

Knossos is dominated by the monumental Palace of Minos. Like other Minoan palaces, this complex of buildings served as a combination religious and administrative centre rather than a royal residence. The earliest parts of the palace were built around 1900 BC in an area that had been used for ritual feasting since the Neolithic. The palace was continually renovated and expanded over the next five centuries until its final destruction around 1350 BC.

The site was first excavated by Minos Kalokairinos in 1877. In 1900, Sir Arthur Evans undertook more extensive excavations which unearthed most of the palace as well as many now-famous artifacts including the Bull-Leaping Fresco, the snake goddess figurines, and numerous Linear B tablets. While Evans is often credited for discovering the Minoan Civilization, his work is controversial in particular for his inaccurate and irreversible reconstructions of architectural remains at the site.

== History ==

===Neolithic period===
Knossos was settled around 7000 BC during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, making it the oldest known settlement in Crete. Radiocarbon dating has suggested dates around 7,030-6,780 BCE. The initial settlement was a hamlet of 25–50 people who lived in wattle and daub huts, kept animals, grew crops, and, in the event of tragedy, buried their children under the floor. Remains from this period are concentrated in the area which would later become the central court of the palace, suggesting continuity in ritual activity.
In the Early Neolithic (6000–5000 BC), a village of 200–600 persons occupied most of the area of the later palace and the slopes to the north and west. Residents lived in one- or two-room square houses of mud-brick walls set on socles of stone, either field stone or recycled stone artifacts. The inner walls were lined with mud-plaster. The roofs were flat, composed of mud over branches. The residents dug hearths at various locations in the centre of the main room. This village had an unusual feature: one house under the West Court contained eight rooms and covered . The walls were at right angles and the door was centred. Large stones were used for support under points of greater stress. The fact that distinct sleeping cubicles for individuals was not the custom suggests storage units of some sort.

The settlement of the Middle Neolithic (5000–4000 BC), housed 500–1000 people in more substantial and presumably more family-private homes. Construction was the same, except the windows and doors were timbered, a fixed, raised hearth occupied the centre of the main room, and pilasters and other raised features (cabinets, beds) occupied the perimeter. Under the palace was the Great House, a area stone house divided into five rooms with meter-thick walls suggesting a second storey was present. The presence of the house, which is unlikely to have been a private residence like the others, suggests a communal or public use; i.e., it may have been the predecessor of a palace. In the Late or Final Neolithic (two different but overlapping classification systems, around 4000–3000 BC), the population increased dramatically.

===Bronze Age===
It is believed that the first Cretan palaces were built soon after , in the early part of the Middle Minoan period, at Knossos and other sites including Malia, Phaestos and Zakro. These palaces, which were to set the pattern of organisation in Crete and Greece through the second millennium, were a sharp break from the Neolithic village system that had prevailed thus far. The building of the palaces implies greater wealth and a concentration of authority, both political and religious. It is suggested that they followed eastern models such as those at Ugarit on the Syrian coast and Mari on the upper Euphrates.

The early palaces were destroyed during Middle Minoan II, sometime before , almost certainly by earthquakes to which Crete is prone. By , they had been rebuilt on a grander scale and the period of the second palaces () marks the height of Minoan prosperity. All the palaces had large central courtyards which may have been used for public ceremonies and spectacles. Living quarters, storage rooms and administrative centres were positioned around the court and there were also working quarters for skilled craftsmen.

The palace of Knossos was by far the largest, covering three acres with its main building alone and five acres when separate out-buildings are considered. It had a monumental staircase leading to state rooms on an upper floor. A ritual cult centre was on the ground floor. The palace stores occupied sixteen rooms, the main feature in these being the &quot;pithoi&quot; that were large storage jars up to five feet tall. They were mainly used for storage of oil, wool, wine, and grain. Smaller and more valuable objects were stored in lead-lined cists. The palace had bathrooms, toilets, and a drainage system. A theatre was found at Knossos that would have held 400 spectators (an earlier one has been found at Phaestos). The orchestral area was rectangular, unlike later Athenian models, and they were probably used for religious dances.

Building techniques at Knossos were typical. The foundations and lower course were stonework with the whole built on a timber framework of beams and pillars. The main structure was built of large, unbaked bricks. The roof was flat with a thick layer of clay over brushwood. Internal rooms were brightened by light-wells and columns of wood, many fluted, were used to lend both support and dignity. The chambers and corridors were decorated with frescoes showing scenes from everyday life and scenes of processions. Warfare is conspicuously absent. The fashions of the time may be seen in depictions of women in various poses. They had elaborately dressed hair and wore long dresses with flounced skirts and puffed sleeves. Their bodices were tightly drawn in round their waists and their breasts were exposed.

The prosperity of Knossos was primarily based upon the development of native Cretan resources such as oil, wine, and wool. Another factor was the expansion of trade, evidenced by Minoan pottery found in Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, Rhodes, the Cyclades, Sicily, and mainland Greece. There seem to have been strong Minoan connections with Rhodes, Miletus, and Samos. Cretan influence may be seen in the earliest scripts found in Cyprus. The main market for Cretan wares was the Cyclades where there was a demand for pottery, especially the stone vases. It is not known whether the islands were subject to Crete or just trading partners, but there certainly was strong Cretan influence.

Around 1450 BC, the palaces at Malia, Phaestos, and Zakros were destroyed, leaving Knossos as the sole surviving palace on Crete. In this final period, Knossos seems to have been influenced or perhaps ruled by people from the mainland. Greek became the administrative language and the material culture shows parallels with Mycenaean styles, for instance in the architecture of tombs and styles of pottery.

Around 1350 BC, the palace was destroyed and not rebuilt. The building was ravaged by a fire which triggered the collapse of the upper stories. It is not known whether this final destruction was intentional or the result of a natural disaster such as an earthquake. While parts of the palace may have been used for later ceremonies and the town of Knossos saw a resurgence around 1200 BC, the building and its associated institutions were never restored.

=== Classical and Roman period ===
After the Bronze Age, the town of Knossos continued to be occupied. By 1000 BC, it had reemerged as one of the most important centres of Crete. The city had two ports, one at Amnisos and another at Heraklion.

According to the ancient geographer Strabo the Knossians colonized the city of Brundisium in Italy. In 343 BC, Knossos was allied with Philip II of Macedon. The city employed a Phocian mercenary named Phalaikos against their enemy, the city of Lyttus. The Lyttians appealed to the Spartans who sent their king Archidamus III against the Knossians. In Hellenistic times Knossos came under Egyptian influence, but despite considerable military efforts during the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC), the Ptolemies were not able to unify the warring city states. In the third century BC Knossos expanded its power to dominate almost the entire island, but during the Lyttian War in 220 BC it was checked by a coalition led by the Polyrrhenians and the Macedonian king Philip V.

Twenty years later, during the Cretan War (205–200 BC), the Knossians were once more among Philip&#x27;s opponents and, through Roman and Rhodian aid, this time they managed to liberate Crete from the Macedonian influence. With Roman aid, Knossos became once more the first city of Crete, but, in 67 BC, the Roman Senate chose Gortys as the capital of the newly created province Creta et Cyrene. In 36 BC, Knossos became a Roman colony named &quot;Colonia Iulia Nobilis&quot;. The colony, which was built using Roman-style architecture, was situated within the vicinity of the palace, but only a small part of it has been excavated.

The identification of Knossos with the Bronze Age site is supported by the Roman coins that were scattered over the fields surrounding the pre-excavation site, then a large mound named Kephala Hill, elevation from current sea level. Many of them were inscribed with Knosion or Knos on the obverse and an image of a Minotaur or Labyrinth on the reverse. The coins came from the Roman settlement of &quot;Colonia Julia Nobilis Cnossus&quot;, a Roman colony placed just to the north of, and politically including, Kephala. The Romans believed they were the first to colonize Knossos.

===Post-Roman history===
In 325, Knossos became a diocese, suffragan of the metropolitan see of Gortyna. In Ottoman Crete, the see of Knossos was in Agios Myron, 14 km to the southwest. The bishops of Gortyn continued to call themselves bishops of Knossos until the nineteenth century. The diocese was abolished in 1831.

During the ninth century AD the local population shifted to the new town of Chandax (modern Heraklion). By the thirteenth century, it was called the Makruteikhos &#x27;Long Wall&#x27;.

In its modern history, the name Knossos is used only for the archaeological site. It was extensively excavated by Arthur Evans in the early 20th century, and Evans&#x27; residence at the site served as a military headquarters during World War II. Knossos is now situated in the expanding suburbs of Heraklion.

==Legends==
In Greek mythology, King Minos dwelt in a palace at Knossos. He had Daedalus construct a labyrinth, a very large maze in which to retain his son, the Minotaur. Daedalus also built a dancing floor for Queen Ariadne. The name &quot;Knossos&quot; was subsequently adopted by Arthur Evans.

As far as is currently known, it was William Stillman, the American consul who published Kalokairinos&#x27; discoveries, who, seeing the sign of the double axe (&quot;labrys&quot;) on the massive walls partly uncovered by Kalokairinos, first associated the complex with the labyrinth of legend, calling the ruins &quot;labyrinthine.&quot; Evans agreed with Stillman. The myth of the Minotaur tells that Theseus, a prince from Athens, whose father was an ancient Greek king named Aegeus, the basis for the name of the Greek sea (the Aegean Sea), sailed to Crete, where he was forced to fight a terrible creature called the Minotaur. The Minotaur was a half man, half bull, and was kept in the Labyrinth – a building like a maze – by King Minos, the ruler of Crete. The king&#x27;s daughter, Ariadne, fell in love with Theseus. Before he entered the Labyrinth to fight the Minotaur, Ariadne gave him a ball of thread which he unwound as he went into the Labyrinth so that he could find his way back by following it. Theseus killed the Minotaur, and then he and Ariadne fled from Crete, escaping her angry father.

As it turns out, there probably was an association of the word &quot;labyrinth&quot;, whatever its etymology, with ancient Crete. The sign of the double axe was used throughout the Mycenaean world as an apotropaic mark: its presence on an object would prevent it from being &quot;killed&quot;. Axes were scratched on many of the stones of the palace. It appears in pottery decoration and is a motif of the Shrine of the Double Axes at the palace, as well as of many shrines throughout Crete and the Aegean. And finally, it appears in Linear B on Knossos Tablet Gg702 as da-pu2-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja, which probably represents the Mycenaean Greek, &quot;Daburinthoio potniai&quot;, &quot;to the mistress of the Labyrinth,&quot; recording the distribution of one jar of honey. A credible theory uniting all the evidence has yet to be formulated.

Knossos appears in other later legends and literature. Herodotus wrote that Minos, the legendary king of Knossos, established a thalassocracy (sea empire). Thucydides accepted the tradition and added that Minos cleared the sea of pirates, increased the flow of trade and colonised many Aegean islands. Other literature describes Rhadamanthus as the mythological lawgiver of Crete. Cleinias of Crete attributes to him the tradition of Cretan gymnasia and common meals in Book I of Plato&#x27;s Laws, and describes the logic of the custom as enabling a constant state of war readiness.

==Excavation history==
The site of Knossos was identified by Minos Kalokairinos, who excavated parts of the West Wing in the winter of 1878-1879. The British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans (1851–1941) and his team began long-term evacuations from 1900 to 1913, and from 1922 to 1930.

Its size far exceeded his original expectations, as did the discovery of two ancient scripts, which he termed Linear A and Linear B, to distinguish their writing from the pictographs also present. From the layering of the palace, Evans developed an archaeological concept of the civilization that used it, which he called Minoan, following the pre-existing custom of labelling all objects from the location Minoan.

Since their discovery, the ruins have been the centre of excavation, tourism, and occupation as a headquarters by governments warring over the control of the eastern Mediterranean in two world wars.

John Davies Evans (no relation to Arthur Evans) undertook further excavations in pits and trenches over the palace, focusing on the Neolithic.

==Palace complex==


The palace at Knossos was continuously renovated and modified throughout its existence. The currently visible palace is an accumulation of features from various periods, alongside modern reconstructions which are often inaccurate. Thus, the palace was never exactly as it appears today.

=== Layout ===

Like other Minoan palaces, Knossos was arranged around a rectangular central court. This court was twice as long north-south as it was east-west, an orientation that would have maximized sunlight, and positioned important rooms towards the rising sun.

The central court is believed to have been used for rituals and festivals. One of these festivals is believed to be depicted in the &quot;Grandstand Fresco&quot;. Some scholars have suggested that bull-leaping would have taken place in the courts, though others have argued that the paving would not have been optimal for the animals or the people, and that the restricted access points would have kept the spectacle too far out of public view.

The of the palace included a theater, a main entrance on each of its four cardinal faces, and extensive storerooms.

===Location===


The palace was built on &quot;Kephala Hill&quot;, south of the coast. The site is located at the confluence of two streams called the Vlychia and the Kairatos, which would have provided drinking water to the ancient inhabitants. Looming over the right bank of the Vlychia, on the opposite shore from Knossos, is Gypsades Hill, on whose eastern side the Minoans quarried their gypsum.

Though it was surrounded by the town of Knossos, this hill was never an acropolis in the Greek sense. It had no steep heights, remained unfortified, and was not very high off the surrounding ground.

The Royal Road is the last vestige of a Minoan road that connected the port to the palace complex. Today a modern road, Leoforos Knosou, built over or replacing the ancient roadway, serves that function and continues south.

===Storage===

The palace had extensive storage magazines which were used for agricultural commodities as well as tableware. Enormous sets of high quality tableware were stored in the palaces, often produced elsewhere in Crete. Pottery at Knossos is prolific, heavily-decorated and uniquely-styled by period. In Minoan chronology, the standard relative chronology is largely based on pottery styles and is thus used to assign dates to layers of the palace.

===Water management===
The palace had at least three separate water-management systems: one for supply, one for drainage of runoff, and one for drainage of waste water.

Aqueducts brought fresh water to Kephala hill from springs at Archanes, about 10 km away. Springs there are the source of the Kairatos river, in the valley in which Kephala is located. The aqueduct branched to the palace and to the town. Water was distributed at the palace by gravity feed through terracotta pipes to fountains and spigots. The pipes were tapered at one end to make a pressure fit, with rope for sealing. Unlike Mycenae, no hidden springs have been discovered.

Sanitation drainage was through a closed system leading to a sewer apart from the hill. The queen&#x27;s megaron contained an example of the first known water-flushing system latrine adjoining the bathroom. This toilet was a seat over a drain that was flushed by pouring water from a jug. The bathtub located in the adjoining bathroom similarly had to be filled by someone heating, carrying, and pouring water, and must have been drained by overturning into a floor drain or by bailing. This toilet and bathtub were exceptional structures within the 1,300-room complex.

As the hill was periodically drenched by torrential rains, a runoff system was a necessity. It began with channels in the flat surfaces, which were zigzag and contained catchment basins to control the water velocity. Probably the upper system was open. Manholes provided access to parts that were covered.

Some links to photographs of parts of the water-collection-management system follow.

*Runoff system. Note the zig-zags and the catchment basin.

===Ventilation===
Due to its placement on the hill, the palace received sea breezes during the summer. It had porticoes and air shafts.

===Minoan columns===
The palace also includes the Minoan column, a structure notably different from Greek columns. Unlike the stone columns that are characteristic of Greek architecture, the Minoan column was constructed from the trunk of a cypress tree, which is common to the Mediterranean. While Greek columns are smaller at the top and wider at the bottom to create the illusion of greater height (entasis), the Minoan columns are smaller at the bottom and wider at the top, a result of inverting the cypress trunk to prevent sprouting once in place. The columns at the Palace of Minos were plastered, painted red and mounted on stone bases with round, pillow-like capitals.

===Frescoes===

The palace at Knossos used considerable amounts of colour, as were Greek buildings in the classical period. In the EM Period, the walls and pavements were coated with a pale red derived from red ochre. In addition to the background colouring, the walls displayed fresco panel murals, entirely of red. In the subsequent MM Period, with the development of the art, white and black were added, and then blue, green, and yellow. The pigments were derived from natural materials, such as ground hematite. Outdoor panels were painted on fresh stucco with the motif in relief; indoor, on fresh, pure plaster, softer than the plaster with additives ordinarily used on walls.

The decorative motifs were generally bordered scenes: humans, legendary creatures, animals, rocks, vegetation, and marine life. The earliest imitated pottery motifs. Most have been reconstructed from various numbers of flakes fallen to the floor. Evans had various technicians and artists work on the project, some artists, some chemists, and restorers. The symmetry and use of templates made possible a degree of reconstruction beyond what was warranted by only the flakes. For example, if evidence of the use of a certain template existed scantily in one place, the motif could be supplied from the template found somewhere else. Like the contemporary murals in the funerary art of the Egyptians, certain conventions were used that also assisted prediction. For example, male figures are shown with darker or redder skin than female figures.

Some archaeological authors have objected that Evans and his restorers were not discovering the palace and civilization as it was, but were creating a modern artifact based on contemporary art and architecture.

===Throne Room===
The centrepiece of the &quot;Minoan&quot; palace was the so-called Throne Room or Little Throne Room, dated to LM II. This chamber has an alabaster seat which Evans referred to as a &quot;throne&quot; built into the north wall. On three sides of the room are gypsum benches. On the south side of the throne room there is a feature called a &quot;lustral basin&quot;, so-called because Evans found remains of unguent flasks inside it and speculated that it had been used as part of an annointing ritual.

The room was accessed from an anteroom through double doors. The anteroom was connected to the central court, which was four steps up through four doors. The anteroom had gypsum benches also, with carbonized remains between two of them thought possibly to be a wooden throne. Both rooms are located in the ceremonial complex on the west of the central court.

The throne is flanked by the Griffin Fresco, with two griffins couchant (lying down) facing the throne, one on either side. Griffins were important mythological creatures, also appearing on seal rings, which were used to stamp the identities of the bearers into pliable material, such as clay or wax.

The actual use of the room and the throne is unclear.

The two main theories are as follows:

* The seat of a priest-king or a queen. This is the older theory, originating with Evans. In that regard Matz speaks of the &quot;heraldic arrangement&quot; of the griffins, meaning that they are more formal and monumental than previous Minoan decorative styles. In this theory, the Mycenaeans would have held court in this room, as they came to power in Knossos at about 1,450. The &quot;lustral basin&quot; and the location of the room in a sanctuary complex cannot be ignored; hence, &quot;priest-king&quot;.
* A room reserved for the epiphany of a goddess, who would have sat in the throne, either in effigy, or in the person of a priestess, or in imagination only. In that case the griffins would have been purely a symbol of divinity rather than a heraldic motif.

<text>Burmeister &amp; Wain was a large established Danish shipyard and leading diesel engine producer headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark. Founded by two Danes and an Englishman, its earliest roots stretch back to 1846. Over its 150-year history, it grew successfully into a strong company through the end of the 1960s. In the 1970s, global competitive pressures, particularly from the far east, began to take their toll. In 1980, B&amp;W became MAN B&amp;W Diesel A/S, part of MAN B&amp;W Diesel Group, a subsidiary of the German corporation MAN AG, with operations worldwide. The company still maintains operations at three main sites in Denmark for manufacturing, servicing, and licensing of its two-stroke engines and complete propulsion systems.

==History==
===Origins===
Hans Heinrich Baumgarten (1806–1875) was from the town of Halstenbek near Pinneberg, in the Duchy of Holstein, an area of Germany that was then under the rule of the king of Denmark. He was apprenticed as a coffin maker by a farmer whose livestock he cared for. Later he was a carpenter before becoming a machine minder at the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende, whose printing office he later worked for in Berlin.
After trying to start a business with different partners, while in Berlin he was allowed an audience, on the subject of establishing a business in Copenhagen, with Crown Prince Christian of Denmark who was visiting. Shortly thereafter, in 1843 he was granted a Danish Royal Charter and what would later become Burmeister &amp; Wain was launched with the opening of a mechanical workshop in Copenhagen.

===Earliest years===
Carl Christian Burmeister (1821–1898) was born into poverty. The son of a cook and restaurant keeper, he studied at the Polytechnical Institute in Copenhagen from 1836 to 1846, now the Technical University of Denmark. He had been awarded a scholarship abroad after recommendation following an assistantship to Hans Christian Ørsted (1777–1851) who was director there at the time. Burmeister joined the H.H. Baumgarten Company in 1846, which became a partnership with the opening of its engineering works, and was renamed B&amp;B.

Soon came the establishment of the B&amp;B foundry in 1847, the delivery of its first steam engine in 1848, the renting of the Jacob Holm Shipyard at the &#x27;Englishman&#x27;s Place&#x27; in 1851, and the delivery of their first ship S/S Hermod in 1854, before Baumgarten retired from regular duties in 1861. With Baumgarten as a co-owner, in 1865, William Wain (1819–1882) joined what then became B&amp;W. In 1872 the company became A/S B&amp;W (&quot;Aktieselskabet Burmeister &amp; Wain&quot;), a limited liability corporation. That same year saw the founding of the Refshale Island shipyard. At this point, Baumgarten, as the first founder, became a director of the board of what he would see become Burmeister &amp; Wain &quot;Maskin- og Skibsbyggeri&quot; (Engineering and Shipbuilding) in 1880. Wain, from Bolton, England had apprenticed as an engineer in his youth and come up through the trades. He had worked for the Royal Danish Navy and the Royal Dutch dockyards. He came to have several designs to his credit within the company and his ingenuity was seen as &quot;instrumental&quot; in establishing its reputation. In 1881 B&amp;W bought the patent for a milk separator from Peterson Brothers and by 1905 produced a range of dairy equipment, employing about 3,000 staff in their &#x27;Perfect&#x27; works in Copenhagen.


===Growth and development===
Production of stationary &quot;paraffin&quot; engines began in 1890. Then, in 1898, a year after introducing it to the world, B&amp;W director Ivar Knudsen (1861–1920) negotiated with Rudolf Diesel exclusive Danish manufacturing rights for the diesel engine. A test engine was built that same year. The 1903-1904 year saw delivery of their first diesel engine to the N. Larsen Carriage Factory. 1911-1912 saw the world&#x27;s first ever ocean-going diesel-powered ship, M/S Selandia, start her maiden voyage from Copenhagen to Bangkok with two B&amp;W four-stroke main engines (furnishing a total of 2,500 hp).

The larger Teglholmen iron foundry was established in the 1920-1921 year to provide capacity for growth in the coming years of business acquisition. 

William Elmgreen worked at Burmeister &amp; Wain in Copenhagen as a 20 year old apprentice in 1922. His father Jens Peter Elmgreen had worked there in the 1890s. He later recalled that at that time some 12,000 workers were engaged to build ships, manufacture diesel engines and carry out ship repairs of all kinds. He was one of 2,500 men on Refshale Island, building and repairing ships. They had private lockers for their gear, their bikes were sheltered in enormous sheds, and had access to modern shower rooms – all regarded as modern conveniences in 1922. In the canteen - seating 2,500 - a hot lunch cost 0.75 Kr, and beer was also available in unlimited quantities. On one hot summer&#x27;s day, seventy cases @ 50 bottles per case of beer were consumed in the canteen by the workers in their lunch hour and a half. Well-cooked food was picked up at the food bar, run by the Workers’ Cooperative, milk and soft drinks were also available. Tools were available at the tool sheds, workers signed for them and paid if they lost any. Each worker was allocated a number (his was 2274). He was engaged on a piece work basis, and worked in a propeller gang.

The first B&amp;W two-stroke diesel engine set off to sea in 1930 and the world&#x27;s largest diesel engine at the time was delivered in 1933 to H. C. Ørsted Power Station.
Steady progress and consolidation continued through the period of World War II and the subsequent period of reinvigorated prosperity. The first turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine was commissioned in 1952 with larger and more innovative designs to follow.

By this point, the company&#x27;s engines and licensed designs were used worldwide throughout the industry. Meanwhile, post-war east Asian economies began to emerge as an industrial force.

===Recent adjustment and recovery===
In 1971, the shipyard and the engineering works were split into two independent companies. A more challenging period ensued until the 1979-1980 year when B&amp;W Diesel A/S was established, and its shares were sold to MAN, of Germany. Though engine production at Christianshavn was later discontinued in 1987, successful engine programs were rolled out. At Teglholmen in 1988 a spare parts and key components production factory was established as was an R&amp;D Centre at the same site in 1992. Though all Copenhagen operations were consolidated at Teglholmen in 1994 and the last volume production unit at the B&amp;W Shipyard was delivered in 1996. In 2000 MAN B&amp;W Diesel two-stroke diesel engines had over 70% market share, with a substantial number of MC-line engines on order.

The electronically controlled line of ME diesel two-stroke engines was added in 2002 with a maximum cylinder bore of 108 cm. MAN B&amp;W Diesel, Denmark, employed approximately 2,200 at the end of 2003 and had 100 million kW, or more than 8000 MC engines, in service or on order by 2004.

<text>Sale is a city situated in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia and the council capital of the Shire of Wellington. It had an estimated population of 15,305 in 2022 according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The total population including the immediate area around the town is approximately 19,000 according to shire website. 

==History==
The Aboriginal name for the Sale area is Wayput. Two famous Gippsland explorers, Paul Strzelecki and Angus McMillan, passed through the immediate area around 1840. The first white settler was Archibald McIntosh who arrived in 1844 and established his &#x27;Flooding Creek&#x27; property on the flood plain country which was duly inundated soon after his arrival. In 2021, there was a proposal by locals to change the town name from &#x27;Sale&#x27; − due to similarity with English word, sale − to either, &#x27;Wayput&#x27; or &#x27;Flooding Creek&#x27;, but turned out to be unsuccessful. 

In the 1840&#x27;s, drovers heading south to Port Albert crossed Flooding Creek and were confronted with the difficult marsh country around the Thomson and Latrobe rivers. A punt operated across the Latrobe River until a toll bridge was erected. A Post Office named Flooding Creek opened here on 30 September 1848 being renamed, somewhat belatedly, as Sale on 1 January 1854.

The first town plots went on sale in 1850. When the new settlement was gazetted in 1851 it was named &quot;Sale&quot; – a tribute to General Sir Robert Sale, a British army officer who won fame in the first Afghan war before being killed in battle in India in 1845. An SBS TV documentary, &quot;&quot;, claims that it is actually named after his wife, Lady Florentia Sale (1790–1853), who wrote a famous journal of her experiences during the First Anglo-Afghan War which became a best seller in the 1840&#x27;s and was serialised in &quot;The Times&quot; (UK) and possibly in Australia. Certainly, her letters to her husband were enthusiastically published in Australian papers.

The town greatly benefitted from the 1851 gold rush at Omeo as it was situated on the Port Albert to Omeo route and was an important base for the goldfields, until the arrival of the Gippsland railway line. It was also an important service centre for East Gippsland and the Monaro Plains of New South Wales. A building boom took place c. 1855–65.

In 1863 the population of Sale reached 1800 and it became a borough. The courthouse opened the following year. Shops, hotels and offices spilled over into Raymond Street and the first Anglican Church was erected on the site now occupied by St Anne&#x27;s and Gippsland Grammar School. The &quot;Gippsland Times&quot; newspaper was established in 1861 while the first Star Hotel and the Criterion Hotel were built in 1865.

In late December 1874, a visitor to the township recorded a description of Sale “which has all the appearances of a flourishing township”. He observed that “the streets are wide and shops plentiful, but fruit is scarce, a few stale cherries being all I could obtain from the principal shop in the place”.

St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is the cathedral church of the Anglican Diocese of Gippsland in Australia. The cathedral building, built in 1884, is a double-storey building with a rectangular footprint and is constructed of red brick and slate roofing.
In terms of access, the first reasonable road from Melbourne arrived in 1865 and Cobb &amp; Co established a rough-and-ready 24-hour coach service linking Melbourne and Sale. The Latrobe Wharf was built in the 1870s and two hotels emerged to exploit the new centre of activity. It was located near the present swing bridge although little is left.

Anthony Trollope visited Sale in 1872. Writing of the experience in Australia and New Zealand (1873) he spoke of the town&#x27;s &quot;innumerable hotels&quot; and concluded from his impressions that the Aborigines had little chance of surviving as a race. The children&#x27;s author Mary Grant Bruce was born in the town in 1878.

A two-storey post office, with clock tower, was built in 1884 (it was demolished in 1963). HM Prison Sale was completed in 1887 and it operated for 110 years until it was replaced by a private Fulham Correctional Centre. The building has since been demolished, with only part of the large brick fencing still remaining. The site remained empty until 2014 when construction of the new Sale Police Station commenced there. It opened in March 2015.
Other landmarks in the town include Our Lady of Sion Convent and the Criterion Hotel. The former was designed by architects Reed, Smart and Tappin and built 1892–1901. Assembly halls and dormitory rear wing were added in 1938; the residential wing was added in 1953. The building is listed on the Register of the National Estate. The Criterion Hotel was built in 1865. It originally had a two-storey timber verandah, but this was replaced by a cast iron verandah between 1880 and 1900. It is considered &quot;one of the most impressive hostelries in Victoria&quot; and is listed on the Register of the National Estate. The Criterion Hotel closed in 2006 and its rapidly deteriorating condition caused local concern that it would be demolished. However, the site was subsequently purchased by a Traralgon-based developer who had previous expertise in restoration of commercial buildings. The Criterion received a complete rebuild in 2010/11 with the external heritage facade and verandah fully restored. It re-opened as a hotel, function venue and restaurant early in 2013.

With the growth of shipping on the local waterways and the Gippsland Lakes (and the establishment of a railhead at Sale in 1879) schemes emerged to develop Sale as a port. The construction of the Sale Canal (complete with turning circle) duly commenced in the 1880s, thereby linking the town via the Thomson River and the Gippsland Lakes to the open sea. It was completed in 1890. Other elements were the Sale Swing Bridge, completed in 1883, a high wharf, and a launching ramp which still exists in the heart of the city. However, neither the bridge nor the canal created the desired surge of trade and the depression of the 1890s soon engulfed the town. Sale became a town in 1924 and a city in 1950.

In World War II, the West Sale RAAF base was the landing site of two Japanese Mitsubishi Zeros. After the war, the disused site was repurposed as a immigration centre called West Sale Migrant’s Camp (alternatively West Sale Migrant Holding Centre) from 1949–1953.

Sale has seen much development and redevelopment in the past decade, one example being the multimillion-dollar redevelopment of the city&#x27;s Port of Sale.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

===Oil and gas===
After oil was discovered offshore in 1965, the town experienced a boom period when it became the service and residential base of the Esso-BHP oil and gas exploration and development program. The unprocessed oil and gas are pumped through of undersea pipes to Longford, south of Sale. There the hydrocarbons are removed and used to produce LPG, commercial-grade natural gas, and stabilised oil. The gas is piped to Melbourne and the Victorian gas grid and up to New South Wales via the Eastern gas pipeline with a branch running under Bass Strait to Tasmania and the oil to Westernport Bay and thence to Geelong and Altona from where it is shipped interstate and overseas.

Esso&#x27;s Longford gas plant was the site of a major fire on 25 September 1998 which killed two employees and crippled the state&#x27;s gas supplies for a period of two weeks. Previously, Sale was significant as an office centre for the Esso corporation but these operations were relocated around 1990, leaving only the oil and gas processing facility in nearby Longford.

===Shopping===

Sale&#x27;s main shopping precincts are Gippsland Centre and adjacent Raymond St Mall. Most other shopping style stores including clothing, music and food can be found along Raymond St, known to be the main street of Sale.

===Events and attractions===
The March Labour Day weekend witnesses the Marley Point Overnight Yacht Race which is the longest overnight inland yacht race in the world. It begins near Sale and concludes at Paynesville, some 60 km away.

A Sale attraction is Lake Guthridge, a low lying retention basin, which features a park for children, barbecues, and a walking trail around the lake and car parking facilities. Prior to refurbishment in the mid-1990s Lake Guthridge suffered a blue-green algae problem that resulted in widespread fish mortality until local joggers and nearby residents complained of the associated stench causing council to act. Lake Guthridge has never been used as a food source.

A significantly superior natural waterway of historical significance is the aforementioned Port of Sale (previously &quot;Sale Canal&quot;), the original inspiration for the early town&#x27;s original name – &quot;Flooding Creek&quot;. The Canal connects to other local rivers and lakes, leading eventually to Lakes Entrance, an oceanside tourist resort situated near a managed, naturally occurring channel connecting the Gippsland Lakes to Bass Strait. Once steam boats and ocean-going craft were able to journey from Lakes Entrance to Sale, arriving at the docks at Sale to ferry passengers and goods from Eastern Victoria, although its success in such a role was short lived.

In recent years, a grassroots effort helped to persuade the local council to invest in restoration of the foreshore and to protect against erosion. Prior to the rise of Common Carp as the predominant fish species due to nutrient overload from agricultural runoff, Sale Canal featured pristine waters and native fish stocks. The Sale Regatta is run yearly on a long straight section of the canal headed towards Longford. Visitors to Sale are usually unaware of the Canal, including its restoration, due to roadside views of it being blocked by the former Esso corporation headquarters, half of which is commercially let office space and the other half having been re-developed into a multimillion-dollar Library and Art Gallery.

Sale is home to the Gippsland Art Gallery, a major Victorian public gallery. The gallery presents a diverse exhibition program of contemporary, modern and historical exhibitions, with a focus on the landscape of South Eastern Australia. The gallery holds a collection of nearly 1,000 artworks, with a small selection on permanent view.

A fishing contest is held at Lake Guthridge every Easter and the Sale Music Festival at Gippsland Grammar School in June. The Sale Art Exhibition is held over August and September, while the Sale show falls in October.

As a tribute to the late King George V, an elm-lined section of the Princes Highway is named &quot;King George V Avenue&quot;.

On 30 May 2009, Sale hosted Triple J&#x27;s One Night Stand at the Sale Football Ground. Sale also has a strong underground music scene; events are held every few months and attract scores of young people. 

The John Leslie Theatre (The Wedge) is the primary place to view live theatre, ballet and music, but also host conferences and presentations. Large events like the local Carols by Candlelight or Shakespearean performances are often performed outdoors at Fauna Park.

Every Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, the Gippsland Armed Forces Museum is open, featuring local military and significant history and artifacts. In recent times it has moved from its original location on Punt Lane to a bigger building at West Sale Airfield, after the original building was purchased for development works. The museum pays homage to the 13th Australian Light Horse Regiment, among others.

===Sports===
Australian rules football, soccer, basketball and cricket are the most popular sports in Sale. The Gippsland Regional Sports Complex hosts many other sports including basketball, Association rules football, volleyball, badminton, table tennis, indoor soccer, aerobics, group fitness and gym.

The city has two Australian rules football teams, Sale, competing in the Gippsland Football League and Sale City, who compete in the North Gippsland Football League.

Sale was one of pioneering centres of soccer in Gippsland, with a rich history dating back to 1925, where the club played in the North Gippsland Soccer Association (alongside Yallourn SC and clubs from Maffra, Glenmaggie and Nambrok)., with a league formed in 1926. The RAAF Base East Sale also later competed in the LVSL.

Sale United currently plays in the Latrobe Valley Soccer League and was crowned as league champions in 1980, as well as Battle of Britain Cup champions in 1955. The club was also the home of future National Soccer League star Marcus Stergiopoulos.

It is home to the Sale Sonics, a representative basketball team that competes in the Country Basketball League and is renowned for developing many elite Australian rules football and National Basketball League players including Billy Hughes, Jason Gram, Scott Pendlebury, Dylan McLaren and Rhys Carter .

The city is the home to two field hockey clubs in the East Gippsland Hockey Association. The Sale Hockey Club fields teams in juniors mixed under 13s, under 15s, and under 18s along with two women&#x27;s teams, the Sale Cygnets and the Sale Swans, along with one open team. The under 18s and open teams were champions in the 2008 season. The Wurruk Greyhounds are the Sale district&#x27;s second hockey team, located in the satellite town Wurruk.

<text>Favorinus (c. 80 – c. 160 AD) was a Roman sophist and skeptic philosopher who flourished during the reign of Hadrian and the Second Sophistic.

==Early life==
He was of Gaulish ancestry, born in Arelate (Arles). He received a refined education, first in Gallia Narbonensis and then in Rome, and at an early age began his lifelong travels through Greece, Italy and the East.

==Career==
Favorinus had extensive knowledge, combined with great oratorical powers, that raised him to eminence both in Athens and in Rome. He lived on close terms with Plutarch, with Herodes Atticus, to whom he bequeathed his library in Rome, with Demetrius the Cynic, Cornelius Fronto, Aulus Gellius, and with the emperor Hadrian. His great rival was Polemon of Smyrna, whom he vigorously attacked in his later years. He knew Greek very well.

After being silenced by Hadrian in an argument in which the sophist might easily have refuted his adversary, Favorinus subsequently explained that it was foolish to criticize the logic of the master of thirty legions. When the Athenians, feigning to share the emperor&#x27;s displeasure with the sophist, pulled down a statue which they had erected to him, Favorinus remarked that if only Socrates also had had a statue at Athens, he might have been spared the hemlock.

Hadrian banished Favorinus at some point in the 130s, to the island of Chios. Rehabilitated at the ascension of Antoninus Pius in 138, Favorinus returned to Rome, where he resumed his activities as an author and teacher of upper-class pupils. Among his students were Alexander Peloplaton, who would later teach and serve under Marcus Aurelius, and Herodes Atticus, who also taught Marcus Aurelius and to whom Favorinus bequeathed his library. His year of death is unknown, but he appears to have survived into his eighties, and died perhaps around 160 AD.

Lucian&#x27;s &quot;the Eunuch&quot; was probably modeled on Favorinus. Hofeneder and Amato also suggest that Favorinus is identical with the &quot;Celtic philosopher&quot; who explains the image of Ogmios in Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Hercules&quot;. Favorinus and Lucian have been grouped together by modern scholars as part of a &quot;group of intellectuals who were of ethnically disparate origins but were endowed with a Hellenistic education and outlook.&quot;

==Works==

Only one work by Favorinus survives, the &quot;Corinthian Oration&quot;, in which Favorinus complains to the Corinthians for having removed a statue that they had previously erected in his honour, presumably delivered in the aftermath of his disgrace by Hadrian. The oration is preserved in the corpus of Dio Chrysostom as Oration 37, but is nearly universally attributed to Favorinus by modern scholars.

Of the very numerous other works of Favorinus, we possess only a few fragments, preserved by Aulus Gellius, Diogenes Laërtius, Philostratus, Galen, and in the &quot;Suda&quot;, &quot;Pantodape Historia&quot; (miscellaneous history) and &quot;Apomnemoneumata&quot; (memoirs, things remembered). As a philosopher, Favorinus considered himself to be a Skeptic; his most important work in this connection appears to have been the &quot;Pyrrhonean Tropes&quot; in ten books, in which he endeavours to show that the Pyrrhonist Ten Modes of Aenesidemus were useful to those who intended to practise in the law courts.

Galen devoted to a polemic against Favorinus in &quot;De optima doctrina&quot;, opposing Favorinus’ thesis that the best instruction consists in the argument in which one speaks, in each particular question, in favour of opposite sides. Galen&#x27;s treatise says that Favorinus wrote a work &quot;On the Academic Disposition&quot; also called &quot;Plutarch&quot; and a work against Epictetus named &quot;Against Epictetus&quot; staging one of Plutarch’s slaves, Onesimus, arguing with Epictetus. Favorinus wrote &quot;On the Kataleptic Fantasy&quot; in which he is said to have denied the possibility of katalepsis, the key notion of Stoic epistemology.

One of the speeches of Favorinus contains the oldest example of &quot;psychomachia&quot;, suggesting that he may have invented the allegorical technique, which the Latin poet Prudentius later applied with so much success to the Christian soul resisting various kinds of temptation.

==Personal life==
Favorinus is described as a eunuch (εὐνοῦχος) by birth. Polemon of Laodicea, writer of a treatise on physiognomy, described Favorinus as &quot;a eunuch born without testicles&quot;, beardless and with a high-pitched, thin voice, while Philostratos described him as a hermaphrodite. Mason and others thus describe Favorinus as having an intersex trait. Retief and Cilliers suggest that the descriptions available are consistent with Reifenstein&#x27;s syndrome (androgen insensitivity syndrome).

Favorinus owned an Indian slave named Autolekythos.

<text>Roskilde ( , ) is a city west of Copenhagen on the Danish island of Zealand. With a population of 52,974 (), the city is a business and educational centre for the region and the 10th largest city in Denmark. It is governed by the administrative council of Roskilde Municipality.

Roskilde has a long history, dating from the pre-Christian Viking Age. Its UNESCO-listed Gothic cathedral, now housing 39 tombs of the Danish monarchs, was completed in 1275, becoming a focus of religious influence until the Reformation.
With the development of the rail network in the 19th century, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen, and by the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. Among the largest private sector employers today are the IT firm BEC (Bankernes EDB Central) and seed company DLF. The Risø research facility is also becoming a major employer, extending interest in sustainable energy to the clean technology sphere. The local university, founded in 1972, the historic Cathedral School, and the Danish Meat Trade College, established in 1964, are educational institutions of note. Roskilde has a large local hospital which has been expanded and modernized since it was opened in 1855. It is now increasingly active in the research sphere. The Sankt Hans psychiatric hospital serves the Capital Region with specialized facilities for forensic psychiatry.

The cathedral and the Viking Ship Museum, which contains the well-preserved remains of five 11th-century ships, attract more than 100,000 visitors annually. In addition to its internationally recognized tourist attractions and its annual rock festival, Roskilde is popular with shoppers thanks to its two centrally located pedestrian streets complete with restaurants, cafés, and a variety of shops. The city is home to the FC Roskilde football club which play in the Danish 1st Division, the Roskilde Vikings RK rugby club, and the rowing club, Roskilde Roklub. In the 1970s, the city benefited from the opening of the university and from the completion of the Holbæk Motorway connecting it to Copenhagen. Roskilde has the oldest operational railway station in Denmark, with connections across Zealand as well as with Falster, Lolland, and Jutland. The local airport opened in 1973, mainly serving light aircraft for business use and flight instruction.

Among the city&#x27;s notable citizens are Absalon, the bishop who founded Copenhagen in the 12th century, L. A. Ring, the symbolist painter who gained fame in the 1880s, the writer Lise Nørgaard who wrote the popular Danish TV series &quot;Matador&quot; in 1978 and the rower Thomas Ebert who became an Olympic gold medallist in 2004.

==History==
Roskilde, which developed as the hub of the Viking land and sea trade routes over a thousand years ago, is one of Denmark&#x27;s oldest cities. From the 11th century until 1443, it was the capital of Denmark. By the Middle Ages, with the support of kings and bishops, it had become one of the most important centres in Scandinavia. Saxo Grammaticus and other early sources associate the name &quot;Roskilde&quot; (meaning &#x27;Ro&#x27;s spring&#x27;) with the legendary King Roar who possibly lived there in the 6th century. 

According to Adam of Bremen and Saxo Grammaticus, Roskilde was founded in the 980s by Harald Bluetooth. On high ground above the harbour, he built a wooden church consecrated to the Holy Trinity as well as a royal residence nearby. Although no traces of these buildings have been discovered, in 1997 archaeologists found the remains of Viking ships in the Isefjord, the oldest of which is dated to 1030. At the time, there were also two churches in the area: St Jørgensbjerg, an early stone church, and a wooden church discovered under today&#x27;s St Ib&#x27;s Church.

In 1020, King Canute elevated Roskilde to a bishopric, giving it high national status. Absalon, the Danish bishop, had a brick church built on the site of Harald&#x27;s church in 1170. Today&#x27;s cathedral was completed in 1275 after five of Absalon&#x27;s successors had contributed to its construction. As a result of Absalon&#x27;s influence, many other churches were built in the vicinity, making Roskilde the most important town in Zealand. Coins were minted there from the 11th to the 14th century. In 1150, Sweyn Grathe built a moat around the city. In 1135 the town was destroyed by the Pomeranian duke Ratibor I. In 1151/2, a religious confraternity was founded for the defence of the town against Wendish pirates. Under the command of Wetheman, it also took part in the Wendish Crusade. The Roskilde bishops owned large areas of land in the region including, from 1186, Havn on the Øresund which later became Copenhagen. By the time of the Danish Reformation in 1536, there were 12 churches and five monasteries in the city.

It is unclear when Roskilde became a market town but it was certainly enjoying trading privileges under King Eric II who reigned from 1134 to 1137. These privileges were firmly established when the Roskilde City Council granted market town status to other towns on Zealand on 15 June 1268. By that time, it was probably the largest and most important town in Denmark. In 1370, the city owned 2,600 farms throughout Zealand.

The Reformation brought Roskilde&#x27;s development to an abrupt stop. While the cathedral continued to be the preferred location for the entombment of the Danish monarchs, most of the other religious institutions disappeared. For the next three centuries, the city suffered a series of disasters including the effects of the Dano-Swedish War which terminated with the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the plague in 1710 and 1711, and a series of fires in 1730. Conditions improved in 1835 when the city became the Assembly of the Estates of the Realm () and in 1847 with the railway connecting Copenhagen and Roskilde.
With the development of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a satellite community for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered from the fact that the harbour was too small and Roskilde Fjord too shallow for navigation. Industries began to move out of the harbour area but were still the largest source of employment, thanks in part to the spirits factory (&quot;De Danske Spritfabrikker&quot;) and the slaughterhouse ().

In the 1970s, the city benefited from the Holbæk Motorway which linked it to Copenhagen and the establishment of Roskilde University in 1972. Since the 1980s, the service sector has prospered, replacing manufacturing industry as the major employer (65% by 2002). With the increase in population, several new districts have grown up, including Himmelev and Kongebakken. Some of the surrounding villages such as Svogerslev, Vor Frue, Vindinge and Veddelev have developed as satellite communities.

==Geography==

Roskilde is located in north-central Zealand at the south end of Roskilde Fjord which is itself the south branch of the Isefjord. By road, it is west of downtown Copenhagen, northwest of Køge and northeast of Ringsted. The city centre around the cathedral, south of the fjord, is about above sea level. On the slope down to the harbour, there are a number of springs, the most powerful of which is Maglekilde. The historic centre of the town covers the area around the main streets Skomagergade and Algade including the squares of Stændertorvet and Hestetorvet. Two parks, Byparken and Folkeparken which run down towards the fjord, are immediately north of the old town.

Neighbourhoods in the vicinity include Himmelev, Hyrdehøj, Musicon, Sankt Jørgensbjerg and Trekroner. Boserup Skov, a wood next to Roskidle Fjord northwest of the city centre, consists mainly of beech trees. In spring, its hilly slopes are covered with wild flowers, including white, blue and yellow anemones. Chaffinches, nightingales and other songbirds can be heard in the early summer. Also of note is the recently planted wooded area of Hyrdehøj Skov, to the south of the stadium and just north of Route 23 in the southern outskirts of Roskilde.

==Demographics and administration==
As early as 1070, Adam von Bremen referred to Roskilde as &quot;Zealand&#x27;s largest town&quot;. At the time of the Reformation in 1536, it had some 6,000 inhabitants but as a result of war, fire and disease, by 1753 its population had dropped to only 1,550. By the 1860s, it had grown to around 5,000 and by the 1900s to some 9,000. Thereafter it increased appreciably until 1970 when there were almost 45,000 inhabitants. The population dipped slightly to 40,000 in the 1980s, but thanks to improved connections with Copenhagen and the establishment of the university, it grew steadily to reach 47,117 by 2014 making Roskilde Denmark&#x27;s tenth largest city.

In Roskilde Municipality as of 1 October 2014, 76,545 residents had Danish background, 6,287 were immigrants and 2,006 were second or third generation descendants of immigrants. The most common countries of birth of foreign-born residents of Roskilde Municipality are Turkey, Iraq, Poland and Afghanistan.

Roskilde is governed by the administrative council of Roskilde Municipality. Following the local elections of November 2013, Joy Mogensen (born 1980), a Social Democrat, was reappointed mayor (first elected mayor in 2011), gaining three additional seats on the council. The council now consists of 13 seats for the Social Democrats, one for the Social Liberal Party, one for the Conservative People&#x27;s Party, one for the Socialist People&#x27;s Party, three for the People&#x27;s Party, nine for the Left Liberal Party and three for the Red–Green Alliance.

== Economy ==

In the 1890s, 37% of Roskilde&#x27;s economy was in crafts and manufacturing industry with only 15% in administration and services. By 1984, industry had dropped to 16% while services had risen to 57%. In 2002, services had reached 62%, leaving industry at 15% and trade and transport at 22%.

===Companies===

One of the largest employers in Roskilde is BEC (Bankernes EDB Central) who provide IT services to the financial sector. In July 2014, Novo A/S acquired Sonion, producing micro-acoustical components for hearing aids. Top-Toy A/S with up to 200 employees is a major Scandinavian toy importer and retailer based in Tune near Roskilde Airport. DLF-Trifolium A/S, a seed producer for the farming sector, has its headquarters in Roskilde with a workforce of over 50. Rambøll, the international Danish engineering consultancy, has recently concentrated its Zealand operations in Roskilde bringing 60 new jobs to the city.

Among the city&#x27;s smaller companies are GPI (Glim Plastic Industri) established in 1987 producing plastic piping, Roskilde Galvanisering A/S, one of Denmark&#x27;s leading galvanization companies, and Mathiesen A/S, a wholesaler of office equipment. Vestergaard Company A/S, an American firm which produces de-icing equipment and washing products for the aviation industry, has offices in Roskilde. The new city district of Musicon has already attracted 29 businesses in the area of culture and the creative arts, providing over 1,000 jobs.

Several food industries have their headquarters or production facilities in Roskilde, including: Chr. Hansen A/S, producing cultures for the dairy industry, DanÆg, eggs, the Scandinavian Pizza Company, and Stryhns, a cold cuts and meat paste producer with over 100 on the payroll.

===Research parks===
There are a number of research institutes in the city including Risø, promoting sustainable energy, which is now part of The Technical University of Denmark. The research facilities are being extended over an additional to cover the clean technology area liable to provide up to 4,000 more jobs. The CAT (&quot;Center for Avanceret Teknologi&quot;) research park is also part of the university working mainly in the areas of wind energy and biotechnology. In the public sector, the Accident Investigation Board Denmark has its headquarters in Roskilde.

===Tourism===

An important component of the city&#x27;s economy is tourism which currently accounts for DKK 1.2 billion (US$200 million) per annum. Provisional figures show an increase of 16.6% in overnight stays for 2014. The cathedral and the Viking Ship Museum attract more than 100,000 visitors per year although 20 years ago there were some 200,000 visits to the cathedral.

The city is also popular with shoppers, having received Denmark&#x27;s Best Shopping City Award in 2012. In addition to a wide variety of shops and restaurants along its two downtown pedestrian streets, Algade and Skomagergade, Roskilde&#x27;s shopping centre RO&#x27;s Torv on Københavnsvej to the east of the city houses 70 stores under one roof.

One of the oldest restaurants in Roskilde is the &quot;Raadhuskælderen&quot;, in a building dated to 1430, noted for its salmon steak with tartar sauce and grilled chicken and cream sauce dishes. Also of note is &quot;La Brasserie&quot; on Algade, the &quot;Gimle Musikcafe&quot; on Ringstedgade, which is an English-style pub-restaurant with live music, and &quot;Restaurant Toppen&quot; at the top of an water tower, built in 1961, with fine views of the town. The 76-room Hotel Prindsen has foundations which date to 1695. It has been a hotel for over 100 years and is decorated in the Nordic style with wooden floors and contains the large luxury Hans Christian Andersen suite. Scandic Hotel Roskilde is a 98-room chain-run hotel established in 1989, with a restaurant serving Danish and international cuisine. The thatched-roof Svogerslev Kro is an 18-room inn dated to 1727 in the Svogerslev area, about 2.5 miles to the west of Roskilde&#x27;s centre.

==Cityscape==

The old town of Roskilde is centred around the main square, Stændertorvet, just south of the cathedral. The original street plan is preserved in nearby Skomagergade, Algade and Hestetorvet although most of the buildings were rebuilt after serious fires in the 18th century. The area is flanked to the north by two large parks, Byparken and Folkeparken, which stretch down to Roskilde Fjord.

The old town is bordered to the south by the railway and main station, beyond which there are commercial buildings and apartment blocks. The residential areas of Himmelev and Veddelev to the east and north of the city have grown up around former villages. More recently, with the establishment of Roskilde University even further to the east beyond the ring road, the district of Trekroner is in full development, expected to attain some 3,500 houses in the coming years.

One of the most exclusive residential districts of the city, Sankt Jørgensbjerg, covers the hilly area to the northwest, bordered by the fjord. Initially a fishing village dating back to the Viking era, it became part of Roskilde in 1938.

Finally, Roskilde Municipality is developing the innovative Musicon quarter to the south of the city in an area of where a cement factory once stood. Located in the same district as the fairgrounds used for the Roskilde Festival, there are medium-term plans for establishing creative companies and housing for young people in the area. A large rock museum named &quot;Ragnarock&quot; opened in April 2016.

== Landmarks==
=== Roskilde Cathedral ===
Located on the site of a 10th-century wooden church, the cathedral was built in the 12th and 13th centuries when the Romanesque style was influenced by Gothic trends from northern France. It was the first Gothic cathedral in Scandinavia to be built of brick, resulting in the spread of this style throughout northern Europe. With its 39 royal tombs, the cathedral is to this day the burial site for Danish monarchs. Since 1995, it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, encouraging some 100,000 tourists to visit it each year. The cathedral houses a museum on its upper floor, tracing the building&#x27;s history. A working church, it also hosts concerts throughout the year.

===Roskilde Palace===

Adjacent to the cathedral is Roskilde Palace, built from 1733 to 1736 on the site of the former residence of the bishops of Roskilde. It was used by members of the royal family when they were in the city or attended funerals. Today it houses the Museum of Contemporary Art.
During the English siege of Copenhagen in 1807, the mansion served as headquarters of General Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington. Built in the Baroque style with yellow-rendered masonry and red tile roofing, the four-winged complex consists of a two-storey main wing, two one-storey lateral wings and a curved gate wing opening onto the Stændertorvet. The four wings are connected by curving galleries. Facing the courtyard, the façade of the main wing has pilasters and a median risalit tipped by a triangular pediment decorated with the royal coat of arms.

===Roskilde Convent===

Roskilde Convent is on the site of the former St Catherine&#x27;s Priory from the mid-13th century which belonged to the Dominican friars until it was dissolved after the Danish Reformation. A private manor house (&quot;Sortebrødregaard&quot; or Blackfriars Manor) was built on the site in 1565 which in 1699 became a convent for women of high rank, the first of its kind in Lutheran Denmark. The building now houses a collection of 150 paintings from the 16th to 18th centuries as well as period furniture. The convent chapel has a carved altarpiece and pulpit.

===Roskilde Museum===

Roskilde Museum is a local history museum, run by the municipalities of Roskilde, Frederikssund and Lejre. The main branch in Roskilde, on the corner of Sankt Olsgade and Sankt Olsstræde, is based in two listed buildings, &quot;Sukkerhuset&quot; (the Sugar House) and &quot;Liebes Gård&quot; (Liebe House), a former sugar refinery and merchant&#x27;s house. The Sugar House was built by a consortium led by Johan Jørgen Holst as a facility for the processing of raw sugar from the Danish West Indies.
Jacob Borch constructed Liebe House in 1804 on the site next to the sugar factory. It replaced a modest house with timber framing and a straw roof dating from the 17th century. The building takes its name from the Liebe family who owned the property for two generations later in the century. On the occasion of his death in 1900, Liebe left the entire building complex to Roskilde Municipality. In 1908, the Sugar House came into use as a fire station. Roskilde Local History Museum was founded on 12 November 1929 on the ground floor of the Liebe House. When the fire station moved to new premises in 1989, Roskilde Museum took over the Sugar House. The museum has exhibits from prehistory, through the Viking Era and the Middle Ages to modern times. The Museum of Tools, housed in separate premises, contains a collection of tools used by craftsmen such as wheelwrights, carpenters, shoemakers and wood carvers from around 1850 to 1950.

=== Viking Ship Museum ===
A major attraction in the city is the Viking Ship Museum (&quot;Vikingeskibsmuseet&quot;) located alongside Roskilde Fjord. The centrepieces of its collection are the well-preserved remains of five 11th-century Viking ships, excavated from the fjord some north of the city in the late 1960s. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel, protecting the city, then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The five Viking ships represent several distinct classes, such as the Longship and Warship, and smaller fishing and ferry boats. The ships on display range from 10 feet (3 m) to 50 feet (15 m) in length. The museum also undertakes research in experimental archaeology centred on Viking shipbuilding and seaworthiness. The boatyard, which also forms part of the museum, safeguards the Viking boat-building tradition by building and exhibiting full-scale ships on site.

===Ragnarock Museum===
On April 29, 2016, the Ragnarock museum for pop, rock and ungdomskultur (youth culture) in Roskilde was inaugurated by Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark.
The 3,100 square-meter museum, designed by the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV and by the Danish architecture firm COBE Architects, presents and disseminates youth culture and rock music from the 1950s to the present, both as a means of communication and to enhance socialization between people from different cultures and social backgrounds.

===Historic churches===
The Old Church of Our Lady (&quot;Gammel Vor Frue Kirke&quot;) is an 11th-century stone church on the southern outskirts of the old town. It is the only surviving travertine basilica in Denmark with a high central nave opening onto two lower lateral aisles. Its carved altarpiece and pulpit from the 1620s are from Brix Michgell&#x27;s Roskilde workshop. The church was attached to a convent for women of rank until the Reformation. It has been called the &quot;Old&quot; Church of Our Lady since 1907 when a new Church of Our Lady was built to the south of the city.

There are two other historic churches in central Roskilde. St Ib&#x27;s is located below the cathedral plateau near the harbour. Built in travertine around 1100, the Romanesque building was once richly decorated in frescos, remains of which can be seen on the rear wall. It is no longer a functioning church. St Jørgensbjerg Church stands on a little hill to the northwest of the old town, overlooking the fjord. With a nave and chancel in travertine dating from c. 1080, it is Denmark&#x27;s oldest preserved stone building. It features a carved pulpit from 1616.
The Sankt Laurentii Church Tower is all that remains of the Romanesque Sankt Laurentii Church, built of travertine in the 13th century. It was torn down after the Reformation leaving only the tower which was built at the beginning of the 16th century and now forms part of the former town hall on Stændertorvet. It contains a museum where archaeological finds from 1998 can be seen.

===Roskilde Jars===

The three huge Roskilde Jars (&quot;Roskildekrukkerne&quot;) stand in a shallow water basin on the square outside the main railway station. They are in height and together weigh about 24 tons. 
The jars are the work of the Danish abstract sculptor Peter Brandes (born 1944). They were commissioned by Elsebeth Stryhn of Stryhns Leverpostej, a local meat paste company, and presented to the city in 1998 on the occasion of Roskilde&#x27;s 1,000th anniversary.

=== Roskilde Festival ===

Since it was first held in 1971, the Roskilde Festival, a rock music festival, has been held annually on the fairgrounds south of the city centre. It has grown to become one of the biggest music festivals in Scandinavia, with a turnout of around 80,000 every year. It features a diverse selection of music, including rock, metal, hip-hop, electronica, dance, and world music. All profits from the festival are donated to charities. The fairgrounds are also the site of regionally popular agricultural and animal exhibitions, and large flea markets.

==Education and sport==

Roskilde University (Danish: &quot;Roskilde Universitet, RUC&quot;) was founded in 1972. The university is on the eastern outskirts of Roskilde, in the Trekroner district (named after a signalman&#x27;s cabin on the Roskilde-Copenhagen line). RUC hosts students from around the world. Roskilde University has on-campus dormitory style housing and apartments but many students commute from Copenhagen. In 2013, there were about 7,600 students, 630 teaching staff and 380 technical and administrative personnel. Designed by Preben Hansen (1908–1989), the university buildings were first brought into use in 1972.

Founded around 1020 to educate priests for the cathedral, Roskilde Cathedral School is possibly the oldest school in Denmark. Initially located close to the cathedral, it moved into larger premises in 1969 to accommodate an increasing number of pupils (currently over 1,300). The Danish Meat Trade College (&quot;Slagteriskolen&quot;), founded in 1964, is a non-profit institution offering vocational training courses in industrial slaughter, retail butchering, sausage making, nutrition and the meat service sector. Training is also offered to kitchen staff, waiters, cooks and bakers. The school employs about 150 teachers and supporting staff. Courses are also available for international students. There is a hostel with accommodation for some 200 students.
There are eleven public primary schools in the municipality split up between eleven school districts. Six gymnasiums (including Roskilde Cathedral School and Roskilde Gymnasium) offer Upper Secondary School Exit Examinations, Higher Preparatory Examinations, Higher Commercial Examination Programme and Higher Technical Examination Programme. There are many adult education, technical and trade schools in addition to the gymnasiums. Roskilde University Library (RUB) is a research library serving the students and staff at the university.

On the sports front, Roskilde is home to the FC Roskilde football club which play in the Danish 1st Division, the country&#x27;s second highest league. Their home stadium is Roskilde Idrætspark with a capacity of 6,000. The city&#x27;s rugby club, Roskilde Vikings RK, forms part of the Vor Frue Idrætsforening which also has facilities for badminton, soccer and gymnastics. Members of the rowing club, Roskilde Roklub, have distinguished themselves at the Olympic Games and other recent championships. The Roskilde Congress &amp; Sports Centre provides facilities for sporting events accommodating up to 3,500 spectators. It is home to the Roskilde Handball Club.

In 1955 a motor racing circuit called the Roskilde Ring was built in an abandoned gravel quarry. The circuit was just 670 metres in length, being extended to 1.38 km in 1957. The circuit had no straight and all of the corners were banked. The Danish Grand Prix for Formula Two cars was held at the circuit every year from 1960 to 1968. The last meeting was held on the 22nd of September 1968, and the site is now a park.

== Transport ==
Roskilde is served by the Roskilde railway station. Its four platforms and seven tracks serve as a central hub connecting western and southern Zealand, the islands of Falster and Lolland, and Jutland to Copenhagen. Also within the municipality is the station, serving Roskilde University and the developing residential areas to the east of Roskilde. Roskilde Station is the oldest railway station in Denmark still in operation and the first to be built of stone. The first train arrived from Copenhagen on 26 June 1847.

The principal road running through Roskilde is Danish national road 21, better known as Holbæk Motorway, which connects the city to the capital in the east.

The main airport for Roskilde is Copenhagen Airport which can be reached in about 40 minutes by train. Since April 1973, there has also been the small local Roskilde Airport, serving light aircraft for training, taxi, and flight instruction. There are plans to expand it for use by larger aircraft, possibly including discount international flights. The plans were approved, but lack of commitment from any carriers has postponed progress. The airport currently handles up to 100,000 operations (flights) per year, most of which are light aircraft operations associated with school flights.
The airport is also home to a small Royal Danish Air Force detachment, maintaining a helicopter based search-and-rescue service covering Zealand and the Baltic Sea. Military passenger services have occasionally used the airport. However, there are now plans to close the military facilities in 2017 or 2018.

==Healthcare==
The principal hospital in Roskilde is Roskilde Sygehus, founded in 1855. It currently has 437 beds for in-patients and several specialist wards, having been continuously modernized and expanded over the years. Recently physics facilities have been established in medical and hematological outpatient units, while in 2010 the cardiology laboratory was expanded for CAG/PCI. In addition, in 2011 a haematological and a urological ward were modernized and re-equipped. The hospital works in conjunction with Roskilde University in biomedical research, health services research, research assignments, direct research and pharmaceutical biology. It is also involved in a scientific co-operation with the Risø Research Centre.

Sankt Hans Hospital is a psychiatric hospital located in Roskilde but operated by the Capital Region of Denmark. With a history beginning in 1620, the hospital now has 180 beds and offers specialized treatment in the areas of forensic psychiatry and dual diagnosis.

<text>Philostratus or Lucius Flavius Philostratus (; ; 170s – 240s AD), called &quot;the Athenian&quot;, was a Greek sophist of the Roman imperial period. His father was a minor sophist of the same name. He flourished during the reign of Septimius Severus (193–211) and died during that of Philip the Arab (244–249), probably in Tyre.

==Name and life==

Some ambiguity surrounds his name. The nomen &quot;Flavius&quot; is given in &quot;The Lives of the Sophists&quot; and Tzetzes. Eunapius and Synesius call him a Lemnian; Photius a Tyrian; his letters refer to him as an Athenian. His praenomen was probably &quot;Lucius&quot;, although this is not entirely confirmed.

It is probable that he was born in Lemnos, studied and taught at Athens, and then settled in Rome (where he would naturally be called &quot;Atheniensis&quot;) as a member of the learned circle with which empress Julia Domna surrounded herself.

==Works attributed to Philostratus==
Historians agree that Philostratus authored at least five works: &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot; (Τὰ ἐς τὸν Τυανέα Ἀπολλώνιον; ), &quot;Lives of the Sophists&quot; (, ), &quot;Gymnasticus&quot; (Γυμναστικός), &quot;Heroicus&quot; (Ἡρωικός) and &quot;Epistolae&quot; (Ἐπιστολαί). Another work, &quot;Imagines&quot; (Εἰκόνες), is usually assigned to his son-in-law Philostratus of Lemnos.

&quot;Heroicus&quot; (&quot;On Heroes&quot;, 213–214 AD) is in the form of a dialogue between a Phoenician traveler and a vine-tender or groundskeeper (ἀμπελουργός &quot;ampelourgos&quot;), regarding Protesilaus (or &quot;Protosilaos&quot;), the first Achaean warrior to be killed at the siege of Troy, as described in the &quot;Iliad.&quot; The dialogue extends into a discussion and critique of Homer&#x27;s presentation of heroes and gods, based on the greater authority of the dead Protosileus, who lives after death and communicates with the &quot;ampelourgos&quot;. Heroicus includes Achilles&#x27; &quot;Ode to Echo&quot;.

&quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;, written between 217 and 238 AD, tells the story of Apollonius of Tyana (c. 40 – c. 120 AD), a Pythagorean philosopher and teacher. Philostratus wrote the book for Julia Domna, wife of Septimius Severus and mother of Caracalla. The book was completed after her death.

&quot;Lives of the Sophists&quot;, written between 231 and 237 AD, is a semi-biographical history of the Greek sophists. The book is dedicated to a consul Antonius Gordianus, perhaps one of the two Gordians who were killed in 238. The work is divided into two parts: the first dealing with the ancient Sophists, e.g. Gorgias, the second with the later school, e.g. Herodes Atticus. The &quot;Lives&quot; are not in the true sense biographical, but rather picturesque impressions of leading representatives of an attitude of mind full of curiosity, alert and versatile, but lacking scientific method, preferring the external excellence of style and manner to the solid achievements of serious writing. The philosopher, as he says, investigates truth; the sophist embellishes it, and takes it for granted.

&quot;Gymnasticus&quot;, written after 220 AD, contains accounts concerning the Olympic Games and athletic contests in general.

&quot;Epistolae&quot;, or &quot;Love Letters&quot;, breathe the spirit of the New Comedy and the Alexandrine poets; portions of Letter 33 are almost literally translated in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Song to Celia&quot;, &quot;Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes.&quot; The letters are mainly of an erotic character. Their publication date is unknown.

<doc id="80292" wikidata="Q248840" url="?curid=80292" title="Hierocles of Alexandria">
<text>Hierocles of Alexandria () was a Greek Neoplatonist writer who was active around AD 430.

==Life==
He studied under Plutarch (the Neoplatonist) at Athens in the early 5th century, and taught for some years in his native city. He seems to have been banished from Alexandria and to have taken up his abode in Constantinople, where he gave an offence in the court. Damascius relates as follows:&quot;he went to Byzantium and there knocked against those in power. Taken to court, he was beaten by the blows of men. Covered in blood, he soaked the palm of his hand and sprinkled the judge, saying: &quot;Cyclops, come, drink some wine since you have eaten human flesh.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;By quoting the Odyssey (9.347), Herocles was mocking the Christian eucharist. His disciple Aeneas, a member of the Rhetorical School of Gaza, later combined neoplatonic thought with his Christian beliefs.

==Works==
The only complete work of his which has been preserved is the commentary on the &quot;Chrysa Epe&quot; (&quot;Golden Verses&quot;) of Pythagoras. It enjoyed a great reputation in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and there are numerous translations in various European languages. Several other writings, especially one on providence and fate, a consolatory treatise dedicated to his patron Olympiodorus of Thebes, are quoted or referred to by Photius and Stobaeus. Hierocles argued against astrological fatalism on the basis that it is supported by an irrational necessity rather than a divine, rational Providence of God. For the same reason, he opposed theurgic and magic practices as they were attempts to supersede the divine providential order.

Although he never mentions Christianity in his surviving works, his writings have been taken as an attempt at reconciliation between Greek religion traditions and the Christian beliefs he may have encountered in Constantinople.

The collection of some 260 witticisms attributed to Hierocles and Philagrius, the &quot;Philogelos&quot;, has no connection with Hierocles of Alexandria, but is probably a compilation of later date, founded on two older collections. It is now agreed that the fragments of the Elements of Ethics preserved in Stobaeus are from a work by a Stoic named Hierocles, contemporary of Epictetus, who has been identified with the &quot;Hierocles Stoicus vir sanctus et gravis&quot; in Aulus Gellius (ix. 5. 8). This theory is confirmed by the discovery of a papyrus (ed. H. von Arnim in Berliner Klassikertexte, Iv. 1906.)

<doc id="80293" wikidata="Q7046" url="?curid=80293" title="Botifarra">
<text>Botifarra (; ) is a type of sausage and one of the most important dishes of the Catalan cuisine.

&quot;Botifarra&quot; is based on ancient recipes, either the Roman sausage &quot;botulu&quot; or the &quot;lucanica&quot;, made of raw pork and spices, with variants today in Italy and in the Portuguese and Brazilian &quot;linguiça&quot;.

In Colombia, &quot;butifarras soledeñas&quot; are a popular tradition in Soledad, Atlántico.

==Varieties==
Some of the most representative types are:
* Raw &quot;botifarra&quot;, &quot;botifarra vermella&quot;, &quot;butifarra roja&quot;, &quot;butifarra cruda&quot;, &quot;botifarra crua&quot;, or &quot;roget&quot;. It is also known as &quot;llonganissa&quot; or &quot;longaniza&quot; in many places of the Eastern Spain. This &quot;botifarra&quot; is usually grilled or barbecued.
* Black &quot;botifarra&quot;, &quot;butifarra negra&quot; or &quot;negret&quot;, containing boiled pork blood in the mixture
* &quot;Botifarra catalana&quot;, large &quot;botifarra&quot; similar to cooked ham. It may contain truffles.
* &quot;Botifarra d&#x27;ou&quot; or &quot;butifarra de huevo&quot; (), containing egg in the mixture, typical to be eaten on Fat Thursday (dijous gras)
* White &quot;botifarra&quot;, &quot;botifarra blanca&quot; or &quot;blanquet&quot;. Its main ingredient is lean meat (&quot;carne magra&quot;). It does not contain any blood in its mixture.
* &quot;Botifarra d&#x27;arròs&quot; (), containing boiled rice together with meat and spices
* &quot;Obispo&quot; (meaning &#x27;bishop&#x27;) and &quot;bull&quot;, as well as &quot;bisbot negre&quot; and &quot;bull negre&quot;, are thick blood &quot;botifarra&quot; varieties made with different sections of tripe. Both &quot;obispo&quot; and black &quot;botifarra&quot; are versions of black pudding.

==Dishes with &quot;botifarra&quot;==
Usually white &quot;botifarra&quot; and black &quot;botifarra&quot; do not need to be cooked, but they are sometimes boiled as an ingredient of &quot;escudella i carn d&#x27;olla&quot;, a traditional dish made by boiling vegetables and meat; as well as in the Catalan way of cooking fava beans.

Grilled &quot;botifarra&quot; served with white beans ( or &quot;botifarra amb mongetes&quot;) is a typical Catalan dish.

==In Latin America==
In South America cooked &quot;botifarra&quot; of many types are known as &quot;butifarra&quot;. In the coast of Colombia, &quot;butifarra&quot; is a dried, shorter, almost round version of the sausage eaten with &quot;bollo&quot; of yuca and lime juice. In Argentina and Uruguay, &quot;butifarra&quot; is a very fatty, tender and whitish sausage much more like a cased pate, rioplatense &quot;butifarra&quot; is made with finely minced pork fat and meat that is cased in a soft sausage casing and boiled. In Paraguay, &quot;butifarra&quot; is a finely minced fatty chorizo that is commonly prepared in asado.

&quot;Butifarra&quot; is popular in El Salvador, also known to be found in Bolivia and Mexico.

In Tabasco, Mexico, &quot;la butifarra&quot; is a short sausage that is very popular with street vendors, made of seasoned mixed ground beef and pork, deep-fried and usually served with a stack of halved tortillas on each side.

===Other uses of the term===
In Peruvian cuisine, the word &quot;butifarra&quot; is used for a particular kind of ham sandwich. The Peruvian butifarra sandwich is prepared with &quot;jamon del país&quot;, which is a regional type of ham, and not a &quot;botifarra&quot; at all.

<text>Jacob Christian Jacobsen (2 September 1811 – 30 April 1887), mostly known as J. C. Jacobsen, was a Danish industrialist and philanthropist best known for founding the brewery Carlsberg.

==Biography==
He had no formal academic or scientific training (although he had attended some lectures by Hans Christian Ørsted). In the 1840s, he had come to realise that production of beer, which had until then been done in numerous small breweries, now had to be based on the scientific method in order to be industrialized.

Starting in 1847, he established his brewery Carlsberg in Valby on the outskirts of Copenhagen, on a site where it has remained since. He named the brewery after his son, Carl Jacobsen. Being extremely vigorous in the pursuit of producing high quality beer, he founded the Carlsberg Laboratory in 1875.

He took much interest in public affairs and supported the National Liberal Party – becoming gradually more conservative – both as a Member of Parliament for some periods between 1854 and 1871 and as a strong supporter of the Danish defense. He served on the Copenhagen City Council from 1843 to 1857. Moreover he was a well-known patron of the arts. After the fire of Frederiksborg Palace in 1859, he funded the reconstruction efforts.

In 1876, Jacobsen founded the Carlsberg Foundation () which he endowed with a controlling stake in Carlsberg, due to family tensions. A bitter conflict with his son Carl led to the latter&#x27;s foundation of the (New Carlsberg) Brewery 1882. A reconciliation was however obtained in 1886.

His son Carl Jacobsen collected one of the largest private art collections during his time. It is now housed in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, a museum founded by him in Copenhagen.

==Personal life==
Jacobsen was married to Laura Cathrine Holst (1819–1911) and was the father of Carl Jacobsen (1842–1919). In 1879, he became an honorary doctor of the University of Copenhagen Faculty of Science and in 1884 he was bestowed Commander 1st class of the Order of the Dannebrog, a Danish order of chivalry.

<doc id="80309" wikidata="Q385967" url="?curid=80309" title="African diaspora">
<text>The African diaspora is the worldwide collection of communities descended from people from Africa. The term most commonly refers to the descendants of the native West and Central Africans who were enslaved and shipped to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade between the 16th and 19th centuries, with their largest populations in the United States, Brazil, Colombia and Haiti. The term can also be used to refer to African descendants who immigrated to other parts of the world. Scholars identify &quot;four circulatory phases&quot; of this migration out of Africa. 

The phrase &quot;African diaspora&quot; gradually entered common usage at the turn of the 21st century. The term &quot;diaspora&quot; originates from the Greek (&quot;diaspora&quot;, &quot;scattering&quot;) which gained popularity in English in reference to the Jewish diaspora before being more broadly applied to other populations. Less commonly, the term has been used in scholarship to refer to more recent emigration from Africa. 

The African Union (AU) defines the African diaspora as consisting: &quot;of people of native or partial African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union&quot;. Its constitutive act declares that it shall &quot;invite and encourage the full participation of the African diaspora as an important part of our continent, in the building of the African Union&quot;. 

The African populations in the Americas are descended from haplogroup L genetic groups of native Africans.

== History ==
=== Dispersal through slave trade ===
Many Africans dispersed throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia during the Atlantic, Trans-Saharan, Red Sea and Indian Ocean slave trades.

The earliest recorded evidence of Africans as slaves outside of Africa comes from Ancient Greece and Rome. In the Greco-Roman world, almost all native Africans were known primarily as Aithiopians, a term that refers to the constellation of Cepheus, the King of the Sky in Greek mythology. Cepheus was the Greco mythological king of Ethiopia. The constellation Cepheus, which comes from the Greek word meaning “gardener,” is home to an important variable star, Delta Cephei, after which the Cepheid variables—stars used to estimate distances in the universe—are named. Most Aithiopian slaves in the Greco-Roman world came from Kush (modern-day Sudan), after they became prisoners of war in altercations with nearby Egypt. Archaeological evidence shows that a very small proportion of slaves in the Greco-Roman world were Aithiopian, in part due to the distance required for import. Aithiopian slaves were primarily engaged in domestic and entertainment work, leading archaeologists to believe that they were considered an expensive luxury. In one ostentatious display, the Roman Emperor Nero filled a theater with Aithiopian slaves to demonstrate the wealth and power of Rome to a visiting foreign king.

At the beginning of the 8th century, Arabs took African slaves from the central and eastern portions of the African continent (where they were known as the Zanj) and sold them into markets in the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and the Far East, for slavery in the Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid Caliphate, the Mamluk Sultanate and the Ottoman Empire. 

Beginning in the early 15th century, Europeans captured or bought African slaves from West Africa and brought them first to Europe and then, after the start of European colonization there in the late 15th century, to the Americas. The Atlantic slave trade ended in the 19th century. The dispersal through slave trading represents the largest forced migrations in human history. The economic effect on the African continent proved devastating, as generations of young people were taken from their communities and societies were disrupted. Some communities formed by descendants of African slaves in the Americas, Europe, and Asia have survived to the present day. In other cases, native Ethnic groups of Africans intermarried with non-native Africans, and their descendants blended into the local population.

In the Americas, the confluence of multiple ethnic groups from around the world contributed to multi-ethnic societies. In Central and South America, most people are descended from European, Native American, and African ancestry. In 1888, in Brazil nearly half the population descended from African slaves, the variation of physical characteristics extends across a broad range. In the United States, there was historically a greater European colonial population in relation to African slaves, especially in the Northern Tier. There was considerable racial intermarriage in colonial Virginia, and other forms of racial mixing during the slavery and post-Civil War years. Jim Crow and anti-miscegenation laws passed after the 1863–1877 Reconstruction era in the South in the late-19th century, plus waves of vastly increased immigration from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, maintained much distinction between racial groups. In the early-20th century, to institutionalize racial segregation, most southern states adopted the &quot;one drop rule&quot;, which defined and recorded anyone with any discernible African ancestry as &quot;black&quot;, even those of obvious majority native European or of majority-Native-American ancestry.
One of the results of this implementation was the loss of records of Native-identified groups, who were classified only as black because of being mixed-race.

=== Dispersal through voluntary migration ===

From the very onset of Spanish exploration and colonial activities in the Americas, Africans participated both as voluntary expeditionary and as slave laborers. Juan Garrido was such an African conquistador. He crossed the Atlantic as a freedman in the 1510s and participated in the siege of Tenochtitlan. Africans had been present in Asia and Europe long before Columbus&#x27;s travels. In the late 20th century, Africans began to emigrate to Europe and the Americas in increasing numbers, constituting new African diaspora communities not directly connected with the slave trade.

== Concepts and definitions ==

The African Union defined the African diaspora as &quot;[consisting] of people of African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union.&quot; Its constitutive act declares that it shall &quot;invite and encourage the full participation of the African diaspora as an important part of our continent, in the building of the African Union.&quot;

Between 1500 and 1900, approximately four million enslaved Africans were transported to island plantations in the Indian Ocean as part of the Indian Ocean slave trade, roughly eight million were shipped northwards as part of the Trans-Saharan slave trade, and roughly eleven million were transported to the Americas as part of the Atlantic slave trade. The diaspora that resulted from the Atlantic slave trade, specifically, may also be referred to as the black diaspora.

=== Social and political ===

Many scholars have challenged conventional views of the African diaspora as a mere dispersion of African people. For them, it is a movement of liberation that opposes the implications of racialization. Their position assumes that Africans and their descendants abroad struggle to reclaim power over their lives through voluntary migration, cultural production and political conceptions and practices. It also implies the presence of cultures of resistance with similar objectives throughout the global diaspora. Thinkers like W. E. B. Dubois and more recently Robin Kelley, for example, have argued that black politics of survival reveal more about the meaning of the African diaspora than labels of ethnicity and race, and degrees of skin hue. From this view, the daily struggle against what they call the &quot;world-historical processes&quot; of racial colonization, capitalism, and Western domination defines blacks&#x27; links to Africa.

=== African diaspora and modernity ===

In the last decades, studies on the African diaspora have shown an interest in the roles that Africans played in bringing about modernity. This trend also opposes the traditional eurocentric perspective that has dominated history books showing Africans and its diasporans as primitive victims of slavery, and without historical agency. According to historian Patrick Manning, blacks toiled at the center of forces that created the modern world. Paul Gilroy describes the suppression of blackness due to imagined and created ideals of nations as &quot;cultural insiderism&quot;. Cultural insiderism is used by nations to separate deserving and undeserving groups and requires a &quot;sense of ethnic difference&quot; as mentioned in his book &quot;The Black Atlantic&quot;. Recognizing their contributions offers a comprehensive appreciation of global history.

=== Richard Iton&#x27;s view of diaspora ===

Cultural and political theorist Richard Iton suggested that diaspora be understood as a &quot;culture of dislocation&quot;. For Iton, the traditional approach to the African diaspora focuses on the ruptures associated with the Atlantic slave trade and Middle Passage, notions of dispersal, and &quot;the cycle of retaining, redeeming, refusing, and retrieving &#x27;Africa.&#x27;&quot; This conventional framework for analyzing the diaspora is dangerous, according to Iton, because it presumes that diaspora exists outside of Africa, thus simultaneously disowning and desiring Africa. Further, Iton suggests a new starting principle for the use of diaspora: &quot;the impossibility of settlement that correlates throughout the modern period with the cluster of disturbances that trouble not only the physically dispersed but those moved without traveling.&quot; Iton adds that this impossibility of settlement—this &quot;modern matrix of strange spaces—outside the state but within the empire&quot;—renders notions of black citizenship fanciful, and in fact, &quot;undesirable&quot;. Iton argues that we citizenship, a state of statelessness thereby deconstructing colonial sites and narratives in an effort to &quot;de-link geography and power&quot;, putting &quot;&quot;all&quot; space into play&quot; (emphasis added) For Iton, diaspora&#x27;s potential is represented by a &quot;rediscursive albeit agonistic field of play that might denaturalize the hegemonic representations of modernity as unencumbered and self-generating and bring into clear view its repressed, colonial subscript&quot;.

== Populations and estimated distribution ==
African diaspora populations include:
* African Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, Afro-Latin Americans, Black Canadians – descendants of mostly enslaved West and Central Africans brought to the United States, the Caribbean, Central America and South America during the Atlantic slave trade.
* Afro-Arabs (Afro-Saudis, Afro-Omanis, Afro-Syrians, Afro-Palestinians, Afro-Iraqis, Afro-Jordanians, etc.), Afro-Iranians, Afro-Turks – descendants of Zanj slaves whose ancestors were brought to the Near East and other parts of Asia during the Indian Ocean slave trade.
* Siddis – descendants of Zanj slaves whose ancestors were brought to the Indian subcontinent (Pakistan and India). Also referred to as the Makrani in Pakistan.

== The Americas ==


* African Americans – There are an estimated 43 million people of black African descent in the United States.
* Afro-Latin Americans – An estimation from the Pew Research Center calculates about 100  million people of African descent living in Latin America. It&#x27;s important to note, however, that the racial classification criteria used in the US can differ markedly from the racial classification criteria used in other countries in the region and from how other populations perceive their own racial identification. There are also sizeable African-descended populations in Cuba, Haiti, Colombia and Dominican Republic, often with ancestry of other major ethnic groups.
* Afro-Caribbeans – The population in the Caribbean is approximately 23 million. Significant numbers of African-descended people include Haiti – 8 million, Dominican Republic – 7.9 million, and Jamaica – 2.7 million,

=== Caribbean ===
The first Africans in the Americas arrived in the region during the initial period of European colonization. In 1492, Afro-Spanish sailor Pedro Alonso Niño served as a pilot on the voyages of Christopher Columbus; though he returned to the Americas in 1499, Niño did not settle in the region. By the early 16th century, more Africans began to arrive in Spanish colonies in the Americas, sometimes as free people of color, but the majority were enslaved. Demand of African labor increased as the indigenous population of the Americas experienced a massive population decline due to the introduction of Eurasian infectious diseases (such as smallpox) to which they had no natural immunity. The Spanish Crown granted &quot;asientos&quot; (monopoly contracts) to merchants granting them the right to supply enslaved Africans in to Spanish colonies in the Americas, regulating the trade. As other European nations began establishing colonies in the Americas, these new colonies began importing enslaved Africans as well.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, most European colonies in the Caribbean operated on plantation economies fueled by slave labor, and the resulting importation of enslaved Africans meant that Afro-Caribbeans soon far outnumbered their European enslavers in terms of population. Roughly eleven to twelve million enslaved Africans were transported to the Americas as part of the transatlantic slave trade.

Beginning in 1791, the Haitian Revolution, a slave rebellion by self-emancipated slaves in the French colony of Saint-Domingue eventually led to the creation of the Republic of Haiti. The new state, led by Jean Jacques Dessalines was the first nation in the Americas to be established from a successful slave revolt and represented a challenge to the existing slave systems in the region. Continuous waves of slave rebellions, such as the Baptist War led by Samuel Sharpe in British Jamaica, created the conditions for the incremental abolition of slavery in the region, with Great Britain abolishing it in the 1830s. The Spanish colony of Cuba was the last Caribbean island to emancipate its slaves.

During the 20th century, Afro-Caribbean people began to assert their cultural, economic and political rights on the world stage. The Jamaican Marcus Garvey formed the UNIA movement in the United States, continuing with Aimé Césaire&#x27;s négritude movement, which was intended to create a pan-African movement across national lines. From the 1960s, the decolonization of the Americas led to various Caribbean countries gaining their independence from European colonial rule. They were pre-eminent in creating new cultural forms such as calypso, reggae music, and Rastafari within the Caribbean. Beyond the region, a new Afro-Caribbean diaspora, including such figures as Stokely Carmichael and DJ Kool Herc in the United States, was influential in the creation of the black power and hip hop movements. Influential political theorists such as Walter Rodney, Frantz Fanon and Stuart Hall contributed to anti-colonial theory and movements in Africa, as well as cultural developments in Europe.

=== North America ===
==== United States ====

Several migration waves to the Americas, as well as relocations within the Americas, have brought people of African descent to North America. According to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the first African populations came to North America in the 16th century via Mexico and the Caribbean to the Spanish colonies of Florida, Texas and other parts of the South. Out of the 12 million people from Africa who were shipped to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade, 645,000 were shipped to the British colonies on the North American mainland and the United States. In 2000, African Americans comprised 12.1 percent of the total population in the United States, constituting the largest racial minority group. The African-American population is concentrated in the southern states and urban areas.

In the establishment of the African diaspora, the transatlantic slave trade is often considered the defining element, but people of African descent have engaged in eleven other migration movements involving North America since the 16th century, many being voluntary migrations, although undertaken in exploitative and hostile environments.

In the 1860s, people from sub-Saharan Africa, mainly from West Africa and the Cape Verde Islands, started to arrive in a voluntary immigration wave to seek employment as whalers in Massachusetts. This migration continued until restrictive laws were enacted in 1921 that in effect closed the door on non-Europeans. By that time, men of African ancestry were already a majority in New England&#x27;s whaling industry, with African Americans working as sailors, blacksmiths, shipbuilders, officers, and owners. The internationalism of whaling crews, including the character Daggoo, an African harpooneer, is recorded in the 1851 novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. They eventually took their trade to California.

Today 1.7 million people in the United States are descended from voluntary immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, most of whom arrived in the late twentieth century. African immigrants represent 6 percent of all immigrants to the United States and almost 5 percent of the African-American community nationwide. About 57 percent immigrated between 1990 and 2000. Immigrants born in Africa constitute 1.6 percent of the black population. People of the African immigrant diaspora are the most educated population group in the United States—50 percent have bachelor&#x27;s or advanced degrees, compared to 23 percent of native-born Americans. The largest African immigrant communities in the United States are in New York, followed by California, Texas, and Maryland.

Due to the legacy of slavery in the colonial history of the United States, the average African American has a significant European component to his DNA. According to a study conducted in 2011, the African American DNA consists on average of 73.2% West African, 24% European and 0.8% Native American DNA. The European ancestry of African Americans is largely patrilineal with an estimated 19% of African American ancestors being European males, and 5% being European females. The interracial mixing occurred before the Civil War and largely in the American South, beginning during the colonial era.

The states with the highest percentages of people of African descent are Mississippi (36%), and Louisiana (33%). While not a state, the population of the District of Columbia is more than 50% black. Recent African immigrants represent a minority of black people nationwide. The U.S. Bureau of the Census categorizes the population by race based on self-identification. The census surveys have no provision for a &quot;multiracial&quot; or &quot;biracial&quot; self-identity, but since 2000, respondents may check off more than one box and claim multiple ethnicity that way.

==== Canada ====

Much of the earliest black presence in Canada came from the newly independent United States after the American Revolution; the British resettled African Americans (known as Black Loyalists) primarily in Nova Scotia. These were primarily former slaves who had escaped to British lines for promised freedom during the Revolution.

Later during the antebellum years, other individual African Americans escaped to Canada, mostly to locations in Southwestern Ontario, via the Underground Railroad, a system supported by both blacks and whites to assist fugitive slaves. After achieving independence, northern states in the U.S. had begun to abolish slavery as early as 1793, but slavery was not abolished in the South until 1865, following the American Civil War.

Black immigration to Canada in the twentieth century consisted mostly of Caribbean descent. As a result of the prominence of Caribbean immigration, the term &quot;African Canadian&quot;, while sometimes used to refer to the minority of Canadian blacks who have direct African or African-American heritage, is &quot;not&quot; normally used to denote black Canadians. Blacks of Caribbean origin are usually denoted as &quot;West Indian Canadian&quot;, &quot;Caribbean Canadian&quot; or more rarely &quot;Afro-Caribbean Canadian&quot;, but there remains no widely used alternative to &quot;Black Canadian&quot; which is considered inclusive of the African, Afro-Caribbean, and African-American black communities in Canada.

=== Central America and South America ===

At an intermediate level, in South America and in the former plantations in and around the Indian Ocean, descendants of enslaved people are a bit harder to define because many people are mixed in demographic proportion to the original slave population. In places that imported relatively few slaves (like Chile), few if any are considered &quot;black&quot; today. In places that imported many enslaved people (like Brazil or Dominican Republic), the number is larger, though most identify themselves as being of mixed, rather than strictly African, ancestry. In places like Brazil and the Dominican Republic, blackness is performed in more taboo ways than it is in, say, the United States. The idea behind Trey Ellis Cultural Mulatto comes into play as there are blurred lines between what is considered as black.

In Colombia, the African slaves were first brought to work in the gold mines of the Department of Antioquia. After this was no longer a profitable business, these slaves slowly moved to the Pacific coast, where they have remained unmixed with the white or Indian population until today. The whole Department of Chocó remains a black area. Mixture with white population happened mainly in the Caribbean coast, which is a mestizo area until today. There was also a greater mixture in the south-western departments of Cauca and Valle del Cauca. In these mestizo areas the African culture has had a great influence.

== Europe ==

Some European countries make it illegal to collect demographic census information based on ethnicity or ancestry (e.g. France), but some others do query along racial lines (e.g. the UK). Of 42 countries surveyed by a European Commission against Racism and Intolerance study in 2007, it was found that 29 collected official statistics on country of birth, 37 on citizenship, 24 on religion, 26 on language, 6 on country of birth of parents, and 22 on nationality or ethnicity.

=== France ===
Estimates of 3 to 5 million of African descent, although one quarter of the Afro-French population live in overseas territories. This number is difficult to estimate because the French census does not use race as a category for ideological reasons.

=== Germany ===
As of 2020, there were approximately 1,000,000 Afro-Germans. This number is difficult to estimate because the German census does not use race as a category.

=== Georgia ===
Some black people of unknown origin (Though perceived as Ethiopians) once inhabited southern Abkhazia; today, they have been assimilated into the Abkhaz population.

=== Italy ===
African emigrants to Italy include Italian citizens and residents originally from Africa; immigrants from Africa officially residing in Italy in 2015 numbered over 1 million residents.

=== Netherlands ===
There are an estimated 500,000 African or mixed African people in the Netherlands and the Dutch Antilles. They mainly live in the islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao and Saint Martin, the latter of which is also partly French-controlled. Many Afro-Dutch people reside in the Netherlands.

=== Portugal ===

As of 2021, there were at least 232,000 people of recent Native African immigrant background living in Portugal. They mainly live in the regions of Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra. As Portugal doesn&#x27;t collect information dealing with ethnicity, the estimate includes only people that, as of 2021, hold the citizenship of an African country or people who have acquired Portuguese citizenship from 2008 to 2021, thus excluding descendants, people of more distant African ancestry or people who have settled in Portugal generations ago and are now Portuguese citizens.

=== Romania ===
=== Spain ===
As of 2021, there were 1,206,701 Africans. They mainly live in the regions of Andalusia, Catalonia, Madrid and the Canaries.

=== United Kingdom ===
There are about 2,500,000 (4.2%) people identifying as Black British (not including British Mixed), among which are Afro-Caribbeans. They live mostly in urban areas in England.

== Eurasia ==
=== Russia ===
The first Black people in Russia were the result of the slave trade of the Ottoman Empire and their descendants still live on the coasts of the Black Sea. Czar Peter the Great was advised by his friend Lefort to bring in Africans to Russia for hard labor. Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s great-grandfather was the African princeling Abram Petrovich Gannibal, who became Peter&#x27;s protégé, was educated as a military engineer in France, and eventually became general-en-chef, responsible for the building of sea forts and canals in Russia.

During the 1930s fifteen Black American families moved to the Soviet Union as agricultural experts. As African states became independent in the 1960s, the Soviet Union offered their citizens the chance to study in Russia; over 40 years, 400,000 African students came, and some settled there.

=== Turkey ===
Afro-Turks are people of Zanj (Bantu) descent living in Turkey. Like the Afro-Abkhazians, they trace their origins to the Ottoman slave trade. Beginning several centuries ago, a number of Africans came to the Ottoman Empire, usually via Zanzibar as Zanj and from places such as present-day Niger, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Kenya and Sudan; they settled by the Dalaman, Menderes and Gediz valleys, Manavgat, and Çukurova. In the 19th century, contemporary records mention African quarters of İzmir, including Sabırtaşı, Dolapkuyu, Tamaşalık, İkiçeşmelik, and Ballıkuyu. Africans in Turkey are around 100.000 people.
== Asia ==
===South Asia===

There are a number of communities in South Asia that are descended from African slaves, traders or soldiers. These communities are the Siddi, Sheedi, Makrani and Sri Lanka Kaffirs. In some cases, they became very prominent, such as Jamal-ud-Din Yaqut, Hoshu Sheedi, Malik Ambar, or the rulers of Janjira State. The Mauritian creole people are the descendants of African slaves similar to those in the Americas.

====Siddi people====
The Siddi (), also known as the Sheedi, Sidi, Siddhi, or Habshi, are an ethnic group inhabiting India and Pakistan. Members are mostly descended from the Bantu peoples of Southeast Africa, along with Habesha immigrants. Some were merchants, sailors, indentured servants, slaves and mercenaries. The Siddi population is currently estimated at 850,000 individuals, with Karnataka, Gujarat and Telangana states in India and Makran and Karachi in Pakistan as the main population centres. Siddis are primarily Muslims, although some are Hindus and others belong to the Catholic Church.

Although often economically and socially marginalised as a community today, Siddis once ruled Bengal as the Habshi dynasty of the Bengal Sultanate, while the famous Siddi, Malik Ambar, effectively controlled the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. He played a major role, politically and militarily, in Indian history by slowing down the penetration of the Delhi-based Mughals into the Deccan Plateau of South central India.

===Southeast Asia===

Some Pan-Africanists also consider other peoples as diasporic African peoples. These groups include, among others, Negritos, such as in the case of the peoples of the Malay Peninsula (Orang Asli); New Guinea (Papuans); Andamanese; certain peoples of the Indian subcontinent, and the aboriginal peoples of Melanesia and Micronesia. Most of these claims are rejected by mainstream ethnologists as pseudoscience and pseudo-anthropology, as part of ideologically motivated Afrocentrist irredentism, touted primarily among some extremist elements in the United States who do not reflect on the mainstream African-American community. Mainstream anthropologists determine that the Andamanese and others are part of a network of autochthonous ethnic groups present in South Asia that trace their genetic ancestry to a migratory sequence that culminated in the Australian Aboriginals rather than from Africa directly. Genetic testing has shown the Andamani to belong to the Y-Chromosome Haplogroup D-M174, which is in common with Australian Aboriginals and the Ainu people of Japan rather than the actual African diaspora.

=== West Asia ===

 The Kingdom of Aksum was an ancient empire in what is now northern Ethiopia. There were four invasions and subsequent settlements of Aksumites in Himyar, located across the Red Sea in modern-day Yemen. These invasions and settlements led to one of the first large-scale African diasporas in the ancient world.

In 517 AD, the Himyarite king Ma&#x27;adikarib was overthrown by Dhu Nuwas, a Jewish leader who began persecuting Christians and confiscating trade goods between Aksum and the Byzantine Empire, both of which were Christian nations. According to the &quot;Book of the Himyarites&quot;, a man identified as Bishop Thomas journeyed to Aksum to report on the persecution of Christians in Himyar to the Aksumite Kingdom. As a result, the Aksumite king Ahayawa invaded Himyar. Dhu Nuwas fled this first invasion, and at least 580 Aksumite soldiers remained in Himyar. Himyarites who opposed Aksumite settlement united under Dhu Nuwas, and the formerly expelled king traveled back to kill the Aksumite soldiers and continue the oppression of Christians, forcing some settlers back into Aksum.

 In response to Dhu Nuwas&#x27;s Christian persecution, the new Aksumite king Kaleb first sent a group of Himyarite refugees in his Aksumite kingdom back into Himyar to stir up underground resistance against Dhu Nuwas. These discontented Himyarites then united under nobleman Sumyafa Ashwa. Kaleb successfully invaded Himyar with an Aksumite army in 525 and installed Sumyafa Ashwa to rule. More Aksumite soldiers remained in Himyar to claim land. The Byzantine ruler Justinian learned of this development and sent an ambassador, Julianus, to ally Aksum and Himyar with the Byzantine Empire against Persia. The overtures made by the Byzantine Empire to influence Himyar demonstrate that the Aksumite settlers in Himyar, due to their sustained residence and political organization, constituted a &quot;stable community in exile&quot;, which historian Carlton Wilson deems a necessary condition to classify a settlement as a diaspora. Justinian had two wishes for this proposed alliance: first, for Aksum to purchase and distribute Indian silk to the Byzantine Empire to undermine Persia economically, and second, for Aksum-ruled Himyar to invade Persia, led by the general Caisus. Both of these plans failed, as Persia&#x27;s proximity to India made the interruption of their silk trade impossible, and neither Himyar nor Aksum saw value in attacking an adversary that was both stronger and far too distant. Caisus was also responsible for killing a relative of Sumyafa Ashwa&#x27;s, making Aksumites unwilling to go into battle under him.

A third invasion was prompted by a rebellion of Aksumite soldiers between 532 and 535, led by the former slave and Aksumite commander Abreha, against Sumyafa Ashwa. Kaleb sent 3,000 soldiers to quell this rebellion, led by one of his relatives, but these soldiers joined Abreha&#x27;s rebellion upon arrival and killed Kaleb&#x27;s relative. Kaleb sent reinforcements in another attempt to end the rebellion, but his soldiers were defeated and forced to turn around. Following Kaleb&#x27;s death, Abreha paid tribute to Aksum to reinforce Himyar&#x27;s independence. The new Himyarite nation consisted of several thousand Aksumite emigrants, serving as one of the earliest examples of a large-scale movement of tropical Africans outside of the continent. Just a century later, Aksum&#x27;s relationship to this southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula would be pivotal to the introduction of Islam at Mecca and Yathrib (Medina), as evidenced by the naming of Bilal, an Ethiopian, as the first muezzin, and the flight of some of Muhammad&#x27;s earliest followers from Mecca to Askum.

== Music and the African diaspora ==

Although fragmented and separated by land and water, the African Diaspora maintains connection through the use of music. This link between the various sects of the African Diaspora is termed by Paul Gilroy as The Black Atlantic. The Black Atlantic is possible because black people have a shared history rooted in oppression that is displayed in Black genres such as rap and reggae. The linkages within the black diaspora formulated through music allows consumers of music and artists to pull from different cultures to combine and create a conglomerate of experiences that reaches across the world.

<doc id="80312" wikidata="Q471007" url="?curid=80312" title="UAE (emulator)">
<text>UAE is a computer emulator which emulates the hardware of Commodore International&#x27;s Amiga range of computers. Released under the GNU General Public License, UAE is free software.

==History==
Bernd Schmidt conceived of an emulator that can run Amiga software when he found that such a task was widely believed to be impossible. Schmidt had written previous programs for Amiga, and was further motivated by the desire to not lose games, demos, and sound modules to switching operating systems. UAE was released in 1995 and was originally called the &quot;Unusable Amiga Emulator&quot;, due to its inability to boot. In its early stages, it was known as &quot;Unix Amiga Emulator&quot; and later with other names as well. Today the name stands for &quot;Universal Amiga Emulator&quot;.

== Features ==
UAE is almost a full-featured Amiga emulator. It emulates most of its functions:

* Original Chip Set (OCS), Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) and Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA)
* I/O devices: (floppy disk drives, joystick, mouse and serial ports)
* Processor: Motorola 68000/010/020/040 CPU, optionally a 68881 FPU, and as of WinUAE 3.0.0 beta 15, an enhanced PowerPC JIT core using the QEMU CPU libraries.
* Memory: 2 MB Chip RAM and 8 MB Fast RAM, or 8 MB Chip RAM without Fast RAM. 64 MB Zorro III Fast RAM, independent of Chip RAM setting (68020+ only). 1 MB Slow RAM, for compatibility.
* Picasso 96 graphics with 8 MB of memory
* Serial port, and Simple parallel port is only sufficient for printing.
* Networking via bsdsocket.library emulation

For software, UAE may use disk images made from original Amiga floppy disks. These images have the file extension of &quot;ADF&quot; (Amiga Disk File). Actual Amiga disks cannot be used, because of limitations in the floppy controllers used in other computers.
Images of Amiga formatted hard drives can also be made. UAE also supports mapping host operating system&#x27;s directories to Amiga hard drives, and finally, physical Amiga formatted hard drives can be mounted.

UAE does not include the original Amiga operating system ROM and files, which are required for running an Amiga system. These are included under license in packages like Amiga Forever. Original Kickstart 3.1 ROM images are also included with AmigaOS4 for PowerPC since version 4.1 Update 4. UAE also supports alternative system ROMs, such as those derived from the AROS project, however these do not provide the same degree of software compatibility as the original ROMs.

==Portability==
UAE has been ported to many host operating systems, including Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, DOS, Microsoft Windows, RISC OS, BeOS, Palm OS, Android, the Xbox console, the PSP, PSVita and GP2X handhelds, iOS, the Wii and Dreamcast consoles, and even to AmigaOS, MorphOS and AROS.

==Emulation speed==
There have been many threads in the past on Usenet and other public forums where people argued about the possibility of writing an Amiga emulator. Some considered UAE to be attempting the impossible; to be demanding that a system read, process and output 100 MB/s of data when the fastest PC was a 66 MHz 486, while keeping various emulated chips (the Amiga chipset) all in sync and appearing as they were supposed to appear to software.

UAE was almost entirely unusable in its first releases, but slowly and step by step, it fleshed out its support of the Amiga chipset and by the end of 1997 was able to emulate an Amiga 500 at a quality and speed that were sufficient for productivity use and for many games.

Since then, UAE has been usable, thanks partly to the effort taken to develop it and partly to the big improvements in technology that brought computers many times faster than those UAE was initially running on. Many Amiga games and applications can run smoothly on a Pentium II-era system. The realization that a useful Amiga emulator could be written contributed to an increase in enthusiasm about emulation, which started or sped-up efforts to write emulators for other and often less popular computer and electronic game architectures.

A major improvement was made in 2000 by Bernd Meyer with the use of Just-in-time compilation, which significantly improved the emulation speed, to the extent that average PCs could now emulate some Amiga software faster than any real Amiga could run it. UAE can use as much of the host&#x27;s power in native mode as possible, or balance it with other requirements of the host OS, or to accurately reflect the original speed, depending on a user&#x27;s choice. UAE also provides an RTG-compatible &quot;video card&quot; for the Amiga side of the emulation which is tailored for display on the host hardware, so as not to be limited to the emulation of the original Amiga video hardware.
==Project development==
There are six main forks of the original program:

* WinUAE, designed to run on Windows, ported by Mathias Ortmann and currently developed by Toni Wilen
* PUAE, designed to run on Unix platforms (continuation of the abandoned E-UAE and also a port of WinUAE) 
* FS-UAE, designed to run on Windows, macOS and Linux (a port of WinUAE with a focus on emulating games, featuring a new on-screen GUI and cross-platform online play)
* UAE4all, a stripped and optimized version, designed to emulate an OCS Amiga on low-end devices. UAE4all2 add AGA and hard disk support.
* Scripted Amiga Emulator (SAE), designed to run in a modern browser using JavaScript and HTML5. It is also based on WinUAE and was released on 1. September 2012 by Rupert Hausberger. SAE needs a very fast computer to run on.
*UAE4ARM, designed to run on ARM devices including the Raspberry Pi. It&#x27;s the only fork supporting Just-In-Time on ARM devices. Others supported platforms are Pandora, Android and libretro.

The most active fork is WinUAE; current versions of this still contain bugs and compatibility issues. 

Specific versions:


== See also ==
* Amiga Forever, Amiga emulator
* Basilisk II, Apple Macintosh emulator which uses UAE to emulate the 68k processor
* Hatari, Atari ST/STe/TT/Falcon computer series emulator which uses UAE for the core m68k emulation
* Previous, NeXT computer emulator, derived from Hatari
* Fellow, another Amiga emulator which was released not too long after the first usable versions of UAE, and generated competition beneficial to both projects.
* POSE, Palm OS emulator that is based on Copilot, which in turn was based on UAE&#x27;s m68k emulation

<doc id="80313" wikidata="Q38283" url="?curid=80313" title="Yokohama">
<text>is the second-largest city in Japan by population as well as by area, and the country&#x27;s most populous municipality. It is the capital and most populous city in Kanagawa Prefecture, with a population of 3.7 million in 2023. It lies on Tokyo Bay, south of Tokyo, in the Kantō region of the main island of Honshu. Yokohama is also the major economic, cultural, and commercial hub of the Greater Tokyo Area along the Keihin Industrial Zone.

Yokohama was one of the cities to open for trade with the West following the 1859 end of the policy of seclusion and has since been known as a cosmopolitan port city, after Kobe opened in 1853. Yokohama is the home of many Japan&#x27;s firsts in the Meiji period, including the first foreign trading port and Chinatown (1859), European-style sport venues (1860s), English-language newspaper (1861), confectionery and beer manufacturing (1865), daily newspaper (1870), gas-powered street lamps (1870s), railway station (1872), and power plant (1882). Yokohama developed rapidly as Japan&#x27;s prominent port city following the end of Japan&#x27;s relative isolation in the mid-19th century and is today one of its major ports along with Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, Tokyo and Chiba.

Yokohama is the largest port city and high tech industrial hub in the Greater Tokyo Area and the Kantō region. The city proper is headquarters to companies such as Isuzu, Nissan, JVCKenwood, Keikyu, Koei Tecmo, Sotetsu and Bank of Yokohama. Famous landmarks in Yokohama include Minato Mirai 21, Nippon Maru Memorial Park, Yokohama Chinatown, Motomachi Shopping Street, Yokohama Marine Tower, Yamashita Park, and Ōsanbashi Pier.

==Etymology==
Yokohama (横浜) means &quot;horizontal beach&quot;. The current area surrounded by Maita Park, the Ōoka River and the Nakamura River have been a gulf divided by a sandbar from the open sea. This sandbar was the original Yokohama fishing village. Since the sandbar protruded perpendicularly from the land, or horizontally when viewed from the sea, it was called a &quot;horizontal beach&quot;.

==History==
===Opening of the Treaty Port (1859–1868)===
Before the Europeans arrived, Yokohama was a small fishing village up to the end of the feudal Edo period, when Japan held a policy of national seclusion, having little contact with foreigners. A major turning point in Japanese history happened in 1853–54, when Commodore Matthew Perry arrived just south of Yokohama with a fleet of American warships, demanding that Japan open several ports for commerce, and the Tokugawa shogunate agreed by signing the Treaty of Peace and Amity.

It was initially agreed that one of the ports to be opened to foreign ships would be the town of Kanagawa-juku (in what is now Kanagawa Ward) on the Tōkaidō, a strategic highway that linked Edo to Kyoto and Osaka. However, the Tokugawa shogunate decided that Kanagawa-juku was too close to the Tōkaidō for comfort, and port facilities were instead built across the inlet in the fishing village of Yokohama. The Port of Yokohama was officially opened on June 2, 1859.

Yokohama quickly became the base of foreign trade in Japan. Foreigners initially occupied the low-lying district of the city called Kannai, residential districts later expanding as the settlement grew to incorporate much of the elevated Yamate district overlooking the city, commonly referred to by English-speaking residents as &quot;The Bluff&quot;. Under pressure from United States and United Kingdom officials, the Tokugawa government built a commercial sex district which opened on November 10, 1859, with 6 brothels and 200 indentured sex workers. The area of Yokohama with the highest concentration of brothels was known as Bloodtown.

Kannai, the foreign trade and commercial district (literally, &quot;inside the barrier&quot;), was surrounded by a moat, foreign residents enjoying extraterritorial status both within and outside the compound. Interactions with the local population, particularly young samurai, outside the settlement inevitably caused problems; the Namamugi Incident, one of the events that preceded the downfall of the shogunate, took place in what is now Tsurumi Ward in 1862, and prompted the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863.

To protect British commercial and diplomatic interests in Yokohama a military garrison was established in 1862. With the growth in trade increasing numbers of Chinese also came to settle in the city. Yokohama was the scene of many notable firsts for Japan including the growing acceptance of western fashion, photography by pioneers such as Felice Beato, Japan&#x27;s first English language newspaper, the &quot;Japan Herald&quot; published in 1861 and in 1865 the first ice cream confectionery and beer to be produced in Japan. Recreational sports introduced to Japan by foreign residents in Yokohama included European style horse racing in 1862, cricket in 1863 and rugby union in 1866. A great fire destroyed much of the foreign settlement on November 26, 1866, and smallpox was a recurrent public health hazard, but the city continued to grow rapidly – attracting foreigners and Japanese alike.
===Meiji and Taisho periods (1868–1923)===
After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the port was developed for trading silk, the main trading partner being Great Britain. Western influence and technological transfer contributed to the establishment of Japan&#x27;s first daily newspaper (1870), first gas-powered street lamps (1872) and Japan&#x27;s first railway constructed in the same year to connect Yokohama to Shinagawa and Shinbashi in Tokyo. In 1872 Jules Verne portrayed Yokohama, which he had never visited, in an episode of his widely read novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, capturing the atmosphere of the fast-developing, internationally oriented Japanese city.

In 1887, a British merchant, Samuel Cocking, built the city&#x27;s first power plant. At first for his own use, this coal power plant became the basis for the Yokohama Cooperative Electric Light Company. The city was officially incorporated on April 1, 1889. By the time the extraterritoriality of foreigner areas was abolished in 1899, Yokohama was the most international city in Japan, with foreigner areas stretching from Kannai to the Bluff area and the large Yokohama Chinatown.

The early 20th century was marked by rapid growth of industry. Entrepreneurs built factories along reclaimed land to the north of the city toward Kawasaki, which eventually grew to be the Keihin Industrial Area. The growth of Japanese industry brought affluence, and many wealthy trading families constructed sprawling residences there, while the rapid influx of population from Japan and Korea also led to the formation of Kojiki-Yato, then the largest slum in Japan.
===Great Kantō earthquake and the Second World War (1923–1945)===

Much of Yokohama was destroyed on September 1, 1923, by the Great Kantō earthquake. The Yokohama police reported casualties at 30,771 dead and 47,908 injured, out of a pre-earthquake population of 434,170. Fuelled by rumors of rebellion and sabotage, vigilante mobs thereupon murdered many Koreans in the Kojiki-yato slum. Many people believed that Koreans used black magic to cause the earthquake. Martial law was in place until November 19. Rubble from the quake was used to reclaim land for parks, the most famous being the Yamashita Park on the waterfront which opened in 1930.

Yokohama was rebuilt, only to be destroyed again by U.S. air raids during World War II. The first bombing was in the April 18, 1942 Doolittle Raid. An estimated 7,000–8,000 people were killed in a single morning on May 29, 1945, in what is now known as the Great Yokohama Air Raid, when B-29s firebombed the city and in just one hour and nine minutes, reducing 42% of it to rubble.

===Postwar growth and development===

During the American occupation, Yokohama was a major transshipment base for American supplies and personnel, especially during the Korean War. After the occupation, most local U.S. naval activity moved from Yokohama to an American base in nearby Yokosuka.

Four years after the Treaty of San Francisco signed, the city was designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956. The city&#x27;s tram and trolleybus system was abolished in 1972, the same year as the opening of the first line of Yokohama Municipal Subway. Construction of Minato Mirai 21 (&quot;Port Future 21&quot;), a major urban development project on reclaimed land started in 1983, nicknamed the &quot;Philadelphia and Boston of the Orient&quot; was compared to Center City, Philadelphia and Downtown Boston located in the East Coast of the United States. Minato Mirai 21 hosted the Yokohama Exotic Showcase in 1989, which saw the first public operation of maglev trains in Japan and the opening of Cosmo Clock 21, then the tallest Ferris wheel in the world. The Yokohama Bay Bridge opened in the same year. In 1993, Minato Mirai 21 saw the opening of the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the second-tallest building in Japan.

The 2002 FIFA World Cup final was held in June at the International Stadium Yokohama. In 2009, the city marked the 150th anniversary of the opening of the port and the 120th anniversary of the commencement of the City Administration. An early part in the commemoration project incorporated the Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV), which was held in Yokohama in May 2008. In November 2010, Yokohama hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.

== Geography ==
===Topography===
Yokohama has a total area of at an elevation of above sea level. It is the capital of Kanagawa Prefecture, bordered to the east by Tokyo Bay and located in the middle of the Kantō plain. The city is surrounded by hills and the characteristic mountain system of the island of Honshū, so its growth has been limited and it has had to gain ground from the sea. This also affects the population density, one of the highest in Japan with 8,500 inhabitants per km2.

The highest points within the urban boundary are Omaruyama () and Mount Enkaizan (). The main river is the Tsurumi River, which begins in the Tama Hills and empties into the Pacific Ocean.

These municipalities surround Yokohama: Kawasaki, Yokosuka, Zushi, Kamakura, Fujisawa, Yamato, Machida.

===Geology===
The city is very prone to natural phenomena such as earthquakes and tropical cyclones because the island of Honshū has a high level of seismic activity, being in the middle of the Pacific Ring of Fire.

Most seismic movements are of low intensity and are generally not perceived by people. However, Yokohama has experienced two major tremors that reflect the evolution of Earthquake engineering: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake devastated the city and caused more than 100,000 fatalities throughout the region, while the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, with its epicenter on the east coast, was felt in the locality but only material damage was lamented because most buildings were already prepared to withstand them.

===Climate===
Yokohama features a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot, humid summers and chilly winters. Weatherwise, Yokohama has a pattern of rain, clouds and sun, although in winter, it is surprisingly sunny, more so than Southern Spain. Winter temperatures rarely drop below freezing, while summer can seem quite warm, because of the effects of humidity. The coldest temperature was on 24 January 1927 when was reached, whilst the hottest day was 11 August 2013 at . The highest monthly rainfall was in October 2004 with , closely followed by July 1941 with , whilst December and January have recorded no measurable precipitation three times each.

==Demographics==
The city&#x27;s population is 3,772,726 as of 1 June 2024, making it the second-most populated city in the country after Tokyo&#x27;s 23 special wards. Among Yokohama&#x27;s 18 wards, the most inhabited was Kohoku with a population of 364,760, followed by Aoba (308,379), Tsurumi (297,230), and Totsuka (282,601). In terms of population density, Nishi and Minami are the most densely populated, with a per square kilometre population exceeding 15,000. Of Yokohama&#x27;s population, 1,548,077 work outside the city, while 1,226,618 workers commute from outside the city. As these numbers suggest, some of Yokohama&#x27;s residential areas are commuter suburbs (or &quot;bed towns&quot; as known in Japanese) for those who work in other major cities, primarily Tokyo.

=== Immigration ===
As of June 2024, Yokohama&#x27;s population includes 121,042 foreign nationals, making up 3.2% of the total population, with the number having grown significantly in recent years. While all three countries with the number of nationals living in Yokohama as citizens exceeding 10,000 are all in Asia (China, South Korea, Vietnam), other major countries of origin for Yokohama&#x27;s non-Japanese residents include Brazil (2,823), the United States (2,793), Peru (1,312), the United Kingdom (840), and Germany (770). There is no official survey of the citizens&#x27; countries of birth, hence these numbers do not include naturalized citizens, but they include foreign nationals born outside their country of citizenship.

==Administration==
=== Municipal adminsitration ===
Yokohama is one of the 20 designated cities in the country, which means the city has many powers that usually belong to prefectural governments, while having wards as subdivisions with administrative functions. Yokohama city consists of 18 wards, with its government seat in Naka Ward. The Yokohama City Council consists of 86 members elected from a total of 18 Wards. The LDP has minority control with 36 seats. The incumbent mayor is Takeharu Yamanaka, who defeated his predecessor Fumiko Hayashi in the 2021 Yokohama mayoral election.

===Wards===
Yokohama has 18 wards (&quot;ku&quot;):
== Economy ==
In 2020, Yokohama&#x27;s total gross regional product was 14.06 trillion yen or US$133 billion, a 1.9 per cent decrease compared to the previous year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This converts to US$35,107 per citizen, below the national average. A large number of Yokohama&#x27;s citizens work outside the city (693,064 in 2020), primarily in Tokyo, and the economic value they generate outside the city does not contribute to Yokohama&#x27;s economic output. The largest contributors to this figure were wholesale and retail (17.8%), healthcare (11.7%), and academic, professional, or technological services (11.0%).

<text>Lev Davidovich Landau (; 22 January 1908 – 1 April 1968) was a Soviet physicist who made fundamental contributions to many areas of theoretical physics. He was considered as one of the last scientists who were universally well-versed and made seminal contributions to all branches of physics. He is credited with laying the foundations of twentieth century condensed matter physics, and is also considered arguably the greatest Soviet theoretical physicist.

His accomplishments include the independent co-discovery of the density matrix method in quantum mechanics (alongside John von Neumann), the quantum mechanical theory of diamagnetism, the theory of superfluidity, the theory of second-order phase transitions, invention of order parameter technique, the Ginzburg–Landau theory of superconductivity, the theory of Fermi liquids, the explanation of Landau damping in plasma physics, the Landau pole in quantum electrodynamics, the two-component theory of neutrinos, and Landau&#x27;s equations for &quot;S&quot;-matrix singularities. He received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physics for his development of a mathematical theory of superfluidity that accounts for the properties of liquid helium II at a temperature below ().

==Life==

===Early years===
Landau was born on 22 January 1908 to Jewish parents in Baku, the Russian Empire, in what is now Azerbaijan. Landau&#x27;s father, David Lvovich Landau, was an engineer with the local oil industry, and his mother, Lyubov Veniaminovna Garkavi-Landau, was a doctor. Both came to Baku from Mogilev and both graduated the Mogilev gymnasium. He learned differential calculus at age 12 and integral calculus at age 13. Landau graduated in 1920 at age 13 from gymnasium. His parents considered him too young to attend university, so for a year he attended the Baku Economical Technical School. In 1922, at age 14, he matriculated at the Baku State University, studying in two departments simultaneously: the Departments of Physics and Mathematics, and the Department of Chemistry. Subsequently, he ceased studying chemistry, but remained interested in the field throughout his life.

===Leningrad and Europe===
In 1924, he moved to the main centre of Soviet physics at the time: the Physics Department of Leningrad State University, where he dedicated himself to the study of theoretical physics, graduating in 1927. Landau subsequently enrolled for post-graduate studies at the Leningrad Physico-Technical Institute where he eventually received a doctorate in Physical and Mathematical Sciences in 1934. Landau got his first chance to travel abroad during the period 1929–1931, on a Soviet government—People&#x27;s Commissariat for Education—travelling fellowship supplemented by a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship. By that time he was fluent in German and French and could communicate in English. He later improved his English and learned Danish.

After brief stays in Göttingen and Leipzig, he went to Copenhagen on 8 April 1930 to work at the Niels Bohr&#x27;s Institute for Theoretical Physics. He stayed there until 3 May of the same year. After the visit, Landau always considered himself a pupil of Niels Bohr and Landau&#x27;s approach to physics was greatly influenced by Bohr. After his stay in Copenhagen, he visited Cambridge (mid-1930), where he worked with Paul Dirac, Copenhagen (September to November 1930), and Zürich (December 1930 to January 1931), where he worked with Wolfgang Pauli. From Zürich Landau went back to Copenhagen for the third time and stayed there from 25 February until 19 March 1931 before returning to Leningrad the same year.

===National Scientific Center Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, Kharkiv===
Between 1932 and 1937, Landau headed the Department of Theoretical Physics at the National Scientific Center Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, and he lectured at the University of Kharkiv and the Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute. Apart from his theoretical accomplishments, Landau was the principal founder of a great tradition of theoretical physics in Kharkiv, Ukraine, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Landau school&quot;. In Kharkiv, he and his friend and former student, Evgeny Lifshitz, began writing the &quot;Course of Theoretical Physics&quot;, ten volumes that together span the whole of the subject and are still widely used as graduate-level physics texts. During the Great Purge, Landau was investigated within the UPTI Affair in Kharkiv, but he managed to leave for Moscow to take up a new post.

Landau developed a famous comprehensive exam called the &quot;Theoretical Minimum&quot; which students were expected to pass before admission to the school. The exam covered all aspects of theoretical physics, and between 1934 and 1961 only 43 candidates passed, but those who did later became quite notable theoretical physicists.

In 1932, Landau computed the Chandrasekhar limit; however, he did not apply it to white dwarf stars.

===Institute for Physical Problems, Moscow===
From 1937 until 1962, Landau was the head of the Theoretical Division at the Institute for Physical Problems.

On 27 April 1938, Landau was arrested for the possession of a leaflet which compared Stalinism to German Nazism and Italian Fascism. He was held in the NKVD&#x27;s Lubyanka prison until his release, on 29 April 1939, after Pyotr Kapitsa (an experimental low-temperature physicist and the founder and head of the institute) and Bohr wrote letters to Joseph Stalin. Kapitsa personally vouched for Landau&#x27;s behaviour and threatened to quit the institute if Landau was not released. After his release, Landau discovered how to explain Kapitsa&#x27;s superfluidity using sound waves, or phonons, and a new excitation called a roton.

Landau led a team of mathematicians supporting Soviet atomic and hydrogen bomb development. He calculated the dynamics of the first Soviet thermonuclear bomb, including predicting the yield. For this work Landau received the Stalin Prize in 1949 and 1953, and was awarded the title &quot;Hero of Socialist Labour&quot; in 1954.

Landau&#x27;s students included Lev Pitaevskii, Alexei Abrikosov, Aleksandr Akhiezer, Igor Dzyaloshinskii, Evgeny Lifshitz, Lev Gor&#x27;kov, Isaak Khalatnikov, Roald Sagdeev and Isaak Pomeranchuk.

===Scientific achievements===
Landau&#x27;s accomplishments include the independent co-discovery of the density matrix method in quantum mechanics (alongside John von Neumann), the quantum mechanical theory of diamagnetism, the theory of superfluidity, the theory of second-order phase transitions, the Ginzburg–Landau theory of superconductivity, the theory of Fermi liquids, the explanation of Landau damping in plasma physics, the Landau pole in quantum electrodynamics, the two-component theory of neutrinos, the explanation of flame instability (the Darrieus-Landau instability), and Landau&#x27;s equations for S matrix singularities.

Landau received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physics for his development of a mathematical theory of superfluidity that accounts for the properties of liquid helium II at a temperature below 2.17 K (−270.98 °C).&quot;

In 1937, Landau married Kora T. Drobanzeva from Kharkiv. Their son Igor (1946–2011) became a theoretical physicist. Lev Landau believed in &quot;free love&quot; rather than monogamy and encouraged his wife and his students to practise &quot;free love&quot;. However, his wife was not enthusiastic.

Landau is generally described as an atheist, although when Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky asked Landau whether he believed in the existence of God, Landau pondered the matter in silence for three minutes before responding, &quot;I think so.&quot; In 1957, a lengthy report to the CPSU Central Committee by the KGB recorded Landau&#x27;s views on the 1956 Hungarian Uprising, Vladimir Lenin and what he termed &quot;red fascism&quot;. Hendrik Casimir recalls him as a passionate communist, emboldened by his revolutionary ideology. Landau&#x27;s drive in establishing Soviet science was in part due to his devotion to socialism. In 1935 he published a piece titled “Bourgeoisie and Contemporary Physics” in the Soviet newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot; in which he criticized religious superstition and the dominance of capital, which he saw as bourgeois tendencies, citing “unprecedented opportunities for the development of physics in our country, provided by the Party and the government.” 

===Last years===
On 7 January 1962, Landau&#x27;s car collided with an oncoming truck. He was severely injured and spent two months in a coma. Although Landau recovered in many ways, his scientific creativity was destroyed, and he never returned fully to scientific work. His injuries prevented him from accepting the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physics in person.

Throughout his life Landau was known for his sharp humour, as illustrated by the following dialogue with a psychologist, Alexander Luria, who tried to test for possible brain damage while Landau was recovering from the car crash:
:Luria: &quot;Please draw me a circle&quot;
:Landau draws a cross
:Luria: &quot;Hm, now draw me a cross&quot;
:Landau draws a circle
:Luria: &quot;Landau, why don&#x27;t you do what I ask?&quot;
:Landau: &quot;If I did, you might come to think I&#x27;ve become mentally retarded&quot;.

In 1965 former students and co-workers of Landau founded the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, located in the town of Chernogolovka near Moscow, and led for the following three decades by Isaak Khalatnikov.

In June 1965, Lev Landau and Evsei Liberman published a letter in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, stating that as Soviet Jews they opposed U.S. intervention on behalf of the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry. However, there are doubts that Landau authored this letter.

===Death===
Landau died on 1 April 1968, aged 60, from complications of the injuries sustained in the car accident six years earlier. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

==Legacy==

Two celestial objects are named in his honour:
*the minor planet 2142 Landau.
*the lunar crater Landau.
The highest prize in theoretical physics awarded by the Russian Academy of Sciences is named in his honour:
*Landau Gold Medal

On 22 January 2019, Google celebrated what would have been Landau&#x27;s 111th birthday with a Google Doodle.

The Landau-Spitzer Award (American Physical Society), which recognizes outstanding contributions to plasma physics and European-United States collaboration, is named in-part in his honor.

==Landau&#x27;s ranking of physicists==

Landau kept a list of names of physicists which he ranked on a logarithmic scale of productivity and genius, such as creativity and innate talent, ranging from 0 to 5. The highest ranking, 0, was assigned to Isaac Newton. Albert Einstein was ranked 0.5. A rank of 1 was awarded to the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Satyendra Nath Bose, Paul Dirac and Erwin Schrödinger, and others, while members of rank of 5 were deemed &quot;pathologists&quot;. Landau ranked himself as a 2.5 but later promoted to a 2. N. David Mermin, writing about Landau, referred to the scale, and ranked himself in the fourth division, in the article &quot;My Life with Landau: Homage of a 4.5 to a 2&quot;.

Landau had a lesser known scale to measure the genius of a scientist using diagrams instead. He had four classes of diagrams, with the first being a simple triangle, which included those who were the most original and brilliant, such as Dirac and Einstein. The diagrams were formed by two parallel lines, bottom representing tenacity, while the top measured genius and originality.

==In popular culture==
* The Russian television film &quot;My Husband — the Genius&quot; (translation of the Russian title &quot;Мой муж — гений&quot;) released in 2008 tells the biography of Landau (played by Daniil Spivakovsky), mostly focusing on his private life. It was generally panned by critics. People who had personally met Landau, including famous Russian scientist Vitaly Ginzburg, said that the film was not only terrible, but also false in historical facts.
* Another film about Landau, &quot;Dau&quot;, is directed by Ilya Khrzhanovsky with non-professional actor Teodor Currentzis (an orchestra conductor) as Landau. Dau was a common nickname of Lev Landau. The film was part of the multidisciplinary art project &quot;DAU&quot;.

==Works==

Landau wrote his first paper &quot;On the derivation of Klein–Fock equation&quot;, co-authored with Dmitri Ivanenko in 1926, when he was 18 years old. His last paper titled &quot;Fundamental problems&quot; appeared in 1960 in an edited version of tributes to Wolfgang Pauli. A complete list of Landau&#x27;s works appeared in 1998 in the Russian journal &quot;Physics-Uspekhi&quot;. Landau would allow himself to be listed as a co-author of a journal article on two conditions: 1) he brought up the idea of the work, partly or entirely, and 2) he performed at least some calculations presented in the article. Consequently, he removed his name from numerous publications of his students where his contribution was less significant.

Landau and Lifshitz suggested in the third volume of the &quot;Course of Theoretical Physics&quot; that the then-standard periodic table had a mistake in it, and that lutetium should be regarded as a d-block rather than an f-block element. Their suggestion was fully vindicated by later findings, and in 1988 was endorsed by a report of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).

<text>New Keynesian economics is a school of macroeconomics that strives to provide microeconomic foundations for Keynesian economics. It developed partly as a response to criticisms of Keynesian macroeconomics by adherents of new classical macroeconomics.

Two main assumptions define the New Keynesian approach to macroeconomics. Like the New Classical approach, New Keynesian macroeconomic analysis usually assumes that households and firms have rational expectations. However, the two schools differ in that New Keynesian analysis usually assumes a variety of market failures. In particular, New Keynesians assume that there is imperfect competition in price and wage setting to help explain why prices and wages can become &quot;sticky&quot;, which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions.

Wage and price stickiness, and the other present descriptions of market failures in New Keynesian models, imply that the economy may fail to attain full employment. Therefore, New Keynesians argue that macroeconomic stabilization by the government (using fiscal policy) and the central bank (using monetary policy) can lead to a more efficient macroeconomic outcome than a &quot;laissez faire&quot; policy would.

New Keynesianism became part of the new neoclassical synthesis that incorporated parts of both it and new classical macroeconomics, and forms the theoretical basis of mainstream macroeconomics today.

==Development of New Keynesian economics==

===1970s===
The first wave of New Keynesian economics developed in the late 1970s. The first model of &quot;Sticky information&quot; was developed by Stanley Fischer in his 1977 article, &quot;Long-Term Contracts, Rational Expectations, and the Optimal Money Supply Rule&quot;. He adopted a &quot;staggered&quot; or &quot;overlapping&quot; contract model. Suppose that there are two unions in the economy, who take turns to choose wages. When it is a union&#x27;s turn, it chooses the wages it will set for the next two periods. This contrasts with John B. Taylor&#x27;s model where the nominal wage is constant over the contract life, as was subsequently developed in his two articles: one in 1979, &quot;Staggered wage setting in a macro model&quot;, and one in 1980, &quot;Aggregate Dynamics and Staggered Contracts&quot;. Both Taylor and Fischer contracts share the feature that only the unions setting the wage in the current period are using the latest information: wages in half of the economy still reflect old information. The Taylor model had sticky nominal wages in addition to the sticky information: nominal wages had to be constant over the length of the contract (two periods). These early new Keynesian theories were based on the basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus affect the employment rate.

===1980s===

====Menu costs and imperfect competition====

In the 1980s the key concept of using menu costs in a framework of imperfect competition to explain price stickiness was developed. The concept of a lump-sum cost (menu cost) to changing the price was originally introduced by Sheshinski and Weiss (1977) in their paper looking at the effect of inflation on the frequency of price-changes. The idea of applying it as a general theory of nominal price rigidity was simultaneously put forward by several economists in 1985–86. George Akerlof and Janet Yellen put forward the idea that due to bounded rationality firms will not want to change their price unless the benefit is more than a small amount. This bounded rationality leads to inertia in nominal prices and wages which can lead to output fluctuating at constant nominal prices and wages. Gregory Mankiw took the menu-cost idea and focused on the welfare effects of changes in output resulting from sticky prices. Michael Parkin also put forward the idea. Although the approach initially focused mainly on the rigidity of nominal prices, it was extended to wages and prices by Olivier Blanchard and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki in their influential article &quot;Monopolistic Competition and the Effects of Aggregate Demand&quot;. Huw Dixon and Claus Hansen showed that even if menu costs applied to a small sector of the economy, this would influence the rest of the economy and lead to prices in the rest of the economy becoming less responsive to changes in demand.

While some studies suggested that menu costs are too small to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence M. Ball and David Romer showed in 1990 that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm&#x27;s costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.

Even if prices are perfectly flexible, imperfect competition can affect the influence of fiscal policy in terms of the multiplier. Huw Dixon and Gregory Mankiw developed independently simple general equilibrium models showing that the fiscal multiplier could be increasing with the degree of imperfect competition in the output market. The reason for this is that imperfect competition in the output market tends to reduce the real wage, leading to the household substituting away from consumption towards leisure. When government spending is increased, the corresponding increase in lump-sum taxation causes both leisure and consumption to decrease (assuming that they are both a normal good). The greater the degree of imperfect competition in the output market, the lower the real wage and hence the more the reduction falls on leisure (i.e. households work more) and less on consumption. Hence the fiscal multiplier is less than one, but increasing in the degree of imperfect competition in the output market.

====Calvo staggered contracts model====

In 1983 Guillermo Calvo wrote &quot;Staggered Prices in a Utility-Maximizing Framework&quot;. The original article was written in a continuous time mathematical framework, but nowadays is mostly used in its discrete time version. The Calvo model has become the most common way to model nominal rigidity in new Keynesian models. There is a probability that the firm can reset its price in any one period (the hazard rate), or equivalently the probability () that the price will remain unchanged in that period (the survival rate). The probability is sometimes called the &quot;Calvo probability&quot; in this context. In the Calvo model the crucial feature is that the price-setter does not know how long the nominal price will remain in place, in contrast to the Taylor model where the length of contract is known &quot;ex ante&quot;.

==== Coordination failure ====

Coordination failure was another important new Keynesian concept developed as another potential explanation for recessions and unemployment. In recessions a factory can go idle even though there are people willing to work in it, and people willing to buy its production if they had jobs. In such a scenario, economic downturns appear to be the result of coordination failure: The invisible hand fails to coordinate the usual, optimal, flow of production and consumption. Russell Cooper and Andrew John&#x27;s 1988 paper &quot;Coordinating Coordination Failures in Keynesian Models&quot; expressed a general form of coordination as models with multiple equilibria where agents could coordinate to improve (or at least not harm) each of their respective situations. Cooper and John based their work on earlier models including Peter Diamond&#x27;s 1982 coconut model, which demonstrated a case of coordination failure involving search and matching theory. In Diamond&#x27;s model producers are more likely to produce if they see others producing. The increase in possible trading partners increases the likelihood of a given producer finding someone to trade with. As in other cases of coordination failure, Diamond&#x27;s model has multiple equilibria, and the welfare of one agent is dependent on the decisions of others. Diamond&#x27;s model is an example of a &quot;thick-market externality&quot; that causes markets to function better when more people and firms participate in them. Other potential sources of coordination failure include self-fulfilling prophecies. If a firm anticipates a fall in demand, they might cut back on hiring. A lack of job vacancies might worry workers who then cut back on their consumption. This fall in demand meets the firm&#x27;s expectations, but it is entirely due to the firm&#x27;s own actions.

==== Labor market failures: Efficiency wages ====

New Keynesians offered explanations for the failure of the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. The most important of these theories was the efficiency wage theory used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.
In efficiency wage models, workers are paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might pay more than a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential.Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz&#x27;s 1984 paper &quot;Equilibrium Unemployment as a Worker Discipline Device&quot; created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having to move to a new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.

===1990s===

====New neoclassical synthesis====

In the early 1990s, economists began to combine the elements of new Keynesian economics developed in the 1980s and earlier with Real Business Cycle Theory. RBC models were dynamic but assumed perfect competition; new Keynesian models were primarily static but based on imperfect competition. The new neoclassical synthesis essentially combined the dynamic aspects of RBC with imperfect competition and nominal rigidities of new Keynesian models. Tack Yun was one of the first to do this, in a model that used the Calvo pricing model. Goodfriend and King proposed a list of four elements that are central to the new synthesis: intertemporal optimization, rational expectations, imperfect competition, and costly price adjustment (menu costs). Goodfriend and King also find that the consensus models produce certain policy implications: whilst monetary policy can affect real output in the short-run, but there is no long-run trade-off: money is not neutral in the short-run but it is in the long-run. Inflation has negative welfare effects. It is important for central banks to maintain credibility through rules based policy like inflation targeting.

====Taylor Rule====

In 1993, John B Taylor formulated the idea of a Taylor rule, which is a reduced form approximation of the responsiveness of the nominal interest rate, as set by the central bank, to changes in inflation, output, or other economic conditions. In particular, the rule describes how, for each one-percent increase in inflation, the central bank tends to raise the nominal interest rate by more than one percentage point. This aspect of the rule is often called the Taylor principle. Although such rules provide concise, descriptive proxies for central bank policy, they are not, in practice, explicitly proscriptively considered by central banks when setting nominal rates.

Taylor&#x27;s original version of the rule describes how the nominal interest rate responds to divergences of actual inflation rates from &quot;target&quot; inflation rates and of actual gross domestic product (GDP) from &quot;potential&quot; GDP:

formula_1

In this equation, formula_2 is the target short-term nominal interest rate (e.g. the federal funds rate in the US, the Bank of England base rate in the UK), formula_3 is the rate of inflation as measured by the GDP deflator, formula_4 is the desired rate of inflation, formula_5 is the assumed equilibrium real interest rate, formula_6 is the logarithm of real GDP, and formula_7 is the logarithm of potential output, as determined by a linear trend.

====New Keynesian Phillips curve====

The New Keynesian Phillips curve was originally derived by Roberts in 1995, and has since been used in most state-of-the-art New Keynesian DSGE models. The new Keynesian Phillips curve says that this period&#x27;s inflation depends on current output and the expectations of next period&#x27;s inflation. The curve is derived from the dynamic Calvo model of pricing and in mathematical terms is:

formula_8

The current period expectations of next period&#x27;s inflation are incorporated as formula_9, where formula_10 is the discount factor. The constant formula_11 captures the response of inflation to output, and is largely determined by the probability of changing price in any period, which is formula_12:
formula_13.

The less rigid nominal prices are (the higher is formula_12), the greater the effect of output on current inflation.

====Science of monetary policy====

The ideas developed in the 1990s were put together to develop the new Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium used to analyze monetary policy. This culminated in the three-equation new Keynesian model found in the survey by Richard Clarida, Jordi Gali, and Mark Gertler in the &quot;Journal of Economic Literature&quot;. It combines the two equations of the new Keynesian Phillips curve and the Taylor rule with the &quot;dynamic IS curve&quot; derived from the optimal dynamic consumption equation (household&#x27;s Euler equation).

formula_15

These three equations formed a relatively simple model which could be used for the theoretical analysis of policy issues. However, the model was oversimplified in some respects (for example, there is no capital or investment). Also, it does not perform well empirically.

===2000s===

In the new millennium there have been several advances in new Keynesian economics.

====Introduction of imperfectly competitive labor markets====
Whilst the models of the 1990s focused on sticky prices in the output market, in 2000 Christopher Erceg, Dale Henderson and Andrew Levin adopted the Blanchard and Kiyotaki model of unionized labor markets by combining it with the Calvo pricing approach and introduced it into a new Keynesian DSGE model.

====Development of complex DSGE models====
To have models that worked well with the data and could be used for policy simulations, quite complicated new Keynesian models were developed with several features. Seminal papers were published by Frank Smets and Rafael Wouters and also Lawrence J. Christiano, Martin Eichenbaum and Charles Evans The common features of these models included:

*Habit persistence. The marginal utility of consumption depends on past consumption.
*Calvo pricing in both output and product markets, with indexation so that when wages and prices are not explicitly reset, they are updated for inflation.
*Capital adjustment costs and variable capital use.
*New shocks
**Demand shocks, which affect the marginal utility of consumption
** Markup shocks that influence the desired markup of price over marginal cost.
*Monetary policy is represented by a Taylor rule.
*Bayesian estimation methods.

====Sticky information====
The idea of sticky information found in Fischer&#x27;s model was later developed by Gregory Mankiw and Ricardo Reis. This added a new feature to Fischer&#x27;s model: there is a fixed probability that a worker can replan their wages or prices each period. Using quarterly data, they assumed a value of 25%: that is, each quarter 25% of randomly chosen firms/unions can plan a trajectory of current and future prices based on current information. Thus if we consider the current period: 25% of prices will be based on the latest information available; the rest on information that was available when they last were able to replan their price trajectory. Mankiw and Reis found that the model of sticky information provided a good way of explaining inflation persistence.

Sticky information models do not have nominal rigidity: firms or unions are free to choose different prices or wages for each period. It is the information that is sticky, not the prices. Thus when a firm gets lucky and can re-plan its current and future prices, it will choose a trajectory of what it believes will be the optimal prices now and in the future. In general, this will involve setting a different price every period covered by the plan. This is at odds with the empirical evidence on prices. There are now many studies of price rigidity in different countries: the United States, the Eurozone, the United Kingdom and others. These studies all show that whilst there are some sectors where prices change frequently, there are also other sectors where prices remain fixed over time. The lack of sticky prices in the sticky information model is inconsistent with the behavior of prices in most of the economy. This has led to attempts to formulate a &quot;dual stickiness&quot; model that combines sticky information with sticky prices.

=== 2010s ===
The 2010s saw the development of models incorporating household heterogeneity into the standard New Keynesian framework, commonly referred as &#x27;HANK&#x27; models (Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian). In addition to sticky prices, a typical HANK model features uninsurable idiosyncratic labor income risk which gives rise to a non-degenerate wealth distribution. The earliest models with these two features include Oh and Reis (2012), McKay and Reis (2016) and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2017).

The name &quot;HANK model&quot; was coined by Greg Kaplan, Benjamin Moll and Gianluca Violante in a 2018 paper that additionally models households as accumulating two types of assets, one liquid and the other illiquid. This translates into rich heterogeneity in portfolio composition across households. In particular, the model fits empirical evidence by featuring a large share of households holding little liquid wealth: the &#x27;hand-to-mouth&#x27; households. Consistent with empirical evidence, about two-thirds of these households hold non-trivial amounts of illiquid wealth, despite holding little liquid wealth. These households are known as wealthy hand-to-mouth households, a term introduced in a 2014 study of fiscal stimulus policies by Kaplan and Violante.

The existence of wealthy hand-to-mouth households in New Keynesian models matters for the effects of monetary policy, because the consumption behavior of those households is strongly sensitive to changes in disposable income, rather than variations in the interest rate (i.e. the price of future consumption relative to current consumption). The direct corollary is that monetary policy is mostly transmitted via general equilibrium effects that work through the household labor income, rather than through intertemporal substitution, which is the main transmission channel in Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) models.

There are two main implications for monetary policy. First, monetary policy interacts strongly with fiscal policy, because of the failure of Ricardian Equivalence due to the presence of hand-to-mouth households. In particular, changes in the interest rate shift the Government&#x27;s budget constraint, and the fiscal response to this shift affects households&#x27; disposable income. Second, aggregate monetary shocks are not distributional neutral since they affect the return on capital, which affects households with different levels of wealth and assets differently.

==Policy implications==

New Keynesian economists agree with New Classical economists that in the long run, the classical dichotomy holds: changes in the money supply are neutral. However, because prices are sticky in the New Keynesian model, an increase in the money supply (or equivalently, a decrease in the interest rate) does increase output and lower unemployment in the short run. Furthermore, some New Keynesian models confirm the non-neutrality of money under several conditions.

Nonetheless, New Keynesian economists do not advocate using expansive monetary policy for short run gains in output and employment, as it would raise inflationary expectations and thus store up problems for the future. Instead, they advocate using monetary policy for stabilization. That is, suddenly increasing the money supply just to produce a temporary economic boom is not recommended as eliminating the increased inflationary expectations will be impossible without producing a recession.

However, when the economy is hit by some unexpected external shock, it may be a good idea to offset the macroeconomic effects of the shock with monetary policy. This is especially true if the unexpected shock is one (like a fall in consumer confidence) which tends to lower both output and inflation; in that case, expanding the money supply (lowering interest rates) helps by increasing output while stabilizing inflation and inflationary expectations.

Studies of optimal monetary policy in New Keynesian DSGE models have focused on interest rate rules (especially &#x27;Taylor rules&#x27;), specifying how the central bank should adjust the nominal interest rate in response to changes in inflation and output. (More precisely, optimal rules usually react to changes in the output gap, rather than changes in output &quot;per se&quot;.) In some simple New Keynesian DSGE models, it turns out that stabilizing inflation suffices, because maintaining perfectly stable inflation also stabilizes output and employment to the maximum degree desirable. Blanchard and Galí have called this property the &#x27;divine coincidence&#x27;.

However, they also show that in models with more than one market imperfection (for example, frictions in adjusting the employment level, as well as sticky prices), there is no longer a &#x27;divine coincidence&#x27;, and instead there is a tradeoff between stabilizing inflation and stabilizing employment. Further, while some macroeconomists believe that New Keynesian models are on the verge of being useful for quarter-to-quarter quantitative policy advice, disagreement exists.

Alves (2014) showed that the divine coincidence does not necessarily hold in the non-linear form of the standard New-Keynesian model. This property would only hold if the monetary authority is set to keep the inflation rate at exactly 0%. At any other desired target for the inflation rate, there is an endogenous trade-off, even under the absence real imperfections such as sticky wages, and the divine coincidence no longer holds.

==Relation to other macroeconomic schools==
Over the years, a sequence of &#x27;new&#x27; macroeconomic theories related to or opposed to Keynesianism have been influential. After World War II, Paul Samuelson used the term &quot;neoclassical synthesis&quot; to refer to the integration of Keynesian economics with neoclassical economics. The idea was that the government and the central bank would maintain rough full employment, so that neoclassical notions—centered on the axiom of the universality of scarcity—would apply. John Hicks&#x27; IS/LM model was central to the neoclassical synthesis.

Later work by economists such as James Tobin and Franco Modigliani involving more emphasis on the microfoundations of consumption and investment was sometimes called neo-Keynesianism. It is often contrasted with the post-Keynesianism of Paul Davidson, which emphasizes the role of fundamental uncertainty in economic life, especially concerning issues of private fixed investment.

New Keynesianism was a response to Robert Lucas and the new classical school. That school criticized the inconsistencies of Keynesianism in the light of the concept of &quot;rational expectations&quot;. The new classicals combined a unique market-clearing equilibrium (at full employment) with rational expectations. The New Keynesians used &quot;microfoundations&quot; to demonstrate that price stickiness hinders markets from clearing. Thus, the rational expectations-based equilibrium need not be unique.

Whereas the neoclassical synthesis hoped that fiscal and monetary policy would maintain full employment, the new classicals assumed that price and wage adjustment would automatically attain this situation in the short run. The new Keynesians, on the other hand, saw full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run, since prices are &quot;sticky&quot; in the short run. Government and central-bank policies are needed because the &quot;long run&quot; may be very long.

Ultimately, the differences between new classical macroeconomics and New Keynesian economics were resolved in the new neoclassical synthesis of the 1990s, which forms the basis of mainstream economics today, and the Keynesian stress on the importance of centralized coordination of macroeconomic policies (e.g., monetary and fiscal stimulus), international economic institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), and of the maintenance of a controlled trading system was highlighted during the 2008 global financial and economic crisis. This has been reflected in the work of IMF economists and of Donald Markwell.
