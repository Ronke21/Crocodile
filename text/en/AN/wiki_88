<text>Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles: A Pure Woman is the twelfth published novel by English author Thomas Hardy. It initially appeared in a censored and serialised version, published by the British illustrated newspaper &quot;The Graphic&quot; in 1891, then in book form in three volumes in 1891, and as a single volume in 1892. Although now considered a major novel of the 19th century, &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; received mixed reviews when it first appeared, in part because it challenged the sexual morals of late Victorian England.

The novel is set in an impoverished rural England, Thomas Hardy&#x27;s fictional Wessex.

==Plot==
===The Maiden===
Tess Durbeyfield, a country girl of 16, is the eldest child of John Durbeyfield, a haggler, and his wife Joan. When the local parson tells John that &quot;Durbeyfield&quot; is a corruption of &quot;D&#x27;Urberville&quot; and that he is descended from an ancient Norman family, John celebrates by getting drunk. Tess drives to market in her father&#x27;s place, but falls asleep at the reins; the wagon crashes and the family&#x27;s only horse is killed. Feeling guilty, she agrees to visit Mrs d&#x27;Urberville, a rich widow, to &quot;claim kin&quot;, unaware that the widow&#x27;s late husband Simon Stoke had adopted the surname to distance himself from his tradesman&#x27;s roots.

Alec d&#x27;Urberville, the son, is attracted to Tess and finds her a job as his mother&#x27;s poultry keeper. Tess resists Alec&#x27;s manipulative attentions. One night, on the pretence of rescuing her from a fight, Alec takes her on his horse to a remote spot, and it is implied that he rapes her.

===Maiden No More===
The following summer, Tess gives birth to a sickly boy. Unable to find a parson prepared to christen a child born out of wedlock, Tess attempts to do it herself, naming her dying child Sorrow.

===The Rally===
Some years later, Tess finds employment as a milkmaid at Talbothays Dairy, where her past is unknown. She falls in love with Angel Clare, an apprentice gentleman farmer who is studying dairy management.

===The Consequence===

Angel&#x27;s father, James Clare, a clergyman, is surprised that his son wishes to marry a milkmaid but makes no objection, understanding Tess to be a pure and devout country maiden.

Feeling she has no choice but to conceal her past, Tess is reluctant to accept Angel&#x27;s marriage proposal, but eventually agrees. She later tries several times to tell Angel of her history, but he says that they can share confidences after the wedding.

The couple spend their wedding night at an old d&#x27;Urberville mansion. When Angel confesses that he once had a brief affair with an older woman, Tess tells him about Alec, sure now he will understand and forgive.

===The Woman Pays===
Angel is appalled. Tess is not the pure maiden he took her for, and although he concedes she was &quot;more sinned against&quot; than sinning, he feels that her &quot;want of firmness&quot; amounts to a character flaw. The couple separate after a few days. Tess returns home while Angel travels to Brazil to try farming there.

Tess&#x27;s family soon exhaust the funds Angel has given her, and she is forced to take field work at the farm of Flintcomb-Ash.

===The Convert===
Alec d&#x27;Urberville continues to pursue Tess although she is already married. When Tess learns from her younger sister &#x27;Liza-Lu that her parents are ill, she rushes home. Her mother recovers but her father dies, and the destitute family is evicted from their home. Alec tells Tess that her husband will never return, and he offers to house the Durbeyfields on his estate. She refuses.

Angel&#x27;s farming venture fails, he repents of his treatment of Tess, and he decides to return to England.

===Fulfilment===
After a long search, Angel finds Tess elegantly dressed and living in a boarding house in the fashionable seaside resort of Sandbourne, under the name of &quot;Mrs d&#x27;Urberville&quot;. In anguish, Tess tells him he has arrived too late. Angel reluctantly leaves. 

Tess and Alec argue, and Tess leaves the house. Sitting in her parlour beneath the d&#x27;Urbervilles&#x27; rented rooms, the landlady notices a spreading red spot – a bloodstain – on the ceiling. Tess has stabbed Alec to death in his bed.

Tess chases after Angel and tells him of the deed. The couple find an empty house and stay there for five days in blissful, loving seclusion before being forced to move to evade capture. In the night, they stumble upon Stonehenge. Tess asks Angel to marry and look after &#x27;Liza-Lu when she is gone. She sleeps on an ancient stone altar. At dawn, while Tess sleeps, Angel sees they are surrounded. Tess&#x27;s final words on waking are &quot;I am ready.&quot;

Angel and &#x27;Liza-Lu look down at 8 a.m. from a nearby hill over the town of Wintoncester as a black flag that signals Tess&#x27;s execution is raised over the prison. Angel and &#x27;Liza-Lu go on their way hand in hand.

==Symbolism ==
=== Themes ===

Hardy&#x27;s writing often explores what he called the &quot;ache of modernism&quot;, a theme notable in &quot;Tess&quot;, which as one critic noted, Hardy draws on imagery associated with hell to describe modern farm machinery and suggests the effete nature of city life as milk sent there must be watered down before townspeople can stomach it.

On the other hand, the Marxist critic Raymond Williams in &quot;The English Novel from Dickens to Lawrence&quot; questions the identification of Tess with a peasantry destroyed by industrialization. Williams sees Tess not as a peasant, but as an educated member of the rural working class, who suffers a tragedy through being thwarted in her hopes to rise socially and desire for a good life (which includes love and sex), not by industrialism, but by the landed bourgeoisie (Alec), liberal idealism (Angel) and Christian moralism in her family&#x27;s village (see Chapter LI). Earlier commentators were not always appreciative. Henry James and Robert Louis Stevenson in Bournemouth &quot;loved to talk of books and bookmen. Stevenson, unlike James, was an admirer of Thomas Hardy, but wrote to James expressing his violent reaction to &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles;&quot; James wrote back agreeing the book was &#x27;vile&#x27; (not a word used by Stevenson).

=== References, personification, character, experiences ===
Because of the numerous pagan and neo-Biblical references made about her, Tess has been seen variously as an Earth goddess or a sacrificial victim.

Tess has been seen as a personification of nature, an idea supported by her ties with animals throughout the novel. Tess&#x27;s misfortunes begin when she falls asleep while driving Prince to market and causes the horse&#x27;s death; at Trantridge she becomes a poultry-keeper; she and Angel fall in love amid cows in the fertile Froom valley; on the road to Flintcomb-Ash, she kills some wounded pheasants to end their suffering.

However, Tess emerges as a powerful character not through this symbolism but because &quot;Hardy&#x27;s feelings for her were strong, perhaps stronger than for any of his other invented personages.&quot;

When Hardy was 16, he saw the hanging of Elizabeth Martha Brown, who had murdered a violent husband. This fascinating, yet repellent experience contributed to the writing of &quot;Tess&quot;.

=== Morality and society ===
The moral commentary running through the novel insists that &quot;Tess&quot; is not at fault in imposing mythological, biblical and folk imagery on a story of a young girl seduced and abandoned to create a &quot;challenging contemporaneity&quot;. It was controversial and polarizing, setting these elements in a context of 19th-century English society, including disputes in the Church, the National School movement, the overall class structure of English society, and changing circumstances of rural labour. During the era of first-wave feminism, civil divorce was introduced and campaigns were waged against child prostitution, moving gender and sexuality issues to the forefront of public discussion. Hardy&#x27;s work was criticized as vulgar, but by the late 19th century other experimental fiction works were released such as Florence Dixie&#x27;s depiction of feminist utopia, &quot;The Story of an African Farm&quot; by Olive Schreiner, and Sarah Grand&#x27;s work &quot;The Heavenly Twins&quot;. These raised awareness of syphilis and advocating sensitivity rather than condemnation for young women infected with it.

=== Rape/seduction ===
Hardy&#x27;s description leaves it unclear whether Alec d’Urberville rapes Tess or whether he seduces her, and the issue has been the subject of debate.

Mary Jacobus, a commentator on Hardy&#x27;s works, speculates that the rape/seduction ambiguity may have been forced on the author to meet publisher requirements and the &quot;Grundyist&quot; readership of his time.

==Adaptations==
===Theatre===

The novel was adapted for the stage in 1897. The production by Lorimer Stoddard proved a Broadway triumph for actress Minnie Maddern Fiske when it opened on 2 March 1897. A copyright performance was given at St James&#x27;s Theatre in London on the same date. It was revived in America in 1902 and then made into a motion picture by Adolph Zukor in 1913, starring Mrs. Fiske; no copies remain.

In the UK, an adaptation, &quot;Tess&quot;, by H. Mountford, opened at the Grand Theatre in Blackpool on 5 January 1900. 

&quot;Tess&quot;, a different stage adaptation by H. A. Kennedy, premièred at the Coronet Theatre in London&#x27;s Notting Hill Gate on 19 February 1900. Mrs Lewis Waller (Florence West) played the title role, with William Kettridge as Angel Clare and Whitworth Jones as Alec Tantridge. The play transferred to the Comedy Theatre for 17 performances from 14 April 1900 with a slightly different cast, including Fred Terry as Alec and Oswald Yorke as Angel.

In 1924, Hardy wrote a British theatrical adaptation and chose Gertrude Bugler, a Dorchester girl from the original Hardy Players to play Tess. The Hardy Players (re-formed in 2005) was an amateur group from Dorchester that re-enacted Hardy&#x27;s novels. Bugler was acclaimed, but prevented from taking the London stage part by the jealousy of Hardy&#x27;s wife Florence; Hardy had said that young Gertrude was the true incarnation of the Tess he had imagined. Years before writing the novel, Hardy had been inspired by the beauty of her mother Augusta Way, then an 18-year-old milkmaid, when he visited Augusta&#x27;s father&#x27;s farm in Bockhampton. When Hardy saw Bugler (he rehearsed The Hardy Players at the hotel run by her parents), he immediately recognised her as a young image of the now older Augusta.

The novel was successfully adapted for the stage several more times:
*1946: An adaptation by playwright Ronald Gow became a triumph on the West End starring Wendy Hiller.
*1999: &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;, a new West End musical with music by Stephen Edwards and lyrics by Justin Fleming opens in London at the Savoy Theatre.
*2007: &quot;Tess, The New Musical&quot; (a rock opera) with lyrics, music and libretto by Annie Pasqua and Jenna Pasqua premières in New York City.
*2009: &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;, a new stage adaptation with five actors was produced in London by Myriad Theatre &amp; Film.
*2010: &quot;Tess&quot;, a new rock opera, is an official Next Link Selection at the New York Musical Theatre Festival with music, lyrics, and libretto by Annie Pasqua and Jenna Pasqua.
*2011: &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;, adapted from the original 1924 script by Devina Symes for Norrie Woodhall, the last surviving member of Hardy’s theatrical group, the Hardy Players. Three extra scenes were included at Woodhall&#x27;s request, including the final one, staged as Woodhall described it from her own appearance in Hardy&#x27;s original adaptation: &quot;Tess, accompanied by Angel Clare, is arrested by a phalanx of constables for the murder of her other suitor Alec d&#x27;Urberville at sunrise, after a night spent within the bluestone towers of a lonely henge on the bleak and wind swept expanse of Salisbury Plain.&quot;
*2012: &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; was produced into a piece of musical theatre by Youth Music Theatre UK as part of their summer season, and further developed, edited and performed in 2017 at the Theatre Royal, Winchester, and The Other Palace, London in 2018.
*2019: &quot;Tess - The Musical&quot;, a new British musical by composer Michael Blore and playwright Michael Davies, received a workshop production at The Other Place, the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s studio theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, in February 2019.

===Opera===
1906: An Italian operatic version written by Frederic d&#x27;Erlanger was first performed in Naples, but the run was cut short by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius. When the opera came to London three years later, Hardy, then 69, attended the premiere.

<text>Matriarchy is a social system in which positions of dominance without violence and privilege are held by women. In a broader sense it can also extend to moral authority, social privilege, and control of property. While those definitions apply in general English, definitions specific to anthropology and feminism differ in some respects, no statement has been found that clearly states that any other country or region is a matriarchal society except the Republic of China.

Matriarchies may also be confused with matrilineal, matrilocal, and matrifocal societies. While some may consider any non-patriarchal system to be matriarchal, most academics exclude those systems from matriarchies as strictly defined. Many societies have had matriarchal elements, but unlike the patriarchal.

== Definitions, connotations, and etymology ==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;), matriarchy is a &quot;form of social organization in which the mother or oldest female is the head of the family, and descent and relationship are reckoned through the female line; government or rule by a woman or women.&quot; A popular definition, according to James Peoples and Garrick Bailey, is &quot;female dominance&quot;. Within the academic discipline of cultural anthropology, according to the &quot;OED&quot;, matriarchy is a &quot;culture or community in which such a system prevails&quot; or a &quot;family, society, organization, etc., dominated by a woman or women&quot; without reference to laws that require women to dominate. In general anthropology, according to William A. Haviland, matriarchy is &quot;rule by women&quot;. According to Lawrence A. Kuzner in 1997, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown argued in 1924 that the definitions of matriarchy and patriarchy had &quot;logical and empirical failings (...) [and] were too vague to be scientifically useful&quot;.

Most academics exclude egalitarian nonpatriarchal systems from matriarchies more strictly defined. According to Heide Göttner-Abendroth, a reluctance to accept the existence of matriarchies might be based on a specific culturally biased notion of how to define matriarchy: because in a patriarchy men rule over women, a matriarchy has frequently been conceptualized as women ruling over men, while she believed that matriarchies are egalitarian.
The word matriarchy, for a society politically led by females, especially mothers, who also control property, is often interpreted to mean the general opposite of patriarchy, but it is not an opposite. According to Peoples and Bailey, the view of anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday is that matriarchies are not a mirror or inverted form of patriarchies but rather that a matriarchy &quot;emphasizes maternal meanings where &#x27;maternal symbols are linked to social practices influencing the lives of both sexes and where women play a central role in these practices. Journalist Margot Adler wrote, &quot;literally, ... [&quot;matriarchy&quot;] means government by mothers, or more broadly, government and power in the hands of women.&quot; Barbara Love and Elizabeth Shanklin wrote, &quot;by &#x27;matriarchy,&#x27; we mean a non-alienated society: a society in which women, those who produce the next generation, define motherhood, determine the conditions of motherhood, and determine the environment in which the next generation is reared.&quot; According to Cynthia Eller, &quot;&#x27;matriarchy&#x27; can be thought of ... as a shorthand description for any society in which women&#x27;s power is equal or superior to men&#x27;s and in which the culture centers around values and life events described as &#x27;feminine.&#x27;&quot; Eller wrote that the idea of matriarchy mainly rests on two pillars, romanticism and modern social criticism. With respect to a prehistoric matriarchal Golden Age, according to Barbara Epstein, &quot;matriarchy ... means a social system organized around matriliny and goddess worship in which women have positions of power.&quot; According to Adler, in the Marxist tradition, it usually refers to a pre-class society &quot;where women and men share equally in production and power.&quot;

According to Adler, &quot;a number of feminists note that few definitions of the word [matriarchy], despite its literal meaning, include any concept of power, and they suggest that centuries of oppression have made it impossible for women to conceive of themselves with such power.&quot;

Matriarchy has often been presented as negative, in contrast to patriarchy as natural and inevitable for society, and thus that matriarchy is hopeless. Love and Shanklin wrote:
When we hear the word &quot;matriarchy&quot;, we are conditioned to a number of responses: that matriarchy refers to the past and that matriarchies have never existed; that matriarchy is a hopeless fantasy of female domination, of mothers dominating children, of women being cruel to men. Conditioning us negatively to matriarchy is, of course, in the interests of patriarchs. We are made to feel that patriarchy is natural; we are less likely to question it, and less likely to direct our energies to ending it.

The Matriarchal Studies school led by Göttner-Abendroth calls for an even more inclusive redefinition of the term: Göttner-Abendroth defines &quot;Modern Matriarchal Studies&quot; as the &quot;investigation and presentation of non-patriarchal societies&quot;, effectively defining matriarchy as non-patriarchy. She has also defined matriarchy as characterized by the sharing of power equally between the two genders. According to Diane LeBow, &quot;matriarchal societies are often described as ... egalitarian ...&quot;, although anthropologist Ruby Rohrlich has written of &quot;the centrality of women in an egalitarian society.&quot;

Matriarchy is also the public formation in which the woman occupies the ruling position in a family. Some, including Daniel Moynihan, claimed that there is a matriarchy among Black families in the United States, because a quarter of them were headed by single women; thus, families composing a substantial minority of a substantial minority could be enough for the latter to constitute a matriarchy within a larger non-matriarchal society with non-matriarchal political dynamics.

Etymologically, it is from Latin &quot;māter&quot; (genitive &quot;mātris&quot;), &quot;mother&quot; and Greek ἄρχειν &quot;arkhein&quot;, &quot;to rule&quot;. The notion of matriarchy was defined by Joseph-François Lafitau (1681–1746), who first named it &quot;ginécocratie&quot;. According to the &quot;OED&quot;, the earliest known attestation of the word matriarchy is in 1885. By contrast, gynæcocracy, meaning &#x27;rule of women&#x27;, has been in use since the 17th century, building on the Greek word found in Aristotle and Plutarch.

Terms with similar etymology are also used in various social sciences and humanities to describe matriarchal or &quot;matriological&quot; aspects of social, cultural, and political processes. Adjective &quot;matriological&quot; is derived from the noun &quot;matriology&quot; that comes from Latin word &quot;māter&quot; (mother) and Greek word λογος (&quot;logos&quot;, teaching about). The term matriology was used in theology and history of religion as a designation for the study of particular motherly aspects of various female deities. The term was subsequently borrowed by other social sciences and humanities and its meaning was widened in order to describe and define particular female-dominated and female-centered aspects of cultural and social life. The male alternative for matriology is patriology, with patriarchy being the male alternative to matriarchy.

In their works, Johann Jakob Bachofen and Lewis Morgan used such terms and expressions as &quot;mother-right&quot;, &quot;female rule&quot;, &quot;gyneocracy&quot;, and &quot;female authority&quot;. All these terms meant the same: the rule by females (mother or wife). Although Bachofen and Lewis Morgan confined the &quot;mother-right&quot; inside households, it was the basis of female influence upon the whole society. The authors of the classics did not think that &quot;gyneocracy&quot; meant &#x27;female government&#x27; in politics. They were aware of the fact that the sexual structure of government had no relation to domestic rule and to roles of both sexes.

A matriarchy is also sometimes called a &quot;gynarchy&quot;, a &quot;gynocracy&quot;, a &quot;gynecocracy&quot;, or a &quot;gynocentric&quot; society, although these terms do not definitionally emphasize motherhood. Cultural anthropologist Jules de Leeuwe argued that some societies were &quot;mainly &quot;gynecocratic&quot;&quot; (others being &quot;mainly &quot;androcratic&quot;&quot;).

Gynecocracy, gynaecocracy, gynocracy, gyneocracy, and gynarchy generally mean &#x27;government by women over women and men&#x27;. All of these words are synonyms in their most important definitions, and while these words all share that principal meaning, they differ a little in their additional meanings, so that &quot;gynecocracy&quot; also means &#x27;women&#x27;s social supremacy&#x27;, &quot;gynaecocracy&quot; also means &#x27;government by one woman&#x27;, &#x27;female dominance&#x27;, and, derogatorily, &#x27;petticoat government&#x27;, and &quot;gynocracy&quot; also means &#x27;women as the ruling class&#x27;. &quot;Gyneocracy&quot; is rarely used in modern times. None of these definitions are limited to mothers.

Some question whether a queen ruling without a king is sufficient to constitute female government, given the amount of participation of other men in most such governments. One view is that it is sufficient. &quot;By the end of [Queen] Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, gynecocracy was a &quot;fait accompli&quot;&quot;, according to historian Paula Louise Scalingi. Gynecocracy is defined by Scalingi as &quot;government by women&quot;, similar to dictionary definitions (one dictionary adding &#x27;women&#x27;s social supremacy&#x27; to the governing role). Scalingi reported arguments for and against the validity of gynocracy and said, &quot;the humanists treated the question of female rule as part of the larger controversy over sexual equality.&quot; Possibly, queenship, because of the power wielded by men in leadership and assisting a queen, leads to queen bee syndrome, contributing to the difficulty of other women in becoming heads of the government.

Some matriarchies have been described by historian Helen Diner as &quot;a strong gynocracy&quot; and &quot;women monopolizing government&quot; and she described matriarchal Amazons as &quot;an extreme, feminist wing&quot; of humanity and that North African women &quot;ruled the country politically&quot; before being overthrown by forms of patriarchy and, according to Adler, Diner &quot;envision[ed] a dominance matriarchy&quot;.

Gynocentrism is the &#x27;dominant or exclusive focus on women&#x27;, is opposed to androcentrism, and &quot;invert[s] ... the privilege of the ... [male/female] binary ...[,] [some feminists] arguing for &#x27;the superiority of values embodied in traditionally female experience&#x27;&quot;.

=== Intergenerational relationships ===
Some people who sought evidence for the existence of a matriarchy often mixed matriarchy with anthropological terms and concepts describing specific arrangements in the field of family relationships and the organization of family life, such as matrilineality and matrilocality. These terms refer to intergenerational relationships (as matriarchy may), but do not distinguish between males and females insofar as they apply to specific arrangements for sons as well as daughters from the perspective of their relatives on their mother&#x27;s side. Accordingly, these concepts do not represent matriarchy as &#x27;power of women over men&#x27; but instead familial dynamics.

=== Words beginning with &quot;matri-&quot; ===

Anthropologists have begun to use the term matrifocality. There is some debate concerning the terminological delineation between &quot;matrifocality&quot; and &quot;matriarchy&quot;. Matrifocal societies are those in which women, especially mothers, occupy a central position. Anthropologist R. T. Smith refers to &quot;matrifocality&quot; as the kinship structure of a social system whereby the mothers assume structural prominence. The term does not necessarily imply domination by women or mothers. In addition, some authors depart from the premise of a mother-child dyad as the core of a human group where the grandmother was the central ancestor with her children and grandchildren clustered around her in an extended family.

The term matricentric means &#x27;having a mother as head of the family or household&#x27;.
Matristic: Feminist scholars and archeologists such as Marija Gimbutas, Gerda Lerner, and Riane Eisler label their notion of a &quot;woman-centered&quot; society surrounding Mother Goddess worship during prehistory (in Paleolithic and Neolithic Europe) and in ancient civilizations by using the term &quot;matristic&quot; rather than &quot;matriarchal.&quot; Marija Gimbutas states that she uses &quot;the term matristic simply to avoid the term matriarchy with the understanding that it incorporates matriliny.&quot;

Matrilineality, in which descent is traced through the female line, is sometimes conflated with historical matriarchy. Sanday favors redefining and reintroducing the word &quot;matriarchy&quot;, especially in reference to contemporary matrilineal societies such as the Minangkabau. The 19th-century belief that matriarchal societies existed was due to the transmission of &quot;economic and social power ... through kinship lines&quot; so that &quot;in a matrilineal society all power would be channeled through women. Women may not have retained all power and authority in such societies ..., but they would have been in a position to control and dispense power... not unlike the nagging wife or the domineering mother.&quot;

A matrilocal society defines a society in which a couple resides close to the bride&#x27;s family rather than the bridegroom&#x27;s family.

== History and distribution ==
Most anthropologists hold that there are no known societies that are unambiguously matriarchal, at least no matriarchal society that have completely excluded the opposite gender from roles of authority. According to J. M. Adovasio, Olga Soffer, and Jake Page, no matriarchy with the element of exclusion is known to have existed. Anthropologist Donald Brown&#x27;s list of human cultural universals (&quot;viz.&quot;, features shared by nearly all current human societies) includes men being the &quot;dominant element&quot; in public political affairs, which he asserts is the contemporary opinion of mainstream anthropology, although there are some disagreements and exceptions. 

A belief that women&#x27;s rule preceded men&#x27;s rule was, according to Haviland, &quot;held by many nineteenth-century intellectuals&quot;. The hypothesis was notably advanced in the context of feminism and especially second-wave feminism, and have gained popularity as indigenous and gender research advances.

Matriarchs, according to Peoples and Bailey, do exist; there are &quot;individual matriarchs of families and kin groups.&quot;

==== Ancient Near East ====
&quot;The Cambridge Ancient History&quot; (1975) stated that &quot;the predominance of a supreme goddess is probably a reflection from the practice of matriarchy which at all times characterized Elamite civilization to a greater or lesser degree, before this practice was overthrown by the patriarchy&quot;.

==== Europe ====
Tacitus claimed in his book &quot;Germania&quot; that in &quot;the nations of the Sitones woman is the ruling sex.&quot;

Anne Helene Gjelstad describes the women on the Estonian islands Kihnu and Manija as &quot;the last matriarchal society in Europe&quot; because &quot;the older women here take care of almost everything on land as their husbands travel the seas&quot;.
==== Asia ====
Bangladesh

The Khasi and the Garo people residing in the Sylhet and Mymensingh regions are two of the top matriarchal societies of Bangladesh.

===== Burma =====
Possible matriarchies in Burma are, according to Jorgen Bisch, the Padaungs and, according to Andrew Marshall, the Kayaw.

===== China =====
The Mosuo culture, which is in China near Tibet, is frequently described as matriarchal. The term matrilineal is sometimes used, and, while more accurate, still does not reflect the full complexity of their social organization. In fact, it is not easy to categorize Mosuo culture within traditional Western definitions. They have aspects of a matriarchal culture: women are often the head of the house, inheritance is through the female line, and women make business decisions. However, unlike in a true matriarchy, political power tends to be in the hands of males, and the current culture of the Mosuo has been heavily shaped by their minority status.

===== India =====
In India, of communities recognized in the national Constitution as Scheduled Tribes, &quot;some ... [are] matriarchal and matrilineal&quot; &quot;and thus have been known to be more egalitarian&quot;. According to interviewer Anuj Kumar, Manipur, India, &quot;has a matriarchal society&quot;, but this may not be scholarly. In Kerala, Nairs, Thiyyas, Brahmins of Payyannoor village and Muslims of North Malabar and in Karnataka, Bunts and Billavas follow the matrilineal system.

===== Indonesia =====
Anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday has said that the Minangkabau society may be a matriarchy.

===== Ancient Vietnam (before 43 CE) =====
According to William S. Turley, &quot;the role of women in traditional Vietnamese culture was determined [partly] by ... indigenous customs bearing traces of matriarchy&quot;, affecting &quot;different social classes&quot; to &quot;varying degrees&quot;. Peter C. Phan explains that &quot;the ancient Vietnamese family system was most likely matriarchal, with women ruling over the clan or tribe&quot; until the Vietnamese &quot;adopt[ed] ... the patriarchal system introduced by the Chinese.&quot; That being said, even after adopting the patriarchal Chinese system, Vietnamese women, especially peasant women, still held a higher position than women in most patriarchal societies. According to Chiricosta, the legend of Âu Cơ is said to be evidence of &quot;the presence of an original &#x27;matriarchy&#x27; in North Vietnam and [it] led to the double kinship system, which developed there ... [and which] combined matrilineal and patrilineal patterns of family structure and assigned equal importance to both lines.&quot; Chiricosta said that other scholars relied on &quot;this &#x27;matriarchal&#x27; aspect of the myth to differentiate Vietnamese society from the pervasive spread of Chinese Confucian patriarchy,&quot; and that &quot;resistance to China&#x27;s colonization of Vietnam ... [combined with] the view that Vietnam was originally a matriarchy ... [led to viewing] women&#x27;s struggles for liberation from (Chinese) patriarchy as a metaphor for the entire nation&#x27;s struggle for Vietnamese independence,&quot; and therefore, a &quot;metaphor for the struggle of the matriarchy to resist being overthrown by the patriarchy.&quot; According to Keith Weller Taylor, &quot;the matriarchal flavor of the time is ... attested by the fact that Trung Trac&#x27;s mother&#x27;s tomb and spirit temple have survived, although nothing remains of her father&quot;, and the &quot;society of the Trung sisters&quot; was &quot;strongly matrilineal&quot;. According to Donald M. Seekins, an indication of &quot;the strength of matriarchal values&quot; was that a woman, Trưng Trắc, with her younger sister Trưng Nhị, raised an army of &quot;over 80,000 soldiers ... [in which] many of her officers were women&quot;, with which they defeated the Chinese. According to Seekins, &quot;in [the year] 40, Trung Trac was proclaimed queen, and a capital was built for her&quot; and modern Vietnam considers the Trung sisters to be heroines. According to Karen G. Turner, in the third century A.D., Lady Triệu to personify the matriarchal culture that mitigated Confucianized patriarchal norms ... [although] she is also painted as something of a freak ... with her ... savage, violent streak.&quot;

==== Native Americans ====
The Hopi (in what is now the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona), according to Alice Schlegel, had as its &quot;gender ideology ... one of female superiority, and it operated within a social actuality of sexual equality.&quot; According to LeBow (based on Schlegel&#x27;s work), in the Hopi, &quot;gender roles ... are egalitarian ... [and] [n]either sex is inferior.&quot; LeBow concluded that Hopi women &quot;participate fully in ... political decision-making.&quot; According to Schlegel, &quot;the Hopi no longer live as they are described here&quot; and &quot;the attitude of female superiority is fading&quot;. Schlegel said the Hopi &quot;were and still are matrilineal&quot; and &quot;the household ... was matrilocal&quot;. Schlegel explains why there was female superiority as that the Hopi believed in &quot;life as the highest good ... [with] the female principle ... activated in women and in Mother Earth ... as its source&quot; and that the Hopi had no need for an army as they did not have rivalries with neighbors. Women were central to institutions of clan and household and predominated &quot;within the economic and social systems (in contrast to male predominance within the political and ceremonial systems).&quot; The Clan Mother, for example, was empowered to overturn land distribution by men if she felt it was unfair since there was no &quot;countervailing ... strongly centralized, male-centered political structure&quot;.

The Iroquois Confederacy or League, combining five to six Native American Haudenosaunee nations or tribes before the U.S. became a nation, operated by The Great Binding Law of Peace, a constitution by which women participated in the League&#x27;s political decision-making, including deciding whether to proceed to war, through what may have been a matriarchy or gyneocracy. According to Doug George-Kanentiio, in this society, mothers exercise central moral and political roles. The dates of this constitution&#x27;s operation are unknown; the League was formed in approximately 1000–1450, but the constitution was oral until written in about 1880. The League still exists.

George-Kanentiio explains:

In our society, women are the center of all things. Nature, we believe, has given women the ability to create; therefore it is only natural that women be in positions of power to protect this function...We traced our clans through women; a child born into the world assumed the clan membership of its mother. Our young women were expected to be physically strong...The young women received formal instruction in traditional planting...Since the Iroquois were absolutely dependent upon the crops they grew, whoever controlled this vital activity wielded great power within our communities. It was our belief that since women were the givers of life they naturally regulated the feeding of our people...In all countries, real wealth stems from the control of land and its resources. Our Iroquois philosophers knew this as well as we knew natural law. To us it made sense for women to control the land since they were far more sensitive to the rhythms of the Mother Earth. We did not own the land but were custodians of it. Our women decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used...In our political system, we mandated full equality. Our leaders were selected by a caucus of women before the appointments were subject to popular review...Our traditional governments are composed of an equal number of men and women. The men are chiefs and the women clan-mothers...As leaders, the women closely monitor the actions of the men and retain the right to veto any law they deem inappropriate...Our women not only hold the reins of political and economic power, they also have the right to determine all issues involving the taking of human life. Declarations of war had to be approved by the women, while treaties of peace were subject to their deliberations.

=== By chronology ===

==== Earliest prehistory and undated ====
The controversy surrounding prehistoric or &quot;primal&quot; matriarchy began in reaction to the 1861 book by Bachofen, &quot;Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World&quot;. Several generations of ethnologists were inspired by his pseudo-evolutionary theory of archaic matriarchy. Following him and Jane Ellen Harrison, several generations of scholars, usually arguing from known myths or oral traditions and examination of Neolithic female cult-figures, suggested that many ancient societies might have been matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware. After Bachofen&#x27;s three-volume &quot;Myth, Religion, and Mother Right&quot;, classicists such as Harrison, Arthur Evans, Walter Burkert, and James Mellaart looked at the evidence of matriarchal religion in pre-Hellenic societies. The concept was further investigated by Lewis Morgan. According to Uwe Wesel, Bachofen&#x27;s myth interpretations have proved to be untenable. According to historian Susan Mann, as of 2000, &quot;few scholars these days find ... [a &quot;notion of a stage of primal matriarchy&quot;] persuasive.&quot;

Kurt Derungs is a recent non-academic author advocating an &quot;anthropology of landscape&quot; based on allegedly matriarchal traces in toponymy and folklore.

==== Paleolithic and Neolithic Ages ====
Friedrich Engels, in 1884, claimed that, in the earliest stages of human social development, there was group marriage and that therefore paternity was disputable, whereas maternity was not, so that a family could be traced only through the female line. This was a materialist interpretation of Bachofen&#x27;s &quot;Mutterrecht&quot;. Engels speculated that the domestication of animals increased material wealth, which was claimed by men. Engels said that men wanted to control women to use as laborers and to pass on wealth to their children, requiring monogamy; as patriarchy rose, women&#x27;s status declined until they became mere objects in the exchange trade between men, causing the global defeat of the female sex and the rise of individualism and competition. According to Eller, Engels may have been influenced with respect to women&#x27;s status by August Bebel, according to whom matriarchy naturally resulted in communism, while patriarchy was characterized by exploitation.

Austrian writer Bertha Diener (or Helen Diner), wrote &quot;Mothers and Amazons&quot; (1930), the first work to focus on women&#x27;s cultural history, a classic of feminist matriarchal study. Her view is that all past human societies were originally matriarchal, while most later shifted to patriarchy and degenerated. The controversy intensified with &quot;The White Goddess&quot; by Robert Graves (1948) and his later analysis of classical Greek mythology, focusing on the reconstruction of earlier myths that had conjecturally been rewritten after a transition from matriarchal to patriarchal religion in very early historical times.

From the 1950s, Marija Gimbutas developed a theory of an &quot;Old European culture&quot; in Neolithic Europe with matriarchal traits, which had been replaced by the patriarchal system of the Proto-Indo-Europeans in the Bronze Age. However, other anthropologists warned that &quot;the goddess worship or matrilocality that evidently existed in many paleolithic societies was not necessarily associated with matriarchy in the sense of women&#x27;s power over men. Many societies can be found that exhibit those qualities along with female subordination.&quot; According to Eller, Gimbutas had a large part in constructing a myth of historical matriarchy by examining Eastern European cultures that never really resembled the alleged universal matriarchy. She asserts that in &quot;actually documented primitive societies&quot; of recent (historical) times, paternity is never ignored and that the sacred status of goddesses does not automatically increase female social status, and she interprets utopian matriarchy as an invented inversion of antifeminism.

From the 1970s, ideas of matriarchy were taken up by popular writers of second-wave feminism such as Riane Eisler, Elizabeth Gould Davis, and Merlin Stone, and expanded with the speculations of Margaret Murray on witchcraft, by the Goddess movement, and in feminist Wicca. &quot;A Golden Age of matriarchy&quot; was prominently presented by Charlene Spretnak and &quot;encouraged&quot; by Stone and Eisler, but, at least for the Neolithic Age, it has been denounced as feminist wishful thinking in works such as &quot;The Inevitability of Patriarchy&quot;, &quot;Why Men Rule&quot;, &quot;Goddess Unmasked&quot;, and &quot;The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory&quot;. The idea is not emphasized in third-wave feminism.

J.F. del Giorgio insists on a matrifocal, matrilocal, matrilineal Paleolithic society.

==== Bronze Age ====

According to Rohrlich, &quot;many scholars are convinced that Crete was a matriarchy, ruled by a queen-priestess&quot; and the &quot;Cretan civilization&quot; was &quot;matriarchal&quot; before &quot;1500 BC,&quot; when it was overrun and colonized by the patriarchy.

Also according to Rohrlich, &quot;in the early Sumerian city-states &#x27;matriarchy seems to have left something more than a trace.

One common misconception among historians of the Bronze Age such as Stone and Eisler is the notion that the Semites were matriarchal while the Indo-Europeans practiced a patriarchal system. An example of this view is found in Stone&#x27;s &quot;When God Was a Woman&quot;, wherein she makes the case that the worship of Yahweh was an Indo-European invention superimposed on an ancient matriarchal Semitic nation. Evidence from the Amorites and pre-Islamic Arabs, however, indicates that the primitive Semitic family was in fact patriarchal and patrilineal.

However, not all scholars agree. Anthropologist and Biblical scholar Raphael Patai writes in &quot;The Hebrew Goddess&quot; that the Jewish religion, far from being pure monotheism, contained from earliest times strong polytheistic elements, chief of which was the cult of Asherah, the mother goddess. A story in the Biblical Book of Judges places the worship of Asherah in the 12th century BC. Originally a Canaanite goddess, her worship was adopted by Hebrews who intermarried with Canaanites. She was worshipped in public and was represented by carved wooden poles. Numerous small nude female figurines of clay were found all over ancient Palestine and a seventh-century Hebrew text invokes her aid for a woman giving birth.

Shekinah is the name of the feminine holy spirit who embodies both divine radiance and compassion. Exemplifying various traits associated with mothers, she comforts the sick and dejected, accompanies the Jews whenever they are exiled, and intercedes with God to exercise mercy rather than to inflict retribution on sinners. While not a creation of the Hebrew Bible, Shekinah appears in a slightly later Aramaic translation of the Bible in the first or second century C.E., according to Patai. Initially portrayed as the presence of God, she later becomes distinct from God, taking on more physical attributes.

Meanwhile, the Indo-Europeans were known to have practiced multiple succession systems, and there is much better evidence of matrilineal customs among the Indo-European Celts and Germanics than among any ancient Semitic peoples.

Women ruled Sparta while the men were often away fighting, or when both kings were incapacitated or too young to rule. Gorgo, Queen of Sparta, was asked by a woman in Attica &quot;You Spartan women are the only women that lord it over your men&quot;, to which Gorgo replied: &quot;Yes, for we are the only women that are mothers of men!&quot;

==== Iron Age to Middle Ages ====
Arising in the period ranging from the Iron Age to the Middle Ages, several northwestern European mythologies from the Irish (e.g. Macha and Scáthach), the Brittonic (e.g. Rhiannon), and the Germanic (e.g. Grendel&#x27;s mother and Nerthus) contain ambiguous episodes of primal female power which have been interpreted as folk evidence of matriarchal attitudes in pre-Christian European Iron Age societies. Often transcribed from a retrospective, patriarchal, Romanised, and Catholic perspective, they hint at a possible earlier era when female power predominated. The first-century historical British figure of Boudicca indicates that Brittonnic society permitted explicit female autocracy or a form of gender equality which contrasted strongly with the patriarchal Mediterranean civilisation that later overthrew it.

==== 20th–21st centuries ====
The Mosuo people are an ethnic group in southwest China. They are considered one of the most well-known matriarchal societies, although many scholars assert that they are rather matrilineal. , the sole heirs in the family are still daughters. Since 1990, when foreign tourism became permitted, tourists started visiting the Mosuo people. As pointed out by the Xinhua News Agency, &quot;tourism has become so profitable that many Mosuo families in the area who have opened their homes have become wealthy.&quot; Although this revived their economy and lifted many out of poverty, it also altered the fabric of their society to have outsiders present who often look down on the Mosuo&#x27;s cultural practices.  

In 1995, in Kenya, according to Emily Wax, Umoja, a village only for women from one tribe with about 36 residents, was established under a matriarch. It was founded on an empty piece of land by women who fled their homes after being raped by British soldiers. They formed a safe-haven in rural Samburu County in northern Kenya. Men of the same tribe established a village nearby from which to observe the women&#x27;s village, the men&#x27;s leader objecting to the matriarch&#x27;s questioning the culture and men suing to close the women&#x27;s village. As of 2019, 48 women, most of whom who have fled gender-based violence like female genital mutilation, assault, rape, and abusive marriages call Umoja home, living with their children in this all female-village. Many of these women faced stigma in their communities following these attacks and had no choice but to flee. Others sought to escape from the nearby Samburu community, which practices child marriage and female genital mutilation.  In the village, the women practice &quot;collective economic cooperation.&quot; The sons are obligated to move out when they turn eighteen. Not only has the Umoja village protected its members, the members have also done extensive work for gender equity in Kenya. The message of the village has spread outside of Kenya as member &quot;Lolosoli&#x27;s passion for gender equity in Kenya has carried her to speak on social justice at the United Nations and to participate in an international women&#x27;s rights conference in South Africa.&quot;

The Khasi people live in Northeast India in the state of Meghalaya. Although largely considered matrilineal, some women&#x27;s studies scholars such as Roopleena Banerjee consider the Khasi to be matriarchal. Banerjee asserts that &quot;to assess and account a matriarchal society through the parameters of the patriarchy would be wrong&quot; and that &quot;we should avoid looking at history only through the colonizer/colonized boundaries.&quot; The Khasi people consist of many clans who trace their lineage through the matriarchs of the families. A Khasi husband typically moves into his wife&#x27;s home, and both wife and husband participate equally in raising their children. A Khasi woman named Passah explains that &quot;[The father] would come to his wife&#x27;s home late at night... In the morning, he&#x27;s back at his mother&#x27;s home to work in the fields,&quot; showing how a man&#x27;s role consists of supporting his wife and family in Khasi society. Traditionally, the youngest daughter, called the Khadduh, receives and cares for ancestral property. As of 2021, the Khasi continue to practice many female-led customs, with wealth and property being passed down through the female side of the family.

Spokespersons for various indigenous peoples at the United Nations and elsewhere have highlighted the central role of women in their societies, referring to them as matriarchies, in danger of being overthrown by the patriarchy, or as matriarchal in character.

== Mythology ==
=== Amazons ===
A legendary matriarchy related by several writers was Amazon society. According to Phyllis Chesler, &quot;in Amazon societies, women were ... mothers and their society&#x27;s only political and religious leaders&quot;, as well as the only warriors and hunters; &quot;queens were elected&quot; and apparently &quot;any woman could aspire to and achieve full human expression.&quot; Herodotus reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their females observed their ancient maternal customs, &quot;frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men&quot;. Moreover, said Herodotus, &quot;no girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle&quot;. Amazons came to play a role in Roman historiography. Julius Caesar spoke of the conquest of large parts of Asia by Semiramis and the Amazons. Although Strabo was sceptical about their historicity, the Amazons were taken as historical throughout late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers spoke of the Amazons as a real people. Medieval authors continued a tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, Adam of Bremen placing them at the Baltic Sea and Paulus Diaconus in the heart of Germania.

=== Greece ===
Robert Graves suggested that a myth displaced earlier myths that had to change when a major cultural change brought patriarchy to replace a matriarchy. According to this myth, in Greek mythology, Zeus is said to have swallowed his pregnant lover, the titan goddess Metis, who was carrying their daughter, Athena. The mother and child created havoc inside Zeus. Either Hermes or Hephaestus split Zeus&#x27;s head, allowing Athena, in full battle armor, to burst forth from his forehead. Athena was thus described as being &quot;born&quot; from Zeus. The outcome pleased Zeus as it didn&#x27;t fulfill the prophecy of Themis which (according to Aeschylus) predicted that Zeus will one day bear a son that would overthrow him. 

=== Celtic myth and society ===
According to Adler, &quot;there &quot;is&quot; plenty of evidence of ancient societies where women held greater power than in many societies today. For example, Jean Markale&#x27;s studies of Celtic societies show that the power of women was reflected not only in myth and legend but in legal codes pertaining to marriage, divorce, property ownership, and the right to rule...although this was overthrown by the patriarchy.&quot;

=== Basque myth and society ===
The hypothesis of Basque matriarchism or theory of Basque matriarchism is a theoretical proposal launched by Andrés Ortiz-Osés that maintains that the existence of a psychosocial structure centered or focused on the matriarchal-feminine archetype (mother / woman, which finds in the archetype of the great Basque mother Mari, her precipitate as a projection of Mother Earth / nature) that &quot;permeates, coagulates and unites the traditional Basque social group in a way that is different from the patriarchal Indo-European peoples&quot;.

This mythical matriarchal conception corresponds to the conception of the Basques, clearly reflected in their mythology. The Earth is the mother of the Sun and the Moon, compared to Indo-European patriarchal conceptions, where the sun is reflected as a God, numen or male spirit. Prayers and greetings were dedicated to these two sisters at dawn and dusk, when they returned to the bosom of Mother Earth.

Franz-Karl Mayr, this philosopher argued that the archetypal background of Basque mythology had to be inscribed in the context of a Paleolithic dominated by the Great Mother, in which the cycle of Mari (goddess) and her metamorphoses offers all a typical symbolism of the matriarchal-naturalistic context. According to the archetype of the Great Mother, this is usually related to fertility cults, as in the case of Mari, who is the determinant of fertility-fecundity, the maker of rain or hail, that on whose telluric forces depend the crops, in space and time, life and death, luck (grace) and misfortune.

=== South America ===
Bamberger (1974) examines several matriarchal myths from South American cultures and concludes that portraying the women from this matriarchal period as immoral often serves to restrain contemporary women in these societies, providing reason for the overthrow by the patriarchy. 

== In feminist thought ==
While &quot;matriarchy&quot; has mostly fallen out of use for the anthropological description of existing societies, it remains current as a concept in feminism.
In first-wave feminist discourse, either Elizabeth Cady Stanton or Margaret Fuller (it is unclear who was first) introduced the concept of matriarchy and the discourse was joined in by Matilda Joslyn Gage. Victoria Woodhull, in 1871, called for men to open the U.S. government to women or a new constitution and government would be formed in a year; and, on a basis of equality, she ran to be elected president in 1872. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in 1911 and 1914, argued for &quot;a woman-centered, or better mother-centered, world&quot; and described &quot;government by women&quot;. She argued that a government led by either sex must be assisted by the other, both genders being &quot;useful ... and should in our governments be alike used&quot;, because men and women have different qualities.

Cultural feminism includes &quot;matriarchal worship&quot;, according to Prof. James Penner.

In feminist literature, matriarchy and patriarchy are not conceived as simple mirrors of each other. While &quot;matriarchy&quot; sometimes means &quot;the political rule of women&quot;, that meaning is often rejected, on the ground that matriarchy is not a mirroring of patriarchy. Patriarchy is held to be about power over others while matriarchy is held to be about power from within, Starhawk having written on that distinction and Adler having argued that matriarchal power is not possessive and not controlling, but is harmonious with nature, arguing that women are uniquely capable of using power without exploitative purposes.

For radical feminists, the importance of matriarchy is that &quot;veneration for the female principle ... somewhat lightens an oppressive system.&quot;

Feminist utopias are a form of advocacy. According to Tineke Willemsen, &quot;a feminist utopia would ... be the description of a place where at least women would like to live.&quot; Willemsen continues, among &quot;type[s] of feminist utopias[,] ... [one] stem[s] from feminists who emphasize the differences between women and men. They tend to formulate their ideal world in terms of a society where women&#x27;s positions are better than men&#x27;s. There are various forms of matriarchy, or even a utopia that resembles the Greek myth of the Amazons... [V]ery few modern utopias have been developed in which women are absolute autocrats.&quot;

A minority of feminists, generally radical, have argued that women should govern societies of women and men. In all of these advocacies, the governing women are not limited to mothers:
* In her book &quot;Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel, and Women&#x27;s Liberation&quot;, Andrea Dworkin stated that she wanted women to have their own country, &quot;Womenland,&quot; which, comparable to Israel, would serve as a &quot;place of potential refuge&quot;. In the &quot;Palestine Solidarity Review&quot;, Veronica A. Ouma reviewed the book and argued her view that while Dworkin &quot;pays lip service to the egalitarian nature of ... [stateless] societies [without hierarchies], she envisions a state whereby women either impose gender equality or a state where females rule supreme above males.&quot;
* Starhawk, in &quot;The Fifth Sacred Thing&quot; (1993), fiction, wrote of &quot;a utopia where women are leading societies but are doing so with the consent of men.&quot;
* Phyllis Chesler wrote in &quot;Women and Madness&quot; (2005 and 1972) that feminist women must &quot;&quot;dominate&quot; public and social institutions&quot;. She also wrote that women fare better when controlling the means of production and that equality with men should not be supported, even if female domination is no more &quot;just&quot; than male domination. On the other hand, in 1985, she was &quot;probably more of a feminist-anarchist ... more mistrustful of the organisation of power into large bureaucratic states [than she was in 1972]&quot;. Between Chesler&#x27;s 1972 and 2005 editions, Dale Spender wrote that Chesler &quot;takes [as] a ... stand [that] ... [e]quality is a spurious goal, and of no use to women: the only way women can protect themselves is if they &quot;dominate&quot; particular institutions and can use them to serve women&#x27;s interests. Reproduction is a case in point.&quot; Spender wrote Chesler &quot;remarks ... women will be superior&quot;.
* Monique Wittig authored, as fiction (not as fact), &quot;Les Guérillères&quot;, with her description of an asserted &quot;female State&quot;. The work was described by Rohrlich as a &quot;fictional counterpart&quot; to &quot;so-called Amazon societies&quot;. Scholarly interpretations of the fictional work include that women win a war against men, &quot;reconcil[e]&quot; with &quot;those men of good will who come to join them&quot;, exercise feminist autonomy through polyandry, decide how to govern, and rule the men. The women confronting men are, according to Tucker Farley, diverse and thus stronger and more united and, continued Farley, permit a &quot;few ... men, who are willing to accept a feminist society of primitive communism, ... to live.&quot; Another interpretation is that the author created an open structure&#x27; of freedom&quot;.
* Mary Daly wrote of hag-ocracy, &quot;the place we [&quot;women traveling into feminist time/space&quot;] govern&quot;, and of reversing phallocratic rule in the 1990s (&quot;i.e.&quot;, when published). She considered equal rights as tokenism that works against sisterhood, even as she supported abortion being legal and other reforms. She considered her book pro-female and anti-male.
* Rasa von Werder has also long advocated for a return to matriarchy, a restoration of its status before its overthrow by patriarchy, along with associated author William Bond as well.

Some such advocacies are informed by work on the matriarchies of the past:
* According to Prof. , &quot;an ancient matriarchy ... [was &quot;in early second-wave feminism&quot;] the lost object of women&#x27;s freedom.&quot; Prof. Cynthia Eller found widespread acceptance of matriarchal myth during feminism&#x27;s second wave. According to Kathryn Rountree, the belief in a prepatriarchal &quot;Golden Age&quot; of matriarchy may have been more specifically about a matrifocal society, although this was believed more in the 1970s than in the 1990s–2000s and was criticized within feminism and within archaeology, anthropology, and theological study as lacking a scholarly basis, and Prof. Harvey C. Mansfield wrote that &quot;the evidence [is] ... of males ruling over all societies at almost all times&quot;. Eller said that, other than a few separatist radical lesbian feminists, spiritual feminists would generously include &quot;a place for men ... in which they can be happy and productive, if not necessarily powerful and in control&quot; and might have social power as well.
* Jill Johnston envisioned a &quot;return to the former glory and wise equanimity of the matriarchies&quot; in the future and &quot;imagined lesbians as constituting an imaginary radical state, and invoked &#x27;the return to the harmony of statehood and biology... Her work inspired efforts at implementation by the Lesbian Organization of Toronto (LOOT) in 1976–1980 and in Los Angeles.
* Elizabeth Gould Davis believed that a &quot;matriarchal counterrevolution [replacing &quot;a[n old] patriarchal revolution&quot;] ... is the only hope for the survival of the human race.&quot; She believed that &quot;spiritual force&quot;, &quot;mental and spiritual gifts&quot;, and &quot;extrasensory perception&quot; will be more important and therefore that &quot;woman will ... predominate&quot;, and that it is &quot;about ... [&quot;woman&quot; that] the next civilization will ... revolve&quot;, as in the kind of past that she believed existed. According to critic Prof. Ginette Castro, Elizabeth Gould Davis used the words &quot;matriarchy&quot; and &quot;gynocracy&quot; &quot;interchangeably&quot; and proposed a discourse &quot;rooted in the purest female chauvinism&quot; and seemed to support &quot;a feminist counterattack stigmatizing the patriarchal present&quot;, &quot;giv[ing] ... in to a revenge-seeking form of feminism&quot;, &quot;build[ing] ... her case on the humiliation of men&quot;, and &quot;asserti[ng] ... a specifically feminine nature ... [as] morally superior.&quot; Castro criticized Elizabeth Gould Davis&#x27; essentialism and assertion of superiority as &quot;sexist&quot; and &quot;treason&quot;.
* One organization that was named The Feminists was interested in matriarchy and was one of the largest of the radical feminist women&#x27;s liberation groups of the 1960s. Two members wanted &quot;the restoration of female rule&quot;, but the organization&#x27;s founder, Ti-Grace Atkinson, would have objected had she remained in the organization, because, according to a historian, &quot;[she] had always doubted that women would wield power differently from men.&quot;

* Robin Morgan wrote of women fighting for and creating a &quot;gynocratic &quot;world&quot;&quot;.
* Adler reported, &quot;if feminists have diverse views on the matriarchies of the past, they also are of several minds on the goals for the future. A woman in the coven of Ursa Maior told me, &#x27;right now I am pushing for women&#x27;s power in any way I can, but I don&#x27;t know whether my ultimate aim is a society where all human beings are equal, regardless of the bodies they were born into, or whether I would rather see a society where women had institutional authority.

Some fiction caricatured the current gender hierarchy by describing an inverted matriarchal alternative without necessarily advocating for it. According to Karin Schönpflug, &quot;Gerd Brantenberg&#x27;s &quot;Egalia&#x27;s Daughters&quot; is a caricature of powered gender relations which have been completely reversed, with the female sex on the top and the male sex a degraded, oppressed group&quot;; &quot;gender inequality is expressed through power inversion&quot; and &quot;all gender roles are reversed and women rule over a class of intimidated, effeminate men&quot; compelled into that submissive gender role. &quot;&quot;Egalia&quot; is not a typical example of gender inequality in the sense that a vision of a desirable matriarchy is created; &quot;Egalia&quot; is more a caricature of male hegemony by twisting gender hierarchy but not really offering a &#x27;better world.

On egalitarian matriarchy, Heide Göttner-Abendroth&#x27;s International Academy for Modern Matriarchal Studies and Matriarchal Spirituality (HAGIA) organized conferences in Luxembourg in 2003 and Texas in 2005, with papers published. Göttner-Abendroth argued that &quot;matriarchies are all egalitarian at least in terms of gender—they have no gender hierarchy ... [, that, f]or many matriarchal societies, the social order is completely egalitarian at both local and regional levels&quot;, that, &quot;for our own path toward new egalitarian societies, we can gain ... insight from ... [&quot;tested&quot;] matriarchal patterns&quot;, and that &quot;matriarchies are not abstract &quot;utopias&quot;, constructed according to philosophical concepts that could never be implemented.&quot;

According to Eller, &quot;a deep distrust of men&#x27;s ability to adhere to&quot; future matriarchal requirements may invoke a need &quot;to retain at least some degree of female hegemony to insure against a return to patriarchal control&quot;, &quot;feminists ... [having] the understanding that female dominance is better for society—and better for men—than the present world order&quot;, as is equalitarianism. On the other hand, Eller continued, if men can be trusted to accept equality, probably most feminists seeking future matriarchy would accept an equalitarian model.

&quot;Demographic[ally]&quot;, &quot;feminist matriarchalists run the gamut&quot; but primarily are &quot;in white, well-educated, middle-class circles&quot;; many of the adherents are &quot;religiously inclined&quot; while others are &quot;quite secular&quot;.

Biology as a ground for holding either males or females superior over the other has been criticized as invalid, such as by Andrea Dworkin and by Robin Morgan. A claim that women have unique characteristics that prevent women&#x27;s assimilation with men has been apparently rejected by Ti-Grace Atkinson. On the other hand, not all advocates based their arguments on biology or essentialism.

A criticism by Mansfield of choosing who governs according to gender or sex is that the best qualified people should be chosen, regardless of gender or sex. On the other hand, Mansfield considered merit insufficient for office, because a legal right granted by a sovereign (&quot;e.g.&quot;, a king), was more important than merit.

Diversity within a proposed community can, according to Becki L. Ross, make it especially challenging to complete forming the community. However, some advocacy includes diversity, in the views of Dworkin and Farley.

Prof. Christine Stansell, a feminist, wrote that, for feminists to achieve state power, women must democratically cooperate with men. &quot;Women must take their place with a new generation of brothers in a struggle for the world&#x27;s fortunes. Herland, whether of virtuous matrons or daring sisters, is not an option... [T]he well-being and liberty of women cannot be separated from democracy&#x27;s survival.&quot; (&quot;Herland&quot; was feminist utopian fiction by Charlotte Perkins Gilman in 1911, featuring a community entirely of women except for three men who seek it out, strong women in a matriarchal utopia expected to last for generations, demonstrated a marked era of peace and personal satisfaction, although Charlotte Perkins Gilman was herself a feminist advocate of society being gender-integrated and of women&#x27;s freedom.)

Other criticisms of matriarchy are that it could result in reverse sexism or discrimination against men, that it is opposed by most people including most feminists, or that many women do not want leadership positions. governing takes women away from family responsibilities, women are too likely to be unable to serve politically because of menstruation and pregnancy, public affairs are too sordid for women and would cost women their respect and femininity (apparently including fertility), superiority is not traditional, women lack the political capacity and authority men have, it is impractical because of a shortage of women with the ability to govern at that level of difficulty as well as the desire and ability to wage war, women are less aggressive, or less often so, than are men and politics is aggressive, women legislating would not serve men&#x27;s interests or would serve only petty interests, it is contradicted by current science on genderal differences, it is unnatural, and, in the views of a playwright and a novelist, &quot;women cannot govern on their own.&quot; On the other hand, another view is that &quot;women have &#x27;empire&#x27; over men&quot; because of nature and &quot;men ... are actually obeying&quot; women.

Pursuing a future matriarchy would tend to risk sacrificing feminists&#x27; position in present social arrangements, and many feminists are not willing to take that chance, according to Eller. &quot;Political feminists tend to regard discussions of what utopia would look like as a good way of setting themselves up for disappointment&quot;, according to Eller, and argue that immediate political issues must get the highest priority.

&quot;Matriarchists&quot;, as typified by male-conceived comic book character Wonder Woman, were criticized by Kathie Sarachild, Carol Hanisch, and some others.

== In religious thought ==

=== Exclusionary ===
Some theologies and theocracies limit or forbid women from being in civil government or public leadership or forbid them from voting, effectively criticizing and forbidding matriarchy. Within none of the following religions is the respective view necessarily universally held:
* In Islam, some Muslim scholars hold a view that female political leadership should be restricted, according to . The restriction has been attributed to a hadith of Muhammad, the founder and last prophet of Islam. The hadith says, according to Roald, &quot;a people which has a woman as leader will never prosper.&quot; The hadith&#x27;s transmission, context, and meaning have been questioned, wrote Roald. According to Roald, the prohibition has also been attributed as an extension of a ban on women leading prayers &quot;in mixed gatherings&quot;. Possibly, Roald noted, the hadith applies only against being head of state and not other high office. One source, wrote Roald, would allow a woman to &quot;occupy every position except that of &quot;khalīfa&quot; (the leader of all Sunni Muslims).&quot; One exception to the head-of-state prohibition was accepted without a general acceptance of women in political leadership, Roald reported. Political activism at lower levels may be more acceptable to Islamist women than top leadership positions, said Roald. The Muslim Brotherhood has stated that women may not be president or head of state but may hold other public offices but, &quot;as for judiciary office, ... [t]he majority of jurispudents ... have forbidden it completely.&quot; In a study of 82 Islamists in Europe, according to Roald, 80% said women could not be state leaders but 75% said women could hold other high positions. In 1994, the Muslim Brotherhood said that &quot;social circumstances and traditions&quot; may justify gradualism in the exercise of women&#x27;s right to hold office (below head of state). Whether the Muslim Brothers still support that statement is unclear. As reported in 1953, Roald reported later, &quot;Islamic organizations held a conference in the office of the Muslim Brothers ... [and] claim[ed] ... that it had been proven that political rights for women were contrary to religion&quot;. Some nations have specific bans. In Iran at times, according to Elaheh Rostami Povey, women have been forbidden to fill some political office roles because of law or because of judgments made under the Islamic religion. According to Steven Pinker, in a 2001–2007 Gallup poll of 35 nations having 90% of the world&#x27;s Muslims, &quot;substantial majorities of both sexes in all the major Muslim countries say that women should be allowed to vote without influence from men ... and to serve in the highest levels of government.&quot;
* In Rabbinical Judaism, among orthodox leaders, a position, beginning before Israel became a modern state, has been that for women to hold public office in Israel would threaten the state&#x27;s existence, according to educator Tova Hartman, who reports the view has &quot;wide consensus&quot;. When Israel ratified the international women&#x27;s equality agreement known as CEDAW, according to Marsha Freeman, it reserved nonenforcement for any religious communities that forbid women from sitting on religious courts. According to Freeman, &quot;the tribunals that adjudicate marital issues are by religious law and by custom entirely male.&quot; Men&#x27;s superiority&#x27; is a fundamental tenet in Judaism&quot;, according to Irit Umanit. According to Freeman, Likud party-led &quot;governments have been less than hospitable to women&#x27;s high-level participation.&quot;
* In Buddhism, according to Karma Lekshe Tsomo, some hold that &quot;the Buddha allegedly hesitated to admit women to the Saṅgha ...&quot; because their inclusion would hasten the demise of the monastic community and the very teachings of Buddhism itself. &quot;In certain Buddhist countries—Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, and Thailand—women are categorically denied admission to the Saṅgha, Buddhism&#x27;s most fundamental institution&quot;, according to Tsomo. Tsomo wrote, &quot;throughout history, the support of the Saṅgha has been actively sought as a means of legitimation by those wishing to gain and maintain positions of political power in Buddhist countries.&quot;
* Among Hindus in India, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, &quot;India&#x27;s most extensive all-male Hindu nationalist organization,&quot; has debated whether women can ever be Hindu nationalist political leaders but without coming to a conclusion, according to Paola Bacchetta. The Rashtriya Sevika Samiti, a counterpart organization composed of women, believes that women can be Hindu nationalist political leaders and has trained two in Parliament, but considers women only as exceptions, the norm for such leadership being men.

* In Protestant Christianity, considered only historically, in 1558, John Knox (Maria Stuart&#x27;s subject) wrote &quot;The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women&quot;. According to Scalingi, the work is &quot;perhaps the best known analysis of gynecocracy&quot; and Knox was &quot;the most notorious&quot; writer on the subject. According to an 1878 edition, Knox&#x27;s objection to any women reigning and having &quot;empire&quot; over men was theological and it was against nature for women to bear rule, superiority, dominion, or empire above any realm, nation, or city. Susan M. Felch said that Knox&#x27;s argument was partly grounded on a statement of the apostle Paul against women teaching or usurping authority over men. According to Maria Zina Gonçalves de Abreu, Knox argued that a woman being a national ruler was unnatural and that women were unfit and ineligible for the post. Kathryn M. Brammall said Knox &quot;considered the rule of female monarchs to be anathema to good government&quot; and that Knox &quot;also attacked those who obeyed or supported female leaders&quot;, including men. Robert M. Healey said that Knox objected to women&#x27;s rule even if men accepted it. On whether Knox personally endorsed what he wrote, according to Felch, Jasper Ridley, in 1968, argued that even Knox may not have personally believed his stated position but may have merely pandered to popular sentiment, itself a point disputed by W. Stanford Reid. On the popularity of Knox&#x27;s views, Patricia-Ann Lee said Knox&#x27;s &quot;fierce attack on the legitimacy of female rule ... [was one in which] he said ... little that was unacceptable ... to most of his contemporaries&quot;, although Judith M. Richards disagreed on whether the acceptance was quite so widespread. According to David Laing&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to Knox&#x27;s work, Knox&#x27;s views were agreed with by some people at the time, the &quot;Preface&quot; saying, &quot;[Knox&#x27;s] views were in harmony with those of his colleagues ... [Goodman, Whittingham, and Gilby]&quot;. Writing in agreement with Knox was Christopher Goodman, who, according to Lee, &quot;considered the woman ruler to be a monster in nature, and used ... scriptural argument to prove that females were barred ... from any political power&quot;, even if, according to Richards, the woman was &quot;virtuous&quot;. Some views included conditionality; while John Calvin said, according to Healey, &quot;that government by a woman was a deviation from the original and proper order of nature, and therefore among the punishments humanity incurred for original sin&quot;. Nonetheless, Calvin would not always question a woman&#x27;s right to inherit rule of a realm or principality. Heinrich Bullinger, according to Healey, &quot;held that rule by a woman was contrary to God&#x27;s law but cautioned against [always] using that reason to oppose such rule&quot;. According to Richards, Bullinger said women were normally not to rule. Around 1560, Calvin, in disagreeing with Knox, argued that the existence of the few women who were exceptions showed that theological ground existed for their exceptionalism. Knox&#x27;s view was much debated in Europe at the time, the issue considered complicated by laws such as on inheritance and since several women were already in office, including as Queens, according to de Abreu. Knox&#x27;s view is not said to be widely held in modern Protestantism among leadership or laity.

=== Inclusionary ===

According to Eller, feminist thealogy conceptualized humanity as beginning with &quot;female-ruled or equalitarian societies&quot;, until displaced by patriarchies, and that in the millennial future gynocentric,&#x27; life-loving values&quot; will return to prominence. This, according to Eller, produces &quot;a virtually infinite number of years of female equality or superiority coming both at the beginning and end of historical time&quot;.

Among criticisms is that a future matriarchy, according to Eller, as a reflection of spirituality, is conceived as ahistorical, and thus may be unrealistic, unreachable, or even meaningless as a goal to secular feminists.

==In popular culture==

===Ancient theatre===
* As criticism in 390 BC, Aristophanes wrote a play, &quot;Ecclesiazusae&quot;, about women gaining legislative power and governing Athens, Greece, on a limited principle of equality. In the play, according to Mansfield, Praxagora, a character, argues that women should rule because they are superior to men, not equal, and yet she declines to assert publicly her right to rule, although elected and although acting in office. The play, Mansfield wrote, also suggests that women would rule by not allowing politics, in order to prevent disappointment, and that affirmative action would be applied to heterosexual relationships. In the play, as Mansfield described it, written when Athens was a male-only democracy where women could not vote or rule, women were presented as unassertive and unrealistic, and thus not qualified to govern. The play, according to Sarah Ruden, was a fable on the theme that women should stay home.

===Literature===
* Elizabeth Burgoyne Corbett&#x27;s &quot;New Amazonia: A Foretaste of the Future&quot; is an early feminist utopian novel (published 1889), which is matriarchal in that all political leadership roles in New Amazonia are required to be held by women, according to Duangrudi Suksang.

* N. Lee Wood&#x27;s book &quot;Master of None&quot; (2004) is set in a &quot;closed matriarchal world where men have no legal rights&quot;, according to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;.
* Wen Spencer&#x27;s book &quot;A Brother&#x27;s Price&quot; (2005) is set in a world where, according to Page Traynor, &quot;women are in charge&quot;, &quot;boys are rare and valued but not free&quot;, and &quot;boys are kept at home to do the cooking and child caring until the time they marry&quot;.
* Elizabeth Bear&#x27;s &quot;Carnival&quot; (2006) introduces New Amazonia, a colony planet with a matriarchal and largely lesbian population who eschew the strict and ruthless population control and environmentalism instituted on Earth. The Amazonians are aggressive, warlike, and subjugate the few men they tolerate for reproduction and service, but they are also pragmatic and defensive of their freedom from the male-dominated Coalition that seeks to conquer them.
* In Naomi Alderman&#x27;s book, &quot;The Power&quot; (2016), women develop the ability to release electrical jolts from their fingers, thus leading them to become the dominant gender.
* Jean M. Auel&#x27;s &quot;Earth&#x27;s Children&quot; (1980–2011).

===Film===
* In the 2011 &quot;Disney&quot; animated film Mars Needs Moms&quot;, Mars is ruled by a female Martian known only as The Supervisor, who long ago deemed all male Martians to the trash underground and kept all females in functioning society. The film reveals The Supervisor, for an unexplained reason, changed how Martian society was being run (from children being raised by parents) to Martian children being raised by &quot;Nannybots&quot;. The Supervisor sacrifices one Earth mother every twenty-five years for that mother&#x27;s knowledge of order, discipline and control, which is transferred to the Nannybots who raise the female Martians.
* The 2023 film &quot;Barbie&quot; depicts a world (Barbieland) ruled entirely by Barbies in positions such as doctors, scientists, lawyers, and politicians while the Kens spend their time at the beach.

=== Television ===
* In the special The Powerpuff Girls Rule!!!, Blossom wanted society to based on the African Elephant; in which only women vote &amp; &quot;Stinky &amp; Dumb&quot; men are relegated to house tasks.
* In the Futurama episode Amazon Women in the Mood, the crew land on a planet ruled by giant muscular women.
* Fumi Yoshinaga&#x27;s manga Ōoku: The Inner Chambers, published between 2004 and 2020, follows an alternate history of Japan in which most of the male population is killed by a disease, resulting in a matriarchal society. It is best known in the United States by its 2023 Netflix adaptation of the same name.

==Other animals==

Matriarchy may also refer to non-human animal species in which females hold higher status and hierarchical positions, such as among spotted hyenas, elephants, lemurs, naked mole rats, and bonobos. Such animal hierarchies have not been replaced by patriarchy. The social structure of European bison herds has also been described by specialists as a matriarchy – the cows of the group lead it as the entire herd follows them to grazing areas. Though heavier and larger than the females, the older and more powerful males of the European bison usually fulfill the role of satellites that hang around the edges of the herd. Apart from the mating season when they begin to compete with each other, European bison bulls serve a more active role in the herd only once a danger to the group&#x27;s safety appears. In bonobos, even the highest ranking male will sometimes face aggression from females and is occasionally injured by them. Female bonobos secure feeding privileges and exude social confidence while the males generally cower on the sidelines. The only exceptions are males with influential mothers, so even the rank between the males is influenced strongly by females. Females also initiate group travels.

<doc id="83529" wikidata="Q737624" url="?curid=83529" title="Vieques, Puerto Rico">
<text>Vieques (; ), officially Isla de Vieques, is an island, town and municipality of Puerto Rico, and together with Culebra, it is geographically part of the Spanish Virgin Islands. Vieques lies about east of the mainland of Puerto Rico, measuring about long and wide. Its most populated barrio is the town of Isabel Segunda (or &quot;Isabel the Second&quot;, sometimes written &quot;Isabel II&quot;), the administrative center located on the northern side of the island. The population of Vieques was 8,249 at the 2020 Census.

The island&#x27;s name is a Spanish spelling of a Taíno word said to mean &quot;small island&quot; or &quot;small land&quot;. It also has the nickname &quot;Isla Nena&quot;, usually translated as &quot;girl island&quot; or &quot;little girl island&quot;, alluding to its perception as Puerto Rico&#x27;s little sister. The island was given this name by the Puerto Rican poet Luís Lloréns Torres. During the British colonial period, its name was Crab Island.

Vieques is best known internationally as the site of a series of protests, held against the United States Navy&#x27;s use of the island as a bombing range and testing-ground, leading to the Navy&#x27;s departure in 2003. Today, the former navy lands are a national wildlife refuge; some of it is open to the public, but much remains closed off due to biological or chemical contamination or unexploded ordnance that the military is, slowly, cleaning up.

Some of the most beautiful beaches on the island are on the eastern end (former site of the Marine Base) that the Navy named Red Beach, Blue Beach, Caracas Beach, Pata Prieta Beach, La Chiva Beach, and Plata Beach. At the far western tip (formerly the Navy Base) is Punta Arenas, which the Navy named &#x27;Green Beach&#x27;. The beaches are commonly listed among the top in the Caribbean for their azure waters and white sands.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian history===
Archaeological evidence suggests that Vieques was first inhabited by ancient Indigenous peoples of the Americas who traveled mostly from South America perhaps between 3000 BCE and 2000 BCE. Estimates of these prehistoric dates of inhabitation vary widely. These tribes had a Stone Age culture and were probably fishermen and hunter-gatherers.

Excavations at the Puerto Ferro site by Luis Chanlatte and Yvonne Narganes uncovered a fragmented human skeleton in a large hearth area. Radiocarbon dating of shells found in the hearth indicate a burial date of c. 1900 BCE. This skeleton, popularly known as &quot;El Hombre de Puerto Ferro&quot;, was buried at the center of a group of large boulders near Vieques&#x27;s south-central coast, approximately one kilometer northwest of the Bioluminescent Bay. Linear arrays of smaller stones radiating from the central boulders are apparent at the site today, but their age and reason for placement are unknown.

Further waves of settlement by Native Americans followed over many centuries. The Arawak-speaking Saladoid (or Igneri) people, thought to have originated in modern-day Venezuela, arrived in the region perhaps around 200 BC (estimates vary). These tribes, noted for their pottery, stone carving, and other artifacts, eventually merged with groups from Hispaniola and Cuba to form what is now called the Taíno culture. This culture flourished in the region from around 1000 AD until the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century.

===Spanish colonial period===
The European discovery of Vieques is sometimes credited to Christopher Columbus, who landed in Puerto Rico in 1493. It does not seem to be certain whether Columbus personally visited Vieques, but in any case the island was soon claimed by the Spanish. During the early 16th century Vieques became a center of Taíno rebellion against the European invaders, prompting the Spanish to send armed forces to the island to quell the resistance. The native Taíno population was decimated, and its people either killed, imprisoned or enslaved by the Spanish.

The Spanish did not, however, permanently colonize Vieques at this time, and for the next 300 years it remained a lawless outpost, frequented by pirates and outlaws. As European powers fought for control in the region, a series of attempts by the French, English and Danish to colonize the island in the 17th and 18th centuries were repulsed by the Spanish.

At the beginning of the 19th century, the Spanish took steps to permanently settle and secure the island. In 1811, Don Salvador Meléndez, then governor of Puerto Rico, sent military commander Juan Rosselló to begin what would become the annexation of Vieques by the Puerto Ricans.

In 1832, under an agreement with the Spanish Puerto Rican administration, Frenchman Teófilo José Jaime María Le Guillou became Governor of Vieques, and undertook to impose order on the anarchic province. He was instrumental in the establishment of large plantations, marking a period of social and economic change. Le Guillou is now remembered as the &quot;founder of Vieques&quot; (though this title is also sometimes conferred on Francisco Saínz, governor from 1843 to 1852, who founded Isabel Segunda, the main town in Vieques, named after Queen Isabel II of Spain). Vieques was formally annexed to Puerto Rico in 1854.

In 1816, Vieques was briefly visited by Simón Bolívar when his ship ran aground there while fleeing defeat in Venezuela.

During the second part of the 19th century, thousands of slaves of African descent were brought to Vieques to work the sugarcane plantations. They arrived from mainland Puerto Rico and nearby islands of St. Thomas, Nevis, Saint Kitts, Saint Croix, and many other Caribbean islands. Slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico in 1873.

===European colonial period===

The island also received considerable attention as a possible colony from Scotland, and after numerous attempts to buy the island proved unsuccessful, the Scottish fleet, en route to Darien in 1698, made landfall and took possession of the island in the name of the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and The Indies. Scottish sovereignty of the island proved short-lived, as a Danish ship arrived shortly afterward and claimed the island. From 1689 to 1693, the island was controlled by Brandenburg-Prussia as Krabbeninsel (German &quot;crab island&quot;), where the English name Crab Island came from.

===United States control===

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Vieques was 6,642 (but this included 704 residents from a nearby island, Culebra).

In the 1920s and 1930s, the sugar industry, on which Vieques was dependent, went into decline due to falling prices and industrial unrest. Many locals were forced to move to mainland Puerto Rico or Saint Croix to look for work.

In 1941, while Europe was in the midst of World War II, the United States Navy purchased or seized almost eighty percent of Vieques as an extension to the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station nearby on the Puerto Rican mainland. It is said that the original purpose of the base (never implemented) was to provide a safe haven for the British fleet and the British royal family should Great Britain fall to Nazi Germany. This assertion does not match U.S. Navy documents and the obvious fact that Canada&#x27;s Halifax harbor would have been a more likely fallback position for the British fleet, with British King George VI already reigning as King of Canada. The base was however seen as the Atlantic&#x27;s counterpart of Pearl Harbor in the Pacific due to its strategic location. The Naval Station at Roosevelt Roads was a perfect location to defend the strategic approaches to the Panama Canal.

Much of the land was bought from the owners of large farms and sugar cane plantations, and the expropriations triggered the final demise of the sugar industry. Without consulting the local population who had lived and worked there for centuries and protested the expropriations, the decision to turn it into a bombing range was made in Washington. In a similar way as the former population of the Chagos Islands, who were displaced to make way for an Air Force Base in the Indian Ocean in the 1960s, many agricultural workers, who had no formal title to the land they occupied, were evicted and forced to migrate.

For over sixty years, the US military used the island (with a population of over 9000 inhabitants in 1950) as a live munitions target practice. According to internal Navy documents, bombardments occurred on 180 days out of a year on average. The US military used the highest possible contaminant depleted uranium (DU) munitions since 1972 on the populated (and full of exotic wildlife) island, at a rate of over 80 live bombs daily for decades. The health consequences are felt to this day as the cancer rates are ostensibly higher for the population of Vieques, especially children, than for those on the main island.

After the war, the US Navy continued to use the island for military exercises, and as a firing range and testing ground for munitions.

===Protests and departure of the United States Navy===
The continuing postwar presence in Vieques of the United States Navy drew protests from the local community, angry at the expropriation of their land and the environmental impact of weapons testing. The locals&#x27; discontent was exacerbated by the island&#x27;s perilous economic condition.

Protests came to a head in 1999 when Vieques native David Sanes, a civilian employee of the United States Navy, was killed by a jet bomb that the Navy said misfired. Sanes had been working as a security guard. A popular campaign of civil disobedience resurged; not since the mid-1970s had &quot;Viequenses&quot; come together &quot;en masse&quot; to protest the target practices. The locals took to the ocean in their small fishing boats and successfully stopped the US Navy&#x27;s military exercises for a short period, until the US Navy and two US Coast Guard cutters began controlling access to the island and escorting boaters away from Vieques.

On April 27, 2001, the Navy resumed operations and protesting resumed. At this point over 600 protesters had already been detained.

The Vieques issue became something of a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;, and local protesters were joined by sympathetic groups and prominent individuals from the mainland United States and abroad, including political leaders Rubén Berríos, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, singers Danny Rivera, Willie Colón and Ricky Martin, actors Edward James Olmos and Jimmy Smits, boxer Félix &#x27;Tito&#x27; Trinidad, baseball superstar Carlos Delgado, writers Ana Lydia Vega and Giannina Braschi, and Guatemala&#x27;s Nobel Prize winner Rigoberta Menchú. Kennedy&#x27;s son, Aidan Caohman &quot;Vieques&quot; Kennedy, was born while his father served jail time in Puerto Rico for his role in the protests. The problems arising from the US Navy base have also featured in songs by various musicians, including Puerto Rican rock band Puya, rapper Immortal Technique and reggaeton artist Tego Calderón. In popular culture, one subplot of &quot;The Two Bartlets&quot; episode of The West Wing dealt with a protest on the bombing range led by a friend of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman; the character was modeled on future West Wing star Jimmy Smits, a native of Puerto Rico who was repeatedly arrested for leading protests there.

As a result of this pressure, in May 2003 the Navy withdrew from Vieques, and much of the island was designated a National Wildlife Refuge under the control of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The island was also placed on the National Priorities List (NPL), the list of hazardous waste sites in the United States eligible for long-term remedial action (cleanup) financed by the federal Superfund program. Closure of Roosevelt Roads Naval Station followed in 2004, and prior to Hurricane Maria the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station was reopened.

A report by the Government Accountability Office was published in 2021 and estimated there were &quot;8 million items of material potentially presenting an explosive hazard, and approximately 109,000 munitions items: 41,000 projectiles; 32,000 bombs; 4,700 mortars; 1,300 rockets; 18,000 submunitions; and 12,000 grenades, flares, pyrotechnics, and other munitions&quot; that had been removed from the testing site, and that further cleanup was expected to continue by 2032.

===Hurricane Maria and rebuilding efforts===

Puerto Rico was struck by Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, and the storm caused widespread devastation and a near-total shutdown of the island&#x27;s tourism-based economy. The largest hotel on the island, &quot;The W,&quot; has not reopened since the storm, but most smaller hotels, bed and breakfasts, and Airbnb operators have resumed operations.

As of December 2019, the Susana Centeno Hospital in Vieques had not been repaired and remained shuttered. Expectant mothers had to travel to the main island of Puerto Rico to give birth. People needing dialysis had to travel to the main island. In November 2018, a mobile dialysis machine was delivered to a temporary clinic.

On January 21, 2020, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved $39.5 million to help rebuild its only hospital after damage caused by Hurricane Maria. FEMA approved the funding after the Office of Management and Budget agreed to provide money to rebuild the Susan Centeno community health center based on its &quot;replacement value.&quot;

The family of Jaideliz Moreno Ventura, 13, whose 2020 death was blamed on the lack of a functioning hospital and lifesaving medical equipment in Vieques, is suing the government for violation of human and civil rights. Funds for rebuilding the hospital were approved two weeks after Jaideliz&#x27;s death.

While Governor Pedro Pierluisi expected construction to begin on the hospital rebuild in 2022, it was delayed until 2023 with the holdup blamed on both construction complications on the island and further bureaucratic procedures by FEMA. As of November 2024, construction was not yet complete.

==Government==

Vieques is a municipio of Puerto Rico, translated as &quot;municipality&quot; and in this context roughly equivalent to &quot;township&quot;. All municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor, elected every four years. The current mayor of Vieques is José &quot;Junito&quot; Corcino Acevedo, of the New Progressive Party (PNP). He was first elected at the 2020 general elections.

The city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VIII, which is represented by two Senators. In 2024, Marissa Jiménez and Héctor Joaquín Sánchez Álvarez were elected as District Senators.
===Barrios===

Vieques is divided into eight barrios, including the downtown barrio called Isabel Segunda.

===Sectors===

Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) are further subdivided into smaller areas called (&quot;sectors&quot; in English). The types of &quot;sectores&quot; may vary, from normally &quot;sector&quot; to &quot;urbanización&quot; to &quot;reparto&quot; to &quot;barriada&quot; to &quot;residencial&quot;, among others.

===Special Communities===

 (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion. A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Vieques: Sector Gobeo in Barrio Florida, Bravos de Boston, 
Jagüeyes, Monte Carmelo, Pozo Prieto (Monte Santo) and Villa Borinquén.

==Geography==

Vieques measures about east-west, and three to north-south. It has a land area of and is located about to the east of Puerto Rico. To the north of Vieques is the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south, the Caribbean. The island of Culebra is about north of Vieques, and the United States Virgin Islands lie to the east. Vieques and Culebra, together with various small islets, make up the Spanish Virgin Islands, sometimes known as the Passage Islands.

The former US Navy lands, now wildlife reserves, occupy the entire eastern and western ends of Vieques, with the former live weapons testing site (known as the &quot;LIA&quot;, or &quot;Live Impact Area&quot;) at the extreme eastern tip. These areas are unpopulated. The former civilian area occupies very roughly the central third of the island and contains the towns of Isabel Segunda on the north coast, and Esperanza on the south.

Vieques has a terrain of rolling hills, with a central ridge running east–west. The highest point is Monte Pirata at . Geologically the island is composed of a mixture of volcanic bedrock, sedimentary rocks such as limestone and sandstone, and alluvial deposits of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. There are no permanent rivers or streams. Much former agricultural land has been reclaimed by nature due to prolonged disuse, and, apart from some small-scale farming in the central region, the island is largely covered by brush and subtropical dry forest. Around the coast lie palm-fringed sandy beaches interspersed with lagoons, mangrove swamps, salt flats and coral reefs.

A series of nearshore islets and rocks are part of the municipality of Vieques, clockwise starting at the northernmost:
*Roca Cucaracha (a rock of less than five meters in diameter)
*Isla Yallis 
*Roca Alcatraz 
*Cayo Conejo 
*Cayo Jalovita 
*Cayo Jalova 
*Isla Chiva 
*Cayo Chiva 
*Cayo de Tierra
*Cayo de Afuera (Cayo Real)

===Bioluminescent Bay===
The Vieques Bioluminescent Bay (also known as &quot;Puerto Mosquito&quot;, &quot;Mosquito Bay&quot;, or &quot;The Bio Bay&quot;), was declared the &quot;Brightest bioluminescent bay&quot; in the world by Guinness World Records in 2006, and is listed as a national natural landmark, one of five in Puerto Rico. The luminescence in the bay is caused by a microorganism, the dinoflagellate &quot;Pyrodinium bahamense&quot;, which glows whenever the water is disturbed, leaving a trail of neon blue.

A combination of factors creates the necessary conditions for bioluminescence: red mangrove trees surround the water (the organisms have been related to mangrove forests although mangrove is not necessarily associated with this species); a complete lack of modern development around the bay; the water is warm enough and deep enough; and a small channel to the ocean keeps the dinoflagellates in the bay. This small channel was created artificially, the result of attempts by the occupants of Spanish ships to choke off the bay from the ocean. The Spanish believed that the bioluminescence they encountered there while first exploring the area was the work of the devil and tried to block ocean water from entering the bay by dropping huge boulders in the channel. The Spanish only succeeded in preserving and increasing the luminescence in the now isolated bay.

Kayaking is permitted in the bay and may be arranged through local vendors.

===Climate===
Vieques has a warm, relatively dry, tropical climate. Temperatures vary little throughout the year, with average daily maxima ranging from in January to in September. Average daily minima are about 18 °F or 6 °C lower. Rainfall averages around per year, with the month of September being the wettest. The west of the island receives significantly more rainfall than the east. Prevailing winds are easterly.

Vieques is prone to tropical storms and at risk from hurricanes from June to November. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo caused considerable damage to the island, and in 2017, Hurricane Maria also caused major damage.

==Demographics==
===2020===
According to the 2020 Census, Vieques is the third-least populous municipality (after Maricao and Culebra) with a population of 8,249.

8.0% of the population is of non-Hispanic origin, making it the second-least Hispanic municipality in Puerto Rico after Culebra. This represents an increase from 2010, when only 5.7% of the population was non-Hispanic.

===2010===
The 2010 US census, showed the total population of Vieques was 9,301. 94.3% of the population are Hispanic or Latino (of any race). Natives of Vieques are known as .

===Language===
Both Spanish and English are recognized as official languages. Spanish is the primary language of most inhabitants.

==Economy==
The sugar industry, once the mainstay of the island&#x27;s economy, declined during the early 20th century, and finally collapsed in the 1940s when the US Navy took over much of the land on which the sugar cane plantations stood. After an initial naval construction phase, opportunities to make a living on the island were increased to include not only fishing or subsistence farming, but also Naval jobs. Crops grown on the island include avocados, bananas, coconuts, grains, papayas and sweet potatoes. A number of permanent local jobs were provided by the US Navy, and their economy benefited. Starting in the 1970s General Electric had employed a few hundred workers at a manufacturing plant but that plant subsequently closed. Unemployment was widespread, with consequent social problems. The 2000 US census reported a median household income in 1999 dollars of $9,331 (compared to $41,994 for the US as a whole), and 35.8% of the population of 16 years and over in the labor force (compared to 63.9% for the US as a whole).

Following the 2003 departure of the US Navy, the frail economy of the island was left in shambles, and efforts had to be made to redevelop the island&#x27;s agricultural economy, clean up contaminated areas of the former bombing ranges, and to develop Vieques as a tourist destination. The Navy cleanup is now the island&#x27;s largest employer, and has contributed over $20 million to the local economy over the last five years through salaries, housing, vehicles, taxes, and services. The Navy has provided specialized training to several local islanders.

==Tourism==

For sixty years the majority of Vieques was closed off by the US Navy, and the island remained almost entirely undeveloped for tourism. This lack of development is now marketed as a key attraction. Vieques is promoted under an ecotourism banner as a sleepy, unspoiled island of rural bucolic charm and pristine deserted beaches, and is rapidly becoming a popular destination.

Since the Navy&#x27;s departure, tensions on the island have been low, although land speculation by foreign developers and fears of overdevelopment have caused some resentment among local residents, and there are occasional reports of lingering anti-American sentiment.

The lands previously owned by the Navy have been turned over to the U.S. National Fish and Wildlife Service and the authorities of Puerto Rico and Vieques for management. The immediate bombing range area on the eastern tip of the island suffers from severe contamination, but the remaining areas are mostly open to the public, including many beautiful beaches that were inaccessible to civilians while the military was conducting training maneuvers.

Snorkeling is excellent, especially at Blue Beach (Bahía de la Chiva). Aside from archeological sites, such as La Hueca, and deserted beaches, a unique feature of Vieques is the presence of two pristine bioluminescent bays, including Mosquito Bay. Vieques is also famous for its paso fino horses, which are owned by locals and left to roam free over parts of the island.

In 2011, TripAdvisor listed Vieques among the Top 25 Beaches in the World, writing &quot;If you prefer your beaches without the accompanying commercial developments, Isla de Vieques is your tanning turf, with more than 40 beaches and not one traffic light.&quot;

As of summer 2020, travel to the island was restricted due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

===Festivals and events===

Vieques celebrates its patron saint festival in July. The is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment.

Other festivals and events celebrated in Vieques include:
* Three Kings Festival – (or Epiphany Festival) – January 6
* (Vieques Cultural Festival) – June
* – August/September

==Symbols==
The has an official flag and coat of arms.

===Flag===
The Vieques flag, approved in 1975, contains a representation of the municipal coat of arms and maintains its same symbolism. It consists of seven horizontal straight stripes, of equal width, four white and three blue, alternated. In its center is a green rhombus where a simplified design of the castle appears in yellow. The naval crown seen on the coat of arms is omitted from the flag.

===Coat of arms===
On a barry shield with silver and blue waves is a green rhombus with a gold castle and on top is a golden crown with silver sails. The silver and blue waves symbolize the sea around Vieques. In the green rhombus is a historic Vieques fort represented by the traditional Spanish heraldic castle.

==Transportation==
Vieques is served by Antonio Rivera Rodríguez Airport, which currently accommodates only small propeller-driven aircraft. Services to the island run from San Juan&#x27;s Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, Isla Grande Airport (20- to 30-minute flights) and from Ceiba Airport (5-minute flights) and to Culebra. Flights are also available between Vieques and Saint Croix, Tortola, Virgin Gorda and Saint Thomas.

Also, a ferry runs from Ceiba several times a day. The ferry service is administered by the Autoridad de Transporte Marítimo (ATM) in Puerto Rico. In 2019, governor Wanda Vázquez Garced said she would address the troubled, inconsistent ferry service between the islands and Ceiba.

There are 13 bridges in Vieques, none of them distinguished.

==Public health==

There have been claims linking Vieques&#x27; higher cancer rate to the long history of weapons testing on the island.

Nayda Figueroa, an epidemiologist for Puerto Rico&#x27;s Cancer Registry, stated that research showed Vieques&#x27; cancer rate from 1995 to 1999 was 31 percent higher than for the main island. Michael Thun, head of epidemiological research at the American Cancer Society, cautioned that the variations in the rates could be attributed to chance, given the small population on Vieques. 
A 2000 Nuclear Regulatory Commission report concluded that &quot;the public had not been exposed to depleted uranium contamination above normal background (naturally occurring) levels&quot;.

Surveys of the wreckage of a target ship in a shallow bay at the bombing range, however, revealed its identity to be that of the , a target ship in nuclear tests in the Pacific in 1958. By 2002, it was evident that thousands of tons of steel that had originally been irradiated in the 1958 nuclear tests was missing from the wreckage in the bay. That steel has been missing for over 35 years and is still unaccounted for by the US Navy, Environmental Protection Agency and US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Hundreds of steel drums of unknown origin were found among the wreckage. Their identity and contents have not been adequately verified.

In response to concerns about potential contamination from toxic metals and other chemicals, the ATSDR conducted a number of surveys in 1999–2002 to test Vieques&#x27; soil, water supply, air, fish and shellfish for harmful substances. The general conclusion of the ATSDR survey was that no public health hazard existed as a result of the Navy&#x27;s activities. However, scientists have pointed out that fish samples were drawn from local markets, which often import fish from other areas. Also sample sizes from each location were too small to provide compelling evidence for the lack of a public health danger (Wargo, Green Intelligence). The conclusions of the ATSDR report have more recently, , been questioned and discredited. A review is underway.

Casa Pueblo, a Puerto Rican environmental group, reported &quot;a series of studies pertaining to the flora and fauna of Vieques that clearly demonstrates sequestration of high levels of toxic elements in plant and animal tissue samples. Consequently, the ecological food web of the Vieques Island has been adversely impacted.&quot;

<text> ( ) or the Night of Broken Glass, also called the November pogrom(s) (, ), was a pogrom against Jews carried out by the Nazi Party&#x27;s (SA) and (SS) paramilitary forces along with some participation from the Hitler Youth and German civilians throughout Nazi Germany on 9–10 November 1938. The German authorities looked on without intervening. The euphemistic name comes from the shards of broken glass that littered the streets after the windows of Jewish-owned stores, buildings, and synagogues were smashed. The pretext for the attacks was the assassination, on 9 November 1938, of the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by Herschel Grynszpan, a 17-year-old German-born Polish Jew living in Paris.

Jewish homes, hospitals and schools were ransacked as attackers demolished buildings with sledgehammers. Rioters destroyed many hundreds of synagogues throughout Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland. Over 7,000 Jewish businesses were damaged or destroyed, and 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and incarcerated in concentration camps. British historian Martin Gilbert wrote that no event in the history of German Jews between 1933 and 1945 was so widely reported as it was happening, and the accounts from foreign journalists working in Germany drew worldwide attention. &quot;The Times&quot; of London observed on 11 November 1938: &quot;No foreign propagandist bent upon blackening Germany before the world could outdo the tale of burnings and beatings, of blackguardly assaults on defenceless and innocent people, which disgraced that country yesterday.&quot;

Estimates of fatalities caused by the attacks have varied. Early reports estimated that 91 Jews had been murdered. Modern analysis of German scholarly sources puts the figure much higher; when deaths from post-arrest maltreatment and subsequent suicides are included, the death toll reaches the hundreds, with Richard J. Evans estimating 638 deaths by suicide, with a total between one and two thousand. 
Historians view as a prelude to the Final Solution and the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust.

==Background==
===Early Nazi persecutions===

In the 1920s, most German Jews were fully integrated into the country&#x27;s society as citizens. They served in the army and navy and contributed to every field of German business, science and culture. Conditions for German Jews began to worsen after the appointment of Adolf Hitler (the Austrian-born leader of the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party) as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, and the Enabling Act (implemented 23 March 1933) which enabled the assumption of power by Hitler after the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933. From its inception, Hitler&#x27;s regime moved quickly to introduce anti-Jewish policies. Nazi propaganda alienated the 500,000 Jews living in Germany, who accounted for only 0.86% of the overall population, and framed them as an enemy responsible for Germany&#x27;s defeat in the First World War and for its subsequent economic disasters, such as the 1920s hyperinflation and the subsequent Great Depression. Beginning in 1933, the German government enacted a series of anti-Jewish laws restricting the rights of German Jews to earn a living, to enjoy full citizenship and to gain education, including the &quot;Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service&quot; of 7 April 1933, which forbade Jews to work in the civil service. The subsequent 1935 Nuremberg Laws stripped German Jews of their citizenship and prohibited Jews from marrying non-Jewish Germans.

These laws resulted in the exclusion and alienation of Jews from German social and political life. Many sought asylum abroad; hundreds of thousands emigrated, but as Chaim Weizmann wrote in 1936, &quot;The world seemed to be divided into two parts—those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter.&quot; The international Évian Conference on 6 July 1938 addressed the issue of Jewish and Romani immigration to other countries. By the time the conference took place, more than 250,000 Jews had fled Germany and Austria, which had been annexed by Germany in March 1938; more than 300,000 German and Austrian Jews continued to seek refuge and asylum from oppression. As the number of Jews and Romani wanting to leave increased, the restrictions against them grew, with many countries tightening their rules for admission. By 1938, Germany &quot;had entered a new radical phase in anti-Semitic activity&quot;. Some historians believe that the Nazi government had been contemplating a planned outbreak of violence against the Jews and were waiting for an appropriate provocation; there is evidence of this planning dating back to 1937. In a 1997 interview, the German historian Hans Mommsen claimed that a major motive for the pogrom was the desire of the &quot;Gauleiters&quot; of the NSDAP to seize Jewish property and businesses. Mommsen stated:

The need for money by the party organization stemmed from the fact that Franz Xaver Schwarz, the party treasurer, kept the local and regional organizations of the party short of money. In the fall of 1938, the increased pressure on Jewish property nourished the party&#x27;s ambition, especially since Hjalmar Schacht had been ousted as &quot;Reich&quot; minister for economics. This, however, was only one aspect of the origin of the November 1938 pogrom. The Polish government threatened to extradite all Jews who were Polish citizens but would stay in Germany, thus creating a burden of responsibility on the German side. The immediate reaction by the Gestapo was to push the Polish Jews—16,000 persons—over the borderline, but this measure failed due to the stubbornness of the Polish customs officers. The loss of prestige as a result of this abortive operation called for some sort of compensation. Thus, the overreaction to Herschel Grynszpan&#x27;s attempt against the diplomat Ernst vom Rath came into being and led to the November pogrom. The background of the pogrom was signified by a sharp cleavage of interests between the different agencies of party and state. While the Nazi party was interested in improving its financial strength on the regional and local level by taking over Jewish property, Hermann Göring, in charge of the Four-Year Plan, hoped to acquire access to foreign currency in order to pay for the import of needed raw material. Heydrich and Himmler were interested in fostering Jewish emigration. 

The Zionist leadership in the British Mandate of Palestine wrote in February 1938 that according to &quot;a very reliable private source—one which can be traced back to the highest echelons of the SS leadership&quot;, there was &quot;an intention to carry out a genuine and dramatic pogrom in Germany on a large scale in the near future&quot;.

===Expulsion of Polish Jews in Germany===
In August 1938, German authorities announced that residence permits for foreigners were being canceled and would have to be renewed. This included German-born Jews of foreign citizenship. Poland stated that it would renounce citizenship rights of Polish Jews living abroad for at least five years after the end of October, effectively making them stateless. In the so-called &quot;Polenaktion&quot;, more than 12,000 Polish Jews, among them the philosopher and theologian Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, and future literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki were expelled from Germany on 28 October 1938, on Hitler&#x27;s orders. They were ordered to leave their homes in a single night and were allowed only one suitcase per person to carry their belongings. As the Jews were taken away, their remaining possessions were seized as loot both by Nazi authorities and by neighbors.

The deportees were taken from their homes to railway stations and were put on trains to the Polish border, where Polish border guards sent them back into Germany. This stalemate continued for days in the pouring rain, with the Jews marching without food or shelter between the borders. Four thousand were granted entry into Poland, but the remaining 8,000 were forced to stay at the border. They waited there in harsh conditions to be allowed to enter Poland. A British newspaper told its readers that hundreds &quot;are reported to be lying about, penniless and deserted, in little villages along the frontier near where they had been driven out by the Gestapo and left.&quot; Conditions in the refugee camps &quot;were so bad that some actually tried to escape back into Germany and were shot&quot;, recalled a British woman who was sent to help those who had been expelled.

===Shooting of vom Rath===
Among those expelled was the family of Sendel and Riva Grynszpan, Polish Jews who had emigrated to Germany in 1911 and settled in Hanover, Germany. At the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961, Sendel Grynszpan recounted the events of their deportation from Hanover on the night of 27 October 1938: &quot;Then they took us in police trucks, in prisoners&#x27; lorries, about 20 men in each truck, and they took us to the railway station. The streets were full of people shouting: &quot;″Juden Raus! Auf Nach Palästina!″&quot;&quot; (&quot;Jews get out! Go to Palestine!&quot;). Their seventeen-year-old son Herschel was living in Paris with an uncle. Herschel received a postcard from his family from the Polish border, describing the family&#x27;s expulsion: &quot;No one told us what was up, but we realized this was going to be the end... We don&#x27;t have a penny. Could you send us something?&quot; He received the postcard on 3 November 1938.

On the morning of Monday, 7 November 1938, he purchased a revolver and a box of bullets, then went to the German embassy and asked to see an embassy official. After he was taken to the office of Nazi diplomat Ernst vom Rath, Grynszpan fired five bullets at Vom Rath, two of which hit him in the abdomen. Vom Rath was a professional diplomat with the Foreign Office who expressed anti-Nazi sympathies, largely based on the Nazis&#x27; treatment of the Jews and was under Gestapo investigation for being politically unreliable. However, he also argued that the anti-Semitic laws were &quot;necessary&quot; to allow the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; to flourish.

Grynszpan made no attempt to escape the French police and freely confessed to the shooting. In his pocket, he carried a postcard to his parents with the message, &quot;May God forgive me... I must protest so that the whole world hears my protest, and that I will do.&quot; It is widely assumed that the assassination was politically motivated, but historian Hans-Jürgen Döscher says the shooting may have been the result of a love affair gone wrong, and that Grynszpan and vom Rath had become intimate after they met in Le Boeuf sur le Toit, which was a popular meeting place for gay and bisexual men at the time.

The next day, the German government retaliated, barring Jewish children from German state elementary schools, indefinitely suspending Jewish cultural activities, and putting a halt to the publication of Jewish newspapers and magazines, including the three national German Jewish newspapers. A newspaper in Britain described the last move, which cut off the Jewish populace from their leaders, as &quot;intended to disrupt the Jewish community and rob it of the last frail ties which hold it together.&quot; Their rights as citizens had been stripped. One of the first legal measures issued was an order by Heinrich Himmler, commander of all German police, forbidding Jews to possess any weapons whatsoever and imposing a penalty of twenty years&#x27; confinement in a concentration camp upon every Jew found in possession of a weapon hereafter.

==Pogrom==

===Death of Ernst vom Rath===

Ernst vom Rath died of his wounds on 9 November 1938. Word of his death reached Hitler that evening while he was with several key members of the Nazi party at a dinner commemorating the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch. After intense discussions, Hitler left the assembly abruptly without giving his usual address. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels delivered the speech, in his place, and said that &quot;the Führer has decided that... demonstrations should not be prepared or organized by the party, but insofar as they erupt spontaneously, they are not to be hampered.&quot; The chief party judge Walter Buch later stated that the message was clear; with these words, Goebbels had commanded the party leaders to organize a pogrom.

Some leading party officials disagreed with Goebbels&#x27; actions, fearing the diplomatic crisis it would provoke. Heinrich Himmler wrote, &quot;I suppose that it is Goebbels&#x27;s megalomania... and stupidity which is responsible for starting this operation now, in a particularly difficult diplomatic situation.&quot; The Israeli historian Saul Friedländer believes that Goebbels had personal reasons for wanting to bring about &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. Goebbels had recently suffered humiliation for the ineffectiveness of his propaganda campaign during the Sudeten crisis, and was in some disgrace over an affair with a Czech actress, Lída Baarová. Goebbels needed a chance to improve his standing in the eyes of Hitler. At 1:20 a.m. on 10 November 1938, Reinhard Heydrich sent an urgent secret telegram to the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (Security Police; SiPo) and the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), containing instructions regarding the riots. This included guidelines for the protection of foreigners and non-Jewish businesses and property. Police were instructed not to interfere with the riots unless the guidelines were violated. Police were also instructed to seize Jewish archives from synagogues and community offices, and to arrest and detain &quot;healthy male Jews, who are not too old&quot;, for eventual transfer to (labor) concentration camps. Heinrich Müller, in a message to SA and SS commanders, stated the &quot;most extreme measures&quot; were to be taken against Jewish people.

===Riots and Kristallnacht===
Beginning on November 9, the SA and Hitler Youth shattered the windows of about 7,500 Jewish stores and businesses, hence the name &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; (Crystal Night), and looted their goods. Jewish homes were ransacked all throughout Germany. Although violence against Jews had not been explicitly condoned by the authorities, there were cases of Jews being beaten or assaulted. Following the violence, police departments recorded a large number of suicides and rapes.

The rioters destroyed many hundreds of synagogues throughout Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland, with estimates of over one thousand. Over 1,400 synagogues and prayer rooms, many Jewish cemeteries, more than 7,000 Jewish shops, and 29 department stores were damaged, and in many cases destroyed. More than 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps, primarily Dachau, Buchenwald, and Sachsenhausen. 

The synagogues, some centuries old, were also victims of considerable violence and vandalism, with the tactics the Stormtroopers practiced on these and other sacred sites described as &quot;approaching the ghoulish&quot; by the United States Consul in Leipzig. Tombstones were uprooted and graves violated. Fires were lit, and prayer books, scrolls, artwork and philosophy texts were thrown upon them, and precious buildings were either burned or smashed until unrecognizable. Eric Lucas recalls the destruction of the synagogue that a tiny Jewish community had constructed in a small village only twelve years earlier:

The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; correspondent, Hugh Greene, wrote of events in Berlin:

Many Berliners were, however, deeply ashamed of the pogrom, and some took great personal risks to offer help to their beleaguered Jewish neighbors. The son of a US consular official heard the janitor of his block cry: &quot;They must have emptied the insane asylums and penitentiaries to find people who&#x27;d do things like that!&quot;

KOLD briefly reported on a 2008 remembrance meeting at a local Jewish congregation. According to eyewitness Esther Harris: &quot;They ripped up the belongings, the books, knocked over furniture, shouted obscenities&quot;. Historian Gerhard Weinberg is quoted as saying:

Houses of worship burned down, vandalized, in every community in the country where people either participate or watch.

== Aftermath ==
The former German Kaiser Wilhelm II commented &quot;For the first time, I am ashamed to be German.&quot;

Göring, who was in favor of expropriating the property of the Jews rather than destroying it as had happened in the pogrom, directly complained to &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; Chief Heydrich immediately after the events: &quot;I&#x27;d rather you had beaten to death two-hundred Jews than destroy so many valuable assets!&quot; (&quot;Mir wäre lieber gewesen, ihr hättet 200 Juden erschlagen und hättet nicht solche Werte vernichtet!&quot;). Göring met with other members of the Nazi leadership on 12 November to plan the next steps after the riot, setting the stage for formal government action. In the transcript of the meeting, Göring said,

I have received a letter written on the Führer&#x27;s orders requesting that the Jewish question be now, once and for all, coordinated and solved one way or another... I should not want to leave any doubt, gentlemen, as to the aim of today&#x27;s meeting. We have not come together merely to talk again, but to make decisions, and I implore competent agencies to take all measures for the elimination of the Jew from the German economy, and to submit them to me.

The persecution and economic damage inflicted upon German Jews continued after the pogrom, even as their places of business were ransacked. They were forced to pay &quot;Judenvermögensabgabe&quot;, a collective fine or &quot;atonement contribution&quot; of one billion Reichsmarks for the murder of vom Rath (equivalent to € billion or 7 billion in 2020 USD), which was levied by the compulsory acquisition of 20% of all Jewish property by the state. Six million Reichsmarks of insurance payments for property damage due to the Jewish community were instead paid to the Reich government as &quot;damages to the German Nation&quot;. Jews were required to pay for the cost of all damages caused by the pogrom to their residences and businesses.

The number of emigrating Jews surged, as those who were able to leave, abandoned the country. In the ten months following &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, more than 115,000 Jews emigrated from the Reich. The majority went to other European countries, the United States or Mandatory Palestine, though at least 14,000 made it to Shanghai, China. As part of government policy, the Nazis seized houses, shops, and other property the émigrés left behind. Many of the destroyed remains of Jewish property plundered during Kristallnacht were dumped near Brandenburg. In October 2008, this dumpsite was discovered by Yaron Svoray, an investigative journalist. The site, the size of four football fields, contained an extensive array of personal and ceremonial items looted during the riots against Jewish property and places of worship on the night of 9 November 1938. It is believed the goods were brought by rail to the outskirts of the village and dumped on designated land. Among the items found were glass bottles engraved with the Star of David, mezuzot, painted window sills, and the armrests of chairs found in synagogues, in addition to an ornamental swastika.

==Responses to &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;==
===In Germany===
The reaction of non-Jewish Germans to &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; was varied. Many spectators gathered on the scenes, most of them in silence. The local fire departments confined themselves to preventing the flames from spreading to neighboring buildings. In Berlin, police Lieutenant Otto Bellgardt barred SA troopers from setting the New Synagogue on fire, earning his superior officer a verbal reprimand from the commissioner.
The British historian Martin Gilbert believes that &quot;many non-Jews resented the round-up&quot;, his opinion being supported by German witness Dr. Arthur Flehinger who recalls seeing &quot;people crying while watching from behind their curtains&quot;. Rolf Dessauer recalls how a neighbor came forward and restored a portrait of Paul Ehrlich that had been &quot;slashed to ribbons&quot; by the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot;. &quot;He wanted it to be known that not all Germans supported Kristallnacht.&quot;

The extent of the damage done on Kristallnacht was so great that many Germans are said to have expressed their disapproval of it, and to have described it as senseless. There was however no personal comment or even acknowledgment from the German leader Adolf Hitler himself about &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;.

In an article released for publication on the evening of 11 November, Goebbels ascribed the events of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; to the &quot;healthy instincts&quot; of the German people. He went on to explain: &quot;The German people are anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race.&quot; Less than 24 hours after Kristallnacht, Adolf Hitler made a one-hour long speech in front of a group of journalists where he completely ignored the recent events on everyone&#x27;s mind. According to Eugene Davidson the reason for this was that Hitler wished to avoid being directly connected to an event that he was aware that many of those present condemned, regardless of Goebbels&#x27;s unconvincing explanation that Kristallnacht was caused by popular wrath. Goebbels met the foreign press in the afternoon of 11 November and said that the burning of synagogues and damage to Jewish owned property had been &quot;spontaneous manifestations of indignation against the murder of Herr Vom Rath by the young Jew Grynsban [sic]&quot;.

In 1938, just after Kristallnacht, the psychologist Michael Müller-Claudius interviewed 41 randomly selected Nazi Party members on their attitudes towards racial persecution. Of the interviewed party-members 63% expressed extreme indignation against it, while only 5% expressed approval of racial persecution, the rest being noncommittal. A study conducted in 1933 had then shown that 33% of Nazi Party members held no racial prejudice while 13% supported persecution. Sarah Ann Gordon sees two possible reasons for this difference. First, by 1938 large numbers of Germans had joined the Nazi Party for pragmatic reasons rather than ideology thus diluting the percentage of rabid antisemites; second, the Kristallnacht could have caused party members to reject antisemitism that had been acceptable to them in abstract terms but which they could not support when they saw it concretely enacted. During the events of Kristallnacht, several Gauleiter and deputy Gauleiters had refused orders to enact the Kristallnacht, and many leaders of the SA and of the Hitler Youth also openly refused party orders, while expressing disgust. Some Nazis helped Jews during the Kristallnacht.

As it was aware that the German public did not support the Kristallnacht, the propaganda ministry directed the German press to portray opponents of racial persecution as disloyal. The press was also under orders to downplay the Kristallnacht, describing general events at the local level only, with prohibition against depictions of individual events. In 1939 this was extended to a prohibition on reporting any anti-Jewish measures.

The U.S. ambassador to Germany reported:

To the consternation of the Nazis, the Kristallnacht affected public opinion counter to their desires, the peak of opposition against the Nazi racial policies was reached just then, when according to almost all accounts the vast majority of Germans rejected the violence perpetrated against the Jews. Verbal complaints grew rapidly in numbers, and for example, the Düsseldorf branch of the Gestapo reported a sharp decline in anti-Semitic attitudes among the population.

There are many indications of Protestant and Catholic disapproval of racial persecution; for example, anti-Nazi Protestants adopted the Barmen Declaration in 1934, and the Catholic church had already distributed pastoral letters critical of Nazi racial ideology, and the Nazi regime expected to encounter organised resistance from it following Kristallnacht. The Catholic leadership however, just as the various Protestant churches, refrained from responding with organised action.

Martin Sasse, Nazi Party member and bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia, leading member of the Nazi German Christians, one of the schismatic factions of German Protestantism, published a compendium of Martin Luther&#x27;s writings shortly after the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;; Sasse &quot;applauded the burning of the synagogues&quot; and the coincidence of the day, writing in the introduction, &quot;On 10 November 1938, on Luther&#x27;s birthday, the synagogues are burning in Germany.&quot; The German people, he urged, ought to heed these words &quot;of the greatest anti-Semite of his time, the warner of his people against the Jews.&quot; Diarmaid MacCulloch argued that Luther&#x27;s 1543 pamphlet, &quot;On the Jews and Their Lies&quot; was a &quot;blueprint&quot; for the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;.

===Internationally===

&quot;Kristallnacht&quot; sparked international outrage. According to Volker Ullrich, &quot;a line had been crossed: Germany had left the community of civilised nations.&quot; It discredited pro-Nazi movements in Europe and North America, leading to a sharp decline in their support. Many newspapers condemned &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, with some of them comparing it to the murderous pogroms incited by Imperial Russia. The United States recalled its ambassador (but it did not break off diplomatic relations) while other governments severed diplomatic relations with Germany in protest. The British government approved the Kindertransport program for refugee children. 

The pogrom marked a turning point in relations between Nazi Germany and the rest of the world. The brutality of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, and the Nazi government&#x27;s deliberate policy of encouraging the violence once it had begun, laid bare the repressive nature and widespread anti-Semitism entrenched in Germany. World opinion thus turned sharply against the Nazi regime, with some politicians calling for war. On 6 December 1938, William Cooper, an Aboriginal Australian, led a delegation of the Australian Aboriginal League on a march through Melbourne to the German Consulate to deliver a petition which condemned the &quot;cruel persecution of the Jewish people by the Nazi government of Germany&quot;. German officials refused to accept the tendered document.

After &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, Salvador Allende, Gabriel González Videla, Marmaduke Grove, Florencio Durán and other members of the Congress of Chile sent a telegram to Adolf Hitler denouncing the persecution of Jews.
A more personal response, in 1939, was the oratorio &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot; by the English composer Michael Tippett. Once the government of Sweden was informed of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, it successfully demanded the Nazi authorities stamp the letter J in red ink on passports of German Jews to make it easier for Swedish border officials to turn them away.

===Post-war trials===
After the end of World War II, there were hundreds of trials over Kristallnacht. The trials were conducted exclusively by German and Austrian courts; the Allied occupation authorities did not have jurisdiction since none of the victims were Allied nationals.

==&quot;Kristallnacht&quot; as a turning point==
&quot;Kristallnacht&quot; changed the nature of Nazi Germany&#x27;s persecution of the Jews from economic, political, and social exclusion to physical violence, including beatings, incarceration, and murder; the event is often referred to as the beginning of the Holocaust. In this view, it is not only described as a pogrom, it is also described as a critical stage within a process in which each step becomes the seed of the next step. An account cited that Hitler&#x27;s green light for &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; was made with the belief that it would help him realize his ambition of getting rid of the Jews in Germany. Prior to this large-scale and organized violence against the Jews, the Nazis&#x27; primary objective was to eject them from Germany, leaving their wealth behind. In the words of historian Max Rein in 1988, &quot;Kristallnacht came... and everything was changed.&quot; 

While November 1938 predated the overt articulation of &quot;the Final Solution&quot;, it foreshadowed the genocide to come. Around the time of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, the SS newspaper &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; called for a &quot;destruction by swords and flames.&quot; At a conference on the day after the pogrom, Hermann Göring said: &quot;The Jewish problem will reach its solution if, in anytime soon, we will be drawn into war beyond our border—then it is obvious that we will have to manage a final account with the Jews.&quot; 

&quot;Kristallnacht&quot; was also instrumental in changing global public opinion. In the United States, for instance, it was this specific incident that came to symbolize Nazism, forging the association between National Socialism and evil.

==Modern references==

Five decades later, 9 November&#x27;s association with the anniversary of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, as well as the earlier Beer Hall Putsch, was cited as the main reason as to why &quot;Schicksalstag&quot;, the day the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, was not turned into a new German national holiday; a different day was chosen (3 October 1990, German reunification).

The &quot;avant-garde&quot; guitarist Gary Lucas&#x27;s 1988 composition &quot;Verklärte Kristallnacht&quot;, which juxtaposes what would become the Israeli national anthem ten years after &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, &quot;Hatikvah&quot;, with phrases from the German national anthem &quot;Deutschland Über Alles&quot; amid wild electronic shrieks and noise, is intended to be a sonic representation of the horrors of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. It was premiered at the 1988 Berlin Jazz Festival and received rave reviews. (The title is a reference to Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s 1899 work &quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot; that presaged his pioneering work on atonal music; Schoenberg was an Austrian Jew who would move to the United States to escape the Nazis).

In 1989, Al Gore, then a senator from Tennessee and later Vice President of the United States, wrote of an &quot;ecological Kristallnacht&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He opined that events which were then taking place, such as deforestation and ozone depletion, prefigured a greater environmental catastrophe in the same way that Kristallnacht prefigured the Holocaust.

&quot;Kristallnacht&quot; was the inspiration for the 1993 album &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; by the composer John Zorn. The German power metal band Masterplan&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Masterplan&quot; (2003), features an anti-Nazi song entitled &quot;Crystal Night&quot; as the fourth track. The German band BAP published a song titled &quot;Kristallnaach&quot; in their Cologne dialect, dealing with the emotions engendered by the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;.

&quot;Kristallnacht&quot; was the inspiration for the 1988 composition &quot;Mayn Yngele&quot; by the composer Frederic Rzewski, of which he says: &quot;I began writing this piece in November 1988, on the 50th anniversary of the Kristallnacht... My piece is a reflection on that vanished part of Jewish tradition which so strongly colors, by its absence, the culture of our time&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published a letter from billionaire Thomas Perkins that compared the &quot;progressive war on the American one percent&quot; of wealthiest Americans and the Occupy movement&#x27;s &quot;demonization of the rich&quot; to the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; and antisemitism in Nazi Germany. The letter was widely criticized and condemned in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, among bloggers, Twitter users, and &quot;his own colleagues in Silicon Valley&quot;. Perkins subsequently apologized for making the comparisons with Nazi Germany, but otherwise stood by his letter, saying, &quot;In the Nazi era it was racial demonization, now it&#x27;s class demonization.&quot;

&quot;Kristallnacht&quot; has been referenced both explicitly and implicitly in countless cases of vandalism of Jewish property including the toppling of gravestones in a Jewish cemetery in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and the two 2017 vandalisms of the New England Holocaust Memorial, as the memorial&#x27;s founder Steve Ross discusses in his book, &quot;From Broken Glass: My Story of Finding Hope in Hitler&#x27;s Death Camps to Inspire a New Generation&quot;. The Sri Lankan Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera also used the term to describe the violence in 2019 against Muslims by Sinhalese nationalists. 

The actions of President Donald Trump have been compared with &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. On 10January 2021, the former Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger gave a speech decrying the actions of President Donald Trump and the attack he incited on the U.S. Capitol on 6 January.

On 9 November 2022, KFC app users in Germany were sent a message reading &quot;It&#x27;s memorial day for Kristallnacht! Treat yourself with more tender cheese on your crispy chicken.&quot; KFC issued an apology approximately an hour later, blaming the original message on an &quot;error in our system&quot;.

The &quot;Fortnite&quot; Holocaust Museum, a virtual museum based inside the videogame &quot;Fortnite&quot;, is set to feature a display featuring the Kristallnacht.

On 9 November 2024, the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; anniversary, the only glatt kosher restaurant in Washington, D.C. had its windows smashed.

The November 2024 Amsterdam riots in the Netherlands have been compared to the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. On 7 November 2024, Jewish and Israeli supporters of the Maccabi Tel Aviv football team were attacked by pro-Palestinian groups and local football attendees following that day&#x27;s UEFA Europa League match. The Amsterdam attacks were internationally condemned. Many Jewish advocacy groups, such as the Combat Antisemitism Movement, the Orthodox Union, and the Jewish Fedaration, have called the November 2024 Amsterdam attacks a &quot;modern-day &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;&quot;. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attacks, noting that it took place just before the 86th anniversary of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; and bore many similarities.

== Names for &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; ==
The events of November 1938 have been given disparate names by the perpetrators, bystanders, victims, and historians. In the post-war years, the terms &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; and &quot;Reichskristallnacht&quot; became established in West Germany and abroad. In East Germany, the state typically referred to the events as &quot;fascist pogrom night&quot; (). Despite speculation that the term was coined by the Nazis, there is no documented written use of the term before the end of World War II. Despite this, many people later recalled the term being used at the time, leading historians to conclude the term originated from the general public. 

Beginning in the late 1970s, alternative names for &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; were introduced as the &quot;postwar generations began challenging their parents&#x27; sanitized version of history&quot;, and by the 1980s, the &quot;harmless-sounding&quot; term &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; began to be supplanted in the German-speaking world by several alternatives, such as &quot;Reichspogromnacht&quot;, &quot;Novemberpogrome&quot;, and &quot;Novemberterror&quot;. Linguistically and historically, the term &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; is seen as problematic. It is widely seen as a euphemism that trivializes anti-Jewish violence, which avoids mentioning either the perpetrators or that the murders, looting, and arson were officially encouraged by the state. Focusing on &quot;broken glass&quot; places vandalism in the foreground and ignores the murders that were committed. Heinz Galinski, the former president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, criticized the term in 1978, stating &quot;more than just glass was broken. People were killed.&quot; The use of the word &quot;night&quot; obscures the fact that much of the violence was committed in broad daylight, and the violence was not confined to a single night. Many of the 30,000 Jews arrested following &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; were still imprisoned in concentration camps months later. The term&#x27;s unclear origins also suggest it originated from the German public and not the event&#x27;s victims. Although no evidence has been found to confirm this, &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; is still perceived by many as a Nazi coinage. 

Although &quot;Novemberpogrome&quot; is today the dominant term, some historians and authors have also criticized the use of the term &quot;pogrom&quot;, as it incorporates associations that can be interpreted as trivializing the events. The scale of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; far outstripped any pogroms in the Russian Empire, which were local or regional events of spontaneous, lawless mass-violence against Jews and their property. These massacres were initiated by a local population with at most the tacit approval of the local authorities and police. In contrast, the events of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; were centrally organized by the national government and systematically carried out across the country, a connotation which is missing from the word &quot;pogrom&quot;. The word &quot;pogrom&quot; also places the events in a context that suggests the Holocaust was not unique. Furthermore, the word &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; is established in other languages, and divergent vocabulary can add confusion and difficulty when communicating with researchers and people abroad.

On the 80th anniversary, the president of the German Historical Museum stated that there &quot;will never be&quot; an adequate name for the events of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;.

<doc id="83532" wikidata="Q3228613" url="?curid=83532" title="Lea DeLaria">
<text>Lea DeLaria (born May 23, 1958) is an American comedian, actress, and jazz singer. She portrayed Carrie &quot;Big Boo&quot; Black on the Netflix original series &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; (2013–2019). She also starred in the Broadway productions &quot;&quot; in 2022 and the 2000 revival of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. She was the first openly gay comic to appear on American television in a 1993 appearance on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;. 

==Early life==
DeLaria was born in Belleville, Illinois, the daughter of Jerry Jean (née Cox), a homemaker, and Robert George DeLaria, a jazz pianist and social worker. Her paternal grandparents were Italian. She attended kindergarten through eighth grade at St. Mary&#x27;s Elementary School in Belleville and has referenced her Catholic upbringing in her performances.

==Career==

DeLaria&#x27;s stand-up career began in 1982 when she moved to San Francisco and performed raunchy stand-up comedy in the Mission District. Discussing her stand-up, Delaria says, &quot;This is who I am, when I&#x27;m up there. This is it. I&#x27;m a big butch dyke. That&#x27;s who I am. And I&#x27;m a friendly one. I&#x27;m a big butch dyke with a smile on my face.&quot;

In 1986, DeLaria directed &quot;Ten Percent Revue&quot;, a musical revue written by Tom Wilson Weinberg that celebrates gay and lesbian culture. &quot;Ten Percent Revue&quot; was performed in Boston, San Francisco, Provincetown, Philadelphia, and Atlanta. Many shows were sold out.

From 1987 to 1989, DeLaria starred in &quot;Dos Lesbos&quot;, a musical comedy about two lesbians dealing with the issues of living together. The show received very favorable reviews nationwide.

DeLaria conceived, wrote, directed and starred in &quot;Girl Friday: We&#x27;re Funny That Way&quot;, a musical comedy, in 1989. The show won the 1989 Golden Gull for Best Comedy Group in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

When DeLaria appeared on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; in 1993, she was the first openly gay comic to appear on a late-night talk show. While appearing on the show, DeLaria said, &quot;Hello everybody, my name is Lea DeLaria, and it&#x27;s great to be here, because it&#x27;s the 1990s! It&#x27;s hip to be queer! I&#x27;m a big dyke.&quot; DeLaria later said she had been told that she should not have used the term dyke on the air. Hall later defended her, saying, &quot;If she wants to call herself a dyke, that&#x27;s her business.&quot;

In December 1993, DeLaria hosted Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Out There&quot;, the first all-gay stand-up comedy special.

DeLaria has released two CD recordings of her comedy, &quot;Bulldyke in a China Shop&quot; (1994) and &quot;Box Lunch&quot; (1997). She has also written a humorous book entitled &quot;Lea&#x27;s Book of Rules for the World&quot;.

DeLaria appeared as Jane in the 1998 Off Broadway production of Paul Rudnick&#x27;s &quot;The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told&quot;, &quot;a gay retelling of the Bible.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said &quot;a star is born with Lea DeLaria&quot; of her &quot;showstopping&quot; performance as Hildy Esterhazy in the 1998 Broadway revival of &quot;On the Town&quot;.

DeLaria subsequently played Eddie and Dr. Scott in the 2000 Broadway revival of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;, and can be heard on the cast recording. DeLaria appeared in a number of films, including &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot; and &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;.

DeLaria integrates musical performance into her stand-up comedy, focusing on traditional and modern be-bop jazz. In 2001 she released a CD of jazz standards called &quot;Play It Cool&quot;. This was followed by the album &quot;Double Standards&quot; in 2003, and by &quot;The Very Best of Lea DeLaria&quot; in 2008.

In 2001, DeLaria was the voice of Helga Phugly on the short-lived animated sitcom &quot;The Oblongs&quot;. In 1996 DeLaria played the part of a woman friend of Carol and Susan in the &quot;Friends&quot; episode The One with the Lesbian Wedding. In 1999 DeLaria played the recurring role of Madame Delphina on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, returning in 2008 as both Delphina and Professor Delbert Fina. She continued to portray Delphina on a recurring basis until 2011.

In 2008, Warner Records released &quot;The Live Smoke Sessions&quot;, DeLaria&#x27;s first recording focused on &quot;timeless pop standards&quot; such as &quot;Down With Love&quot;, &quot;Night and Day&quot;, &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; and &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine.&quot; She noted, &quot;I styled this CD on the old school live recordings ... It is my hope that this CD will take you back to 1948 and the Village Vanguard. So please let me invite you to mix a cocktail and enjoy a smoke while you sit back and soak up the swing.&quot;

In November 2008, DeLaria completed a tour of Australia, playing Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane. She also frequently collaborates with comedian Maggie Cassella, most notably on an annual Christmas cabaret show in Toronto, Ontario which also sometimes tours to several other North American cities. In July 2010, her version of &quot;All That Jazz&quot; was used on &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;. DeLaria performed in &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Since 2013, she has appeared in the Netflix Original &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; as the recurring character prison inmate Carrie &#x27;Big Boo&#x27; Black.

In December 2014, DeLaria voiced EJ Randell, the lesbian mother of Jeff in the Cartoon Network animated series &quot;Clarence&quot;.

On February 14, 2015, DeLaria received the Equality Illinois Freedom Award for her work as &quot;a cutting-edge performer who has used her talent to entertain and enlighten millions of Americans,&quot; said Bernard Cherkasov, CEO of Equality Illinois. On receiving the award at the 2015 Equality Illinois Gala in Chicago, DeLaria said, &quot;As an out performer for over 33 years who has made it her life&#x27;s work to change peoples perception of butch, queer and LGBT, it is an honor for me to receive such recognition from my home state. I feel I&#x27;m doing Belleville proud. Go Maroons!&quot;.

In 2021, DeLaria starred in Wes Hurley&#x27;s autobiographical dramedy Potato Dreams of America earning rave reviews, praise from John Waters and the Outstanding Supporting Performance Award from Tallgrass Film Festival.

In 2022, DeLaria returned to Broadway in the comic play &quot;&quot; where she received positive acclaim from critics.

== The U-Haul Joke ==
DeLaria is the originator of the U-Haul Joke (see also U-Haul lesbian) which she began performing at comedy shows in 1989.

:Question: &quot;What does a lesbian bring on a second date?&quot;
:Answer: &quot;A U-Haul.&quot;

She performs the joke on her album &quot;Box Lunch&quot; (1997).

==Personal life==
In January 2015, DeLaria became engaged to fashion editor Chelsea Fairless after two and a half years of dating. The two met through Fairless&#x27;s friend, actress Emma Myles, who plays Leanne in &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot;. In January 2017, DeLaria confirmed she and Fairless had separated.

<doc id="83537" wikidata="Q5445" url="?curid=83537" title="Anemia">
<text>Anemia (also spelled anaemia in British English) is a blood disorder in which the blood has a reduced ability to carry oxygen. This can be due to a lower than normal number of red blood cells, a reduction in the amount of hemoglobin available for oxygen transport, or abnormalities in hemoglobin that impair its function. The name is derived .

When anemia comes on slowly, the symptoms are often vague, such as tiredness, weakness, shortness of breath, headaches, and a reduced ability to exercise. When anemia is acute, symptoms may include confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, loss of consciousness, and increased thirst. Anemia must be significant before a person becomes noticeably pale. Additional symptoms may occur depending on the underlying cause. Anemia can be temporary or long term and can range from mild to severe.

Anemia can be caused by blood loss, decreased red blood cell production, and increased red blood cell breakdown. Causes of blood loss include bleeding due to inflammation of the stomach or intestines, bleeding from surgery, serious injury, or blood donation. Causes of decreased production include iron deficiency, folate deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, thalassemia and a number of bone marrow tumors. Causes of increased breakdown include genetic disorders such as sickle cell anemia, infections such as malaria, and certain autoimmune diseases like autoimmune hemolytic anemia. 

Anemia can also be classified based on the size of the red blood cells and amount of hemoglobin in each cell. If the cells are small, it is called microcytic anemia; if they are large, it is called macrocytic anemia; and if they are normal sized, it is called normocytic anemia. The diagnosis of anemia in men is based on a hemoglobin of less than 130 to 140 g/L (13 to 14 g/dL); in women, it is less than 120 to 130 g/L (12 to 13 g/dL). Further testing is then required to determine the cause.

Treatment depends on the specific cause. Certain groups of individuals, such as pregnant women, can benefit from the use of iron pills for prevention. Dietary supplementation, without determining the specific cause, is not recommended. The use of blood transfusions is typically based on a person&#x27;s signs and symptoms. In those without symptoms, they are not recommended unless hemoglobin levels are less than 60 to 80 g/L (6 to 8 g/dL). These recommendations may also apply to some people with acute bleeding. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are only recommended in those with severe anemia.

Anemia is the most common blood disorder, affecting about a fifth to a third of the global population. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia worldwide, and affects nearly one billion people. In 2013, anemia due to iron deficiency resulted in about 183,000 deaths – down from 213,000 deaths in 1990. This condition is most prevalent in children with also an above average prevalence in elderly and women of reproductive age (especially during pregnancy). Anemia is one of the six WHO global nutrition targets for 2025 and for diet-related global targets endorsed by World Health Assembly in 2012 and 2013. Efforts to reach global targets contribute to reaching Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with anemia as one of the targets in SDG 2 for achieving zero world hunger.

==Signs and symptoms==
A person with anemia may not have any symptoms, depending on the underlying cause, and no symptoms may be noticed, as the anemia is initially mild, and then the symptoms become worse as the anemia worsens. A patient with anemia may report feeling tired, weak, decreased ability to concentrate, and sometimes shortness of breath on exertion. These symptoms are unspecific and none of the symptoms alone or in combination show a good predictive value for the presence of anemia in non-clinical patients.
Symptoms of anemia can come on quickly or slowly. Early on there may be few or no symptoms. If the anemia continues slowly (chronic), the body may adapt and compensate for this change. In this case, no symptoms may appear until the anemia becomes more severe. Symptoms can include feeling tired, weak, dizziness, headaches, intolerance to physical exertion, shortness of breath, difficulty concentrating, irregular or rapid heartbeat, cold hands and feet, cold intolerance, pale or yellow skin, poor appetite, easy bruising and bleeding, and muscle weakness. 

Anemia that develops quickly, often, has more severe symptoms, including, feeling faint, chest pain, sweating, increased thirst, and confusion. There may be also additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause.

In more severe anemia, the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing cardiac output. The person may have symptoms related to this, such as palpitations, angina (if pre-existing heart disease is present), intermittent claudication of the legs, and symptoms of heart failure.

On examination, the signs exhibited may include pallor (pale skin, mucosa, conjunctiva and nail beds), but this is not a reliable sign. 

Iron-deficiency anemia may give symptoms that can include spoon-shaped nails, restless legs syndrome, and pica (the medical condition indicates the desire for things that are not food, such as ice, dirt, etc.). A blue coloration of the sclera may be noticed in some cases of iron-deficiency anemia. Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia may result in decreased ability to think, memory loss, confusion, personality or mood changes, depression, difficulty walking, blurred vision, and irreversible nerve damage. Other specific causes of anemia may have signs and/or complications such as, jaundice with the rapid break down of red blood cells as with hemolytic anemia, bone abnormalities with thalassemia major, or leg ulcers as seen in sickle cell disease.

In severe anemia, there may be signs of a hyperdynamic circulation: tachycardia (a fast heart rate), bounding pulse, flow murmurs, and cardiac ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement). There may be signs of heart failure.
Pica, the consumption of non-food items such as ice, paper, wax, grass, hair or dirt, may be a symptom of iron deficiency; although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of hemoglobin. Chronic anemia may result in behavioral disturbances in children as a direct result of impaired neurological development in infants, and reduced academic performance in children of school age. Restless legs syndrome is more common in people with iron-deficiency anemia than in the general population.

==Causes==

The causes of anemia may be classified as impaired red blood cell (RBC) production, increased RBC destruction (hemolytic anemia), blood loss and fluid overload (hypervolemia). Several of these may interplay to cause anemia. The most common cause of anemia is blood loss, but this usually does not cause any lasting symptoms unless a relatively impaired RBC production develops, in turn, most commonly by iron deficiency.

===Impaired production===
* Disturbance of proliferation and differentiation of stem cells
** Pure red cell aplasia
** Aplastic anemia affects all kinds of blood cells. Fanconi anemia is a hereditary disorder or defect featuring aplastic anemia and various other abnormalities.
** Anemia of kidney failure due to insufficient production of the hormone erythropoietin
** Anemia of endocrine disease
* Disturbance of proliferation and maturation of erythroblasts
** Pernicious anemia is a form of megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency dependent on impaired absorption of vitamin B12. Lack of dietary B12 causes non-pernicious megaloblastic anemia.
** Anemia of folate deficiency, as with vitamin B12, causes megaloblastic anemia
** Anemia of prematurity, by diminished erythropoietin response to declining hematocrit levels, combined with blood loss from laboratory testing, generally occurs in premature infants at two to six weeks of age.
** Iron-deficiency anemia, resulting in deficient heme synthesis
** Thalassemias, causing deficient globin synthesis
** Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, causing ineffective erythropoiesis
** Anemia of kidney failure (also causing stem cell dysfunction)
* Other mechanisms of impaired RBC production
** Myelophthisic anemia or myelophthisis is a severe type of anemia resulting from the replacement of bone marrow by other materials, such as malignant tumors, fibrosis, or granulomas.
** Myelodysplastic syndrome
** anemia of chronic inflammation
** Leukoerythroblastic anemia is caused by space-occupying lesions in the bone marrow that prevent normal production of blood cells.

===Increased destruction===

Anemias of increased red blood cell destruction are generally classified as hemolytic anemias. These types generally feature jaundice, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase.
* Intrinsic (intracorpuscular) abnormalities cause premature destruction. All of these, except paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, are hereditary genetic disorders.
** Hereditary spherocytosis is a hereditary defect that results in defects in the RBC cell membrane, causing the erythrocytes to be sequestered and destroyed by the spleen.
** Hereditary elliptocytosis is another defect in membrane skeleton proteins.
** Abetalipoproteinemia, causing defects in membrane lipids
** Enzyme deficiencies
*** Pyruvate kinase and hexokinase deficiencies, causing defect glycolysis
*** Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and glutathione synthetase deficiency, causing increased oxidative stress
** Hemoglobinopathies
*** Sickle cell anemia
*** Hemoglobinopathies causing unstable hemoglobins
** Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
* Extrinsic (extracorpuscular) abnormalities
** Antibody-mediated
*** Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia is caused by autoimmune attack against red blood cells, primarily by IgG. It is the most common of the autoimmune hemolytic diseases. It can be idiopathic, that is, without any known cause, drug-associated or secondary to another disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, or a malignancy, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
*** Cold agglutinin hemolytic anemia is primarily mediated by IgM. It can be idiopathic or result from an underlying condition.
*** Rh disease, one of the causes of hemolytic disease of the newborn
*** Transfusion reaction to blood transfusions
** Mechanical trauma to red blood cells
*** Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and disseminated intravascular coagulation
*** Infections, including malaria
*** Heart surgery
*** Haemodialysis
** Parasitic
*** &quot;Trypanosoma congolense&quot; alters the surfaces of RBCs of its host and this may explain &quot;T. c.&quot; induced anemia

===Blood loss===
* Anemia of prematurity, from frequent blood sampling for laboratory testing, combined with insufficient RBC production
* Trauma or surgery, causing acute blood loss
* Gastrointestinal tract lesions, causing either acute bleeds (e.g. variceal lesions, peptic ulcers, hemorrhoids) or chronic blood loss (e.g. angiodysplasia)
* Gynecologic disturbances, also generally causing chronic blood loss
* From menstruation, mostly among young women or older women who have fibroids
* Many type of cancers, including colorectal cancer and cancer of the urinary bladder, may cause acute or chronic blood loss, especially at advanced stages
* Infection by intestinal nematodes feeding on blood, such as hookworms and the whipworm &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot; 
* Iatrogenic anemia, blood loss from repeated blood draws and medical procedures.

The roots of the words &quot;anemia&quot; and &quot;ischemia&quot; both refer to the basic idea of &quot;lack of blood&quot;, but anemia and ischemia are not the same thing in modern medical terminology. The word &quot;anemia&quot; used alone implies widespread &quot;effects&quot; from blood that either is too scarce (e.g., blood loss) or is dysfunctional in its oxygen-supplying ability (due to whatever type of hemoglobin or erythrocyte problem). In contrast, the word &quot;ischemia&quot; refers solely to the lack of blood (poor perfusion). Thus ischemia in a body part can cause localized anemic effects within those tissues.

===Fluid overload===
Fluid overload (hypervolemia) causes decreased hemoglobin concentration and apparent anemia:
* General causes of hypervolemia include excessive sodium or fluid intake, sodium or water retention and fluid shift into the intravascular space.
* From the sixth week of pregnancy, hormonal changes cause an increase in the mother&#x27;s blood volume due to an increase in plasma.

===Intestinal inflammation===
Certain gastrointestinal disorders can cause anemia. The mechanisms involved are multifactorial and not limited to malabsorption but mainly related to chronic intestinal inflammation, which causes dysregulation of hepcidin that leads to decreased access of iron to the circulation.
* &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection.
* Gluten-related disorders: untreated celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Anemia can be the only manifestation of celiac disease, in absence of gastrointestinal or any other symptoms.
* Inflammatory bowel disease.

==Diagnosis==

===Definitions===
There are a number of definitions of anemia; reviews provide comparison and contrast of them. A strict but broad definition is an absolute decrease in red blood cell mass, however, a broader definition is a lowered ability of the blood to carry oxygen. An operational definition is a decrease in whole-blood hemoglobin concentration of more than 2 standard deviations below the mean of an age- and sex-matched reference range.

It is difficult to directly measure RBC mass, so the hematocrit (amount of RBCs) or the hemoglobin (Hb) in the blood are often used instead to indirectly estimate the value. Hematocrit; however, is concentration dependent and is therefore not completely accurate. For example, during pregnancy a woman&#x27;s RBC mass is normal but because of an increase in blood volume the hemoglobin and hematocrit are diluted and thus decreased. Another example would be bleeding where the RBC mass would decrease but the concentrations of hemoglobin and hematocrit initially remains normal until fluids shift from other areas of the body to the intravascular space.

The anemia is also classified by severity into mild (110 g/L to normal), moderate (80 g/L to 110 g/L), and severe anemia (less than 80 g/L) in adults. Different values are used in pregnancy and children.

===Testing===
Anemia is typically diagnosed on a complete blood count. Apart from reporting the number of red blood cells and the hemoglobin level, the automatic counters also measure the size of the red blood cells by flow cytometry, which is an important tool in distinguishing between the causes of anemia. Examination of a stained blood smear using a microscope can also be helpful, and it is sometimes a necessity in regions of the world where automated analysis is less accessible.

A blood test will provide counts of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. If anemia appears, further tests may determine what type it is, and whether it has a serious cause. although of that, it is possible to refer to the genetic history and physical diagnosis. These tests may also include serum ferritin, iron studies, vitamin B12, genetic testing, and a bone marrow sample, if needed.

Reticulocyte counts, and the &quot;kinetic&quot; approach to anemia, have become more common than in the past in the large medical centers of the United States and some other wealthy nations, in part because some automatic counters now have the capacity to include reticulocyte counts. A reticulocyte count is a quantitative measure of the bone marrow&#x27;s production of new red blood cells. The reticulocyte production index is a calculation of the ratio between the level of anemia and the extent to which the reticulocyte count has risen in response. If the degree of anemia is significant, even a &quot;normal&quot; reticulocyte count actually may reflect an inadequate response.

If an automated count is not available, a reticulocyte count can be done manually following special staining of the blood film. In manual examination, activity of the bone marrow can also be gauged qualitatively by subtle changes in the numbers and the morphology of young RBCs by examination under a microscope. Newly formed RBCs are usually slightly larger than older RBCs and show polychromasia. Even where the source of blood loss is obvious, evaluation of erythropoiesis can help assess whether the bone marrow will be able to compensate for the loss and at what rate.

When the cause is not obvious, clinicians use other tests, such as: ESR, serum iron, transferrin, RBC folate level, hemoglobin electrophoresis, renal function tests (e.g. serum creatinine) although the tests will depend on the clinical hypothesis that is being investigated.

When the diagnosis remains difficult, a bone marrow examination allows direct examination of the precursors to red cells, although is rarely used as is painful, invasive and is hence reserved for cases where severe pathology needs to be determined or excluded.

===Red blood cell size===
In the morphological approach, anemia is classified by the size of red blood cells; this is either done automatically or on microscopic examination of a peripheral blood smear. The size is reflected in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). If the cells are smaller than normal (under 80 fl), the anemia is said to be microcytic; if they are normal size (80–100 fl), normocytic; and if they are larger than normal (over 100 fl), the anemia is classified as macrocytic. This scheme quickly exposes some of the most common causes of anemia; for instance, a microcytic anemia is often the result of iron deficiency. 

In clinical workup, the MCV will be one of the first pieces of information available, so even among clinicians who consider the &quot;kinetic&quot; approach more useful philosophically, morphology will remain an important element of classification and diagnosis.
Limitations of MCV include cases where the underlying cause is due to a combination of factors – such as iron deficiency (a cause of microcytosis) and vitamin B12 deficiency (a cause of macrocytosis) where the net result can be normocytic cells.

===Production vs. destruction or loss===
The &quot;kinetic&quot; approach to anemia yields arguably the most clinically relevant classification of anemia. This classification depends on evaluation of several hematological parameters, particularly the blood reticulocyte (precursor of mature RBCs) count. This then yields the classification of defects by decreased RBC production versus increased RBC destruction or loss. Clinical signs of loss or destruction include abnormal peripheral blood smear with signs of hemolysis; elevated LDH suggesting cell destruction; or clinical signs of bleeding, such as guaiac-positive stool, radiographic findings, or frank bleeding.
The following is a simplified schematic of this approach:



&quot;*&quot; &quot;For instance, sickle cell anemia with superimposed iron deficiency; chronic gastric bleeding with B12 and folate deficiency; and other instances of anemia with more than one cause.&quot;
&quot;**&quot; &quot;Confirm by repeating reticulocyte count: ongoing combination of low reticulocyte production index, normal MCV and hemolysis or loss may be seen in bone marrow failure or anemia of chronic disease, with superimposed or related hemolysis or blood loss.&quot;
Here is a schematic representation of how to consider anemia with MCV as the starting point:


Other characteristics visible on the peripheral smear may provide valuable clues about a more specific diagnosis; for example, abnormal white blood cells may point to a cause in the bone marrow.

====Microcytic====

Microcytic anemia is primarily a result of hemoglobin synthesis failure/insufficiency, which could be caused by several etiologies:

Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia overall and it has many causes. RBCs often appear hypochromic (paler than usual) and microcytic (smaller than usual) when viewed with a microscope.
* Iron-deficiency anemia is due to insufficient dietary intake or absorption of iron to meet the body&#x27;s needs. Infants, toddlers, and pregnant women have higher than average needs. Increased iron intake is also needed to offset blood losses due to digestive tract issues, frequent blood donations, or heavy menstrual periods. Iron is an essential part of hemoglobin, and low iron levels result in decreased incorporation of hemoglobin into red blood cells. In the United States, 12% of all women of childbearing age have iron deficiency, compared with only 2% of adult men. The incidence is as high as 20% among African American and Mexican American women. In India it is even more than 50%. Studies have linked iron deficiency without anemia to poor school performance and lower IQ in teenage girls, although this may be due to socioeconomic factors. Iron deficiency is the most prevalent deficiency state on a worldwide basis. It is sometimes the cause of abnormal fissuring of the angular (corner) sections of the lips (angular stomatitis).
* In the United States, the most common cause of iron deficiency is bleeding or blood loss, usually from the gastrointestinal tract. Fecal occult blood testing, upper endoscopy and lower endoscopy should be performed to identify bleeding lesions. In older men and women, the chances are higher that bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract could be due to colon polyps or colorectal cancer.
* Worldwide, the most common cause of iron-deficiency anemia is parasitic infestation (hookworms, amebiasis, schistosomiasis and whipworms).
The Mentzer index (mean cell volume divided by the RBC count) predicts whether microcytic anemia may be due to iron deficiency or thalassemia, although it requires confirmation.

====Macrocytic====

* Megaloblastic anemia, the most common cause of macrocytic anemia, is due to a deficiency of either vitamin B12, folic acid, or both. Deficiency in folate or vitamin B12 can be due either to inadequate intake or insufficient absorption. Folate deficiency normally does not produce neurological symptoms, while B12 deficiency does.
** Pernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor, which is required to absorb vitamin B12 from food. A lack of intrinsic factor may arise from an autoimmune condition targeting the parietal cells (atrophic gastritis) that produce intrinsic factor or against intrinsic factor itself. These lead to poor absorption of vitamin B12.
** Macrocytic anemia can also be caused by the removal of the functional portion of the stomach, such as during gastric bypass surgery, leading to reduced vitamin B12/folate absorption. Therefore, one must always be aware of anemia following this procedure.
* Hypothyroidism
* Alcoholism commonly causes a macrocytosis, although not specifically anemia. Other types of liver disease can also cause macrocytosis.
* Drugs such as methotrexate, zidovudine, and other substances may inhibit DNA replication such as heavy metals
Macrocytic anemia can be further divided into &quot;megaloblastic anemia&quot; or &quot;nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia&quot;. The cause of megaloblastic anemia is primarily a failure of DNA synthesis with preserved RNA synthesis, which results in restricted cell division of the progenitor cells. The megaloblastic anemias often present with neutrophil hypersegmentation (six to 10 lobes). The nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias have different etiologies (i.e. unimpaired DNA globin synthesis,) which occur, for example, in alcoholism.
In addition to the nonspecific symptoms of anemia, specific features of vitamin B12 deficiency include peripheral neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the cord with resulting balance difficulties from posterior column spinal cord pathology. Other features may include a smooth, red tongue and glossitis.
The treatment for vitamin B12-deficient anemia was first devised by William Murphy, who bled dogs to make them anemic, and then fed them various substances to see what (if anything) would make them healthy again. He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to cure the disease. George Minot and George Whipple then set about to isolate the curative substance chemically and ultimately were able to isolate the vitamin B12 from the liver. All three shared the 1934 Nobel Prize in Medicine.

====Normocytic====

Normocytic anemia occurs when the overall hemoglobin levels are decreased, but the red blood cell size (mean corpuscular volume) remains normal. Causes include:
====Dimorphic====
A dimorphic appearance on a peripheral blood smear occurs when there are two simultaneous populations of red blood cells, typically of different size and hemoglobin content (this last feature affecting the color of the red blood cell on a stained peripheral blood smear). For example, a person recently transfused for iron deficiency would have small, pale, iron deficient red blood cells (RBCs) and the donor RBCs of normal size and color. Similarly, a person transfused for severe folate or vitamin B12 deficiency would have two cell populations, but, in this case, the patient&#x27;s RBCs would be larger and paler than the donor&#x27;s RBCs. 

A person with sideroblastic anemia (a defect in heme synthesis, commonly caused by alcoholism, but also drugs/toxins, nutritional deficiencies, a few acquired and rare congenital diseases) can have a dimorphic smear from the sideroblastic anemia alone. Evidence for multiple causes appears with an elevated RBC distribution width (RDW), indicating a wider-than-normal range of red cell sizes, also seen in common nutritional anemia.

====Heinz body anemia====
Heinz bodies form in the cytoplasm of RBCs and appear as small dark dots under the microscope. In animals, Heinz body anemia has many causes. It may be drug-induced, for example in cats and dogs by acetaminophen (paracetamol), or may be caused by eating various plants or other substances:
* In cats and dogs after eating either raw or cooked plants from the genus &quot;Allium&quot;, for example, onions or garlic.
* In dogs after ingestion of zinc, for example, after eating U.S. pennies minted after 1982.
* In horses which eat dry or wilted red maple leaves.

===Hyperanemia===
Hyperanemia is a severe form of anemia, in which the hematocrit is below 10%.

===Refractory anemia===
Refractory anemia, an anemia which does not respond to treatment, is often seen secondary to myelodysplastic syndromes. Iron-deficiency anemia may also be refractory as a manifestation of gastrointestinal problems which disrupt iron absorption or cause occult bleeding.
===Transfusion dependent===
Transfusion dependent anemia is a form of anemia where ongoing blood transfusion are required. Most people with myelodysplastic syndrome develop this state at some point in time. Beta thalassemia may also result in transfusion dependence. Concerns from repeated blood transfusions include iron overload. This iron overload may require chelation therapy.

==Treatment==
The global market for anemia treatments is estimated at more than USD 23 billion per year and is fast growing because of the rising prevalence and awareness of anemia. The types of anemia treated with drugs are iron-deficiency anemia, thalassemia, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia, and pernicious anemia, the most important of them being deficiency and sickle cell anemia with together 60% of market share because of highest prevalence as well as higher treatment costs compared with other types. Treatment for anemia depends on cause and severity. Vitamin supplements given orally (folic acid or vitamin B12) or intramuscularly (vitamin B12) will replace specific deficiencies. 

Apart from that, iron supplements, antibiotics, immunosuppressant, bone marrow stimulants, corticosteroids, gene therapy and iron chelating agents are forms of anemia treatment drugs, with immunosuppressants and corticosteroids accounting for 58% of the market share. A paradigm shift towards gene therapy and monoclonal antibody therapies is observed. 

===Oral iron===

Nutritional iron deficiency is common in developing nations. An estimated two-thirds of children and of women of childbearing age in most developing nations are estimated to have iron deficiency without anemia with one-third of them having an iron deficiency with anemia. Iron deficiency due to inadequate dietary iron intake is rare in men and postmenopausal women. The diagnosis of iron deficiency mandates a search for potential sources of blood loss, such as gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers or colon cancer.

Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia is treated by oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, or ferrous gluconate. Daily iron supplements have been shown to be effective in reducing anemia in women of childbearing age. When taking iron supplements, stomach upset or darkening of the feces are commonly experienced. The stomach upset can be alleviated by taking the iron with food; however, this decreases the amount of iron absorbed. Vitamin C aids in the body&#x27;s ability to absorb iron, so taking oral iron supplements with orange juice is of benefit.

In the anemia of chronic kidney disease, recombinant erythropoietin or epoetin alfa is recommended to stimulate RBC production, and if iron deficiency and inflammation are also present, concurrent parenteral iron is also recommended.

===Injectable iron===
In cases where oral iron has either proven ineffective, would be too slow (for example, pre-operatively), or where absorption is impeded (for example in cases of inflammation), parenteral iron preparations can be used. Parenteral iron can improve iron stores rapidly and is also effective for treating people with postpartum haemorrhage, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic heart failure. The body can absorb up to 6 mg iron daily from the gastrointestinal tract. In many cases, the patient has a deficit of over 1,000 mg of iron which would require several months to replace. This can be given concurrently with erythropoietin to ensure sufficient iron for increased rates of erythropoiesis.

===Blood transfusions===
Blood transfusions in those without symptoms is not recommended until the hemoglobin is below 60 to 80 g/L (6 to 8 g/dL). In those with coronary artery disease who are not actively bleeding transfusions are only recommended when the hemoglobin is below 70 to 80g/L (7 to 8 g/dL). Transfusing earlier does not improve survival. Transfusions otherwise should only be undertaken in cases of cardiovascular instability.

A 2012 review concluded that when considering blood transfusions for anaemia in people with advanced cancer who have fatigue and breathlessness (not related to cancer treatment or haemorrhage), consideration should be given to whether there are alternative strategies can be tried before a blood transfusion.

=== Vitamin B12 intramuscular injections ===
In many cases, vitamin B12 is used by intramuscular injection in severe cases or cases of malabsorption of dietary-B12. Pernicious anemia caused by loss of intrinsic factor cannot be prevented. If there are other, reversible causes of low vitamin B12 levels, the cause must be treated.

Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is usually easily treated by providing the necessary level of vitamin B12 supplementation. The injections are quick-acting, and symptoms usually go away within one to two weeks. As the condition improves, doses are reduced to weeks and then can be given monthly. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms. Treatment should begin rapidly for severe neurological symptoms, as some changes can become permanent. In some individuals lifelong treatment may be needed.

===Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents===
The objective for the administration of an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) is to maintain hemoglobin at the lowest level that both minimizes transfusions and meets the individual person&#x27;s needs. They should not be used for mild or moderate anemia. They are not recommended in people with chronic kidney disease unless hemoglobin levels are less than 10 g/dL or they have symptoms of anemia. Their use should be along with parenteral iron. The 2020 Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group review of erythropoietin (EPO) plus iron versus control treatment including placebo or iron for preoperative anaemic adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery demonstrated that patients were much less likely to require red cell transfusion and in those transfused, the volumes were unchanged (mean difference -0.09, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.05). Pre-operative hemoglobin concentration was increased in those receiving &#x27;high dose&#x27; EPO, but not &#x27;low dose&#x27;.

===Hyperbaric oxygen===
Treatment of exceptional blood loss (anemia) is recognized as an indication for hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society. The use of HBO is indicated when oxygen delivery to tissue is not sufficient in patients who cannot be given blood transfusions for medical or religious reasons. HBO may be used for medical reasons when threat of blood product incompatibility or concern for transmissible disease are factors. The beliefs of some religions (ex: Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses) may require they use the HBO method. A 2005 review of the use of HBO in severe anemia found all publications reported positive results.

=== Preoperative anemia ===
An estimated 30% of adults who require non-cardiac surgery have anemia. In order to determine an appropriate preoperative treatment, it is suggested that the cause of anemia be first determined. There is moderate level medical evidence that supports a combination of iron supplementation and erythropoietin treatment to help reduce the requirement for red blood cell transfusions after surgery in those who have preoperative anemia.

==Epidemiology==
Anemia affects 27% of the world&#x27;s population with iron-deficiency anemia accounting for more than 60% of it. A moderate degree of iron-deficiency anemia affected approximately 610 million people worldwide or 8.8% of the population. It is somewhat more common in females (9.9%) than males (7.8%). Mild iron-deficiency anemia affects another 375 million. Severe anaemia is prevalent globally, and especially in sub-Saharan Africa where it is associated with infections including malaria and invasive bacterial infections.

==History==

Signs of severe anemia in human bones from 4000 years ago have been uncovered in Thailand.

<text>Leslie Howard Steiner (3 April 18931 June 1943) was an English actor, director, producer and writer. He wrote many stories and articles for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and was one of the biggest box-office draws and movie idols of the 1930s.

Active in both Britain and Hollywood, Howard played Ashley Wilkes in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). He had roles in many other films, including &quot;Berkeley Square&quot; (1933), &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (both 1934), &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; (1936), &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1938), &quot;Intermezzo&quot; (1939), &quot;&quot;Pimpernel&quot; Smith&quot; (1941), and &quot;The First of the Few&quot; (1942). He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for &quot;Berkeley Square&quot; and &quot;Pygmalion&quot;.

Howard&#x27;s Second World War activities included acting and filmmaking. He helped to make anti-German propaganda and shore up support for the Allies; two years after his death, the &quot;British Film Yearbook&quot; described Howard&#x27;s work as &quot;one of the most valuable facets of British propaganda&quot;. He was rumoured to have been involved with British or Allied Intelligence, sparking conspiracy theories regarding his death in 1943 when the Luftwaffe shot down BOAC Flight 777 over the Atlantic (off the coast of Cedeira, A Coruña), on which he was a passenger.

==Early life==

Howard was born Leslie Howard Steiner to a British mother, Lilian (&quot;née&quot; Blumberg), and a Hungarian Jewish father, Ferdinand Steiner, in Forest Hill, London. His younger brother was actor Arthur Howard. Lilian had been raised as a Christian, but she was of partial Jewish ancestry—her paternal grandfather Ludwig Blumberg, a Jewish merchant who had married into the English upper-middle classes.

He received his formal education at Alleyn&#x27;s School, London. Like many others around the time of the First World War, the family anglicised its name, in this case to &quot;Stainer&quot;, although Howard&#x27;s name remained Steiner in official documents, such as his military records.

Howard was a 21-year-old bank clerk in Dulwich when the First World War began; in September 1914 he voluntarily enlisted (under the name Leslie Howard Steiner) as a Private with the British Army&#x27;s Inns of Court Officer Training Corps in London. In February 1915 he received a commission as a subaltern with the 3/1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, with which he trained in England until 19 May 1916, when he resigned his commission and was medically discharged from the British Army with neurasthenia.

In March 1920, Howard gave public notice in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; that he had changed his surname, and would thereafter be known by the name of Howard instead of Steiner.

==Theatre career==

Howard began his professional acting career in regional tours of &quot;Peg O&#x27; My Heart&quot; and &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; in 1916–17 and on the London stage in 1917, but had his greatest theatrical success in the United States in Broadway theatre, in plays such as &quot;Aren&#x27;t We All?&quot; (1923), &quot;Outward Bound&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Green Hat&quot; (1925). He became an undisputed Broadway star in &quot;Her Cardboard Lover&quot; (1927). After his success as time traveller Peter Standish in &quot;Berkeley Square&quot; (1929), Howard launched his Hollywood career in the film version of &quot;Outward Bound&quot;, but didn&#x27;t like the experience and vowed never to return to Hollywood. However, he did return, many times—later repeating the Standish role in the 1933 film version of &quot;Berkeley Square&quot;.

The stage, however, continued to be an important part of his career. Howard frequently juggled acting, producing and directing duties in the Broadway productions in which he starred. Howard was also a dramatist, and starred in the Broadway production of his own play &quot;Murray Hill&quot; (1927). He played Matt Denant in John Galsworthy&#x27;s 1927 Broadway production &quot;Escape&quot; in which he first made his mark as a dramatic actor. His stage triumphs continued with &quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; (1934). He later repeated both roles in the film versions.

Howard loved to play Shakespeare, but according to producer John Houseman he could be lazy about learning lines. He first sprang to fame playing in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936) in the role of the leading man. During the same period he had the misfortune to open on Broadway in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1936) just a few weeks after John Gielgud launched a rival production of the same play that was far more successful with both critics and audiences. Howard&#x27;s production, his final stage role, lasted for only 39 performances before closing.

Howard was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981.

==Film career==

In 1920 Howard suggested to his friend Adrian Brunel that they form a film production company. After Howard&#x27;s initial suggestion of calling it British Comedy Films Ltd., the two eventually settled on the name Minerva Films Ltd. The company&#x27;s board of directors consisted of Howard, Brunel, C. Aubrey Smith, Nigel Playfair and A. A. Milne. One of the company&#x27;s investors was H. G. Wells. Although the films produced by Minerva—which were written by A. A. Milne—were well received by critics, the company was only offered £200 apiece for films that cost it £1,000 to produce, and Minerva Films was short-lived. Early films include four written by A. A. Milne, including &quot;The Bump&quot;, starring C. Aubrey Smith; &quot;Twice Two&quot;; &quot;Five Pounds Reward&quot;; and &quot;Bookworms&quot;, the latter two starring Howard. Some of these films survive in the archives of the British Film Institute.

In British and Hollywood productions, Howard often played stiff upper lipped Englishmen. He appeared in the film version of &quot;Outward Bound&quot; (1930), though in a different role from the one he portrayed on Broadway. He had second billing under Norma Shearer in &quot;A Free Soul&quot; (1931), which also featured Lionel Barrymore and future &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; rival Clark Gable eight years prior to their Civil War masterpiece. He starred in the film version of &quot;Berkeley Square&quot; (1933), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. He played the title role in &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1934), which is often considered the definitive portrayal.
When Howard co-starred with Bette Davis in &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; (1936) – having earlier co-starred with her in the film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s book &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1934) – he reportedly insisted that Humphrey Bogart play gangster Duke Mantee, repeating his role from the stage production. This re-launched Bogart&#x27;s screen career, and the two men became lifelong friends; Bogart and Lauren Bacall later named their daughter &quot;Leslie Howard Bogart&quot; after him. In the same year Howard starred with Norma Shearer in a film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936).

Bette Davis was again Howard&#x27;s co-star in the romantic comedy &quot;It&#x27;s Love I&#x27;m After&quot; (1937) (also co-starring Olivia de Havilland). He played Professor Henry Higgins in the film version of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1938), with Wendy Hiller as Eliza, which earned Howard another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. In 1939, as war approached, he played opposite Ingrid Bergman in &quot;Intermezzo&quot;; that August, Howard was determined to return to the country of his birth. He was eager to help the war effort, but lost any support for a new film, instead being obliged to relinquish £20,000 of holdings in the US before he could leave the country.

Howard is perhaps best remembered for his role as Ashley Wilkes in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), his last American film, but he was uncomfortable with Hollywood, and returned to Britain to help with the Second World War effort. He starred in a number of Second World War films, including &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941), &quot;&quot;Pimpernel&quot; Smith&quot; (1941) and &quot;The First of the Few&quot; (1942, known in the U.S. as &quot;Spitfire&quot;), the latter two of which he also directed and co-produced. His friend and &quot;The First of the Few&quot; co-star David Niven said Howard was &quot;...not what he seemed. He had the kind of distraught air that would make people want to mother him. Actually, he was about as naïve as General Motors. Busy little brain, always going.&quot;

In 1944, after his death, British exhibitors voted him the second-most popular local star at the box office. His daughter said he was a &quot;remarkable man&quot;.

==Personal life==
Howard married Ruth Evelyn Martin (1895–1980) on 3 March 1916. Their children were Ronald &quot;Winkie&quot; (1918–1996) and Leslie Ruth &quot;Doodie&quot; (1924–2013) who appeared with her father and David Niven in the film &quot;The First of the Few&quot; (1942), playing the role of nurse to David Niven&#x27;s character, and was a major contributor in the filmed biography of her father, &quot;Leslie Howard: The Man Who Gave a Damn&quot;. His son, Ronald Howard, became an actor and played the title role in the television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1954). His younger brother Arthur was also an actor, primarily in British comedies. His sister Irene was a costume designer and a casting director for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. His sister Doris Stainer founded the Hurst Lodge School in Sunningdale, Berkshire, in 1945 and remained its headmistress until the 1970s.

Howard was widely known as a &quot;ladies&#x27; man&quot;, and he once said that he &quot;didn&#x27;t chase women but ... couldn&#x27;t always be bothered to run away&quot;. He reportedly had affairs with Tallulah Bankhead when they appeared on stage in the UK in &quot;Her Cardboard Lover&quot; (1927), with Merle Oberon while filming &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1934) and with Conchita Montenegro, with whom he had appeared in the film &quot;Never the Twain Shall Meet&quot; (1931). There were also rumours of affairs with Norma Shearer and Myrna Loy during filming of &quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot;. Howard reportedly fathered a daughter - Carol Grace, born 1924 - by Rosheen Marcus; Carol married writer William Saroyan and then actor Walter Matthau.

Howard fell in love with Violette Cunnington in 1938 while working on &quot;Pygmalion&quot;. She was secretary to Gabriel Pascal who was producing the film; she became Howard&#x27;s secretary and lover and they travelled to the United States and lived together while he was filming &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and &quot;Intermezzo&quot; (both 1939). His wife and daughter joined him in Hollywood before production ended on the two films, making his arrangement with Cunnington somewhat uncomfortable for everyone. He left the United States for the last time with his wife and daughter in August, 1939 and Cunnington soon followed. She appeared in &quot;&quot;Pimpernel&quot; Smith&quot; (1941) and &quot;The First of the Few&quot; (1942) in minor roles under the stage name of Suzanne Clair. She died of pneumonia in her early thirties in 1942, just six months before Howard&#x27;s death. Howard left her his Beverly Hills house in his will.

The Howard family&#x27;s home in Britain was Stowe Maries, a 16th-century, six-bedroom farmhouse on the edge of Westcott, Surrey. His will revealed an estate of £62,761, the equivalent of £ as of . An English Heritage blue plaque was placed at 45 Farquhar Road, Upper Norwood, London in 2013.

==Death==


In May 1943, Howard travelled to Portugal to promote the British cause. He stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Hotel Atlântico, between 1 May and 4 May, then again between 8 May and 10 May and again between 25 May and 31 May 1943. The following day, 1 June 1943, he was aboard KLM Royal Dutch Airlines/BOAC Flight 777, &quot;G-AGBB&quot; a Douglas DC-3 flying from Lisbon to Bristol, when it was shot down by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Junkers Ju 88 C-6 maritime fighter aircraft over the Atlantic (off Cedeira, A Coruña). He was among the 17 fatalities, including four KLM flight crew.

The BOAC DC-3 &quot;Ibis&quot; had been operating on a scheduled Lisbon–Whitchurch route throughout 1942–43 that did not pass over what would commonly be referred to as a war zone. By 1942, however, the Germans considered the region an &quot;extremely sensitive war zone&quot;. On two occasions, 15 November 1942 and 19 April 1943, the camouflaged airliner had been attacked by Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters (a single aircraft and six Bf 110s, respectively) while &quot;en route&quot;; each time, the pilots escaped by evasive tactics.

On 1 June 1943, &quot;G-AGBB&quot; again came under attack by a swarm of eight V/KG40 Ju 88 C-6 maritime fighters. The DC-3&#x27;s last radio message indicated it was being fired upon at longitude 09.37 West, latitude 46.54 North.

According to German documents, the DC-3 was shot down at , some from Bordeaux, France, and northwest of La Coruña, Spain. &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; records indicate that the Ju 88 maritime fighters were operating beyond their normal patrol area to intercept and shoot down the aircraft. &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Herbert Hintze, &quot;Staffelkapitän&quot; of 14 &quot;Staffel&quot;, V./Kampfgeschwader 40, and based in Bordeaux, stated that his &quot;Staffel&quot; shot down the DC-3 because it was recognized as an enemy aircraft.

Hintze further stated that his pilots were angry that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; leaders had not informed them of a scheduled flight between Lisbon and the UK, and that had they known, they could easily have escorted the DC-3 to Bordeaux and captured it and all aboard. The German pilots photographed the wreckage floating in the Bay of Biscay, and after the war, copies of these captured photographs were sent to Howard&#x27;s family.

The following day, a search of the waters on the route was undertaken by &quot;N/461&quot;, a Short Sunderland flying boat from No. 461 Squadron RAAF. Near the same coordinates where the DC-3 was shot down, the Sunderland was attacked by eight Ju 88s and, after a furious battle, it managed to shoot down three of the attackers, with an additional three &quot;possibles&quot;, before crash-landing at Praa Sands near Penzance. In the aftermath of these two actions, all BOAC flights from Lisbon were re-routed and operated only under the cover of darkness.

The news of Howard&#x27;s death was published in the same issue of &quot;The Times&quot; that reported the &quot;death&quot; of Major William Martin, the &quot;Man who never was&quot; created for the ruse involved in Operation Mincemeat.

===Theories regarding the air attack===
A long-standing but ultimately unsupported hypothesis suggested that the Germans believed that the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, was on board the flight. Churchill&#x27;s history of World War II suggested that the Germans targeted the commercial flight because the British Prime Minister&#x27;s &quot;presence in North Africa [for the 1943 Casablanca conference] had been fully reported&quot;, and German agents at the Lisbon airfield mistook a &quot;thickset man smoking a cigar&quot; boarding the plane for Churchill returning to England. This thickset man was Howard&#x27;s agent, Alfred Chenhalls. The death of the fourteen civilians including Leslie Howard &quot;was a painful shock to me&quot;, Churchill wrote; &quot;the brutality of the Germans was only matched by the stupidity of their agents&quot;.

Two books focusing on the final flight, &quot;Flight 777&quot; (Ian Colvin, 1957) and &quot;In Search of My Father: A Portrait of Leslie Howard&quot; (Ronald Howard, 1984), asserted that the target was Howard instead: that Germans deliberately shot down Howard&#x27;s DC-3 to demoralise Britain. Howard had been travelling through Spain and Portugal lecturing on film, but also meeting with local propagandists and shoring up support for the Allies. The &quot;British Film Yearbook&quot; for 1945 described Leslie Howard&#x27;s work as &quot;one of the most valuable facets of British propaganda&quot;.

The Germans could have suspected even more surreptitious activities, since Portugal, like Switzerland, was a crossroads for internationals and spies from both sides. British historian James Oglethorpe investigated Howard&#x27;s connection to the secret services. Ronald Howard&#x27;s book explores the written German orders to the Ju 88 squadron in great detail, as well as British communiqués that purportedly verify intelligence reports indicating a deliberate attack on Howard. These accounts indicate that the Germans were aware of Churchill&#x27;s real whereabouts at the time and were not so naïve as to believe he would be travelling alone on board an unescorted, unarmed civilian aircraft, which Churchill also acknowledged as improbable. (Coincidentally, Ron Howard&#x27;s financial advisor, who happened to take the same flight, looked like Churchill; Howard bore a resemblance to Churchill&#x27;s bodyguard).

Ronald Howard was convinced the order to shoot down Howard&#x27;s airliner came directly from Joseph Goebbels, Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in Nazi Germany, who had been ridiculed in one of Leslie Howard&#x27;s films, and believed Howard to be the most dangerous British propagandist.

Most of the 13 passengers were either British businessmen with commercial connections to Portugal, or lower-ranking British government civil servants. There were also two or three children of British military personnel. Two passengers were bumped off the flight, George and William Cecil, the teenage sons of Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt, who had been recalled to London from their Swiss boarding school, thus saving their lives.

A 2008 book by Spanish writer José Rey Ximena argues that Howard was on a top-secret mission for Churchill to dissuade Spanish dictator Francisco Franco from joining the Axis powers. Via an old girlfriend, Conchita Montenegro, Howard had contacts with Ricardo Giménez Arnau, a young diplomat in the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Further merely circumstantial background evidence is revealed in Jimmy Burns&#x27;s 2009 biography of his father, spymaster Tom Burns. According to author William Stevenson in &quot;A Man Called Intrepid&quot;, his biography of Sir William Samuel Stephenson (no relation), the senior representative of British Intelligence for the western hemisphere during the Second World War, Stephenson postulated that the Germans knew about Howard&#x27;s mission and ordered the aircraft shot down. Stephenson further argued that Churchill knew in advance of the German intention to shoot down the aircraft but allowed it to proceed to protect the fact that the British had broken the German Enigma code. Former CIA agent Joseph B. Smith recalled that, in 1957, he was briefed by the National Security Agency on the need for secrecy and that Leslie Howard&#x27;s death had been brought up. The NSA stated that Howard knew German fighters would attack the aircraft but went on the plane anyway to protect the British code-breakers&#x27; secret.

A secretly taped account by one of the pilots involved appears in Sönke Neitzel and Harald Welzer&#x27;s &quot;Soldiers: German POWs on Fighting, Killing, and Dying&quot;. In a recently declassified transcript of a surreptitiously recorded conversation by two German Luftwaffe prisoners of war talking about the shooting down of Howard&#x27;s flight, one seems to express pride in his accomplishment, but states clearly he knew nothing of the passengers&#x27; identities or importance until hearing an English broadcast later that evening. Asked why he shot down a civil aircraft, he states it was one of four such planes he shot down: &quot;Whatever crossed our path was shot down.&quot;

The 2010 biography by Estel Eforgan, &quot;Leslie Howard: The Lost Actor&quot;, examines then recently available evidence and concludes that Howard was not a specific target, corroborating the statements by German sources that the shootdown was &quot;an error in judgement&quot;.

There is a monument in San Andrés de Teixido, Spain, dedicated to the victims of the crash. Howard&#x27;s aircraft was shot down over the sea north of this village.

=== &quot;The Mystery of Flight 777&quot; (documentary) ===
&quot;The Mystery of Flight 777&quot;, by film-maker Thomas Hamilton, explores the circumstances, theories and myths which have grown around the shooting down of Howard&#x27;s plane. The film also aims to examine in detail some of the other passengers on board. Originally intended as a short companion piece to the Leslie Howard film, this project expanded in scope and as of January 2021 is still in production.

==Biographies==
Howard&#x27;s premature death preempted any autobiography. A compilation of his writings, &quot;Trivial Fond Records&quot;, edited and with occasional comments by his son Ronald, was published in 1982. This book includes insights on his family life, first impressions of America and Americans when he first moved to the United States to act on Broadway, and his views on democracy in the years prior to and during the Second World War.

Howard&#x27;s son and daughter each published memoirs of their father: &quot;In Search of My Father: A Portrait of Leslie Howard&quot; (1984) by Ronald Howard, and &quot;A Quite Remarkable Father: A Biography of Leslie Howard&quot; (1959) by Leslie Ruth Howard.

Estel Eforgan&#x27;s &quot;Leslie Howard: The Lost Actor&quot; is a full-length book biography published in 2010.

===&quot;Leslie Howard: The Man Who Gave a Damn&quot;===
&quot;Leslie Howard: A Quite Remarkable Life&quot;, as it was initially known, is a film documentary biography produced by Thomas Hamilton of Repo Films. It was shown privately at the NFB Mediatheque, Toronto, Canada in September 2009 for contributors and supporters of the film. Subsequently, re-edited and retitled &quot;Leslie Howard: The Man Who Gave a Damn&quot;, the documentary was officially launched on 2 September 2011 in an event held at Howard&#x27;s former home &quot;Stowe Maries&quot; in Dorking, and reported on BBC South News the same day. Lengthy rights negotiations with Warners then delayed further screenings until May 2012.

From 2012 to early 2014 the film remained in limbo due to these issues. However, in early 2014, independent producer Monty Montgomery and Hamilton entered a co-production agreement to complete and release the documentary. This involved a complete re-edit of the documentary, from June 2014 to February 2015, with added material including archival interviews (Michael Powell, John Houseman, Ronald Howard and Irene Howard - all originally filmed in 1980 for the BBC&#x27;s British Greats series), much historical footage and an additional interview. In addition a score was commissioned from composer Maria Antal and considerable post-production sweetening was undertaken on the original material.

This new version, of &quot; Leslie Howard: The Man Who Gave a Damn&quot; was screened as a &quot;work in progress&quot; at the San Francisco Mostly British Film Festival on 14 February 2015, with Hamilton, Tracy Jenkins and Derek Partridge in attendance. The film won the award for Best Documentary Film.

Subsequent screenings (with minor changes to the commentary) took place at the Chichester International Film Festival on 18 August 2015 at the Regent Street Cinema, London in December 2015 and at the Margaret Mitchell Museum in Atlanta in May 2016 as part of the Britweek Atlanta launch.

&quot;Leslie Howard: The Man Who Gave a Damn&quot; had its world premiere broadcast on Talking Pictures TV on 27 December 2017, followed by the US TV premiere on Turner Classic Movies on 4 June 2018, which opened a month-long tribute to Howard&#x27;s films. It airs regularly on Talking Pictures TV and occasionally on Turner Classic Movies.

==Radio career==
Howard was not only an accomplished actor on stage and screen, he appeared many times on radio as well. Howard began his career on radio in the early 1930s when he performed dramatic readings for &quot;The Yardley Program.&quot; Not much is known about the programme because the recordings have been lost, but references to the show can be found in fan magazines of the time and the show is listed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; radio programme guide. Howard was also a guest performer on such shows as &quot;The Rudy Vallee Show/Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot;, &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Silver Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Magic Key of RCA&quot;, &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; and &quot;Kraft Music Hall with Bing Crosby&quot;.

In May, 1935, Leslie Howard and his daughter, Leslie Ruth Howard, aged 10, appeared on &quot;The Rudy Vallee Show/Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot; in &quot;The Enchanted Forest&quot; scene from James M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Dear Brutus.&quot; The show was so popular with audiences that for the first time in the show&#x27;s history an encore was performed six weeks later on 27 June 1935. That show survives and can be heard on the Old Time Radio Library&#x27;s website.

At the end of 1936 Howard began appearing as a guest on &quot;Eddie Cantor&#x27;s Texaco Town.&quot; It took six months and three appearances before he and Cantor finally delivered the punchline in the skit &quot;Three Pairs of Rubbers.&quot; Howard&#x27;s appearances were not limited to guest spots. Beginning in October 1935 and into the spring of 1936 Howard had his own show on CBS. It was a serial titled &quot;The Amateur Gentleman&quot;. The show eventually became &quot;Leslie Howard&#x27;s Matinee&quot; with each week bringing a new adapted play popular at the time to radio listeners. Howard also appeared in &quot;Columbia Presents Shakespeare&quot; as Benedick in the play &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; with Rosalind Russell in the summer of 1937. Howard produced two shows for &quot;Lux Radio Theatre: Lady for A Day&quot;, starring May Robson and Guy Kibbee, and &quot;The Life of Émile Zola&quot;, starring Paul Muni and Josephine Hutchinson.

His last known radio appearance in the United States before returning to Britain to help with the war effort was the &quot;Radio Tribute to the King and Queen&quot; in which dozens of British stars performed skits while King King George VI and Queen Elizabeth listened with President Roosevelt and Mrs. Roosevelt from Hyde Park. Howard&#x27;s appearances on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Britain Speaks&quot; were broadcast to the United States from 16 July 1940, after the onset of the Second World War, urging America to enter the war in support of Britain. By January 1941 Howard had completed 27 broadcasts of &quot;Britain Speaks&quot;. Howard also appeared on a panel programme for the BBC called &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;.

Most of Howard&#x27;s radio broadcasts have been lost, but a few have survived.

The late Hongkongese singer and actor, Leslie Cheung (Chinese: 張國榮), adopted Leslie as his first name out of his admiration of Howard.

<text>The &quot;Salyut&quot; programme (, , meaning &quot;salute&quot; or &quot;fireworks&quot;) was the first space station programme, undertaken by the Soviet Union. It involved a series of four crewed scientific research space stations and two crewed military reconnaissance space stations over a period of 15 years, from 1971 to 1986. Two other &quot;Salyut&quot; launches failed. In one respect, &quot;Salyut&quot; had the space-race task of carrying out long-term research into the problems of living in space and a variety of astronomical, biological and Earth-resources experiments, and on the other hand, the USSR used this civilian programme as a cover for the highly secretive military &quot;Almaz&quot; stations, which flew under the &quot;Salyut&quot; designation. &quot;Salyut&quot; 1, the first station in the program, became the world&#x27;s first crewed space station.

&quot;Salyut&quot; flights broke several spaceflight records, including several mission-duration records, and achieved the first orbital handover of a space station from one crew to another, and various spacewalk records. The ensuing Soyuz programme was vital for evolving space station technology from a basic, engineering development stage, from single docking port stations to complex, multi-ported, long-term orbital outposts with impressive scientific capabilities, whose technological legacy continues . Experience gained from the &quot;Salyut&quot; stations paved the way for multimodular space stations such as &quot;Mir&quot; and the International Space Station (ISS), with each of those stations possessing a &quot;Salyut&quot;-derived core module at its heart.

&quot;Mir&quot;-2 (DOS-8), the final spacecraft from the &quot;Salyut&quot; series, became one of the first modules of the ISS. The first module of the ISS, the Russian-made &quot;Zarya&quot;, relied heavily on technologies developed in the &quot;Salyut&quot; programme.

== History of Salyut space stations ==
The programme was composed of civilian stations and military stations:

* The Almaz-OPS space station cores were designed in October 1964 by Vladimir Chelomey&#x27;s NPO Mashinostroyeniya (OKB-52) organization as military space stations, long before the Salyut programme started. For Salyut, small modifications had to be made to the docking port of the OPS to accommodate Soyuz spacecraft in addition to TKS spacecraft.
* The civilian DOS space station cores were designed by Sergei Korolev&#x27;s OKB-1 organisation. Korolev and Chelomey had been in fierce competition in the Soviet space industry during the time of the Soviet crewed lunar programme, but OKB-52&#x27;s Almaz-OPS hull design was combined with subsystems derived from OKB-1&#x27;s Soyuz. This was done beginning with conceptual work in August 1969. The DOS differed from the OPS modules in several aspects, including extra solar panels, front and (in Salyut 6 and 7) rear docking ports for Soyuz spacecraft and TKS spacecraft, and finally more docking ports in DOS-7 and DOS-8 to attach further space station modules.

It was realized that the later civilian DOS stations could not only offer a cover story for the military Almaz programme, but could also be finished within one year and at least a year earlier than Almaz. The Salyut programme begun on 15 February 1970 on the condition that the crewed lunar programme would not suffer. However, the engineers at OKB-1 perceived the L3 lunar lander effort as a dead-end and immediately switched to working on DOS. In the end it turned out that the Soviet N1 &quot;Moon Shot&quot; rocket never flew successfully, so OKB-1&#x27;s decision to abandon the lunar programme and derive a DOS space station from existing Soyuz subsystems and an Almaz/OPS hull proved to be right: The actual time from the DOS station&#x27;s inception to the launch of the first DOS-based Salyut 1 space station took only 16 months; the world&#x27;s first space station was launched by the Soviet Union, two years before the American Skylab or the first Almaz/OPS station flew.

Initially, the space stations were to be named &quot;Zarya&quot;, the Russian word for &quot;Dawn&quot;. However, as the launch of the first station in the programme was prepared, it was realised that this would conflict with the call sign &quot;Zarya&quot; of the RKA Mission Control Center (TsUP) in Korolyov – therefore the name of the space stations was changed to &quot;Salyut&quot; shortly before launch of &quot;Salyut 1&quot;. Another explanation given is that the name might have offended the Chinese, who purportedly were preparing a new rocket for launch, which they had already named &quot;Shuguang&quot; or &quot;Dawn&quot;. The Salyut programme was managed by Kerim Kerimov, chairman of the state commission for Soyuz missions.

A total of nine space stations were launched in the Salyut programme, with six successfully hosting crews and setting some records along the way. However, it was the stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 that became the workhorses of the programme. Out of the total of 1,697 days of occupancy that all Salyut crews achieved, Salyut 6 and 7 accounted for 1,499. While Skylab already featured a second docking port, these two Salyut stations became the first that actually utilised two docking ports: this made it possible for two Soyuz spacecraft to dock at the same time for crew exchange of the station and for Progress spacecraft to resupply the station, allowing for the first time a continuous (&quot;permanent&quot;) occupation of space stations.

The heritage of the Salyut programme continued to live on in the first multi-module space station &quot;Mir&quot; with the Mir Core Module (&quot;DOS-7&quot;), that accumulated 4,592 days of occupancy, and in the International Space Station (ISS) with the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module (&quot;DOS-8&quot;), that accumulated 4,310 days of occupancy. Furthermore, the Functional Cargo Block space station modules were derived from the Almaz programme, with the &quot;Zarya&quot; ISS module being still in operation together with &quot;Zvezda&quot;.

=== First generation – The first space stations ===
First generation served as a space station engineering test bed. Aim was from early Almaz beginnings to construct long-living multi-modular stations.

Salyut 3 would make history, by conducting the first test-fire of a conventional weapon in space. During Salyut 3’s mission span, cosmonauts would fire the onboard 23mm cannon, which was reported to be a modified Nudelman aircraft cannon. To operate the cannon, the crew had to maneuver the whole space station in the direction of the target. Sources state that the firing was to deplete the ammunition on the craft. However, others sources say that the station conducted 3 tests of the gun through the whole mission span of Salyut 3.

==== Salyut 5 (OPS-3, military) ====
=== Second generation – long-duration inhabitation of space ===

In 1977, another marked step forward was made with the second generation of Salyut stations. The aim was to continuously occupy a space station with long-duration expeditions, for the first time in spaceflight.

Although Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 resembled the previous Salyut stations in overall design, several revolutionary changes were made to the stations and programme for the aim of continuous occupation. The new stations featured a longer design life and a second docking port at the aft of the stations – crew exchanges and station &quot;handovers&quot; were now made possible by docking two crewed Soyuz spacecraft at the same time. Furthermore, the uncrewed Progress resupply craft was created based on the crewed Soyuz, to resupply the crew and station with air, air regenerators, water, food, clothing, bedding, mail, propellants, pressurant, and other supplies. While the Progress docked to the station&#x27;s second docking port, the crew&#x27;s Soyuz spacecraft could remain docked to the station&#x27;s first port. The Progress spacecraft even delivered hardware for updating onboard experiments and permitting repairs to the station, extending its life.

=== Salyut&#x27;s heritage – modular space stations ===
After the second generation, plans for the next generation of Salyut stations called for the cores DOS-7 and DOS-8 to allow, for the first time in spaceflight, the addition of several modules to a station core and to create a modular space station. For this, the DOS modules were to be equipped with a total of four docking ports: one docking port at the aft of the station as in the second generation Salyuts, and the replacement of the front docking port with a &quot;docking sphere&quot; containing three docking ports — front, port, and starboard.

While the station cores DOS-7 and DOS-8 were built and flown, they never received the Salyut designation. Instead, DOS-7 evolved into the Mir Core Module for the &quot;Mir&quot; space station that followed the Salyut programme, and DOS-8 was used as the &quot;Zvezda&quot; Service Module for the International Space Station (ISS) which followed &quot;Mir&quot;.

The heritage from the Almaz programme is present even today. While the last space station from the Almaz programme was flown as Salyut 5 in 1976, the development of the Almaz TKS spacecraft evolved into the Functional Cargo Block, which formed the basis for several &quot;Mir&quot; modules, the experimental Polyus orbital weapons platform and the &quot;Zarya&quot; module of the ISS.

==== Mir Core Module (DOS-7) ====

DOS-7 continued to be developed during Salyut 7, becoming the Mir Core Module of the &quot;Mir&quot; space station – the first modular space station, with crewed operations lasting from 1986 to 2000. The station featured upgraded computers and solar arrays, and accommodations for two cosmonauts each having their own cabin. A total of six docking ports were available on the Mir Core Module, which were used for space station modules and visiting spacecraft – the docking sphere design had been upgraded from its initial Salyut design to contain a maximum of five docking ports (front, port, starboard, zenith and nadir). And finally, the modules for &quot;Mir&quot; were derived from the Functional Cargo Block design of the Almaz programme.

The name of the &quot;Mir&quot; space station – , literally &quot;Peace&quot; or &quot;World&quot; – was to signify the intentions of the Soviet Union to bring peace to the world. However, it was during the time of &quot;Mir&quot; that the Soviet Union was dissolved in December 1991, ending what was begun with the 1917 October Revolution in Russia. This dissolution had started with the Soviet &quot;perestroika and glasnost&quot; (&quot;restructuring and openness&quot;) reform campaigns by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980s, had reached a preliminary endpoint with the revolutions of 1989 and the end of the communist Eastern Bloc (Warsaw Pact and the Comecon), finally to reach the Soviet Union itself in 1991.

While the Russian Federation became the successor to much of the dissolved Soviet Union and was in a position to continue the Soviet space program with the Russian Federal Space Agency, it faced severe difficulties: imports and exports had steeply declined as the economic exchange with Comecon nations had crumbled away, leaving the industry of the former Soviet Union in shambles. Not only did the political change in eastern Europe signify an end of contributions to the space programme by eastern European nations (such as the East German Carl Zeiss Jena), but parts of the Soviet space industry were located in the newly independent Ukraine, which was similarly cash-strapped as Russia and started to demand hard currency for its contributions.

It was during this time of transition and upheaval that the Shuttle–Mir program was established between the Russian Federation and the United States in 1993. The former adversaries would now cooperate, with &quot;Phase One&quot; consisting of joint missions and flights of the United States Space Shuttle to the Mir space station. It was a partnership with stark contrasts – Russia needed an inflow of hard currency to keep their space programme aloft, while in the United States it was seen as a chance to learn from the over 20 years of experience of Soviet space station operations. It was &quot;Phase Two&quot; of this Shuttle–Mir program that would lead to the International Space Station.

==== &quot;Zvezda&quot; ISS Service Module (DOS-8) ====

DOS-8 evolved into the Mir-2 project, intended to replace &quot;Mir&quot;. Finally, it became the International Space Station (ISS) &quot;Zvezda&quot; Service Module and formed the core of the early ISS together with the &quot;Zarya&quot; module (which was derived from Almaz Functional Cargo Block designs).

== Data table ==
The first generation of Salyut stations received few craft for rendezvous and docking. By contrast the programme&#x27;s second generation stations, Salyut 6 and Salyut 7, received multiple crewed and uncrewed craft for rendezvous, docking attempts (whether successful or not), human habitation, crew transfer, and supply. The table counts craft which achieved rendezvous with their targets as visiting craft, regardless of whether they docked successfully.

<doc id="83543" wikidata="Q2863" url="?curid=83543" title="Eau de Cologne">
<text>Eau de Cologne (; German: Kölnisch Wasser ; meaning &quot;Water from Cologne&quot;) or simply cologne is a perfume originating in Cologne, Germany. Originally mixed by Johann Maria Farina (Giovanni Maria Farina) in 1709, it has since come to be a generic term for scented formulations in typical concentration of 2–5% and also more depending upon its type of essential oils or a blend of extracts, alcohol, and water. In a base of dilute ethanol (70–90%), eau de cologne contains a mixture of citrus oils, including oils of lemon, orange, tangerine, clementine, bergamot, lime, grapefruit, blood orange, bitter orange, and neroli. It can also contain oils of lavender, rosemary, thyme, oregano, petitgrain (orange leaf), jasmine, olive, oleaster, and tobacco.

In contemporary American English usage, the term &quot;cologne&quot; has become a generic term for perfumes marketed toward men. It also may signify a less concentrated, more affordable, version of a popular perfume.

==History==
The original &quot;Eau de Cologne&quot; is a spirit-citrus perfume launched in Cologne in 1709 by Giovanni Maria Farina (1685–1766), an Italian perfume maker from Santa Maria Maggiore, Valle Vigezzo. In 1708, Farina wrote to his brother Jean Baptiste: &quot;I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain&quot;. He named his fragrance &quot;Eau de Cologne&quot;, in honour of his new hometown.

The &quot;Eau de Cologne&quot; created by Farina was used only as a perfume and delivered to &quot;nearly all royal houses in Europe&quot;. His ability to produce a constantly homogeneous fragrance consisting of dozens of monoessences was seen as a sensation at the time. A single vial of this &quot;aqua mirabilis&quot; (Latin for miracle water) cost half the annual salary of a civil servant. When free trade was established in Cologne by the French in 1797, the success of &quot;Eau de Cologne&quot; prompted countless other businessmen to sell their own fragrances under the name of &quot;Eau de Cologne&quot;. Giovanni Maria Farina&#x27;s formula has been produced in Cologne since 1709 by Farina opposite the Jülichplatz and to this day remains a secret. His shop at Obenmarspforten opened in 1709 and is the world&#x27;s oldest fragrance factory.

The &quot;Original Eau de Cologne 4711&quot; is named after its location at Glockengasse No. 4711. It was also developed in the 18th century by Wilhelm Mülhens and produced in Cologne since at least 1799 and is therefore probably one of the oldest fragrances still produced in the world. On 12 December 2006, the perfumes and cosmetics company Mäurer &amp; Wirtz took over 4711 from Procter &amp; Gamble and has expanded it to a whole brand since then.

In 1806, Jean Marie Joseph Farina, a great-grand-nephew of Giovanni Maria Farina, opened a perfumery business in Paris that was later sold to Roger &amp; Gallet. That company now owns the rights to &quot;Eau de Cologne extra vieille&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;Original Eau de Cologne&quot; from Cologne. Originally the water of Cologne was believed to have the power to ward off bubonic plague. By drinking the cologne, the citrus oil scent would exude through the pores, repelling fleas. Many flea shampoos for dogs are based on citrus oils today.

In modern times, &quot;eau de Cologne&quot; or &quot;cologne&quot; has become a generic term. The term &quot;cologne&quot; can be applied to perfume for men or women, but in American English, usage typically refers to perfumes marketed toward men.
===Cologne in Turkish culture===

After the fame of the cologne became widespread, Farina&#x27;s cologne was brought to the Ottoman Empire during the reign of Abdülhamid II. It was common to offer rose water to guests in the Ottoman Empire at that time, but the tradition of offering cologne began after it became popular there. In 1882, the first local cologne was produced in the Ottoman Empire by Ahmet Faruk. Eau de Cologne, which is called odikolon by the people, has taken the name of cologne over time. Even after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the habit of cologne did not end in Turkey. On the contrary, it became a culture that was passed on from generation to generation. Currently, in most houses in Turkey, cologne is offered to guests every time they visit.

==Literary references==
Yevgeny Yevtushenko&#x27;s poem &quot;About Drinking&quot; describes the author coming back from a whaling voyage and arriving at a small town where the local store is out of liquor and, as a substitute, they use a case of Eau de Cologne to drink.

<doc id="83545" wikidata="Q1249536" url="?curid=83545" title="The Scarlet Pimpernel">
<text>The Scarlet Pimpernel is the first novel in a series of historical fiction by Baroness Orczy, published in 1905. It was written after her stage play of the same title (co-authored with her husband Montague Barstow) enjoyed a long run in London, having opened in Nottingham in 1903.

The novel is set during the Reign of Terror following the start of the French Revolution. The title is the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; of its hero and protagonist, a chivalrous Englishman who rescues aristocrats before they are sent to the guillotine. Sir Percy Blakeney leads a double life: apparently nothing more than a wealthy fop, but in reality, a formidable swordsman and a quick-thinking master of disguise and escape artist. The band of gentlemen who assist him are the only ones who know of his secret identity. He is known by his symbol, a simple flower, the scarlet pimpernel (&quot;Anagallis arvensis&quot;).

Opening at the New Theatre in London&#x27;s West End on 5 January 1905, the play became a favourite of British audiences, eventually playing more than 2,000 performances and becoming one of the most popular shows staged in London. Published after the success of the play, the novel was an immediate success, gaining Orczy a following of readers in Britain and the rest of the world. The stage play and subsequent novel, with their hero and villain, were so popular that they inspired a revival of classic villainy at the time.

Orczy&#x27;s premise of a daring hero who cultivates a secret identity disguised by a meek or ineffectual manner proved enduring. Zorro, Doctor Syn, the Shadow, the Spider, the Phantom, Superman and Batman followed within a few decades, and the trope remains a popular one in serial fiction today. Read by Stan Lee as a boy, the Marvel co-creator called The Scarlet Pimpernel &quot;the first character who could be called a superhero.&quot;

==Plot==

In 1792, an early stage of the French Revolution, Marguerite St. Just, a beautiful French actress, is married to wealthy English fop Sir Percy Blakeney, baronet. Before their marriage Marguerite took revenge upon the Marquis de St. Cyr, who had ordered her brother beaten for his romantic interest in the Marquis&#x27; daughter, with the unintended consequence that the Marquis and his sons were guillotined. When Percy found out, he became estranged from his wife. Marguerite, for her part, became disillusioned with Percy&#x27;s shallow, dandyish lifestyle.

Meanwhile, the &quot;League of the Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, a secret society of twenty English aristocrats, &quot;one to command, and nineteen to obey&quot;, is engaged in rescuing their French counterparts from the daily executions of the Reign of Terror. Their leader, the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel, takes his &quot;nom de guerre&quot; from the small, wayside red flower he draws on his messages. Despite being the talk of London society, only his followers and possibly the Prince of Wales know the Pimpernel&#x27;s true identity. Like many others, Marguerite is entranced by the Pimpernel&#x27;s daring exploits.
At a ball attended by the Blakeneys, Percy&#x27;s verse about the &quot;elusive Pimpernel&quot; becomes an instant success. But Marguerite is being blackmailed by Citizen Chauvelin, the wily new French envoy to England: Chauvelin&#x27;s agents have stolen a letter proving that her beloved brother Armand is in league with the Pimpernel. Chauvelin offers to trade Armand&#x27;s life for her help against the Pimpernel. Contemptuous of her seemingly witless and unloving husband, Marguerite does not go to him for help or advice. Instead, she passes along information which enables Chauvelin to learn the Pimpernel&#x27;s true identity.
Later that night, Marguerite finally tells her husband of the terrible danger threatening her brother and pleads for his help. Percy promises to save him. After Percy unexpectedly leaves for France, Marguerite discovers to her horror (and simultaneous delight) that &quot;he&quot; is the Pimpernel. He had hidden behind the persona of a dull, slow-witted fop to deceive the world. He had not told Marguerite because of his worry that she might betray him, as she had the Marquis de St. Cyr. Desperate to save her husband, she decides to pursue Percy to France to warn him that Chauvelin knows his identity and his purpose. She persuades Sir Andrew Ffoulkes to accompany her, but because of the tide and the weather, neither they nor Chauvelin can leave immediately.

At Calais, Percy openly approaches Chauvelin in the &quot;Chat gris&quot;, a decrepit inn whose owner is in Percy&#x27;s pay. Despite Chauvelin&#x27;s best efforts, the Englishman escapes by offering Chauvelin a pinch of snuff, which turns out to be pure pepper. Through a bold plan executed right under Chauvelin&#x27;s nose, Percy rescues Marguerite&#x27;s brother Armand and the Comte de Tournay, the father of a schoolfriend of Marguerite&#x27;s. Marguerite pursues Percy right to the very end, determined to either warn him or share his fate. Percy, heavily disguised, is captured by Chauvelin, who does not recognise him, so he is able to escape.

With Marguerite&#x27;s love and courage amply proven, Percy&#x27;s ardour is rekindled. Safely back on board their schooner, the &quot;Day Dream&quot;, the happily reconciled couple returns to England. Sir Andrew marries the count&#x27;s daughter, Suzanne.

==Characters==

* Sir Percy Blakeney: He is a wealthy English baronet who rescues individuals sentenced to death by the guillotine. He soon reveals himself to be a master of disguise, an imaginative planner, a formidable swordsman and a quick-thinking escape artist. With each rescue he taunts his enemies by leaving behind a card showing a small flower—a scarlet pimpernel. The identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel thus becomes a topic of widespread popular interest and the hero himself becomes the subject of an international manhunt by the French revolutionary authorities. To hide his true identity, Sir Percy presents himself in everyday life as a dim-witted, foppish playboy. His secret is kept by a band of friends known as the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel. The league operates as an undercover team in enacting Sir Percy&#x27;s rescue plans.
* Marguerite Blakeney, née St Just: She is married to Sir Percy. She leads London society with her beauty, style and intelligence. She was an actress in Paris, where she held salons to discuss the issues of the day. She was not an aristocrat in French society.
* Armand St Just: Older brother of Marguerite, who raised her after their parents died. He is a gentleman and a republican in France, but his views of the slaughter of the aristocracy do not match the times.
* Citizen Chauvelin: Newly appointed envoy to England from Revolutionary France. He seeks the Scarlet Pimpernel, who is allowing aristocrats to escape their fate under the new regime.
* Sir Andrew Ffoulkes: Friend of Sir Percy who aids Marguerite when she realizes her mistake. He falls in love with an émigrée, a girl who had been at school with Marguerite.
* Suzanne: Daughter of Comte de Tournay, also a friend of Marguerite&#x27;s; she is the love interest of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes.

==Literary significance==

The title character, Sir Percy Blakeney, a wealthy English fop who transforms into a formidable swordsman and a quick-thinking escape artist, established the &quot;hero with a secret identity&quot; in popular culture, a trope that would be seen in subsequent literary creations such as Don Diego de la Vega (Zorro), Kent Allard/Lamont Cranston (The Shadow), Clark Kent (Superman), and Bruce Wayne (Batman). The Scarlet Pimpernel exhibits characteristics that would become standard superhero conventions, including the penchant for disguise, use of a signature weapon (sword), ability to out-think and outwit his adversaries, and a calling card (he leaves behind a scarlet pimpernel at each of his interventions). By drawing attention to his alter ego, Blakeney hides behind his public face as a slow-thinking, foppish playboy, and he also establishes a network of supporters, The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, that aids his endeavours. A plot technique from &quot;Pimpernel&quot; also used by some superheroes is the spurious &quot;love triangle&quot;, where a woman is torn between attraction to her staid husband and the dashing hero—although they are in reality the same man. Marvel co-creator Stan Lee stated: &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel was the first superhero I had read about, the first character who could be called a superhero.&quot;

The popular success of the novel is considered to be based on the myth of the aristocratic hero with a double life, along with the love story and conflict of loyalties. Dugan says that &quot;Behind the wigs and Mechlin lace cuffs lies an enduring human story of love, misunderstandings, conflict of loyalties, audacious bravery – and a dramatic double life.&quot; and this is a major part of the story&#x27;s enduring popularity. Another aspect is the &quot;Englishness&quot; of the hero in the era when the British Empire began to shrink.

==Historical allusions==
As a writer, Orczy often alluded to historical events and figures but adapted these freely in creating her tales.

Citizen Chauvelin, the recurring villain of the &quot;Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; series, is based to some extent on the real-life Bernard-François, marquis de Chauvelin, who survived the Revolutionary period to serve as an official under Napoleon. He was a noted liberal Deputy under the Bourbon Restoration.

Other historical figures who appear in Orczy&#x27;s &quot;Pimpernel&quot; series include:
* Maximilien Robespierre
* Louis Antoine de Saint-Just
* Jean-Lambert Tallien
* Thérésa Tallien
* Georges Danton
* François Chabot
* Fabre d&#x27;Églantine
* The Prince of Wales (later, King George IV)
* Claude Basire
* Jean, Baron de Batz
* Jean-Paul Marat
* Paul Barras
* Georges Couthon
* Bertrand Barère
* Éléonore Duplay
* Collot d&#x27;Herbois
==Publishing history==
===Initial publication===
Orczy wrote the original manuscript for &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; in five weeks during what she described as &quot;The happiest time of her life&quot;. It was rejected by most publishing houses in London, despite her previous successes with her armchair detective stories, primarily &quot;The Old Man in the Corner&quot; which first appeared in &quot;The Royal Magazine&quot; in 1901 in a series of six &quot;Mysteries of London&quot;. Eventually a friend put Orczy in contact with the actors Fred Terry and Julia Neilson who wanted a new romantic drama. &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; was produced and adapted by Neilson and Terry and the play opened on 15 October 1903 at Nottingham&#x27;s Theatre Royal, but it was not a success. Terry, however, had confidence in the play and, with a rewritten last act, took it to London&#x27;s West End where it opened at the New Theatre on 5 January 1905. The premiere of the London production was enthusiastically received by the audience, but critics considered the play &quot;old-fashioned&quot;. In spite of negative reviews, the play became a popular success, running 122 performances and enjoying numerous revivals. &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; became a favourite of London audiences, playing more than 2,000 performances and becoming one of the most popular shows staged in the United Kingdom. The stage play (and subsequent novel), with their hero and villain, were so popular that they inspired a revival of classic villainy at the time.

The novel &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; was published two years after the play opened and was an immediate success. Orczy gained a following of readers in Britain and throughout the world. The popularity of the novel encouraged her to write a number of sequels for her &quot;reckless daredevil&quot; over the next 35 years. The play was performed to great acclaim in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, while the novel was popular across the former British Empire and translated into 16 languages. Subsequently, the story has been adapted for television, film, a musical and other media.

The commercial success of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; allowed Orczy and her husband to live out their lives in luxury. Over the years, they lived on an estate in Kent, a bustling London home and an opulent villa in Monte Carlo. Conceiving the character while standing on a platform on the London Underground, Orczy wrote in her autobiography, &quot;Links in the Chain of Life&quot;:
I have so often been asked the question: &quot;But how did you come to think of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel?&quot;&quot; And my answer has always been: &quot;It was God&#x27;s will that I should.&quot; And to you moderns, who perhaps do not believe as I do, I will say, &quot;In the chain of my life, there were so many links, all of which tended towards bringing me to the fulfillment of my destiny.&quot;
===Sequels===
Orczy wrote numerous sequels, none of which became as famous as &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. Many of the sequels revolve around French characters whom Sir Percy has met and is attempting to rescue. His followers, such as Lord Tony Dewhurst, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, Lord Hastings, and Armand St. Just (Marguerite&#x27;s brother), also take their turn in major roles.

In addition to the direct sequels about Sir Percy and his league, Orczy&#x27;s related books include &quot;The Laughing Cavalier&quot; (1914) and &quot;The First Sir Percy&quot; (1921), about an ancestor of the Pimpernel&#x27;s; &quot;Pimpernel and Rosemary&quot; (1924), about a descendant; and &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel Looks at the World&quot; (1933), a depiction of the 1930s world from the point of view of Sir Percy.

Some of her non-related Revolutionary-period novels reference the Scarlet Pimpernel or the League, most notably &quot;The Bronze Eagle&quot; (1915).

==Members of the League==
&quot;The Life and Exploits of the Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, a fictional biography of Percy Blakeney published in 1938, named the nineteen members of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel.
* The original nine league or founder members who formed the party on 2 August 1792: Sir Andrew Ffoulkes (second in command), Lord Anthony Dewhurst, Lord Edward Hastings, Lord John Bathurst, Lord Stowmarries, Sir Edward Mackenzie, Sir Philip Glynde, Lord Saint Denys, and Sir Richard Galveston.
* Ten members enrolled in January 1793: Sir Jeremiah Wallescourt, Lord Kulmstead, Lord George Fanshawe, Anthony Holte, John Hastings (Lord Edward&#x27;s cousin), Lord Everingham, Sir George Vigor, Bart., The Honorable St. John Devinne, Michael Barstow of York and Armand St. Just (Marguerite&#x27;s brother).

Three members of the League have betrayed their oath of loyalty:
* In the short story &quot;The Traitor&quot; in &quot;The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, in November 1793 while accompanying the League on a mission to rescue &quot;some women of the late unfortunate Marie Antoinette&#x27;s household: maids and faithful servants, ruthlessly condemned to die for their tender adherence to a martyred queen&quot;, Lord Kulmstead seduces a young girl into helping set a trap for the Scarlet Pimpernel, but the Pimpernel escapes and an unrepentant Kulmstead is captured and sent to Paris (presumably for trial and execution). In the radio series episode &quot;The Traitor&quot; (30 November 1952), Kulmstead is attempting to betray the League when he is shot and killed by League member Robert Kent.
* St. John Devinne&#x27;s betrayal of Sir Percy forms an important part of the novel &quot;Sir Percy Leads the Band&quot;, but Devinne later regrets and repents his actions, and his treachery is forgiven by Sir Percy. While his treachery is never revealed to the other members of the League, it is hinted that to regain his lost honor he will join the British Army when England and France finally declare war.
* In the novel &quot;Eldorado&quot;, Armand St. Just betrays Sir Percy to Chauvelin in order to save the life of Jeanne L&#x27;Ange, with whom he has fallen in love, not knowing that Sir Percy has already rescued her and transported her to safety. Like Devinne, Armand is tormented by what he has done, but Sir Percy also forgives him.

Marguerite, Lady Blakeney, is also named as a member of the League in the book &quot;Mam&#x27;zelle Guillotine&quot;, but it is not known when she was formally enrolled. The Prince Regent is rumored to also be a member of the League, but in the original novel he refuses to confirm or deny this, saying &quot;My lips are sealed!&quot;; in the novel &quot;The Elusive Pimpernel&quot;, Sir Percy tells Marguerite that he has had to report to the Prince before joining her at the village gala.

==Chronology of novels in the series==
Orczy did not publish her Pimpernel stories as a strict chronological series, and in fact, the settings of the books in their publication sequence may vary forward or backward in time by months or centuries. While some readers enjoy following the author&#x27;s development of the Pimpernel character as it was realised, others prefer to read the stories in historical sequence. Taking into account occasional discrepancies in the dates of events (real and fictional) referred to in the stories, the following is an approximate chronological listing of Orczy&#x27;s Scarlet Pimpernel novels and short stories:

==Adaptations==
Hollywood took to the Pimpernel early and often, although most of the Pimpernel movies have been based on a melange of the original book and another Orczy novel, &quot;Eldorado&quot;. The best known of the Pimpernel movies is the 1934 &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; starring Leslie Howard, which is often considered the definitive portrayal and adaptation.

===Films===
In 1923, Fred Terry and Julia Nelson bought the sole performance right to a stageplay based on &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. Orczy sued the two in an attempt to claim a separate right of performance for films, but was unsuccessful. As a result of the case, people who controlled a stage performance right under the English Copyright Act were entitled to create films with the same right.

* It was parodied as a 1950 Warner Bros. cartoon short featuring Daffy Duck, &quot;The Scarlet Pumpernickel&quot;. An action figure of the Scarlet Pumpernickel was released by DC Direct in 2006, making it one of the few—if not the only—toys produced based on the Pimpernel.
* In 1953, following Jack Kyle&#x27;s performance for the Ireland national rugby union team against France in that year&#x27;s Five Nations Championship, sportswriter Paul MacWeeney adapted lines from the work to salute Kyle.
* The Scarlet Pimpernel was parodied extensively in the &quot;Carry On&quot; film &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Your Head&quot;, which featured Sid James as the Black Fingernail, who helps French aristocrats escape the guillotine while hiding behind the foppish exterior of British aristocrat Sir Rodney Ffing. It also features Jim Dale as his assistant, Lord Darcy. They must rescue preposterously effete aristocrat Charles Hawtrey from the clutches of Kenneth Williams&#x27; fiendish Citizen Camembert and his sidekick Citizen Bidet (Peter Butterworth).
* The Kinks 1966 song &quot;Dedicated Follower of Fashion&quot; contain two lines from the book; &quot;they seek him here, they seek him there&quot;; these lyrics also appear in the 1993 film &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; when Gerry Conlon (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) returns home to Belfast in hippie-style clothing that he got from London&#x27;s Carnaby Street.
* In the third series of &quot;Blackadder&quot;, &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;, the episode &quot;Nob and Nobility&quot; revolves around Blackadder&#x27;s disgust with the English nobility&#x27;s fascination for the Pimpernel. Tim McInnerny reprises a version of his &quot;Sir Percy&quot; character from the previous two series, who is the alter ego of the Pimpernel, who acts a bit like James Bond.
* In &quot;The Desert Song&quot;, the heroic &quot;Red Shadow&quot; has a milquetoast alter ego modelled after Sir Percy.
* The character was parodied in a lengthy comedy sketch on &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; (series 11, episode 1, 1980). Portrayed by Hill himself, the &quot;Scarlet Pimple&quot; spends just as much of his time unsuccessfully pursuing women as he does rescuing people. When one woman repeatedly shuns his advances, he leaves in a huff and refuses to rescue the next woman being sent to the guillotine.
* The Canadian comedy team of Wayne and Shuster created a comedy sketch in 1957 based on the Scarlet Pimpernel called &quot;The Brown Pumpernickel&quot;, in which, instead of a red flower as his calling card, the hero would leave behind a loaf of pumpernickel.
* In &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot; episode &quot;The Unmasked Avenger&quot;, Huckleberry Hound dons a masked avenger identity called the &quot;Purple Pumpernickel&quot;, an obvious spoof of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Coincidentally during the episode&#x27;s opening narration, the Scarlet Pimpernel was seen among the different masked avengers like the Green Gadfly and the White Crusader. After Huckleberry Hound as the Purple Pumpernickel defeated the evil lord (voiced by Don Messick) that oppressed the land, he revealed his identity to the people where he will bring about changes upon the lords defeat even though it may cause some taxes to handle the new roads, free schools, and old age pension. He is then confronted by a masked avenger known as the Blue Bouncer (voiced by Don Messick) who rights wrongs and is chased by him as Huck quotes that taxes get folks all riled up as the episode ends.
* In 1972, Burt Reynolds portrayed the &quot;Lavender Pimpernel&quot; in a season 5 episode of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;.
* Sir Percy and Marguerite are mentioned as members of an 18th-century incarnation of &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; in the graphic novels of that title by Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill and make a more significant appearance in &quot;The Black Dossier&quot;, in the accounts of both Orlando and Fanny Hill, with whom Percy and Marguerite are revealed to have been romantically involved.
* A series of novels by Lauren Willig, beginning with &quot;The Secret History of the Pink Carnation&quot; (2005), chronicle the adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel&#x27;s associates, including the Purple Gentian (alias of Lord Richard Selwick), spies in the Napoleonic era.
* Steve Jackson Games published &quot;GURPS Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, by Robert Traynor and Lisa Evans in 1991, a supplement for playing the milieu using the GURPS roleplaying game system.
* In &quot;E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)&quot;, a 1999 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the Scarlet Pimpernel appears as the antagonist in the fictional film &quot;The Poke of Zorro&quot;.
* The 2003 film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; is set in 1805 and features a boy named Blakeney, whose father is named Sir Percy Blakeney, suggesting he is the son of the Scarlet Pimpernel.
* Writer Geoffrey Trease wrote his adventure novel &quot;Thunder of Valmy&quot; (1960; US title &quot;Victory at Valmy&quot;) partly as a response to Orczy&#x27;s Pimpernel novels, which he argued were giving children a misleading image of the French Revolution. &quot;Thunder of Valmy&quot; revolves around the adventures of a peasant boy, Pierre Mercier, during the start of the Revolution, and his persecution by a tyrannical Marquis.
* Famed British barrister Sir Desmond Lorenz de Silva, QC, is often referred to by Fleet Street papers as &quot;the Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, because of his uncanny penchant for saving clients facing the death penalty outside the UK.
* Writer Diana Peterfreund took inspiration from the Scarlet Pimpernel for her book &quot;Across the Star Swept Sea&quot;. The main character, Persis Blake, pretends to be a shallow aristocrat while actually being the notorious spy &quot;The Wild Poppy&quot;.
* In the 2014 videogame &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Unity&quot;, protagonist Arno Dorian may encounter a man known as the &quot;Crimson Rose&quot;, the leader of the &quot;Crimson League&quot;, a royalist organization which saves aristocrats from the guillotine. However, it is later discovered that Crimson Rose is a Templar, and he and the League are wiped out by Arno.
* Dewey Lambdin includes an homage to the Scarlet Pimpernel in his book &quot;King, Ship, and Sword&quot;, in the character of a foppish Sir Pulteney Plumb who was known as &quot;The Yellow Tansy&quot;.
* Philip José Farmer&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan Alive: A Definitive Biography of Lord Greystoke&quot; includes the Scarlet Pimpernel as a member of the Wold Newton family. Farmer suggests that Sir Percy was present when the Wold Cottage meteorite fell near Wold Newton, Yorkshire, England, on 13 December 1795. Win Scott Eckert wrote two Wold Newton short stories featuring the Scarlet Pimpernel, both taking place in 1795: &quot;Is He in Hell?&quot; and &quot;The Wild Huntsman.&quot; Eckert also constructed a &quot;fictional genealogy&quot; for the Pimpernel in his essay &quot;The Blakeney Family Tree.&quot;
* In the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; episode &quot;Druselsteinoween&quot;, multiple characters dress as the Scarlet Pimpernel for a Halloween party in a castle. This is used for comedic effect as one of the Pimpernels uses the others as decoys to avoid his father, who disapproves of his son&#x27;s girlfriend because she is the daughter of his sworn enemy.
* In the &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode &quot;Friendship Hates Magic,&quot; the Scarlet Pimpernel is parodied as the Scarlet Pimperbill, whom Launchpad McQuack mistakes for Darkwing Duck due to the very similar design of the two characters.
* In the comic strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, the character called &quot;the Red Rascal&quot; has a story line which parodies the original.
* In the &quot;Babar&quot; episode &quot;The Scarlet Pachyderm&quot;, the title character is a parody of the Scarlet Pimpernel.
* In the book &quot;Scarlet&quot; by Genevieve Cogman, the characters of the Scarlet Pimpernel make appearances as both protagonists and antagonists, with the Blakeneys being connected to some of the vampiric aristocrats of the book&#x27;s plot.

==Pimpernel used to name real rescuers==
===The Tartan Pimpernel (Donald Caskie)===
Inspired by the title &quot;Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, the Tartan Pimpernel was a nickname given to the Reverend Donald Caskie (1902–1983), formerly minister of the Paris congregation of the Church of Scotland, for aiding over 2,000 Allied service personnel to escape from occupied France during World War II.

===The American Pimpernel (Varian Fry)===
Varian Fry was a 32-year-old Harvard-educated classicist and editor from New York City who helped save thousands of endangered refugees who were caught in Vichy France, helping them to escape from Nazi terror during World War II. His story is told in &quot;American Pimpernel: The Man Who Saved the Artists on Hitler&#x27;s Death List&quot;.

===The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican (Hugh O&#x27;Flaherty)===
Monsignor Hugh O&#x27;Flaherty was an Irish priest who saved thousands of people, British and American servicemen and Jews, during World War II while in the Vatican in Rome. His story is told in two books and a film:

* J. P. Gallagher (1968), &quot;Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican&quot;, New York: Coward-McCann
* Brian Fleming (2008), &quot;The Vatican Pimpernel: The Wartime Exploits of Monsignor Hugh O’Flaherty&quot;, Collins Press
* &quot;The Scarlet and the Black&quot;, a 1983 made-for-television movie starring Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer

===The Black Pimpernel===
====Harald Edelstam====
Harald Edelstam (1913–1989) was a Swedish diplomat. During World War II, he earned the nickname &quot;Svarta nejlikan&quot; (&quot;the Black Pimpernel&quot;) for helping Norwegian resistance fighters in escape from the Germans. Stationed in Chile in the 1970s, he arranged for the escape of numerous refugees from the military junta of Augusto Pinochet; this brought him into conflict with the regime, and he eventually was forced to leave the country.

====Nelson Mandela====
This name was also given to Nelson Mandela prior to his arrest and long incarceration for his anti-apartheid activities in South Africa due to his effective use of disguises when evading capture by the police.

====Walter Sisulu====
&quot;Behind the scenes, Mandela worked very closely with Walter Sisulu, who was now being pursued by the police. Z.K. Matthews told the Cape ANC in June that Sisulu was operating behind the &#x27;Iron Curtain&#x27; of the Transkei as a Scarlet Pimpernel (before Mandela inherited the title): &#x27;They sought him here, they sought him there, they sought him everywhere. Quote cites: &quot;Karis &amp; Carter&quot;, Vol.3, op. cit., p.128

===Raoul Wallenberg===
Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat, was directly inspired by &quot;&quot;Pimpernel&quot; Smith&quot;, a 1941 British anti-Nazi propaganda thriller, to begin rescuing Hungarian Jews during World War II. The film had been banned in Sweden, but Wallenberg and his sister Nina were invited to a private screening at the British Embassy in Stockholm. Enthralled by Professor Smith (played by Leslie Howard), who saved thousands of Jews from the Nazis, Nina stated, &quot;We thought the film was amazing. When we got up from our seats, Raoul said, &#x27;that is the kind of thing I would like to do. Wallenberg issued false passports identifying the Jews as Swedish nationals, and is credited with rescuing at least 15,000 Jews. He disappeared in Eastern Europe after the war, and is believed to have died in a Soviet prison camp.

<doc id="83552" wikidata="Q3487828" url="?curid=83552" title="Subsumption architecture">
<text>Subsumption architecture is a reactive robotic architecture heavily associated with behavior-based robotics which was very popular in the 1980s and 90s. The term was introduced by Rodney Brooks and colleagues in 1986. Subsumption has been widely influential in autonomous robotics and elsewhere in real-time AI.

==Overview==
Subsumption architecture is a control architecture that was proposed in opposition to traditional symbolic AI. Instead of guiding behavior by symbolic mental representations of the world, subsumption architecture couples sensory information to action selection in an intimate and bottom-up fashion.

It does this by decomposing the complete behavior into sub-behaviors. These sub-behaviors are organized into a hierarchy of layers. Each layer implements a particular level of behavioral competence, and higher levels are able to subsume lower levels (= integrate/combine lower levels to a more comprehensive whole) in order to create viable behavior. For example, a robot&#x27;s lowest layer could be &quot;avoid an object&quot;. The second layer would be &quot;wander around&quot;, which runs beneath the third layer &quot;explore the world&quot;. Because a robot must have the ability to &quot;avoid objects&quot; in order to &quot;wander around&quot; effectively, the subsumption architecture creates a system in which the higher layers utilize the lower-level competencies. The layers, which all receive sensor-information, work in parallel and generate outputs. These outputs can be commands to actuators, or signals that suppress or inhibit other layers.

==Goal==
Subsumption architecture attacks the problem of intelligence from a significantly different perspective than traditional AI. Disappointed with the performance of Shakey the robot and similar conscious mind representation-inspired projects, Rodney Brooks started creating robots based on a different notion of intelligence, resembling unconscious mind processes. Instead of modelling aspects of human intelligence via symbol manipulation, this approach is aimed at real-time interaction and viable responses to a dynamic lab or office environment.

The goal was informed by four key ideas:
*Situatedness – A major idea of situated AI is that a robot should be able to react to its environment within a human-like time-frame. Brooks argues that situated mobile robot should not represent the world via an internal set of symbols and then act on this model. Instead, he claims that &quot;the world is its own best model&quot;, which means that proper perception-to-action setups can be used to directly interact with the world as opposed to modelling it. Yet, each module/behavior still models the world, but on a very low level, close to the sensorimotor signals. These simple models necessarily use hardcoded assumptions about the world encoded in the algorithms themselves, but avoid the use of memory to predict the world&#x27;s behavior, instead relying on direct sensorial feedback as much as possible.
*Embodiment – Brooks argues building an embodied agent accomplishes two things. The first is that it forces the designer to test and create an integrated physical control system, not theoretic models or simulated robots that might not work in the physical world. The second is that it can solve the symbol grounding problem, a philosophical issue many traditional AIs encounter, by directly coupling sense-data to meaningful actions. &quot;The world grounds regress,&quot; and the internal relation of the behavioral layers are directly grounded in the world the robot perceives.
*Intelligence – Looking at evolutionary progress, Brooks argues that developing perceptual and mobility skills are a necessary foundation for human-like intelligence. Also, by rejecting top-down representations as a viable starting point for AI, it seems that &quot;intelligence is determined by the dynamics of interaction with the world.&quot;
*Emergence – Conventionally, individual modules are not considered intelligent by themselves. It is the interaction of such modules, evaluated by observing the agent and its environment, that is usually deemed intelligent (or not). &quot;Intelligence,&quot; therefore, &quot;is in the eye of the observer.&quot;

The ideas outlined above are still a part of an ongoing debate regarding the nature of intelligence and how the progress of robotics and AI should be fostered.

==Layers and augmented finite-state machines==
Each layer is made up by a set of processors that are augmented finite-state machines (AFSM), the augmentation being added instance variables to hold programmable data-structures. A layer is a module and is responsible for a single behavioral goal, such as &quot;wander around.&quot; There is no central control within or between these behavioral modules. All AFSMs continuously and asynchronously receive input from the relevant sensors and send output to actuators (or other AFSMs). Input signals that are not read by the time a new one is delivered end up getting discarded. These discarded signals are common, and is useful for performance because it allows the system to work in real time by dealing with the most immediate information.

Because there is no central control, AFSMs communicate with each other via inhibition and suppression signals. Inhibition signals block signals from reaching actuators or AFSMs, and suppression signals blocks or replaces the inputs to layers or their AFSMs. This system of AFSM communication is how higher layers subsume lower ones (see figure 1), as well as how the architecture deals with priority and action selection arbitration in general.

The development of layers follows an intuitive progression. First, the lowest layer is created, tested, and debugged. Once that lowest level is running, one creates and attaches the second layer with the proper suppression and inhibition connections to the first layer. After testing and debugging the combined behavior, this process can be repeated for (theoretically) any number of behavioral modules.

==Robots==
The following is a small list of robots that utilize the subsumption architecture.

*Allen (robot)
*Herbert, a soda can collecting robot (see external links for a video)
*Genghis, a robust hexapodal walker (see external links for a video)

The above are described in detail along with other robots in &quot;Elephants Don&#x27;t Play Chess&quot;.

==Strengths and weaknesses==

The main advantages of the architecture are:
*the emphasis on iterative development and testing of real-time systems in their target domain;
*the emphasis on connecting limited, task-specific perception directly to the expressed actions that require it; and
*the emphasis on distributive and parallel control, thereby integrating the perception, control, and action systems in a manner similar to animals.

The main disadvantages of the architecture are:
*the difficulty of designing adaptable action selection through highly distributed system of inhibition and suppression; and
*the lack of large memory and symbolic representation, which seems to restrict the architecture from understanding language;

When subsumption architecture was developed, the novel setup and approach of subsumption architecture allowed it to be successful in many important domains where traditional AI had failed, namely real-time interaction with a dynamic environment. The lack of large memory storage, symbolic representations, and central control, however, places it at a disadvantage at learning complex actions, in-depth mapping, and understanding language.

<text>Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island is a 1995 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The player controls Yoshi, a friendly dinosaur, on a quest to reunite baby Mario with his brother Luigi, who has been kidnapped by Kamek. Yoshi runs and jumps to reach the end of the level while solving puzzles and collecting items with Mario&#x27;s help.

Following his introduction in the previous &quot;Super Mario&quot; game, &quot;Super Mario World&quot; (1990), Nintendo decided to develop a game starring Yoshi, with the aim of making it more accessible. &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; introduced his signature flutter jump and egg-spawning abilities. The marker-drawn art style was created by scanning hand-drawn pictures and approximating them pixel-by-pixel. Some special effects were powered by a new Super FX2 microchip. 

After four years of development, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; was released in Japan in August 1995 and worldwide two months later. It sold more than four million copies. Critics described it as one of the greatest video games of all time, praising the art, sound, level design and gameplay. The art style and Yoshi&#x27;s signature characteristics established the &quot;Yoshi&quot; series of spin-offs and sequels. 

&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; was the last &quot;Super Mario&quot; platformer before the series&#x27; transition to 3D gameplay, with no further 2D entries for over a decade. It was ported to the Game Boy Advance as &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island: Super Mario Advance 3&quot; in 2002; this version was rereleased for the Nintendo 3DS and the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in the early 2010s. The original version was also released for the Super NES Classic Edition and Nintendo Switch Online in the late 2010s.

==Plot==
A long time ago, Kamek, a Magikoopa, attacks a stork delivering baby brothers Mario and Luigi. He succeeds in kidnapping Baby Luigi, but Baby Mario falls out of the sky and onto the back of Yoshi, the friendly dinosaur, on Yoshi&#x27;s Island. Yoshi and his friends relay Mario across the island to reach Luigi and rescue him from Kamek, who is in the service of the young Bowser. Bowser wanted to abduct the brothers when Kamek foresaw that they would foil his plans in the future. Yoshi defeats Bowser, saves Luigi, and the stork successfully delivers the brothers to their parents in the Mushroom Kingdom.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; is a 2D side-scrolling platform game. In the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series platform game tradition, the player controls Yoshi in run-and-jump gameplay. The player navigates between platforms and atop some foes en route to the end of the increasingly difficult levels. The player controls one of many Yoshis, which take turns traveling through 48 levels across six worlds to rescue Baby Luigi and reunite the brothers. Yoshi also collects coins to earn extra lives and retains his long tongue from &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. The game centers more on &quot;puzzle-solving and item-collecting&quot; than other platformers, with hidden flowers and red coins to find. Levels include mines, ski jumps, and &quot;the requisite fiery dungeons&quot;. Every fourth level (two in each world) is a boss fight against a large version of a previous foe.

In a style new to the series, the game has a coloring book aesthetic with &quot;scribbled crayon&quot; backgrounds. Expanding on his &quot;trademark tongue&quot; ability to swallow enemies, Yoshi, as the focus of the game, was given a new move set: the ability to &quot;flutter jump&quot;, throw eggs, and transform. The flutter jump gives Yoshi a secondary boost when the player holds the jump button. It became his new &quot;trademark move&quot;, similar to that of Luigi in &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;. Yoshi can also pound the ground from mid-air to bury objects or break through soft earth, and use his long tongue to grab enemies at a distance. Swallowed enemies can be spat as projectiles immediately or stored for later use as an egg. The player individually aims and fires the eggs at obstacles via a new targeting system. The eggs also bounce off of surfaces in the environment. Up to six eggs can be stored this way, and will trail behind the character. Yoshi can also eat certain items for power-up abilities. For instance, watermelons let Yoshi shoot seeds from his mouth like a machine gun, and fire enemies turn his mouth into a flamethrower. Other power-ups transform Yoshi into vehicles including cars, drills, helicopters, and submarines. A star power-up makes Baby Mario invulnerable and extra fast.

While Yoshi is &quot;virtually invincible&quot;, if hit by an enemy, Baby Mario will float off his back in a bubble while a timer counts down to zero. When the timer expires, Koopas arrive to take Baby Mario and Yoshi loses a life. The player can replenish the timer by collecting small stars and power-ups. However, Yoshi can also lose a life instantly if he comes into contact with obstacles such as pits, spikes, lava, and thorns. Similar to &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, the player can hold a power-up in reserve, such as a &quot;+10 star&quot; (which adds ten seconds to the Baby Mario timer) or a &quot;magnifying glass&quot; (which reveals all hidden red coins in a level). These power-ups are acquired in several minigames. At the end of each level, the Yoshi relays Baby Mario to the successive Yoshi. If the player perfects all eight levels in each world by finishing with all flowers, red coins, and full 30 seconds on the timer, two hidden levels will unlock. There are three save slots on the cartridge.

The SNES version includes hidden 2-player minigames that can be accessed via a button combination. The Game Boy Advance version adds an exclusive bonus level for each world with 100% level completion. It also includes four-player support via link cable, but only to play &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, a pack-in feature also included on the other &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; games.

==Development==
Following his introduction in &quot;Super Mario World&quot; (1990), the character of Yoshi gained popularity and starred in puzzle game spin-offs such as &quot;Yoshi&quot; and &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot;. &quot;Mario&quot; creator Shigeru Miyamoto asked Yoshi&#x27;s designer, Shigefumi Hino, to develop an original project. Hino felt that the &quot;Mario&quot; team had already explored every possible avenue with 2D &quot;Mario&quot; platformers (Miyamoto would soon begin work on the 3D &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;). After brainstorming, he landed on the idea of using Yoshi as the main character of a platform game, with the goal of being more accessible than previous &quot;Mario&quot; games. According to Hino, the developers then decided that Yoshi&#x27;s goal in the game should be to carry Mario across the world map. The team originally chose to feature infant Mario as a justification for him not being able to walk independently.

To give the gameplay a more &quot;gentle and relaxed pacing&quot;, the levels lack time limits and feature more exploration elements than previous games; Yoshi&#x27;s flutter jump also makes him easier to control in the air than Mario. Yoshi&#x27;s ability to lay and throw eggs was added to distinguish &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; further from previous &quot;Mario&quot; games, none of which had prominently featured a throwing mechanic. Progression between levels was made linear so that players would improve their skills by replaying levels, as opposed to letting players avoid difficult levels on a world map.

In 2020, a prototype for a platform game with similar graphics to &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; was discovered, featuring a new protagonist wearing a pilot suit. The name, &quot;Super Donkey&quot;, suggests it may have been considered as a new &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game before being repurposed for Yoshi.
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; was developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) as part of the core &quot;Super Mario&quot; series. Production of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; began on February 1, 1992, and concluded on June 29, 1995. Development was spearheaded by Hino, Takashi Tezuka, Hideki Konno and Toshihiko Nakago. It was Nakago&#x27;s only directing role after an 11-year apprenticeship, with Miyamoto as producer. Newly hired artist Hisashi Nogami created the unique marker-drawn style. The graphics were achieved by drawing them by hand, digitally scanning them, and then approximating them pixel-by-pixel. Yoshiaki Koizumi animated the opening and ending, while series composer Koji Kondo wrote the game&#x27;s music.

Partway into the development of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; was released, which resulted in its computer-generated graphics becoming the norm for contemporary SNES games. It was too late for the graphic designers to incorporate such a style into &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;; instead, they pushed the hand-drawn style further as a way to &quot;fight back&quot;. As a compromise, the introductory and ending cutscenes feature a pre-rendered style, contrasting with the rest of the game. According to Miyamoto, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; was in development for four years, which let the team add &quot;lots of magic tricks&quot;. The game cartridge used an extra microchip to support the game&#x27;s rotation, scaling and other sprite-changing special effects. &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; was designed to use the Super FX chip, but when Nintendo stopped supporting the chip, the game became the first to use Argonaut Games&#x27;s Super FX2 microchip. Examples of chip-powered effects include 3D walls falling into the background, objects that are able to dynamically rotate and change size, and a psychedelic undulating effect when Yoshi touches floating fungi.

==Release==
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; was released first in Japan in August 1995, and two months later in North America and Europe. In advertising, Nintendo referred to some of the visual effects made possible by the Super FX2 chip as &quot;Morphmation&quot;. At the time of release, the SNES was in its twilight as a console in anticipation of the Nintendo 64, to be released the following year.

&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; was ported to the Game Boy Advance as &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island: Super Mario Advance 3&quot; in North America on September 23, 2002. In the game&#x27;s preview at E3 2002, &quot;IGN&quot; named &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; &quot;Best Platformer&quot; on a handheld console. The Game Boy Advance version is a direct port of the original, apart from implementing Kazumi Totaka&#x27;s voice as Yoshi and adding six additional levels. The visible area was also reduced to fit the handheld&#x27;s smaller screen. The new cartridge did not need an extra microchip to support the original&#x27;s special effects.

The Game Boy Advance version was rereleased for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U via Nintendo&#x27;s digital Virtual Console platform. The rerelease retains the cropped screen of the handheld version and the pack-in &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; game, though the multiplayer is disabled. The 3DS version was released on December 16, 2011, as an exclusive reward for early adopters of the Nintendo 3DS. It did not receive a wider release. The &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; rerelease for the Wii U was released worldwide on April 24, 2014. At E3 2010, Nintendo demoed &quot;classic&quot; 2D games such as &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; as remastered 3D games with a &quot;pop-up book feel&quot;. The SNES version was included as a part of the Super NES Classic Edition micro-console in 2017, and is also available in the SNES online app for the Nintendo Switch as part of the paid online service.

==Reception==
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; sold over copies in Japan by late 1995, and went on to sell . It has sold over four million copies worldwide, selling copies for the SNES.

&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; received critical acclaim. At the time of its 1995 release, Matt Taylor of &quot;Diehard GameFan&quot; thought &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; could be &quot;possibly the best platform game of all time&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; also said that the game was &quot;one of the biggest, most beautiful games ever made&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; was also most impressed by the game&#x27;s &quot;size and playability&quot;. &quot;Diehard GameFan&quot; three reviewers gave the game a near-perfect score. To wit, Nicholas Dean Des Barres said it was &quot;one of the handful of truly perfect games ever produced&quot;, and lamented that the magazine had given &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, which he felt was a lackluster game in comparison, the extra single point for a perfect score. Casey Loe removed that one point for Baby Mario&#x27;s &quot;annoying screech&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; also found Baby Mario&#x27;s crying sounds annoying. Reviewing the SNES release over a decade later, Kaes Delgrego of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; said the crying and some easy boss battles, while both minor, were the only shortcomings. Delgrego credited &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; with perfecting the genre, calling it &quot;perhaps the greatest platformer of all time&quot;.

Both contemporary and retrospective reviewers praised the art, level design, and gameplay, which became legacies of the game. Some called it &quot;charm&quot;. Delgrego of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; would stop mid-game just to watch what enemies would do. Martin Watts of the same publication called it &quot;an absolute pleasure on the eyes and unlike any other SNES game&quot;. Others praised the control scheme, technical effects, and sound design. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; Delgrego felt &quot;goosebumps and tingles&quot; during the ending theme, and marked the soundtrack&#x27;s range from the lighthearted intro to the &quot;epic grandeur of the final boss battle&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; writer Major Mike noted, &quot;[Yoshi&#x27;s Island] doesn&#x27;t rely on flashy graphics or jazzy effects to cover an empty game. This is one of the last of a dying breed: a 16-bit game that shows real heart and creativity.&quot;

&quot;Edge&quot; praised the game&#x27;s balance of challenge and accessibility. The magazine thought that the new power-ups of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; gave its gameplay and level design great range, and that the powers were significant additions to the series on par with the suits of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; or Yoshi&#x27;s own debut in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. &quot;Diehard GameFan&quot; Taylor wrote that there was enough gameplay innovation to make him cry and listed his favorites as the Baby Mario cape invincibility power-up, the machine gun-style seed spitting, and the snowball hill level. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; Watts called the egg stockpiling system &quot;clever&quot; for the way it encourages experimentation with the environment. &quot;Edge&quot; thought of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; as a &quot;fusion of technology and creativity, each enhancing the other&quot;. The magazine considered the game&#x27;s special effects expertly integrated into the gameplay, and described the developer&#x27;s handicraft as having an &quot;attention to detail that few games can match&quot;.

The Game Boy Advance version received similar praise. Reviewing the Game Boy Advance release in 2002, Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; was &quot;the best damn platformer ever developed&quot;. While acknowledging the game&#x27;s roots in the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, he said the game created enough gameplay ideas to constitute its own franchise. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Lucas M. Thomas wrote that the game&#x27;s story was also interesting as the origin story for the Mario brothers. Harris felt that the FX2 sprite-changing effects gave the game &quot;life&quot; and that the Game Boy Advance cartridge could handle the effects just as well. He added that Yoshi&#x27;s morphing abilities and sound effects were designed well. Levi Buchanan of &quot;IGN&quot; said the game struck the right balance of tutorial by trial and error. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Harris also noted a few Game Boy Advance-specific issues: framerate drop in areas where a lot is happening onscreen, camera panning problems due to the screen&#x27;s lower resolution, and a &quot;poor&quot; implementation of the &quot;dizzy&quot; special effect on the handheld release. Critics wrote that the &quot;coloring book&quot;-style graphics held up well. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Harris felt it was the best of the &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; games. Of the similar version for the Wii U, Watts of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; also noticed the framerate issues and problems resulting from the screen&#x27;s closer crop, which were &quot;not enough to ruin the game, but ... noticeable&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; felt that game&#x27;s only disappointment was the linearity of its overworld following the exploratory &quot;Super Mario World&quot; and that the sequel would &quot;inevitably ... have less impact&quot;. It won for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Graphics on Game Boy Advance&quot; award. During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, it received a nomination for &quot;Handheld Game of the Year&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.

==Legacy==
Retrospective reviews by &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;NintendoLife&quot; declared &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; recalled it as &quot;one of the most loved SNES adventures of all time&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Lucas M. Thomas wrote it marked where Yoshi &quot;came into his own&quot; and developed many of his definitive characteristics: the &quot;signature&quot; flutter jump, and ability to throw eggs and transform shape. Baby Mario, who debuted in the game, featured in a number of sports-related games. The Nintendo producer Takashi Tezuka maintained the &quot;handicraft feel&quot; in later &quot;Yoshi&quot; games, which later included yarn and similar variations. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; called the art style &quot;a bold step ... that paid off handsomely&quot;. Delgrego of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; wrote that the game marked a new era of art in video games that prioritized creativity over graphics technology.

Delgrego continued that the countdown-based life was a &quot;revolutionary&quot; mechanic that became ubiquitous in games like the &quot;Halo&quot; series. Martin Watts also of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; considered &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; to be a more momentous event in gaming history, but felt that &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; was the &quot;most significant&quot; event in the &quot;&quot;Mario Bros.&quot; timeline&quot;. In a retrospective, &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that SNES owners embraced the game alongside &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Jared Petty wrote that &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; bested &quot;the test of time far better than many of its contemporaries&quot;. Levi Buchanan of &quot;IGN&quot; thought Nintendo took a risk with &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; by making Mario passive and giving Yoshi new abilities. Christian Donlan of &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot; wrote that the game was a testament to the Mario team&#x27;s &quot;staggering confidence&quot; in its development ability. He said the game was &quot;perhaps the most imaginative platformer&quot; of its time. In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked it the 7th best console game of all time, saying it &quot;is as much a piece of art as a game&quot; and &quot;is the epitome of platform gaming, falling only inches behind &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; as the best 2-D platformer of all time.&quot; &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; ranked 22nd on &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; 2009 top 100 Nintendo games as a &quot;bone fide classic&quot;, 15th on &quot;IGN&quot;″s 2014 top 125 Nintendo games of all time, and second on &quot;USgamer&quot;″s 2015 best &quot;Mario&quot; platformers list. In 2018, &quot;Complex&quot; listed the game 14th on its &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked Yoshi&#x27;s Island number 1 on their &quot;The &quot;GamesMaster&quot; SNES Top 10.&quot; In the same issue, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; rated the game 45th in its &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot;

In July 2020, a large amount of Nintendo data was leaked, including &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; source data and several prototypes. A track based on the game was released for &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;″s Booster Course Pass on March 9, 2023 and for &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot; the following month.

===Sequels and spin-offs===
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; led to a strong year for Yoshi as a character. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Thomas wrote that the hand-drawn style of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; made the computer-generated &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; appear outdated, though both games sold well. Rareware included a Yoshi cameo in &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;, released that year. &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; graphics and characters were also incorporated into the 1996 SNES puzzle game &quot;Tetris Attack&quot;.

Following &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; success, Nintendo developed &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot;, a 1998 platformer for the Nintendo 64. It was highly anticipated but received weaker reviews, with fetch quests and the 3D style Miyamoto eschewed in its predecessor. It expanded on Yoshi&#x27;s character voice as introduced in &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, but also &quot;dumbed down Yoshi&#x27;s character&quot;. In 2004, Nintendo released the tilt sensor-controlled &quot;Yoshi Topsy Turvy&quot; for Game Boy Advance, which was developed by Artoon and received mixed reviews. The Nintendo-developed minigame &quot;Yoshi Touch &amp; Go&quot; was released in 2005 for Nintendo DS. 

In 2006, Nintendo published &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island DS&quot;, also developed by Artoon. Titled &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island 2&quot; until just before it shipped, it retained the core concept of transporting baby Nintendo characters, and added the babies Princess Peach, Bowser, and Donkey Kong, each with a special ability. Yoshi had a similar moveset to &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; and added dash and float abilities, but was more passive a character compared to the babies on his back. It received generally positive reviews. It was given high scores by &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot;, who gave it 8/10 and 9.1/10 respectively. &quot;GameSpot&quot; commented that the developers have &quot;produced a sequel that seems fresh and new while remaining every bit as awesome as the original&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot; called it &quot;a solid recreation of the &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; elements in a two-screen-high format&quot;. In 2014, Nintendo released &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s New Island&quot; for Nintendo 3DS. It was developed by former Artoon employees at their new company, Arzest. As in the original, Yoshi carries Baby Mario and throws eggs, and can now swallow large foes, which become large eggs that can destroy large obstacles. It received mixed reviews, with criticism for its graphics, art-style, soundtrack and similarity to the SNES original; though the level design and overall charm did attract some praise.

In &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot; (2010), Christian Donlan wrote that despite the &quot;streamlined&quot; &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; and &quot;brilliant&quot; &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Touch and Go&quot;, &quot;the original was never bettered and never truly advanced upon&quot;. In &quot;Eurogamer&quot; 2015 preview of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Woolly World&quot;, Tom Phillips wrote that it had &quot;been 20 years since the last truly great &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;. &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Woolly World&quot; received higher review scores than &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s New Island&quot; but worse than &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island DS&quot; and the original game, with reviewers praising the art style, gameplay, and innovation, but critiquing the easy difficulty. The next &quot;Mario&quot; 2D side-scroller, &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot;, was released in 2006.

<text>Yoshi&#x27;s Story is a 1997 platform game published and developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was released in Japan in December 1997, and worldwide the following year. The game has been subsequently re-released on the Wii, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch.

Development was handled by Nintendo EAD and led by Hideki Konno and Takashi Tezuka. It was the first &quot;Yoshi&quot; platformer not to be produced nor directed by Shigeru Miyamoto, although he contributed design ideas and acted as supervisor for the game. The score was composed by Kazumi Totaka, who provided the voice of Yoshi in the game. As a follow-up to the Super NES game &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, it continues within the platform genre with similar gameplay. However, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; is more puzzle-oriented, with most challenges being tied to the strategic achievement of a high score. Taking place within a pop-up storybook, the game features vivid pre-rendered 3D graphics, illustrating worlds that are crafted from different materials, such as cardboard, fabrics, plastic, and wood. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who responded unfavorably to its low difficulty level, although its art style, audio, and graphics were praised.

==Gameplay==
 The player may choose between two different game modes from the game&#x27;s main menu: Story Mode and Trial Mode. Upon entering either mode, the player can select a course, find out which fruit will be the Lucky Fruit, and choose a Yoshi of desired color to play as. Trial Mode is devoid of courses to play at the start of the game, as these have to be unlocked by completing them in Story Mode.

On each course, the goal is to fill the Fruit Frame by eating 30 pieces of fruit. These may be found in abundance throughout every course, lying around, floating in bubbles, and carried by some enemies. The puzzle element of the game encourages the player to apply strategy to achieve a high score. For instance, the player gains more points from eating one kind of a fruit in a row, and even more so if the fruit is a Favorite Fruit or a Lucky Fruit. Melons give the most points, and each level has exactly 30 of them hidden throughout. In addition, valuable secrets are hidden throughout every course that will contribute to the total score.

The courses are spread across six pages, containing four courses each. The courses are sorted by difficulty, and the choice of which course to play is made individually for each page. While the first page will always display four courses, the following pages will initially be limited to only one course. In order to unlock the remaining courses, the player must seek out and collect Special Hearts. Each course has three collectable hearts, and the number of hearts collected determines the number of additional courses that are unlocked on the following page. For example, if the player collects two hearts during a course, they will be allowed to choose from course 1, 2, and 3 on the next page.

The abilities of Yoshis include running, ducking, jumping, ground pounding, temporary hovering, and hurling eggs. Eggs no longer ricochet off walls and the ground, and Yoshis no longer have the option of spitting out enemies, which are turned into eggs as soon as they are swallowed. Two Yoshi colors are unlockable within the game, White Yoshi and Black Yoshi. If both are found, they give two extra lives.

==Plot==
Living together in harmony at Yoshi Island, the Yoshis are able to maintain a perpetual state of joy through the fruit-bearing Super Happy Tree. Baby Bowser becomes envious of this happiness and casts a spell to transform the island into a pop-up storybook. He steals the Super Happy Tree, further weakening the Yoshis and making them fall to gloom.

Six eggs were able to survive the trial and hatch. Confused about the dismal state of their world, the baby Yoshis know that something is amiss and decide to fight the gloom with cheer. They set out to retrieve the Super Happy Tree and restore happiness to the island.

On their way to Baby Bowser&#x27;s castle, the Yoshis must progress through the six pages of the storybook, encountering six different areas of the island. While each page consists of four courses each, the path to Baby Bowser&#x27;s castle will only consist of one course per page. After progressing to the castle and completing one of the final courses, the Yoshi in play will face Baby Bowser in a final showdown. Following his defeat, a final narration will convey the story from each of the six pages and courses the Yoshis went through, ending with the Yoshis standing together in joy, encircling the Super Happy Tree. But if one gets knocked out, a cutscene shows Kamek&#x27;s minions kidnapping Yoshi, removing that Yoshi from the game.

==Development==
Originally titled &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island 64&quot; for the 64DD floppy drive and then moved to cartridge instead, the game was developed by the &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; team, directed by Hideki Konno and produced by Takashi Tezuka. With the first promotional video clip from the game being revealed at Nintendo Space World in November 1996, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island 64&quot; presented lush, colorful worlds of pre-rendered 3D graphics and polygonal animations, also demonstrating the Nintendo 64&#x27;s ability to run 2D games. Shigeru Miyamoto said the 2D format was necessary to create the artistic style of graphics the development team wanted. Nintendo described the game as &quot;2.5D&quot;. The game&#x27;s title was eventually changed to &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot;, being announced in August 1997, with a release of promotional screenshots from upcoming games. Shortly after, the game was noted to be getting a memory expansion, extending from 96 to 128 megabits. The completed game was unveiled at Nintendo Space World in November 1997. 

With the game&#x27;s initial release hitting Japan on December 21, 1997, the international release was delayed from the fourth quarter of 1997 to February 9, 1998. Reviews from the press said the game was too easy and little rewarding. Nintendo of America would thus demand the difficulty bar of the game to be raised. With extra time to polish the game, several changes were made to the international release, including graphical cleanup; the addition of white fences on cardboard courses; Egg Blocks with colors matching the Yoshi in play; new locations for some items; a slightly different ending when the player finishes a course with only melons; and additional secrets, including hidden coin formations that spell out letters. Furthermore, the updated version also added a save feature to Story Mode, allowing the player to continue the game from the last page reached.

===Audio===
The game&#x27;s overall sound effects were designed by Hajime Wakai and the palette of vocal expressions for Yoshi were recorded by Kazumi Totaka. The recorded samples have since been constituting the official voice for Yoshi, making a second appearance in the 1999 game &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, to further be recycled in succeeding games that Yoshi appeared in. This trend was eventually interrupted in 2009 with the release of &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot;, which used the original Yoshi cry from &quot;Super Mario World&quot; in homage to that game.

Aside from providing the voice for Yoshi, Kazumi Totaka composed the music. The game features an interactive soundtrack, where the music will change dynamically. For example, if Yoshi is harmed to the point where the Smile Meter has no remaining petals, the music will sweep down to a lower pitch and tempo, reflecting his dreary mood. But if Yoshi eats a Heart Fruit and becomes Super Happy, the music will instantly switch to a rock version of the currently playing theme. Totaka has hidden his 19-note signature melody in the game, which may be heard on the Trial Mode course select screen, after the background music has looped eight times.

Prior to the game&#x27;s release, a promotional soundtrack was released in North America, titled &quot;Music to Pound the Ground To: Yoshi&#x27;s Story Game Soundtrack&quot;. Published by The Original Shape CD, Inc., the 15-track CD had the characteristic trait of being shaped to outline the print on the disc, illustrating Yoshi&#x27;s head. However, as an asymmetrically shaped CD, it raises compatibility issues with most non-portable CD players. The full soundtrack was released in Japan on February 4, 1998, published by Pony Canyon. The third and last issue of the soundtrack, &quot;Love, Peace &amp; Happiness: The Original Yoshi&#x27;s Story Soundtrack&quot;, contained 28 tracks, and was released in Germany by Nintendo of Europe on April 9, 1998.

===Game Boy Advance tech demo===
When Nintendo unveiled the Game Boy Advance to U.S. game developers on April 10, 2000, one of the available demonstrations was a tech demo derived from &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot;. It was specifically developed to show off the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s graphical capacity, featuring an opening demo and a single looping course. The opening displayed a pre-rendered rotating island, resembling the shape of a Yoshi, taking advantage of the system&#x27;s affine rotate-and-zoom feature (akin to the Super Nintendo&#x27;s Mode 7) to render a seascape in perspective. The demo&#x27;s level design was based on the colorful cardboard theme of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot;. However, the gameplay differed significantly from the original game. For instance, Yoshi was unable to use his tongue; nor could he throw eggs, in spite of being able to obtain them. Screenshots from the demo show the presence of giant Shy Guys, that were primarily designed to demonstrate system&#x27;s advancement from the Game Boy Color&#x27;s 10-pixel sprite limit. In spite of the fact that Nintendo had published a promotional image of a Game Boy Advance with the tech demo running on it, it was never released as a completed game. The tech demo has been salvaged and showcased its functionality as a game.

===Re-releases===
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; was re-released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service in October 2007, and for the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in early 2016. It was also re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in October 2021.

==Marketing and sales==
According to the Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot;, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; sold 53,428 copies on the day of its release in Japan. As a result, it gained the number seven rank in &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s top ten best-selling video games chart. The game sold an additional 118,502 copies in the region by January 4, 1998, dropping to the number eight spot. By the end of that year, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; sold a total of 618,789 copies in Japan, making it the 27th best-selling video game in the country in 1998. In the German market, it sold 150,000 units from January through September 1998. This made it the region&#x27;s sixth-best-selling console game of the period.

Nintendo intended to release &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; in North America by the 1997 holiday season, but the release was delayed until March 1998. A Nintendo official said that the delay was &quot;based on us demanding A-plus quality.&quot; Once the game was completed, Nintendo initially shipped 800,000 units from Japan to American retailers. Retailers were concerned that there would be shortages (like there had been for &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;), but a Nintendo official promised that the shipment would satisfy demand.

In an effort to promote the game in the U.S., Nintendo direct-mailed advertisements to recent console buyers; put advertisements in gaming and children&#x27;s magazines; and aired a 30-second television advertisement on NBC, Fox Kids, Kids&#x27; WB, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network during children&#x27;s programming. On March 7, 1998, Nintendo pre-launched the game in Lizard Lick, North Carolina; a town of 1,300 residents. The event featured tongue-themed contests for children, and video terminals that let people try out the game. While &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; was originally scheduled for a release by March 9, 1998, it was postponed due to El Niño storms. It was released the following day, on March 10, 1998.

An article in &quot;Financial Times&quot; said that the late release, an inadequate supply, and distribution errors had led to poor sales for &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; in the U.S. Within a month, the game was being discounted by more than 50%. Even so, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; became a Player&#x27;s Choice game on August 23, 1998. PC Data, which tracked sales in the United States, reported that the game sold 679,219 units and earned $32.6 million in revenues by the end of 1998. This made it the country&#x27;s eighth-best-selling Nintendo 64 release of the year. According to The NPD Group, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; was the 16th best selling video game in the U.S. in 1998.

==Reception==
&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; holds a 65 out of 100 rating on Metacritic based on eight reviews, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews&quot;. Upon its initial release, critics overwhelmingly praised the game&#x27;s music, ease of play, and graphics, particularly the seamless integration of rendered objects with hand-drawn art. However, they also overwhelmingly found the game to be simplistic, particularly as compared to its predecessor &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, and considered it much too short and easy to offer good value. John Ricciardi of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; wrote that &quot;Fans of the original &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; (one of the best platformers of all time) are going to be shaking their heads at the simplicity of this sequel.&quot;, and his co-reviewer Crispin Boyer said, &quot;Nintendo got nearly everything right – the control, graphics, music and sound effects are all brilliant. Now why aren&#x27;t there enough levels, bosses and secrets to keep me busy longer than a weekend?&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; likewise highlighted the game&#x27;s pre-rendered graphics for their variety of colors and scenery, but criticized the gameplay for being too easy and lacking challenge. Critics generally regarded the changes made to the international version to be positive but insufficient to alleviate the game&#x27;s brevity and feeble challenge.

Most reviews acknowledged that young children, who the game was clearly targeted towards, would probably love the game. Joe Fielder of &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted that &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; &quot;was obviously designed so that younger players could play through quickly and feel some sense of accomplishment&quot;, and called it &quot;good for a rental at best.&quot; Amongst the few more positive reviews, &quot;Game Informer&quot; praised its unusual art direction, unique progression system, and numerous hidden secrets. &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; could have been a renaissance for side-scrollers. Instead, it sounds more like a death knell.&quot;

&quot;GamePro&quot; considered the game&#x27;s amazing graphics to be its one universal appeal, stating that younger players would be enthralled with &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; but older players should avoid it. They also remarked that the analog control is overly sensitive and frustrating, and that the game should have had an option to use the N64 controller&#x27;s D-pad. Peer Schneider of &quot;IGN&quot;, by contrast, said that the analog control was the one gameplay element in which &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; made any advance over &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, praising its ease of use. He summed up his mixed feelings about the game: &quot;At its best, the level design is right up there with the original Mario games and it impresses with innovative control, great graphics and original levels. But at other times, Yoshi is an unchallenging romp through levels that reek of recycled game ideas, derivative layout, and clueless enemies.&quot;

On September 17, 2007, Nintendo made the initial release of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service. Reviews for the VC release were unenthusiastic. &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave the VC download a 4.0 out of 10, noting that &quot;Like many of the other Nintendo 64 games that have made the jump to the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; underwent a modest graphical upgrade that has replaced the formerly blurry textures with crisp objects and has significantly reduced the instances of slowdown during boss battles. The trade-off is that rumble support was dropped, just like the other N64 releases.&quot; As with their review of the original release, they lambasted the lack of interesting designs and challenge. In &quot;IGN&quot; editor Lucas M. Thomas&#x27;s review for the VC release, he gave it a 6.0 out of 10, saying that &quot;It&#x27;s nonsensical. And worse, unengaging.&quot; Repeating the criticisms of short length and lack of challenge from contemporary reviews, Thomas said that in retrospect &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot; was the beginning of Yoshi&#x27;s fall from favor, and that it stood up poorly against recent Yoshi games such as &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island DS&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; praised the game&#x27;s artistic style, commenting that &quot;The crisp 2D layout and colorful storybook vibe give it a timeless quality&quot;.

<text>Aretus (; Ancient Greek: Ἄρητος, &quot;Árētos&quot;) was one of several characters in Greek mythology:

*Aretus, son of Bias and Pero, and brother of Perialces and Alphesiboea, wife of King Pelias of Iolcus.
*King Aretus of Pylos, son of Nestor and Eurydice (or Anaxibia). He was the brother to Thrasymedes, Pisidice, Polycaste, Perseus, Stratichus, Peisistratus, Echephron and Antilochus.
*Aretus, armed his force under compulsion and joined King Deriades of India against Dionysus in the Indian War. His sons were dumb because while he was sacrificing to Aphrodite the day of his marriage, a pregnant sow gave birth to a bastard brood of marine creatures. A seer was asked and he foretold a succession of dumb children to come, like the voiceless generation of the sea. After the war Dionysus restored their voices. His sons, whom he had by Laobie, were Lycus, Myrsus, Glaucus, Periphas and Melaneus.
*Aretus, a warrior in the army of Dionysus during the Indian War. He was killed by King Deriades of India.
*Aretus, prince of Troy and one of fifty sons of Priam. He was killed by Automedon. Aretus was known for his love of horses and was said to be the protector of horses by the Greek people. Cavalry soldiers were often known to pray to Aretus and Allamenium before going into battle. In another account, Aretus and his brother Echemmon were instead slain by Odysseus.
*Aretus, a Bebrycian who helped to bind gauntlets about the hands of Amycus for his boxing-match. He was later killed by Clytius, one of the Argonauts.

<text>In Greek mythology, Argia or Argea (Ancient Greek: Ἀργεία &quot;Argeia&quot;) was a daughter of King Adrastus of Argos, and of Amphithea, daughter of Pronax. She was married to Polynices, the exiled king of Thebes, and bore him three sons: Thersander, Adrastus, and Timeas.

== Mythology ==

When Oedipus had died at Thebes, Argia came with others to the funeral of Oedipus, her father-in-law.

== Middle Age tradition ==
She is remembered in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, she is found in Limbo.

*Hyginus, who in his &quot;Fabulae&quot; (Latin) calls her Argia.

<doc id="83562" wikidata="Q822016" url="?curid=83562" title="New Jersey Route 21">
<text>Route 21 is a state highway in Northern New Jersey, running from the Newark Airport Interchange with US 1-9 and US 22 in Newark, Essex County to an interchange with US 46 in Clifton, Passaic County. The route is a four- to six-lane divided highway known as McCarter Highway on its southern portion in Newark that serves as a connector between the Newark and Paterson areas, following the west bank of the Passaic River for much of its length. It also serves as the main north–south highway through the central part of Newark, connecting attractions in Downtown Newark with Newark Airport. The portion of Route 21 through Newark is a surface arterial that runs alongside the elevated Northeast Corridor rail line through the southern part of the city and continues north through Downtown Newark while the portion north of Downtown Newark is a freeway. Route 21 intersects many major roads including I-78, Route 27, and I-280 in Newark, Route 7 in Belleville, and Route 3 in Clifton.

Route 21 was created in 1927 to run from Newark to Belleville. In 1948, the route was extended north to Paterson. In the 1950s construction began on the freeway portion of Route 21 and it was completed in stages between Chester Avenue in Newark and Monroe Street in Passaic between 1958 and 1973. Plans were made to extend the freeway north to I-80 in Elmwood Park; however, they were opposed by residents living on the east side of the Passaic River. In the 1980s, another northern extension of the Route 21 freeway was proposed to US 46 in Clifton; this section was built between 1997 and 2000. The surface portion of Route 21 through Newark underwent many improvements in the 1990s and 2000s.

==Route description==
Route 21 heads north from the Newark Airport Interchange with US 1/9 in Newark near Newark Airport on a six-lane freeway known as McCarter Highway. This portion of Route 21 serves to connect Newark Liberty with downtown Newark. The route interchanges with I-78 and US 22 and then crosses over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Greenville Running Track, Lehigh Line, and Passaic and Harsimus Line and then Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor rail line on a viaduct, coming to an interchange with Broad Street that provides access to Frelinghuysen Avenue (Route 27). The route continues north, paralleling the elevated Northeast Corridor tracks that lead up to Newark Penn Station, which serves Amtrak and NJ Transit trains. At the intersection with Emmet Street, Route 21 becomes a four-lane surface road and intersects with Murray Street, which provides access to the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark. This section of Route 21 through the southern part of Newark has a high accident rate due to the heavy concentration of businesses and traffic lights along this portion of road. The road widens to six lanes and the route intersects with Market Street (CR 510) near Newark Penn Station and continues north into Downtown Newark, splitting from the Northeast Corridor rail line. It crosses the intersection with Raymond Boulevard and the route meets the intersection with Center Street (CR 508), which it forms a concurrency.
Route 21 and CR 508 head along the west bank of the Passaic River, passing by the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. CR 508 splits from Route 21 by heading east on Bridge Street, crossing the Passaic River, and Route 21 continues north, passing by the former site of Bears &amp; Eagles Riverfront Stadium. After passing under NJ Transit&#x27;s Montclair-Boonton Line/Morris &amp; Essex Lines and interchanging with I-280, the route intersects with Clay Street (CR 506 Spur). Past the intersection with 3rd Avenue, Route 21 becomes a six-lane freeway again. After about a quarter mile, the northbound side swings under the southbound side and the freeway becomes double-decker, passes by Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, and returns to single-decker configuration. It then interchanges with Chester Avenue and Riverside Avenue with a southbound exit and northbound entrance before passing over Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Newark Industrial Track line. Route 21 comes to a northbound exit and southbound entrance for Grafton Avenue and Mill Street; this interchange actually connects with the original McCarter Highway, a street that retains this name and acts as a service road to Route 21 for a few blocks in this area, near several industries. Route 21 briefly becomes a double-decker freeway again past the latter interchange and passes under Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Boonton Line, before crossing into Belleville at the Second River crossing. The freeway features a southbound exit for Mill Street and a northbound exit for Rutgers Street/Belleville Turnpike (Route 7 and CR 506) as it passes by houses on the left side of the freeway. Route 21 features an interchange with Main Street that has a southbound exit and an entrance in both directions. It enters Nutley where the freeway interchanges with County Route 646 (Park Avenue), continuing north through residential areas along the Passaic River.

As Route 21 crosses into Clifton, Passaic County, it passes under NJ Transit&#x27;s Main Line and comes to an interchange with Route 3. North of this point, the freeway comes to a northbound exit and southbound entrance for southbound River Road (CR 624), passing through residential neighborhoods, and enters Passaic. In Passaic, Route 21 interchanges with Brook Avenue (CR 608), Van Houten Avenue (CR 614), and River Drive (CR 624). The route features an interchange with River Drive (CR 624) and Main Avenue (CR 601) and meets State Street at a partial interchange with a northbound exit and southbound entrance. This interchange provides access to the Union Avenue Bridge over the Passaic. Route 21 heads farther to the west of the Passaic River, passing through industrial and residential areas of Passaic. The freeway briefly enters Wallington and comes to an interchange that provides access to Market Street (CR 619), Dayton Avenue, and Monroe Street. Route 21 continues to the north and resumes along the west bank of the Passaic River, narrowing to four lanes and crossing back into Clifton. Upon entering Clifton, the route comes to an interchange with Ackerman Avenue. The freeway heads to the northwest, passing by a park and featuring a southbound exit and northbound entrance for Lexington Avenue before ending at an interchange with US 46.

==History==
Route 21 history starts in 1927 with the New Jersey highway renumbering plan. At that time it was set up as a surface roadway running through Newark and Belleville, with at-grade interchanges with local streets. This surface road eventually extended to Paterson.

From the late 1950s through the early 1970s, much of the highway north of Newark was rebuilt as a limited-interchange freeway., through most of its portion in the City of Passaic. The remaining portion through downtown Passaic and the Botany Village portion of Clifton was not constructed until the last four years of the 20th century.

Further improvements to the remaining surface portion were made to the Newark portion, though most of it remains as city streets.

=== Original surface road ===
Route 21 was first defined in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering to run from Route 25 (now US 1/9) and Route 29 (now US 22) in Newark north to Belleville. The surface portion of Route 21 in Newark, which follows the Northeast Corridor rail line, was commissioned in 1934 between Routes 25 and 29 and Market Street and the portion through downtown Newark was commissioned in 1936 between Market Street and Clay Street. Route 19 was designated in 1939 from Paterson to Belleville. In 1948, the Route 21 designation was extended north to Paterson, replacing Route 19 (which has since been reassigned elsewhere).

By Joint Resolution No. 4, approved March 22, 1934, the New Jersey Legislature designated Route 21 as the McCarter Highway, in memory of Newark financier and philanthropist Uzal Haggerty McCarter.

=== Freeway ===
Plans for a freeway along the Route 21 corridor between Newark and Paterson date back to the early 1930s and became official in 1951. In 1958, the highway was extended northward as a freeway along the west bank of the Passaic River to an interchange with Park Avenue in Nutley. Route 21 was extended to the Passaic Park interchange in 1962, Main Avenue in 1968, and Monroe Street in 1973. 1970s legislation stopped the further extension northward until environmental impact could be assessed, leaving a two-mile city street portion in place to connect to Routes 20, 46, and I-80 in Paterson for over 25 years.

With the completion of the freeway to Monroe Street, a portion of the former route was briefly known as Route 21A.
According to the original freeway plans, the portion north of Monroe Street was to cross over the Passaic River and terminated in Elmwood Park at the interchange of I-80 and CR 507. This routing would have allowed the highway continue with six full lanes. However, the proposal was opposed by residents who lived on the east side of the Passaic River, and for a quarter-century, traffic headed for Paterson had to use local streets in Passaic.

In the 1980s, plans were resurrected for completing the Route 21 freeway along the west bank of the Passaic River to US 46 in Clifton, avoiding the earlier objections. Official plans were made in 1996, and in late 1997, construction began on this portion of the freeway. It opened on December 20, 2000 at a cost of $136 million. However, this new route was limited mostly to four lanes (three lanes at the very northern end), utilizing the right of way of the Dundee Canal. A wider highway would have encroached on private property or the Passaic River, entailing much greater costs.

=== Newark section improvements ===
Sections of Route 21 through Newark were improved in the 1990s and the 2000s. The four-lane viaduct over the Northeast Corridor, which was built in the 1920s, was replaced between 1997 and 2003 at a cost of $253 million. A major reconstruction occurred at the interchange with I-280 at the William A. Stickel Memorial Bridge in Newark from 2015 to 2018.

On April 27, 2018, the portion of Route 21 between mileposts 3.90 and 5.83 was dedicated the &quot;Roberto Clemente Memorial Highway&quot; after the late baseball legend Roberto Clemente, who wore number 21 for his entire career with the Pittsburgh Pirates.

<text>Route 34 is a state highway in the central part of the U.S. state of New Jersey. The route runs from an intersection of Route 35 and Route 70 (the former Brielle Circle) in Wall Township, Monmouth County, north to an interchange with US 9 in Old Bridge, Middlesex County. The route is a four-lane divided highway between its southern terminus and the north end of the Route 33 concurrency in Howell; along this stretch, the route interchanges with the Garden State Parkway and I-195/Route 138 within a short distance of each other. North of Route 33, Route 34 is an undivided two- to four-lane road that interchanges with Route 18 in Colts Neck and intersects with Route 79 in Matawan. Route 34 passes through mostly suburban areas along its route.

The route was legislated in 1927 to run from Route 35 (present Route 88) in Laurelton north to Route 4 (present Route 79) in Matawan. The current alignment of Route 34 north of Matawan was a part of Route 4 (and later US 9) until it became a part of Route 4A following a realignment of US 9 and Route 4. In 1953, Route 34 was extended north along Route 4A to end at US 9 in Old Bridge. Meanwhile, the southern terminus was cut back to its current location with the route south of that point becoming a part of Route 70. Since 1953, the southern portion of the route was widened into a divided highway and the Brielle Circle was replaced.

==Route description==

Route 34 begins at an intersection of Route 35 and Route 70 in Wall Township, Monmouth County, at the former Brielle Circle, heading to the northwest on a six-lane undivided road. A short distance past this intersection, the route becomes a four-lane divided highway that passes through suburban development with some woods. It passes over the Capital to Coast Trail and meets CR 524 Spur before reaching the Allenwood Circle, where Route 34 intersects with CR 524. Past the Allenwood Circle, the road continues northwest to a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway. This interchange has access to the northbound Garden State Parkway from northbound Route 34, to the southbound Garden State Parkway from southbound Route 34, and to both directions of Route 34 from the southbound Garden State Parkway. Immediately past this interchange, the road intersects with West 18th Avenue (CR 30) before coming to a cloverleaf interchange with I-195 and Route 138. Route 34 provides the missing movements between the southbound Garden State Parkway and I-195/Route 138. From here, the road passes through woodland before heading into commercial and industrial areas, where it passes by the Wall Stadium racetrack and the Monmouth Executive Airport. The route enters wooded residential and business areas where it intersects with Belmar Boulevard and Megill Road, which are both distinct segments of CR 18. Route 34 continues north before it intersects with Route 33 and CR 547 at the Collingwood Circle.
At the traffic circle, Route 34 turns northwest to run concurrently with Route 33 on a four-lane divided highway that passes businesses, crossing into Howell and passing over the Southern Secondary railroad line operated by the Delaware &amp; Raritan River Railroad. The two routes eventually split; Route 34 heads north on a two-lane undivided road. It passes through wooded areas of Naval Weapons Station Earle and enters Colts Neck. Upon leaving the grounds of Naval Weapons Station Earle, the route widens into a four-lane divided highway again and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 18. Past this interchange, Route 34 becomes a two-lane undivided road that passes development and Delicious Orchards before crossing the intersection of CR 537. From here, the road heads past suburban neighborhoods and farmland, intersecting with Phalanx Road (CR 54) before meeting the intersection of Conover Road (CR 4). Route 34 briefly runs concurrently with CR 4 until the county route heads northeast on South Street. The route continues into wooded areas of homes, crossing into Holmdel, where it intersects with Newman Springs Road/West Main Street (CR 520).
After this intersection, the road continues past homes and farms before turning northwest and entering Marlboro. Here, the road heads through wooded residential and commercial areas, briefly becoming a four-lane road, before it crosses into Aberdeen. In Aberdeen, Route 34 heads into business areas as it crosses the intersection of Lloyd Road (CR 3). The road becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, forming the border of Matawan to the west and Aberdeen to the east. Upon passing under the Henry Hudson Trail, the route entirely enters Matawan, continuing northwest as four-lane Middlesex Street. Here, Route 34 intersects with Broad Street (CR 516) and Route 79 and Main Street (CR 516 Spur). Following these intersections, the road heads into residential and business areas, crossing over Lake Lefferts.
Route 34 crosses into Old Bridge, Middlesex County, where it becomes a two-lane road, continuing through commercial areas. The route intersects with Morristown Road (CR 689) and Amboy Road (CR 645), where it turns to the west and passes through areas of residences and businesses and reaches the intersection of Cottrell Road (CR 687). At the intersection of Cottrell Road (CR 687), Route 34 turns to the north and intersects with Spring Hill Road. The road continues north and ends at a partial interchange with US 9, with access to northbound US 9 and access from southbound US 9. Missing movements between Route 34 and US 9 are provided by Perrine Road to the south.

==History==
The Holmdel and Middletown Point Turnpike was a turnpike chartered on February 28, 1862, and ran between Holmdel and Middletown Point (now Matawan). The road&#x27;s trajectory is now roughly followed by Route 34.

In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 34 was legislated to run from an intersection with Route 35 (now Route 88 in Laurelton, Ocean County, north to Route 4 (now Route 79) in Matawan, with the portion of current Route 34 north of that intersection legislated as part of Route 4. By the 1940s, US 9 was also designated along the present-day portion of Route 34 that was then a part of Route 4, this would later become Route 4A after US 9 and Route 4 were moved to a new alignment between Freehold and Cheesequake. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 34 was extended north along the alignment of Route 4A to end at US 9 in Cheesequake while the southern terminus was cut back to the Brielle Circle intersection with Route 35 and Route 70, the latter having replaced Route 34 south of this point. By 1969, Route 34 was widened into a divided highway as far north as Route 33. The Brielle Circle at the southern terminus of the route was converted into at-grade intersections with traffic lights in 2001.

<doc id="83565" wikidata="Q1455747" url="?curid=83565" title="Hippomenes">
<text>:&quot;The name Hippomenes may also refer to the father of Leimone.&quot;
In Greek mythology, Hippomenes (; ), also known as [[Melanion (mythology)|Melanion]] (; Μελανίων or Μειλανίων), was a son of the Arcadian Amphidamas or of King Megareus of Onchestus and the husband of Atalanta. He was known to have been one of the disciples of Chiron, and to have surpassed other disciples in his eagerness to undertake hard challenges. Inscriptions mention him as one of the Calydonian hunters.

== Mythology ==

The main myth of Hippomenes&#x27; courtship of Atalanta, narrated by Pseudo-Apollodorus, Ovid, Servius, and Hyginus was as follows.

Hippomenes fell in love with Atalanta, the virgin huntress who strongly disliked the idea of getting married. After a warning from an oracle about getting married, she declared that whoever wanted to marry her was to beat her in a footrace (herself being a notoriously swift runner), and that those who should try and lose would be punished by instant death.
Another version (followed by Hyginus) was that her father wanted her to be married, but she did not. She agreed to running races against her suitors because she thought she would never lose.

Atalanta raced all her suitors and outran all but Hippomenes, who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win a fair race with Atalanta, so he prayed to Aphrodite for help (the goddess, in the meantime, disliked Atalanta&#x27;s neglect of love).

Aphrodite gave him three golden apples – which came from her sacred apple-tree in Tamasus, Cyprus, according to Ovid, or from the garden of the Hesperides according to Servius – and told him to drop them one at a time to distract Atalanta. After each of the first two apples, Atalanta was able to recover the lead, but when she stopped for the third, Hippomenes won the race. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta&#x27;s hand.

Atalanta and Hippomenes were turned into lions by Cybele as punishment after having sex in one of her temples they entered to take a rest during their journey to Hippomenes&#x27; home (the Greeks believed that lions could not mate with other lions, but only with leopards). Ovid and Servius suggest that Hippomenes forgot to pay the tribute to Aphrodite he had promised for helping him, and consequently, during the two&#x27;s stay at Cybele&#x27;s temple, Aphrodite caused them to have sex after going mad with lust, knowing that this would offend Cybele, and this indeed resulted in Cybele (or Zeus according to Hyginus) transforming them into lions. Thereafter they drew Cybele&#x27;s chariot, which Servius equates with the Earth itself.

According to some accounts, Hippomenes (Melanion) was the father of Parthenopaeus; yet others stated Atalanta had her son by either Ares or Meleager prior to her marriage to Hippomenes.

<text>The Var (, ; ; ) is a river located in the southeast of France. It is long. Its drainage basin is .

The Var flows through the Alpes-Maritimes &quot;département&quot; for most of its length, with a short (~15 km or ~9 mi) stretch in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence département. It is a unique case in France of a river not flowing in the &quot;département&quot; named after it (see Var).

Until the beginning of the 19th century, the river had no bridges; it was the border between France and the County of Nice, then part of Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia.

== Name ==
The river name is attested in Latin as &quot;Vārus&quot; and in Ancient Greek as &quot;Ouãros&quot; (Οὐᾶρος). It stems from the Indo-European root *&quot;uōr&quot;- (earlier &quot;*uer-&quot;), meaning &#x27;water, river&#x27; (cf. Sanskrit &quot;vār&quot;, Old Norse &quot;vari&quot;).

== Hydrography ==
The Var rises near the Col de la Cayolle (2,326 m/7,631 ft) in the Maritime Alps and flows generally southeast to its outflow into the Mediterranean Sea between Nice and Saint-Laurent-du-Var. Its main tributaries are the Cians, the Tinée, the Vésubie, the Coulomp, the Estéron, the Tuébi, the Chalvagne, the Barlatte, the Bourdous and the Roudoule.

The Var flows through the following départements and towns: 
*Alpes-Maritimes: Guillaumes
*Alpes-de-Haute-Provence: Entrevaux
*Alpes-Maritimes: Puget-Théniers, Carros, Saint-Laurent-du-Var

<doc id="83568" wikidata="Q1065225" url="?curid=83568" title="Minyans">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Minyans or Minyae (Greek: Μινύες, &quot;Minyes&quot;) were a group of legendary people who were the inhabitants of the city Orchomenus in Boeotia, and who were also associated with Thessaly. They were named after their eponymous ancestor, Minyas.

In archaeology, the term &quot;Minyans&quot; has been applied to the Minyan ware excavated from Orchomenus, and is used to refer to an autochthonous group of Proto-Greek speakers inhabiting the Aegean region, though the degree to which the material culture in the prehistory of the area can be securely linked to the legendary people or language-based ethnicity has been subjected to debate and repeated revision.

John L. Caskey&#x27;s interpretation of his archaeological excavations conducted in the 1950s linked the ethno-linguistic &quot;Proto-Greeks&quot; to the bearers of the Minyan (or Middle Helladic) culture. More recent scholars have questioned or amended his dating and doubted the linking of material culture to linguistic ethnicity.

==Classical Greek uses of &quot;Minyans&quot;==

Greeks did not always clearly distinguish the Minyans from the Pelasgian cultures that had preceded them. Greek mythographers gave the Minyans an eponymous founder, Minyas, perhaps as legendary as Pelasgus (the founding father of the Pelasgians), which was a broader category of pre-Greek Aegean peoples. These Minyans were associated with Boeotian Orchomenus, as when Pausanias relates that &quot;Teos used to be inhabited by Minyans of Orchomenus, who came to it with Athamas&quot; and may have represented a ruling dynasty or a tribe later located in Boeotia.

Herodotus asserts several times that Pelasgians dwelt in the distant past with the Athenians in Attica, and that those Pelasgians driven from Attica in turn drove the Minyans out of Lemnos. The same historian also states that Minyans from Amyklai settled on the island of Thera in 800 BC.

Heracles, the hero whose exploits always celebrate the new Olympian order over the old traditions, came to Thebes, one of the ancient Mycenaean cities of Greece, and found that the Greeks were paying tribute of 100 cattle (a &quot;hecatomb&quot;) each year to Erginus, king of the Minyans. Heracles attacked a group of emissaries from the Minyans, and cut off their ears, noses, and hands. He then tied them around their necks and told them to take those for tribute to Erginus. Erginus made war on Thebes, but Heracles defeated the Minyans with his fellow Thebans after arming them with weapons that had been dedicated in temples. Erginus was killed and the Minyans were forced to pay double the previous tribute to the Thebans. Heracles was also credited with the burning of the palace at Orchomenus: &quot;Then appearing unawares before the city of the Orchomenians and slipping in at their gates he burned the palace of the Minyans and razed the city to the ground.&quot;

The Argonauts were sometimes referred to as &quot;Minyans&quot; because Jason&#x27;s mother came from that line, and several of his cousins joined in the adventure.

==Archaeology==
===Terminology===
Before World War II, archaeologists sometimes applied the term &quot;Minyans&quot; differently, to indicate the very first wave of Proto-Greek speakers in the 2nd millennium BCE, among the early Bronze Age cultures sometimes identified with the beginning of Middle Helladic culture. Gray &quot;Minyan ware&quot; is an archaeologist&#x27;s term for a particular style of Aegean pottery associated with the Middle Helladic period (ca. 2100–1550 BC). More recently, however, archaeologists and palaeontologists find the term &quot;Minyan&quot; to be questionable: &quot;To call the makers of Minyan ware themselves &#x27;Minyans&#x27; is reprehensible&quot;, remarked F. H. Stubbings. &quot;Deriving ethnic names from pottery styles is one of the most deplorable habits in archaeology,&quot; F. J. Tritsch asserted in 1974. &quot;We cheerfully speak of the &#x27;Minyans&#x27; when we mean a population that uses pottery we call &#x27;Minyan&#x27;,&quot; although he was mistaken in saying that the Greeks themselves never mention the &#x27;Minyans&#x27; as a tribe or as a people.

===Excavations===
When John L. Caskey of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens outlined the results of his excavations at Lerna from 1952 up until 1958, he stated that the hallmarks of Middle Helladic culture (i.e. Gray Minyan ware and the fast potter&#x27;s wheel) may have originated from Early Helladic III. Caskey also stated that Lerna (along with settlements at Tiryns, Asine in the Argolid, Agios Kosmas near Athens, and perhaps Corinth) was destroyed at the end of Early Helladic II. He suggested that the invaders of Early Helladic II settlements may have been Greeks speaking a prototype of the later Greek language. However, there is evidence of destruction at the end of the Early Helladic III period at Korakou (near Corinth) and Eutresis in Boeotia. Nevertheless, Caskey found the Middle Helladic people to be the direct ancestors of the Myceneans and later Greeks.

Although scholars today agree that the Mycenean Greeks descend from the &quot;Minyans&quot; of the Middle Helladic period, they question Caskey&#x27;s suggestion that (proto-Greek) Indo-European invaders destroyed Early Helladic II settlements throughout Greece. In fact, the layers of destruction Caskey found at Lerna and Tiryns were ultimately attributed to fire. Moreover, there are indications of Early Helladic II culture being directly succeeded by Early Helladic III culture. Overall, this indicates that the progenitors and founders of &quot;Minyan culture&quot; were an autochthonous group.

<text>Periander (; ; died c. 585 BC) was the second tyrant of the Cypselid dynasty that ruled over ancient Corinth. Periander&#x27;s rule brought about a prosperous time in Corinth&#x27;s history, as his administrative skill made Corinth one of the wealthiest city states in Greece. Several accounts state that Periander was a cruel and harsh ruler, but others claim that he was a fair and just king who worked to ensure that the distribution of wealth in Corinth was more or less even. He is often considered one of the Seven Sages of Greece, men of the 6th century BC who were renowned for centuries for their wisdom. (The other Sages were most often considered to be Thales, Solon, Cleobulus, Chilon, Bias and Pittacus.)

== Life ==

===Family===
Periander was the second tyrant of Corinth and the son of Cypselus, the founder of the Cypselid dynasty. Because of his father, he was called Cypselides (Κυψελίδης).
Cypselus’ wife was named Cratea. There were rumors that she and her son, Periander, slept together. Periander married Lyside (whom he often referred to as Melissa), daughter of Procles and Eristenea of Epidaurus. They had two sons: Cypselus, who was said to be weak-minded, and Lycophron, a man of intelligence. According to the book &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, Periander, in a fit of rage, kicked his wife or threw her down a set of stairs so hard that she was killed. Greek historian Herodotus has alluded to suggestions that Periander had defiled the corpse of his wife, employing a metaphor: &quot;Periander baked his bread in a cold oven&quot;. Grief for his mother and anger at his father drove Lycophron to take refuge in Corcyra. When Periander was much older and looking to have his successor at his side, he sent for Lycophron. When the people of Corcyra heard of this, they killed Lycophron rather than let him depart. The death of his son caused Periander to fall into a despondency that eventually led to his death. Periander was succeeded by his nephew, Psammetichus, who ruled for just three years and was the last of the Cypselid tyrants.

===Rule ===
Periander built Corinth into one of the major trading centers in Ancient Greece. He established colonies at Potidaea in Chalcidice and at Apollonia in Illyria, conquered Epidaurus, formed positive relationships with Miletus and Lydia, and annexed Corcyra, where his son lived much of his life. Periander is also credited with inventing a transport system, the Diolkos, across the Isthmus of Corinth. Tolls from goods entering Corinth&#x27;s port accounted for nearly all the government revenues, which Periander used to build temples and other public works, and to promote literature and arts. He had the poet Arion come from Lesbos to Corinth for an arts festival in the city. Periander held many festivals and built many buildings in the Doric style. The Corinthian style of pottery was developed by an artisan during his rule.

Periander&#x27;s style of leadership and politics was termed a &#x27;tyranny&#x27;. Tyrants favored the poor over the rich, sometimes confiscating landlord&#x27;s possessions and enacting laws that limited their privileges. They also started the construction of temples, ports and fortifications, and improved the drainage of the city and supply of water. Periander adopted measures that benefitted commerce.

Diogenes Laertius recounts a legend about his death, that he did not want others to know where he was buried. &quot;He ordered two young men to go out at night by a certain road which he pointed out to them; they were to kill the man they met and bury him. He afterwards ordered four more to go in pursuit of the two, kill them and bury them; again, he dispatched a larger number in pursuit of the four. Having taken these measures, he himself encountered the first pair and was slain.&quot;

==Writing and philosophy==
Periander was said to be a patron of literature, who both wrote and appreciated early philosophy. He is said to have written a didactic poem 2,000 lines long. In the &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, Diogenes Laërtius points out that writers disagree on who the Seven Sages are. It is posited that Periander tried to improve order in Corinth; although he appears on Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s list, his extreme measures and despotic gestures make him more suited to a list of famous tyrants than of wise men.

Diogenes Laertius recounts some adages by him: Tyrants who intend to be safe should make loyalty their bodyguard, not arms. Pleasures are transient, honours are immortal. Be moderate in prosperity, prudent in adversity. Be the same to your friends whether they are in prosperity or in adversity. Whatever agreement you make, stick to it. Correct not only the offenders but also those who are on the point of offending.

==Influences==

Periander is referenced by many contemporaries in relation to philosophy and leadership. Most commonly he is mentioned as one of the Seven Sages of Ancient Greece, a group of philosophers and rulers from early Greece, but some authors leave him out of the list. In &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, Diogenes Laertius, a philosopher of the 3rd century AD, lists Periander as one of these Seven Sages. Ausonius also refers to Periander as one of the Sages in his work &quot;The Masque of the Seven Sages&quot;.

Some scholars have argued that the ruler named Periander was a different person from the sage of the same name. Diogenes Laërtius writes that &quot;Sotion, and Heraclides, and Pamphila in the fifth book of her Commentaries say that there were two Perianders; the one a tyrant, and the other a wise man, and a native of Ambracia. Neanthes of Cyzicus makes the same assertion, adding, that the two men were cousins to one another. Aristotle says, that it was the Corinthian Periander who was the wise one; but Plato contradicts him.&quot;

<text>Route 35 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey, primarily traveling through the easternmost parts of Middlesex, Monmouth, and Ocean counties. It runs from the entrance to Island Beach State Park in Berkeley Township, Ocean County to an intersection with Lincoln Highway/St. Georges Avenue (Route 27) in Rahway, Union County. Between Seaside Park and Mantoloking, Route 35 follows the right-of-way of the former Pennsylvania Railroad along the Jersey Shore. The route heads through Point Pleasant Beach and crosses the Manasquan River on the Brielle Bridge, meeting Route 34 and Route 70 at the former Brielle Circle in Wall Township. From there, Route 35 heads north and intersects Route 138, an extension of Interstate 195 (I-195), continuing north through Monmouth County before crossing the Victory Bridge over the Raritan River into Perth Amboy, where the route continues north to Rahway.

Route 35 was designated in 1927 to run from Lakewood to South Amboy, from Lakewood to Belmar and from Eatontown to South Amboy. It was realigned onto its current alignment between Brielle and Belmar in 1929 and saw a northward extension along U.s. Route 9 (US 9) from South Amboy to Iselin in 1947. In 1953, Route 35 was realigned to run from Point Pleasant to Seaside Heights along a former part of Route 37, with Route 35 between Lakewood and Point Pleasant becoming Route 88. At the same time, Route 35 was removed from US 9 between South Amboy and Iselin and realigned to follow a former piece of Route 4 between South Amboy and Rahway. From the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, there were plans to build a freeway along the Route 35 corridor from Seaside Heights north into Monmouth County; the only portion that was built became part of Route 18. Route 35 was extended south to the Island Beach State Park entrance by the 1980s. Recent improvements to the route have removed many traffic circles and replaced the first cloverleaf interchange in the United States, built in 1929, at US 1/9 in Woodbridge with a partial cloverleaf interchange.

==Route description==

===Ocean County===
Route 35 begins at the entrance to Island Beach State Park in Berkeley Township, Ocean County at the southern tip of the Barnegat Peninsula. South of Seaside Park, Route 35 is Central Avenue as it is the only road while it travels along the shore of the Peninsula. It heads north, varying between a two-lane road to a four-lane divided highway with parking spaces in the median and bike lanes on the outside through residential areas of South Seaside Park. It briefly becomes an undivided highway before crossing into Seaside Park, where the route becomes four-lane, divided Central Avenue, which also has median parking spaces. Route 35 passes by residences in Seaside Park, with the median widening for the Seaside Park Police Department building at the intersection of 6th Avenue, and then the road widening to six lanes further north. Upon crossing the intersection of Decatur Avenue, the southbound lanes of Route 35 run one block to the west of the northbound lanes and then turns to the west, crossing into Seaside Heights, a beach resort that has a boardwalk and an amusement pier. In Seaside Heights, Route 35 turns north and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of Route 37 on the Seaside Heights/Berkeley Township border on the eastern shore of the Barnegat Bay. At this interchange, a ramp provides access from northbound Route 35 a short distance past the ramp from eastbound Route 37 to Seaside Heights, connecting to Sumner Avenue.
Past the Route 37 interchange, Route 35 continues north along Barnegat Bay, curving eastward and crossing into Toms River, where the route splits into a block-wide one-way pair with two lanes and a bike lane in each direction that heads north through residential and commercial Ortley Beach. After crossing into Lavallette a mile later, the northbound direction of Route 35 becomes Grand Central Avenue and the southbound direction of Route 35 becomes Anna O. Hawkins Boulevard. The route then crosses back into Toms River, passing through Dover Beaches North. When Route 35 enters Brick, the northbound direction becomes Ocean Avenue and the one-way pair between the opposing directions of Route 35 narrows as it passes oceanfront residences. Upon crossing into Mantoloking, Route 35 becomes a two-lane, undivided road and heads north along a narrow peninsula, intersecting with Herbert Street (County Route 528, CR 528) less than a mile later.

Route 35 continues north through Bay Head, where the bike lanes end and the road name becomes Main Avenue. It then enters Point Pleasant Beach, a beach resort with a boardwalk, where the route swings to the west and crosses NJ Transit&#x27;s North Jersey Coast Line. Southbound Route 35 intersects the eastern terminus of Route 88 before Route 35 turns north onto another one-way pair with two lanes in each direction—the northbound direction following Cincinnati Avenue and the southbound direction following Richmond Avenue. The one-way pair carries the route through the downtown area of Point Pleasant Beach, with the NJ Transit tracks parallel to the east. At the intersection of Arnold Avenue (CR 633), northbound Route 35 shifts slightly to the west and becomes Hawthorne Avenue, passing to the west of the Point Pleasant Beach Station serving the North Jersey Coast Line. The route becomes a two-way highway again after half a mile and becomes a four-lane divided highway after intersecting with Broadway (CR 635), almost immediately crossing a channel of the Manasquan River and entering Monmouth County.

===Monmouth County===

Route 35 crosses into Brielle, Monmouth County, immediately passing over the main channel of the Manasquan River on a drawbridge. Upon crossing into Brielle, the route heads further west from the railroad tracks and intersects Ashley Avenue and the southern terminus of Route 71. The route continues northwest and crosses into Wall Township and meets the intersection of Route 34 and Route 70 at the former Brielle Circle, now an at-grade intersection with jughandles. Past this intersection, Route 35 heads north on a two-lane, undivided road that passes by many businesses. It meets the intersection of Atlantic Avenue (CR 524 Spur) at the Manasquan Circle, where the Circle Factory Outlet Center is located. Past the Manasquan Circle, Route 35 heads north as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that intersects with Allaire Road (CR 524). Route 35 widens to a four-lane divided highway and intersects the eastern terminus of Route 138, which continues west to become I-195. Route 35 curves to the east and crosses into Belmar where it becomes River Road. Here, the route runs along the south bank of the Shark River as a four-lane undivided highway, intersecting with H Street, where Route 71 heads to the south and running concurrently with that route. The two routes continue north along a divided highway until the intersection with 8th Avenue, where Route 71 heads to the east. Past this intersection, Route 35 becomes a four-lane, undivided road again, with the North Jersey Coast Line east of the road, and crosses the Shark River into Neptune.
Past the Shark River bridge, Route 35 continues as a four-lane divided highway that features an interchange with Memorial Drive (CR 40A), crossing into Neptune City. The route continues northwest away from the railroad tracks through residential and commercial areas of Neptune City as a four-lane, undivided highway before heading north as a two-lane, undivided road. Route 35 crosses back into Neptune, where it crosses the intersection of Corlies Avenue (Route 33). It continues through suburban development and comes to the Asbury Park Circle where the route intersects with Asbury Avenue (CR 16), crosses into Ocean Township, and intersects with the eastern terminus of Route 66. The route becomes a four-lane divided highway and passes by the Seaview Square Mall as it continues north through commercial areas, intersecting many roads with jughandles and passing near Weltz County Park. Route 35 passes through the intersection of Talmadge Avenue.
Route 35 then enters Eatontown, where it passes by the Monmouth Mall and intersects with Route 36 at the former Eatontown Circle, now an at-grade intersection with ramps. After that intersection, the route becomes an undivided highway. Consequently, Route 35 passes through a few more roads and commercial areas before finally crossing the intersection of Wyckoff Road (CR 547). Past this intersection, Route 35 intersects with Broad Street (Route 71), where it becomes Main Street. The route has an intersection of Tinton Avenue ((CR 537) next to the former entrance to Fort Monmouth. Route 35 crosses into Shrewsbury, where it becomes Broad Street and continues north through residential and commercial areas, passing by The Grove at Shrewsbury. It intersects with (CR 520), running concurrently with that route and immediately crossing the North Jersey Coast Line into Red Bank. Upon entering Red Bank, CR 520, along with CR 11, head north on Broad Street and Route 35 heads northwest on two-lane Maple Avenue, which turns north and passes by numerous homes. Route 35 splits from Maple Avenue, briefly head west on West Front Street, and rejoins on four-lane Riverside Avenue, where it heads northwest while the southbound direction follows Pearl Street and Water Street. Route 35 crosses the Navesink River into Middletown.

Past the Navesink River, the route runs along a four-lane, divided highway with a jersey barrier, passing through commercial areas. It crosses under Normandy Road, which serves as a road and railroad link between the two sections of Naval Weapons Station Earle. Along the northbound lanes of Route 35, just before the intersection of Kings Highway, stands the Evil Clown of Middletown, a large sign advertising a liquor store. A mixed-use complex, the Middletown Town Center, is also planned to be built in this area. The route intersects with Cherry Tree Farm Road (CR 516), running concurrently with that route as it enters Holmdel. The concurrency with CR 516 ends at the intersection with South Laurel Avenue, where that route heads to the north and CR 52 heads to the south on South Laurel Avenue. Route 35 continues west past numerous businesses and runs through Hazlet before crossing into Keyport. In Keyport, the route comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of Route 36 that also features access to the Garden State Parkway. Past this interchange, the road continues northwest and passes under the Henry Hudson Trail before it intersects with Nappi Place (CR 3), where it also features ramps to CR 516, which Route 35 passes under just to the north. Past this interchange, the road crosses the Matawan Creek into Aberdeen, where it heads northwest through Cliffwood and Cliffwood Beach.

===Middlesex and Union counties===

Route 35 crosses the Whale Creek into Old Bridge, Middlesex County, where it continues northwest through businesses and residences in Cliffwood Beach and Laurence Harbor, both sections of Old Bridge. It crosses the Cheesequake Creek on a drawbridge into Sayreville and turns to the west, passing over the North Jersey Coast Line. The road then intesects South Pine Avenue, which provides access to Bordentown Avenue (CR 615). Past this interchange, the route turns north and crosses into South Amboy, where Route 35 comes to an interchange and forms a concurrency with US 9. The two routes head through commercial areas and woodland, crossing over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; (CSAO) Amboy Secondary before interchanging with Raritan Street (CR 535) and Kearney Road, crossing back into Sayreville at the interchange with the former. US 9 and Route 35 split at an interchange (the former Victory Circle) that features access to the southbound direction of the Garden State Parkway by way of Chevalier Avenue, with Route 35 continuing north on a four-lane divided highway that passes through marshland and crosses the Raritan River on the Victory Bridge into Perth Amboy. In Perth Amboy, the route becomes four-lane, undivided Convery Boulevard upon crossing the intersection of Smith Street (CR 656).
The route continues north through commercial and residential sections of Perth Amboy, crossing over a connector to Route 440 and CSAO&#x27;s Perth Amboy Running Track line. It intersects the eastbound direction of Route 184, the former alignment of Route 440, before meeting the interchange of Route 440. Route 35 intersects the westbound direction of Route 184 and heads north, crossing into Woodbridge, where it becomes Amboy Avenue. In Woodbridge, the route passes by William Warren County Park and crosses over the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). Past the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95), the road heads into residential neighborhoods, crossing the intersection of Main Street (CR 514. Route 35 merges onto St. Georges Avenue and crosses CSAO&#x27;s Port Reading Secondary line before it comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 1/9. Past US 1/9, the road passes homes and businesses, heading into Rahway, Union County just before crossing the Rahway River. Upon entering Rahway, Route 35 crosses under Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor rail line just before ending at [[Lincoln Highway/St. Georges Avenue ([[New Jersey Route 27|Route 27]]). Route 27 continues north on St. Georges Avenue past the terminus of Route 35.

==History==

The present-day alignment of Route 35 follows parts of many 19th-century [[Toll road|turnpikes]], including the Middletown Turnpike, chartered in 1866 to run from Middletown to Red Bank, the Middletown and Keyport Turnpike, which was chartered on March 15, 1859, to run from Middletown Township to Keyport, and the Red Bank and Eatontown Turnpike, chartered on February 9, 1865, along present-day Broad Street, CR 11, and Route 35. The road running from Perth Amboy to Keyport, and from Point Pleasant to Seaside Heights, was signed as part of the Jersey Coast Way, running from the Staten Island Ferry to Cape May. 

In 1916, the current alignment of Route 35 was legislated as a part of [[Pre-1927 Route 4 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route 4]] between [[Point Pleasant, New Jersey|Point Pleasant]] and Brielle and from Eatontown to South Amboy. In the [[1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering]], Route 35 was designated to run from [[Lakewood, New Jersey|Lakewood]] to South Amboy, replacing pre-1927 Route 4 from Lakewood to Belmar and from Eatontown to South Amboy with the portion of pre-1927 Route 4 between Belmar and Eatontown becoming [[New Jersey Route 4N|Route 4N]] (now Route 71). At this time, US 9 followed the portions of Route 35 that were formerly a part of pre-1927 Route 4.

By the 1940s, Route 35 was designated onto its current alignment between Brielle and Belmar with the former alignment becoming a southern extension of Route 4N. US 9 was also moved off Route 35 onto a newly completed alignment of [[New Jersey Route 4|Route 4]] between Lakewood and South Amboy. In 1947, Route 35 was extended north to end at [[New Jersey Route 25|Route 25]] (now [[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|US 1]]) in [[Iselin, New Jersey|Iselin]], running concurrently with US 9. The current bridge over the Manasquan River and the bypass of Brielle were opened in 1951.

In the [[1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering]], the portion of Route 35 between Lakewood and Point Pleasant became Route 88, and Route 35 was designated to head south from Point Pleasant to Seaside Heights on what had been a part of Route 37. This section of Route 35 follows the [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] of the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] between Seaside Park and [[Mantoloking, New Jersey|Mantoloking]], which was removed in 1949. Also in the 1953 renumbering, the Route 35 designation was removed from the concurrency with US 9 between South Amboy and Iselin and reassigned to the former alignment of Route 4 between South Amboy and Route 27 in Rahway. 

In the late 1950s, plans were made for a [[freeway]] along the Route 35 corridor between Seaside Heights and [[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long Branch]] to reduce congestion along the current route. This proposed freeway was built as [[New Jersey Route 18|Route 18]] between Wall Township and Eatontown from 1965 to 1991 while the southern portion to Seaside Heights was never built. In the early 1970s, a Route 35 freeway was planned to run from Route 18 north to the planned [[New Jersey Route 74|Route 74]] freeway in [[Matawan, New Jersey|Matawan]] with an estimated cost of $53 million. This freeway was never built due to the cancellation of the Route 74 freeway in the mid-1970s.

The current interchange with Route 37 and the bypass around Seaside Heights were completed in 1958. The highway was turned into a one-way pair between Brick and Seaside Heights in 1961 by utilizing the former right-of-way of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. 

The section of the route through downtown Point Pleasant Beach was turned into a one-way pair in 1967. 

Route 35 was extended south to the entrance of Island Beach State Park by 1983. 

The [[Brielle Circle]] was eliminated and replaced by an intersection in 2001, which were both converted into at-grade intersections with traffic lights.

From 2002 and 2005, the Victory Bridge over the Raritan River was reconstructed at a cost of $109 million.

The Victory Circle was replaced with a diamond interchange between 2003 and 2006.

Between February 2006 and November 2008, the Woodbridge Cloverleaf interchange with US 1/9 in Woodbridge, first cloverleaf interchange in the United States built in 1929 when this portion of Route 35 was still a part of Route 4, was replaced with a partial cloverleaf interchange, costing $34 million.

The interchange with Route 36 in Eatontown originally did not intersect at a 90-degree angle; this was a remainder from the original Eatontown Circle. However, this posed a significant safety problem, and the need to rebuild the intersection again was planned. Because of this, in April 2010, NJDOT initiated construction to relocate the intersection to allow for a straighter roadway and a full cloverleaf configuration around the interchange. The project was declared largely complete on June 29, 2012.

On February 1, 2013, Route 35 through [[Mantoloking, New Jersey|Mantoloking]] was fully reopened after being closed since October 29, 2012 after [[Hurricane Sandy]] hit the area. The night of the storm at the intersection where the Mantoloking Bridge and Route 35 meet, a new inlet was formed by the raging storm waters. This effectively cut off the island from the mainland.

Beginning in March 2013 (after a six-month delay due to Hurricane Sandy), a four-year major construction project began on Route 35 between Raritan Boulevard/Birchwood Drive in [[Cliffwood Beach, New Jersey|Cliffwood Beach]] ([[Old Bridge Township, New Jersey|Old Bridge]]) and Amboy Avenue in [[Aberdeen Township, New Jersey|Aberdeen]]. The project includes several highway improvements designed to alleviate the flooding the highway is prone to due to its lowness and being adjacent in several areas to tidal marshes and [[Whale Creek]] and Long Neck Creek, widening of four intersections (Birchwood Drive, County Road, Cliffwood Avenue, and Amboy Avenue), and lane alignments, and additions for pedestrian and bicyclist safety. Also planned are traffic signal upgrades to reduce congestion. The project was expected to be completed in 2015.

In November 2020, construction was completed on a project to connect Taylor Lane with the CR 516 intersection in Middletown. This resulted in demolition of the former Jersey right that served that road northbound with a new diamond styled jug handle

<text>In Greek mythology, Echemus (; , &quot;Ekhemos&quot;) was the Tegean king of Arcadia who succeeded Lycurgus.

== Family ==
Echemus was the son of Aeropus, son of King Cepheus. He was married to Timandra, daughter of Leda and Tyndareus of Sparta. Timandra bore him a son, Ladocus, before deserting Echemus for Phyleus, the king of Dulichium. This lineage made Echemus a part of the Greek mythical family Atreidai, which stood in direct opposition to the Heracleidae, and emphasised the &quot;pre-dorian&quot; ancestry of the Tegeans and Arcadians.

An alternative genealogy makes Echemus a son of Aeropus, son of the war god Ares rather than Cepheus, this was a genealogy presented to Pausanias in Tegea, which he includes in his description of the temple of Ares Aphenius between the cities of Tegea and Pallantium.

== Mythology ==
After the death of Eurystheus, Hyllus led the Heracleidae to attack Mycenae. Echemus offered himself as the champion of the defending Arcadian forces and killed Hyllus in single combat, thus forcing the Heracleidae to withdraw. This story is mentioned by the Tegeans as an example of their people&#x27;s bravery in book 9 of &quot;The Histories&quot; by Herodotus; who puts in connection with a debate between the Tegeans and Athenians about who should cover the left part of the Hellenic army at the Battle of Plataea, the last major battle of the Persian Wars. Pausanias further lists this among the most important achievements of the Tegeans. Echemus defeat of Hyllus allegedly stopped the arrival of the Dorians in the Peloponnese, and the events were considered to have taken place when the Peloponnese was unified under rule of Tisamenus.

When visiting Tegea, Pausanias was shown the tomb of Echemus and a relief depicting his victory over Hyllus. A late Classical relief, now in the Archaeological Museum of Tegea, shows an inscription with the name Echemus.

Echemus was the victor in wrestling during the first Olympic games established by Heracles.

<text>Back Orifice (often shortened to BO) is a computer program designed for remote system administration. It enables a user to control a computer running the Microsoft Windows operating system from a remote location. The name is a play on words on Microsoft BackOffice Server software. It can also control multiple computers at the same time using imaging.

Back Orifice has a client–server architecture. A small and unobtrusive server program is on one machine, which is remotely manipulated by a client program with a graphical user interface on another computer system. The two components communicate with one another using the TCP and/or UDP network protocols. In reference to the Leet phenomenon, this program commonly runs on port 31337.

The program debuted at DEF CON 6 on August 1, 1998 and was the brainchild of Sir Dystic, a member of the U.S. hacker organization Cult of the Dead Cow. According to the group, its purpose was to demonstrate the lack of security in Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 9x series of operating systems.

Although Back Orifice has legitimate purposes, such as remote administration, other factors make it suitable for illicit uses. The server can hide from cursory looks by users of the system. Since the server can be installed without user interaction, it can be distributed as the payload of a Trojan horse.

For those and other reasons, the antivirus industry immediately categorized the tool as malware and appended Back Orifice to their quarantine lists. Despite this fact, it was widely used by script kiddies because of its simple GUI and ease of installation.

Two sequel applications followed it, Back Orifice 2000, released in 1999, and Deep Back Orifice by French Canadian hacking group QHA.

<doc id="83582" wikidata="Q636796" url="?curid=83582" title="Temenus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Temenus (, &quot;Tḗmenos&quot;) was a son of Aristomachus and brother of Cresphontes and Aristodemus.

Temenus was a great-great-grandson of Heracles and helped lead the fifth and final attack on Mycenae in the Peloponnese. He became King of Argos. He was the father of Ceisus, Káranos, Phalces (who was said to be founder of Sciyon), Agraeus, and Hyrnetho. Káranos was the first king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia and founder of the royal Macedonian dynasty–the Temenid or Argead dynasty–which culminated in the sons of Alexander the Great five centuries later.

==Conquest of the Peloponnese==
Temenus and his brothers complained to the oracle that its instructions had proved fatal to those who had followed them (the oracle had told Hyllas to attack through the narrow passage when the third fruit was ripe). They received the answer that by the &quot;third fruit&quot; the &quot;third generation&quot; was meant, and that the &quot;narrow passage&quot; was not the isthmus of Corinth, but the straits of Patras.

They accordingly built a fleet at Naupactus, but before they set sail, Aristodemus was struck by lightning (or shot by Apollo) and the fleet destroyed, because one of the Heracleidae had slain an Acarnanian soothsayer. The oracle, being again consulted by Temenus, bade him offer an expiatory sacrifice and banish the murderer for ten years, and look out for a man with three eyes to act as guide.

On his way back to Naupactus, Temenus fell in with Oxylus, an Aetolian, who had lost one eye, riding on a horse (or mule) (thus making up the three eyes) and immediately pressed him into his service. The Heracleidae repaired their ships, sailed from Naupactus to Antirrhium, and thence to Rhium in Peloponnesus.

A decisive battle was fought with Tisamenus, son of Orestes, the chief ruler in the peninsula, who was defeated and slain. The Heracleidae, who thus became practically masters of the Peloponnese, proceeded to distribute its territory among themselves by lot. Argos fell to Temenus, Lacedaemon to Procles and Eurysthenes, the twin sons of Aristodemus; and Messene to Cresphontes. The fertile district of Elis had been reserved by agreement for Oxylus. The Heracleidae ruled in Lacedaemon until 221 BC, but disappeared much earlier in the other countries.

This conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians, commonly called the &quot;Return of the Heracleidae&quot;, is represented as the recovery by the descendants of Heracles of the rightful inheritance of their hero ancestor and his sons. The Dorians followed the custom of other Greek tribes in claiming as ancestor for their ruling families one of the legendary heroes, but the traditions must not on that account be regarded as entirely mythical. They represent a joint invasion of Peloponnesus by Aetolians and Dorians, the latter having been driven southward from their original northern home under pressure from the Thessalians.

It is noticeable that there is no dominant mention of these Heracleidae or their invasion in Homer or Hesiod. Herodotus (vi. 52) speaks of poets who had celebrated their deeds, but these were limited to events immediately succeeding the death of Heracles. The story was first amplified by the Greek tragedians, who probably drew their inspiration from local legends, which glorified the services rendered by Athens to the rulers of the Peloponnese.

==Reign==
When Temenus, upon the division of the Peloponnese, had obtained Argos as his share, he bestowed all his affections upon his daughter Hyrnetho and her husband Deiphontes, for which he was murdered by his sons, who thought themselves neglected. According to Apollodorus, after the death of Temenus the army declared Deiphontes and Hyrnetho his rightful successors. Pausanias, however, reports a different story. According to him, after Temenus&#x27;s death it was not Deiphontes that succeeded him, but Ceisus. Deiphontes on the other hand is said to have lived at Epidaurus, whither he went with the army which was attached to him, and whence he expelled the Ionian king, Pityreus. His brothers-in-law, however, who begrudged him the possession of their sister Hyrnetho, went to Epidaurus and tried to persuade her to leave her husband; and when this attempt failed, they carried her off by force. Deiphontes pursued them, and after having killed one of them, Cerynes, he wrestled with the other, who held his sister in his arms. In this struggle, Hyrnetho was killed by her own brother, who then escaped. Deiphontes carried her body back to Epidaurus, and there erected a sanctuary to her.

According to the playwright Euripides, Temenus had a son named Archelaus. This was likely a fabrication to help solidify the connection to the Argive Heritage. The first historically accurate mention is the much later king Archelaus(413-399).

<text>In Greek mythology, Aristodemus (Ancient Greek: Ἀριστόδημος) was one of the Heracleidae, son of Aristomachus and brother of Cresphontes and Temenus. He was a great-great-grandson of Heracles and helped lead the fifth and final attack on Mycenae in the Peloponnese.

Aristodemus and his brothers complained to the oracle that its instructions had proved fatal to those who had followed them; the oracle had told Hyllas to attack through the narrow passage when the third fruit was ripe. They received the answer that by the &quot;third fruit&quot; the &quot;third generation&quot; was meant, and that the &quot;narrow passage&quot; was not the isthmus of Corinth, but the straits of Rhium. They accordingly built a fleet at Naupactus, but before they set sail, Aristodemus was struck by lightning (or shot by Apollo) and the fleet destroyed, because one of the Heraclidae had slain an Acarnanian soothsayer.

His brothers were later able to conquer the Peloponnese.

By his wife Argia, daughter of King Autesion of Thebes, he was the father of twin kings Eurysthenes and Procles, the ancestors of the two royal houses of Sparta.

<doc id="83588" wikidata="Q2803572" url="?curid=83588" title="Tisamenus (son of Orestes)">
<text>Tisamenus (Ancient Greek: Τισαμενός), in Greek mythology, was a son of Orestes and Hermione, daughter of Menelaus, or Erigone, daughter of Aegisthus who were first cousins twice over (their mothers were half-sisters and their fathers were brothers), so Tisamenus had only five great-grandparents, instead of the usual eight. Tisamenus succeeded his father to the thrones of Argos, Mycenae and Sparta.
== Mythology ==
Tisamenus was later killed in the final battle with the Heracleidae, who sought to retake the Peloponnese as their ancestral land. Following his death, the victors divided his lands among them. Cresphontes became King of Messene, Oxylus of Elis and Temenus of Argos. The twin sons of Aristodemus, Eurysthenes and Procles jointly received the throne of Sparta. The historical Kings of Sparta belonged to the co-ruling houses of the Agiads and Eurypontids and claimed their respective descent from the brothers.

<doc id="83589" wikidata="Q1164796" url="?curid=83589" title="Procles">
<text>In Greek legends, Procles (, &quot;the renowned&quot;) was one of the Heracleidae, a great-great-great-grandson of Heracles, and a son of Aristodemus and Argia. His twin was Eurysthenes. Together they received the land of Lacedaemon after Cresphontes, Temenus and Aristodemus defeated Tisamenus, the last Achaean king of the Peloponnesus. Procles married Anaxandra, daughter of Thersander, King of Kleonoe, sister of his sister-in-law Lathria, and was the father of Soos and the grandfather of Eurypon, founder of the Eurypontid dynasty of the Kings of Sparta.

The title of &quot;archēgetēs&quot;, &quot;founding magistrate,&quot; was explicitly denied to Eurysthenes and Procles by the later Spartan government on the grounds that they were not founders of a state, but were maintained in their offices by parties of foreigners. Instead the honor was granted to their son and grandson, for which reason the two lines were called the Agiads and the Eurypontids.

==Legend of the double kingship==

After the death of Aristodemus the Spartans consulted the oracle at Delphi concerning which of his twin sons should rule. The oracle advised them to set up a dual monarchy. Theras, Argeia&#x27;s brother was made regent. There was still a necessity of designating the elder. They chose the one the mother fed and cleaned first, Eurysthenes. Consequently, the Eurypontid line was the less senior in status and decision-making,

==Dates of the reigns of the first nine kings of the Eurypontid line==
The untimely death of Aristodemus with other events has served as some basis for dating the reigns of the first nine kings of Sparta in the line known by state definition as the Eurypontid. The Return of the Heracleidae, which is the closest event to a Dorian Invasion available in legend, must coincide with the entry of Aristodemus and his brethren into Arcadia, which, based on the chronology of Eratosthenes, happened 328 years before the generally accepted date of the first year of the first Olympiad, 776 BC. Eratosthenes&#x27; date is therefore 1104 BC. This must be the year of Aristodemus&#x27; military activity in Arcadia, his fatherhood and his assassination. Procles was therefore born in 1104 BC, which was the first year of his reign, if the regency of Theras is discounted.

Pausanias states that the end of the First Messenian War was the first year of the 14th Olympiad. The date must have been 724/723 BC if the first year of the first Olympiad was 776/775 BC. Kings Polydorus of the Agiads and Theopompus of the Eurypontids were reigning at that time, roughly in mid-reign. The end of the war must be 379 years from the return of the Heraclids. According to Isaac Newton, also a classical scholar, the nine kings reigned an average of 42 years each, which can be used as an estimator of the dates. The less senior line has a slightly lower mortality rate than the senior line. Procles&#x27; reign might be estimated at 1104–1062, except that some sources say he died one year before Eurysthenes. Taking into account both pieces of information, the estimate would be 1104–1063. An alternative would be to accept the 1104-1062 and extend the estimate for Eurysthenes to 1104–1061. In either the case margin of error remains unknown, as much of the data is relatively uncertain.

<text>Eurysthenes (, &quot;widely ruling&quot;) was king of Sparta and one of the Heracleidae in Greek mythology. He was a son of Aristodemus and Argia, daughter of Autesion. He had a twin brother, Procles. Together they received the land of Lacedaemon after Cresphontes, Temenus and Aristodemus defeated Tisamenus, the last Achaean king of the Peloponnesus. Eurysthenes married Lathria, daughter of Thersander, King of Kleonae, sister of his sister-in-law Anaxandra, and was the father of his successor, Agis I, founder of the Agiad dynasty of the Kings of Sparta.

The title of &quot;archēgetēs&quot;, &quot;founding magistrate,&quot; was explicitly denied to Eurysthenes and Procles by the later Spartan government on the grounds that they were not founders of a state, but were maintained in their offices by parties of foreigners. Instead the honor was granted to their son and grandson, for which reason the two lines were called the Agiads and the Eurypontids.

==Legend of the double kingship==
The story of the double kingship of Sparta begins with the invasion of the Peloponnesus by the Dorians, and the Aetolian allies, under three Heraclid commanders, Temenus, Cresphontes and Aristodemus, the three sons of Aristomachus. Karl Otfried Müller collected and evaluated the various fragments of the story from classical authors. According to Müller, the state of Elis in Arcadia, allies of the Aetolians, provided a guide (Oxylus) for passage through Arcadia after crossing the Gulf of Corinth from Naupactus. Arcadia gave them a central point from which to attack anywhere else in the Peloponnesus. Their presence was contested by a united Peloponnesian Achaean army (except for Arcadia) under Tisamenus, an Atreid. The Achaeans lost. They were commanded to evacuate to Athens, but many did not; furthermore, much of the region remained unconquered.

Nevertheless, the three commanders divided that which they did not yet possess, Peloponnesus. Following the signs of the gods, Aristodemus received Sparta. There is a question as to whether he ever was actually in possession there. One tradition says that he was and was therefore the first king of Sparta. A second asserts that he died before taking possession and that the Dorians brought his infant twin sons to Sparta as kings under a regent. Aristodemus was assassinated at Delphi by the Atreids. He had not even had time to designate a successor. The mother did not know which was the elder. The oracle at Delphi resolved the problem by suggesting that they both be made kings, which is the origin of the dual monarchy. Theras, Argeia&#x27;s brother, was made regent. There was still a necessity of designating the elder. They chose the one the mother fed and cleaned first, Eurysthenes.

==Dates of the reigns of the first ten kings of the Agiad line==
The untimely death of Aristodemus with other events has served as some basis for dating the reigns of the first ten kings of Sparta in the line known by state definition as the Agiad. The Return of the Heracleidae, which is the closest event to a Dorian Invasion available in legend, must coincide with the entry of Aristodemus and his brethren into Arcadia, which, based on the chronology of Eratosthenes, happened 328 years before the generally accepted date of the first year of the first Olympiad, 776 BC. Eratosthenes&#x27; date is therefore 1104 BC. This must be the year of Aristodemus&#x27; military activity in Arcadia, his fatherhood and his assassination. Eurysthenes was therefore born in 1104 BC, which was the first year of his reign, if the regency of Theras is discounted.

Pausanias states that the end of the First Messenian War was the first year of the 14th Olympiad. The date must have been 724/723 BC if the first year of the first Olympiad was 776/775 BC. Kings Polydorus of the Agiads and Theopompus of the Eurypontids were reigning at that time, roughly in mid-reign. The end of the war must be 379 years from the return of the Heraclids. According to Isaac Newton, also a classical scholar, the ten kings reigned an average of 38 years each, which can be used as an estimator of the dates. Eurysthenes would have ruled in 1104–1066 BC, with an unknown margin of error, as much of the data is relatively uncertain.

<text>In Greek mythology, Arne (; ), also called [[Melanippe (daughter of Aeolus)|Melanippe]] or [[Antiope (Greek myth)|Antiopa]], was the daughter of Aeolus and Melanippe (also Hippe or Euippe), daughter of Chiron.

== Mythology ==
Arne was born as a foal as her mother had been transformed into a horse as a disguise, but was returned to the human form and renamed Arne. According to John Tzetzes, Arne was the nurse of the young Poseidon, who denied knowing where he was when Cronus came searching for him. Aeolus entrusted her to the care of one Desmontes. However, Poseidon fathered Aeolus and Boeotus with her while he was in the form of a bull. Enraged, Desmontes entombed and blinded her and placed her twin sons on Mount Pelion. She was later rescued by her sons and married king Metapontus of Icaria, and Poseidon restored her vision.

Through Boeotus, she was the ancestress of the Boeotians. A city named after her was recorded in the &quot;Iliad&quot;&#x27;s Catalogue of Ships which has been tentatively identified with the ruins of Gla.

<text>A screenplay, or script, is a written work produced for a film, television show, or video game (as opposed to a stage play) by screenwriters. A screenplay written for television is also known as a &quot;teleplay&quot;. Screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. A screenplay is a form of narration in which the movements, actions, expressions and dialogue of the characters are described in a certain format. Visual or cinematographic cues may be given, as well as scene descriptions and scene changes.

==History==
In the early silent era, before the turn of the 20th century, &quot;scripts&quot; for films in the United States were usually a synopsis of a film of around one paragraph and sometimes as short as one sentence. Shortly thereafter, as films grew in length and complexity, film scenarios (also called &quot;treatments&quot; or &quot;synopses&quot;) were written to provide narrative coherence that had previously been improvised. Films such as &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; (1902) and &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903) had scenarios consisting respectively of a list of scene headings or scene headings with a detailed explication of the action in each scene. At this time, scripts had yet to include individual shots or dialogue.

These scenario scripts evolved into continuity scripts, which listed a number of shots within each scene, thus providing continuity to streamline the filmmaking process. While some productions, notably D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), were made without a script, preapproved &quot;continuities&quot; allowed the increasingly powerful studio executives to more accurately budget for film productions. Movie industry revolutionary Thomas H. Ince, a screenwriter himself, invented movie production by introducing an &quot;assembly line&quot; system of filmmaking that utilized far more detailed written materials, clearly dedicated to &quot;separating conception from execution&quot;. Film researcher Andrew Kenneth Gay posits that, &quot;The process of scripting for the screen did not so much emerge naturally from other literary forms such as the play script, the novel, or poetry nor to meet the artistic needs of filmmakers but developed primarily to address the manufacturing needs of industrial production.&quot;

With the advent of sound film, dialogue quickly dominated scripts, with what had been specific instructions for the filmmaker initially regressed to a list of master shots. However, screenwriters soon began to add the shot-by-shot details that characterized continuities of the films of the later silent era. &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), is written in this style, with detailed technical instructions interwoven with dialogue. The first use of the term &quot;screenplay&quot; dates to this era; the term &quot;screen play&quot; (two words) was used as early as 1916 in the silent era to refer to the film itself, i.e. a play shown on a screen.

With the end of the studio system in the 1950s and 1960s, these continuities were gradually split into a master-scene script, which includes all dialogue but only rudimentary scene descriptions and a shooting script devised by the director after a film is approved for production. While studio era productions required the explicit visual continuity and strict adherence to a budget that continuity scripts afforded, the master-scene script was more readable, which is of importance to an independent producer seeking financing for a project. By the production of &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974), this change was complete. Andrew Kenneth Gay argues that this shift has raised the status of directors as auteurs and lowered the profile of screenwriters. However, he also notes that since the screenplay is no longer a technical document, screenwriting is more of a literary endeavour.

== Format and style ==

The format is structured so that (as a ballpark estimate) &quot;one page&quot; equates to roughly &quot;one minute&quot; of screen time, though this often bears little resemblance to the runtime of the final production. The standard font is 12 point, 10 pitch Courier typeface. Wide margins of at least one inch are employed (usually larger for the left to accommodate hole punches).

The major components are action (sometimes called &quot;screen direction&quot;) and dialogue. The action is written in the present tense and is limited to what can be heard or seen by the audience, for example descriptions of settings, character movements, or sound effects. The dialogue is the words the characters speak, and is written in a center column.

Unique to the screenplay (as opposed to a stage play) is the use of &quot;slug lines&quot;. A &quot;slug line&quot;, also called a &quot;master scene heading&quot;, occurs at the start of each scene and typically contains three pieces of information: whether the scene is set inside or outside (INT. or EXT.; interior or exterior), the specific location, and the time of day. Each slug line begins a new scene. In a &quot;shooting script&quot; the slug lines are numbered consecutively for ease of reference.

===Physical format===

==== US ====
American screenplays are printed single-sided on three-hole-punched paper using the standard American letter size (). They are then held together with two brass brads in the top and bottom hole. The middle hole is left empty as it would otherwise make it harder to quickly read the script.

==== UK ====
In the United Kingdom, double-hole-punched A4 paper is normally used, which is slightly taller and narrower () than US letter size. Some UK writers format the scripts for use in the US letter size, especially when their scripts are to be read by American producers since the pages would otherwise be cropped when printed on US paper. Because each country&#x27;s standard paper size is difficult to obtain in the other country, British writers often send an electronic copy to American producers, or crop the A4 size to US letter.

A British script may be bound by a single brad at the top left-hand side of the page, making flicking through the paper easier during script meetings. Screenplays are usually bound with a light card stock cover and back page, often showing the logo of the production company or agency submitting the script, covers are there to protect the script during handling which can reduce the strength of the paper. This is especially important if the script is likely to pass through the hands of several people or through the post.

==== Other ====
Increasingly, &quot;reading copies&quot; of screenplays (that is, those distributed by producers and agencies in the hope of attracting finance or talent) are distributed printed on both sides of the paper (often professionally bound) to reduce paper waste. Occasionally they are reduced to half-size to make a small book which is convenient to read or put in a pocket; this is generally for use by the director or production crew during shooting.

Although most writing contracts continue to stipulate physical delivery of three or more copies of a finished script, it is common for scripts to be delivered electronically via email. Electronic copies allow easier copyright registration and also documenting &quot;authorship on a given date&quot;. Authors can register works with the Writers Guild of America West (WGAW) Registry, and even television formats using the FRAPA&#x27;s system.

== Screenplay formats ==
Screenplays and teleplays use a set of standardizations, beginning with proper formatting. These rules are in part to serve the practical purpose of making scripts uniformly readable blueprints of movies, and also to serve as a way of distinguishing a professional from an amateur.

===Feature film===

Motion picture screenplays intended for submission to mainstream studios, whether in the US or elsewhere in the world, are expected to conform to a standard typographical style known widely as the &quot;studio format&quot; which stipulates how elements of the screenplay such as scene headings, action, transitions, dialogue, character names, shots and parenthetical matter should be presented on the page, as well as font size and line spacing.

One reason for this is that, when rendered in studio format, most screenplays will transfer onto the screen at the rate of approximately one page per minute. This rule of thumb is widely contested — a page of dialogue usually occupies less screen time than a page of action, for example, and it depends enormously on the literary style of the writer — and yet it continues to hold sway in modern Hollywood.

There is no single standard for studio format. Some studios have definitions of the required format written into the rubric of their writer&#x27;s contract. The Nicholl Fellowship, a screenwriting competition run under the auspices of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, has a guide to screenplay format. A more detailed reference is &quot;The Complete Guide to Standard Script Formats&quot;.

==== Speculative screenplay ====
A speculative screenplay or &quot;spec script&quot; is a script written to be sold on the open market with no upfront payment, or promise of payment. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, though spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events.

===Television===
For American TV shows, the format rules for hour-long dramas and single-camera sitcoms are essentially the same as for motion pictures. The main difference is that TV scripts have act breaks. Multi-camera sitcoms use a different, specialized format that derives from stage plays and radio. In this format, dialogue is double-spaced, action lines are capitalized, and scene headings, character entrances and exits, and sound effects are capitalized and underlined.

Drama series and sitcoms are no longer the only formats that require the skills of a writer. With reality-based programming crossing genres to create various hybrid programs, many of the so-called &quot;reality&quot; programs are in a large part scripted in format. That is, the overall skeleton of the show and its episodes are written to dictate the content and direction of the program. The Writers Guild of America has identified this as a legitimate writer&#x27;s medium, so much so that they have lobbied to impose jurisdiction over writers and producers who &quot;format&quot; reality-based productions. Creating reality show formats involves storytelling structure similar to screenwriting, but much more condensed and boiled down to specific plot points or actions related to the overall concept and story.

===Documentaries===
The script format for documentaries and audio-visual presentations which consist largely of voice-over matched to still or moving pictures is different again and uses a two-column format which can be particularly difficult to achieve in standard word processors, at least when it comes to editing or rewriting. Many script-editing software programs include templates for documentary formats.

== Screenwriting software ==

Various screenwriting software packages are available to help screenwriters adhere to the strict formatting conventions. Detailed computer programs are designed specifically to format screenplays, teleplays, and stage plays. Such packages include BPC-Screenplay, Celtx, Fade In, Final Draft, FiveSprockets, Montage, Movie Draft SE, Movie Magic Screenwriter, Movie Outline 3.0, Scrivener, and Zhura. Software is also available as web applications, accessible from any computer, and on mobile devices, such as Fade In Mobile Scripts Pro and Studio Binder, and WriterDuet, which is available as a mobile application and a website.

The first screenwriting software was SmartKey, a macro program that sent strings of commands to existing word processing programs, such as WordStar, WordPerfect and Microsoft Word. SmartKey was popular with screenwriters from 1982 to 1987, after which word processing programs had their own macro features.

== Script coverage ==

&quot;Script coverage&quot; is a filmmaking term for the analysis and grading of screenplays, often within the script-development department of a production company. While coverage may remain entirely verbal, it usually takes the form of a written report, guided by a rubric that varies from company to company. The original idea behind coverage was that a producer&#x27;s assistant could read a script and then give their producer a breakdown of the project and suggest whether they should consider producing the screenplay or not.

<text>In Greek mythology, Assaracus (; Ancient Greek: Ἀσσάρακος &quot;Assarakos&quot;) was a king of Dardania.

== Family ==
Assaracus was the second son of Tros, King of Dardania by his wife Callirhoe, daughter of Scamander, or Acallaris, daughter of Eumedes. He was the brother of Ilus, Ganymede, Cleopatra and possibly of Cleomestra. Assaracus married Hieromneme, daughter of Simoeis; others say his wife was Clytodora, daughter of Laomedon. By either of them, he became the father of his son and heir Capys.

According to a less common version, Aesyetes and Cleomestra were also mentioned as parents of Assaracus. In this account, his brothers were Alcathous and Antenor. According to the Roman mythographer Hyginus, Ganymedes was not a brother of Assaracus, but rather his son.

== Mythology ==
Assaracus inherited the throne of Dardania when his elder brother Ilus preferred to reign instead over his newly founded city of Ilium (which also became known as Troy). When he died, the kingship passed to his son Capys. As a tribute to all his good work, Assaracus was buried in the midst of Troy, close to the temple of Athena and the later palace of Priam.

<text>In Roman and Greek mythology, Capys (; Ancient Greek: Κάπυς) was a name attributed to three individuals:

*Capys, king of Dardania.
*Capys, the Trojan who warned not to bring the Trojan horse into the city.
*Capys, mythological king of Alba Longa and descendant of Aeneas. Said to have reigned from 963 to 935 BC.

According to Roman sources, in the Etruscan language the word &quot;capys&quot; meant &quot;hawk&quot; or &quot;falcon&quot; (or possibly &quot;eagle&quot; or &quot;vulture&quot;).

<doc id="83606" wikidata="Q211953" url="?curid=83606" title="Anchises">
<text>In Greek and Roman mythology, Anchises (; ) was a member of the royal family of Troy. He was said to have been the son of King Capys of Dardania and Themiste, daughter of Ilus, who was son of Tros. He is most famous as the father of Aeneas and for his treatment in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Anchises&#x27; brother was Acoetes, father of the priest Laocoön.

He was a mortal lover of the goddess Aphrodite (equivalent to the Roman goddess Venus). Zeus made her fall in love with Anchises while he was herding sheep at the foot of Mount Ida. One version is that Aphrodite pretended to be a Phrygian princess and seduced him, only to later reveal herself and inform him that they would have a son named Aeneas; Aphrodite had warned Anchises that if he told anyone about her being the mother of his child, Zeus would strike him down with his thunderbolt. He did not heed her warning and was struck with a thunderbolt, which in different versions either blinds him or kills him. The principal early narrative of Aphrodite&#x27;s seduction of Anchises and the birth of Aeneas is the &quot;Homeric Hymn (5) to Aphrodite&quot;. According to the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Anchises and Aphrodite had another son, Lyrus, who died childless. He later had a mortal wife named Eriopis, according to the scholiasts, and he is credited with other children beside Aeneas and Lyrus. Homer, in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, mentions a daughter named Hippodamia, their eldest (&quot;the darling of her father and mother&quot;), who married her cousin Alcathous.

After the defeat of Troy in the Trojan War, the elderly Anchises was carried from the burning city by his son Aeneas, accompanied by Aeneas&#x27; wife Creusa, who died in the escape attempt, and small son Ascanius. The subject is depicted in several paintings, including a famous version by Federico Barocci in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. The rescue is also mentioned in a speech in Shakespeare&#x27;s Julius Caesar when Cassius attempts to persuade Brutus to murder Caesar. Anchises himself died and was buried in Sicily many years later. Aeneas later visited Hades and saw his father again in the Elysian Fields.

Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; mentions another Anchises, a wealthy native of Sicyon in Greece and father of Echepolus.

== The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite ==

The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite details how Aphrodite seduced Anchises. It begins by describing how only the three virgin goddesses (Athena, Artemis, and Hestia) are immune to Aphrodite&#x27;s powers. She has made gods and goddesses fall in love with mortals. Not even Zeus was able to escape her powers and to put her in her place, he caused her to lust after the handsome mortal Anchises.

Aphrodite first happens upon Anchises on the hills of Mount Ida, where he is grazing his cattle. Anchises is described as having the beauty of an immortal. Aphrodite goes to Cyprus and bathes. Then she returns to the Troad disguised as a mortal, and finds Anchises alone in a hut. When Anchises first sees Aphrodite, he is convinced that she is a goddess, a grace, or a nymph. She convinces him that she is a Phrygian princess and that Hermes brought her there to marry Anchises. Anchises is overcome with desire for her and declares that he must have her immediately, and the two of them make love.

After they have sex, Aphrodite puts Anchises into a deep sleep and dresses herself. When she is finished dressing, she wakes him up and reveals herself to him. When Anchises realizes her identity, he is terrified and full of regret and says that no good comes from sleeping with a goddess. Aphrodite comforts him by telling him that she will bear him a son by the name of Aeneas, who will be respected among the Trojans and whose offspring will prosper. To further comfort Anchises, she goes on to tell him about two relationships: the relationship between Zeus and Ganymede, and the relationship between Eos and Tithonus. Both relationships are between an immortal and a mortal who survives the relationship. She then details how their son will be raised by nymphs until he is five years old, at which time she will bring Aeneas to him. Then she leaves, warning him not to reveal that she is the mother of his child or Zeus will smite him.

== Anchises in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; ==
The &quot;Aeneid&quot; by Virgil describes the journey of Aeneas after the fall of Troy. Anchises, the father of Aeneas, is a character in the epic. Even though Anchises is dead for most of the epic, he still makes multiple appearances in it, oftentimes to advise Aeneas.

=== Book 2 ===

Anchises&#x27; first major appearance comes in Book 2. He is mentioned while Aeneas is telling Dido about the fall of Troy. During the fall of Troy, Aeneas makes his way home to save Anchises, his wife Creusa, and his son Ascanius. At first Anchises refuses to go with Aeneas and tells Aeneas to leave without him. Aeneas refuses to leave Anchises and declares that they will all die in Troy. Creusa argues with Aeneas over his decision and while they are arguing a painless flame appears on Ascanius&#x27; head. Anchises notices this and prays to Jupiter for a sign that they must leave. Just then they hear thunder and see a falling star. This convinces Anchises to go willingly with Aeneas. Aeneas carries Anchises on his back, Anchises carries their household gods, and Ascanius walks beside his father as they all flee Troy. Creusa was following behind them but is killed during the escape. As they leave Troy they meet up with other fleeing Trojans.

=== Book 3 ===
Anchises is mentioned in Book 3 while Aeneas continues his tale of how the Trojans came to be in Carthage. Anchises serves as a leader and advisor for the fleeing Trojans. After leaving Troy, the refugees make their way to Thrace and then to Delos. In Delos, Apollo tells them that they must make their new home in the original home of their ancestors. Anchises misinterprets this to mean Crete, so the Trojans head for Crete. There they establish a city, but they are soon overwhelmed by a plague. Anchises instructs Aeneas to seek out the Delian oracle. Before Aeneas does, he is visited in his dreams by their household gods who inform him that they are in the wrong place and must go to Italy. Aeneas tells Anchises of this dream. Anchises realizes that Apollo must have meant for them to establish a home in Italy, and so the Trojans head toward Italy. Italy is far away, and the Trojans must make many stops. Anchises dies in Sicily before the Trojans make it to Italy.

=== Book 5 ===
Anchises is mentioned in Book 5 after the Trojans leave Carthage. Storms force them to stop in Sicily, and Aeneas recalls that it has been a year since his father died, who had been buried with great honor. Aeneas declares for a festival to be held in honor of the deceased Anchises. Rituals are performed and sacrifices made at the tomb of Anchises. On the ninth day, Aeneas holds funeral games for his father that consist of a boat race, foot race, mock battle, boxing, and archery. After the funeral games, the Trojan women who have grown tired of traveling set fire to the ships. Even though most ships are saved by Jupiter, Aeneas loses heart and contemplates staying in Sicily. The ghost of Anchises appears, telling Aeneas that he was sent by the god Jupiter who saved the ships. He encourages Aeneas to continue his journey, informing him that he should leave the weary Trojans in Sicily and take the strongest with him to Italy. Anchises also instructs Aeneas to visit him in the underworld. Aeneas follows Anchises&#x27; advice and leaves Sicily, but before departing, he establishes that Anchises&#x27; tomb should be attended to by a priest and it should be designated a tract of woodland.

=== Book 6 ===
Anchises is mentioned in Book 6 when Aeneas voyages to the underworld. When Aeneas finds his father in the underworld, they have a tearful reunion. Aeneas tries to hug Anchises, yet he is unable. Aeneas then observes swarms of people gathered around a river. He asks his father about the river and those surrounding it. Anchises replies that the people are his future descendants and that the river is called Lethe. He expands that after suffering and being cleansed in the underworld, souls that are meant to be reincarnated go to the river Lethe to forget their memories so that they can be reincarnated. Anchises then shows Aeneas some of his descendants and discusses their deeds. He first mentions his son Silvius who will be born from Aeneas and Lavinia but after Aeneas is dead. Anchises then tells him of Romulus who is descended from Silvius, a member of the Caesarian line descended from Ascanius. He further describes that the Romans will prosper. Aeneas sees Marcellus and asks Anchises about his identity. Anchises states that he is Marcellus, who will hold great promise for the Romans but die too young and thus cause them great grief. Finally, Anchises leads Aeneas through the gates of horn and ivory and out of the underworld. This is the last major appearance of Anchises.

== Anchises in &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; ==

Anchises makes a few brief appearances in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses.&quot; He is first mentioned in Book 9. After youth was restored to Iolaus by Hebe, other gods and goddesses ask that it also be restored to their loved ones. (9.418-450) Venus asks that youth be restored to Anchises. (9.424-425)

Anchises is mentioned again in Book 13 in the story of the daughters of Anius. The story begins by briefly describing that Aeneas, Anchises, Ascanius, and other Trojan refugees fled Troy, traveled to Antandros, then to Thrace, and finally arrived in Delos. (13.623–631) Once in Delos, Anchises asks Anius, the king and a priest of Apollo, about his children. (13.639–642) Anius describes that his daughters received the ability to transform that which they touched into grain, wine, and olive oil, but this gift only caused them misery as the Greeks kidnapped them so as to take advantage of their powers. (13.651–659) His daughters asked to be freed, and thus they were turned into white doves. (13.667–674)

Anchises is briefly mentioned a couple of times in Book 14. First, in 14.82-84: &quot;And fleeing that new city in the sands, Aeneas once again returned to Eryx, the royal residence of his true friend Acestes; here, at Anchises&#x27; tomb he honored his father with gift offerings.&quot; This makes reference to the funeral games Aeneas held for his deceased father Anchises in Book 5 of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. And in 14.116-118: &quot;Aeneas did as he was told and saw the underworld&#x27;s formidable resources and his ancestral spirits and the shade of that great-spirited and venerable man, [his] father Anchises.&quot; This makes reference to the Aeneas&#x27; journey into the underworld, where he meets with the specter of his late father Anchises, in Book 6 of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

<doc id="83608" wikidata="Q822577" url="?curid=83608" title="New Jersey Route 38">
<text>Route 38 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey serving the Philadelphia metro area. It extends from the Airport Circle, where it intersects with US 30 and US 130, in Pennsauken, Camden County, east to an intersection of US 206 and South Pemberton Road (CR 530) in Southampton, Burlington County. The entire route is closely parallel to CR 537 located to the north, being only one block away at places. The route is a multilane divided highway for most of its length and passes through commercial development, residential development, and some farmland.

Route 38 was signed in 1927, replacing part of Pre-1927 Route 18, which had run from Camden east to Toms River. Route 38 was originally planned to be a freeway crossing the state of New Jersey, running from Camden east to Wall Township, Monmouth County. The eastern part of this freeway would become part of I-195 in the late 1960s. The freeway routing was then modified to head north of I-195 to Route 18 in Colts Neck but was ultimately canceled by the late 1970s due to environmental and financial concerns. Route 138 was originally numbered as a segment of Route 38, but was renumbered by the 1990s when it became apparent the freeway would not be completed.

==Route description==

Route 38 begins at the Airport Circle intersection of US 30, US 130, and Kaighns Avenue (CR 607) in Pennsauken, Camden County, heading east on Kaighns Avenue. It comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the western terminus of Route 70 that also connects to CR 601 (Marlton Pike) and CR 659 (Browning Road), which replaced the Browning Road Traffic Circle. A six–lane divided highway separated by a jersey barrier, it proceeds eastward, crossing into Cherry Hill, where it heads through commercial development. Route 38 features cloverleaf interchanges with Cuthbert Boulevard (CR 636) and Haddonfield Road (CR 644), passing under NJ Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line between the two interchanges. Past the interchange with Haddonfield Road (CR 644), Route 38 heads past the Cherry Hill Mall, located on the north side of the road. It proceeds through the Church Road Circle, where it crosses the intersection of Church Road (CR 616) and Coles Avenue/Cooper Landing Road (CR 627).

Route 38 crosses the South Branch of the Pennsauken Creek into Maple Shade, Burlington County. The route reaches a cloverleaf interchange with Route 41 before it has an interchange with Route 73 that also has access to Old Kings Highway. The Route 38-41-73 interchange complex replaced a dangerous and congested 6-way traffic circle. The route then crosses the intersection of Lenola Road (CR 608) into Moorestown, where it becomes unnamed. Route 38 travels by the Moorestown Mall located to the south before passing by the Strawbridge Lake Park located to the north, where it crosses the intersection of Church Street (CR 607) and then Mount Laurel Road (CR 603). It enters Mount Laurel, where it intersects with Marter Avenue (CR 615) before meeting I-295 at a partial cloverleaf interchange and passing over the New Jersey Turnpike without access.
It then continues east, heading into more residential areas and passing south of Rowan College at Burlington County. Route 38 intersects many roads with jughandles, including Hartford Road (CR 686), Ark Road (CR 635), and Masonville-Fostertown Road (CR 636) crossing into Hainesport, where it further intersects with Hainesport-Mount Laurel Road (CR 674), Creek Road (CR 636) without a traffic light, and Lumberton Avenue (CR 641). The route then crosses the South Branch of the Rancocas Creek before entering Lumberton, where the road intersects with Mount Holly Bypass (CR 541). Route 38 runs through the southern part of the Mount Holly area, intersecting with Madison Avenue/Main Street (CR 691), the former alignment of CR 541. It crosses into Mount Holly at the intersection of Pine Street/Eayrestown Road (CR 612). Past this intersection, Route 38 eventually becomes an undivided highway and then reenters Lumberton. The route then heads into farmland and crosses into Southampton at the intersection of Smithville Road (CR 684). Route 38 ends at the intersection of US 206, where the road continues east on South Pemberton Road (CR 530).

==History==

Prior to 1927, the route was a part of Pre-1927 Route 18, which was legislated in 1923 to run from Camden to Toms River. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 38 was legislated to run along the route from Route 25 (now U.S. Route 130) in Pennsauken east to Route 39 (now US 206) in Eastampton.

In 1938, Route 38 was legislated to extend from East Hampton to Route 4N (now Route 71) in Wall Township, Monmouth County. A section of this was built, running between Route 34 and Route 35 in Wall Township. The Route 38 freeway was then planned in 1961 to connect these two sections of Route 38. It was to run from I-680 (now I-676) in Camden east to the planned Route 35 freeway (now Route 18) in Wall Township, providing a direct freeway connection between the Philadelphia metro area and the northern portions of the Jersey Shore. The route of the freeway was to run east from the Ben Franklin Bridge, paralleling US 30 and then Route 70. It would then have run parallel to the current alignment of Route 38 through the Mount Holly area and then travel along the northern border of the Fort Dix Military Reservation to Jackson, Ocean County, where it would then follow the present alignment of I-195 to Wall Township. In the late 1960s, the eastern part of the Route 38 freeway became part of the proposed I-195.
In 1969, it was estimated the Route 38 freeway between I-295 in Cherry Hill and I-195 in Jackson would cost $60 million and be completed by 1985. The route of the freeway was revised in 1972 to head north of I-195 to Route 18 in Colts Neck, intersecting with Route 33 in Freehold Township. The western terminus was also moved to Mount Laurel, where it was to connect to the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 90, which was projected to extend to the New Jersey Turnpike. It was estimated that this routing of the Route 38 freeway would cost $101 million. However, due to environmental concerns of the route passing through the Pine Barrens and financial troubles, the freeway was canceled by the end of the 1970s. The orphaned eastern section of Route 38 in Monmouth County was renumbered to Route 138 on July 29, 1988.

<text>In Greek mythology, Iasus (; Ancient Greek: Ἴασος) or Iasius (; Ἰάσιος) was the name of several people:

*Iasus (Iasius), one of the Dactyli or Curetes.
*Iasus, king of Argos.
*Iasus, son of Io
*Iasius (Iasion), son of Eleuther and brother of Pierus. He was the father of Chaeresilaus and Astreis.
*Iasius, another name of Iasion.
*Iasus (Iasius), the Arcadian father of Atalanta by Clymene, daughter of Minyas; he was the son of King Lycurgus of Arcadia by either Eurynome or Cleophyle. His brothers were Ancaeus, Epochus and Amphidamas.
*Iasus (Iasius), father of King Amphion of Orchomenus. The latter married Persephone, daughter of Minyas, and fathered Chloris and Phylomache who both married the twins, Neleus and Pelias, respectively. This Iasius is likely the same with the above Iasus.

<text>In Greek mythology, Schoeneus (; Ancient Greek: Σχοινεύς &quot;Skhoineús&quot;, literally &quot;rushy&quot;) was the name of several individuals:

*Schoeneus, a Boeotian king, the son of Athamas and Themisto. He may have emigrated to Arcadia, where a village Schoenous and a river Schoeneus flowing by it were believed to have been named after him, and where his children were believed to have originated. He was the father of Atalanta, and also of the Arcadian Clymenus.
*Schoeneus, son of Autonous (son of Melaneus) and Hippodamia. He was the brother of Erodius, Acanthus, Acanthis and Anthus. When the latter was killed by their father&#x27;s horses, Zeus and Apollo pitied Schoeneus and transformed him into a bird.
*Schoeneus, a man who reared Orestes, from whose home Orestes directed to Argos to avenge the death of his father on Clytaemnestra.

<text>The sonata form (also sonata-allegro form or first movement form) is a musical structure generally consisting of three main sections: an exposition, a development, and a recapitulation. It has been used widely since the middle of the 18th century (the early Classical period).

While it is typically used in the first movement of multi-movement pieces, it is sometimes used in subsequent movements as well—particularly the final movement. The teaching of sonata form in music theory rests on a standard definition and a series of hypotheses about the underlying reasons for the durability and variety of the form—a definition that arose in the second quarter of the 19th century. There is little disagreement that on the largest level, the form consists of three main sections: an exposition, a development, and a recapitulation; however, beneath this general structure, sonata form is difficult to pin down to a single model.

The standard definition focuses on the thematic and harmonic organization of tonal materials that are presented in an exposition, elaborated and contrasted in a development and then resolved harmonically and thematically in a recapitulation. In addition, the standard definition recognizes that an introduction and a coda may be present. Each of the sections is often further divided or characterized by the particular means by which it accomplishes its function in the form.

After its establishment, the sonata form became the most common form in the first movement of works entitled &quot;sonata&quot;, as well as other long works of classical music, including the symphony, concerto, string quartet, and so on. Accordingly, there is a large body of theory on what unifies and distinguishes practice in the sonata form, both within and between eras. Even works that do not adhere to the standard description of a sonata form often present analogous structures or can be analyzed as elaborations or expansions of the standard description of sonata form. 

==Defining &#x27;sonata form&#x27;==
According to the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, sonata form is &quot;the most important principle of musical form, or formal type, from the Classical period well into the 20th century&quot;. As a formal model it is usually best exemplified in the first movements of multi-movement works from this period, whether orchestral or chamber, and has, thus, been referred to frequently as &quot;first-movement form&quot; or &quot;sonata-allegro form&quot; (since the typical first movement in a three- or four-movement cycle will be in allegro tempo). However, as what Grove, following Charles Rosen, calls a &quot;principle&quot;—a typical approach to shaping a large piece of instrumental music—it can be seen to be active in a much greater variety of pieces and genres, from minuet to concerto to sonata-rondo. It also carries with it expressive and stylistic connotations: &quot;sonata style&quot;—for Donald Tovey and other theorists of his time—was characterized by drama, dynamism, and a &quot;psychological&quot; approach to theme and expression.

Although the Italian term &quot;sonata&quot; often refers to a piece in sonata form, it is important to separate the two. As the title for a single-movement piece of instrumental music, &quot;sonata&quot;—the past participle of &quot;suonare&quot;, &quot;to play [an instrument]&quot;, as opposed to &quot;cantata&quot;, the past participle of &quot;cantare&quot;, &quot;to sing&quot;—covers many pieces from the Baroque and mid-18th century that are not &quot;in sonata form&quot;. Conversely, in the late 18th century or &quot;Classical&quot; period, the title &quot;sonata&quot; is typically given to a work composed of three or four movements. Nonetheless, this multi-movement sequence is not what is meant by sonata form, which refers to the structure of an individual movement.

The definition of sonata form in terms of musical elements sits uneasily between two historical eras. Although the late 18th century witnessed the most exemplary achievements in the form, above all from Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a compositional theory of the time did not use the term &quot;sonata form&quot;. Perhaps the most extensive contemporary description of the sonata-form type of movement may have been given by the theorist Heinrich Christoph Koch in 1793: like earlier German theorists and unlike many of the descriptions of the form we are used to today, he defined it in terms of the movement&#x27;s plan of modulation and principal cadences, without saying a great deal about the treatment of themes. Seen in this way, sonata form was closest to binary form, out of which it probably developed.

The model of the form that is often taught currently tends to be more thematically differentiated. It was originally promulgated by Anton Reicha in &quot;Traité de haute composition musicale&quot; in 1826, by Adolf Bernhard Marx in &quot;Die Lehre von der musikalischen Komposition&quot; in 1845, and by Carl Czerny in 1848. Marx may be the originator of the term &quot;sonata form&quot;. This model was derived from the study and criticism of Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas.

==Definition as a formal model==

A sonata-allegro movement is divided into sections. Each section is felt to perform specific functions in the musical argument.
* It may begin with an &quot;introduction&quot;, which is, in general, slower than the main movement.
* The first required section is the &quot;exposition&quot;. The exposition presents the primary thematic material for the movement: one or two themes or theme groups, often in contrasting styles and in opposing keys, connected by a modulating transition. The exposition typically concludes with a closing theme, a &quot;codetta&quot;, or both.
* The exposition is followed by the &quot;development&quot; where the harmonic and textural possibilities of the thematic material are explored.
* The development then re-transitions back to the &quot;recapitulation&quot; where the thematic material returns in the tonic key, and for the recapitulation to complete the musical argument, material that has not been stated in the tonic key is &quot;resolved&quot; by being played, in whole or in part, in the tonic.
* The movement may conclude with a &quot;coda&quot;, beyond the final cadence of the recapitulation.

The term &#x27;sonata form&#x27; is controversial and has been called misleading by scholars and composers almost from its inception. Its originators implied that there was a set template to which Classical and Romantic composers aspired, or should aspire. However, sonata form is currently viewed as a model for musical analysis, rather than compositional practice. Although the descriptions on this page could be considered an adequate analysis of many first-movement structures, there are enough variations that theorists such as Charles Rosen have felt them to warrant the plural in &#x27;sonata forms&#x27;.

These variations include, but are not limited to:
* a monothematic exposition, where the same material is presented in different keys, often used by Haydn;
* a &#x27;third subject group&#x27; in a different key than the other two, used by Schubert (e.g. in the String Quintet, D. 956), and Bruckner&#x27;s Symphony No. 4;
* the first subject recapitulated in the &#x27;wrong&#x27; key, often the subdominant, as in Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 16 in C, K. 545 and Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 5;
* the second subject group recapitulated in a key other than the tonic, as in Richard Strauss&#x27;s Symphony No. 2;
* and an extended coda section that pursues developmental, rather than concluding, processes, often found in Beethoven&#x27;s middle-period works, such as his Symphony No. 3.

Through the Romantic period, formal distortions and variations become so widespread (Mahler, Elgar and Sibelius among others are cited and studied by James Hepokoski) that &#x27;sonata form&#x27; as it is outlined here is not adequate to describe the complex musical structures that it is often applied to.

In the context of the many late-Baroque extended binary forms that bear similarities to sonata form, sonata form can be distinguished by the following three characteristics:
* a separate development section including a retransition
* the simultaneous return of the first subject group and the tonic
* a full (or close to full) recapitulation of the second subject group

==Outline of sonata form==

The standard description of the sonata form is:

===Introduction===

The &quot;introduction&quot; section is optional, or may be reduced to a minimum. If it is extended, it is, in general, slower than the main section and frequently focuses on the dominant key. It may or may not contain material that is later stated in the exposition. The introduction increases the weight of the movement (such as the famous dissonant introduction to Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Dissonance&quot; Quartet, K. 465), and also permits the composer to begin the exposition with a theme that would be too light to start on its own, as in Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 103 (&quot;The Drumroll&quot;) and Beethoven&#x27;s Quintet for Piano and Winds Op. 16. The introduction usually is not included in the exposition repeat: the &quot;Pathétique&quot; is a possible counterexample. Much later, Chopin&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35) is a clear example where the introduction is also included.

On occasion, the material of introduction reappears in its original tempo later in the movement. Often, this occurs as late as the coda, as in Mozart&#x27;s String Quintet in D major, K. 593, Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Drumroll&quot; Symphony, Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 8 (&quot;Pathétique&quot;), or Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 (&quot;Great&quot;). Sometimes it can appear earlier: it occurs at the beginning of the development in the &quot;Pathétique&quot; Sonata, and at the beginning of the recapitulation of Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 1.

===Exposition===
The primary thematic material for the movement is presented in the exposition. This section can be further divided into several sections. The same section in most sonata form movements has prominent harmonic and thematic parallelisms (although in some works from the 19th century and onward, some of these parallelisms are subject to considerable exceptions), which include:
* &quot;First subject group&quot;, &quot;P&quot; (Prime) – this consists of one or more themes, all in the tonic key. Although there are exceptions, most pieces follow this form.
* &quot;Transition&quot;, &quot;T&quot; – in this section the composer modulates from the key of the first subject to the key of the second. If the first group is in a major key, the second group will usually be in the dominant key. However, if the first group is in a minor key, the second group will usually be the relative major.
* &quot;Second subject group&quot;, &quot;S&quot; – one or more themes in a different key (typically the dominant) from the first group. The material of the second group is often different in rhythm or mood from that of the first group (frequently, it is more lyrical) and is often stated at a piano dynamic.
* &quot;Closing zone (or closing area)&quot;, &quot;C&quot; – a suffix after the end of the second subject group that reinforces the new key area. C involves musical material that differs from what was heard in S, and often includes distinctly new thematic material.
The exposition is commonly repeated, particularly in classical and early romantic works, and more likely in solo or chamber works and symphonies than for concerti. Often, though not always, first and second endings are employed during the last measure(s) of the exposition. The first ending to point back to the tonic, where the exposition began, and the second ending to point towards the development.

===Development===

In general, the development starts in the same key as the exposition ended, and may move through many different keys during its course. It will usually consist of one or more themes from the exposition altered and on occasion juxtaposed and may include new material or themes—though exactly what is acceptable practice is a point of contention. Alterations include taking material through distant keys, breaking down of themes and sequencing of motifs, and so forth.

The development varies greatly in length from piece to piece and from time period to time period, sometimes being relatively short compared to the exposition (e.g., the first movement of &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot;) and in other cases quite long and detailed (e.g., the first movement of the &quot;Eroica&quot; Symphony). Developments in the Classical era are typically shorter due to how much composers of that era valued symmetry, unlike the more expressive Romantic era in which development sections gain a much greater importance. However, it almost always shows a greater degree of tonal, harmonic, and rhythmic instability than the other sections. In a few cases, usually in late Classical and early Romantic concertos, the development section consists of or ends with another exposition, often in the relative minor of the tonic key.

At the end, the music will usually return to the tonic key in preparation of the recapitulation. (On occasion, it will actually return to the sub-dominant key and then proceed with the same transition as in the exposition.) The transition from the development to the recapitulation is a crucial moment in the work. The last part of the development section is called the &quot;&quot;: It prepares for the return of the first subject group in the tonic.

Exceptions include the first movement of Brahms&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 1. The general key of the movement is C major, and it would then follow that the retransition should stress the dominant seventh chord on G. Instead, it builds in strength over the dominant seventh chord on C, as if the music were proceeding to F major, only to take up immediately the first theme in C major. Another exception is the fourth movement of Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 9. The home key of the movement is C major. The retransition prolongates over the dominant chord on G, but suddenly takes up the first theme in the flattened mediant E major.

A particularly common exception is for the dominant to be substituted with the dominant of the relative minor key: one example is the first movement of Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet in E major, Op. 54 No. 3.

Occasionally, the retransition can begin with a false recapitulation, in which the opening material of the first theme group is presented before the development has completed. The surprise that ensues when the music continues to modulate toward the tonic can be used for either comic or dramatic effect. An example occurs in the first movement of Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet in G major, Op. 76 No. 1.

===Recapitulation===

The recapitulation is an altered repeat of the exposition, and consists of:
* &quot;First subject group&quot; – normally given prominence as the highlight of a recapitulation, it is usually in exactly the same key and form as in the exposition.
* &quot;Transition&quot; – often the transition is carried out by introducing a novel material: a kind of an additional brief development. It is called a &quot;secondary development&quot;.
* &quot;Second subject group&quot; – usually in roughly the same form as in the exposition, but now in the home key, which sometimes involves change of mode from major to minor, or vice versa, as occurs in the first movement of Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 40 (K. 550). More often, however, it may be recast in the parallel major of the home key (for example, C major when the movement is in C minor like Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 in C Minor, op. 67/I). Key here is more important than mode (major or minor); the recapitulation provides the needed balance even if the material&#x27;s mode is changed, so long as there is no longer any key conflict.
Exceptions to the recapitulation form include Mozart and Haydn works that often begin with the second subject group when the first subject group has been elaborated at length in the development. If a theme from the second subject group has been elaborated at length in the development in a resolving key such as the tonic major or minor or the subdominant, it may also be omitted from the recapitulation. Examples include the opening movements of Mozart&#x27;s piano sonata in C minor, K. 457, and Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet in G major, Op. 77 No. 1.

After the closing cadence, the musical argument proper is said to be completed harmonically. If the movement continues, it is said to have a coda.

===Coda===
The coda is optional in Classical-era works, but became essential in many Romantic works. After the final cadence of the recapitulation, the movement may continue with a coda that will contain material from the movement proper. Codas, when present, vary considerably in length, but like introductions are not generally part of the &quot;argument&quot; of the work in the Classical era. Codas became increasingly important and essential parts of the sonata form in the nineteenth century. The coda often ends with a perfect authentic cadence in the original key. Codas may be quite brief tailpieces, typically in the Classical era, or they may be very long and elaborate. An example of the more extended type is the coda to the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Eroica Symphony, and an exceptionally long coda appears at the end of the finale of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 8.

Explanations for why an extended coda is present vary. One reason may be to omit the repeat of the development and recapitulation sections found in earlier sonata forms of the 18th century. Indeed, Beethoven&#x27;s extended codas often serve the purpose of further development of thematic material and resolution of ideas left unresolved earlier in the movement. Another role that these codas sometimes serve is to return to the minor mode in minor-key movements where the recapitulation proper concludes in the parallel major, as in the first movements of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 or Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto, or rarely, to restore the home key after an off-tonic recapitulation, such as in the first movements of Brahms&#x27;s Clarinet Quintet and Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony No. 9.

==Variations on the standard schema==

===Monothematic expositions===
It is not necessarily the case that the move to the dominant key in the exposition is marked by a new theme. Haydn in particular was fond of using the opening theme, often in a truncated or otherwise altered form, to announce the move to the dominant, as in the first movement of his Sonata Hob. XVI/49 in E major. Mozart also occasionally wrote such expositions: for instance in the Piano Sonata K. 570 or the String Quintet K. 593. Such expositions are often called &quot;monothematic&quot;, meaning that one theme serves to establish the opposition between tonic and dominant keys. This term is misleading, since most &quot;monothematic&quot; works have multiple themes: most works so labeled have additional themes in the second subject group. Rarely, as in the fourth movement of Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet in B major, Op. 50, No. 1, did composers perform the &quot;tour de force&quot; of writing a complete sonata exposition with just one theme. A more recent example is Edmund Rubbra&#x27;s Symphony No. 2.

The fact that so-called monothematic expositions usually have additional themes is used by Charles Rosen to illustrate his theory that the Classical sonata form&#x27;s crucial element is some sort of &quot;dramatization&quot; of the arrival of the dominant. Using a new theme was a very common way to achieve this, but other resources such as changes in texture, salient cadences and so on were also accepted practice.

=== No transitions between the first and second subject groups ===
In some sonata-form works, especially in the Classical period, there is no transitional material linking the subject groups. Instead, the piece moves straight from the first subject group to the second subject group via common-tone modulation. This happens in the first movement of Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 31 and again in the third movement of his Symphony No. 34. It also occurs in the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 1. In the exposition, the first subject group ends on a half-cadence in tonic, and the second subject group immediately follows in the dominant key (without a transition).

=== Expositions that modulate to other keys ===
The key of the second subject may be something other than the dominant (for a major-mode sonata movement) or relative major (for a minor-key movement). A second option for minor-mode sonata form movements was to modulate to the minor dominant; this option, however, robs the sonata structure of the space of relief and comfort that a major-mode second theme would bring, and was therefore used primarily for a bleak, grim effect, as Beethoven did with some frequency. Mendelssohn also did this in the first movement of his Symphony No. 3 and the last movement of his Symphony No. 4.

About halfway through his career, Beethoven also began to experiment with other tonal relationships between the tonic and the second subject group. The most common practice, for Beethoven and many other composers from the Romantic era, was to use the mediant or submediant, rather than the dominant, for the second group. For instance, the first movement of the &quot;Waldstein&quot; sonata, in C major, modulates to the mediant E major, while the opening movement of the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; sonata, in B major, modulates to the submediant G major, and String Quartet No. 13 in the same key modulating to the flattened submediant key of G major. Tchaikovsky also implemented this practice in the last movement of his Symphony No. 2; the movement is in C major and modulates to the flattened submediant A major. The young Chopin even experimented with expositions that do not modulate at all, in the opening movements of his Piano Sonata No. 1 (remaining in C minor throughout) and his Piano Concerto No. 1 (moving from E minor to E major).

Beethoven began also to use the submediant major with more frequency in minor-key sonata-form movements, as in the first movements of Symphony No. 9, Piano Sonata No. 32, and String Quartets No. 11 and No. 15. The latter case transposes the second repeat of its exposition by a fifth, starting on the minor dominant (instead of the tonic) and finishing on the major mediant (instead of the submediant). The first movement of Richard Strauss&#x27;s Symphony No. 2, in F minor, modulates to the submediant D major, as do the F minor first movements of Brahms&#x27; first clarinet sonata and piano quintet; all three works balance this downward third by moving up to the major mediant (A major) for the key of the second movement.

Rarely, a major-mode sonata form movement will modulate to a minor key for the second subject area, such as the mediant minor (Beethoven Sonata Op. 31/1, i), the relative minor (first movements of Beethoven Triple Concerto and Brahms Piano Trio No. 1) or even the minor dominant (Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2, i). In such cases, the second theme will often return initially in the tonic minor in the recapitulation, with the major mode restored later on.

During the late Romantic period, it was also possible to modulate to remote tonal areas to represent divisions of the octave. In the first movement of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 4, the first subject group is in the tonic F minor but modulates to G minor and then to B major for the second subject group. The recapitulation begins in D minor and modulates to F major, and goes back to the parallel F minor for the coda.

Also in the late Romantic period, it was possible for a minor-key sonata form movement to modulate to the major dominant, as in the first movements of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 and Brahms&#x27; Symphony No. 4.

===Expositions with more than two key areas===
The exposition need not only have two key areas. Some composers, most notably Schubert, composed sonata forms with three or more key areas. The first movement of Schubert&#x27;s Quartet in D minor, D. 810 (&quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;), for example, has three separate key and thematic areas, in D minor, F major, and A minor. Similarly, Chopin&#x27;s Piano Concerto in F minor uses F minor, A major, and C minor in its first movement&#x27;s exposition. In both cases, the transition is i–III–v, an elaboration of the minor schema of either using i–III or i–v. This is by no means the only scheme, however: the opening movement of Schubert&#x27;s Violin Sonata in G minor, D. 408, uses the scheme i–III–VI, and the opening movement of Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 in B major, D. 125, uses the scheme I–IV–V. The first movement of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 uses the scheme i–v–VII. An extreme example is the finale to Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 6, D. 589, which has a six-key exposition (C major, A major, F major, A major, E, and G major), with a new theme for each key. 

The second subject group can start in a particular key and then modulate to that key&#x27;s parallel major or minor. In the first movement of Brahms&#x27; Symphony No. 1 (in C minor), the second subject group begins in the relative E major and goes to the parallel mediant E minor. Similarly, the opening movement of Dvorak&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 in E minor has its second subject group start in the minor mediant G minor and then to its parallel G major. And in the opening movement of his Symphony No. 6 in D major, the first theme of the second subject group is in the relative B minor while the second theme is in the parallel submediant B major.

===Modulations within the first subject group===
The first subject group need not be entirely in the tonic key. In the more complex sonata expositions there can be brief modulations to fairly remote keys, followed by reassertion of the tonic. For example, Mozart&#x27;s String Quintet in C, K. 515, visits C minor and D major as chromaticism within the C major first subject group, before finally moving to D major, the dominant of the dominant major (G major), preparing the second subject group in the dominant. Many works by Schubert and later composers utilized even further harmonic convolutions. In the first subject group of Schubert&#x27;s Piano Sonata in B, D. 960, for example, the theme is presented three times, in B major, in G major, and then again in B major. The second subject group is even more wide-ranging. It begins in F minor, moves into A major, then through B major to F major.

===Recapitulations in the &quot;wrong key&quot;===
In the recapitulation section, the key of the first subject group may be in a key other than tonic, most often in the subdominant, known as a &quot;subdominant recapitulation&quot;. In some pieces by Haydn and Mozart, such as Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 16 in C, K. 545, or the finale of his String Quartet No. 14 in G, K. 387, the first subject group will be in the subdominant and then modulate back to tonic for the second subject group and coda. This case is also found in the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Kreutzer&quot; sonata. Schubert was also a prominent user of the subdominant recapitulation; it appears for example in the opening movements of his Symphonies No. 2 and No. 5, as well as those of his piano sonatas D 279, D 459, D 537, D 575, as well as the finale of D 664. Sometimes this effect is also used for false reprises in the &quot;wrong key&quot; that are soon followed by the actual recapitulation in the tonic, such as in the first movement of Haydn&#x27;s quartet Op. 76 No. 1 in G (false reprise in the subdominant), or the finale of Schubert&#x27;s piano sonata in A, D 959 (false reprise in the major submediant). A special case is the recapitulation that begins in the tonic minor, for example in the slow movement of Haydn&#x27;s quartet Op. 76 No. 4 in E, or the opening movement of Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 47 in G major. In the Classical period, the subdominant is the only possible substitute for the tonic at this position (because any other key would need resolution and would have to be introduced as a false reprise in the development), but with the erosion of the distinction between the sharp and flat directions and the blurring of tonal areas true recapitulations beginning in other keys became possible after around 1825.

It is possible for the first subject group to begin in tonic (or a key other than tonic), modulate to another key and then back to tonic for the second subject group. In the finale of the original 1872 version of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 2, the first subject group begins in the tonic C major, modulates to E major, then through E major, and then modulates back to tonic for the second subject group and coda. And in the last movement of Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 in C major, the first subject group is in the flattened mediant E major, modulates to the subdominant F major and then back to tonic for the second subject group and coda. It is also possible to have the second subject group in a key other than tonic while the first subject group is in the home key. For instance in the first movement of Richard Strauss&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 in F minor, the recapitulation begins with the first subject group in tonic but modulates to the mediant A major for the second subject group before modulating back to F minor for the coda. Another example is the first movement of Dvorak&#x27;s Symphony No. 9. The recapitulation begins in the tonic E minor for the first subject group, but the second subject group modulates to G-sharp minor, then through A-flat major before modulating back to the tonic key for the coda. Similarly, in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Waldstein&quot; Sonata, the first subject group is in the tonic C major, then modulates to A major for the first part of the second subject group but quickly goes through A minor to modulate back to tonic for the rest of the second subject group and coda. 

Another possibility is both subject groups in the recapitulation going through multiple keys. In the first movement of Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 8, the first subject group begins in the tonic B minor but modulates to E minor and then to F minor. The second subject group starts in the mediant D major before modulating to the parallel tonic B major.

Romantic works even exhibit progressive tonality in sonata form: for example, the second movement &#x27;Quasi-Faust&#x27; from Charles-Valentin Alkan&#x27;s &quot;Grande sonate &#x27;Les quatre âges&#x27;&quot; is in D minor, and while the exposition travels from D to the major subdominant G major, the recapitulation begins again in D minor and ends in the relative major F major, and stays there till the end of the movement. Such a scheme may have been constructed to conform with the programmatic nature of the movement, but also fits well with the Romantic penchant for beginning a work at maximum tension and decreasing the tension afterwards, so that the point of ultimate stability is not reached until the last possible moment. (Furthermore, the identification of a minor key with its relative major is common in the Romantic period, supplanting the earlier Classical identification of a minor key with its parallel major.)

===Partial or varied recapitulations===
In some pieces in sonata form, in the recapitulation, the first subject group is omitted, leaving only the second subject group, like the second movement of Haydn&#x27;s Sonata Hob. XVI/35, as well as the opening movements of Chopin&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 2 and No. 3. It is also possible for the first subject group to be slightly different in comparison of the exposition, like the fourth movement of Dvorak&#x27;s Symphony No. 9. Another example occurs in the finale of Mozart&#x27;s string quartet K. 387, where the opening of the first subject group is cut, and in the quintet K. 515, where a later portion of the first subject group is cut. On the other hand, it is also possible for the subject groups to be reversed in order, like the fourth movement of Bruckner&#x27;s Symphony No. 7, or the first movement of Mozart&#x27;s piano sonata in D major, K. 311. The second subject group&#x27;s melody can be different compared to the exposition, like Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 44. Such melodic adjustment is common in minor-key sonata forms, when the mode of the second subject needs to be changed, for example in the opening movement of Mozart&#x27;s wind serenade K. 388. In rare cases, the second subject theme can be omitted, as in the finale of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Violin Concerto in D major.

===Truncated sonata form===
Occasionally, especially in some Romantic works, the sonata form extends only as far as the end of the exposition, at which point the piece transitions directly into the next movement instead of a development section. One example is Henryk Wieniawski&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 2 in D minor. Another example is Fritz Seitz&#x27;s Violin Concertos for students, where such a truncated sonata form is used ostensibly to cut down on the first movements&#x27; length. Sometimes, the third movement of such works is the recapitulation of the first movement (one example being Franz Strauss&#x27; Horn Concerto in C Minor), making the entire work effectively a single-movement sonata.

Some Classical slow movements involve a different sort of truncation, in which the development section is replaced altogether by a short retransition. This occurs in the slow movements of Mozart&#x27;s quartets K. 387, K. 458, K. 465, K. 575, and K. 589. It is also common in overtures, occurring for example in Mozart&#x27;s overture to &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, or Rossini&#x27;s overture to &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;. This is distinct from a short development, such as in the opening movement of Mozart&#x27;s Violin Sonata in G major, K. 379.

Another instance of a truncated sonata form has the development section completely omitted altogether, and the recapitulation immediately follows the exposition (even without a retransitional passage). This occurs in the first movement of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Serenade for Strings, and is known as sonatina form.

==In concerti==

An important variant on traditional sonata-allegro form is found in the first movement of the Classical concerto. Here, the sonata-allegro&#x27;s customary &#x27;repeated exposition&#x27; is replaced by two different but related sections: the &#x27;tutti exposition&#x27; and the &#x27;solo exposition&#x27;. Prototypically the &#x27;tutti exposition&#x27; does not feature the soloist (except, in early classical works, in a &#x27;continuo&#x27; role), and does not contain the decisive sonata-exposition modulation to the secondary key. Only when the &#x27;solo exposition&#x27; is under way does the solo instrument assert itself and participate in the move to (classically) the dominant or relative major. The situation is only seemingly different in the case of Mozart&#x27;s concerto No. 9, where the soloist is heard at the outset: as the later unfolding of those movements makes clear, the opening piano solo or early piano flourishes actually &quot;precede&quot; the start of the exposition proper. This presentation is also found in Classical-to-Romantic transition, such as Beethoven&#x27;s piano concertos No. 4 or No. 5, and Romantic concertos, like Grieg&#x27;s A minor concerto or Brahms&#x27; B major concerto.

A structural feature that the special textural situation of the concerto makes possible is the &#x27;ownership&#x27; of certain themes or materials by the solo instrument; such materials will thus not be exposed until the &#x27;solo&#x27; exposition. Mozart was fond of deploying his themes in this way.

Towards the end of the recapitulation of a concerto movement in sonata form, there is usually a cadenza for the soloist alone. This has an improvisatory character (it may or may not actually be improvised), and, in general, serves to prolong the harmonic tension on a dominant-quality chord before the orchestra ends the piece in the tonic.

Some may decline the existence of &quot;double exposition&quot; - they would say the first subject theme actually extends far out from the start of the &quot;tutti exposition&quot; to the first subject of the &quot;solo exposition&quot;, meaning there is only one exposition.

==History==
The term &quot;sonata&quot; is first found in the 17th century, when instrumental music had just begun to become increasingly separated from vocal music. The original meaning of the term (derived from the Italian word &quot;suonare&quot;, to sound on instrument) referred to a piece for playing, distinguished from &quot;cantata&quot;, a piece for singing. At this time, the term implies a binary form, usually AABB with some aspects of three part forms. Early examples of simple pre-Classical sonata forms include Pergolesi&#x27;s Trio Sonata No. 3 in G major.

The Classical era established the norms of structuring first movements and the standard layouts of multi-movement works. There was a period of a wide variety of layouts and formal structures within first movements that gradually became expected norms of composition. The practice of Haydn and Mozart, as well as other notable composers, became increasingly influential on a generation that sought to exploit the possibilities offered by the forms that Haydn and Mozart had established in their works. In time, theory on the layout of the first movement became more and more focused on understanding the practice of Haydn, Mozart and, later, Beethoven. Their works were studied, patterns and exceptions to those patterns identified, and the boundaries of acceptable or usual practice set by the understanding of their works. The sonata form as it is described is strongly identified with the norms of the Classical period in music. Even before it had been described, the form had become central to music making, absorbing or altering other formal schemas for works. Examples include Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Appassionata&quot; sonata.

The Romantic era in music was to accept the centrality of this practice, codify the form explicitly and make instrumental music in this form central to concert and chamber composition and practice, in particular for works that were meant to be regarded as &quot;serious&quot; works of music. Various controversies in the 19th century would center on exactly what the implications of &quot;development&quot; and sonata practice actually meant, and what the role of the Classical masters was in music. It is ironic that, at the same time that the form was being codified (by the likes of Czerny and so forth), composers of the day were writing works that flagrantly violated some of the principles of the codified form.

It has continued to be influential through the subsequent history of classical music through to the modern period. The 20th century brought a wealth of scholarship that sought to found the theory of the sonata form on basic tonal laws. The 20th century would see a continued expansion of acceptable practice, leading to the formulation of ideas by which there existed a &quot;sonata principle&quot; or &quot;sonata idea&quot; that unified works of the type, even if they did not explicitly meet the demands of the normative description.

==Sonata form and other musical forms==

Sonata form shares characteristics with both binary form and ternary form. In terms of key relationships, it is very like binary form, with a first half moving from the home key to the dominant and the second half moving back again (this is why sonata form is sometimes known as &quot;compound binary form&quot;); in other ways it is very like ternary form, being divided into three sections, the first (exposition) of a particular character, the second (development) in contrast to it, the third section (recapitulation) the same as the first.

The early binary sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti provide excellent examples of the transition from binary to sonata-allegro form. Among the many sonatas are numerous examples of the true sonata form being crafted into place.

==Sonata theory==
The sonata form is a guide to composers as to the schematic for their works, for interpreters to understand the grammar and meaning of a work, and for listeners to understand the significance of musical events. A host of musical details are determined by the harmonic meaning of a particular note, chord or phrase. The sonata form, because it describes the shape and hierarchy of a movement, tells performers what to emphasize, and how to shape phrases of music. Its theory begins with the description, in the 18th century, of schematics for works, and was codified in the early 19th century. This codified form is still used in the pedagogy of the sonata form.

In the 20th century, emphasis moved from the study of themes and keys to how harmony changed through the course of a work and the importance of cadences and transitions in establishing a sense of &quot;closeness&quot; and &quot;distance&quot; in a sonata. The work of Heinrich Schenker and his ideas about &quot;foreground&quot;, &quot;middleground&quot;, and &quot;background&quot; became enormously influential in the teaching of composition and interpretation. Schenker believed that inevitability was the key hallmark of a successful composer, and that, therefore, works in sonata form should demonstrate an inevitable logic.

In the simplest example, playing of a cadence should be in relationship to the importance of that cadence in the overall form of the work. More important cadences are emphasized by pauses, dynamics, sustaining and so on. False or deceptive cadences are given some of the characteristics of a real cadence, and then this impression is undercut by going forward more quickly. For this reason, changes in performance practice bring changes to the understanding of the relative importance of various aspects of the sonata form. In the Classical era, the importance of sections and cadences and underlying harmonic progressions gives way to an emphasis on themes. The clarity of strongly differentiated major and minor sections gives way to a more equivocal sense of key and mode. These changes produce changes in performance practice: when sections are clear, then there is less need to emphasize the points of articulation. When they are less clear, greater importance is placed on varying the tempo during the course of the music to give &quot;shape&quot; to the music.

Over the last half-century, a critical tradition of examining scores, autographs, annotations, and the historical record has changed, sometimes subtly, on occasion dramatically, the way the sonata form is viewed. It has led to changes in how works are edited; for example, the phrasing of Beethoven&#x27;s piano works has undergone a shift to longer and longer phrases that are not always in step with the cadences and other formal markers of the sections of the underlying form. Comparing the recordings of Schnabel, from the beginning of modern recording, with those of Barenboim and then Pratt shows a distinct shift in how the structure of the sonata form is presented to the listener over time.

For composers, the sonata form is like the plot of a play or movie script, describing when the crucial plot points are, and the kinds of material that should be used to connect them into a coherent and orderly whole. At different times the sonata form has been taken to be quite rigid, and at other times a freer interpretation has been considered permissible.

In the theory of sonata form it is often asserted that other movements stand in relation to the sonata-allegro form, either, per Charles Rosen that they are really &quot;sonata forms&quot;, plural—or as Edward T. Cone asserts, that the sonata-allegro is the ideal to which other movement structures &quot;aspire&quot;. This is particularly seen to be the case with other movement forms that commonly occur in works thought of as sonatas. As a sign of this the word &quot;sonata&quot; is sometimes prepended to the name of the form, in particular in the case of the sonata rondo form. Slow movements, in particular, are seen as being similar to sonata-allegro form, with differences in phrasing and less emphasis on the development.

However, Schoenberg and other theorists who used his ideas as a point of departure see the theme and variations as having an underlying role in the construction of formal music, calling the process &quot;continuing variation&quot;, and argue from this idea that the sonata-allegro form is a means of structuring the continuing variation process. Theorists of this school include Erwin Ratz and William E. Caplin.

Subsections of works are sometimes analyzed as being in sonata form, in particular single movement works, such as the &quot;Konzertstück in F minor&quot; of Carl Maria von Weber.

From the 1950s onward, Hans Keller developed a &#x27;two-dimensional&#x27; method of analysis that explicitly considered form and structure from the point of view of &quot;listener expectations&quot;. In his work, the sonata-allegro was a well-implied &#x27;background form&#x27; against whose various detailed features composers could compose their individual &#x27;foregrounds&#x27;; the &#x27;meaningful contradiction&#x27; of expected background by unexpected foreground was seen as generating the expressive content. In Keller&#x27;s writings, this model is applied in detail to Schoenberg&#x27;s 12-note works as well as the classical tonal repertoire. In recent times, two other musicologists, James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy, have presented, without reference to Keller, their analysis, which they term Sonata Theory, of the sonata-allegro form and the sonata cycle in terms of genre expectations, and categorized both the sonata-allegro movement and the sonata cycle by the compositional choices made to respect or depart from conventions. Their study focuses on the normative period of sonata practice, notable ones being the works of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and their close contemporaries, projecting this practice forward to development of the sonata-allegro form into the 19th and 20th centuries.

<text>Copán is an archaeological site of the Maya civilization in the Copán Department of western Honduras, not far from the border with Guatemala. It is one of the most important sites of the Maya civilization, which was not excavated until the 19th century. The ruined citadel and imposing public squares reveal the three main stages of development before the city was abandoned in the early 10th century.

This ancient Maya city mirrors the beauty of the physical landscapes in which it flourished—a fertile, well-watered mountain valley in western Honduras at an elevation of 600 meters (1,970 feet) above mean sea level. It was the capital city of a major Classic period kingdom from the 5th to 9th centuries AD. The city was in the extreme southeast of the Mesoamerican cultural region, on the frontier with the Isthmo-Colombian cultural region, and was almost surrounded by non-Maya peoples.

Copán was occupied for more than two thousand years, from the Early Preclassic period to the Postclassic. The city developed a distinctive sculptural style within the tradition of the lowland Maya, perhaps to emphasize the Maya ethnicity of the city&#x27;s rulers.

The city has a historical record that spans the greater part of the Classic period and has been reconstructed in detail by archaeologists and epigraphers. Copán was a powerful city ruling a vast kingdom within the southern Maya area. The city suffered a major political disaster in AD 738 when Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil, one of the greatest kings in Copán&#x27;s dynastic history, was captured and executed by his former vassal, the king of Quiriguá. This unexpected defeat resulted in a 17-year hiatus at the city, during which time Copán may have been subject to Quiriguá in a reversal of fortunes.

A significant portion of the eastern side of the acropolis was eroded away by the Copán River; the river has since been diverted to protect the site from further damage.

As one of the most important sites in Maya history, and because of its outstanding, well-preserved architecture, Copán was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980, and the site was designated a cultural monument by the Honduran Government in 1982.

==Names==
It is thought likely that the ancient name of Copán was &quot;Oxwitik&quot; (), meaning the &quot;Three Witiks&quot;, although the meaning of the word &quot;witik&quot; itself remains obscure.

==Location==

Copán is in western Honduras close to the border with Guatemala. It lies within the municipality of Copán Ruinas in the department of Copán. It is in a fertile valley among foothills at above mean sea level. The ruins of the site core of the city are from the modern village of Copán Ruinas, which is built on the site of a major complex dating to the Classic period.

In the Preclassic period the floor of the Copán Valley was undulating, swampy and prone to seasonal flooding. In the Early Classic, the inhabitants flattened the valley floor and undertook construction projects to protect the city&#x27;s architecture from the effects of flooding.

Copán had a major influence on regional centres across western and central Honduras, stimulating the introduction of Mesoamerican characteristics to local elites.

==Population==

At the peak of its power in the Late Classic, the kingdom of Copán had a population of at least 20,000 and covered an area of over . The greater Copán area consisting of the populated areas of the valley covered about a quarter of the size of the city of Tikal. It is estimated that the peak population in central Copán was between 6000 and 9000 in an area of , with a further 9,000 to 12,000 inhabitants occupying the periphery—an area of . Additionally, there was an estimated rural population of 3,000 to 4,000 in a area of the Copán Valley, giving an estimated total population of 18,000 to 25,000 people in the valley during the Late Classic period.

==History==
Little is known of the rulers of Copán before the founding of a new dynasty with its origins at Tikal in the early 5th century AD, although the city&#x27;s origins can be traced back to the Preclassic period. After this, Copán became one of the more powerful Maya city states and was a regional power in the southern Maya region. However, it suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of its former vassal state Quirigua in 738, when the long-ruling king Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil was captured and beheaded by Quirigua&#x27;s ruler K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat (Cauac Sky). Although this was a major setback, Copán&#x27;s rulers began to build monumental structures again within a few decades.

The area of Copán continued to be occupied after the last major ceremonial structures and royal monuments were erected, but the population declined in the 8th and 9th centuries from perhaps over 20,000 in the city to less than 5,000. This decrease in population took over four centuries to actually show signs of collapse, showing the stability of this site even after the fall of the ruling dynasties and royal families. The ceremonial center was long abandoned and the surrounding valley home to only a few farming hamlets at the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.

===Rulers===

References to the predynastic rulers of Copán are found in later texts, but none of these texts predate the refounding of Copán in AD 426.

===Predynastic history===
The fertile Copán River valley was long a site of agriculture before the first known stone architecture was built in the region about the 9th century BC. The city was important before its refounding by a foreign elite; mentions of the predynastic history of Copán are found in later texts, but none of these predates the refounding of the city in AD 426. There is an inscription that refers to the year 321 BC, but no text explains the significance of this date. An event at Copán is linked to another event that happened 208 days before in AD 159 at an unknown location that is also mentioned on a stela from Tikal, suggesting that it is a location somewhere in the Petén Basin, possibly the great Preclassic Maya city of El Mirador. This AD 159 date is mentioned in several texts and is linked to a figure known as &quot;Foliated Ajaw&quot;. This same person is mentioned on the carved skull of a peccary recovered from Tomb 1, where he is said to perform an action with a stela in AD 376.

===K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; and K&#x27;inich Popol Hol===

The city was refounded by K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27;, establishing it as the capital of a new Maya kingdom. This coup was apparently organized and launched from Tikal. Texts record the arrival of a warrior named K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; Ajaw who was installed upon the throne of the city in AD 426 and given a new royal name, K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; and the &quot;ochk&#x27;in kaloomte&quot; &quot;Lord of the West&quot; title used a generation earlier by Siyaj K&#x27;ak&#x27;, a general from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan who had decisively intervened in the politics of the central Petén. K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; was probably from Tikal and was likely to have been sponsored by Siyaj Chan K&#x27;awill II, the 16th ruler in the dynastic succession of Tikal. K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; may have legitimized his claim to rulership by marrying into the old Copán royal family, evidenced from the remains of his presumed widow. Bone analysis of her remains indicates that she was local to Copán. After the establishment of the new kingdom of Copán, the city remained closely allied with Tikal. The hieroglyphic text on Copán Altar Q describes the lord being elevated to kingship with the receipt of his royal scepter. The ceremonies involved in the founding of the Copán dynasty also included the installation of a subordinate king at Quiriguá.

A text from Tikal mentions K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; and has been dated to AD 406, 20 years before K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; Ajaw founded the new dynasty at Copán. Both names are likely to refer to the same individual originally from Tikal. Although none of the hieroglyphic texts that mention the founding of the new Copán dynasty describe how K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; arrived at the city, indirect evidence suggests that he conquered the city by military means. On Altar Q he is depicted as a Teotihuacano warrior with goggle eyes and a war serpent shield. When he arrived at Copán he initiated the construction of various structures, including one temple in the talud-tablero style typical of Teotihuacan and another with inset corners and apron moldings that are characteristic of Tikal. These strong links with both the Maya and Central Mexican cultures suggest that he was at least a Mexicanized Maya or possibly even from Teotihuacan. The dynasty founded by king K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; ruled the city for four centuries and included sixteen kings plus a probable pretender who would have been seventeenth in line. Several monuments have survived that were dedicated by K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; and by his heir.

K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; died between AD 435 and AD 437. In 1995 a tomb underneath the talud-tablero Hunal temple was discovered by a team of archaeologists led by Robert Sharer and David Sedat. The tomb contained the skeleton of an elderly man with rich offerings and evidence of battle wounds. The remains have been identified as those of K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; due to their location underneath a sequence of seven buildings erected in his honor. Bone analysis has identified the remains as being those of someone foreign to Copán.
K&#x27;inich Popol Hol inherited the throne of Copán from K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27;, who was his father. He undertook major construction projects with the redesign of the core of Copán. Popol Hol is not the original name of this king but rather a nickname based on the appearance of his Teotihuacan-linked name glyph. K&#x27;inich Popol Hol oversaw the construction of the first version of the Mesoamerican ballcourt at the city, which was decorated with images of the scarlet macaw, a bird that features prominently in Maya mythology. His greatest construction activity was in the area of his father&#x27;s palace, now underlying Structure 10L-16, which he demolished after entombing his father there. He then built three successive buildings on top of the tomb in rapid succession.

===Other early dynastic rulers===
Very little is known about Rulers 3 to 6 in the dynastic succession, although it is known from a fragment of a broken monument reused as construction fill in a later building that one of them was a son of Popol Hol. Ruler 3 is depicted on the 8th-century Altar Q, but his name glyph has broken away. Ku Ix was the 4th ruler in the succession. He rebuilt temple 10L-26 in the Acropolis, erecting a stela there and a hieroglyphic step at its base. Although this king is also mentioned on a few other fragments of sculpture, no dates accompany his name. The next two kings in the dynastic sequence are only known from their sculptures on Altar Q.

B&#x27;alam Nehn (often referred to as Waterlily Jaguar) was the first king to actually record his position in the dynastic succession, declaring that he was seventh in line from K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27;. Stela 15 records that he was already ruling Copán by AD 504. B&#x27;alam Nehn is the only king of Copán to be mentioned in a hieroglyphic text from outside of the southeastern Maya region. His name appears in a text on Stela 16 from Caracol, a site in Belize. The stela dates to AD 534, but the text is not well understood. B&#x27;alam Nehn undertook major construction projects in the Acropolis, building over an early palace with a number of important structures.

Wil Ohl K&#x27;inich, the eighth ruler, is another king known only by his appearance on Altar Q. He was succeeded by Ruler 9 in AD 551, his accession being described on the Hieroglyphic Stairway. He is also depicted on Altar Q even though he ruled for less than two years.
The 10th ruler is nicknamed Moon Jaguar by Mayanists. He was a son of B&#x27;alam Nehn, the 7th ruler. He was enthroned in May 553. His surviving monuments were found in the modern village of Copán Ruinas, which was a major complex during the Classic period. The most famous construction dating to his reign is the elaborate Rosalila phase of Temple 16, discovered entombed intact under later phases of the temple during archaeological tunneling work.

===K&#x27;ak&#x27; Chan Yopaat and Smoke Imix===
K&#x27;ak&#x27; Chan Yopaat was the eleventh dynastic ruler at Copán. He was crowned as king in AD 578, 24 days after the death of Moon Jaguar. At the time of his rule, Copán was undergoing an unprecedented rise in population, with residential land use spreading to all available land in the entire Copán Valley. The two surviving stelae of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Chan Yopaat contain long, hard-to-decipher hieroglyphic texts and are the oldest monuments at the site to survive without being either broken or buried. He reigned for 49 years until his death on 5 February 628. His name is recorded on four stelae erected by his successors, one of which describes a rite performed with relics from his tomb in AD 730, almost a hundred years after his death.

Smoke Imix was crowned 16 days after the death of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Chan Yopaat. He is thought to have been the longest reigning king of Copán, ruling from 628 to 695. He is believed to have been born in AD 612 and to have become king at the age of 15. Archaeologists have recovered little evidence of activity for the first 26 years of his reign, but in AD 652 there was a sudden explosion of monument production, with two stelae being erected in the Great Plaza and a further four in important locations across the Copán Valley. These monuments all celebrated a k&#x27;atun-ending. He also erected a stela at the Santa Rita site away and is mentioned on Altar L at Quiriguá in relation to the same event in 652. It is thought that he was trying to stamp his authority throughout the whole valley after the end of some earlier restriction to his freedom to rule as he wished.

After this sudden spate of activity, Smoke Imix continued to rule until almost the end of the 7th century; he dedicated another nine known monuments and made important changes to the architecture of Copán, including the construction of Structure 2, which closes the northern side of the Great Plaza, and a new version of Temple 26, nicknamed Chorcha. Smoke Imix ruled Copán for 67 years and died on 15 June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to identify him in place of his name on Altar Q. His tomb had already been prepared in the Chorcha phase of Temple 26 and he was buried just two days after his death.

===Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil===

Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil was crowned as the 13th king in the Copán dynasty in July 695. He oversaw both the apogee of Copán&#x27;s achievements and also one of the city&#x27;s most catastrophic political disasters. During his reign, the sculptural style of the city evolved into the full in-the-round sculpture characteristic of Copán. In AD 718, Copán attacked and defeated the unidentified site of Xkuy, recording its burning on an unusual stone cylinder. In AD 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil installed K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat as a vassal on the throne of Quiriguá. Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil was confident enough in his power to rank his city among the four most powerful states in the Maya region, together with Tikal, Calakmul and Palenque, as recorded on Stela A. In contrast to his predecessor, Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil concentrated his monuments in the site core of the Copán; his first was Stela J, dated to AD 702 and erected at the eastern entrance to the city.

He continued to erect a further seven high-quality stelae until AD 736, monuments that are considered masterpieces of Classic Maya sculpture with such mastery of detail that they represent the highest pinnacle of Maya artistic achievement. The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil ritually posed and bearing the attributes of a variety of deities, including B&#x27;olon K&#x27;awiil, K&#x27;uy Nik Ajaw and Mo&#x27; Witz Ajaw. The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple 26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now been lost to the erosion of the Copán River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple 16 within a new phase of construction. He remodelled the ballcourt, then demolished it and built a new one in its place.

Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil had only recently dedicated the new ballcourt in AD 738 when a completely unexpected disaster befell the city. Twelve years earlier he had installed K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat on the throne of Quiriguá as his vassal. By 734 the king of Quiriguá had shown he was no longer an obedient subordinate when he began to refer to himself as &quot;k&#x27;ul ajaw&quot;, &quot;holy lord&quot;, rather than simply as a subordinate lord &quot;ajaw&quot;. K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat appears to have taken advantage of wider political rivalries and allied himself with Calakmul, the sworn enemy of Tikal. Copán was firmly allied with Tikal and Calakmul used its alliance with Quiriguá to undermine Tikal&#x27;s key ally in the south.

Although the exact details are unknown, in April 738 K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat captured Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil and burned two of Copán&#x27;s patron deities. Six days later Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil was decapitated in Quiriguá. This coup does not seem to have physically affected either Copán or Quiriguá; there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. All of this seems to imply that K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. It has been suggested that Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil was attempting to attack another site to secure captives for sacrifice in order to dedicate the new ballcourt when he was ambushed by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.

In the Late Classic, alliance with Calakmul was frequently associated with the promise of military support. The fact that Copán, a much more powerful city than Quiriguá, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul was far enough away from Quiriguá that K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage: Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence. The disaster for Copán had long-lasting consequences; major construction ceased and no new monuments were raised for the next 17 years.

===Later rulers===
K&#x27;ak&#x27; Joplaj Chan K&#x27;awiil was installed as the 14th dynastic ruler of Copán on 7 June 738, 39 days after the execution of Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil. Little is known of his reign due to the lack of monuments raised after Quiriguá&#x27;s surprise victory. Copán&#x27;s defeat had wider implications due to the fracturing of the city&#x27;s domain and the loss of the key Motagua River trade route to Quiriguá. The fall in Copán&#x27;s income and corresponding increase at Quiriguá is evident from the massive commissioning of new monuments and architecture at the latter city, and Copán may even have been subject to its former vassal. K&#x27;ak&#x27; Joplaj Chan K&#x27;awiil died in January 749.
The next ruler was K&#x27;ak&#x27; Yipyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil, a son of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Joplaj Chan K&#x27;awiil. The early period of his rulership fell within Copán&#x27;s hiatus, but later on he began a programme of renewal in an effort to recover from the city&#x27;s earlier disaster. He built a new version of Temple 26, with the Hieroglyphic Stairway being reinstalled on the new stairway and doubled in length. Five life-size statues of seated rulers were installed seated upon the stairway. K&#x27;ak&#x27; Yipyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil died in the early 760s and is likely to have been interred in Temple 11, although the tomb has not yet been excavated.

Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was the next ruler, 16th in the dynasty founded by K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27;, although he appears not to have been a direct descendant of his predecessor. He took the throne in June 763 and may have been only 9 years old. He produced no monumental stelae and instead dedicated hieroglyphic texts incorporated into the city&#x27;s architecture and smaller altars. Texts make an obscure reference to his father but his mother was a noblewoman from distant Palenque in Mexico. He built the platform of Temple 11 over the tomb of the previous king in AD 769 and added a two-storey superstructure that was finished in AD 773. Around AD 776, he completed the final version of Temple 16 over the tomb of the founder. At the base of the temple, he placed the famous Altar Q, which shows each of the 16 rulers of the city from K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; through to Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, with a hieroglyphic text on top describing the founding of the dynasty. By the latter 8th century, the nobility had become more powerful, raising palaces with hieroglyphic benches that were as richly constructed as those of the king. At the same time, local satellites were displaying their own local power, as demonstrated by the ruler of Los Higos erecting his own stela in AD 781. Towards the end of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat&#x27;s reign, the city of Copán was struggling with overpopulation and a lack of local resources, with a distinct fall in living standards among the populace. Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was able to celebrate his second K&#x27;atun in AD 802 with his own monument, but the king&#x27;s participation in the K&#x27;atun ending ceremony of AD 810 was marked at Quiriguá, not at Copán. By this time the city&#x27;s population was over 20,000 and it had long needed to import basic necessities from outside.

The troubled times enveloping Copán at this time are evident from the funerary tomb of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, which bears sculptures of the king performing war dances with spear and shield in hand. The sculpted column from the temple shrine has a hieroglyphic text reading &quot;toppling of the Foundation House&quot; that may refer to the fall of the Copán dynasty. Shortage and disease afflicted the massively overpopulated valley of Copán when its last known king, Ukit Took&#x27;, came to the throne on 6 February 822. He commissioned Altar L in the style of Altar Q but the monument was never finished — one face shows the enthronement of the king and a second face was started but two others were completely blank. The long line of kings at the once great city had come to an end. Before the end, even the nobility had been struck by disease, perhaps because epidemics among the malnourished masses spread to the elite. With the end of political authority at the city the population collapsed to a fraction of what it had been at its height. This collapse of the city-state, which people believe occurred sometime between 800 and 830 AD, was sudden. However, the population continued to persist and even flourish between the years 750 and 900 AD, and then gradually declined soon thereafter. In the Postclassic period the valley was occupied by villagers who stole the stone from the monumental architecture of the city in order to build their simple house platforms.

===Modern history===

The first post-Spanish conquest mention of Copán was in an early colonial period letter dated 8 March 1576. The letter was written by Diego García de Palacio, a member of the Royal Audience of Guatemala, to king Philip II of Spain. French explorer Jean-Frédéric Waldeck visited the site in the early 19th century and spent a month there drawing the ruins. Colonel Juan Galindo led an expedition to the ruins in 1834 on behalf of the government of Guatemala and wrote articles about the site for English, French and North American publications. John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood visited Copán and included a description, map and detailed drawings in Stephens&#x27; &quot;Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatán&quot;, published in 1841. The site was later visited by British archaeologist Alfred Maudslay. Several expeditions sponsored by the Peabody Museum of Harvard University worked at Copán during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the 1892–1893 excavation of the Hieroglyphic Stairway by John G. Owens and George Byron Gordon. The Carnegie Institution also sponsored work at the site in conjunction with the government of Honduras.

The Copán buildings suffered significantly from forces of nature in the centuries between the site&#x27;s abandonment and the rediscovery of the ruins. After the abandonment of the city the Copán River gradually changed course, with a meander destroying the eastern portion of the acropolis (revealing in the process its archaeological stratigraphy in a large vertical cut) and apparently washing away various subsidiary architectural groups, including at least one courtyard and 10 buildings from Group 10L–2. The cut is an important archaeological feature at the site, with the natural erosion having created an enormous cross-section of the acropolis. This erosion cut away a large portion of the eastern part of the acropolis and revealed a vertical cross-section that measures high at its tallest point and long. Several buildings recorded in the 19th century were destroyed, plus an unknown amount of the acropolis that was eroded before it could be recorded. In order to avoid further destruction of the acropolis, the Carnegie Institution redirected the river to save the archaeological site, diverting it southwards in the 1930s; the dry former riverbed was finally filled in at the same time as consolidation of the cut in 1990s. Structures 10L–19, 20, 20A and 21 were all destroyed by the Copán River as it eroded the site away, but had been recorded by investigators in the 19th century.
UNESCO approved funding of US$95,825 between 1982 and 1999 for various works at the site. The cultural monument covers 66 hectares. Looting remains a serious threat to Copán. A tomb was looted in 1998 as it was being excavated by archaeologists.

==Site description==

The Copán site is known for a series of portrait stelae, most of which were placed along processional ways in the central plaza of the city and the adjoining acropolis, a large complex of overlapping step-pyramids, plazas, and palaces. The site has a large court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame.

The site is divided into various groups, with the Main Group and the Cemetery Group in the site core linked by a sacbe to the Sepulturas Group to the northeast. Central Copán had a density of 1449 structures per square kilometer (), while in greater Copán as a whole this density fell to over a surveyed area of .

===Main Group===

The Main Group represents the core of the ancient city and covers an area of . The main features are the Acropolis, which is a raised royal complex on the south side, and a group of smaller structures and linked plazas to the north, including the Hieroglyphic Stairway and the ballcourt. The Monument Plaza contains the greatest concentration of sculpted monuments at the site.

The Acropolis was the royal complex at the heart of Copán. It consists of two plazas that have been named the West Court and the East Court. They are both enclosed by elevated structures. Archaeologists have excavated extensive tunnels under the Acropolis, revealing how the royal complex at the heart of Copán developed over the centuries and uncovering several hieroglyphic texts that date back to the Early Classic and verify details of the early dynastic rulers of the city who were recorded on Altar Q hundreds of years later. The deepest of these tunnels have revealed that the first monumental structures underlying the Acropolis date archaeologically to the early 5th century AD, when K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; established the royal dynasty. These early buildings were built of stone and adobe and were themselves built upon earlier earth and cobble structures dating to the predynastic period. The two styles of building overlap somewhat, with some of the earthen structures being expanded during the first hundred years or so of the dynastic history of the city. The early dynastic masonry buildings of the Acropolis included several with the Early Classic apron-molding style of Tikal and one built in the &quot;talud-tablero&quot; style associated with Teotihuacan, although at the time the &quot;talud-tablero&quot; form was in use at both Tikal and Kaminaljuyu as well as in Central Mexico.

Structure 10L-4 is a platform with four stairways situated by the Monument Plaza.
Structure 10L-11 is on the west side of the Acropolis. It encloses the south side of the Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is accessed from it by a wide monumental stairway. This structure appears to have been the royal palace of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, the 16th ruler in the dynastic succession and the last known king of Copán. Structure 10L-11 was built on top of several earlier structures, one of which probably contains the tomb of his predecessor K&#x27;ak&#x27; Yipyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil. A small tunnel descends into the interior of the structure, possibly to the tomb, but it has not yet been excavated by archaeologists. Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat built a new temple platform over his predecessor&#x27;s tomb in AD 769. On top of this he placed a two-storey superstructure with a sculpted roof depicting the mythological cosmos. At each of its northern corners was a large sculpted Pawatun (a group of deities that supported the heavens). This superstructure had four doorways with panels of hieroglyphs sculpted directly onto the walls of the building. A bench inside the structure, removed by Maudslay in the nineteenth century and now in the British Museum&#x27;s collection, once depicted the king&#x27;s accession to the throne, overseen by deities and ancestors.

Structure 10L-16 (Temple 16) is a temple pyramid that is the highest part of the Acropolis. It is located between the East and West Courts at the heart of the ancient city. The temple faces the West Court within the Acropolis and is dedicated to K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27;, the dynastic founder. The temple was placed on top of the original palace and tomb of the king. It is the final version of a number of temples built on top of each other, as was common practice in Mesoamerica. The earliest version of this temple is nicknamed Hunal; it was built in the talud-tablero style of architecture that was typical of Teotihuacan, with traces of brightly colored murals on the surviving traces of the interior walls. The king was buried in a vaulted crypt that was cut into the floor of the Hunal phase of the building, accompanied by rich offerings of jade. K&#x27;inich Popol Hol, son of the founder, demolished the palace of his father and built a platform on top of his tomb, named Yehnal by archaeologists. It was built in a distinctively Petén Maya style and bore large masks of K&#x27;inich Tajal Wayib&#x27;, the sun god, which were painted red. This platform was encased within another much larger platform within a decade of its construction. This larger platform has been named Margarita and had stucco panels flanking its access stairway that bore entwined images of quetzals and macaws, which both form a part of K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27;s name. The Margarita phase contained a tomb with the richly accompanied burial of an elderly woman nicknamed the &quot;Lady in Red&quot;. It is likely that she was the widow of K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; and the mother of K&#x27;inich Popol Hol. The upper chamber of the Margarita phase temple was converted to receive offerings and the unusual Xukpi stone, a dedicatory monument used in one of the earlier phases, was reused in this later phase.
One of the best preserved phases of Temple 16 is the Rosalila, built over the remains of five previous versions of the temple. Archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia discovered the almost intact shrine while tunneling underneath the final version of the temple. Rosalila is notable for its excellent state of preservation, including the entire building from the base platform up to the roof comb, including its highly elaborate painted stucco decoration. Rosalila features K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; placed at the centre of a mythological tableau, combining the founder of the dynasty with the sky deity Itzamna in avian form. The mythological imagery also includes anthropomorphic mountains, skeletons and crocodiles. Vents in the exterior were designed so smoke from incense being burned inside the shrine would interact with the stucco sculpture of the exterior. The temple had a hieroglyphic stone step with a dedicatory inscription. The stone step is less well preserved than the rest of the building, but a date in AD 571 has been deciphered. Due to the deforestation of the Copán valley, the Rosalila building was the last structure at the site to use such elaborate stucco decoration — vast quantities of firewood could no longer be spared to reduce limestone to plaster. A life-size copy of the Rosalila building has been built at the Copán site museum.

Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil encased the Rosalila phase under a new version of the building in the early 8th century AD. An offering was made as part of the rites to terminate the old phase and included a collection of eccentric flints worked into the profiles of humans and gods, wrapped in blue-dyed textiles, as well as a 5-ft shark brought to the city from the nearest ocean, some 42 km distant.

Structure 10L-18 is on the southeastern side of the Acropolis and has been damaged by the erosion caused by the Copán River, having lost its eastern side. Stairs on the south side of the structure lead down to a vaulted tomb that was looted in ancient times and was probably that of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. It was apparently plundered soon after the collapse of the Copán kingdom. Unusually for Copán, the summit shrine had four sculpted panels depicting the king performing war dances with spear and shield, emphasizing the rising tensions as the dynasty came to its end.
Temples 10L-20 and 10L-21 were probably both built by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil. They were lost to the Copán River in the early 20th century.

Structure 10L-22 is a large building on the north side of the East Court, in the Acropolis, and faces onto it. It dates to the reign of Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil and is the best preserved of the buildings from his rule. The superstructure of the building has an interior doorway with an elaborate sculpted frame and decorated with masks of the mountain god &quot;Witz&quot;. The outer doorway is framed by the giant mask of a deity, and has stylistic similarities with the Chenes regional style of distant Yucatán. The temple was built to celebrate the completion of the king&#x27;s first K&#x27;atun in power, in AD 715, and has a hieroglyphic step with a first-person phrase &quot;I completed my K&#x27;atun&quot;. The building symbolically represents the mountain where maize was created.

Structure 10L-25 is in the East Court of the Acropolis. It covers a rich royal tomb nicknamed Sub-Jaguar by archaeologists. It is presumed to be the tomb of either Ruler 7 (B&#x27;alam Nehn), Ruler 8 or Ruler 9, who all ruled in the first half of the 6th century AD.
Structure 10L-26 is a temple that projects northwards from the Acropolis and is immediately to the north of Structure 10L-22. The structure was built by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil and K&#x27;ak&#x27; Yipyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil, the 13th and 15th rulers in the dynastic succession. The wide Hieroglyphic Stairway ascends the building on the west side from the courtyard below. The earliest version of the temple, nicknamed Yax, was built during the reign of K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27;, the dynastic founder, and has architectural features (such as inset corners) that are characteristic of Tikal and the central Petén region. The next phase of the building was built by Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27;s son K&#x27;inich Popol Hol and is nicknamed Motmot. This phase of the structure was more elaborate and was decorated with stucco. Set under the building was the Motmot capstone, covering a tomb with the unusual Teotihuacan-style burial of a woman, accompanied by a wide variety of offerings that included animal bones, mercury, jade and quartz, along with three severed human heads, all of which were male. Ku Ix built a new phase of the building over Motmot, nicknamed Papagayo.

Smoke Imix demolished the Papagayo phase and ritually interred the broken remains of its sculpted monuments, accompanied by stone macaw heads from an early version of the ballcourt. He then built a pyramid over the earlier phases, nicknamed Mascarón by archaeologists. It in turn was developed into the Chorcha pyramid with the addition of a long superstructure with seven doorways at the front and back. Before a new building was built over the top, the upper sanctuary was demolished and a tomb was inserted into the floor and covered with 11 large stone slabs. The tomb contained the remains of an adult male and a sacrificed child. The adult&#x27;s badly decayed skeleton was wrapped in a mat and accompanied by offerings of fine jade, including ear ornaments and a necklace of sculpted figurines. The burial was accompanied by offerings of 44 ceramic vessels, jaguar pelts, spondylus shells, 10 paintpots and one or more hieroglyphic books, now decayed. There were also 12 ceramic incense burners with lids modeled into human figurines, thought to represent Smoke Imix and his 11 dynastic predecessors. The Chorcha building was dedicated to the long-lived 7th-century king Smoke Imix and it is therefore likely that the remains interred in the building are his. Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil had sealed the Chorcha phase under a new version of the temple, nicknamed Esmeralda, by AD 710. The new phase bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, which contains a lengthy dynastic history. K&#x27;ak&#x27; Yipyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil built over the Esmeralda phase in the mid-8th century. He removed the Hieroglyphic Stairway from the earlier building and reinstalled it into his own version, while doubling the length of its text and adding five life-size statues of rulers dressed in the garb of Teotihuacano warriors, each seated on a step of the stairway. At the base of the stairway, he also raised Stela M, with his own image. The summit shrine of the temple bore a hieroglyphic text composed of full-figure hieroglyphs, each placed beside a similar glyph in faux-Mexican style, giving the appearance of a bilingual text.
The Hieroglyphic Stairway climbs the west side of Structure 10L-26. It is wide and has a total of 62 steps. Stela M and its associated altar are at its base and a large sculpted figure is located in the centre of every 12th step. These figures are believed to represent the most important rulers in the dynastic history of the site. The stairway takes its name from the 2200 glyphs that together form the longest known Maya hieroglyphic text. The text is still being reconstructed, having been scrambled by the collapse of the glyphic blocks when the façade of the temple collapsed. The staircase measures long and was first built by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil in AD 710, being reinstalled and expanded in the following phase of the temple by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Yipyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil in AD 755.

The Ballcourt is immediately north of the Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is to the south of the Monument Plaza. It was remodeled by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil, who then demolished it and built a third version, which was one of the largest from the Classic period. It was dedicated to the great macaw deity and the buildings flanking the playing area carried 16 mosaic sculptures of the birds. The completion date of the ballcourt is inscribed with a hieroglyphic text upon the sloping playing area and is given as 6 January 738.

The Monument Plaza or Great Plaza is on the north side of the Main Group.

===Sepulturas Group===
The Sepulturas Group is linked by a &quot;sacbe&quot; or causeway that runs southwest to the Monument Plaza in the Main Group. The Sepulturas Group consists of a number of restored structures, mostly elite residences that feature stone benches, some of which have carved decorations, and a number of tombs.

The group has a very long occupational history, with one house having been dated as far back as the Early Preclassic. By the Middle Preclassic, large platforms were being built from cobbles and several rich burials were made. By AD 800, the complex consisted of about 50 buildings arranged around 7 major courtyards. At this time, the most important building was the &quot;House of the Bakabs&quot;, the palace of a powerful nobleman from the time of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. The building has a high-quality sculpted exterior and a carved hieroglyphic bench inside. A portion of the group was a subdistrict occupied by non-Maya inhabitants from Central Honduras who were involved in the trade network that brought in goods from that region.

===Other groups===
The North Group is a Late Classic compound. Archaeologists have excavated fallen façades that bear hieroglyphic inscriptions and sculpted decoration.

The Cemetery Group is immediately south of the Main Group and includes a number of small structures and plazas.

===Monuments===


Altar Q is the most famous monument at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD 776 and has each of the first 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the upper surface, relating the founding of the dynasty in AD 426–427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; transferring power to Yax Pasaj. Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that tells us the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells us much about Early Classic Maya culture.

The Motmot Capstone is an inscribed stone that was placed over a tomb under Structure 10L-26. Its face was finely sculpted with portraits of the first two kings of the Copán dynasty, K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; and K&#x27;inich Popol Hol, facing towards each other with a double column of hieroglyphs between them, all contained within a quatrefoil frame. The frame and the hieroglyphic names of mythological locations underneath the feet of the two kings place them in a supernatural realm. The capstone bears two calendrical dates, in AD 435 and AD 441. The second of these is probably the date that the capstone was dedicated.

The Xukpi Stone is a dedicatory monument from one of the earlier phases of the 10L-16 temple constructed to honor K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27;. It bears the date of AD 437 and the names both K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; and K&#x27;inich Popol Hol, together with a possible mention of the Teotihuacan general Siyaj K&#x27;ak&#x27;. The monument has not been completely deciphered and its style and phrasing are unusual. Originally it was used as a sculpted bench or step and the date on the monument is associated with the dedication of a funerary temple or a tomb, probably the tomb of K&#x27;inich&#x27; Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27;, which was discovered underneath the same structure.

Stela 2 was erected in the Great Plaza by Smoke Imix in AD 652.

Stela 3 is another stela erected by Smoke Imix in the Great Plaza in AD 652.

Stela 4 was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil in the early 8th century AD.

Stela 7 dates to the reign of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Chan Yopaat, and was erected to celebrate the K&#x27;atun-ending ceremony of AD 613. It was found in the western complex now underneath the modern village of Copán Ruinas. It bears a long hieroglyphic text that has been only partially deciphered.

Stela 9 was found in the modern village of Copán Ruinas, where it had been erected on the site of a major Classic period complex outside of the site core. It was dedicated by Moon Jaguar and dates to AD 564.

Stela 10 was erected outside of the site core by Smoke Imix in AD 652.

Stela 11 was originally an interior column from Temple 18, the funerary shrine of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. When it was found, it was broken in two parts at the base of the temple. It portrays the king as the elderly Maya maize god and has imagery that seems to deliberately parallel the tomb lid of the Palenque king K&#x27;inich Janaab&#x27; Pakal, probably because of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat&#x27;s close family ties to that city. The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the interior walls of the temple and may describe the downfall of the Copán dynasty.

Stela 12 was erected outside of the site core by Smoke Imix in AD 652.

Stela 13 was erected outside the site core by Smoke Imix in AD 652.

Stela 15 is dated to AD 524, during the reign of B&#x27;alam Nehn. Its sculpture consists entirely of hieroglyphic text, which mentions that king B&#x27;alam Nehn was ruling the city by AD 504.

Stela 17 dates to AD 554, during the reign of Moon Jaguar. It originally stood in the nearby village of Copán Ruinas, which was a major complex in the Classic period.

Stela 18 is a fragment of a monument bearing the name of K&#x27;inich Popol Hol. It was erected in the inner chamber of the 10L-26 temple.

Stela 19 is a monument erected outside of the site core by Smoke Imix in AD 652.

Stela 63 was dedicated by K&#x27;inich Popol Hol. Its sculpture consists purely of finely carved hieroglyphic texts and it is possible that it was originally commissioned by K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; with additional texts added to the sides of the monument by his son. The text contains the same date in AD 435 that appears on the Motmot Capstone. Stela 63 was deliberately broken, together with its hieroglyphic step, during the ritual demolishing of the Papagayo phase of Temple 26. The remains of the monuments were then interred in the building before the next phase was built.

Stela A was erected in 731 by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil. It places his rulership among the four most powerful kingdoms in the Maya region, alongside Palenque, Tikal and Calakmul.

Stela B was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil in the early 8th century AD.

Stela C was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil in the early 8th century AD.

Stela D was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil in the early 8th century AD.

Stela F was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil in the early 8th century AD.

Stela H was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil in the early 8th century AD.

Stela J was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil in AD 702 and was his first monument. It stood at the eastern entrance to the city and is unusual in being topped by a sculpted stone roof, converting the monument into a symbolic house. It bears a hieroglyphic text that is woven into a criss-cross mat design to form a convoluted puzzle that must be read in precisely the right order to be understood.

Stela M bears a portrait of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Yipyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil. It was raised at the foot of the Hieroglyphic Stairway of Temple 26 in AD 756.

Stela N was dedicated by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Yipyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil in AD 761 and placed at the foot of the steps to Temple 11, which is believed to contain his burial.

Stela P was originally erected in an unknown location and was later moved to the West Court of the Acropolis. It bears a long hieroglyphic text that has not yet been fully deciphered. It dates from the reign of king K&#x27;ak&#x27; Chan Yopaat and was dedicated in AD 623.

<text>The Boston Public Library is a municipal public library system in Boston, Massachusetts, founded in 1848. The Boston Public Library is also Massachusetts&#x27; Library for the Commonwealth (formerly &quot;library of last recourse&quot;), meaning all adult residents of the state are entitled to borrowing and research privileges, and the library receives state funding. The Boston Public Library contains approximately 24 million items, making it the third-largest public library in the United States behind the federal Library of Congress and New York Public Library, which is also privately endowed. The Central Library&#x27;s McKim building in Copley Square was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 2000.

==Overview==
Boston Public Library has a collection of more than 23.7 million items, which makes it one of the largest municipal public library systems in the United States. The vast majority of the collection—over 22.7 million volumes—is held in the Central Branch research stacks. Between July 2012 and June 2013, the annual circulation of the BPL was 3.69 million. Because of the strength and importance of its research collection, the Boston Public Library is a member of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), a not-for-profit organization comprising the research libraries of North America. The New York Public Library is the only other public library that is a member of the ARL, and it also has a private endowment. The library has established collections of distinction, based on the collection&#x27;s depth and breadth, including subjects such as Boston history, the Civil War, Irish history, etc. In addition, the library is both a federal and state depository of government documents.

Included in the BPL&#x27;s research collection are more than 1.7 million rare books and manuscripts. It possesses wide-ranging and important holdings, including medieval manuscripts and incunabula, early editions of William Shakespeare (among which are a number of Shakespeare quartos and the First Folio), the George Ticknor collection of Spanish literature, a major collection of Daniel Defoe, records of colonial Boston, the personal 3,800 volume library of John Adams, the mathematical and astronomical library of Nathaniel Bowditch, important manuscript archives on abolitionism, including the papers of William Lloyd Garrison, and a major collection of materials on the Sacco and Vanzetti case. There are large collections of prints, photographs, postcards, and maps. The library, for example, holds one of the major collections of watercolors and drawings by Thomas Rowlandson. The library has a special strength in music, and holds the archives of the Handel and Haydn Society, scores from the estate of Serge Koussevitzky, and the papers of and grand piano belonging to the important American composer Walter Piston.

For all these reasons, the historian David McCullough has described the Boston Public Library as one of the five most important libraries in the United States, the others being the federal Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, and the university libraries of Harvard and Yale.

==History==
===Founding and expansion===

===19th century===
In the mid-19th century, several people were instrumental in the establishment of the Boston Public Library. George Ticknor, a Harvard University professor and trustee of the Boston Athenaeum, proposed establishing a public library in Boston beginning as early as 1826. At the time, Ticknor could not generate enough interest.

In 1839, Alexandre Vattemare, a French philanthropist, suggested that all of Boston&#x27;s libraries combine into one institution for the benefit of the public. The idea was presented to many Boston libraries, however, most were uninterested in the idea. At Vattemare&#x27;s urging, Paris sent gifts of books in 1843 and 1847 to assist in establishing a unified public library. Vattemare made yet another gift of books in 1849.

Josiah Quincy Jr. anonymously donated $5,000 to begin funding a new library. Quincy made the donation while he was mayor of Boston. Indirectly, John Jacob Astor, businessman and philanthropist, also influenced the establishment of a public library in Boston. At the time of his death, Astor bequeathed $400,000 to New York to establish a public library there. Because of the cultural and economic rivalry between Boston and New York, this bequest prompted more discussion of establishing a public library in Boston. In 1848, a statute of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts enabled the creation of the library. The library was officially established in Boston by a city ordinance in 1852. Mayor Benjamin Seaver recommended to the city council that a librarian be appointed. In May 1852 the city council adopted the recommendations of the mayor and Edward Capen was chosen to become Boston Public Library&#x27;s first librarian.

Eager to support the library, Edward Everett collected documents from both houses of Congress, bound them at his own expense, and offered this collection to help establish the new library. At the time of Everett&#x27;s donation, George Ticknor became involved in the active planning for the new library. In 1852, financier Joshua Bates gave a gift of $50,000 to establish a library in Boston. After Bates&#x27; gift was received, Ticknor made lists of what books to purchase. He traveled extensively to purchase books for the library, visit other libraries, and set up book agencies.

To house the collection, a former schoolhouse located on Mason Street was selected as the library&#x27;s first home. On March 20, 1854, the Reading Room of the Boston Public Library officially opened to the public. The circulation department opened on May 2, 1854.

The opening day collection of 16,000 volumes fit in the Mason Street building, but it quickly became obvious that its quarters were inadequate. So in December 1854, the library&#x27;s commissioners authorized the library to move to a new building on Boylston Street. Designed by Charles Kirk Kirby to hold 240,000 volumes, the imposing Italianate edifice opened in 1858. Eventually the library outgrew that building as well; in 1878, an examining committee recommended replacing it with a new one at another location.

In 1870, the library opened the East Boston branch, the first branch library in the United States. With the aim of increasing its reach throughout the city and providing services to residents everywhere, the library opened 21 more branches in Boston neighborhoods between 1872 and 1900.

By 1880, the Massachusetts legislature authorized construction of an even grander library building. A site selected was in Back Bay on Copley Square, the prominent corner of Boylston Street and Dartmouth Street, opposite Richardson&#x27;s Trinity Church and near the first Boston Museum of Fine Arts. After several years of debate over the selection of the architects and architectural style for the new library, in 1887 the prestigious New York firm of McKim, Mead, and White was chosen to design the new library. In 1888, Charles Follen McKim proposed a Renaissance style design based on the Bibliothèque Ste-Geneviève in Paris. The trustees of the library approved, and construction commenced. The vast new reading room was called Bates Hall.

===20th century===
In 1972, the Johnson building opened at the central Copley Square location, adjacent to the McKim building. The addition was designed by American architect Philip Johnson. In 1986, the National Park Service designated the McKim building as a National Historic Landmark.

===21st century===
, the Library has had staffing and funding levels for conservation below that of its peers: the BPL&#x27;s staff of two full-time conservators is significantly less than the thirty-five employed at the New York Public Library. Many colonial records and John Adams manuscripts are brittle, decaying, and so in need of attention that the Library&#x27;s acting Keeper of Rare Books and Manuscripts said that &quot;they are falling apart.&quot;

In 2011, the library completed a strategic plan, the BPL Compass, which featured eight community-identified &quot;Principles for Excellence&quot;. The principles in the plan and all of the related outcomes were the result of a two-year community engagement process for which Boston Public Library received national recognition.

In 2012, the city of Boston spent 1.26% ($27,836,648) of its budget on the library, or $43.74 per person.

In 2013, the library unveiled its Collections of Distinction, an initial group of 18 collections that represent the most outstanding, expansive, and renowned of its holdings. Boston Public Library gives priority to Collections of Distinction with respect to public access, acquisition, digitization, preservation, and staff development.

In fall 2013, the city, in coordination with the library, began a renovation of the Central Library&#x27;s Johnson building. In February 2015, the first phase of renovation opened on the Johnson building&#x27;s second floor, including the new Children&#x27;s Library, Teen Central, a community reading area, and the Adult Reference area. The renovated second floor cost a total of $18 million. The second phase of the Johnson building renovations opened in the summer 2016 and included the first floor, mezzanine, and exterior.

In 2017, the Boston Public Library received joint awards from both the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the American Library Association (ALA) for the Central Library Renovation of its Johnson Building, and for the East Boston Branch.

In 2017, the library had 3,818,883 visitors to all locations; 4,933,786 items borrowed; and 9,839,461 visits to its website. The library also gained 82,911 new library card holders.

In 2019, supporters of the library established a new philanthropic fund: The Fund for the Boston Public Library, announced by Mayor Marty Walsh. It began with a $2.8 million investment by &quot;Bank of America Charitable Foundation, Barr Foundation, The Boston Foundation, Liberty Mutual Foundation, State Street Foundation, Inc. and an anonymous donor.&quot;

=== Presidents ===
==Central Library==
The Boston Central Library is located in Copley Square in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay neighborhood. The central library consists of the McKim Building and the Johnson Building, which are attached and interconnected with interior passageways. The central library as a whole with the two buildings combined contains of space and houses 21 million items in its collections as of 2015.

===McKim building===


The McKim building houses the BPL&#x27;s research collection.

===Johnson building===

Designed by Philip Johnson, this late modernist addition, which predated postmodernist architecture, was built in 1967–1971 and opened in 1972. The Johnson building reflects similar proportions, and is built of the same pink Milford granite as the McKim building.

Upon opening, the Johnson building became the home for the Boston Public Library&#x27;s main circulating collection, which includes works in many languages. It also serves as headquarters for the Boston Public Library&#x27;s 24 branch libraries.

In 2013, the library began a major renovation project on the Johnson building. The first phase of the renovation opened in February 2015. The second phase included renovations to the building&#x27;s first floor, mezzanine, and exterior, and opened in the summer 2016. The $78 million renovation includes a new business innovation center and business library, a radio broadcasting studio for WGBH (FM), a 3D printer, and a café.

===List of databases===
As of August 2017, the library arranges for its patrons access to digital content from several providers:


===Digital partners===
Boston Public Library has two digital partners-in-residence at the Central Library in Copley Square. The first is Internet Archive, a nonprofit digital library that offers permanent access to historical collections in digital format for researchers, historians, and the general public. The Digital Public Library of America provides access to digital content from American libraries, archives, museums, and historical societies.

==Branch library system==
In the latter half of the 19th century, the library worked vigorously to develop and expand its branch library system. Viewed as a means to extend its presence throughout the city, the branch system evolved from an idea in 1867 to a reality in 1870, when the first branch library in the United States was opened in East Boston. The library currently has 25 branches serving diverse populations in the city&#x27;s neighborhoods.

* Chinatown, Boston
**Chinatown Branch, 2 Boylston Street. After lacking a local branch for 60 years, a temporary branch opened in the China Trade Center in February 2018 as a result of community activism. Prior to this, it had been served until the 1950s by a branch on Tyler Street.
*North End, Boston 
** North End Branch, 25 Parmenter Street. A delivery station was first opened in 1882. In 1913 the branch was located at 3A North Bennett Street. In 1965 it moved to its current building, designed by Carl Koch and Associates.
* South End, Boston
** South End Branch, 685 Tremont Street. &quot;Library service was established in the South End in 1877. The Branch was located in the Mercantile Library Association until 1879 when it was moved to the English High School. In 1904 the Branch relocated to 397 Shawmut Avenue and then again in 1923 to the John J. Williams Municipal Building at Shawmut Avenue and West Brookline Street. On June 7, 1971 the South End Branch Library moved to a new building at its present location, which was on the site of the original Mercantile building.&quot;
* West End, Boston
** West End Branch, 151 Cambridge Street. &quot;Library service in the West End was initiated in 1894 with the conversion of the Old West Church on the corner of Cambridge and Lynde Streets to library use. The West End Branch opened in February 1896. The West End Redevelopment Project necessitated closing the Branch in 1960. As part of the project a new building designed by Maginnis, Walsh and Kennedy opened in January 1968.&quot;
* Brighton
** Brighton Branch, 40 Academy Hill Road, Brighton. Branch service in Brighton began when the town was annexed to the city of Boston in 1874 and the Brighton Social Library became part of the Boston Public Library. That year also saw the collection move from the former town hall to a new library building named for James Holton, a prominent Brighton resident. A new branch building opened on the same location in 1969. In 2018, the library reopened after undergoing extensive renovations for almost two years.
** Faneuil Branch, 419 Faneuil Street, Brighton. Located in Oak Square, the art-deco style building replaced a temporary location on nearby Brooks Street in 1931. In 2020, the branch temporarily closed for extensive renovations. It is expected to reopen by the end of 2022 This building is currently under consideration for Boston Landmark status by the Boston Landmarks Commission, but remains closed as of August 2023.
* Allston
