<text>A developing country is a sovereign state with a less developed industrial base and a lower Human Development Index (HDI) relative to other countries. However, this definition is not universally agreed upon. There is also no clear agreement on which countries fit this category. The terms low and middle-income country (LMIC) and newly emerging economy (NEE) are often used interchangeably but refers only to the economy of the countries. The World Bank classifies the world&#x27;s economies into four groups, based on gross national income per capita: high, upper-middle, lower-middle, and low income countries. Least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states are all sub-groupings of developing countries. Countries on the other end of the spectrum are usually referred to as high-income countries or developed countries.

There are controversies over the term&#x27;s use, as some feel that it perpetuates an outdated concept of &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;. In 2015, the World Bank declared that the &quot;developing/developed world categorization&quot; had become less relevant and that they will phase out the use of that descriptor. Instead, their reports will present data aggregations for regions and income groups. The term &quot;Global South&quot; is used by some as an alternative term to developing countries.

Developing countries tend to have some characteristics in common often due to their histories or geographies. For example, they commonly have: lower levels of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, energy poverty, higher levels of pollution (e.g. air pollution, littering, water pollution, open defecation), higher proportions of people with tropical and infectious diseases (neglected tropical diseases), more road traffic accidents, and generally poorer quality infrastructure.

In addition, there are also often high unemployment rates, widespread poverty, widespread hunger, extreme poverty, child labour, malnutrition, homelessness, substance abuse, prostitution, overpopulation, civil disorder, human capital flight, a large informal economy, high crime rates (extortion, robbery, burglary, murder, homicide, arms trafficking, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, kidnapping, rape), low education levels, economic inequality, school desertion, inadequate access to family planning services, teenage pregnancy, many informal settlements and slums, corruption at all government levels, and political instability. Unlike developed countries, developing countries lack rule of law.

Access to healthcare is often low. People in developing countries usually have lower life expectancies than people in developed countries, reflecting both lower income levels and poorer public health. The burden of infectious diseases, maternal mortality, child mortality and infant mortality are typically substantially higher in those countries. The effects of climate change are expected to impact developing countries more than high-income countries, as most of them have a high climate vulnerability or low climate resilience.

Developing countries often have lower median ages than developed countries. Population aging is a global phenomenon, but population age has risen more slowly in developing countries.

Development aid or development cooperation is financial aid given by foreign governments and other agencies to support developing countries&#x27; economic, environmental, social, and political development. If the Sustainable Development Goals which were set up by United Nations for the year 2030 are achieved, they would overcome many problems.

== Terms used to classify countries ==

There are several terms used to classify countries into rough levels of development. Classification of any given country differs across sources, and sometimes, these classifications or the specific terminology used is considered disparaging.

=== By income groups ===

The World Bank classifies the world&#x27;s economies into four groups, based on gross national income per capita calculated using the Atlas method, re-set each year on 1 July:

# low-income countries
# lower-middle income countries
# upper-middle income countries
# high income countries (similar to developed countries)

The three groups that are not &quot;high income&quot; are together referred to as &quot;low and middle income countries&quot; (LMICs). For example, for the 2022 fiscal year, a low income country is defined as one with a GNI per capita less than 1,045 in current US$; a lower middle-income country is one with GNI per capita between 1,046 and 4,095 in current US$; an upper middle-income country is one with GNI per capita between 4,096 and 12,695 in current US$, and a high income country is one with GNI per capita of more than 12,696 in current US$. Historical thresholds are documented.

=== By markets and economic growth ===
The use of the term &quot;market&quot; instead of &quot;country&quot; usually indicates a specific focus on the characteristics of the countries&#x27; capital markets as opposed to the overall economy.

* Developed countries and developed markets
* Developing countries include in decreasing order of economic growth or size of the capital market:
** Newly industrialized countries 
** Emerging markets
** Frontier markets
** Least developed countries (also called less economically developed country)
Under other criteria, some countries are at an intermediate stage of development, or, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) put it, following the fall of the Soviet Union, &quot;countries in transition&quot;: all those of Central and Eastern Europe (including Central European countries that still belonged to the &quot;Eastern Europe Group&quot; in the UN institutions); the former Soviet Union (USSR) countries in Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan); and Mongolia. By 2009, the IMF&#x27;s World Economic Outlook classified countries as advanced, emerging, or developing, depending on &quot;(1) per capita income level, (2) export diversification—so oil exporters that have high per capita GDP would not make the advanced classification because around 70% of its exports are oil, and (3) degree of integration into the global financial system&quot;.

=== By geography ===
Developing countries can also be categorized by geography:
* Small Island Developing States (a group of developing countries that are small island countries which tend to share similar sustainable development challenges: small but growing populations, limited resources, remoteness, susceptibility to natural disasters, vulnerability to external shocks, excessive dependence on international trade, and fragile environments).
* Landlocked Developing Countries (landlocked countries often experience economic and other disadvantages)

=== By other parameters ===
* Heavily indebted poor countries, a definition by a program of the IMF and World Bank
* Transition economy, moving from a centrally planned to market-driven economy
* Multi-dimensional clustering system: with the understanding that different countries have different development priorities and levels of access to resources and institutional capacities and to offer a more nuanced understanding of developing countries and their characteristics, scholars have categorized them into five distinct groups based on factors such as levels of poverty and inequality, productivity and innovation, political constraints and dependence on external flows.

=== By self declaration ===
In general, the WTO accepts any country&#x27;s claim of itself being &quot;developing.&quot; Certain countries that have become &quot;developed&quot; in the last 20 years by almost all economic metrics, still insist to be classified as &quot;developing country,&quot; as it entitles them to a preferential treatment at the WTO, countries such as Brunei, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Macao, Qatar, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates have been cited and criticized for this self-declared status.

== Measure and concept of development ==

Development can be measured by economic or human factors. Developing countries are, in general, countries that have not achieved a significant degree of industrialization relative to their populations, and have, in most cases, a medium to low standard of living. There is an association between low income and high population growth. The development of a country is measured with statistical indices such as income per capita (per person), gross domestic product per capita, life expectancy, the rate of literacy, freedom index and others. The UN has developed the Human Development Index (HDI), a compound indicator of some of the above statistics, to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available. The UN had set Millennium Development Goals from a blueprint developed by all of the world&#x27;s countries and leading development institutions, in order to evaluate growth. These goals ended in 2015, to be superseded by the Sustainable Development Goals.

The concept of the developing nation is found, under one term or another, in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations – for example, theories of decolonization, liberation theology, Marxism, anti-imperialism, modernization, social change and political economy.

Another important indicator is the sectoral changes that have occurred since the stage of development of the country. On an average, countries with a 50% contribution from the secondary sector (manufacturing) have grown substantially. Similarly, countries with a tertiary sector stronghold also see a greater rate of economic development.

== Associated theories ==
The term &quot;developing countries&quot; has many research theories associated with it (in chronological order):

* Modernization theory – to explain the process of modernization within societies
* Dependency theory – the notion that resources flow from a &quot;periphery&quot; of poor and underdeveloped states to a &quot;core&quot; of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former
* Development theory – a collection of theories about how desirable change in society is best achieved.
* Postdevelopment theory – holds that the whole concept and practice of development is a reflection of Western-Northern hegemony over the rest of the world

== Criticisms of the term ==

There is criticism for using the term &quot;developing country&quot;. The term could imply inferiority of this kind of country compared with a developed country. It could assume a desire to develop along the traditional Western model of economic development which a few countries, such as Cuba and Bhutan, choose not to follow. Alternative measurements such as gross national happiness have been suggested as important indicators.

One of the early criticisms that questioned the use of the terms &quot;developing&quot; and &quot;underdeveloped&quot; countries was voiced in 1973 by prominent historian and academic Walter Rodney who compared the economic, social, and political parameters between the United States and countries in Africa and Asia.

There is &quot;no established convention&quot; for defining &quot;developing country&quot;. According to economist Jeffrey Sachs, the current divide between the developed and developing world is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century. The late global health expert Hans Rosling has argued against the terms, calling the concept &quot;outdated&quot; since the terms are used under the prerequisite that the world is divided in rich and poor countries, while the fact is that the vast majority of countries are middle-income. Given the lack of a clear definition, sustainability expert Mathis Wackernagel and founder of Global Footprint Network, emphasizes that the binary labeling of countries is &quot;neither descriptive nor explanatory&quot;. Wackernagel identifies these binary terms of &quot;developing&quot; vs. &quot;developed&quot; countries, or &quot;North&quot; vs. &quot;South&quot;, as &quot;a thoughtless and destructive endorsement of GDP fetish.&quot; Wackernagel and Rosling both argue that in reality, there are not two types of countries, but over 200 countries, all faced with the same laws of nature, yet each with unique features.

The term &quot;developing&quot; refers to a current situation and not a changing dynamic or expected direction of development. Additionally, the term &quot;developing world&quot; is increasingly seen as outdated, suggesting a hierarchy and not accurately reflecting the diverse realities of the encompassed countries. This term includes 135 low- or middle-income countries, covering 84% of the global population, and is criticized for its imprecision. Historical and empirical evidence, like the varied infant mortality rates across these nations, underscores the flaws in a uniform classification. Alternatives such as regional or income-based categories (low-income to high-income) are advocated for, as they align better with the specific contexts of countries, supporting more effective policy formulation.

Since the late 1990s, countries identified by the UN as developing countries tended to demonstrate higher growth rates than those in the developed countries category.

To moderate the euphemistic aspect of the word &quot;developing&quot;, international organizations have started to use the term less economically developed country for the poorest nations – which can, in no sense, be regarded as developing. This highlights that the standard of living across the entire developing world varies greatly.

In 2015, the World Bank declared that the &quot;developing / developed world categorization&quot; had become less relevant, due to worldwide improvements in indices such as child mortality rates, fertility rates and extreme poverty rates. In the 2016 edition of its World Development Indicators (WDI), the World Bank made a decision to no longer distinguish between &quot;developed&quot; and &quot;developing&quot; countries in the presentation of its data, considering the two-category distinction outdated. Accordingly, World Bank is phasing out use of that descriptor. Instead, the reports by Worldbank (such as the WDI and the Global Monitoring Report) now include data aggregations for the whole world, for regions, and for income groups – but not for the &quot;developing world&quot;.

== Related terms ==
The term low and middle-income country (LMIC) is often used interchangeably with &quot;developing country&quot; but refers only to the economy of the countries. Least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states are all sub-groupings of developing countries. Countries on the other end of the spectrum are usually referred to as high-income countries or developed countries.

=== Global South ===
The term &quot;Global South&quot; began to be used more widely since about 2004. It can also include poorer &quot;southern&quot; regions of wealthy &quot;northern&quot; countries. The Global South refers to these countries&#x27; &quot;interconnected histories of colonialism, neo-imperialism, and differential economic and social change through which large inequalities in living standards, life expectancy, and access to resources are maintained&quot;.

=== Third World ===
== Common characteristics ==

=== Government, politics and administration ===
Many developing countries have only attained full self-determination and democracy after the second half of the 20th century. Many were governed by an imperial European power until decolonization. Political systems in developing countries are diverse, but most states had established some form of democratic governments by the early 21st century, with varying degrees of success and political liberty. The inhabitants of developing countries were introduced to democratic systems later and more abruptly than their Northern counterparts and were sometimes targeted by governmental and non-governmental efforts to encourage participation. &#x27;Effective citizenship&#x27; is defined by sociologist Patrick Heller as: &quot;closing [the] gap between formal legal rights in the civil and political arena, and the actual capability to meaningfully practice those rights&quot;.

Beyond citizenship, the study of the politics of cross-border mobility in developing countries has also shed valuable light in migration debates, seen as a corrective to the traditional focus on developed countries. Some political scientists identify a &#x27;typology of nationalizing, developmental, and neoliberal migration management regimes&#x27; across developing countries.

=== Economy ===

Following independence and decolonization in the 20th century, most developing countries had dire need of new infrastructure, industry and economic stimulation. Many relied on foreign investment. This funding focused on improving infrastructure and industry, but led to a system of systemic exploitation. They exported raw materials, such as rubber, for a bargain. Companies based in the Western world have often used the cheaper labor in developing countries for production. The West benefited significantly from this system, but left developing countries undeveloped.

This arrangement is sometimes called neocolonialism, meaning a system in which less-developed countries are taken advantage of by developed countries. It does not necessarily mean that former colonies are still controlled by their former colonizer; it refers to colonial-like exploitation. Developing countries are often helping further develop rich countries, rather than being developed themselves. Several institutions have been established with the goal of putting an end to this system. One of these institutions is the New International Economic Order. They have a &#x27;no-strings-attached&#x27; policy that promotes developing countries remaining or becoming self-sufficient. More specifically, they advocate sovereignty over natural resources and industrialization.

Coalitions of developing nations, like the NIEO, frequently lobby for parity in the world stage. The rise of China might imply the rise of the BRIC countries.

== Common challenges ==

The global issues most often discussed by developing countries include globalisation, global health governance, health, and prevention needs. This is contrasted by issues developed nations tend to address, such as innovations in science and technology.

Most developing countries have these criteria in common:
* High levels of poverty – measured based on GNI per capita averaged over three years. For example, if the GNI per capita is less than US$1,025 (as of 2018) the country is regarded as a least developed country.
*Human resource weakness (based on indicators of nutrition, health, education and adult literacy). 
*Economic vulnerability (based on instability of agricultural production, instability of exports of goods and services, economic importance of non-traditional activities, merchandise export concentration, handicap of economic smallness, and the percentage of population displaced by natural disasters). Among other challenges, developing countries have a higher risk of suffering a balance of payments crisis.

===Urban slums===

According to UN-Habitat, around 33% of the urban population in the developing world in 2012, or about 863 million people, lived in slums. In 2012, the proportion of urban population living in slums was highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (62%), followed by South Asia (35%), Southeast Asia (31%) and East Asia (28%).

The UN-Habitat reports that 43% of urban population in developing countries and 78% of those in the least developed countries live in slums.

Slums form and grow in different parts of the world for many reasons. Causes include rapid rural-to-urban migration, economic stagnation and depression, high unemployment, poverty, informal economy, forced or manipulated ghettoization, poor planning, politics, natural disasters and social conflicts. For example, as populations expand in poorer countries, rural people move to cities in extensive urban migration that results in the creation of slums.

In some cities, especially in countries in Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, slums are not just marginalized neighborhoods holding a small population; slums are widespread, and are home to a large part of urban population. These are sometimes called &quot;slum cities&quot;.

===Violence against women===
Several forms of violence against women are more prevalent in developing countries than in other parts of the world. Acid throwing is associated with Southeast Asia, including Cambodia. Honor killing is associated with the Middle East and the Indian Subcontinent. Marriage by abduction is found in Ethiopia, Central Asia and the Caucasus. Abuse related to payment of bride price (such as violence, trafficking and forced marriage) is linked to parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania.

Female genital mutilation (FGM) is another form of violence against women which is still occurring in many developing countries. It is found mostly in Africa, and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and some other parts of Asia. Developing countries with the highest rate of women who have been cut are Somalia (with 98% of women affected), Guinea (96%), Djibouti (93%), Egypt (91%), Eritrea (89%), Mali (89%), Sierra Leone (88%), Sudan (88%), Gambia (76%), Burkina Faso (76%), and Ethiopia (74%). Due to globalization and immigration, FGM is spreading beyond the borders of Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and to countries such as Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, the U.S., and UK.

The Istanbul Convention prohibits female genital mutilation (Article 38). As of 2016, FGM has been legally banned in many African countries.

According to UN Women facts and figures on ending violence against women, it is estimated that 35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and sexual violence by intimate partners or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives. Evidence shows women who have had experienced physical or sexual intimate partner violence report higher rates of depression, having an abortion and acquiring HIV, compared to women who have not had experienced any physical or sexual violence.

Data from the Middle East and North Africa shows that men who witnessed their fathers against their mothers, and men who experienced some form of violence as children, more likely have reported perpetrating intimate partner violence in their adult relationships.

=== Healthcare and public health ===
The status of healthcare that the general public can access is substantially different between developing countries and developed countries. People in developing countries usually have a lower life expectancy than people in developed countries, reflecting both lower income levels and poorer public health. The burden of infectious diseases, maternal mortality, child mortality and infant mortality are typically substantially higher in those countries. Developing countries also have less access to medical health services generally, and are less likely to have the resources to purchase, produce and administer vaccines, even though vaccine equity worldwide is important to combatting pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
Undernutrition is more common in developing countries. Certain groups have higher rates of undernutrition, including women – in particular while pregnant or breastfeeding – children under five years of age, and the elderly. Malnutrition in children and stunted growth of children is the cause for more than 200 million children under five years of age in developing countries not reaching their developmental potential. About 165 million children were estimated to have stunted growth from malnutrition in 2013. In some developing countries, overnutrition in the form of obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition.

The following list shows the further significant environmentally-related causes or conditions, as well as certain diseases with a strong environmental component:
* Illness/disease (malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, etc.): Illness imposes high and regressive cost burdens on families in developing countries.
* Tropical and infectious diseases (neglected tropical diseases)
* Unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation and hygiene
* Indoor air pollution in developing nations
* Pollution (e.g. air pollution, water pollution)
* Motor vehicle collisions
* Unintentional poisoning
* Non communicable diseases and weak healthcare systems

===Water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH)===

Access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services is at very low levels in many developing countries. In 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that &quot;1 in 3 people, or 2.4 billion, are still without sanitation facilities&quot; while 663 million people still lack access to safe and clean drinking water. The estimate in 2017 by JMP states that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation. The majority of these people live in developing countries.

About 892 million people or 12 percent of the global population, practiced open defecation instead of using toilets in 2016. Seventy-six percent (678 million) of the 892 million people practicing open defecation in the world live in just seven countries. Countries with a high number of people openly defecating are India (348 million), followed by Nigeria (38.1 million), Indonesia (26.4 million), Ethiopia (23.1 million), Pakistan (19.7 million), Niger (14.6 million) and Sudan (9.7 million).

Sustainable Development Goal 6 is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the UN in 2015. It calls for clean water and sanitation for all people. This is particularly relevant for people in developing countries.

===Energy===
In 2009, about 1.4 billion of people in the world lived without electricity. 2.7 billion relied on wood, charcoal, and dung (dry animal dung fuel) for home energy requirements. This lack of access to modern energy technology limits income generation, blunts efforts to escape poverty, affects people&#x27;s health due to indoor air pollution, and contributes to global deforestation and climate change. Small-scale renewable energy technologies and distributed energy options, such as onsite solar power and improved cookstoves, offer rural households modern energy services.

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.

Renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty alleviation by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.

Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita.

=== Pollution ===

==== Water pollution ====
Water pollution is a major problem in many developing countries. It requires ongoing evaluation and revision of water resource policy at all levels (international down to individual aquifers and wells). It has been suggested that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases, and that it accounts for the deaths of more than 14,000 people daily.

India and China are two countries with high levels of water pollution: An estimated 580 people in India die of water pollution related illness (including waterborne diseases) every day. About 90 percent of the water in the cities of China is polluted. As of 2007, half a billion Chinese had no access to safe drinking water.

However, after a series of reforms, China&#x27;s environment began to demonstrate enormous improvements around the 2010s. Under the leadership of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, a sizable fraction of high-pollution industries have been gradually phased out and many illegally polluting factories were sanctioned or closed. A considerable amount of effort went to enforce environmental regulations at regional levels and holding persons of malpractice accountable, including officials and firm managers. The slogan &quot;clear waters and green mountains are as valuable as gold and silver mountains&quot; proposed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2005 signifies China&#x27;s determination in amending environmental burdens created during industrialization while shifting to more sustainable modes of development and adopting high-end industries. Water bodies around the country are much cleaner than a decade ago and steadily approaching natural levels in pollutants.

In 2021, China introduced the &quot;coal to gas&quot; policy as one of many policies directed towards achieving peak carbon emissions in 2060. Coal combustion in homes, power stations and production industries constitutes 60% of total energy consumption in China and is the main source of water and air pollution. It is speculated that pollution sources will be progressively eliminated as China reaches the upper tiers of developing countries.

Further details of water pollution in several countries, including many developing countries:

====Indoor air pollution====
Indoor air pollution in developing nations is a major health hazard. A major source of indoor air pollution in developing countries is the burning of biomass. Three billion people in developing countries across the globe rely on biomass in the form of wood, charcoal, dung, and crop residue, as their domestic cooking fuel. Because much of the cooking is carried out indoors in environments that lack proper ventilation, millions of people, primarily poor women and children face serious health risks.

Globally, 4.3 million deaths were attributed to exposure to IAP in developing countries in 2012, almost all in low and middle income countries. The South East Asian and Western Pacific regions bear most of the burden with 1.69 and 1.62 million deaths, respectively. Almost 600,000 deaths occur in Africa. An earlier estimate from 2000 put the death toll between 1.5 million and 2 million deaths.

Finding an affordable solution to address the many effects of indoor air pollution is complex. Strategies include improving combustion, reducing smoke exposure, improving safety and reducing labor, reducing fuel costs, and addressing sustainability.

===Climate change===
====Particular vulnerability to climate change====

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has confirmed that warming of the climate system due to human intervention is &#x27;unequivocal&#x27;. The effects of climate change will be felt around the globe and will result in events such as extreme weather events, droughts, floods, biodiversity loss, disease and sea level rise, which are dangerous for societies and the environment.

Although 79% of carbon emissions are produced by developed countries, and developing countries have not been the major cause of climate change, they are the most at risk from the effects of these changes and may face challenges in adapting to climate change due to the intersecting issues of high climate vulnerability, low economic status, restricted access to technology, failing infrastructure and limited access to financial resources. Where a country is particularly vulnerable to climate change they are called &quot;highly climate vulnerable&quot;. This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, and Somalia, as well as to Small Island Developing States. In the cases where developing countries produce only small quantities of greenhouse gas emissions per capita but are very vulnerable to the negative effects of global warming, the term &quot;forced riders&quot; as opposed to the &quot;free riders&quot; has been used as a descriptor. Such countries include Comoros, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.

Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012. Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress. A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries. These effects are most severe for the world&#x27;s poorest countries. Internationally there is recognition of the mismatch between those that have caused climate change and those which will suffer the most from climate change, termed &quot;climate justice&quot;. It has been a topic for discussion at some of the United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COP).

&quot;When we think about livelihoods at risk from climate change impacts, we know that people living in developing countries, and especially the least-developed countries and small island states, often have the least financial resources to adapt,&quot; says Nancy Saich, the European Investment Bank&#x27;s chief climate change expert.

====Impacts====
A changing climate also results in economic burdens. The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity. Rising sea levels cost 1% of GDP to the least developed countries in 2010 – 4% in the Pacific – with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the world economy. Another example is the impact on fisheries: approximately 40 countries are acutely vulnerable to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on fisheries. Developing countries with large fisheries sectors are particularly affected. During the Cancún COP16 in 2010, donor countries promised an annual $100 billion by 2020 through the Green Climate Fund for developing countries to adapt to climate change. However, concrete pledges by developed countries have not been forthcoming. Emmanuel Macron (President of France) said at the 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn (COP 23): &quot;Climate change adds further injustice to an already unfair world&quot;. Economic development and climate are inextricably linked, particularly around poverty, gender equality, and energy.

Tackling climate change will only be possible if the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are met, in particular Sustainable Development Goal 13 on climate action.

Climate stress is likely to add to existing migration patterns in developing countries and beyond but is not expected to generate entirely new flows of people. A report by the World Bank in 2018 estimated that around 143 million people in three regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America) could be forced to move within their own countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change. They will migrate from less viable areas with lower water availability and crop productivity and from areas affected by rising sea level and storm surges.

In spite of the cumulative stressors and challenges faced by developing countries in adapting to the effects of climate change, there are those that are world leaders in the field such as Bangladesh. Bangladesh created a national programme in 2009 focused on how the country would adapt to climate change (the first country to do so). It established a fund to support these plans, spending on average $1 billion annually in this regard.

===Population growth===
Over the last few decades, global population growth has largely been driven by developing countries, which often have higher birth rates (higher fecundity rate) than developed countries. According to the United Nations, family planning can help to slow population growth and decrease poverty in these countries.

The violent herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria, the March 2019 attacks against Fulani herders in Mali, the Sudanese nomadic conflicts and other conflicts in the countries of the Sahel region have been exacerbated by climate change, land degradation, and population growth. Droughts and food shortages have been also linked to the Northern Mali conflict.

=== Poor governance ===
Many developing countries are considered flawed democracies or authoritarian regimes by democracy indices such as the V-Dem Democracy indices and Democracy Index (The Economist). Following decolonization and independence, elites have often had oligarchic control of the government.

The establishment of a healthy democratic state has often been challenged by widespread corruption and nepotism and a low confidence and participation in democratic process. Political instability and political corruption are common problems. To fully reach the goal of a low level of corruption, developing countries are usually using special steps for different establishments inside their territories, such as:

* Development or creation of a fair public administration system that is not partially based on corruption and is entirely based on the values and laws of the country
* Better investigation towards the sources of the corruption and probable causes of that particular action
* Publicly informing the residents about the source of corruption and negative influence on the country&#x27;s economy
* Regulation of the official positions of an individual to not be the source of abuse for corruption.
* Creation of special laws dedicated to the corruption itself for specific establishments

=== Others ===
Other common challenges include: Increased and intensified industrial and agricultural production and emission of toxic chemicals directly into the soil, air, and water, unsustainable use of energy resources; high dependency on natural resources for livelihood, leading to unsustainable exploitation or depletion of those resources; child marriage, indebtedness (see Debt of developing countries) and underperforming civil service (see Civil service reform in developing countries), food insecurity, illiteracy and unemployment. The economies of many developing nations are tried to primary products and a majority of their exports go to advanced nations. When advanced nations encounter economic downturns, they can quickly transmit to their developing country trading partners as seen in global economic downturn of 2008–2009.

== Opportunities ==

* Human Capital
* Trade Policy: Countries with more restrictive policies have not grown as fast as countries with open and less distorted trade policies.
* Investment: Investment has a positive effect on growth.
* Education
* Aid for Trade: Included in Sustainable Development Goal 8 under Target 8.a.1 Increase aid for trade is an initiative to help developing countries practice trade and benefit. Aid for trade is to assist developing countries in trade related programmes, prioritize trade and trade capacity, improve trade performance and reduce poverty.
* Global partnership: A provision of Sustainable Development Goal 17 which advocates for international investment and support to achieve innovative technological development, access to market, and fair trade for developing countries.

===Countries and regions that are graduated developed economies ===
The following list, including the Four Asian Tigers and new Eurozone European Union countries (except for Czech Republic), were historically considered developing countries and regions until the 1990s, and are now listed as advanced economies (developed countries and regions) by the IMF. Time in brackets is the time to be listed as advanced economies.

Three economies lack data before being listed as advanced economies. However, because of the lack of data, it is difficult to judge whether they were advanced economies or developing economies before being listed as advanced economies.

== Society and culture ==

=== Media coverage ===
Western media tends to present a generalized view of developing countries through biased media coverage; mass media outlets tend to focus disproportionately on poverty and other negative imagery. This common coverage has created a dominant stereotype of developing countries: &quot;the &#x27;South&#x27; is characterized by socioeconomic and political backwardness, measured against Western values and standards.&quot; Mass media&#x27;s role often compares the Global South to the North and is thought to be an aid in the divide.

Mass media has also played a role in what information the people in developing countries receive. The news often covers developed countries and creates an imbalance of information flow. The people in developing countries do not often receive coverage of the other developing countries but instead gets generous amounts of coverage about developed countries.

<text>Alcippe (; Ancient Greek: Ἀλκίππη &quot;Alkippē&quot;) was a name attributed to a number of figures in Greek mythology.

* Alcippe, daughter of the God of war Ares and mortal princess Aglaulus. 
* Alcippe, an Amazon who vowed to remain a virgin. She was killed by Heracles during his ninth labor.
* Alcippe, mother of Daedalus by Eupalamus, son of Metion. Her other possible children were Metiadusa and Perdix.
* Alcippe, one of the Alcyonides, daughters of the giant Alcyoneus. She was the sister of Anthe, Asteria, Drimo, Methone, Pallene and Phthonia (Phosthonia or Chthonia). When their father Alcyoneus was slain by Heracles, these girls threw themselves into the sea from Kanastraion, which is the peak of Pellene. They were then transformed into halcyons (kingfishers) by the goddess Amphitrite.
* Alcippe, one of the attendants of Helen.
* Alcippe, a princess of Pisa, Elis as the daughter of King Oenomaus and thus, sister of Hippodamia. She married Evenus of Aetolia, the son of Ares and Sterope, by whom she bore a daughter Marpessa.
*Alcippe, Mysian daughter of Poseidon and sister of Astraeus. She was mistakenly deflowered by her brother who after realizing what he had done, flung himself into the river Adurus which bore his name (Astraeus) after the incident. The river was later on called Caicus, from the son of Hermes and Ocyrrhoe.

<text>Halirrhothius (; ) was the Athenian son of Poseidon and Euryte or Bathycleia in Greek mythology. He was also called the son of Perieres and husband of Alcyone who bore him two sons, Serus and Alazygus. Another son of Halirrhothius, Samos of Mantinea was the victor of the four-horse chariot during the first Olympic games established by Heracles.

== Mythology ==

When Halirrhothius raped Alcippe, Ares&#x27;s daughter by Aglaulus, Ares killed him. Ares was then tried for this in a court made up of his fellow gods. The trial was held on a hill adjacent to the Acropolis of Athens, known as the Areopagus. Ares was acquitted. According to the Parian Chronicle this event took place in 1532/1 BC during the reign of Cranaus.

In another version of the myth, Halirrhothius was sent by his father to cut down the olive that had grown out of the spear of Athena. As he raised his axe, it fell out of his hand and mortally wounded him. The olive was called &quot;fatal&quot; (&quot;moros&quot; in Greek, which was used as folk-etymology for moria, the name of the sacred olive trees) from that circumstance. Servius adds that Poseidon was in such great grief of his son&#x27;s passing, that he accused Ares of murder, and the matter was settled on the Areopagus.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, Ceres ( , ) was a goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships. She was originally the central deity in Rome&#x27;s so-called plebeian or Aventine Triad, then was paired with her daughter Proserpina in what Romans described as &quot;the Greek rites of Ceres&quot;. Her seven-day April festival of Cerealia included the popular &quot;Ludi Ceriales&quot; (Ceres&#x27; games). She was also honoured in the May lustration (&quot;lustratio&quot;) of the fields at the Ambarvalia festival: at harvesttime: and during Roman marriages and funeral rites. She is usually depicted as a mature woman.

Ceres is the only one of Rome&#x27;s many agricultural deities to be listed among the Dii Consentes, Rome&#x27;s equivalent to the Twelve Olympians of Greek mythology. The Romans saw her as the counterpart of the Greek goddess Demeter, whose mythology was reinterpreted for Ceres in Roman art and literature.

==Etymology and origins==
The name &quot;Cerēs&quot; stems from Proto-Italic &quot;*kerēs&quot; (&#x27;with grain, Ceres&#x27;; cf. Faliscan &quot;ceres&quot;, Oscan &quot;kerrí&quot; &#x27;Cererī&#x27; &lt; *&quot;ker-s-ēi-&quot; &lt; *&quot;ker-es-ēi-&quot;), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*ḱerh₃-os&quot; (&#x27;nourishment, grain&#x27;), a derivative of the root &quot;*ḱerh₃-&quot;, meaning &#x27;to feed&#x27;.

The Proto-Italic adjective *&quot;keresjo&quot;- (&#x27;belonging to Ceres&#x27;) can also be reconstructed from Oscan &quot;kerríiúí&quot; (fem. &quot;kerríiai&quot;), and Umbrian &quot;śerfi&quot; (fem. &quot;śerfie&quot;). A masculine form *&quot;keres-o&quot;- (&#x27;with grain, Cerrus&#x27;) is attested in Umbrian &quot;śerfe&quot;. The spelling of Latin &quot;Cerus&quot;, a masculine form of &quot;Ceres&quot; denoting the creator (cf. &quot;Cerus manus&quot; &#x27;creator bonus&#x27;, &quot;duonus Cerus&quot; &#x27;good Cerus&#x27;), might also reflect &quot;Cerrus&quot;, which would match the other Italic forms.

Archaic cults to Ceres are well-evidenced among Rome&#x27;s neighbours in the Regal period, including the ancient Latins, Oscans and Sabellians, less certainly among the Etruscans and Umbrians. An archaic Faliscan inscription of c. 600 BC asks her to provide &quot;far&quot; (spelt wheat), which was a dietary staple of the Mediterranean world. Ancient Roman etymologists thought that &quot;ceres&quot; derived from the Latin verb &quot;gerere&quot;, &quot;to bear, bring forth, produce&quot;, because the goddess was linked to pastoral, agricultural and human fertility. Throughout the Roman era, Ceres&#x27; name was synonymous with grain and, by extension, with bread.

==Cults and cult themes==

===Agricultural fertility===
Ceres was credited with the discovery of spelt wheat (Latin &quot;far&quot;), the yoking of oxen and ploughing, the sowing, protection and nourishing of the young seed, and the gift of agriculture to humankind; before this, it was said, man had subsisted on acorns, and wandered without settlement or laws. She had the power to fertilize, multiply and fructify plant and animal seed, and her laws and rites protected all activities of the agricultural cycle. In January, Ceres (alongside the earth-goddess Tellus) was offered spelt wheat and a pregnant sow, at the movable &quot;Feriae Sementivae&quot;. This was almost certainly held before the annual sowing of grain. The divine portion of sacrifice was the entrails &quot;(exta)&quot; presented in an earthenware pot &quot;(olla).&quot; In a rural, agricultural context, Cato the Elder describes the offer to Ceres of a &quot;porca praecidanea&quot; (a pig, offered before harvesting). Before the harvest, she was offered a propitiary grain sample (&quot;praemetium&quot;). Ovid tells that Ceres &quot;is content with little, provided that her offerings are casta&quot; (pure).

Ceres&#x27; main festival, Cerealia, was held from mid to late April. It was organised by her plebeian aediles and included circus games (&quot;ludi circenses&quot;). It opened with a horse-race in the Circus Maximus, whose starting point lay below and opposite to her Aventine Temple; the turning post at the far end of the Circus was sacred to Consus, a god of grain-storage. After the race, foxes were released into the Circus, their tails ablaze with lighted torches, perhaps to cleanse the growing crops and protect them from disease and vermin, or to add warmth and vitality to their growth. From c.175 BC, Cerealia included &quot;ludi scaenici&quot; (theatrical religious events) through April 12 to 18.
====Helper gods====
In the ancient &quot;sacrum cereale&quot; a priest, probably the Flamen Cerialis, invoked Ceres (and probably Tellus) along with twelve specialised, minor assistant-gods to secure divine help and protection at each stage of the grain cycle, beginning shortly before the Feriae Sementivae. W.H. Roscher lists these deities among the &quot;indigitamenta&quot;, names used to invoke specific divine functions.

* Vervactor, &quot;He who ploughs&quot;
* Reparātor, &quot;He who prepares the earth&quot;
* Imporcĭtor, &quot;He who ploughs with a wide furrow&quot;
* Insitor, &quot;He who plants seeds&quot;
* Obarātor, &quot;He who traces the first ploughing&quot;
* Occātor, &quot;He who harrows&quot;
* Serritor, &quot;He who digs&quot;
* Subruncinator, &quot;He who weeds&quot;
* Mĕssor, &quot;He who reaps&quot;
* Convector, &quot;He who carries the grain&quot;
* Conditor, &quot;He who stores the grain&quot;
* Promitor, &quot;He who distributes the grain&quot;

===Marriage, human fertility and nourishment===
In Roman bridal processions, a young boy carried Ceres&#x27; torch to light the way; &quot;the most auspicious wood for wedding torches came from the &quot;spina alba&quot;, the May-tree, which bore many fruits and hence symbolised fertility&quot;. The adult males of the wedding party waited at the groom&#x27;s house. A wedding sacrifice was offered to Tellus on the bride&#x27;s behalf; a sow is the most likely victim. Varro describes the sacrifice of a pig as &quot;a worthy mark of weddings&quot; because &quot;our women, and especially nurses&quot; call the female genitalia &quot;porcus&quot; (pig). Barbette Spaeth (1996) believes Ceres may have been included in the sacrificial dedication, because she is closely identified with Tellus and, as &quot;Ceres legifera&quot; (law-bearer), she &quot;bears the laws&quot; of marriage. In the most solemn form of marriage, &quot;confarreatio&quot;, the bride and groom shared a cake made of far, the ancient wheat-type particularly associated with Ceres.

From at least the mid-republican era, an official, joint cult to Ceres and Proserpina reinforced Ceres&#x27; connection with Roman ideals of female virtue. The promotion of this cult coincides with the rise of a plebeian nobility, an increased birthrate among plebeian commoners, and a fall in the birthrate among patrician families. The late Republican &quot;Ceres Mater&quot; (Mother Ceres) is described as &quot;genetrix&quot; (progenitress) and &quot;alma&quot; (nourishing); in the early Imperial era she becomes an Imperial deity, and receives joint cult with Ops Augusta, Ceres&#x27; own mother in Imperial guise and a bountiful genetrix in her own right. Several of Ceres&#x27; ancient Italic precursors are connected to human fertility and motherhood; the Pelignan goddess &quot;Angitia Cerealis&quot; has been identified with the Roman goddess Angerona (associated with childbirth).

===Laws===
Ceres was patron and protector of plebeian laws, rights and Tribunes. Her Aventine Temple served the plebeians as cult centre, legal archive, treasury and possibly law-court; its foundation was contemporaneous with the passage of the Lex Sacrata, which established the office and person of plebeian aediles and tribunes as inviolate representatives of the Roman people. Tribunes were legally immune to arrest or threat, and the lives and property of those who violated this law were forfeit to Ceres. 

The Lex Hortensia of 287 BC extended plebeian laws to the city and all its citizens. The official decrees of the Senate (&quot;senatus consulta&quot;) were placed in Ceres&#x27; Temple, under the guardianship of the goddess and her aediles. Livy puts the reason bluntly: the consuls could no longer seek advantage for themselves by arbitrarily tampering with the laws of Rome. The Temple might also have offered asylum for those threatened with arbitrary arrest by patrician magistrates. Ceres&#x27; temple, games and cult were at least part-funded by fines imposed on those who offended the laws placed under her protection; the poet Vergil later calls her &quot;legifera Ceres&quot; (Law-bearing Ceres), a translation of Demeter&#x27;s Greek epithet, &quot;thesmophoros&quot;.

As Ceres&#x27; first plough-furrow opened the earth (Tellus&#x27; realm) to the world of men and created the first field and its boundary, her laws determined the course of settled, lawful, civilised life. Crimes against fields and harvest were crimes against the people and their protective deity. Landowners who allowed their flocks to graze on public land were fined by the plebeian aediles, on behalf of Ceres and the people of Rome. Ancient laws of the Twelve Tables forbade the magical charming of field crops from a neighbour&#x27;s field into one&#x27;s own, and invoked the death penalty for the illicit removal of field boundaries. An adult who damaged or stole field-crops should be hanged &quot;for Ceres&quot;. Any youth guilty of the same offense was to be whipped or fined double the value of damage.

=== Poppies ===
Ceres&#x27; signs and iconography, like Demeter&#x27;s from early Mycenae onwards, include poppies - symbolic of fertility, sleep, death and rebirth. Poppies readily grow on soil disturbed by ploughing, as in wheatfields, and bear innumerable tiny seeds. They were raised as a crop by Greek and Roman farmers, partly for their fibrous stems and for the food value of their seeds Where the poppy capsule alone is shown, this probably belongs to the opium poppy (&quot;papaver somniferum&quot;, the &quot;sleep-bearing poppy&quot;). The Roman poet Vergil, in &quot;Georgics&quot;, 1.212, describes this as &quot;Cereale papaver&quot;, or &quot;Ceres&#x27; poppy&quot;, which eases pain and brings sleep - the deepest sleep of all being death. Poppies are often woven into Ceres&#x27; wheat-stalk crown, the &quot;corona spicea&quot;, worn by her priestesses and devotees.

=== Funerals ===

Ceres maintained the boundaries between the realms of the living and the dead, and was an essential presence at funerals. Given acceptable rites and sacrifice, she helped the deceased into the afterlife as an underworld shade, or deity (Di Manes). Those whose death was premature, unexpected or untimely were thought to remain in the upper world, and haunt the living as a wandering, vengeful ghost (Lemur). They could be exorcised, but only when their death was reasonably due. For her service at burials or cremations, well-off families offered Ceres sacrifice of a pig. The poor could offer wheat, flowers, and a libation. The expected afterlife for the exclusively female initiates in the &quot;sacra Cereris&quot; may have been somewhat different; they were offered &quot;a method of living&quot; and of &quot;dying with better hope&quot;.
===The &quot;mundus&quot; of Ceres===
The &quot;mundus cerialis&quot; or &quot;Caereris mundus&quot; (&quot;the world of Ceres&quot;) was a hemispherical pit or underground vault in Rome, now lost. It was usually sealed by a stone lid known as the &quot;lapis manalis&quot;. On August 24, October 5 and November 8, it was opened with the official announcement (&quot;the &quot;mundus&quot; is open&quot;) and offerings were made there to agricultural or underworld deities, including Ceres as goddess of the fruitful earth and guardian of its underworld portals. Its opening offered the spirits of the dead temporary leave from the underworld to roam lawfully among the living, in what Warde Fowler describes as &#x27;holidays, so to speak, for the ghosts&#x27;. The days when the mundus was open were among the very few occasions that Romans made official contact with the collective spirits of the dead, the &quot;Di Manes&quot; (the others being Parentalia and Lemuralia). This possibly secondary or late function of the &quot;mundus&quot; is first attested in the Late Republican Era, by Varro. The jurist Cato understood the shape of the &quot;mundus&quot; as a reflection or inversion of the dome of the upper heavens. Di Luzio observes that the Roman &quot;mundus&quot; shared functional and conceptual similarities with certain types of underground &quot;pit altar&quot; or megaron, used in Demeter&#x27;s Thesmophoria. 

Roman tradition held that the &quot;mundus&quot; had been dug and sealed by Romulus as part of Rome&#x27;s foundation; Plutarch compares it to pits dug by Etruscan colonists, containing soil brought from their parent city, used to dedicate the first fruits of the harvest. Warde Fowler speculates the &quot;mundus&quot; as Rome&#x27;s first storehouse (&quot;penus&quot;) for seed-grain, later becoming the symbolic &quot;penus&quot; of the Roman state. In the oldest known Roman calendar, the days of the &quot;mundus&quot; are marked as C(omitiales) (days when the Comitia met). Later authors mark them as &quot;dies religiosus&quot; (when no official meetings could be held). Some modern scholars seek to explain this as the later introduction and accommodation of Greek elements, grafted onto the original &quot;mundus&quot; rites. The rites of August 24 were held between the agricultural festivals of Consualia and Opiconsivia; those of October 5 followed the &quot;Ieiunium Cereris&quot;, and those of November 8 took place during the Plebeian Games. As a whole, the various days of the &quot;mundus&quot; suggest rites to Ceres as the guardian deity of seed-corn in the establishment of cities, and as a door-warden of the afterlife, which was co-ruled during the winter months by her daughter Proserpina, queen-companion to Dis.

===Expiations===
In Roman theology, prodigies were abnormal phenomena that manifested divine anger at human impiety. In Roman histories, prodigies cluster around perceived or actual threats to the Roman state, in particular, famine, war and social disorder, and are expiated as matters of urgency. The establishment of Ceres&#x27; Aventine cult has itself been interpreted as an extraordinary expiation after the failure of crops and consequent famine. In Livy&#x27;s history, Ceres is among the deities placated after a remarkable series of prodigies that accompanied the disasters of the Second Punic War: during the same conflict, a lightning strike at her temple was expiated. A fast in her honour is recorded for 191 BC, to be repeated at 5-year intervals. After 206, she was offered at least 11 further official expiations. Many of these were connected to famine and manifestations of plebeian unrest, rather than war. From the Middle Republic onwards, expiation was increasingly addressed to her as mother to Proserpina. The last known followed Rome&#x27;s Great Fire of 64 AD. The cause or causes of the fire remained uncertain, but its disastrous extent was taken as a sign of offense against Juno, Vulcan, and Ceres-with-Proserpina, who were all given expiatory cult. Champlin (2003) perceives the expiations to Vulcan and Ceres in particular as attempted populist appeals by the ruling emperor, Nero.

==Myths and theology==

The complex and multi-layered origins of the Aventine Triad and Ceres herself allowed multiple interpretations of their relationships, beyond the humanised pattern of relations within the Triad; while Cicero asserts Ceres as mother to both Liber and Libera, consistent with her role as a mothering deity, Varro&#x27;s more complex theology groups her functionally with Tellus, Terra, Venus (and thus Victoria) and with Libera as a female aspect of Liber. No native Roman myths of Ceres are known. According to &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;, by which Roman deities were identified with their Greek counterparts, she was an equivalent to Demeter, one of the Twelve Olympians of Greek religion and mythology; this made Ceres one of Rome&#x27;s twelve Di Consentes, daughter of Saturn and Ops, sister of Jupiter, mother of Proserpina by Jupiter and sister of Juno, Vesta, Neptune and Dis. Ceres&#x27; known mythology is indistinguishable from Demeter&#x27;s:
Ovid likens Ceres&#x27; devotion to her own offspring to that of a cow to its calf; but she is also the originator of bloody animal sacrifice, a necessity in the renewal of life. She has a particular enmity towards her own sacrificial animal, the pig. Pigs offend her by their destructive rooting-up of field crops under her protection; and in the myth of Proserpina&#x27;s abduction on the plains of Henna (Enna), her tracks were obscured by their trampling. If not for them, Ceres might have been spared the toils and grief of her lengthy search and separation, and humankind would have been spared the consequent famine. The myth is also a reminder that the gift of agriculture is a contract, and comes at a price. It brings well-being but also mortality. Enna, in Sicily, had strong mythological connections with Ceres and Proserpina, and was the site of Ceres most ancient sanctuary. Flowers were said to bloom throughout the year on its &quot;miraculous plain&quot;.

==Temples==
Vitruvius (c.80 – 15 BC) describes the &quot;Temple of Ceres near the Circus Maximus&quot; (her Aventine Temple) as typically Araeostyle, having widely spaced supporting columns, with architraves of wood, rather than stone. This species of temple is &quot;clumsy, heavy roofed, low and wide, [its] pediments ornamented with statues of clay or brass, gilt in the Tuscan fashion&quot;. He recommends that temples to Ceres be sited in rural areas: &quot;in a solitary spot out of the city, to which the public are not necessarily led but for the purpose of sacrificing to her. This spot is to be reverenced with religious awe and solemnity of demeanour, by those whose affairs lead them to visit it.&quot; During the early Imperial era, soothsayers advised Pliny the Younger to restore an ancient, &quot;old and narrow&quot; temple to Ceres, at his rural property near Como. It contained an ancient wooden cult statue of the goddess, which he replaced. Though this was an unofficial and privately funded cult (&quot;sacra privata&quot;), its annual feast on the Ides of September was attended by pilgrims from all over the region; this feast was also the same day as the Epulum Jovis. Pliny considered this rebuilding a fulfillment of his civic and religious duty.

===Images of Ceres===
No images of Ceres survive from her pre-Aventine cults; the earliest date to the middle Republic, and show the Hellenising influence of Demeter&#x27;s iconography. Some late Republican images recall Ceres&#x27; search for Proserpina. Ceres bears a torch, sometimes two, and rides in a chariot drawn by snakes; or she sits on the sacred &quot;kiste&quot; (chest) that conceals the objects of her mystery rites. Sometimes she holds a caduceus, a symbol of Pax (Roman goddess of Peace). Augustan reliefs show her emergence, plant-like from the earth, her arms entwined by snakes, her outstretched hands bearing poppies and wheat, or her head crowned with fruits and vines. In free-standing statuary, she commonly wears a wheat-crown, or holds a wheat spray. Moneyers of the Republican era use Ceres&#x27; image, wheat ears and garlands to advertise their connections with prosperity, the annona and the popular interest. Some Imperial coin images depict important female members of the Imperial family as Ceres, or with some of her attributes.

==Priesthoods==
Ceres was served by several public priesthoods. Some were male; her senior priest, the &quot;flamen cerialis&quot;, also served Tellus and was usually plebeian by ancestry or adoption. Her public cult at the Ambarvalia, or &quot;perambulation of fields&quot; identified her with Dea Dia, and was led by the Arval Brethren (&quot;The Brothers of the Fields&quot;); rural versions of these rites were led as private cult by the heads of households. An inscription at Capua names a male &quot;sacerdos Cerialis mundalis&quot;, a priest dedicated to Ceres&#x27; rites of the &quot;mundus&quot;. The plebeian aediles had minor or occasional priestly functions at Ceres&#x27; Aventine Temple and were responsible for its management and financial affairs including collection of fines, the organisation of &quot;ludi Cerealia&quot; and probably the Cerealia itself. Their &quot;cure&quot; (care and jurisdiction) included, or came to include, the grain supply (&quot;annona&quot;) and later the plebeian grain doles (&quot;frumentationes&quot;), the organisation and management of public games in general, and the maintenance of Rome&#x27;s streets and public buildings.

Otherwise, in Rome and throughout Italy, as at her ancient sanctuaries of Henna and Catena, Ceres&#x27; &quot;ritus graecus&quot; and her joint cult with Proserpina were invariably led by female &quot;sacerdotes&quot;, drawn from local and Roman elites: Cicero notes that once the new cult had been founded, its earliest priestesses &quot;generally were either from Naples or Velia&quot;, cities allied or federated to Rome. Elsewhere, he describes Ceres&#x27; Sicilian priestesses as &quot;older women respected for their noble birth and character&quot;. Celibacy may have been a condition of their office; sexual abstinence was, according to Ovid, required of those attending Ceres&#x27; major, nine-day festival. Her public priesthood was reserved to respectable matrons, be they married, divorced or widowed. The process of their selection and their relationship to Ceres&#x27; older, entirely male priesthood is unknown; but they far outnumbered her few male priests, and would have been highly respected and influential figures in their own communities.

==Cult development==

===Archaic and Regal eras===
Roman tradition credited Ceres&#x27; eponymous festival, Cerealia, to Rome&#x27;s second king, the semi-legendary Numa. Ceres&#x27; senior, male priesthood was a minor flaminate whose establishment and rites were supposedly also innovations of Numa. Her affinity and joint cult with Tellus, also known as Terra Mater (Mother Earth) may have developed at this time. Much later, during the early Imperial era, Ovid describes these goddesses as &quot;partners in labour&quot;; Ceres provides the &quot;cause&quot; for the growth of crops, while Tellus provides them a place to grow.

===Republican era===

====Ceres and the Aventine Triad====
In 496 BC, against a background of economic recession and famine in Rome, imminent war against the Latins and a threatened secession by Rome&#x27;s plebs (citizen commoners), the dictator A. Postumius vowed a temple to Ceres, Liber and Libera on or near the Aventine Hill. The famine ended and Rome&#x27;s plebeian citizen-soldiery co-operated in the conquest of the Latins. Postumius&#x27; vow was fulfilled in 493 BC: Ceres became the central deity of the new Triad, housed in a new-built Aventine temple. She was also – or became – the patron goddess of the &quot;plebs&quot;, whose enterprise as tenant farmers, estate managers, agricultural factors and importers was a mainstay of Roman agriculture.

Much of Rome&#x27;s grain was imported from territories of Magna Graecia, particularly from Sicily, which later Roman mythographers describe as Ceres&#x27; &quot;earthly home&quot;. Writers of the late Roman Republic and early Empire describe Ceres&#x27; Aventine temple and rites as conspicuously Greek. In modern scholarship, this is taken as further evidence of long-standing connections between the plebeians, Ceres and Magna Graecia. It also raises unanswered questions on the nature, history and character of these associations: the Triad itself may have been a self-consciously Roman cult formulation based on Greco-Italic precedents. When a new form of Cerean cult was officially imported from Magna Graecia, it was known as the &quot;ritus graecus&quot; (Greek rite) of Ceres, and was distinct from her older Roman rites.

The older forms of Aventine rites to Ceres remain uncertain. Most Roman cults were led by men, and the officiant&#x27;s head was covered by a fold of his toga. In the Roman &quot;ritus graecus&quot;, a male celebrant wore Greek-style vestments, and remained bareheaded before the deity, or else wore a wreath. While Ceres&#x27; original Aventine cult was led by male priests, her &quot;Greek rites&quot; (&quot;ritus graecus Cereris&quot;) were exclusively female.

===Middle Republic===
====Ceres and Proserpina====
Towards the end of the Second Punic War, around 205 BC, an officially recognised joint cult to Ceres and her daughter Proserpina was brought to Rome from Southern Italy (part of Magna Graecia) along with Greek priestesses to serve it. In Rome, this was known as the &quot;ritus graecus Cereris&quot;; its priestesses were granted Roman citizenship so that they could pray to the gods &quot;with a foreign and external knowledge, but with a domestic and civil intention&quot;; the recruitment of respectable matrons seems to acknowledge the civic value of the cult. It was based on ancient, ethnically Greek cults to Demeter, most notably the Thesmophoria to Demeter and Persephone, whose cults and myths also provided a basis for the Eleusinian mysteries.

From the end of the 3rd century BC, Demeter&#x27;s temple at Enna, in Sicily, was acknowledged as Ceres&#x27; oldest, most authoritative cult centre, and Libera was recognised as Proserpina, Roman equivalent to Demeter&#x27;s daughter Persephone. Their joint cult recalls Demeter&#x27;s search for Persephone, after the latter&#x27;s abduction into the underworld by Hades. The new, women-only cult to &quot;mother and maiden&quot; took its place alongside the old; it made no reference to Liber. Thereafter, Ceres was offered two separate and distinctive forms of official cult at the Aventine. Both might have been supervised by the male flamen Cerialis but otherwise, their relationship is unclear. The older form of cult included both men and women, and probably remained a focus for plebeian political identity and discontent. The new form identified its exclusively females initiates and priestesses as upholders of Rome&#x27;s traditional, patrician-dominated social hierarchy and morality.

====Ceres and Magna Mater====
A year after the import of the &quot;ritus cereris&quot;, patrician senators imported cult to the Greek goddess Cybele and established her as Magna Mater (The Great Mother) within Rome&#x27;s sacred boundary, facing the Aventine Hill. Like Ceres, Cybele was a form of Graeco-Roman earth goddess. Unlike her, she had mythological ties to Troy, and thus to the Trojan prince Aeneas, mythological ancestor of Rome&#x27;s founding father and first patrician Romulus. The establishment of official Roman cult to Magna Mater coincided with the start of a new &quot;saeculum&quot; (cycle of years). It was followed by Hannibal&#x27;s defeat, the end of the Second Punic War and an exceptionally good harvest. Roman victory and recovery could therefore be credited to Magna Mater and patrician piety: so the patricians dined her and each other at her festival banquets. In similar fashion, the plebeian nobility underlined their claims to Ceres. Up to a point, the two cults reflected a social and political divide, but when certain prodigies were interpreted as evidence of Ceres&#x27; displeasure, the senate appeased her with a new festival, the &quot;ieiunium Cereris&quot; (&quot;fast of Ceres&quot;).

In 133 BC, the plebeian noble and tribune Tiberius Gracchus bypassed the Senate and appealed directly to the popular assembly to pass his proposed land-reforms. Civil unrest spilled into violence; Gracchus and many of his supporters were murdered by their conservative opponents. At the behest of the Sibylline oracle, the senate sent the quindecimviri to Ceres&#x27; ancient cult centre at Henna in Sicily, the goddess&#x27; supposed place of origin and earthly home. Some kind of religious consultation or propitiation was given, either to expiate Gracchus&#x27; murder – as later Roman sources would claim – or to justify it as the lawful killing of a would-be king or demagogue, a &quot;homo sacer&quot; who had offended Ceres&#x27; laws against tyranny.

===Late Republic===
The Eleusinian mysteries became increasingly popular during the late Republic. Early Roman initiates at Eleusis in Greece included Sulla and Cicero; thereafter many Emperors were initiated, including Hadrian, who founded an Eleusinian cult centre in Rome itself. In Late Republican politics, aristocratic traditionalists and popularists used coinage to propagate their competing claims to Ceres&#x27; favour. A coin of Sulla shows Ceres on one side, and on the other a ploughman with yoked oxen: the images, accompanied by the legend &quot;conditor&quot; (&quot;he who stores the grain&quot;) claim his rule (a military dictatorship) as regenerative and divinely justified. Popularists used her name and attributes to appeal their guardianship of plebeian interests, particularly the &quot;annona&quot; and &quot;frumentarium&quot;; and plebeian nobles and aediles used them to point out their ancestral connections with plebeians as commoners. In the decades of Civil War that ushered in the Empire, such images and dedications proliferate on Rome&#x27;s coinage: Julius Caesar, his opponents, his assassins and his heirs alike claimed the favour and support of Ceres and her plebeian proteges, with coin issues that celebrate Ceres, &quot;Libertas&quot; (liberty) and Victoria (victory).

===Imperial era===

Imperial theology conscripted Rome&#x27;s traditional cults as the divine upholders of Imperial Pax (peace) and prosperity, for the benefit of all. The emperor Augustus began the restoration of Ceres&#x27; Aventine Temple; his successor Tiberius completed it. Of the several figures on the Augustan Ara Pacis, one doubles as a portrait of the Empress Livia, who wears Ceres&#x27; &quot;corona spicea&quot;. Another has been variously identified in modern scholarship as Tellus, Venus, Pax or Ceres, or in Spaeth&#x27;s analysis, a deliberately broad composite of them all.

The emperor Claudius&#x27; reformed the grain supply and created its embodiment as an Imperial goddess, Annona, a junior partner to Ceres and the Imperial family. The traditional, Cerean virtues of provision and nourishment were symbolically extended to Imperial family members; some coinage shows Claudius&#x27; mother Antonia as an Augusta, wearing the &quot;corona spicea&quot;.
The relationship between the reigning emperor, empress and Ceres was formalised in titles such as Augusta mater agrorum (&quot;The august mother of the fields) and &quot;Ceres Augusta&quot;. On coinage, various emperors and empresses wear her &quot;corona spicea&quot;, showing that the goddess, the emperor and his spouse are conjointly responsible for agricultural prosperity and the all-important provision of grain. A coin of Nerva (reigned AD 96–98) acknowledges Rome&#x27;s dependence on the princeps&#x27; gift of &quot;frumentio&quot; (corn dole) to the masses. Under Nerva&#x27;s later dynastic successor Antoninus Pius, Imperial theology represents the death and apotheosis of the Empress Faustina the Elder as Ceres&#x27; return to Olympus by Jupiter&#x27;s command. Even then, &quot;her care for mankind continues and the world can rejoice in the warmth of her daughter Proserpina: in Imperial flesh, Proserpina is Faustina the Younger&quot;, empress-wife of Pius&#x27; successor Marcus Aurelius.

In Britain, a soldier&#x27;s inscription of the 2nd century AD attests to Ceres&#x27; role in the popular syncretism of the times. She is &quot;the bearer of ears of corn&quot;, the &quot;Syrian Goddess&quot;, identical with the universal heavenly Mother, the Magna Mater and Virgo, virgin mother of the gods. She is peace and virtue, and inventor of justice: she weighs &quot;Life and Right&quot; in her scale.

During the Late Imperial era, Ceres gradually &quot;slips into obscurity&quot;; the last known official association of the Imperial family with her symbols is a coin issue of Septimius Severus (AD 193–211), showing his empress, Julia Domna, in the &quot;corona spicea&quot;. After the reign of Claudius Gothicus, no coinage shows Ceres&#x27; image. Even so, an initiate of her mysteries is attested in the 5th century AD, after the official abolition of all non-Christian cults.

==Legacy==

The word cereal derives from Ceres&#x27; association with edible grains. Whereas Ceres represents food, her son Liber (later indistinguishable from Bacchus) represents wine and &quot;good living&quot;. The Roman comedian Terence (c. 195/185 – c. 159 BC) uses the line &quot;sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus&quot; which at its simplest translates as &quot;without food and drink, love freezes&quot; or &quot;love needs food and wine to thrive&quot; - probably proverbial and widespread in his own day. It was adopted variously as a brewer&#x27;s motto, celebration, warning, and a subject of art in Renaissance Europe, especially the north and the Dutch Republic. Ceres represented the grains that produced beer through the brewing process. Imagery that represented the profitable business of commercial brewing showed the grain-goddess as a respectable matron and Liber-Bacchus as a gentleman; a wholesome picture of moral sobriety and restraint. 

Ceres is featured both as a goddess and Queen of Sicilly in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162 and notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

Ceres appears briefly to bless the wedding of Ferdinand and Miranda, in a masque at the ending of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1611).

In 1801, a newly discovered dwarf planet or asteroid was named after her. Two years later, the newly discovered element Cerium was named after the dwarf planet. 

An aria in praise of Ceres is sung in Act 4 of the opera &quot;The Trojans&quot; (first performance 1863) by Hector Berlioz.

A misanthropic poem recited by Dmitri in Dostoevsky&#x27;s 1880 novel &quot;The Brothers Karamazov, (part 1, Book 3, chapter 3)&quot; reflects on Ceres&#x27; heartbroken search for her lost daughter, and her encounter with the worst and most degraded of humanity.

In the US, Ceres is one of the three &quot;goddess offices&quot; held in The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry. She is depicted on the Seal of New Jersey. Statues of her top the Missouri State Capitol, Vermont State House, and the Chicago Board of Trade Building, all of which have historical links with agriculture and agricultural trade.

<doc id="78454" wikidata="Q21282358" url="?curid=78454" title="Alcyone and Ceyx">
<text>In Greek mythology, Alcyone (or dubiously Halcyone) (; ) and Ceyx (; ) were a wife and husband who incurred the wrath of the god Zeus for their romantic hubris.

==Etymology==
Alkyóne comes from alkyón (), which refers to a sea-bird with a mournful song or to a kingfisher bird in particular. The meaning(s) of the words is uncertain because &quot;alkyón&quot; is considered to be of pre-Greek, non-Indo-European origin. However, folk etymology related them to the &quot;háls&quot; (, &quot;brine, sea, salt&quot;) and &quot;kyéo&quot; (, &quot;I conceive&quot;). Alkyóne originally is written with a smooth breathing mark, but this false origin beginning with a rough breathing mark (transliterated as the letter H) led to the common misspellings &quot;halkyón&quot; () and &quot;Halkyóne&quot; (), and thus the name of one of the kingfisher bird genus&#x27; in English Halcyon. It is also speculated that Alkyóne is derived from &quot;alké&quot; (, &quot;prowess, battle, guard&quot;) and &quot;onéo&quot; (, from , &quot;onínemi&quot;, &quot;to help, to please&quot;).

Kéyx as referring to a sea-bird appears to be related to &quot;kaúax&quot; (), which is a ravenous sea-bird (, &quot;láros&quot;). These suggest that Kéyx may have been turned into either a sea mew or a tern.

== Mythology ==
Alcyone was a Thessalian princess, the daughter of King Aeolus of Aeolia, either by Enarete or Aegiale. She was the sister of Salmoneus, Athamas, Sisyphus, Cretheus, Perieres, Deioneus, Magnes, Calyce, Canace, Pisidice and Perimede.

Later on, Alcyone became the queen of Trachis after marrying King Ceyx. The latter was the son of Eosphorus (often translated as Lucifer). The couple were very happy together in Trachis. 

According to Pseudo-Apollodorus&#x27;s account, this couple often sacrilegiously called each other &quot;Zeus&quot; and &quot;Hera&quot;. This angered Zeus, so while Ceyx was at sea (in order to consult an oracle, according to Ovid), he killed Ceyx with a thunderbolt. Soon after, Morpheus, the god of dreams, disguised as Ceyx, appeared to Alcyone to tell her of her husband&#x27;s fate. In her grief she threw herself into the sea. Out of compassion, the gods changed them both into &quot;halcyon birds&quot; (common kingfishers), named after her. Apollodorus says that Ceyx was turned into a gannet, and not a kingfisher.

Ovid and Hyginus both also recount the metamorphosis of the pair in and after Ceyx&#x27;s loss in a terrible storm, though they both omit Ceyx and Alcyone calling each other &quot;Zeus&quot; and &quot;Hera&quot; (and Zeus&#x27;s resulting anger) as a reason for it. On the contrary, it is mentioned that while still unaware of Ceyx&#x27;s death in the shipwreck, Alcyone continued to pray at the altar of Hera for his safe return. Ovid also adds the detail of her seeing his body washed ashore before her attempted suicide. Pseudo-Probus, a scholiast on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;, notes that Ovid followed Nicander&#x27;s version of the tale, instead of Theodorus&#x27;s starring another Alcyone.

Virgil in the &quot;Georgics&quot; also alludes to the myth—again without reference to Zeus&#x27;s anger.

It is possible that the earlier myth was a simpler version of the one by Nicander, where a woman named Alcyone mourned her unnamed husband; Ceyx was probably added later due to him being an important figure in mythology and poetry, and also having a wife whose name was Alcyone (as evidenced from the Hesiodic poem &quot;Wedding of Ceyx&quot;).

== Halcyon days ==
Ovid and Hyginus both also make the metamorphosis the origin of the term &quot;&quot;, the seven days in winter when storms never occur. They state that these were originally the 14 days each year (seven days on either side of the shortest day of the year) during which Alcyone (as a kingfisher) made her nest on the beach and laid her eggs while her father Aeolus, the god of the winds, helped her do so safely by restraining the winds and thus calming the waves. The phrase has since come to refer to any peaceful time. Its proper meaning, however, is that of a lucky break, or a bright interval set in the midst of adversity; just as the days of calm and mild weather are set in the height of winter for the sake of the kingfishers&#x27; egglaying according to the myth. Kingfishers however do not live by the sea, so Ovid&#x27;s tale is not based on any actual observations of the species and in fact refers to a mythical bird only later identified with the kingfisher.

The expression () first occurs in Aristophanes&#x27; play &quot;The Birds&quot; 1594, then again in Aristotle, Philochorus, and Lucian. In Latin it occurs as in Pliny the Elder, (&quot;-nĭī&quot;) in Columella and Varro, in Hyginus, and in Plautus and Frontinus.

== Legacy ==
* Various kinds of kingfishers are named after the couple, in reference to the metamorphosis myth:
** The genus &quot;Ceyx&quot; (within the river kingfishers family) is named after him
** The kingfisher family Halcyonidae (tree kingfishers) is named after Alcyone, as is the genus &quot;Halcyon&quot;.
** The belted kingfisher&#x27;s Latin species name (&quot;Megaceryle alcyon&quot;) also references her name.
* Their story features in &quot;The Book of the Duchess&quot;.
* Their story is the basis for the opera &quot;Alcyone&quot; by the French composer Marin Marais and the cantata &quot;Alcyone&quot; by Maurice Ravel
* A collection of Canada&#x27;s celebrated nature poet, Archibald Lampman, &quot;Alcyone&quot;, his final set of poetry published posthumously in 1899, highlights both Lampman&#x27;s apocalyptic and utopian visions of the future.
* T. S. Eliot draws from this myth in &quot;The Dry Salvages&quot;: &quot;And the ragged rock in the restless waters,/Waves wash over it, fogs conceal it;/On a halcyon day it is merely a monument,/In navigable weather it is always a seamark/To lay a course by: but in the sombre season/Or the sudden fury, is what it always was.&quot;

<doc id="78455" wikidata="Q128471" url="?curid=78455" title="Pac-12 Conference">
<text>The Pac-12 Conference is a collegiate athletic conference in the Western United States. It participates at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level for all sports, and its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest level of NCAA football competition. The conference currently comprises two members, Oregon State University and Washington State University.

The modern Pac-12 Conference formed after the disbanding of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), the principal members of which founded the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) in 1959. The conference previously went by the names Big Five, Big Six, Pacific-8, and Pacific-10. The Pac-12 moniker was adopted in 2011 with the addition of Colorado and Utah.

Nicknamed the &quot;Conference of Champions&quot;, the Pac-12 has won more NCAA national championships in team sports than any other conference in history. Washington&#x27;s national title in women&#x27;s rowing in 2017 was the 500th NCAA championship won by a Pac-12 school. The Pac-12 holds a 200-plus championship lead over the second-place conference.

On August 2, 2024, 10 of the 12 members departed from the conference. The Pac-12 is operating as a two-team conference through the 2025–26 academic year, sponsoring five sports—baseball, football, track and field, women&#x27;s gymnastics, and wrestling. In 2026, the Pac-12 will expand to eight members with the addition of five schools from the Mountain West Conference and one from the West Coast Conference.

==Member universities==
===Full members===
The Pac-12 currently has two full-member institutions. The conference was previously split into two divisions, the North Division and the South Division, for football only.

=== Membership map ===

===Future members===
On September 12, 2024, the conference announced it would be adding four new members, Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State and San Diego State, on July 1, 2026. However, the conference needed to add at least two more members to be recognized by the NCAA as an FBS conference. On September 23, 2024, Utah State accepted an offer to join the league as its seventh member. This gave the Pac-12 the seven members needed to preserve its official &quot;multisport&quot; status, though one more football-sponsoring full member will be needed to preserve FBS status. On September 30, 2024, the conference announced that Gonzaga, a non-football college, would be joining as a full member. 

=== Affiliate members ===
The Pac-12 has two affiliate member institutions in California and one in Arkansas. All three participate in the Pac-12 for wrestling.

===Former full members===
No school had left the Pac-12 from its founding as the AAWU in 1959 until 2024, when 10 of its 12 schools left. Two members of the PCC, Idaho and Montana, were not invited to join the AAWU or its successors.

===Membership timeline===

The Pac-12 claims the PCC&#x27;s history as its own. Not only did it maintain the automatic bid from the Rose Bowl inherited from the PCC, but the eight largest schools in the old PCC all eventually joined the new league. However, the old PCC operated under a separate charter.

The Pac-12 is one of the founding members of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF), a conference organized to provide competition in non-revenue Olympic sports. All-Pac-12 members participate in at least one MPSF sport (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track and field both actually have enough participating Pac-12 schools for the conference to sponsor a championship, but the Pac-12 has opted not to do so). For certain sports, the Pac-12 admits certain schools as associate members.


==History==

===Pacific Coast Conference===

The roots of the Pac-12 Conference go back to December 2, 1915, when the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) was founded at the Imperial Hotel in Portland, Oregon, during the annual meeting of the Northwest Conference schools. Charter members were the University of California (now University of California, Berkeley), University of Washington, University of Oregon, and Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University). An official of Stanford University also attended the meeting but declined to join right away because, unlike the other schools, it was not going to sponsor a football team in the coming year and it was not willing to prohibit freshmen from competing in sports. The PCC began play in 1916.

One year later, Washington State College (now Washington State University) joined the league, followed by Stanford University in 1918.

In 1922, the PCC expanded to eight teams with the admission of USC and Idaho. Montana joined the Conference in 1924, and in 1928, the PCC grew to 10 members with the addition of UCLA.

For many years, the conference split into two divisions for basketball and baseball—a Southern Division comprising the four California schools and a Northern Division comprising the six schools in the Pacific Northwest.

In 1950, Montana departed to join the Mountain States Conference. The PCC continued as a nine-team league through June 1959.

===AAWU (Big Five and Big Six)===
Following &quot;pay-for-play&quot; scandals at California, USC, UCLA, and Washington, the PCC disbanded in June 1959. Ten months earlier in August 1958, these four schools agreed to form a new conference that would take effect the following summer. When the four schools and Stanford began discussions for a new conference in 1959, retired admiral Thomas J. Hamilton interceded and suggested the schools consider creating a national &quot;power conference&quot; (Hamilton had been a key player, head coach, and athletic director at Navy, and was the current athletic director at Pittsburgh). Nicknamed the &quot;Airplane Conference&quot;, the five former PCC schools would have played with other major academically-oriented schools, including Army, Navy, Air Force, Notre Dame, Pitt, Penn State, and Syracuse. The effort fell through when a Pentagon official vetoed the idea and the service academies backed out.

On July 1, 1959, the new Athletic Association of Western Universities was launched, with California, UCLA, USC, and Washington as the four charter members. Stanford joined during the first month. Hamilton left Pittsburgh to become the first commissioner of the AAWU, and remained for twelve years. The conference also was popularly known as the Big Five from 1960 to 1962. When Washington State joined in 1962, the conference became informally known as the Big Six. The new league inherited the PCC&#x27;s berth in the Rose Bowl; since 1947, the PCC champion had received an automatic bid to the bowl.

===Pacific-8===
Oregon and Oregon State joined in the summer of 1964. With their addition, the conference was known unofficially as the Pacific Athletic and then the Pacific-8 (as there already was a major conference called the Big Eight). In 1968, the AAWU formally renamed itself the Pacific-8 Conference, or Pac-8 for short. The Pac-8 did not allow a second bowl team from the conference until the 1975 season; in basketball, participation in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) was not allowed until 1973.

Idaho was never invited to join the AAWU; the Vandals were independent for four years until the formation of the Big Sky Conference in 1963, and were independent in football until 1965.

===Pacific-10===
In 1978, the conference added Arizona and Arizona State from the Western Athletic Conference, becoming the Pacific-10 Conference or Pac-10. The invitations to the schools were extended in December 1976, and the expansion formally announced in May 1977.

In the mid-1980s, three of the northwest schools (Oregon, Oregon State, Washington State) were having financial difficulties in athletics, primarily with revenue from football, and their long-term membership in the conference was in question.

The Pac-10 began sponsoring women&#x27;s athletics in the fall of 1986. Women&#x27;s teams previously competed with other large universities on the Pacific coast in either the Northern Pacific Conference or the Western Collegiate Athletic Association.

In the mid-1990s, the conference expressed interest in admitting the University of Colorado and the University of Texas after the collapse of the Southwest Conference. Texas expressed an interest in joining a strong academic conference, but joined three fellow Southwest Conference schools (Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech, and Baylor) to merge with the Big Eight Conference to form the Big 12 Conference in 1996. Colorado elected to remain in the newly formed Big 12.

Before the addition of Colorado and Utah in 2011, only the Ivy League had maintained its membership for a longer time than the Pac-10 among Division I conferences. Commissioner Larry Scott said on February 9, 2010, that the window for expansion was open for the next year as the conference began negotiations for a new television deal. Speaking on a conference call to introduce former Big 12 commissioner Kevin Weiberg as his new deputy, Scott talked about possibly adding new teams to the conference and launching a new television network. Scott, the former head of the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association, took over the conference in July 2009. In his first eight months on the job, he saw growing interest from the membership over the possibility of adding teams for the first time since Arizona and Arizona State joined the conference in 1978.

===Pac-12===
In early June 2010, there were reports that the Pac-10 was considering adding up to six teams to the conference: the University of Texas, Texas A&amp;M University, Texas Tech University, the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State University, and the University of Colorado.

On June 10, 2010, the University of Colorado Boulder accepted an invitation to join the Pac-10 Conference, effective starting with the 2012–2013 academic year. The school later announced it would join the conference a year earlier than previously announced, in the 2011–2012 academic year.

On June 15, 2010, a deal was reached between Texas and the Big 12 Conference to keep Texas, Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State in the Big 12. Following Texas&#x27; decision, the other Big 12 schools that had been rumored candidates to join the Pac-10 announced they would remain in the Big 12. This deal effectively ended the Pac-10&#x27;s ambition to potentially become a sixteen-team conference.

On June 17, 2010, the University of Utah accepted an invitation to join the Pac-10 Conference, effective starting July 2011. Utah was a member of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) with Arizona and Arizona State before those two left for the Pac-10 in 1978. The Utes left an expanded WAC with seven other schools in 1999 to form the new Mountain West Conference. Utah became the first &quot;BCS Buster&quot; to join a BCS conference, having played in (and won) two BCS games beforehand.

On July 27, 2010, the conference unveiled a new logo and announced that the Pac-10 would be renamed the Pac-12 when Utah and Colorado formally joined in July 2011. On October 21, the Pac-12 announced that its football competition would be split into two divisions—a North Division comprising the Pacific Northwest and Bay Area schools, and a South Division comprising the Mountain Time Zone and Southern California schools. On July 1, 2011, the Pac-12 assumed its 12-team alignment when both Colorado and Utah officially joined as full members.

On August 15, 2012, the conference debuted the Pac-12 Network. It was the third college sports conference to launch a dedicated network, and the first to completely fund and own their own network outright.

The conference had been based in Walnut Creek since the late 1970s until August 2014. Since 2014, the conference was headquartered in San Francisco, California, with the conference moving to working remotely once the lease expires in June 2023. The Pac-12 Network and meeting space for headquarters employees are now located at Bishop Ranch in San Ramon, an East Bay suburb.

=== NCAA conference realignment (2021–present) ===

On August 24, 2021, the Pac-12, ACC, and Big Ten announced the formation of a &quot;historic alliance&quot; that would bring their member institutions &quot;together on a collaborative approach surrounding the future evolution of college athletics and scheduling.&quot; The formation of this alliance between three of the Power Five conferences was in response to Oklahoma and Texas announcing plans to leave the Big 12 and join the SEC. The alliance included an inter-conference scheduling component for football and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball. In 2021, the Pac-12 paid $19.8 million to each of its member schools, the lowest distribution in the Power Five.

Despite the alliance, on June 30, 2022, UCLA and USC announced their departure for the Big Ten Conference beginning in the 2024–25 academic year. As a result of losing two of the conference&#x27;s tentpole programs (and the entirety of the Los Angeles television market), the conference&#x27;s ongoing media rights negotiations became much more complicated. ESPN reportedly had made an offer in which the ten remaining schools would receive around $30 million per year. This was rejected by member schools, who countered with a demand for $50 million per school per year. ESPN responded by walking away from the negotiating table.

Reports began circulating that Commissioner Kliavkoff had been to the San Diego State University and SMU campuses for tours. This was allegedly part of the conference&#x27;s vetting process for expansion. San Diego State sent the Mountain West Conference a letter notifying it of the school&#x27;s impending departure. The Pac-12, however, was adamant about securing a media rights deal before expanding. Without an incoming offer before a June 30, 2023, deadline, San Diego State had to rescind its notice of intention to leave the Mountain West.

At the start of Pac-12 Media Days on July 21, 2023, Commissioner Kliavkoff was asked about the status of the media rights deal and conference expansion, deflecting most questions on the matter. Having heard enough, Colorado president Rick George left Media Days early to return to Boulder. Less than a week later on July 27, 2023, Colorado announced it would return to the Big 12 as of the 2024–25 school year.

The nine remaining Pac-12 members then demanded an update on the negotiations, including numbers on expected payouts. Kliavkoff came back with a deal from the Apple TV+ streaming service that paid member institutions in the low-to-mid-$20 million range, albeit with escalators for meeting subscriber quotas. On August 4, 2023, Oregon and Washington announced they would be following UCLA and USC to the Big Ten conference for the 2024 season. Later on that same day, Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah announced that they would follow Colorado to the Big 12 Conference starting in 2024. On September 1, 2023, California and Stanford announced their departure for the Atlantic Coast Conference starting in 2024.

In September 2023, Yahoo! Sports reported that the Pac-12 is &quot;expected to operate as a two-member conference at least for [2024–25]&quot; and would be recognized under a two-year grace period, until 2026, to meet conference requirements in the NCAA bylaws.

On December 5, 2023, Oregon State and Washington State announced that had entered into a football alliance with the Mountain West Conference (MW) for the 2024 season. With the alliance, both programs will play three home games and three away games against MW opponents. The West Coast Conference (WCC) has invited both schools to join as affiliate members for basketball and most other non-football sports. Both partnerships are expected to last from the fall of 2024 to the spring of 2026. Washington State will also participate in the Mountain West for baseball, but Oregon State, a three-time College World Series champion, will become a baseball independent.

After the ten schools departed, the conference continued using the Pac-12 name and branding for at least the 2024–25 academic year. Oregon State and Washington State were nicknamed the &quot;Pac-2&quot; by media outlets, to the point that a game between the two teams during the 2023 football season was jokingly dubbed the &quot;Pac-2 Championship Game&quot; by fans.

====Oregon State and Washington State lawsuit====
On September 8, 2023, Oregon State and Washington State filed a lawsuit against the Pac-12 and Commissioner George Kliavkoff in Washington State Superior Court for control of the conference and its assets. They contended that the departing schools, under the conference constitution, forfeited their right to participate in governing the conference by publicly declaring their intention to leave, and that if they retain control they might use it to dissolve the league and drain its millions of dollars in assets. On November 14, 2023, Judge Gary Libey of the Whitman County, Washington, Superior Court ruled in favor of the two schools. The University of Washington (UW) filed an emergency motion to keep the two schools from gaining full control of the conference for the 2023–24 academic year; a Washington Supreme Court commissioner granted UW&#x27;s motion on November 28, 2023. However, this was overturned on December 15, 2023, by the Washington State Supreme Court, giving Oregon State and Washington State sole control of the Pac-12, meaning the departing schools will no longer be able to vote on conference decisions.

==Apparel==

==Commissioners==
Since restarting in 1959 as the AAWU, the Pac-12 has had six commissioners:

==Olympians==
In a 2017 study by OlympStats, USA Olympians and the medals they won were counted and sorted by their college affiliations. Stanford led all schools with 289 athletes, 408 games, and 282 total medals won. UCLA was second, USC was third, California was fourth, Harvard was fifth in each category, respectively.

Leading the country with the most participants in their respective events are, Colorado in alpine skiing and cycling, Arizona State in archery and badminton, Stanford in baseball, rugby, swimming, tennis and water polo, UCLA in basketball, beach volleyball, gymnastics and softball, USC in athletics and volleyball, and Utah in freestyle skiing.

Since 1924, a Pac-12 school has led the country in the number of athletes in every Summer Olympic Games as of the 2017 study.

<text>Sir David Frederick Attenborough (; born 8 May 1926) is a British broadcaster, biologist, natural historian, and writer. He is best known for writing and presenting, in conjunction with the BBC Studios Natural History Unit, the nine nature documentary series forming the &quot;Life&quot; collection, a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth.

Attenborough was a senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s. First becoming prominent as host of &quot;Zoo Quest&quot; in 1954, his filmography as writer, presenter and narrator has spanned eight decades; it includes &quot;Natural World&quot;, &quot;Wildlife on One&quot;, the &quot;Planet Earth&quot; franchise, &quot;The Blue Planet&quot; and its sequel. He is the only person to have won BAFTA Awards in black and white, colour, high-definition, 3D and 4K resolution. Over his life he has collected dozens of honorary degrees and awards, including three Emmy Awards for Outstanding Narration.

While Attenborough&#x27;s earlier work focused primarily on the wonders of the natural world, his later work has been more vocal in support of environmental causes. He has advocated for restoring planetary biodiversity, limiting population growth, switching to renewable energy, mitigating climate change, reducing meat consumption, and setting aside more areas for natural preservation. On his broadcasting and passion for nature, NPR stated Attenborough &quot;roamed the globe and shared his discoveries and enthusiasms with his patented semi-whisper way of narrating&quot;. He is widely considered a national treasure in the UK, although he himself does not embrace the term.

==Life and family==
David Frederick Attenborough was born on 8 May 1926 in Isleworth, Middlesex, and grew up in College House on the campus of the University of Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal. He is the middle of three sons; his elder brother, Richard, became an actor and director, and his younger brother, John, was an executive at the Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo. During the Second World War, through a British volunteer network known as the Refugee Children&#x27;s Movement, his parents also fostered two Jewish refugee girls from Germany.

Attenborough spent his childhood collecting fossils, stones, and natural specimens. He received encouragement when a young Jacquetta Hawkes admired his collection. He spent much time in the grounds of the university. Aged around 11, he heard that the zoology department needed a large supply of newts, which he offered through his father to supply for 3d each. The source, which he did not reveal at the time, was a pond adjacent to the department. A year later, his adoptive sister Marianne gave him a piece of amber containing prehistoric creatures; some sixty years later, it would be the focus of his programme &quot;The Amber Time Machine.&quot;

In 1936, Attenborough and his brother Richard attended a lecture by Grey Owl (Archibald Belaney) at De Montfort Hall, Leicester, and were influenced by his advocacy of conservation. According to Richard, David was &quot;bowled over by the man&#x27;s determination to save the beaver, by his profound knowledge of the flora and fauna of the Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster should the delicate balance between them be destroyed. The idea that mankind was endangering nature by recklessly despoiling and plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but it is one that has remained part of Dave&#x27;s own credo to this day.&quot; In 1999, Richard directed a biopic of Belaney entitled &quot;Grey Owl&quot;.

Attenborough was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester. He won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge in 1945 to study geology and zoology and obtained a degree in natural sciences. In 1947, he was called up for national service in the Royal Navy and spent two years stationed in North Wales and the Firth of Forth. In 1950, Attenborough married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel. The couple had two children, Robert and Susan. Jane died in 1997. Robert is a senior lecturer in bioanthropology for the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University in Canberra. Susan is a former primary school headmistress.

Attenborough had a pacemaker fitted in June 2013 as well as a double knee replacement in 2015. In September 2013, he commented: &quot;If I was earning my money by hewing coal I would be very glad indeed to stop. But I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m swanning round the world looking at the most fabulously interesting things. Such good fortune.&quot;

==Career==
===Early years at the BBC===
After leaving the navy, Attenborough took a position editing children&#x27;s science textbooks for a publishing company. He soon became disillusioned with the work and in 1950 applied for a job as a radio talk producer with the BBC. Although he was rejected for this job, his CV later attracted the interest of Mary Adams, head of the Talks (factual broadcasting) department of the BBC&#x27;s fledgling television service. Attenborough, like most Britons at that time, did not own a television, and he had seen only one programme in his life.

He accepted Adams&#x27; offer of a three-month training course. In 1952 he joined the BBC full-time. Initially discouraged from appearing on camera because Adams thought his teeth were too big, he became a producer for the Talks department, which handled all non-fiction broadcasts. His early projects included the quiz show &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?&quot; and &quot;Song Hunter,&quot; a series about folk music presented by Alan Lomax.

Attenborough&#x27;s association with natural history programmes began when he produced and presented the three-part series &quot;Animal Patterns.&quot; The studio-bound programme featured animals from London Zoo, with the naturalist Julian Huxley discussing their use of camouflage, aposematism and courtship displays. Through this programme, Attenborough met Jack Lester, the curator of the zoo&#x27;s reptile house, and they decided to make a series about an animal-collecting expedition. The result was &quot;Zoo Quest,&quot; first broadcast in 1954, where Attenborough became the presenter at short notice due to Lester being taken ill.

In 1957, the BBC Natural History Unit was formally established in Bristol. Attenborough was asked to join it, but declined, not wishing to move from London where he and his young family were settled. Instead, he formed his own department, the Travel and Exploration Unit, which allowed him to continue to front &quot;Zoo Quest&quot; as well as produce other documentaries, notably the &quot;Travellers&#x27; Tales&quot; and &quot;Adventure&quot; series. In the early 1960s, Attenborough resigned from the permanent staff of the BBC to study for a postgraduate degree in social anthropology at the London School of Economics, interweaving his study with further filming. However, he accepted an invitation to return to the BBC as controller of BBC Two before he could finish the degree.

===BBC administration===
Attenborough became Controller of BBC Two in March 1965, succeeding Michael Peacock. He had a clause inserted in his contract that would allow him to continue making programmes on an occasional basis. Later the same year he filmed elephants in Tanzania, and in 1969 he made a three-part series on the cultural history of the Indonesian island of Bali. For the 1971 film &quot;A Blank on the Map&quot;, he joined the first Western expedition to a remote highland valley in New Guinea to seek out a lost tribe.

BBC Two was launched in 1964, but had struggled to capture the public&#x27;s imagination. When Attenborough arrived as controller, he quickly abolished the channel&#x27;s quirky kangaroo mascot and shook up the schedule. With a mission to make BBC Two&#x27;s output diverse and different from that offered by other networks, he began to establish a portfolio of programmes that defined the channel&#x27;s identity for decades to come. Under his tenure, music, the arts, entertainment, archaeology, experimental comedy, travel, drama, sport, business, science and natural history all found a place in the weekly schedules. Often, an eclectic mix was offered within a single evening&#x27;s viewing. Programmes he commissioned included &quot;Man Alive&quot;, &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;, &quot;Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; and &quot;The Money Programme&quot;. With the advent of colour television, Attenborough brought snooker to the BBC to show the benefits of the format, as the sport uses coloured balls. The show – &quot;Pot Black&quot; – was later credited with the boom of the sport into the 1980s.

One of his most significant decisions was to order a 13-part series on the history of Western art, to show off the quality of the new UHF colour television service that BBC Two offered. Broadcast to universal acclaim in 1969, &quot;Civilisation&quot; set the blueprint for landmark authored documentaries, which were informally known as &quot;sledgehammer&quot; projects. Others followed, including Jacob Bronowski&#x27;s &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; (also commissioned by Attenborough), and Alistair Cooke&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Attenborough thought that the story of evolution would be a natural subject for such a series. He shared his idea with Christopher Parsons, a producer at the Natural History Unit, who came up with a title &quot;Life on Earth&quot; and returned to Bristol to start planning the series. Attenborough harboured a strong desire to present the series himself, but this would not be possible so long as he remained in a management post.

While in charge of BBC Two, Attenborough turned down Terry Wogan&#x27;s job application to be a presenter on the channel, stating that there weren&#x27;t any suitable vacancies. The channel already had an Irish announcer, with Attenborough reflecting in 2016: &quot;To have had two Irishmen presenting on BBC Two would have looked ridiculous. This is no comment whatsoever on Terry Wogan&#x27;s talents.&quot; Attenborough has also acknowledged that he sanctioned the wiping of television output during this period to cut costs, including a series by Alan Bennett, which he later regretted.

In 1969, Attenborough was promoted to director of programmes, making him responsible for the output of both BBC channels. His tasks, which included agreeing budgets, attending board meetings and firing staff, were now far removed from the business of filming programmes. When Attenborough&#x27;s name was being suggested as a candidate for the position of Director-General of the BBC in 1972, he phoned his brother Richard to confess that he had no appetite for the job. Early the following year, he left his post to return to full-time programme-making, leaving him free to write and present the planned natural history epic.

After his resignation, Attenborough became a freelance broadcaster and started work on his next project, a trip to Indonesia with a crew from the Natural History Unit. It resulted in the 1973 series &quot;Eastwards with Attenborough&quot;, which was similar in tone to the earlier &quot;Zoo Quest&quot;; the main difference was the introduction of colour. Attenborough stated that he wanted to work in Asia, because previous nature documentaries had mostly focused on Africa. That year, Attenborough was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on &quot;The Language of Animals&quot;. After his work on &quot;Eastwards with Attenborough&quot;, he began to work on the scripts for &quot;Life on Earth&quot;.

Due to the scale of his ambition, the BBC decided to partner with an American network to secure the necessary funding. While the negotiations were proceeding, he worked on a number of other television projects. He presented a series on tribal art (&quot;The Tribal Eye&quot;, 1975) and another on the voyages of discovery (&quot;The Explorers&quot;, 1975). He presented a BBC children&#x27;s series about cryptozoology entitled &quot;Fabulous Animals&quot; (1975), which featured mythical creatures such as mermaids and unicorns. Eventually, the BBC signed a co-production deal with Turner Broadcasting and &quot;Life on Earth&quot; moved into production in 1976. In 1979, he visited China and reported to the West for the first time about China&#x27;s one-child policy.

=== &quot;Life&quot; series ===

Beginning with &quot;Life on Earth&quot; in 1979, Attenborough set about creating a body of work which became a benchmark of quality in wildlife film-making, and influenced a generation of documentary film-makers. The series established many of the hallmarks of the BBC&#x27;s natural history output. By treating his subject seriously and researching the latest discoveries, Attenborough and his production team gained the trust of scientists, who responded by allowing him to feature their subjects in his programmes.

Innovation was another factor in &quot;Life on Earth&quot; success: new film-making techniques were devised to get the shots Attenborough wanted, with a focus on events and animals that were up till then unfilmed. International air travel enabled the series to be devised so that Attenborough visited several locations around the globe in each episode, sometimes even changing continents in one sequence. Although appearing as the on-screen presenter, he restricted his time on camera to give more time to his subjects.

Five years after the success of &quot;Life on Earth&quot;, the BBC released &quot;The Living Planet&quot;. This time, Attenborough built his series around the theme of ecology, the adaptations of living things to their environment. It was another critical and commercial success, generating huge international sales for the BBC. In 1990, &quot;The Trials of Life&quot; completed the original Life trilogy, looking at animal behaviour through the different stages of life.

In the 1990s, Attenborough continued to use the &quot;Life&quot; title for a succession of authored documentaries. In 1993, he presented &quot;Life in the Freezer&quot;, the first television series to survey the natural history of Antarctica. Although past normal retirement age, he then embarked on a number of more specialised surveys of the natural world, beginning with plants. They proved a difficult subject for his producers, who had to deliver hours of television featuring what are essentially immobile objects. The result was &quot;The Private Life of Plants&quot; (1995), which showed plants as dynamic organisms by using time-lapse photography to speed up their growth, and went on to earn a Peabody Award.

Prompted by an enthusiastic ornithologist at the BBC Natural History Unit, Attenborough then turned his attention to birds. As he was neither a birdwatcher nor a bird expert, he decided he was better qualified to make &quot;The Life of Birds&quot; (1998) on the theme of behaviour. The documentary series won a second Peabody Award the following year. The order of the remaining &quot;Life&quot; series was dictated by developments in camera technology. For &quot;The Life of Mammals&quot; (2002), low-light and infrared cameras were deployed to reveal the behaviour of nocturnal mammals. The series contains a number of memorable two shots of Attenborough and his subjects, which included chimpanzees, a blue whale and a grizzly bear. Advances in macro photography made it possible to capture the natural behaviour of very small creatures for the first time, and in 2005, &quot;Life in the Undergrowth&quot; introduced audiences to the world of invertebrates.

At this point, Attenborough realised that he had spent 20 years unconsciously assembling a collection of programmes on all the major groups of terrestrial animals and plants – only reptiles and amphibians were missing. When &quot;Life in Cold Blood&quot; was broadcast in 2008, he had the satisfaction of completing the set, brought together in a DVD encyclopaedia called &quot;Life on Land&quot;. He commented: &quot;The evolutionary history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you&#x27;d asked me 20 years ago whether we&#x27;d be attempting such a mammoth task, I&#x27;d have said &#x27;Don&#x27;t be ridiculous!&#x27; These programmes tell a particular story and I&#x27;m sure others will come along and tell it much better than I did, but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years&#x27; time, it will still have something to say about the world we live in.&quot;

However, in 2010 Attenborough asserted that his &quot;First Life&quot; – dealing with evolutionary history before &quot;Life on Earth&quot; – should be included within the &quot;Life&quot; series. In the documentary &quot;Attenborough&#x27;s Journey&quot;, he stated, &quot;This series, to a degree which I really didn&#x27;t fully appreciate until I started working on it, really completes the set.&quot;

===Beyond &quot;Life on Earth&quot;===

Alongside the &quot;Life&quot; series, Attenborough continued to work on other television documentaries, mainly in the natural history genre. He wrote and presented a series on man&#x27;s influence on the natural history of the Mediterranean Basin, &quot;The First Eden&quot;, in 1987. Two years later, he demonstrated his passion for fossils in &quot;Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives&quot;. In 1990, he worked on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Prisoners of Conscience&quot; series where he highlighted the case of the Sudanese poet Mahjoub Sharif.

Attenborough narrated every episode of &quot;Wildlife on One&quot;, a BBC One wildlife series that ran for 253 episodes between 1977 and 2005. At its peak, it drew a weekly audience of eight to ten million, and the 1987 episode &quot;Meerkats United&quot; was voted the best wildlife documentary of all time by BBC viewers. He has narrated over 50 episodes of &quot;Natural World&quot;, BBC Two&#x27;s flagship wildlife series. Its forerunner, &quot;The World About Us&quot;, was created by Attenborough in 1969, as a vehicle for colour television. In 1997, he narrated the &quot;BBC Wildlife Specials&quot;, each focussing on a charismatic species, and screened to mark the Natural History Unit&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

As a writer and narrator, Attenborough continued to collaborate with the BBC Natural History Unit in the new millennium. Alastair Fothergill, a senior producer with whom Attenborough had worked on &quot;The Trials of Life&quot; and &quot;Life in the Freezer&quot;, was making &quot;The Blue Planet&quot; (2001), the Unit&#x27;s first comprehensive series on marine life. He decided not to use an on-screen presenter due to difficulties in speaking to a camera through diving apparatus, but asked Attenborough to narrate the films. The same team reunited for &quot;Planet Earth&quot; (2006), the biggest nature documentary ever made for television and the first BBC wildlife series to be shot in high definition.

In 2009, Attenborough co-wrote and narrated &quot;Life&quot;, a ten-part series focussing on extraordinary animal behaviour, and narrated &quot;Nature&#x27;s Great Events&quot;, which showed how seasonal changes trigger major natural spectacles. In January 2009, the BBC commissioned Attenborough to provide a series of 20 ten-minute monologues covering the history of nature. Entitled &quot;David Attenborough&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;, they were broadcast on Radio 4 on Friday nights.

In 2011, Fothergill gave Attenborough a more prominent role in &quot;Frozen Planet&quot;, a major series on the natural history of the polar regions; Attenborough appeared on screen and authored the final episode, in addition to performing voiceover duties. Attenborough introduced and narrated the Unit&#x27;s first 4K production &quot;Life Story.&quot; For &quot;Planet Earth II&quot; (2016), Attenborough returned as narrator and presenter, with the main theme music composed by Hans Zimmer.
In October 2014, the corporation announced a trio of new one-off Attenborough documentaries as part of a raft of new natural history programmes. &quot;Attenborough&#x27;s Paradise Birds&quot; and &quot;Attenborough&#x27;s Big Birds&quot; was shown on BBC Two and &quot;Waking Giants&quot;, which follows the discovery of giant dinosaur bones in South America, aired on BBC One. The BBC also commissioned Atlantic Productions to make a three-part, Attenborough-fronted series &quot;Great Barrier Reef&quot; in 2015. The series marked the 10th project for Attenborough and Atlantic, and saw him returning to a location he first filmed at in 1957.

On radio, Attenborough has continued as one of the presenters of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Tweet of the Day&quot;, which began a second series in September 2014. Attenborough forged a partnership with Sky, working on documentaries for the broadcaster&#x27;s new 3D network, Sky 3D. Their first collaboration was &quot;Flying Monsters 3D&quot;, a film about pterosaurs which debuted on Christmas Day of 2010. A second film, &quot;The Penguin King 3D&quot;, followed a year later. His next 3D project, &quot;Conquest of the Skies&quot;, made by the team behind the BAFTA award-winning &quot;David Attenborough&#x27;s Natural History Museum Alive&quot;, aired on Sky 3D during Christmas 2014.

Attenborough has narrated three series of &quot;David Attenborough&#x27;s Natural Curiosities&quot; for UKTV channel Watch, with the third series showing in 2015. He has also narrated &quot;A majestic celebration: Wild Karnataka&quot;, India&#x27;s first blue-chip natural history film, directed by Kalyan Varma and Amoghavarsha. &quot;Blue Planet II&quot; was broadcast in 2017, with Attenborough returning as presenter. The series was critically acclaimed and gained the highest UK viewing figure for 2017 of 14.1 million. The series is thought to have triggered a long-lasting increase in public, media and political attention to plastic pollution. Attenborough narrated the 2018 five-part series &quot;Dynasties&quot;, each episode dealing with one species in particular. In 2021, he presented the three-part series &quot;Attenborough&#x27;s Life in Colour&quot;, and &quot;The Mating Game&quot;, a five-part series.

Attenborough returned to prehistoric life with &quot;&quot; and &quot;Prehistoric Planet&quot; aired in April and May 2022 respectively.

===Environmentalist advocacy===

By the turn of the millennium, Attenborough&#x27;s authored documentaries were adopting a more overtly environmentalist stance. In &quot;State of the Planet&quot; (2000), he used the latest scientific evidence and interviews with leading scientists and conservationists to assess the impact of human activities on the natural world. He later turned to the issues of global warming (&quot;The Truth about Climate Change&quot;, 2006) and human population growth (&quot;How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?&quot;, 2009). He contributed a programme which highlighted the plight of endangered species to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Saving Planet Earth&quot; project in 2007, the 50th anniversary of the Natural History Unit.

In 2019, Attenborough narrated &quot;Our Planet&quot;, an eight-part documentary series, for Netflix. In contrast to much of his prior work for the BBC, this series emphasised the destructive role of human activities throughout the series. Before, he would often note concerns in a final section of the work. He also narrated &quot;Wild Karnataka&quot;, a documentary about the Karnataka forest area. In 2019, Attenborough&#x27;s one-off film documentary about climate change for BBC One called &quot;Climate Change – The Facts&quot; was aired; the tone of the documentary was significantly graver than previous work for the BBC. This was followed by &quot;&quot;, which is partly based on the 2019 IPBES report on the decline of biodiversity.

In 2020, Attenborough narrated the documentary film &quot;David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet&quot;. The film acts as Attenborough&#x27;s witness statement, reflecting on his career as a naturalist and his hopes for the future. It was released on Netflix on 4 October 2020. Further work for Netflix includes the documentary titled &quot;Breaking Boundaries: The Science of Our Planet&quot;, released on 4 June 2021. In October 2020, Attenborough began filming in Cambridge for &quot;The Green Planet&quot;. In 2021, Attenborough narrated &quot;A Perfect Planet&quot;, a five-part earth science series for BBC One.

Attenborough was a key figure in the build-up to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), and gave a speech at the opening ceremony. In his speech he stated that humans were &quot;the greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth&quot; and spoke of his optimism for the future, finishing by saying &quot;In my lifetime I&#x27;ve witnessed a terrible decline. In yours, you could and should witness a wonderful recovery.&quot;

In 2022, the United Nations Environment Programme recognised Attenborough as a Champion of the Earth &quot;for his dedication to research, documentation, and advocacy for the protection of nature and its restoration&quot;.

==Views and advocacy==
===Environment===

Attenborough&#x27;s programmes have often included references to the impact of human society on the natural world. The last episode of &quot;The Living Planet&quot;, for example, focuses almost entirely on humans&#x27; destruction of the environment and ways that it could be stopped or reversed. Despite this, he has been criticised for not giving enough prominence to environmental messages. In 2018 while promoting &quot;Dynasties&quot;, he said that repeated messages on threats to wildlife in programming could be a &quot;turn-off&quot; to viewers.

Some environmentalists feel that programmes like Attenborough&#x27;s give a false picture of idyllic wilderness and do not do enough to acknowledge that such areas are increasingly encroached upon by humans. However, the increased urgency of environmental messaging in films such as &quot;&quot;, which depicts the continuing sixth mass extinction, &quot;Climate Change – The Facts&quot; and &quot;A Life on Our Planet&quot; from 2019 and 2020 received praise. In &quot;Seven Worlds, One Planet&quot;, Attenborough discusses the devastating impact that deforestation is having on the planet and the species.

In 2005 and 2006, Attenborough backed a BirdLife International project to stop the killing of albatross by longline fishing boats. He gave support to WWF&#x27;s campaign to have 220,000 square kilometres of Borneo&#x27;s rainforest designated a protected area. He serves as a vice-president of The Conservation Volunteers, vice-president of Fauna and Flora International, president of Butterfly Conservation and president emeritus of Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust.

In 2003, Attenborough launched an appeal on behalf of the World Land Trust to create a rainforest reserve in Ecuador in memory of Christopher Parsons, the producer of &quot;Life on Earth&quot; and a personal friend, who had died the previous year. The same year, he helped to launch ARKive, a global project instigated by Parsons to gather together natural history media into a digital library. ARKive is an initiative of Wildscreen, of which Attenborough is a patron. He later became patron of the World Land Trust. In 2020, he backed a Fauna and Flora International campaign calling for a global moratorium on deep sea mining for its impact on marine life.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Attenborough advocated on behalf of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and its conservation efforts, which have been impacted by the economic fallout from the pandemic. In 2020, Attenborough was named as a member of the Earthshot prize Council, an initiative of Prince William to find solutions to environmental issues. He is a patron of the Friends of Richmond Park and serves on the advisory board of BBC Wildlife magazine.

Attenborough was initially sceptical about the human influence on climate change, and stated that a 2004 lecture finally convinced him humans were responsible. He remained silent on the issue until 2006. Attenborough attended and spoke at COP26 as the &quot;People&#x27;s Advocate&quot; for the event, and urged world leaders to act to reduce emissions. He supported Glyndebourne in their successful application to obtain planning permission for a wind turbine in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and gave evidence at the planning inquiry arguing in favour of the proposal. In his 2020 documentary film &quot;David Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet&quot;, Attenborough advocates for people to adopt a vegetarian diet or to reduce meat consumption to save wildlife, noting that &quot;the planet can&#x27;t support billions of meat-eaters.&quot;

=== Human population ===
Attenborough has linked anthropogenic effects on the environment with human population growth. He has attracted criticism for his views on human overpopulation and human population control. He is a patron of Population Matters, a UK charity advocating for family planning, sustainable consumption and proposed sustainable human population. In a 2013 interview with the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Attenborough described humans as a &quot;plague on the Earth&quot;, and described the act of sending food to famine-stricken countries as &quot;barmy&quot; for population reasons. He called for more debate about human population growth, saying that since he &quot;first started making programmes 60 years ago, the human population has tripled.&quot;

According to Attenborough, improving women&#x27;s rights around the world is an effective way &quot;to limit our birth rate&quot;. He said that &quot;anyone who thinks that you can have infinite growth in a finite environment is either a madman or an economist.&quot;

=== Religious views ===
Attenborough considers himself an agnostic. When asked whether his observation of the natural world has given him faith in a creator, he generally responds with some version of this story, making reference to the &quot;Onchocerca volvulus&quot; parasitic worm:

He has explained that he feels the evidence all over the planet clearly shows evolution to be the best way to explain the diversity of life, and that &quot;as far as [he&#x27;s] concerned, if there is a supreme being then he chose organic evolution as a way of bringing into existence the natural world&quot;. In a BBC Four interview with Mark Lawson, he was asked if he at any time had any religious faith. He replied simply, &quot;no&quot;. He said &quot;It never really occurred to me to believe in God&quot;.

In 2002, Attenborough joined an effort by leading clerics and scientists to oppose the inclusion of creationism in the curriculum of UK state-funded independent schools which receive private sponsorship, such as the Emmanuel Schools Foundation.
In 2009, he stated that the Book of Genesis, by saying that the world was there for people to control, had taught generations that they can &quot;dominate&quot; the environment, and that this has resulted in the devastation of vast areas of the environment. He further explained to the science journal &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s why Darwinism, and the fact of evolution, is of great importance, because it is that attitude which has led to the devastation of so much, and we are in the situation that we are in&quot;.

Also in early 2009, the BBC broadcast an Attenborough one-hour special, &quot;Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life&quot;. In reference to the programme, Attenborough stated that &quot;People write to me that evolution is only a theory. Well, it is not a theory. Evolution is as solid a historical fact as you could conceive. Evidence from every quarter. What is a theory is whether natural selection is the mechanism and the only mechanism. That is a theory. But the historical reality that dinosaurs led to birds and mammals produced whales, that&#x27;s not theory.&quot; He strongly opposes creationism and its offshoot &quot;intelligent design&quot;, saying that the results of a survey that found a quarter of science teachers in state schools believe that creationism should be taught alongside evolution in science lessons was &quot;really terrible&quot;.

In March 2009, Attenborough appeared on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;. Attenborough stated that he felt evolution did not rule out the existence of a God and accepted the title of agnostic saying, &quot;My view is: I don&#x27;t know one way or the other but I don&#x27;t think that evolution is against a belief in God&quot;.

Attenborough has joined the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and other top scientists in signing a campaign statement co-ordinated by the British Humanist Association (BHA). The statement calls for &quot;creationism to be banned from the school science curriculum and for evolution to be taught more widely in schools&quot;.

===BBC and public service broadcasting===
Attenborough is a lifelong supporter of the BBC, public service broadcasting and the television licence. He has said that public service broadcasting &quot;is one of the things that distinguishes this country and makes me want to live here&quot;, and believes that it is not reducible to individual programmes, but &quot;can only effectively operate as a network [...] that measures its success not only by its audience size but by the range of its schedule&quot;.

Attenborough expressed the view that there had often been people wanting to remove the BBC, adding &quot;there&#x27;s always been trouble about the licence and if you dropped your guard you could bet our bottom dollar there&#x27;d be plenty of people who&#x27;d want to take it away. The licence fee is the basis on which the BBC is based and if you destroy it, broadcasting... becomes a wasteland.&quot; He expressed regret at some of the changes made to the BBC in the 1990s by its director-general, John Birt, who introduced an internal market at the corporation, slimmed and closed some departments and outsourced much of the corporation&#x27;s output to private production companies.

Although he said Birt&#x27;s policies had poor results, Attenborough also acknowledged &quot;the BBC had to change.&quot; In 2008, he criticised the BBC&#x27;s television schedules, positing that the two senior networks, BBC One and BBC Two – which Attenborough stated were &quot;first set up as a partnership&quot; – now &quot;schedule simultaneously programmes of identical character, thereby contradicting the very reason that the BBC was given a second network.&quot;

===Politics===
In 1998, Attenborough described himself as &quot;a standard, boring left-wing liberal&quot; and expressed the view that the market economy was &quot;misery&quot;. In 2013, Attenborough joined the rock guitarists Brian May and Slash in opposing the government&#x27;s policy on the cull of badgers in the UK by participating in a song dedicated to badgers. Attenborough was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in the 2014 referendum on that issue. Prior to the 2015 UK general election, Attenborough was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party&#x27;s Caroline Lucas.

In a 2020 interview, Attenborough criticised excess capitalism as a driver of ecological imbalance, stating &quot;the excesses the capitalist system has brought us, have got to be curbed somehow&quot;, and that &quot;greed does not actually lead to joy&quot;, although he added &quot;That doesn&#x27;t mean to say that capitalism is dead&quot;. He also lamented the lack of international cooperation on climate change, and said &quot;there should be no dominant nation on this planet.&quot; In 2021, Attenborough told the leaders of the 47th G7 summit that &quot;tackling climate change was now as much a political challenge as it was a scientific or technological one&quot; and urged for more action. Attenborough also stated that &quot;(we) are on the verge of destabilising the entire planet.&quot; 

In 2023, Attenborough was described by the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as a figure &quot;invaluable to green diplomacy&quot; in the UK, placing him twenty-third in their list of Britain&#x27;s most powerful left-wing figures, above many elected politicians.

==Achievements, awards and recognition==

Attenborough&#x27;s contribution to broadcasting and wildlife film-making has brought him international recognition. He has been called &quot;the great communicator, the peerless educator&quot; and &quot;the greatest broadcaster of our time.&quot; His programmes are often cited as an example of what public service broadcasting should be, even by critics of the BBC, and have influenced a generation of wildlife film-makers.

===Honorary titles===
By January 2013, Attenborough had collected 32 honorary degrees from British universities, more than any other person. In 1980, he was honoured by the Open University, with which he has had a close association throughout his career. He has honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Durham University (1982) and the University of Cambridge (1984) and honorary Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the University of Oxford (1988) and the University of Ghent (1997).

In 2006, the two eldest Attenborough brothers returned to their home city to receive the title of Distinguished Honorary Fellows of the University of Leicester, &quot;in recognition of a record of continuing distinguished service to the University.&quot; David Attenborough was previously awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by the university in 1970, and was made an honorary Freeman of the City of Leicester in 1990. In 2013, he was made an Honorary Freeman of the City of Bristol. In 2010, he was awarded Honorary Doctorates from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University and Nottingham Trent University.

Attenborough has received the title Honorary Fellow from Clare College, Cambridge (1980), the Zoological Society of London (1998), the Linnean Society (1999), the Institute of Biology (Now the Royal Society of Biology) (2000), and the Society of Antiquaries (2007). He is Honorary Patron of the North American Native Plant Society and was elected as a Corresponding Member of the Australian Academy of Science.

===Recognition===
Attenborough has been featured as the subject of a number of BBC television programmes. &quot;Life on Air&quot; (2002) examined the legacy of his work, and &quot;Attenborough the Controller&quot; (2002) focused on his time in charge of BBC Two. He was also featured prominently in &quot;The Way We Went Wild&quot; (2004), a series about natural history television presenters, and &quot;100 Years of Wildlife Films&quot; (2007), a programme marking the centenary of the nature documentary. In 2006, British television viewers were asked to vote for their &quot;Favourite Attenborough Moments&quot; for a UKTV poll to coincide with the broadcaster&#x27;s 80th birthday. The winning clip showed Attenborough observing the mimicry skills of the superb lyrebird.

Attenborough was named the most trusted celebrity in the UK in a 2006 &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; poll, and in 2007 he won &quot;The Culture Show&quot; Living Icon Award. He has been named among the 100 Greatest Britons in a 2002 BBC poll and is one of the top ten &quot;Heroes of Our Time&quot; according to &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine. In September 2009, London&#x27;s Natural History Museum opened the Attenborough Studio, part of its Darwin Centre development.

In 2012, Attenborough was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life. The same year, Attenborough featured in the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The New Elizabethans&quot; to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named him among the group of people in the UK &quot;whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands&quot;.

A British polar research ship was named RRS &quot;Sir David Attenborough&quot; in his honour. While an Internet poll suggesting the name of the ship had the most votes for &quot;Boaty McBoatface&quot;, the science minister Jo Johnson said there were &quot;more suitable names&quot;, and the official name was eventually picked up from one of the other more favoured choices. However, one of its research sub-sea vehicles was named &quot;Boaty&quot; in recognition of the public vote.

Attenborough is also recognised by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as having the longest career as a natural historian and presenter in television.

====Species named after Attenborough====
At least 20 species and genera, both living and extinct, have been named in Attenborough&#x27;s honour. Plants named after him include an alpine hawkweed (&quot;Hieracium attenboroughianum&quot;) discovered in the Brecon Beacons, a species of Ecuadorian flowering tree (&quot;Blakea attenboroughi&quot;), one of the world&#x27;s largest-pitchered carnivorous plants (&quot;Nepenthes attenboroughii&quot;), along with a genus of flowering plants (&quot;Sirdavidia&quot;).

Several arthropods are named after Attenborough, including a butterfly, Attenborough&#x27;s black-eyed satyr (&quot;Euptychia attenboroughi&quot;), a dragonfly, Attenborough&#x27;s pintail (&quot;Acisoma attenboroughi&quot;), a millimetre-long goblin spider (&quot;Prethopalpus attenboroughi&quot;), an ornate Caribbean smiley-faced spider (&quot;Spintharus davidattenboroughi&quot;), an Indonesian flightless weevil (&quot;Trigonopterus attenboroughi&quot;), a Madagascan ghost shrimp (&quot;Ctenocheloides attenboroughi&quot;), and a soil snail (&quot;Palaina attenboroughi&quot;).

The Monogenean &quot;Cichlidogyrus attenboroughi&quot;, a parasite from a deep-sea fish in Lake Tanganyika, may be the only parasitic species named after him. Several vertebrates have also been named after Attenborough, including a Namibian lizard (&quot;Platysaurus attenboroughi&quot;), a bird (&quot;Polioptila attenboroughi&quot;), a Peruvian frog (&quot;Pristimantis attenboroughi&quot;), a Madagascan stump-toed frog (&quot;Stumpffia davidattenboroughi&quot;), and one of only four species of echidna (&quot;Zaglossus attenboroughi&quot;).
In 1993, after discovering that the Mesozoic reptile &quot;Plesiosaurus conybeari&quot; did not belong to the genus &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot;, the palaeontologist Robert Bakker renamed the species &quot;Attenborosaurus conybeari&quot;. A fossilised armoured fish discovered in Western Australia in 2008 was named &quot;Materpiscis attenboroughi&quot;, after Attenborough had filmed at the site and highlighted its scientific importance in &quot;Life on Earth&quot;. The &quot;Materpiscis&quot; fossil is believed to be the earliest organism capable of internal fertilisation. 

In 2015, a species of tree from Gabon (in the Annonaceae family) &quot;Sirdavidia&quot; was named with his title.

A miniature marsupial lion, &quot;Microleo attenboroughi&quot;, was named in his honour in 2016. The fossil grasshopper &quot;Electrotettix attenboroughi&quot; was named after Attenborough. In March 2017, a 430 million year old tiny crustacean was named after him. Called &quot;Cascolus ravitis&quot;, the first word is a Latin translation of the root meaning of &quot;Attenborough&quot;, and the second is based on a description of him in Latin. In July 2017, the Caribbean bat &quot;Myotis attenboroughi&quot; was named after him. A new species of fan-throated lizard from coastal Kerala in southern India was named &quot;Sitana attenboroughii&quot; in his honour when it was described in 2018.

In 2018, a new species of phytoplankton, &quot;Syracosphaera azureaplaneta&quot;, was named to honour &quot;The Blue Planet&quot;, the TV documentary presented by Attenborough, and to recognise his contribution to promoting understanding of the oceanic environment. The same year, Attenborough was also commemorated in the name of the scarab beetle &quot;Sylvicanthon attenboroughi&quot;. 

In 2020, &quot;Nothobranchius attenboroughi&quot;, a brightly coloured seasonal fish species was described in his honour. This species is endemic to Tanzania and it is known from ephemeral pools and marshes associated with the Grumeti River and other small systems draining into Lake Victoria at the east side of the lake, largely within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. The small seasonal fish inhabit ephemeral habitats in freshwater wetlands and have extreme life-history adaptations, having an annual life cycle, a key adaptation to reproduce in the seasonally arid savannah biome and allowing the eggs to survive the periodic drying up of the seasonal natural habitats.

In 2021 an extinct species of horseshoe crab was named &quot;Attenborolimulus superspinosus.&quot; In July 2022, a fossil of a 560-million-year-old creature named &quot;Auroralumina attenboroughii&quot;, which researchers believe to be the first animal predator, was named after Attenborough.

===Awards===

As of 2014, he was the only person to have won BAFTA Awards for programmes in black and white, colour, high-definition and 3D.

==Filmography==

Attenborough&#x27;s television credits span eight decades. His association with natural history programmes dates back to &quot;The Pattern of Animals&quot; and &quot;Zoo Quest&quot; in the early 1950s. His most influential work, 1979&#x27;s &quot;Life on Earth&quot;, launched a strand of nine authored documentaries with the BBC Natural History Unit which shared the &quot;Life&quot; strand name and spanned 30 years. He narrated the long-running BBC series &quot;Wildlife on One&quot;. In his later career, he provided narration for several high-profile BBC wildlife documentaries, among them &quot;The Blue Planet&quot; and &quot;Planet Earth&quot;. He became a pioneer in the 3D documentary format with &quot;Flying Monsters&quot; in 2010.

==Bibliography==
David Attenborough&#x27;s work as an author has strong parallels with his broadcasting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, his published work included accounts of his animal collecting expeditions around the world, which became the &quot;Zoo Quest&quot; series. He wrote an accompanying volume to each of his nine &quot;Life&quot; documentaries, along with books on tribal art and birds of paradise. His autobiography, &quot;Life on Air&quot;, was published in 2002, revised in 2009 and is one of a number of his works which is available as a self-narrated audiobook. Attenborough has contributed forewords and introductions to many other works, notably those accompanying &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, &quot;Frozen Planet&quot;, &quot;Africa&quot; and other BBC series he has narrated.

<text>In Greek and Roman mythology, the Giants, also called Gigantes (Greek: Γίγαντες, &quot;&quot;, Γίγας, &quot;&quot;), were a race of great strength and aggression, though not necessarily of great size. They were known for the Gigantomachy (also spelled Gigantomachia), their battle with the Olympian gods. According to Hesiod, the Giants were the offspring of Gaia (Earth), born from the blood that fell when Uranus (Sky) was castrated by his Titan son Cronus.

Archaic and Classical representations show Gigantes as man-sized hoplites (heavily armed ancient Greek foot soldiers) fully human in form. Later representations (after c. 380 BC) show Gigantes with snakes for legs. In later traditions, the Giants were often confused with other opponents of the Olympians, particularly the Titans, an earlier generation of large and powerful children of Gaia and Uranus.

The vanquished Giants were said to be buried under volcanoes and to be the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

==Origins==

The name &quot;Gigantes&quot; is usually taken to imply &quot;earth-born&quot;, and Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; makes this explicit by having the Giants be the offspring of Gaia (Earth). According to Hesiod, Gaia, mating with Uranus, bore many children: the first generation of Titans, the Cyclopes, and the Hundred-Handers. However, Uranus hated his children and, as soon as they were born, he imprisoned them inside Gaia, causing her much distress. Therefore, Gaia made a sickle of adamant which she gave to Cronus, the youngest of her Titan sons, and hid him (presumably still inside Gaia&#x27;s body) to wait in ambush. When Uranus came to lie with Gaia, Cronus castrated his father, and &quot;the bloody drops that gushed forth [Gaia] received, and as the seasons moved round she bore ... the great Giants.&quot; From these same drops of blood also came the Erinyes (Furies) and the Meliai (ash tree nymphs), while the severed genitals of Uranus falling into the sea resulted in a white foam from which Aphrodite grew. The mythographer Apollodorus also has the Giants being the offspring of Gaia and Uranus, though he makes no connection with Uranus&#x27; castration, saying simply that Gaia &quot;vexed on account of the Titans, brought forth the Giants&quot;.

There are three brief references to the &quot;Gigantes&quot; in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, though it is not entirely clear that Homer and Hesiod understood the term to mean the same thing. Homer has Giants among the ancestors of the Phaiakians, a race of men encountered by Odysseus, their ruler Alcinous being the son of Nausithous, who was the son of Poseidon and Periboea, the daughter of the Giant king Eurymedon. Elsewhere in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Alcinous says that the Phaiakians, like the Cyclopes and the Giants, are &quot;near kin&quot; to the gods. Odysseus describes the Laestrygonians (another race encountered by Odysseus in his travels) as more like Giants than men. Pausanias, the 2nd century AD geographer, read these lines of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; to mean that, for Homer, the Giants were a race of mortal men.

The 6th–5th century BC lyric poet Bacchylides calls the Giants &quot;sons of the Earth&quot;. Later the term &quot;gegeneis&quot; (&quot;earthborn&quot;) became a common epithet of the Giants. The first century Latin writer Hyginus has the Giants being the offspring of Gaia and Tartarus, another primordial Greek deity.

==Confusion with Titans and others==
Though distinct in early traditions, Hellenistic and later writers often confused or conflated the Giants and their Gigantomachy with an earlier set of offspring of Gaia and Uranus, the Titans and their war with the Olympian gods, the Titanomachy. This confusion extended to other opponents of the Olympians, including the huge monster Typhon, the offspring of Gaia and Tartarus, whom Zeus finally defeated with his thunderbolt, and the Aloadae, the large, strong and aggressive brothers Otus and Ephialtes, who piled Pelion on top of Ossa in order to scale the heavens and attack the Olympians (though in the case of Ephialtes there was probably a Giant with the same name). For example, Hyginus includes the names of three Titans, Coeus, Iapetus, and Astraeus, along with Typhon and the Aloadae, in his list of Giants, and Ovid seems to conflate the Gigantomachy with the later siege of Olympus by the Aloadae.

Ovid also seems to confuse the Hundred-Handers with the Giants, whom he gives a &quot;hundred arms&quot;. So perhaps do Callimachus and Philostratus, since they both make Aegaeon the cause of earthquakes, as was often said about the Giants (see below).

==Descriptions==
Homer describes the Giant king Eurymedon as &quot;great-hearted&quot; (&quot;μεγαλήτορος&quot;), and his people as &quot;insolent&quot; (&quot;ὑπερθύμοισι&quot;) and &quot;froward&quot; (&quot;ἀτάσθαλος&quot;). Hesiod calls the Giants &quot;strong&quot; (&quot;κρατερῶν&quot;) and &quot;great&quot; (&quot;μεγάλους&quot;) which may or may not be a reference to their size. Though a possible later addition, the &quot;Theogony&quot; also has the Giants born &quot;with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands&quot;.

Other early sources characterize the Giants by their excesses. Pindar describes the excessive violence of the Giant Porphyrion as having provoked &quot;beyond all measure&quot;. Bacchylides calls the Giants arrogant, saying that they were destroyed by &quot;Hybris&quot; (the Greek word hubris personified). The earlier seventh century BC poet Alcman perhaps had already used the Giants as an example of hubris, with the phrases &quot;vengeance of the gods&quot; and &quot;they suffered unforgettable punishments for the evil they did&quot; being possible references to the Gigantomachy.

Homer&#x27;s comparison of the Giants to the Laestrygonians is suggestive of similarities between the two races. The Laestrygonians, who &quot;hurled ... rocks huge as a man could lift&quot;, certainly possessed great strength, and possibly great size, as their king&#x27;s wife is described as being as big as a mountain.

Over time, descriptions of the Giants make them less human, more monstrous and more &quot;gigantic&quot;. According to Apollodorus the Giants had great size and strength, a frightening appearance, with long hair and beards and scaly feet. Ovid makes them &quot;serpent-footed&quot; with a &quot;hundred arms&quot;, and Nonnus has them &quot;serpent-haired&quot;.

==The Gigantomachy==
The most important divine struggle in Greek mythology was the Gigantomachy, the battle fought between the Giants and the Olympian gods for supremacy of the cosmos. It is primarily for this battle that the Giants are known, and its importance to Greek culture is attested by the frequent depiction of the Gigantomachy in Greek art.

===Early sources===

The references to the Gigantomachy in archaic sources are sparse. Neither Homer nor Hesiod mention anything explicit about the Giants battling the gods.
Homer&#x27;s remark that Eurymedon &quot;brought destruction on his froward people&quot; might possibly be a reference to the Gigantomachy and Hesiod&#x27;s remark that Heracles performed a &quot;great work among the immortals&quot; is probably a reference to Heracles&#x27; crucial role in the gods&#x27; victory over the Giants. The Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot; (also called &quot;Ehoiai&quot;), following mentions of Heracles&#x27; sacks of Troy and of Kos, refers to his having slain &quot;presumptuous Giants&quot;. Another probable reference to the Gigantomachy in the &quot;Catalogue&quot; has Zeus produce Heracles to be &quot;a protector against ruin for gods and men&quot;.

There are indications that there might have been a lost epic poem, a &quot;Gigantomachia&quot;, which gave an account of the war: Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; says that the Muses sing of the Giants, and the sixth century BC poet Xenophanes mentions the Gigantomachy as a subject to be avoided at table. The Apollonius scholia refers to a &quot;Gigantomachia&quot; in which the Titan Cronus (as a horse) sires the centaur Chiron by mating with Philyra (the daughter of two Titans), but the scholiast may be confusing the Titans and Giants. Other possible archaic sources include the lyric poets Alcman (mentioned above) and the sixth-century Ibycus.

The late sixth early fifth century BC lyric poet Pindar provides some of the earliest details of the battle between the Giants and the Olympians. He locates it &quot;on the plain of Phlegra&quot; and has Teiresias foretell Heracles killing Giants &quot;beneath [his] rushing arrows&quot;. He calls Heracles &quot;you who subdued the Giants&quot;, and has Porphyrion, whom he calls &quot;the king of the Giants&quot;, being overcome by the bow of Apollo. Euripides&#x27; &quot;Heracles&quot; has its hero shooting Giants with arrows, and his &quot;Ion&quot; has the chorus describe seeing a depiction of the Gigantomachy on the late sixth century Temple of Apollo at Delphi, with Athena fighting the Giant Enceladus with her &quot;gorgon shield&quot;, Zeus burning the Giant Mimas with his &quot;mighty thunderbolt, blazing at both ends&quot;, and Dionysus killing an unnamed Giant with his &quot;ivy staff&quot;. The early 3rd century BC author Apollonius of Rhodes briefly describes an incident where the sun god Helios takes up Hephaestus, exhausted from the fight in Phlegra, on his chariot.

===Apollodorus===
The most detailed account of the Gigantomachy is that of the (first or second-century AD) mythographer Apollodorus. None of the early sources give any reasons for the war. Scholia to the &quot;Iliad&quot; mention the rape of Hera by the Giant Eurymedon, while according to the scholia to Pindar&#x27;s &quot;Isthmian&quot; 6, it was the theft of the cattle of Helios by the Giant Alcyoneus that started the war. Apollodorus, who also mentions the theft of Helios&#x27; cattle by Alcyoneus, suggests a mother&#x27;s revenge as the motive for the war, saying that Gaia bore the Giants because of her anger over the Titans (who had been vanquished and imprisoned by the Olympians). Seemingly, as soon as the Giants are born they begin hurling &quot;rocks and burning oaks at the sky&quot;.

There was a prophecy that the Giants could not be killed by the gods alone, but they could be killed with the help of a mortal. Hearing this, Gaia sought for a certain plant (&quot;pharmakon&quot;) that would protect the Giants. Before Gaia or anyone else could find this plant, Zeus forbade Eos (Dawn), Selene (Moon) and Helios (Sun) to shine, harvested all of the plant himself and then he had Athena summon Heracles.

According to Apollodorus, Alcyoneus and Porphyrion were the two strongest Giants. Heracles shot Alcyoneus, who fell to the ground but then revived, for Alcyoneus was immortal within his native land. So Heracles, on Athena&#x27;s advice, dragged him beyond the borders of that land, where Alcyoneus then died (compare with Antaeus). Porphyrion attacked Heracles and Hera, but Zeus caused Porphyrion to become enamoured of Hera, whom Porphyrion then tried to rape, but Zeus struck Porphyrion with his thunderbolt and Heracles killed him with an arrow.

Other Giants and their fates are mentioned by Apollodorus. Ephialtes was blinded by an arrow from Apollo in his left eye, and another arrow from Heracles in his right. Eurytus was killed by Dionysus with his thyrsus, Clytius by Hecate with her torches and Mimas by Hephaestus with &quot;missiles of red-hot metal&quot; from his forge. Athena crushed Enceladus under the Island of Sicily and flayed Pallas, using his skin as a shield. Poseidon broke off a piece of the island of Kos called Nisyros, and threw it on top of Polybotes (Strabo also relates the story of Polybotes buried under Nisyros but adds that some say Polybotes lies under Kos instead). Hermes, wearing Hades&#x27; helmet, killed Hippolytus, Artemis killed Gration, and the Moirai (Fates) killed Agrius and Thoas with bronze clubs. The rest of the giants were &quot;destroyed&quot; by thunderbolts thrown by Zeus, with each Giant being shot with arrows by Heracles (as the prophecy seemingly required).

===Ovid===
The Latin poet Ovid gives a brief account of the Gigantomachy in his poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Ovid, apparently including the Aloadae&#x27;s attack upon Olympus as part of the Gigantomachy, has the Giants attempt to seize &quot;the throne of Heaven&quot; by piling &quot;mountain on mountain to the lofty stars&quot; but Jove (i.e. Jupiter, the Roman Zeus) overwhelms the Giants with his thunderbolts, overturning &quot;from Ossa huge, enormous Pelion&quot;. Ovid says that (as &quot;fame reports&quot;) from the blood of the Giants came a new race of beings in human form. According to Ovid, Earth (Gaia) did not want the Giants to perish without a trace, so &quot;reeking with the copious blood of her gigantic sons&quot;, she gave life to the &quot;steaming gore&quot; of the blood soaked battleground. These new offspring, like their fathers the Giants, also hated the gods and possessed a bloodthirsty desire for &quot;savage slaughter&quot;.

Later in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Ovid refers to the Gigantomachy as: &quot;The time when serpent footed giants strove / to fix their hundred arms on captive Heaven&quot;. Here Ovid apparently conflates the Giants with the Hundred-Handers, who, though in Hesiod fought alongside Zeus and the Olympians, in some traditions fought against them.

=== Other late sources ===
Eratosthenes records that Dionysus, Hephaestus and several satyrs mounted on donkeys and charged against the Giants. As they drew closer and before the Giants had spotted them, the donkeys brayed, scaring off some Giants who ran away in terror of the unseen enemies, for they had never heard a donkey&#x27;s bray before. Dionysus placed the donkeys in the skies in gratitude, and in vase paintings from the classical period, satyrs and Maenads can sometimes be seen confronting their gigantic opponents.

A late Latin grammarian of the fifth century AD, Servius, mentions that during the battle, the eagle of Zeus (who once had been the boy Aëtos before his metamorphosis) assisted his master by placing the lightning bolts on his hands.

===Location===
Various places have been associated with the Giants and the Gigantomachy. As noted above Pindar has the battle occur at Phlegra (&quot;the place of burning&quot;), as do other early sources. Phlegra was said to be an ancient name for Pallene (modern Kassandra) and Phlegra/Pallene was the usual birthplace of the Giants and site of the battle. Apollodorus, who placed the battle at Pallene, says the Giants were born &quot;as some say, in Phlegrae, but according to others in Pallene&quot;. The name Phlegra and the Gigantomachy were also often associated, by later writers, with a volcanic plain in Italy, west of Naples and east of Cumae, called the Phlegraean Fields. The third century BC poet Lycophron, apparently locates a battle of gods and Giants in the vicinity of the volcanic island of Ischia, the largest of the Phlegraean Islands off the coast of Naples, where he says the Giants (along with Typhon) were &quot;crushed&quot; under the island. At least one tradition placed Phlegra in Thessaly.

According to the geographer Pausanias, the Arcadians claimed that battle took place &quot;not at Pellene in Thrace&quot; but in the plain of Megalopolis in the central Peloponnese where &quot;rises up fire&quot;. The tradition of the battle being in Megalopolis may have been inspired by the presence of numerous gigantic bones around Megalopolis as noted by Pausanias, which in Ancient Greek times were attributed to giants, but which in modern times are known to be those of fossil Pleistocene mammals such as straight-tusked elephants, an enormous extinct elephant species formerly native to the region. Another tradition apparently placed the battle at Tartessus in Spain. Diodorus Siculus presents a war with multiple battles, with one at Pallene, one on the Phlegraean Fields, and one on Crete. Strabo mentions an account of Heracles battling Giants at Phanagoria, a Greek colony on the shores of the Black Sea. Even when, as in Apollodorus, the battle starts at one place. Individual battles between a Giant and a god might range farther afield, with Enceladus buried beneath Sicily, and Polybotes under the island of Nisyros (or Kos). Other locales associated with Giants include Attica, Corinth, Cyzicus, Lipara, Lycia, Lydia, Miletus, and Rhodes.

The presence of volcanic phenomena, and the frequent unearthing of the fossilized bones of large prehistoric animals throughout these locations may explain why such sites became associated with the Giants.

===In art===

====Sixth century BC====
From the sixth century BC onwards, the Gigantomachy was a popular and important theme in Greek art, with over six hundred representations cataloged in the &quot;Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae&quot; (&quot;LIMC&quot;).

The Gigantomachy was depicted on the new &quot;peplos&quot; (robe) presented to Athena on the Acropolis of Athens as part of the Panathenaic festival celebrating her victory over the Giants, a practice dating from perhaps as early as the second millennium BC. The earliest extant indisputable representations of Gigantes are found on votive pinakes from Corinth and Eleusis, and Attic black-figure pots, dating from the second quarter of the sixth century BC (this excludes early depictions of Zeus battling single snake-footed creatures, which probably represent his battle with Typhon, as well as Zeus&#x27; opponent on the west pediment of the Temple of Artemis on Kerkyra (modern Corfu) which is probably not a Giant).

Though all these early Attic vases are fragmentary, the many common features in their depictions of the Gigantomachy suggest that a common model or template was used as a prototype, possibly Athena&#x27;s &quot;peplos&quot;. These vases depict large battles, including most of the Olympians, and contain a central group which appears to consist of Zeus, Heracles, Athena, and sometimes Gaia. Zeus, Heracles and Athena are attacking Giants to the right. Zeus mounts a chariot brandishing his thunderbolt in his right hand, Heracles, in the chariot, bends forward with drawn bow and left foot on the chariot pole, Athena, beside the chariot, strides forward toward one or two Giants, and the four chariot horses trample a fallen Giant. When present, Gaia is shielded behind Herakles, apparently pleading with Zeus to spare her children.

On either side of the central group are the rest of the gods engaged in combat with particular Giants. While the gods can be identified by characteristic features, for example Hermes with his hat (&quot;petasos&quot;) and Dionysus his ivy crown, the Giants are not individually characterized and can only be identified by inscriptions which sometimes name the Giant. The fragments of one vase from this same period (Getty 81.AE.211) name five Giants: Pankrates against Heracles, Polybotes against Zeus, Oranion against Dionysus, Euboios and Euphorbus fallen and Ephialtes. Also named, on two other of these early vases, are Aristaeus battling Hephaestus (Akropolis 607), Eurymedon and (again) Ephialtes (Akropolis 2134). An amphora from Caere from later in the sixth century, gives the names of more Giants: Hyperbios and Agasthenes (along with Ephialtes) fighting Zeus, Harpolykos against Hera, Enceladus against Athena and (again) Polybotes, who in this case battles Poseidon with his trident holding the island of Nisyros on his shoulder (Louvre E732). This motif of Poseidon holding the island of Nisyros, ready to hurl it at his opponent, is another frequent feature of these early Gigantomachies.

The Gigantomachy was also a popular theme in late sixth century sculpture. The most comprehensive treatment is found on the north frieze of the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi (c. 525 BC), with more than thirty figures, named by inscription. From left to right, these include Hephaestus (with bellows), two females fighting two Giants; Dionysus striding toward an advancing Giant; Themis in a chariot drawn by a team of lions which are attacking a fleeing Giant; the archers Apollo and Artemis; another fleeing Giant (Tharos or possibly Kantharos); the Giant Ephialtes lying on the ground; and a group of three Giants, which include Hyperphas and Alektos, opposing Apollo and Artemis. Next comes a missing central section presumably containing Zeus, and possibly Heracles, with chariot (only parts of a team of horses remain). To the right of this comes a female stabbing her spear at a fallen Giant (probably Porphyrion); Athena fighting Eriktypos and a second Giant; a male stepping over the fallen Astarias to attack Biatas. and another Giant; and Hermes against two Giants. Then follows a gap which probably contained Poseidon and finally, on the far right, a male fighting two Giants, one fallen, the other the Giant Mimon (possibly the same as the Giant Mimas mentioned by Apollodorus).

The Gigantomachy also appeared on several other late sixth century buildings, including the west pediment of the Alkmeonid Temple of Apollo at Delphi, the pediment of the Megarian Treasury at Olympia, the east pediment of the Old Temple of Athena on the Acropolis of Athens, and the metopes of Temple F at Selinous.

====Fifth century BC====
The theme continued to be popular in the fifth century BC. A particularly fine example is found on a red-figure cup (c. 490–485 BC) by the Brygos Painter (Berlin F2293). On one side of the cup is the same central group of gods (minus Gaia) as described above: Zeus wielding his thunderbolt, stepping into a quadriga, Heracles with lion skin (behind the chariot rather than on it) drawing his (unseen) bow and, ahead, Athena thrusting her spear into a fallen Giant. On the other side are Hephaestus flinging flaming missiles of red-hot metal from two pairs of tongs, Poseidon, with Nisyros on his shoulder, stabbing a fallen Giant with his trident and Hermes with his &quot;petasos&quot; hanging in back of his head, attacking another fallen Giant. None of the Giants are named.

Phidias used the theme for the metopes of the east façade of the Parthenon (c. 445 BC) and for the interior of the shield of Athena Parthenos. Phidias&#x27; work perhaps marks the beginning of a change in the way the Giants are presented. While previously the Giants had been portrayed as typical hoplite warriors armed with the usual helmets, shields, spears and swords, in the fifth century the Giants begin to be depicted as less handsome in appearance, primitive and wild, clothed in animal skins or naked, often without armor and using boulders as weapons. A series of red-figure pots from c. 400 BC, which may have used Phidas&#x27; shield of Athena Parthenos as their model, show the Olympians fighting from above and the Giants fighting with large stones from below.

====Fourth century BC and later====

With the beginning of the fourth century BC probably comes the first portrayal of the Giants in Greek art as anything other than fully human in form, with legs that become coiled serpents having snake heads at the ends in place of feet. Such depictions were perhaps borrowed from Typhon, the monstrous son of Gaia and Tartarus, described by Hesiod as having a hundred snake heads growing from his shoulders. This snake-legged motif becomes the standard for the rest of antiquity, culminating in the monumental Gigantomachy frieze of the second century BC Pergamon Altar. Measuring nearly 400 feet long and over seven feet high, here the Gigantomachy receives its most extensive treatment, with over one hundred figures.

Although fragmentary, much of the Gigantomachy frieze has been restored. The general sequence of the figures and the identifications of most of the approximately sixty gods and goddesses have been more or less established. The names and positions of most Giants remain uncertain. Some of the names of the Giants have been determined by inscription, while their positions are often conjectured on the basis of which gods fought which Giants in Apollodorus&#x27; account.

The same central group of Zeus, Athena, Heracles and Gaia, found on many early Attic vases, also featured prominently on the Pergamon Altar. On the right side of the East frieze, the first encountered by a visitor, a winged Giant, usually identified as Alcyoneus, fights Athena. Below and to the right of Athena, Gaia rises from the ground, touching Athena&#x27;s robe in supplication. Flying above Gaia, a winged Nike crowns the victorious Athena. To the left of this grouping a snake-legged Porphyrion battles Zeus and to the left of Zeus is Heracles.

On the far left side of the East frieze, a triple Hecate with torch battles a snake-legged Giant usually identified (following Apollodorus) as Clytius. To the right lays the fallen Udaeus, shot in his left eye by an arrow from Apollo, along with Demeter who wields a pair of torches against Erysichthon.

The Giants are depicted in a variety of ways. Some Giants are fully human in form, while others are a combination of human and animal forms. Some are snake-legged, some have wings, one has bird claws, one is lion-headed, and another is bull-headed. Some Giants wear helmets, carry shields and fight with swords. Others are naked or clothed in animal skins and fight with clubs or rocks.

The large size of the frieze probably necessitated the addition of many more Giants than had been previously known. Some, like Typhon and Tityus, who were not strictly speaking Giants, were perhaps included. Others were probably invented. The partial inscription &quot;Mim&quot; may mean that the Giant Mimas was also depicted. Other less-familiar or otherwise unknown Giant names include Allektos, Chthonophylos, Eurybias, Molodros, Obrimos, Ochthaios and Olyktor.

====In post-classical art====

The subject was revived in the Renaissance, most famously in the frescos of the &quot;Sala dei Giganti&quot; in the Palazzo del Te, Mantua. These were painted around 1530 by Giulio Romano and his workshop, and aimed to give the viewer the unsettling idea that the large hall was in the process of collapsing. The subject was also popular in Northern Mannerism around 1600, especially among the Haarlem Mannerists, and continued to be painted into the 18th century.

==Symbolism, meaning and interpretations==

Historically, the myth of the Gigantomachy (as well as the Titanomachy) may reflect the &quot;triumph&quot; of the new imported gods of the invading Greek speaking peoples from the north (c. 2000 BC) over the old gods of the existing peoples of the Greek peninsula. For the Greeks, the Gigantomachy represented a victory for order over chaos—the victory of the divine order and rationalism of the Olympian gods over the discord and excessive violence of the earth-born chthonic Giants. More specifically, for sixth and fifth century BC Greeks, it represented a victory for civilization over barbarism, and as such was used by Phidias on the metopes of the Parthenon and the shield of &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot; to symbolize the victory of the Athenians over the Persians. Later the Attalids similarly used the Gigantomachy on the Pergamon Altar to symbolize their victory over the Galatians of Asia Minor.

The attempt of the Giants to overthrow the Olympians also represented the ultimate example of hubris, with the gods themselves punishing the Giants for their arrogant challenge to the gods&#x27; divine authority. The Gigantomachy can also be seen as a continuation of the struggle between Gaia (Mother Earth) and Uranus (Father Sky), and thus as part of the primal opposition between female and male. Plato compares the Gigantomachy to a philosophical dispute about existence, wherein the materialist philosophers, who believe that only physical things exist, like the Giants, wish to &quot;drag down everything from heaven and the invisible to earth&quot;.

In Latin literature, in which the Giants, the Titans, Typhon and the Aloadae are all often conflated, Gigantomachy imagery is a frequent occurrence. Cicero, while urging the acceptance of aging and death as natural and inevitable, allegorizes the Gigantomachy as &quot;fighting against Nature&quot;. The rationalist Epicurean poet Lucretius, for whom such things as lightning, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions had natural rather than divine causes, used the Gigantomachy to celebrate the victory of philosophy over mythology and superstition. In the triumph of science and reason over traditional religious belief, the Gigantomachy symbolized for him Epicurus storming heaven. In a reversal of their usual meaning, he represents the Giants as heroic rebels against the tyranny of Olympus. Virgil—reversing Lucretius&#x27; reversal—restores the conventional meaning, making the Giants once again enemies of order and civilization. Horace makes use of this same meaning to symbolize the victory of Augustus at the Battle of Actium as a victory for the civilized West over the barbaric East.

Ovid, in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, describes mankind&#x27;s moral decline through the ages of gold, silver, bronze and iron, and presents the Gigantomachy as a part of that same descent from natural order into chaos. Lucan, in his &quot;Pharsalia&quot;, which contains many Gigantomachy references, makes the Gorgon&#x27;s gaze turn the Giants into mountains. Valerius Flaccus, in his &quot;Argonautica&quot;, makes frequent use of Gigantomachy imagery, with the Argo (the world&#x27;s first ship) constituting a Gigantomachy-like offense against natural law, and example of hubristic excess.

Claudian, the fourth-century AD court poet of emperor Honorius, composed a &quot;Gigantomachia&quot; that viewed the battle as a metaphor for vast geomorphic change: &quot;The puissant company of the giants confounds all differences between things; islands abandon the deep; mountains lie hidden in the sea. Many a river is left dry or has altered its ancient course...robbed of her mountains Earth sank into level plains, parted among her own sons.&quot;

==Association with volcanoes and earthquakes==

Various locations associated with the Giants and the Gigantomachy were areas of volcanic and seismic activity (e.g. the Phlegraean Fields west of Naples), and the vanquished Gigantes (along with other &quot;giants&quot;) were said to be buried under volcanos. Their subterranean movements were said to be the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

The Giant Enceladus was thought to lay buried under Mount Etna, the volcano&#x27;s eruptions being the breath of Enceladus, and its tremors caused by the Giant rolling over from side to side beneath the mountain (the monster Typhon and the Hundred-Hander Briareus were also said to be buried under Etna). The Giant Alcyoneus along with &quot;many giants&quot; were said to lie under Mount Vesuvius, &quot;Prochyte&quot; (modern Procida), one of the volcanic Phlegraean Islands was supposed to sit atop the Giant Mimas, and Polybotes was said to lie pinned beneath the volcanic island of Nisyros, supposedly a piece of the island of Kos broken off and thrown by Poseidon.

Describing the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, which buried the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, Cassius Dio relates accounts of the appearance of many Giant-like creatures on the mountain and in the surrounding area followed by violent earthquakes and the final cataclysmic eruption, saying &quot;some thought that the Giants were rising again in revolt (for at this time also many of their forms could be discerned in the smoke and, moreover, a sound as of trumpets was heard)&quot;.

==Named Giants==

Names for the Giants can be found in ancient literary sources and inscriptions. Vian and Moore provide a list with over seventy entries, some of which are based upon inscriptions which are only partially preserved. Some of the Giants identified by name are:

*Aezeius (): His son Lycaon was possibly the maternal grandfather of a Lycaon who was king of Arcadia.
*Agrius (): According to Apollodorus, he was killed by the Moirai (Fates) with bronze clubs.
* Alcyoneus (: According to Apollodorus, he was (along with Porphyrion), the greatest of the Giants. Immortal while fighting in his native land, he was dragged from his homeland and killed by Heracles. According to Pindar, he was a herdsman and, in a separate battle from the Gigantomachy, he was killed by Heracles and Telamon, while they were traveling through Phlegra. Representations of Heracles fighting Alcyoneus are found on many sixth century BC and later works of art.
* Alektos/Allektos (): Named on the late sixth century Siphnian Treasury (Alektos), and the second century BC Pergamon Altar (Allektos).
* Aristaeus (): According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, he was the only Giant to &quot;survive&quot;. He is probably named on an Attic black-figure dinos by Lydos (Akropolis 607) dating from the second quarter of the sixth century BC, fighting Hephaestus.
* Astarias ( [See Asterius below]
* Aster () [See Asterius below]
* Asterius (: &quot;Bright one&quot; or &quot;Glitterer&quot;): A Giant (also called Aster), killed by Athena whose death, according to some accounts, was celebrated by the &quot;Panathenaea&quot;. Probably the same as the Giant Astarias named on the late sixth century Siphnian Treasury. Probably also the same as Asterus, mentioned in the epic poem &quot;Meropis&quot;, as an invulnerable warrior killed by Athena. In the poem, Heracles, while fighting the Meropes, a race of Giants, on the Island of Kos, would have been killed but for Athena&#x27;s intervention. Athena kills and flays Asterus and uses his impenetrable skin for her aegis. Other accounts name others whose hide provided Athena&#x27;s aegis: Apollodorus has Athena flay the Giant Pallas, while Euripides&#x27; &quot;Ion&quot; has &quot;the Gorgon&quot;, an offspring of Gaia born by her as an ally for the Giant, as Athena&#x27;s victim.
* Asterus () [See Asterius above]
* Clytius (): According to Apollodorus, he was killed by Hecate with her torches.

* Damysus (): The fastest of the Giants. Chiron exhumed his body, removed the ankle and incorporated it into Achilles burnt foot.
* Enceladus (): A Giant named Enceladus, fighting Athena, is attested in art as early as an Attic Black-figure pot dating from the second quarter of the sixth century BC (Louvre E732). Euripides has Athena fighting him with her &quot;Gorgon shield&quot; (her aegis). According to Apollodorus, he was crushed by Athena under the Island of Sicily. Virgil has him struck by Zeus&#x27; lightning bolt, and both Virgil and Claudian have him buried under Mount Etna (other traditions had Typhon or Briareus buried under Etna). For some Enceladus was instead buried in Italy.
* Ephialtes (): probably different from the Aload Giant who was also named Ephialtes): According to Apollodorus he was blinded by arrows from Apollo and Heracles. He is named on three Attic black-figure pots (Akropolis 2134, Getty 81.AE.211, Louvre E732) dating from the second quarter of the sixth century BC. On Louvre E732 he is, along with Hyperbios and Agasthenes, opposed by Zeus, while on Getty 81.AE.211 his opponents are apparently Apollo and Artemis. He is also named on the late sixth century BC Siphnian Treasury, where he is probably one of the opponents of Apollo and Artemis, and probably as well on what might be the earliest representation of the Gigantomachy, a pinax fragment from Eleusis (Eleusis 349). He is also named on a late fifth century BC cup from Vulci (Berlin F2531), shown battling Apollo. Although the usual opponent of Poseidon among the Giants is Polybotes, one early fifth century red-figure column krater (Vienna 688) has Poseidon attacking Ephialtes.
* Euryalus (): He is named on a late sixth century red-figure cup (Akropolis 2.211) and an early fifth century red-figure cup (British Museum E 47) fighting Hephaestos.
* Eurymedon (): According to Homer, he was a king of the Giants and father of Periboea (mother of Nausithous, king of the Phaeacians, by Poseidon), who &quot;brought destruction on his froward people&quot;. He was possibly the Eurymedon who raped Hera producing Prometheus as offspring (according to an account attributed to the Hellenistic poet Euphorion). He is probably named on Akropolis 2134. He is possibly mentioned by the Latin poet Propertius as an opponent of Jove.
* Eurytus (): According to Apollodorus, he was killed by Dionysus with his thyrsus.
* Gration (): According to Apollodorus, he was killed by Artemis. His name may have been corrupted text, as various emendations have been suggested, including Aigaion (Αἰγαίων - &quot;goatish&quot;, &quot;stormy&quot;), Eurytion (Εὐρυτίων: &quot;fine flowing&quot;, &quot;widely honored&quot;) and Rhaion (Ῥαίων - &quot;more adaptable&quot;, &quot;more relaxed&quot;).
* Hopladamas or Hopladamus ( or ): Possibly named (as &quot;Hopladamas&quot;) on two vases dating from the second quarter of the sixth century BC, on one (Akropolis 607) being speared by Apollo, while on the other (Getty 81.AE.211) attacking Zeus. Mentioned (as &quot;Hopladamus&quot;) by the geographer Pausanias as being a leader of Giants enlisted by the Titaness Rhea, pregnant with Zeus, to defend herself from her husband Cronus.
* Hippolytus (): According to Apollodorus, he was killed by Hermes, who was wearing Hades&#x27; helmet which made its wearer invisible.
* Lion or Leon (): Possibly a Giant, he is mentioned by Photius (as ascribed to Ptolemy Hephaestion) as a giant who was challenged to single combat by Heracles and killed. Lion-headed Giants are shown on the Gigantomachy frieze of the second century BC Pergamon Altar.
* Mimas (): According to Apollodorus, he was killed by Hephaestus. Euripides has Zeus burning him &quot;to ashes&quot; with his thunderbolt. According to others he was killed by Ares. &quot;Mimos&quot;—possibly in error for &quot;Mimas&quot;—is inscribed (retrograde) on Akropolis 607. He was said to be buried under Prochyte. Mimas is possibly the same as the Giant named Mimon on the late sixth century BC Siphnian Treasury, as well as on a late fifth century BC cup from Vulci (Berlin F2531) shown fighting Ares. Several depictions in Greek art, though, show Aphrodite as the opponent of Mimas.
* Mimon () [See Mimas above]
* Mimos () [See Mimas above]

* Pallas (): According to Apollodorus, he was flayed by Athena, who used his skin as a shield. Other accounts name others whose hyde provided Athena&#x27;s aegis [see Asterus above]. Claudian names Pallas as one of several Giants turned to stone by Minerva&#x27;s Gorgon shield.
* Pelorus (): According to Claudian, he was killed by Mars, the Roman equivalent of Ares.
* Picolous (): A Giant who fled the battle and came to Circe&#x27;s island and attempted to chase her away, only to be killed by Helios. It is said that the legendary moly plant first sprang forth from Picolous&#x27; blood as it seeped into the ground.
* Polybotes (): According to Apollodorus, he was crushed under Nisyros, a piece of the island of Kos broken off and thrown by Poseidon. He is named on two sixth century BC pots, on one (Getty 81.AE.211) he is opposed by Zeus, on the other (Louvre E732) he is opposed by Poseidon carrying Nisyros on his shoulder.
* Porphyrion (): According to Apollodorus, he was (along with Alcyoneus), the greatest of the Giants. He attacked Heracles and Hera but Zeus &quot;smote him with a thunderbolt, and Hercules shot him dead with an arrow.&quot; According to Pindar, who calls him &quot;king of the Giants&quot;, he was slain by an arrow from the bow of Apollo. He is named on a late fifth century BC cup from Vulci (Berlin F2531), where he is battling with Zeus. He was also probably named on the late sixth century BC Siphnian Treasury.
*Thoas or Thoon ( or ): According to Apollodorus, he was killed by the Moirai (Fates) with bronze clubs.

<doc id="78471" wikidata="Q47053" url="?curid=78471" title="Estuary">
<text>An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments and are an example of an ecotone. Estuaries are subject both to marine influences such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water, and to fluvial influences such as flows of freshwater and sediment. The mixing of seawater and freshwater provides high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.

Most existing estuaries formed during the Holocene epoch with the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when the sea level began to rise about 10,000–12,000 years ago. Estuaries are typically classified according to their geomorphological features or to water-circulation patterns. They can have many different names, such as bays, harbors, lagoons, inlets, or sounds, although some of these water bodies do not strictly meet the above definition of an estuary and could be fully saline.

Many estuaries suffer degeneration from a variety of factors including soil erosion, deforestation, overgrazing, overfishing and the filling of wetlands. Eutrophication may lead to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes; pollutants including heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs; and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion.

==Definition==

The word &quot;estuary&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;aestuarium&quot; meaning tidal inlet of the sea, which in itself is derived from the term &quot;aestus&quot;, meaning tide. There have been many definitions proposed to describe an estuary. The most widely accepted definition is: &quot;a semi-enclosed coastal body of water, which has a free connection with the open sea, and within which seawater is measurably diluted with freshwater derived from land drainage&quot;. However, this definition excludes a number of coastal water bodies such as coastal lagoons and brackish seas.

A more comprehensive definition of an estuary is &quot;a semi-enclosed body of water connected to the sea as far as the tidal limit or the salt intrusion limit and receiving freshwater runoff; however the freshwater inflow may not be perennial, the connection to the sea may be closed for part of the year and tidal influence may be negligible&quot;. This broad definition also includes fjords, lagoons, river mouths, and tidal creeks. An estuary is a dynamic ecosystem having a connection to the open sea through which the sea water enters with the rhythm of the tides. The effects of tides on estuaries can show nonlinear effects on the movement of water which can have important impacts on the ecosystem and waterflow. The seawater entering the estuary is diluted by the fresh water flowing from rivers and streams. The pattern of dilution varies between different estuaries and depends on the volume of freshwater, the tidal range, and the extent of evaporation of the water in the estuary.

==Classification based on geomorphology==

===Drowned river valleys===

Drowned river valleys are also known as coastal plain estuaries. In places where the sea level is rising relative to the land, sea water progressively penetrates into river valleys and the topography of the estuary remains similar to that of a river valley. This is the most common type of estuary in temperate climates. Well-studied estuaries include the Severn Estuary in the United Kingdom and the Ems Dollard along the Dutch-German border.

The width-to-depth ratio of these estuaries is typically large, appearing wedge-shaped (in cross-section) in the inner part and broadening and deepening seaward. Water depths rarely exceed . Examples of this type of estuary in the U.S. are the Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, and Delaware Bay along the Mid-Atlantic coast, and Galveston Bay and Tampa Bay along the Gulf Coast.

===Lagoon-type or bar-built===

Bar-built estuaries are found in a place where the deposition of sediment has kept pace with rising sea levels so that the estuaries are shallow and separated from the sea by sand spits or barrier islands. They are relatively common in tropical and subtropical locations.

These estuaries are semi-isolated from ocean waters by barrier beaches (barrier islands and barrier spits). Formation of barrier beaches partially encloses the estuary, with only narrow inlets allowing contact with the ocean waters. Bar-built estuaries typically develop on gently sloping plains located along tectonically stable edges of continents and marginal sea coasts. They are extensive along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the U.S. in areas with active coastal deposition of sediments and where tidal ranges are less than . The barrier beaches that enclose bar-built estuaries have been developed in several ways:
* building up of offshore bars by wave action, in which sand from the seafloor is deposited in elongated bars parallel to the shoreline,
* reworking of sediment discharge from rivers by a wave, current, and wind action into beaches, overwash flats, and dunes,
* engulfment of mainland beach ridges (ridges developed from the erosion of coastal plain sediments around 5000 years ago) due to sea level rise and resulting in the breaching of the ridges and flooding of the coastal lowlands, forming shallow lagoons,
* elongation of barrier spits from the erosion of headlands due to the action of longshore currents, with the spits growing in the direction of the littoral drift. 

===Fjord-type===
Fjords were formed where Pleistocene glaciers deepened and widened existing river valleys so that they become U-shaped in cross-sections. At their mouths there are typically rocks, bars or sills of glacial deposits, which have the effects of modifying the estuarine circulation.

Fjord-type estuaries are formed in deeply eroded valleys formed by glaciers. These U-shaped estuaries typically have steep sides, rock bottoms, and underwater sills contoured by glacial movement. The estuary is shallowest at its mouth, where terminal glacial moraines or rock bars form sills that restrict water flow. In the upper reaches of the estuary, the depth can exceed . The width-to-depth ratio is generally small. In estuaries with very shallow sills, tidal oscillations only affect the water down to the depth of the sill, and the waters deeper than that may remain stagnant for a very long time, so there is only an occasional exchange of the deep water of the estuary with the ocean. If the sill depth is deep, water circulation is less restricted, and there is a slow but steady exchange of water between the estuary and the ocean. Fjord-type estuaries can be found along the coasts of Alaska, the Puget Sound region of western Washington state, British Columbia, eastern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, New Zealand, Chile, and Norway.

===Tectonically produced===
These estuaries are formed by subsidence or land cut off from the ocean by land movement associated with faulting, volcanoes, and landslides. Inundation from eustatic sea-level rise during the Holocene Epoch has also contributed to the formation of these estuaries. There are only a small number of tectonically produced estuaries; one example is the San Francisco Bay, which was formed by the crustal movements of the San Andreas Fault system causing the inundation of the lower reaches of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.

==Classification based on water circulation==
===Salt wedge===
In this type of estuary, river output greatly exceeds marine input and tidal effects have minor importance. Freshwater floats on top of the seawater in a layer that gradually thins as it moves seaward. The denser seawater moves landward along the bottom of the estuary, forming a wedge-shaped layer that is thinner as it approaches land. As a velocity difference develops between the two layers, shear forces generate internal waves at the interface, mixing the seawater upward with the freshwater. An examples of a salt wedge estuary is Mississippi River and the Mandovi estuary in Goa during the monsoon period.

===Partially mixed===
As tidal forcing increases, river output becomes less than the marine input. Here, current induced turbulence causes mixing of the whole water column such that salinity varies more longitudinally rather than vertically, leading to a moderately stratified condition. Examples include the Chesapeake Bay and Narragansett Bay.

===Well-mixed===
Tidal mixing forces exceed river output, resulting in a well-mixed water column and the disappearance of the vertical salinity gradient. The freshwater-seawater boundary is eliminated due to the intense turbulent mixing and eddy effects. The lower reaches of Delaware Bay and the Raritan River in New Jersey are examples of vertically homogeneous estuaries.

===Inverse===
Inverse estuaries occur in dry climates where evaporation greatly exceeds the inflow of freshwater. A salinity maximum zone is formed, and both riverine and oceanic water flow close to the surface towards this zone. This water is pushed downward and spreads along the bottom in both the seaward and landward direction. Examples of an inverse estuary are Spencer Gulf, South Australia, Saloum River and Casamance River, Senegal.

===Intermittent===
Estuary type varies dramatically depending on freshwater input, and is capable of changing from a wholly marine embayment to any of the other estuary types.

==Physiochemical variation==
The most important variable characteristics of estuary water are the concentration of dissolved oxygen, salinity and sediment load. There is extreme spatial variability in salinity, with a range of near-zero at the tidal limit of tributary rivers to 3.4% at the estuary mouth. At any one point, the salinity will vary considerably over time and seasons, making it a harsh environment for organisms. Sediment often settles in intertidal mudflats which are extremely difficult to colonize. No points of attachment exist for algae, so vegetation based habitat is not established. Sediment can also clog feeding and respiratory structures of species, and special adaptations exist within mudflat species to cope with this problem. Lastly, dissolved oxygen variation can cause problems for life forms. Nutrient-rich sediment from human-made sources can promote primary production life cycles, perhaps leading to eventual decay removing the dissolved oxygen from the water; thus hypoxic or anoxic zones can develop.

== Implications of eutrophication on estuaries ==
=== Effects of eutrophication on biogeochemical cycles ===

Nitrogen is often the lead cause of eutrophication in estuaries in temperate zones. During a eutrophication event, biogeochemical feedback decreases the amount of available silica. These feedbacks also increase the supply of nitrogen and phosphorus, creating conditions where harmful algal blooms can persist. Given the now off-balance nitrogen cycle, estuaries can be driven to phosphorus limitation instead of nitrogen limitation. Estuaries can be severely impacted by an unbalanced phosphorus cycle, as phosphorus interacts with nitrogen and silica availability.

With an abundance of nutrients in the ecosystem, plants and algae overgrow and eventually decompose, which produce a significant amount of carbon dioxide. While releasing into the water and atmosphere, these organisms are also intaking all or nearly all of the available oxygen creating a hypoxic environment and unbalanced oxygen cycle. The excess carbon in the form of can lead to low pH levels and ocean acidification, which is more harmful for vulnerable coastal regions like estuaries.

=== Effects of eutrophication on estuarine plants ===

Eutrophication has been seen to negatively impact many plant communities in estuarine ecosystems. Salt marshes are a type of ecosystem in some estuaries that have been negatively impacted by eutrophication. Cordgrass vegetation dominates the salt marsh landscape. Excess nutrients allow the plants to grow at greater rates in above ground biomass, however less energy is allocated to the roots since nutrients is abundant. This leads to a lower biomass in the vegetation below ground which destabilizes the banks of the marsh causing increased rates of erosion. A similar phenomenon occurs in mangrove swamps, which are another potential ecosystem in estuaries. An increase in nitrogen causes an increase in shoot growth and a decrease in root growth. Weaker root systems cause a mangrove tree to be less resilient in seasons of drought, which can lead to the death of the mangrove. This shift in above ground and below ground biomass caused by eutrophication could hindered plant success in these ecosystems.

=== Effects of eutrophication on estuarine animals ===

Across all biomes, eutrophication often results in plant death but the impacts do not end there. Plant death alters the entire food web structure which can result in the death of animals within the afflicted biome. Estuaries are hotspots for biodiversity, containing a majority of commercial fish catch, making the impacts of eutrophication that much greater within estuaries. Some specific estuarine animals feel the effects of eutrophication more strongly than others. One example is the whitefish species from the European Alps. Eutrophication reduced the oxygen levels in their habitats so greatly that whitefish eggs could not survive, causing local extinctions. However, some animals, such as carnivorous fish, tend to do well in nutrient-enriched environments and can benefit from eutrophication. This can be seen in populations of bass or pikes.

=== Effects of eutrophication on human activities ===

Eutrophication can affect many marine habitats which can lead to economic consequences. The commercial fishing industry relies upon estuaries for approximately 68 percent of their catch by value because of the great biodiversity of this ecosystem. During an algal bloom, fishermen have noticed a significant increase in the quantity of fish. A sudden increase in primary productivity causes spikes in fish populations which leads to more oxygen being utilized. It is the continued deoxygenation of the water that then causes a decline in fish populations. These effects can begin in estuaries and have a wide effect on the surrounding water bodies.  In turn, this can decrease fishing industry sales in one area and across the country. Production in 2016 from recreational and commercial fishing contributes billions of dollars to the United States&#x27; gross domestic product (GDP). A decrease in production within this industry can affect any of the 1.7 million people the fishing industry employs yearly across the United States.

==Implications for marine life==
Estuaries are incredibly dynamic systems, where temperature, salinity, turbidity, depth and flow all change daily in response to the tides. This dynamism makes estuaries highly productive habitats, but also make it difficult for many species to survive year-round. As a result, estuaries large and small experience strong seasonal variation in their fish communities. In winter, the fish community is dominated by hardy marine residents, and in summer a variety of marine and anadromous fishes move into and out of estuaries, capitalizing on their high productivity. Estuaries provide a critical habitat to a variety of species that rely on estuaries for life-cycle completion. Pacific Herring (&quot;Clupea pallasii&quot;) are known to lay their eggs in estuaries and bays, surfperch give birth in estuaries, juvenile flatfish and rockfish migrate to estuaries to rear, and anadromous salmonids and lampreys use estuaries as migration corridors. Also, migratory bird populations, such as the black-tailed godwit, rely on estuaries.

Two of the main challenges of estuarine life are the variability in salinity and sedimentation. Many species of fish and invertebrates have various methods to control or conform to the shifts in salt concentrations and are termed osmoconformers and osmoregulators. Many animals also burrow to avoid predation and to live in a more stable sedimental environment. However, large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which has a very high oxygen demand. This reduces the levels of oxygen within the sediment often resulting in partially anoxic conditions, which can be further exacerbated by limited water flow.

Phytoplankton are key primary producers in estuaries. They move with the water bodies and can be flushed in and out with the tides. Their productivity is largely dependent upon the turbidity of the water. The main phytoplankton present are diatoms and dinoflagellates which are abundant in the sediment.

A primary source of food for many organisms on estuaries, including bacteria, is detritus from the settlement of the sedimentation.

==Human impact==

Of the thirty-two largest cities in the world in the early 1990s, twenty-two were located on estuaries.

As ecosystems, estuaries are under threat from human activities such as pollution and overfishing. They are also threatened by sewage, coastal settlement, land clearance and much more. Estuaries are affected by events far upstream, and concentrate materials such as pollutants and sediments. Land run-off and industrial, agricultural, and domestic waste enter rivers and are discharged into estuaries. Contaminants can be introduced which do not disintegrate rapidly in the marine environment, such as plastics, pesticides, furans, dioxins, phenols and heavy metals.

Such toxins can accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called bioaccumulation. They also accumulate in benthic environments, such as estuaries and bay muds: a geological record of human activities of the last century. The elemental composition of biofilm reflect areas of the estuary impacted by human activities, and over time may shift the basic composition of the ecosystem, and the reversible or irreversible changes in the abiotic and biotic parts of the systems from the bottom up.

For example, Chinese and Russian industrial pollution, such as phenols and heavy metals, has devastated fish stocks in the Amur River and damaged its estuary soil.

Estuaries tend to be naturally eutrophic because land runoff discharges nutrients into estuaries. With human activities, land run-off also now includes the many chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture as well as waste from livestock and humans. Excess oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water can lead to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones. This can result in reductions in water quality, fish, and other animal populations.
Overfishing also occurs. Chesapeake Bay once had a flourishing oyster population that has been almost wiped out by overfishing. Oysters filter these pollutants, and either eat them or shape them into small packets that are deposited on the bottom where they are harmless. Historically the oysters filtered the estuary&#x27;s entire water volume of excess nutrients every three or four days. Today that process takes almost a year, and sediment, nutrients, and algae can cause problems in local waters.

Some major rivers that run through deserts historically had vast, expansive estuaries that have been reduced to a fraction of their former size, because of dams and diversions. One example is the Colorado River Delta in Mexico, historically covered with marshlands and forests, but now essentially a salt flat.

<text>In Greek mythology, the name Echion (Ancient Greek: Ἐχῑ́ων (&quot;gen&quot;.: Ἐχίονος), derivative of ἔχις &quot;echis&quot; &quot;viper&quot;) referred to five different beings:

*Echion, one of the Gigantes, known for great strength (though not necessarily great size) and having an ability to change the course or direction of winds.
*Echion, one of the surviving &quot;Spartoi&quot;, the &quot;sown men&quot; that sprang up from the dragon&#x27;s teeth sown by Cadmus, the other four Spartoi were Chthonius, Hyperenor, Pelorus, and Udaeus. Echion was principally known for his skill in battle and bravery; &quot;it was Echion who, for his great valor, was preferred by Cadmus to be his son-in-law&quot;: Echion was father of Pentheus and Epeiros by Agave. He was credited to be the founder of the Malian city of Echinos. Also, Echion was said to have dedicated a temple of Cybele in Boeotia, and to have assisted Cadmus in the building of Thebes.
*Echion of Alope, son of Hermes and Antianeira (daughter of Menetus) or Laothoe, and brother of Erytus. Together with the latter and stepbrother, Aethalides, they participated in the quest of the Argonauts. Echion and his brother were described as &quot;“well skilled in craftiness”&quot; which signified the ability they possess as children of the thief-god. Also, he participated in the Calydonian boar hunt, according to Hyginus and Ovid. 
*Echion, son of Portheus and one of the Greeks who fought at the Trojan War. He was also one of the men hidden in the Trojan horse and was killed. The doomed Greek is a &quot;tough but battle weary warrior, plagued by phantasms of his death&quot;.
*Echion, one of the suitors who came with 53 others from Dulichium to compete for Penelope. He, with the other suitors, was shot dead by Odysseus with the help of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.

<doc id="78475" wikidata="Q653681" url="?curid=78475" title="Alcyoneus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Alcyoneus or Alkyoneus (; ) was a traditional opponent of the hero Heracles. He was usually considered to be one of the Gigantes (Giants), the offspring of Gaia born from the blood of the castrated Uranus.

According to the mythographer Apollodorus, Alcyoneus&#x27; confrontation with Heracles was part of the Gigantomachy, the cosmic battle of the Giants with the Olympian gods. In Apollodorus&#x27; account Alcyoneus and Porphyrion were the greatest of the Giants, and Alcyoneus was immortal as long as he was in his native land. When Heracles shot Alcyoneus with an arrow, Alcyoneus fell to the ground but then began to revive, so on the advice of Athena, Heracles dragged Alcyoneus out of his homeland where Alcyoneus then died.

For the poet Pindar, Heracles&#x27; battle with Alcyoneus (whom he calls a herdsman), and the Gigantomachy were separate events.

In some accounts Alcyoneus caused the Gigantomachy by stealing the cattle of Helios. Vase paintings suggest a version of the story in which Heracles encounters a sleeping Alcyoneus.

His seven daughters are the Alkyonides.

==Early sources==
Early sources provide glimpses of other versions of the story from the one that Apollodorus tells. Possibly Alcyoneus was not originally a Giant, but simply one of Heracles&#x27; many monstrous opponents.

===Iconography===
Depictions of Heracles fighting Alcyoneus, named by inscription, are found on several sixth century BC pots (e.g., Louvre F208). The earliest extant representation of their battle probably occurs on a metope from the first temple dedicated to Hera at Foce del Sele, which shows Heracles holding a large figure by the hair, while stabbing him with a sword. Such a scene is also depicted on several shield-band reliefs from Olympia (B 1801, B 1010).

A terracotta frieze (Basel BS 318) and the sixth century BC pots show a reclining Alcyoneus. And on some of the pots Alcyoneus is apparently sleeping, with a winged Hypnos nearby (Melborne 1730.4, Getty 84.AE.974, Munich 1784, Toledo 52.66). These depictions suggest the existence of a story in which Heracles takes advantage of a sleeping opponent.

The presence of cattle on several of the pots suggests that the story also involved cattle in some way (e.g., Tarquinia RC 2070, Taranto 7030). This last pot depicts Heracles, with a headlock perhaps dragging his opponent, which might be a representation of Heracles dragging Alcyoneus out of his homeland.

===Literature===

The earliest mentions of Alcyoneus in literature, are by the fifth century BC poet Pindar. According to Pindar, Heracles and Telamon were traveling through Phlegra, where they encountered Alcyoneus, whom Pindar describes as a &quot;herdsman ... huge as a mountain&quot;, and a &quot;great and terrible warrior&quot;. A battle occurs in which Alcyoneus &quot;laid low, by hurling a rock, twelve chariots and twice twelve horse-taming heroes who were riding in them&quot;, before finally being &quot;destroyed&quot; by the two heroes.

The participation of Telamon and other mortals in the battle, and the lack of mention of any of the gods, or other Giants, seem to imply that for Pindar, unlike apparently Apollodorus, the battle between Heracles and Alcyoneus was a separate event from the Gigantomachy. And in fact Pindar never actually calls Alcyoneus a Giant, although the description of him as &quot;huge as a mountain&quot;, his use of a rock as a weapon, and the location of the battle at Phlegra, the usual site of the Gigantomachy, all suggest that he was.

Scholia to Pindar tell us that Alcyoneus lived on the isthmus of Thrace and that he had stolen his cattle from Helios, causing the Gigantomachy, (Schol. Pindar &quot;Isthmian&quot; 6.47) and that Alcyoneus, one of the Giants, attacked Heracles, not in Thrace but at the Isthmus of Corinth, while the hero was returning with the cattle of Geryon, and that this was according to Zeus&#x27; plan because the Giants were his enemies (Schol. Pindar &quot;Nemean&quot; 4.43). The cattle shown on the sixth century pots, might thus represent either Alcyoneus&#x27; cattle stolen from Helios, or Heracles&#x27; cattle taken from Geryon. Apollodorus mentions the theft of Helios&#x27; cattle as an event of the Gigantomachy, but not the cause of it.

==Other sources==
Alcyoneus is usually identified as the winged Giant battling Athena on the Gigantomachy frieze from the Pergamon Altar.

An unascribed lyric fragment (985 PMG) calls the Giant &quot;Phlegraian Alkyoneus of Pallene, the eldest of the Gigantes [Giants]&quot;. Claudian has Alcyoneus buried under the volcanic Mount Vesuvius while Philostratus says that the bones of Alcyoneus were considered a &quot;marvel&quot; by the people living near Vesuvius, where it was said that many Giants were buried. The &quot;Suda&quot; says that Hegesander told of a myth in which Alcyoneus had seven daughters, the Alkyonides, who threw themselves into the sea when Alcyoneus died and were turned into birds, the Halcyons (kingfishers).

The late fourth century or early fifth century AD Greek poet Nonnus, in his poem &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, mentions Alcyoneus as one of the several Giants that Dionysus battles in the Gigantomachy. Nonnus has Gaia set the Giants against Dionysus, promising Alcyoneus Artemis as his wife should the Giants subdue Dionysus. Nonnus makes Alcyoneus nine cubits high, and has him fight with mountains as weapons.

<text>Dimocarpus longan, commonly known as the longan () and dragon&#x27;s eye, is a tropical tree species that produces edible fruit. It is one of the better-known tropical members of the soapberry family Sapindaceae, to which the lychee and rambutan also belong. The fruit of the longan is similar to that of the lychee, but is less aromatic in taste.

The longan (from Vietnamese &quot;long nhãn&quot; or Cantonese &quot;lùhng ngáahn&quot; , literally &#x27;dragon eye&#x27;), is so named because the black seed within the shelled fruit creates the appearance of an eyeball. The plant is native to tropical Asia and China.

== Description ==

Depending upon climate and soil type the tree may grow to over in height, but it typically stands in height and the crown is round. The trunk is thick with corky bark. The branches are long and thick, typically drooping.

The leaves are oblong and blunt-tipped, usually long and wide. The leaves are pinnately compounded and alternate. There are 6 to 9 pairs of leaflets per leaf and the upper surface is wavy and a dark, glossy-green.

The longan tree produces light-yellow inflorescences at the end of branches. The inflorescence is commonly called a panicle; they can be long, and widely branched. The small flowers have 5 to 6 sepals and brownish-yellow petals. The flower has a two-lobed pistil and 8 stamen. There are three flower types, distributed throughout the panicle; staminate (functionally male), pistillate (functionally female), and hermaphroditic flowers. Flowering occurs as a progression.

The fruit are spherical and about wide; they hang in drooping clusters. The shell is tan, thin, and leathery with tiny hairs; when firm, it can be squeezed (as in the cracking of a sunflower seed) to shell the fruit. The flesh is translucent, and the seed is large and black with a circular white spot at the base. This gives the illusion of an eye. The flesh has a musky, sweet taste, which can be compared to the flavor of lychee fruit. The seed is round, hard, and has a lacquered appearance.

The longan tree is somewhat sensitive to frost. While the species prefers temperatures that do not typically fall below , it can withstand brief temperature drops to about . Longan trees prefer sandy soil with mild levels of acidity and organic matter. Longans usually bear fruit slightly later than lychees.

==Taxonomy==

The longan is believed to originate from the mountain range between Myanmar and southern China. Other reported origins include Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, upper Myanmar, north Thailand, Kampuchea (more commonly known as Cambodia), north Vietnam and New Guinea.

Its earliest record of existence draws back to the Han dynasty in 200 BCE. The emperor had demanded lychee and longan trees to be planted in his palace gardens in Shaanxi, but the plants failed. Four hundred years later, longan trees flourished in other parts of China like Fujian and Guangdong, where longan production soon became an industry.

Later on, due to immigration and the growing demand for nostalgic foods, the longan tree was officially introduced to Australia in the mid-1800s, Thailand in the late-1800s, and Hawaii and Florida in the 1900s. The warm, sandy-soiled conditions allowed for the easy growth of longan trees. This jump-started the longan industry in these locations.

Despite its long success in China, the longan is considered to be a relatively new fruit to the world. It has only been acknowledged outside of China in the last 250 years. The first European acknowledgment of the fruit was recorded by João de Loureiro, a Portuguese Jesuit botanist, in 1790. The first entry resides in his collection of works, &quot;Flora Cochinchinensis&quot;.

=== Subspecies ===
Plants of the World Online lists:
* &quot;D. longan&quot; var. &quot;echinatus&quot; Leenhouts (Borneo, Philippines)
* &quot;D. longan&quot; var. &quot;longetiolatus&quot; Leenhouts (Viet Nam)
* &quot;D. longan&quot; subsp. &quot;malesianus&quot; Leenh. (widespread SE Asia)
* &quot;D. longan&quot; var. &quot;obtusus&quot; (Pierre) Leenh. (Indo-China)

== Conservation ==
The wild longan population have been decimated considerably by large-scale logging in the past, and the species used to be listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. If left alone, longan tree stumps will resprout and the listing was upgraded to Near Threatened in 1998. Recent field data are inadequate for a contemporary IUCN assessment.

== Diseases ==
Plant based diseases can affect both longan fruits and their trees, and the severity of these diseases can range from harmless cosmetic damage to rendering to the fruit inedible.

The most prevalent disease among longan plants is witch&#x27;s broom, which can be found in all major longan-producing Asian territories, including China, Thailand, and Vietnam. Witch&#x27;s broom deforms longan skin, and at times causes the plant to prematurely drop its fruit, similar to the &quot;Phytophthora palmivora&quot;.

Another common disease that longan trees can carry is the aptly named &quot;longan decline&quot;, which is largely prevalent in Thailand, with reports finding that it could affect up to 40% of longan trees alone. Affected trees are more vulnerable to common tree pests and algae, and often bear low-quality fruit unworthy of yield.

&quot;Algal spot&quot; is another plant disease that can affect longan plants and trees. Common among tropical fruits, the disease mainly takes form as red-orange algae that can appear on a fruit-bearing tree&#x27;s leaves or branches.&quot;Algal spot&quot; on longan plants, like many other tropical fruits, is caused by &quot;Cephaleuros virescens&quot;.

An oomycete disease that causes blight on leaves and foliage of a plant and affects the related lychee, &quot;Phytophthora palmivora&quot;, can also appear on both longan plants and fruit, particularly in the Thailand region. When affecting longan, it can create brown spots on the fruit in an erratic fashion, and can also cause longan to drop prematurely from the plant. Early symptoms can also include a dark necrosis on the plant itself.

Stem-end rot is a disease common amongst litchi and longan, and causes browning and rot on the stem of the fruit. Longan also suffer from various decay-accelerating fungi.

An oomycete disease that affects the related lychee, &quot;Phytophthora litchii&quot;, also afflicts &quot;D. longan&quot;.

==Cultivation==

Currently, longan crops are grown in southern China, Taiwan, northern Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Mauritius, the United States, and Australia.

=== Growth ===
Longan, like its sister fruit lychee, thrives in humid areas or places with high rainfall, and can grow on most types of soil that does not induce issues with water drainage. Ample temperatures are also instrumental in longan growth: while longan can resist small stretches of cool temperatures, they can be damaged or killed in longer stretches of temperatures as high as −2 degrees Celsius. Younger plants tend to be more vulnerable to the cold than those more mature.
=== Harvest ===
During harvest, pickers must climb ladders to carefully remove branches of fruit from longan trees. Longan fruit remain fresher if still attached to the branch, so efforts are made to prevent the fruit from detaching too early. Mechanical picking would damage the delicate skin of the fruit, so the preferred method is to harvest by hand. Knives and scissors are the most commonly used tools.

Fruit is picked early in the day to minimize water loss and to prevent high heat exposure, which would be damaging. The fruit is then placed into either plastic crates or bamboo baskets and taken to packaging houses, where the fruit undergo a series of checks for quality. The packaging houses are well-ventilated and shaded to prevent further decay. The process of checking and sorting are performed by workers instead of machinery. Any fruit that is split, under-ripe, or decaying is disposed of. The remaining healthy fruit is then prepared and shipped to markets.

Many companies add preservatives to canned longan. Regulations control the preserving process. The only known preservative added to canned longan is sulfur dioxide, to prevent discoloration. Fresh longan that is shipped worldwide is exposed to sulfur fumigation. Tests have shown that sulfur residues remain on the fruit skin, branches, and leaves for a few weeks. This violates many countries&#x27; limits on fumigation residue, and efforts have been made to reduce this amount.

=== Distribution ===
Longan is found commonly in most of Asia, primarily in mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam and Thailand. China, the main longan-producing country in the world, produced about of longan in 2015–2017, accounting for 70% of the world&#x27;s longan production and more than 50% of the world&#x27;s longan plots. Vietnam and Thailand produced around , respectively. Like Vietnam, Thailand&#x27;s economy relies heavily on the cultivation and shipments of longan as well as lychee. This increase in the production of longan reflects recent interest in exotic fruits in other parts of the world. However, the majority of the demand comes from Asian communities in North America, Europe and Australia.

===Yield ===
While longan yields average out to 2 to 5 tonnes per hectare, there have been observed yields of up to 19.5 tonnes per ha in Israel.

Advancements in selective breeding have allowed scientists to find a strain of longan containing a &quot;high proportion of aborted seeds&quot; at the end of a thirty-year breeding program in 2001. Studies in 2015 that aimed to aid longan breeding efforts discovered that −20 degrees Celsius is the optimal temperature for long-term storage of longan pollen, a key ingredient in enabling longan breeding programs.

== Uses ==

=== Nutrition ===
Raw longan fruit is 83% water, 15% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount, raw longan supplies 60 calories of food energy, 93% of the Daily Value (DV) of vitamin C, 11% DV of riboflavin, and no other micronutrients in appreciable quantities (table).

=== Culinary ===
The fruit is sweet, juicy, and succulent in superior agricultural varieties. The seed and the peel are not consumed. Apart from being eaten raw like other fruits, longan fruit is also often used in Asian soups, snacks, desserts, and sweet-and-sour foods, either fresh or dried, and sometimes preserved and canned in syrup. The taste is different from lychees; while longan has a drier sweetness similar to dates, lychees are often messily juicy with a more tropical, grape-like sour sweetness.

Dried longan are often used in Chinese cuisine and Chinese sweet dessert soups. In Chinese food therapy and herbal medicine, it is believed to have an effect on relaxation. In contrast with the fresh fruit, which is juicy and white, the flesh of dried longans is dark brown to almost black.

Once fermented, it can be made into longan wine.

<doc id="78478" wikidata="Q150784" url="?curid=78478" title="Canyon">
<text>A canyon (from ; archaic British English spelling: &quot;cañon&quot;), gorge or chasm, is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from weathering and the erosive activity of a river over geologic time scales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces, eventually wearing away rock layers as sediments are removed downstream. A river bed will gradually reach a baseline elevation, which is the same elevation as the body of water into which the river drains. The processes of weathering and erosion will form canyons when the river&#x27;s headwaters and estuary are at significantly different elevations, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering.

A canyon may also refer to a rift between two mountain peaks, such as those in ranges including the Rocky Mountains, the Alps, the Himalayas or the Andes. Usually, a river or stream carves out such splits between mountains. Examples of mountain-type canyons are Provo Canyon in Utah or Yosemite Valley in California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada. Canyons within mountains, or gorges that have an opening on only one side, are called box canyons. Slot canyons are very narrow canyons that often have smooth walls.

Steep-sided valleys in the seabed of the continental slope are referred to as submarine canyons. Unlike canyons on land, submarine canyons are thought to be formed by turbidity currents and landslides.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;canyon&quot; is Spanish in origin (, ), with the same meaning. The word canyon is generally used in North America, while the words &quot;gorge&quot; and &quot;ravine&quot; (French in origin) are used in Europe and Oceania, though &quot;gorge&quot; and &quot;ravine&quot; are also used in some parts of North America. In the United States, place names generally use &quot;canyon&quot; in the southwest (due to their proximity to Spanish-speaking Mexico) and &quot;gorge&quot; in the northeast (which is closer to French Canada), with the rest of the country graduating between these two according to geography. In Canada, a &quot;gorge&quot; is usually narrow while a &quot;ravine&quot; is more open and often wooded. The military-derived word &quot;defile&quot; is occasionally used in the United Kingdom. In South Africa, &quot;kloof&quot; (in Krantzkloof Nature Reserve) is used along with &quot;canyon&quot; (as in Blyde River Canyon) and &quot;gorge&quot; (in Oribi Gorge).

==Formation==

Most canyons were formed by a process of long-time erosion from a plateau or table-land level. The cliffs form because harder rock strata that are resistant to erosion and weathering remain exposed on the valley walls.

Canyons are much more common in arid areas than in wet areas because physical weathering has a more localized effect in arid zones. The wind and water from the river combine to erode and cut away less resistant materials such as shales. The freezing and expansion of water also serves to help form canyons. Water seeps into cracks between the rocks and freezes, pushing the rocks apart and eventually causing large chunks to break off the canyon walls, in a process known as frost wedging. Canyon walls are often formed of resistant sandstones or granite.
Sometimes large rivers run through canyons as the result of gradual geological uplift. These are called entrenched rivers, because they are unable to easily alter their course. In the United States, the Colorado River in the Southwest and the Snake River in the Northwest are two examples of tectonic uplift.

Canyons often form in areas of limestone rock. As limestone is soluble to a certain extent, cave systems form in the rock. When a cave system collapses, a canyon is left, as in the Mendip Hills in Somerset and Yorkshire Dales in Yorkshire, England.

===Box canyon===

A box canyon is a small canyon that is generally shorter and narrower than a river canyon, with steep walls on three sides, allowing access and egress only through the mouth of the canyon. Box canyons were frequently used in the western United States as convenient corrals, with their entrances fenced.

==Largest==
The definition of &quot;largest canyon&quot; is imprecise, because a canyon can be large by its depth, its length, or the total area of the canyon system. Also, the inaccessibility of the major canyons in the Himalaya contributes to their not being regarded as candidates for the biggest canyon. The definition of &quot;deepest canyon&quot; is similarly imprecise, especially if one includes mountain canyons, as well as canyons cut through relatively flat plateaus (which have a somewhat well-defined rim elevation).

The Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon (or Tsangpo Canyon), along the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, China, is regarded by some as the deepest canyon on Earth at . It is slightly longer than Grand Canyon in the United States. Others consider the Kali Gandaki Gorge in midwest Nepal to be the deepest canyon, with a difference between the level of the river and the peaks surrounding it.

Vying for the deepest canyon in the Americas is the Cotahuasi Canyon and Colca Canyon, in southern Peru. Both have been measured at over deep.

Grand Canyon of northern Arizona in the United States, with an average depth of and a volume of , is one of the world&#x27;s largest canyons. It was among the 28 finalists of the New 7 Wonders of Nature worldwide poll. (Some referred to it as one of the seven natural wonders of the world.)

The largest canyon in Europe is Tara River Canyon.

The largest canyon in Africa is the Fish River Canyon in Namibia.

In August 2013, the discovery of Greenland&#x27;s Grand Canyon was reported, based on the analysis of data from Operation IceBridge. It is located under an ice sheet. At long, it is believed to be the longest canyon in the world.

Despite not being quite as deep or long as Grand Canyon, the Capertee Valley in Australia is actually 1 km wider than Grand Canyon, making it the widest canyon in the world.
==Cultural significance==
Some canyons have notable cultural significance. Evidence of archaic humans has been discovered in Africa&#x27;s Olduvai Gorge. In the southwestern United States, canyons are important archeologically because of the many cliff-dwellings built in such areas, largely by the ancient Pueblo people who were their first inhabitants.

<text>Evapotranspiration (ET) refers to the combined processes which move water from the Earth&#x27;s surface (open water and ice surfaces, bare soil and vegetation) into the atmosphere. It covers both water evaporation (movement of water to the air directly from soil, canopies, and water bodies) and transpiration (evaporation that occurs through the stomata, or openings, in plant leaves). Evapotranspiration is an important part of the local water cycle and climate, and measurement of it plays a key role in water resource management agricultural irrigation.

== Definition ==
&quot;Evapotranspiration&quot; is defined as: &quot;The combined processes through which water is transferred to the atmosphere from open water and ice surfaces, bare soil and vegetation that make up the Earth’s surface.&quot;

Evapotranspiration is a combination of evaporation and transpiration, measured in order to better understand crop water requirements, irrigation scheduling, and watershed management. The two key components of evapotranspiration are:

* Evaporation: the movement of water directly to the air from sources such as the soil and water bodies. It can be affected by factors including heat, humidity, solar radiation and wind speed.
* Transpiration: the movement of water from root systems, through a plant, and exit into the air as water vapor. This exit occurs through stomata in the plant. Rate of transpiration can be influenced by factors including plant type, soil type, weather conditions and water content, and also cultivation practices.

Evapotranspiration is typically measured in millimeters of water (i.e. volume of water moved per unit area of the Earth&#x27;s surface) in a set unit of time. Globally, it is estimated that on average between three-fifths and three-quarters of land precipitation is returned to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration.

Evapotranspiration does not, in general, account for other mechanisms which are involved in returning water to the atmosphere, though some of these, such as snow and ice sublimation in regions of high elevation or high latitude, can make a large contribution to atmospheric moisture even under standard conditions.

== Influencing factors ==

=== Primary factors ===
Levels of evapotranspiration in a given area are primarily controlled by three factors: Firstly, the amount of water present. Secondly, the amount of energy present in the air and soil (e.g. heat, measured by the global surface temperature); and thirdly the ability of the atmosphere to take up water (humidity).

Regarding the second factor (energy and heat): climate change has increased global temperatures (see instrumental temperature record). This global warming has increased evapotranspiration over land. The increased evapotranspiration is one of the effects of climate change on the water cycle.

=== Secondary factors ===
==== Vegetation type ====
Vegetation type impacts levels of evapotranspiration. For example, herbaceous plants generally transpire less than woody plants, because they usually have less extensive foliage. Also, plants with deep reaching roots can transpire water more constantly, because those roots can pull more water into the plant and leaves. Another example is that conifer forests tend to have higher rates of evapotranspiration than deciduous broadleaf forests, particularly in the dormant winter and early spring seasons, because they are evergreen.

==== Vegetation coverage ====
Transpiration is a larger component of evapotranspiration (relative to evaporation) in vegetation-abundant areas. As a result, denser vegetation, like forests, may increase evapotranspiration and reduce water yield.

Two exceptions to this are cloud forests and rainforests. In cloud forests, trees collect the liquid water in fog or low clouds onto their surface, which eventually drips down to the ground. These trees still contribute to evapotranspiration, but often collect more water than they evaporate or transpire. In rainforests, water yield is increased (compared to cleared, unforested land in the same climatic zone) as evapotranspiration increases humidity within the forest (a portion of which condenses and returns quickly as precipitation experienced at ground level as rain). The density of the vegetation blocks sunlight and reduces temperatures at ground level (thereby reducing losses due to surface evaporation), and reduces wind speeds (thereby reducing the loss of airborne moisture). The combined effect results in increased surface stream flows and a higher ground water table whilst the rainforest is preserved. Clearing of rainforests frequently leads to desertification as ground level temperatures and wind speeds increase, vegetation cover is lost or intentionally destroyed by clearing and burning, soil moisture is reduced by wind, and soils are easily eroded by high wind and rainfall events.

==== Soil and irrigation ====

In areas that are not irrigated, actual evapotranspiration is usually no greater than precipitation, with some buffer and variations in time depending on the soil&#x27;s ability to hold water. It will usually be less because some water will be lost due to percolation or surface runoff. An exception is areas with high water tables, where capillary action can cause water from the groundwater to rise through the soil matrix back to the surface. If potential evapotranspiration is greater than the actual precipitation, then soil will dry out until conditions stabilize, unless irrigation is used.

== Measurements ==
=== Direct measurement ===
Evapotranspiration can be measured directly with a weighing or pan lysimeter. A lysimeter continuously measures the weight of a plant and associated soil, and any water added by precipitation or irrigation. The change in storage of water in the soil is then modeled by measuring the change in weight. When used properly, this allows for precise measurement of evapotranspiration over small areas.

=== Indirect estimation ===
Because atmospheric vapor flux is difficult or time-consuming to measure directly, evapotranspiration is typically estimated by one of several different methods that do not rely on direct measurement.

==== Catchment water balance ====
Evapotranspiration may be estimated by evaluating the water balance equation for a given area:. The water balance equation relates the change in water stored within the basin (&quot;S&quot;) to its input and outputs:

formula_1

In the equation, the change in water stored within the basin (&quot;ΔS&quot;) is related to precipitation (&quot;P&quot;) (water going into the basin), and evapotranspiration (&quot;ET&quot;), streamflow (&quot;Q&quot;), and groundwater recharge (&quot;D&quot;) (water leaving the basin). By rearranging the equation, ET can be estimated if values for the other variables are known:

formula_2

====Energy balance====
A second methodology for estimation is by calculating the energy balance.

formula_3

where &quot;λE&quot; is the energy needed to change the phase of water from liquid to gas, &quot;Rn&quot; is the net radiation, &quot;G&quot; is the soil heat flux and &quot;H&quot; is the sensible heat flux. Using instruments like a scintillometer, soil heat flux plates or radiation meters, the components of the energy balance can be calculated and the energy available for actual evapotranspiration can be solved.

The SEBAL and METRIC algorithms solve for the energy balance at the Earth&#x27;s surface using satellite imagery. This allows for both actual and potential evapotranspiration to be calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Evapotranspiration is a key indicator for water management and irrigation performance. SEBAL and METRIC can map these key indicators in time and space, for days, weeks or years.

==== Estimation from meteorological data ====
Given meteorological data like wind, temperature, and humidity, reference ET can be calculated. The most general and widely used equation for calculating reference ET is the Penman equation. The Penman–Monteith variation is recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the American Society of Civil Engineers. The simpler Blaney–Criddle equation was popular in the Western United States for many years but it is not as accurate in wet regions with higher humidity. Other equations for estimating evapotranspiration from meteorological data include the Makkink equation, which is simple but must be calibrated to a specific location, and the Hargreaves equations.

To convert the reference evapotranspiration to the actual crop evapotranspiration, a crop coefficient and a stress coefficient must be used. Crop coefficients, as used in many hydrological models, usually change over the year because crops are seasonal and, in general, plant behaviour varies over the year: perennial plants mature over multiple seasons, while annuals do not survive more than a few, so stress responses can significantly depend upon many aspects of plant type and condition.

<text>Wilfred Edward Shewell-Cooper (15 September 1900 – 21 February 1982) was a British organic gardener and pioneer of no-dig gardening. He wrote and published many books, including &quot;Soil, Humus and Health&quot; (1975), &quot;The Royal Gardeners&quot; (1952), &quot;Grow Your Own Food Supply&quot; (1939), and &quot;The ABC of Vegetable Gardening&quot; (1937). In 1966, he founded the Good Gardeners Association. For many years, his gardens at Arkley Manor were open to the public, allowing the results of his no-dig methods, indicated by a symbol featuring a robin resting on a spade handle, to be seen first-hand.

== Childhood and education ==

Shewell-Cooper was born in Waltham Abbey, Essex in 1900. His father, E. Shewell-Cooper, was a major in the Royal Artillery and was also the assistant superintendent of the gunpowder factory in Waltham Abbey. From there, the family moved to Blackheath, London, and then to Penarth, Wales. Before the outbreak of World War I, the family set sail on the &quot;Galaka&quot; for South Africa, where they lived in Rondebosch, now a suburb of Cape Town. While there, he went to school at Diocesan College. When he returned to England, he attended Monkton Combe School just outside Bath.

== Family and career ==

Shewell-Cooper married Irene Ramsey Pennicott in 1925. He was a prolific author of gardening books and together they wrote a cookery book called &quot;Cook What You Grow&quot; (1940). They had two sons, Ramsay and Jeremy.

Over the course of his life, Shewell-Cooper held a number of positions, some of which are listed below:

* Command Horticultural Officer, S.E. and Eastern Commands (1940–1948)
* Principal of the Thaxted Horticultural College (1950–1960)
* Fellow of the Horticultural Society of Vienna (1952)
* Director of the Horticultural Educational and Advisory Bureau (1960)
* Hon. Superintendent of the Swanley Horticultural College
* Horticultural advisor to the Warwickshire and Cheshire County Councils (1928)
* Hon. Treasurer of the Westbank House, Hextable (1937–1938)
* Garden editor of the BBC North Region

In 1964, Shewell-Cooper was appointed a Commander of the Order of Agricultural Merit by the French Government and given an award. The honour is the highest to be given by the French Government to a horticulturist.

== Arkley Manor ==
In 1960, Sir John Laing suggested that Shewell-Cooper move to Arkley Manor; this was his home until his death in 1982.

==Legacy==

Ramsay Shewell-Cooper, who died in 2016, continued to promote his father&#x27;s no-dig gardening approach and, as of 2008, a demonstration plot was to be seen at Capel Manor College in Enfield, in conjunction with the Good Gardeners&#x27; Association.

<text>Megaera ( ; ) is one of the Erinyes, Eumenides or &quot;Furies&quot; in Greek mythology. &quot;Bibliotheca Classica&quot; states &quot;According to the most received opinions, they were three in number, Tisiphone, &quot;Megaera ... daughter of Nyx and Acheron&quot;, and Alecto&quot;.

In other versions, she and her sisters, as well as the Meliae, were born of the blood of Uranus when Cronus castrated him.

In modern French (), Portuguese (), Modern Greek (), Italian (), Polish (), Russian (), Ukrainian () and Czech (), this name denotes a jealous or spiteful woman. She is not to be confused with Megara, the wife of Heracles.

== Cultural depictions ==
Minor planet 464 Megaira is named in her honour.

The 1964 Hammer horror film &quot;The Gorgon&quot; revolves around the re-emergence of Megaera in a Central European village circa 1910.

Magaera is one of the main characters in the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Ye Gods&quot;, which depicts her as the true love of Cupid.

Megaera is a major character in the video game &quot;Hades&quot;. She is a boss and a potential romance partner to Zagreus, the main character.

Megaera is one of the three antagonists in the video game &quot;God of War: Ascension&quot; where she is portrayed as a deformed humanoid with spider like appendages.

<text>A rock shelter (also rockhouse, crepuscular cave, bluff shelter, or abri) is a shallow cave-like opening at the base of a bluff or cliff. In contrast to solutional caves (karst), which are often many miles long or wide, rock shelters are almost always modest in size and extent.

==Formation==
Rock shelters form because a rock stratum such as sandstone that is resistant to erosion and weathering has formed a cliff or bluff, but a softer stratum, more subject to erosion and weathering, lies just below the resistant stratum, and thus undercuts the cliff.

In arid areas, wind erosion (Aeolian erosion) can be an important factor in rockhouse formation. In most humid areas, the most important factor in rockhouse formation is frost spalling, where the softer, more porous rock underneath is pushed off, tiny pieces at a time, by frost expansion from water frozen in the pores. Erosion from moving water is seldom a significant factor.

Many rock shelters are found under waterfalls.

==Human habitat==

Rock shelters are often important archaeologically. Because rock shelters form natural shelters from the weather, prehistoric humans often used them as living-places, and left behind debris, tools, and other artifacts. In mountainous areas the shelters can also be important for mountaineers.

Transhumant nomads, people who move with their livestock - often from lower permanent winter residences in the valleys to higher summer pastures - frequently build semi-permanent camps, often of rocks.

In western Connecticut and eastern New York, many rock shelters are known by the colloquialism &quot;leatherman caves&quot;, as they were inhabited by the Leatherman over three decades in the late 19th century.

==Unique vegetation==
The Cumberland stitchwort (&quot;Minuartia cumberlandensis&quot;) is an endangered species of plant which is found only in rock shelters in Kentucky and Tennessee.

<doc id="78490" wikidata="Q170332" url="?curid=78490" title="Exosphere">
<text>The exosphere is a thin, atmosphere-like volume surrounding a planet or natural satellite where molecules are gravitationally bound to that body, but where the density is so low that the molecules are essentially collision-less. In the case of bodies with substantial atmospheres, such as Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the exosphere is the uppermost layer, where the atmosphere thins out and merges with outer space. It is located directly above the thermosphere. Very little is known about it due to a lack of research. Mercury, the Moon, Ceres, Europa, and Ganymede have surface boundary exospheres, which are exospheres without a denser atmosphere underneath. The Earth&#x27;s exosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with some heavier atoms and molecules near the base.

==Surface boundary exosphere==
Mercury, Ceres and several large natural satellites, such as the Moon, Europa, and Ganymede, have exospheres without a denser atmosphere underneath, referred to as a surface boundary exosphere. Here, molecules are ejected on elliptic trajectories until they collide with the surface. Smaller bodies such as asteroids, in which the molecules emitted from the surface escape to space, are not considered to have exospheres.

==Earth&#x27;s exosphere==

The most common molecules within Earth&#x27;s exosphere are those of the lightest atmospheric gases. Hydrogen is present throughout the exosphere, with some helium, carbon dioxide, and atomic oxygen near its base. Because it can be hard to define the boundary between the exosphere and outer space, the exosphere may be considered a part of the interplanetary medium or outer space.

Earth&#x27;s exosphere produces Earth&#x27;s geocorona.

===Lower boundary===

The lower boundary of the exosphere is called the &quot;thermopause&quot; or &quot;exobase&quot;. It is also called the &quot;critical altitude&quot;, as this is the altitude where barometric conditions no longer apply. Atmospheric temperature becomes nearly a constant above this altitude. On Earth, the altitude of the exobase ranges from about depending on solar activity.

The exobase can be defined in one of two ways:

If we define the exobase as the height at which upward-traveling molecules experience one collision on average, then at this position the mean free path of a molecule is equal to one pressure scale height. This is shown in the following. Consider a volume of air, with horizontal area formula_1 and height equal to the mean free path formula_2, at pressure formula_3 and temperature formula_4. For an ideal gas, the number of molecules contained in it is:
: formula_5

where formula_6 is the Boltzmann constant. From the requirement that each molecule traveling upward undergoes on average one collision, the pressure is:

: formula_7

where formula_8 is the mean molecular mass of the gas. Solving these two equations gives:

: formula_9

which is the equation for the pressure scale height. As the pressure scale height is almost equal to the density scale height of the primary constituent, and because the Knudsen number is the ratio of mean free path and typical density fluctuation scale, this means that the exobase lies in the region where formula_10.

The fluctuation in the height of the exobase is important because this provides atmospheric drag on satellites, eventually causing them to fall from orbit if no action is taken to maintain the orbit.

===Upper boundary===

In principle, the exosphere covers distances where particles are still gravitationally bound to Earth, i.e. particles still have ballistic orbits that will take them back towards Earth. The upper boundary of the exosphere can be defined as the distance at which the influence of solar radiation pressure on atomic hydrogen exceeds that of Earth&#x27;s gravitational pull. This happens at half the distance to the Moon or somewhere in the neighborhood of . The exosphere, observable from space as the geocorona, is seen to extend to at least from Earth&#x27;s surface.

==Exosphere of other celestial bodies==
If the atmosphere of a celestial body is very tenuous, like the atmosphere of the Moon or that of Mercury, the whole atmosphere is considered exosphere.

=== The Exosphere of Mercury ===
Many hypotheses exist about the formation of the surface boundary exosphere of Mercury, which has been noted to include elements such as sodium (Na), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca). Each material has been suggested as a result of processes such as impacts, solar wind, and degassing from the terrestrial body that cause the atoms or molecules to form the planet&#x27;s exosphere.

Meteoroids have been reported to commonly impact the surface of Mercury at speeds ranging up to 80 km/s, which are capable of causing vaporization of both the meteor and surface regolith upon contact. These expulsions can result in clouds of mixed materials due to the force of the impact, which are capable of transporting gaseous materials and compounds to Mercury&#x27;s exosphere. During the impact, the former elements of the colliding bodies are mostly devolved into atoms rather than molecules that can then be reformed during a cooling, quenching process. Such materials have been observed as Na, NaOH, and O2. However, it is theorized that, though different forms of sodium have been released into the Mercury exosphere via meteor impact, it is a small driver for the concentration of both sodium and potassium atoms overall. Calcium is more likely to be a result of impacts, though its transport is thought to be completed through photolysis of its former oxides or hydroxides rather than atoms released during the moment of impact such as sodium, potassium, and iron (Fe).  

Another possible method of the exosphere formation of Mercury is due to its unique magnetosphere and solar wind relationship. The magnetosphere of this celestial body is hypothesized to be an incomplete shield from the weathering of solar wind. If accurate, there are openings in the magnetosphere in which solar wind is able to surpass the magnetosphere, reach the body of Mercury, and sputter the components of the surface that become possible sources of material in the exosphere. The weathering is capable of eroding the elements, such as sodium, and transporting them to the atmosphere. However, this occurrence is not constant, and it is unable to account for all atoms or molecules of the exosphere.

<text>Tisiphone (, &quot;Avenger of murder&quot;), or Tilphousia, was one of the three Erinyes or Furies in Greek mythology. Her sisters were Alecto and Megaera. They resided in the Greek underworld and ascended to earth in pursuit of the wicked. She and her sisters punished crimes of murder: parricide, fratricide and homicide.

==In culture==

===Literature===

* In book I poem 3 of Tibullus&#x27;s elegies, Tisiphone, unkempt with fierce snakes instead of hair, chases impious souls here and there in Tartarus.
* In Book VI of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, she is described as the guardian of the gates of Tartarus, &quot;clothed in a blood-wet dress&quot;.
* In Book X of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, she is described as &quot;pale&quot; and raging &quot;among the warring thousands&quot; during the battle between Mezentius and Aeneas&#x27;s men.
* In Book IV of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, she is described as a denizen of Dis who wears a dripping red robe and who has a serpent coiled around her waist. At the behest of Juno, Tisiphone drives Athamas and Ino mad with the breath of a serpent extracted from her hair and a poison made from froth from the mouth of Cerberus and Echidna&#x27;s venom.
* Tisiphone has a prominent role in Statius&#x27; &quot;Thebaid&quot;, where she spurs on the war between Polynices and Eteocles at the behest of their father, Oedipus. One of her more gruesome feats in the epic is to drive the hero, Tydeus, to cannibalism. In a bizarrely pastoral scene, Tisiphone first appears in the epic lounging beside the Cocytus river in the underworld, letting her serpent locks lap at the sulfuric waters.
* According to one myth, she fell in love with a mortal, Cithaeron, but was spurned; in her anger she formed a poisonous snake from her hair, which bit and killed him.
* In Book I of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;, the narrator calls upon her to help him to write the tragedy properly.
* In Canto IX of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, she appears with her sisters before the gates of Dis, threatening to unveil the Medusa.
* In Henry Fielding’s &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (Book I, ch. VIII), Bridget smiles “one of those smiles which might be supposed to have come from the dimpled cheeks of the august Tisiphone.”
* In the David Weber space opera &quot;In Fury Born&quot;, Tisiphone appears as an ancient Greek spirit who is mind-melded with a super-soldier Alicia Devries, and they (along with a starship AI named Megaera) save the universe from evil pirates.
* In Evie Shockley&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Suddenly We&quot;, the final stanza of the poem &quot;breonna taylor&#x27;s final rest (or, the furies are still activists)&quot; invokes Tisiphone in her role as avenger of murder victims.
* In Warhammer 40k, at the beginning of the 31st millennium the first official execution of a traitor in the Imperium is accomplished with a Power Sword named Tisiphone, made for former Luna Wolves Legionary Iacton Qruze and lent to Primarch Rogal Dorn for that purpose.

===Ships===

* was a fire ship of the Royal Navy launched in 1781 and sold for breaking up in 1816.

===Astronomy===

* Minor planet 466 Tisiphone is named after her.

===Video games===
* In 2020&#x27;s &quot;Hades&quot;, Tisiphone appears, along with Megaera and Alecto, as one of the three potential Fury boss fights during an escape attempt. She is depicted wearing a mask and can initially only speak the words &quot;murder&quot; or &quot;murderer&quot;, though she eventually learns protagonist Zagreus&#x27;s name if confronted enough times. In her Codex entry, Achilles describes her as the most frightening of the Furies, and &quot;probably responsible for the particularly fearsome reputation they all share&quot;, thanks to &quot;least [sharing] the qualities with which mortals can identify&quot;.
* In 2013&#x27;s &quot;God of War: Ascension&quot;, Tisiphone appears as one of the secondary antagonists, voiced by Debi Mae West. Tisiphone was one of the Furies and the sister of Alecto and Megaera, and possessed shape-shifting powers.
* In &quot;Gods of Olympus&quot;, she is portrayed as someone with icy abilities. She wields an icy longsword, similar to her sister, Alecto&#x27;s, which is fiery.

<text>A natural arch, natural bridge, or (less commonly) rock arch is a natural landform where an arch has formed with an opening underneath. Natural arches commonly form where inland cliffs, coastal cliffs, fins or stacks are subject to erosion from the sea, rivers or weathering (subaerial processes).

Most natural arches are formed from narrow fins and sea stacks composed of sandstone or limestone with steep, often vertical, cliff faces. The formations become narrower due to erosion over geologic time scales. The softer rock stratum erodes away creating rock shelters, or alcoves, on opposite sides of the formation beneath the relatively harder stratum, or caprock, above it. The alcoves erode further into the formation eventually meeting underneath the harder caprock layer, thus creating an arch. The erosional processes exploit weaknesses in the softer rock layers making cracks larger and removing material more quickly than the caprock; however, the caprock itself continues to erode after an arch has formed, which will ultimately lead to collapse.

The choice between &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;arch&quot; is somewhat arbitrary. The Natural Arch and Bridge Society identifies a bridge as a subtype of arch that is primarily water-formed. By contrast, the &quot;Dictionary of Geological Terms&quot; defines a natural bridge as a &quot;natural arch that spans a valley of erosion.&quot;

The largest natural arch, by a significant margin, is the Xianren Bridge in China, with a span of .

==Coastline==
On coasts two different types of arches can form depending on the geology. On discordant coastlines rock types run at 90° to the coast. Wave refraction concentrates the wave energy on the headland, and an arch forms when caves break through the headland. Two examples of this type of arch are London Bridge in Victoria, Australia, and Neill Island in the Andaman Islands, India. When these arches eventually collapse, they form stacks and stumps. On concordant coastlines rock types run parallel to the coastline, with weak rock such as shale protected by stronger rock such as limestone. The wave action along concordant coastlines breaks through the strong rock and then erodes the weak rock very quickly. Good examples of this type of arch are the Durdle Door and Stair Hole near Lulworth Cove on Dorset&#x27;s Jurassic Coast in south England. When Stair Hole eventually collapses it will form a cove.

==Weather-eroded arches==

Weather-eroded arches begin their formation as deep cracks which penetrate into a sandstone layer. Erosion occurring within the cracks wears away exposed rock layers and enlarges the surface cracks isolating narrow sandstone walls which are called fins. Alternating frosts and thawing cause crumbling and flaking of the porous sandstone and eventually cut through some of the fins. The resulting holes become enlarged to arch proportions by rockfalls and weathering. The arches eventually collapse leaving only buttresses that in time will erode.

Many weather-eroded arches are found in Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, and Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument (GSENM), all located in southern Utah, United States.
==Water-eroded arches==

Some natural bridges may look like arches, but they form in the path of streams that wear away and penetrate the rock. Pothole arches form by chemical weathering as water collects in natural depressions and eventually cuts through to the layer below.

Natural Bridges National Monument in Utah protects the area surrounding three large natural bridges, all of which were formed by streams running through canyons, the largest of which is named Sipapu Bridge with a span of . The Rainbow Bridge National Monument&#x27;s namesake was also formed by flowing water which created the largest known natural bridge in the Western Hemisphere with a span of , based on a laser measurement made in 2007. Xianren Bridge, also known as Fairy Bridge, in Guangxi, China is currently the world&#x27;s largest known natural bridge with a span recorded at by the &quot;Natural Arch and Bridge Society&quot; in October 2010, with a precision of ±.

==Cave erosion==

Natural bridges can form from natural limestone caves, where paired sinkholes collapse and a ridge of stone is left standing in between, with the cave passageway connecting from sinkhole to sinkhole.

Like all rock formations, natural bridges are subject to continued erosion, and will eventually collapse and disappear. One example of this was the double-arched Victorian coastal rock formation, London Bridge, which lost an arch after storms increased erosion.

Moon Hill in Yangshuo, Guizhou Province, China, is an example of an arch formed by the remnant of a karst limestone cave.

==Arches as highway or railway bridges==

In a few places in the world, natural arches are utilized by humans as transportation bridges with highways or railroads running across them.

In Virginia, US Route 11 traverses Natural Bridge. Two additional natural arch roadways are found in Kentucky. The first, a cave erosion arch made of limestone, is in Carter Caves State Resort Park and has a paved road on top. The second, a weather-eroded sandstone arch with a dirt road on top, is on the edge of Natural Bridge State Park in Kentucky. The latter arch is called White&#x27;s Branch Arch (also known as the Narrows) and the road going over it is usually referred to as the Narrows Road.

In Europe, the Romanian village of Ponoarele has a road segment called God&#x27;s Bridge that is long and wide, passing over a stone arch high and thick.

The railroad from Lima, Peru crosses the Rio Yauli on a natural bridge near kilometer 214.2 as it approaches the city of La Oroya.

<doc id="78497" wikidata="Q737570" url="?curid=78497" title="Jeff Noon">
<text>Jeff Noon (born 1957 in Droylsden, Lancashire, England) is a British novelist, short story writer and playwright whose works make use of word play and fantasy. Noon&#x27;s speculative fiction books have ties to the works of writers such as Lewis Carroll and Jorge Luis Borges. Prior to his relocation in 2000 to Brighton, Noon set most of his stories in some version of his native city of Manchester.

==Novels==
Noon&#x27;s first four novels, which share ongoing characters and settings, are commonly referred to as the &#x27;Vurt series&#x27; (after the first novel).
Although the fictional chronology leads from &quot;Automated Alice&quot; to &quot;Nymphomation&quot; to &quot;Vurt&quot; to &quot;Pollen&quot;, the books were originally published as &quot;Vurt&quot; (1993), &quot;Pollen&quot; (1995), &quot;Automated Alice&quot; (1996), and &quot;Nymphomation&quot; (1997). (&quot;Automated Alice&quot; connects the series to the fictional world of Lewis Carroll), serving as a &#x27;trequel&#x27; to Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; )

===&quot;Vurt&quot; (1993)===
&quot;Vurt&quot; tells the story of Scribble and his &quot;gang&quot; the Stash Riders as they search for his missing sister Desdemona. &quot;Vurt&quot; refers to a drug/shared alternate reality that is accessed by sucking on colour-coded feathers. Through some (never explained) mechanism, the dreams, mythology, and imaginings of humanity achieved objective reality in the &quot;Vurt&quot; and became &quot;real&quot;. The book won the 1994 Arthur C. Clarke Award.

===&quot;Pollen&quot; (1995)===
&quot;Pollen&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Vurt&quot; and concerns the ongoing struggle between the real world and the &quot; world. When concerning the &quot; world, some references to Greek mythology are noticeable, including Persephone and Demeter, the river Styx and Charon, and Hades (portrayed by the character John Barleycorn).

===&quot;Automated Alice&quot; (1996)===
Noon describes &quot;Automated Alice&quot; as a &quot;trequel&quot; – it is a companion piece of sorts to Lewis Carroll&#x27;s books &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. The novella follows Alice&#x27;s journey to a future Manchester populated by Newmonians, Civil Serpents and a vanishing cat named Quark.

The people who suffer from &quot;&quot; (pronounced the same as the real condition pneumonia), are hybrids of humans and other entities. They are mainly hybrids of animals and humans, but also of other random items such as kitchen sinks and pianos.

The &quot;civil serpents&quot; (a play-on-words of the job &#x27;civil servant&#x27;) are trying to control everything that happens in the future, and try to stop randomness. The &#x27;Supreme Serpent&#x27; is the controller of the serpents, and hints at the fact that he is Satan himself.
The writing style of Noon is very similar to that of Lewis Carroll, who Noon constantly refers back to during the novel. The narrative is full of Alice mis-hearing words, most notably &quot;worm&quot; instead of &quot;wurm&quot;, and &quot;pneumonia&quot; instead of &quot;&quot;.

There are also references to popular musical figures, with two notable characters. Firstly, James Marshall Hentrails, a sculpture made of rubbish, and who contains the insides (entrails) of a hen. This character is obviously a reference to Jimi Hendrix. The character also sings a song while playing the guitar. The song is titled &#x27;Little Miss Bonkers&#x27;, a reference to &#x27;Little Miss Strange&#x27; by Hendrix.

Secondly, the character of Long Distance Davis, who Alice meets in a police cell, is a reference to jazz musician and trumpet player Miles Davis.

===&quot;Nymphomation&quot; (1997)===
&quot;Nymphomation&quot; is the prequel to &quot;Vurt&quot;. &quot;Nymphomation&quot; primarily tells the story of a lottery in Manchester involving dominos and a group attempting to crack the secrets of that lottery, but it also sets the background for much of the mythology found in the previous three books.

===&quot;Pixel Juice&quot; (1998)===
Pixel Juice is a collection of fifty short stories.

===&quot;Needle in the Groove&quot; (2000)===
&quot;Needle in the Groove&quot; follows Elliot Hill, a bass player and ex-junkie trudging the pub-rock circuit, who is invited to join a new band: fusing DJ artistry, voice and rhythm section, the group&#x27;s hypnotic groove creation is augmented by a startling new recording technology. The band seems bound for success – until one of them vanishes. Elliot&#x27;s subsequent search draws him into a secret history of music that stretches back forty years and into his own past.
Jeff Noon and David Toop also released a CD, &quot;Needle in the Groove: if music were a drug, where would it take you&quot;, on Sulphur Records in the same year.

===&quot;Cobralingus&quot; (2001)===
&quot;Cobralingus&quot; sits apart from Noon&#x27;s other published works. It is part anthology of poems and part instructional textbook for Noon&#x27;s style of poetry. In it, he details his regimented methods for the creation of poetic text by a style of word play which lends its name to the title. Also included are various exemplars of this style.

The Engine begins with Noon using an existing text and then applying different &#x27;filter gates&#x27; that edit the text into something new. Examples of these gates include &#x27;enhance&#x27; which creates elements of beauty in the text, and &#x27;ghost edit&#x27;; this kills the text and calls up a ghost to haunt the text.

The &quot;Codex&quot; edition of the book was illustrated by Daniel Allington and has an introduction by Michael Bracewell, explaining the &quot;Cobralingus Engine&quot;.

===&quot;Falling out of Cars &quot; (2002)===
&quot;Falling out of Cars&quot; is a road novel set in a near-future world where information-based civilization is falling apart. It follows the journey of Marlene, Henderson, and Peacock as they drive around England on a mission to gather fragments of a mirror that may be at the heart of the world&#x27;s affliction. &quot;Falling out of Cars&quot; is the record Marlene keeps – or tries to keep – of her quest to flee from her past. Despite her daily dose of Lucidity, Marlene is gradually succumbing to the malady, and it gets harder and harder to distinguish dream from reality, hallucinations from events.

===&quot;217 Babel Street&quot; (2008)===

&quot;217 Babel Street&quot; was a collaborative project between four authors, Susanna Jones, Alison MacLeod, William Shaw and Noon. Only published online, this collection of short stories is set in a fictional British apartment building and features stories about the lives of each inhabitant, to which each author contributed. No longer available online.

===&quot;Channel SK1N&quot; (2012)===

&quot;Channel SK1N&quot; follows popstar Nola Blue on a journey of transformation as she begins to pick up signals on her skin. It was published as a DRM-free ebook.

<doc id="78498" wikidata="Q8433" url="?curid=78498" title="Philip V of France">
<text>Philip V ( 1291 – 3 January 1322), known as the Tall (), was King of France and Navarre (as Philip II) from 1316 to 1322. Philip engaged in a series of domestic reforms intended to improve the management of the kingdom. These reforms included the creation of an independent Court of Finances, the standardization of weights and measures, and the establishment of a single currency.

Philip was the second son of King Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre. He was granted an appanage, the County of Poitiers, while his elder brother, Louis X, inherited the French and Navarrese thrones. When Louis died in 1316, he left a daughter and a pregnant wife, Clementia of Hungary. Philip the Tall successfully claimed the regency. Queen Clementia gave birth to a boy, who was proclaimed king as John I, but the infant king lived only for five days.

At the death of his nephew, Philip immediately had himself crowned at Reims. However, his legitimacy was challenged by the party of Louis X&#x27;s daughter Joan. Philip V successfully contested her claims for a number of reasons, including her youth, doubts regarding her paternity (her mother was involved in the Tour de Nesle Affair), and the Estates General&#x27;s determination that women should be excluded from the line of succession to the French throne. The succession of Philip, instead of Joan, set the precedent for the French royal succession that would be known as the Salic law.

Philip restored somewhat good relations with the County of Flanders, which had entered into open rebellion during his father&#x27;s rule, but simultaneously his relations with his brother-in-law Edward II of England worsened as Edward, who was also Duke of Guyenne, initially refused to pay him homage. A spontaneous popular crusade started in Normandy in 1320 aiming to liberate the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors. Instead the angry populace marched to the south attacking castles, royal officials, priests, lepers, and Jews.

In 1307 Philip married Joan II, Countess of Burgundy, with whom he had four daughters. The couple produced no male heirs, however, so when Philip died from dysentery in 1322, he was succeeded by his younger brother Charles IV.

==Personality and marriage==
Philip was born in Lyon in 1291, the second son of King Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre. His father granted to him the county of Poitiers in appanage. Modern historians have described Philip V as a man of &quot;considerable intelligence and sensitivity&quot;, and the &quot;wisest and politically most apt&quot; of Philip IV&#x27;s three sons. Philip was influenced by the troubles and unrest that his father had encountered during 1314, as well as by the difficulties his older brother, Louis X, known as &quot;the Quarreler&quot;, had faced during the intervening few years. At the heart of the problems for both Philip IV and Louis X were taxes and the difficulty in raising them outside of crises.

Philip married Joan of Burgundy, the eldest daughter of Otto IV, Count of Burgundy and Mahaut, Countess of Artois, on 21 January 1307. The original plan had been for Louis X to marry Joan, but this was altered after Louis was engaged to Margaret of Burgundy. Modern scholars have found little evidence as to whether the marriage was a happy one, but the pair had a considerable number of children in a short space of time, and Philip was exceptionally generous to Joan by the standards of the day. Philip went to great lengths not only to endow Joan with lands and money but to try to ensure that these gifts were irrevocable in the event of his early death. Amongst the various gifts were a palace, villages, additional money for jewels, and her servants and the property of all the Jews in Burgundy, which he gave to Joan in 1318.

Joan was implicated in Margaret&#x27;s adultery case during 1314; Margaret was accused and convicted of adultery with two knights, upon the testimony of their sister-in-law, Isabella. Joan was suspected of having secretly known about the adultery; placed under house arrest at Dourdan as punishment, it was then implied that Joan was guilty of adultery herself. With Philip&#x27;s support she continued to protest her innocence, and by 1315 her name had been cleared by the Paris Parlement, partially through Philip&#x27;s influence, and she was allowed to return to court. It is unclear why Philip stood by her in the way that he did. One theory has been that he was concerned that if he were to abandon Joan, he might also lose Burgundy; another theory suggests that his slightly &quot;formulaic&quot; love letters to his wife should be taken at face value, and that he was in fact very deeply in love.

==Accession and the Salic Law==
Philip&#x27;s older brother, Louis X, died on 5 June 1316 leaving the pregnant Clementia of Hungary as his widow. There were several potential candidates for the role of regent, including Charles of Valois and Duke Odo IV of Burgundy, but Philip successfully outmanoeuvred them, being appointed regent himself. Philip remained as regent for the remainder of the pregnancy and for a few days after the birth of his nephew John I, who lived for only five days.

What followed the death of John I was unprecedented in the history of the Capetian kings of France. For the first time, the king of France died without a son. The heir to the throne was now a subject of some dispute. Joan, the remaining daughter of Louis X by Margaret of Burgundy, was one obvious candidate, but suspicion still hung over her as a result of the scandal in 1314, including concerns over her actual parentage.

With only his niece between himself and the throne, Philip engaged in some rapid political negotiations and convinced Charles of Valois, who along with Odo IV was championing Joan&#x27;s rights, to switch sides and support him instead. In exchange for marrying Philip&#x27;s daughter, Odo IV abandoned his niece&#x27;s cause, not only her claim to the French throne but also her claim to Navarre&#x27;s. On 9 January 1317, with Charles&#x27;s support, Philip was hastily crowned at Rheims. The majority of the nobility, however, refused to attend. There were demonstrations in Champagne, Artois, and Burgundy, and Philip called a rapid assembly of the nobility on 2 February in Paris. Philip laid down the principle that Joan, as a woman, could not inherit the throne of France, played heavily upon the fact that he was now the anointed king, and consolidated what some authors have described as his effective &quot;usurpation&quot; of power. The exclusion of women, and later of their male descendants, was later popularized as the Salic law by the Valois monarchy. Joan, however, did accede in 1328 to the throne of Navarre, which did not hold to the Salic law.

The next year, Philip continued to strengthen his position. He married his eldest daughter Joan to the powerful Odo IV, bringing the Duke over to his own party. Philip then built his reign around the notion of reform – &quot;reclaiming rights, revenues and territories&quot; that had been wrongly lost to the crown in recent years.

==Domestic reform==
Domestically, Philip proved a &quot;strong and popular&quot; king, despite inheriting an uncertain situation and an ongoing sequence of poor harvests. He followed in the steps of his father, Philip IV, in trying to place the French crown on a solid fiscal footing and revoked many of the unpopular decisions of his predecessor and older brother, Louis X. He also instituted government reforms, reformed the currency and worked to standardise weights and measures. Amongst Philip&#x27;s key appointments was the later cardinal Pierre Bertrand, who would play a key role in successive French royal governments in subsequent years.

In 1317, Philip reissued an act first passed by his father, in 1311, condemning the alienation and theft of royal resources and offices in the provinces. By 1318, his political situation strengthened, Philip went further, setting out in a new act a distinction between the French royal domain – the core set of lands and titles that belonged permanently to the crown – and those lands and titles that had been forfeited to the crown for one reason or another. If the French crown was to bestow or grant new lands to nobles, Philip declared, they would usually be given only from the second source: this was a double-edged announcement, at once reinforcing the core, unalienable powers of the crown, whilst also reassuring nobles that their lands were sacrosanct unless they were forfeited to the crown in punishment for a crime or misdemeanour. Philip was responsible for the creation of the &quot;cours des comptes&quot; in 1320, a court responsible for auditing the royal accounts to ensure proper payment; the courts still exist today. In practice, Philip did not entirely keep to his self-declared principles on grants of royal lands and titles, but he was far more conservative in such matters than his immediate predecessors.

==Resolution of the Flanders conflict and England==
Philip was able to achieve a successful resolution of the ongoing Flanders problem. The Count of Flanders ruled an &quot;immensely wealthy state&quot;, which largely led an autonomous existence on the edge of the French state. The French king was generally regarded as having suzerainty over Flanders, but in recent years the relationship had become strained. Philip IV had been defeated at Courtrai in 1302 attempting to reassert French control, and despite the later French victory at the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle the relationship remained tense.

Robert III of Flanders had continued to resist France militarily, but by Philip&#x27;s accession to the throne had found himself increasingly isolated politically in Flanders itself. Meanwhile, the French position had become strained by the need to maintain a wartime footing. Louis X had prohibited exports of grain and other material to Flanders in 1315, resulting in a profitable smuggling industry that in turn discouraged legal trade with the French crown along the border region; Louis was forced to directly requisition food for his forces, resulting in a string of complaints from local lords and the Church. Philip began to reinstate a proper recompensation scheme in 1317, but the situation remained unstable.

Both Philip and Robert turned away from seeking a military solution in favour of a political compromise. Accordingly, Robert made an accommodation with Philip in June 1320, under which Robert would confirm his young grandson, Louis, as his designated heir, in return for Louis being pledged in marriage to Philip&#x27;s second daughter, Margaret. This would provide Robert, and then Louis, with strong French support within Flanders. Louis was, to a great extent, already under Philip&#x27;s influence. Louis had been brought up in Nevers in central France, and at Philip&#x27;s court. and was culturally effectively a French prince. This arrangement was a considerable success for Philip&#x27;s policy, although over time Louis&#x27; clear French loyalties and lack of political links within Flanders itself would lead to political upheaval and peasant revolt.

Philip also faced difficulties with Edward II of England. Like the Count of Flanders, Edward in his role as the ruler of Gascony owed homage to the king of France, but as a king in his own right, and as the head of a largely autonomous Gascon province, was disinclined to do so. Edward had not given homage to Louis X, and initially declined to do so to Philip, who had a reputation as being more favourable to the English than Louis X. In 1319 Philip allowed Edward to give homage by proxy, an honour by the standards of the day, but expected him to do so in person in 1320. Edward arrived in Amiens to do so, only to find that Philip was now insisting that Edward also give an oath of personal fealty to him – an act going beyond that of normal feudal homage. Edward gave homage but refused to swear fealty; nonetheless, this marked a period of increased French pressure on England over Gascony.

==Crusades==
Philip was also to play a role in the ongoing crusade movement during the period. Pope John XXII, the second of the Avignon popes, had been elected at a conclave assembled in Lyons during 1316 by Philip himself, and set out his renewed desire to see fresh crusades. Philip IV had agreed to a joint plan for a new French-led crusade at the Council of Vienne in 1312, with his son Philip, a &quot;committed crusader,&quot; taking the cross himself in 1313. Once king himself, Philip was obligated to carry out these plans and asked John for and received additional funds after 1316. Both Philip and John agreed, however, that a French crusade was impossible whilst the military situation in Flanders remained unstable. Nonetheless, John continued to assure the Armenians that Philip would shortly lead a crusade to relieve them. An attempt to send a naval vanguard from the south of France under Louis I of Clermont failed, however, with the forces being destroyed in a battle off Genoa in 1319. Over the winter of 1319–20 Philip convened a number of meetings with French military leaders in preparation for a potential second expedition, that in turn informed Bishop William Durand&#x27;s famous treatise on crusading. By the end of Philip&#x27;s reign, however, he and John had fallen out over the issue of new monies and commitments to how they were spent, and the attentions of both were focused on managing the challenge of the Shepherds&#x27; Crusade.

The Shepherds&#x27; Crusade, or the &quot;Pastoreaux&quot;, emerged from Normandy in 1320. One argument for the timing of this event has been that the repeated calls for popular crusades by Philip and his predecessors, combined with the absence of any actual large scale expeditions, ultimately boiled over into this popular, but uncontrolled, crusade. Philip&#x27;s intent for a new crusade had certainly become widely known by the spring of 1320, and the emerging peace in Flanders and the north of France had left a large number of displaced peasants and soldiers. The result was a large and violent anti-Semitic movement threatening local Jews, royal castles, the wealthier clergy, and Paris itself. The movement was ultimately condemned by Pope John, who doubted whether the movement had any real intent to carry out a crusade. Philip was forced to move against it, crushing the movement militarily and driving the remnants south across the Pyrenees into Aragon.

==Final year==
===&quot;Leper scare&quot;===
In 1321 an alleged conspiracy – the &quot;leper scare&quot; – was discovered in France. The accusation, apparently unfounded, was that lepers had been poisoning the wells of various towns, and that this activity had been orchestrated by the Jewish minority, secretly commissioned by foreign Muslims. The scare took hold in the febrile atmosphere left by the Shepherds&#x27; crusade of the previous year and the legacy of the poor harvests of the previous decade.

The French Jews were, by 1321, closely connected to the French crown; Philip had given orders that royal officials assist Jewish money lenders in recovering Christian debts, and some local officials were arguing that the crown was due to inherit the estates of dead Jewish merchants. Following the events of 1320, Philip was involved in fining those who had attacked Jews during the Shepherds&#x27; Crusade, which in practice added further to the dislike of this minority in France. Rumours and allegations about lepers themselves had been circulated in 1320 as well, and some had been arrested during the Crusade.

Philip was in Poitiers in June, involved in a tour of the south aimed at reform of the southern fiscal system, when word arrived of the scare. Philip issued an early edict demanding that any leper found guilty was to be burnt and their goods would be forfeit to the crown. The King&#x27;s southern tour and reform plans, although administratively sound by modern standards, had created much local opposition, and modern historians have linked the King&#x27;s role in Poitiers with the sudden outbreak of violence. This all put Philip in a difficult position: He could not openly side with those claiming wrongdoing by the lepers, Jews, and Muslims without encouraging further unnecessary violence; on the other hand, if he did not ally himself to the cause, he encouraged further unsanctioned violence, weakening his royal position. Some Jews did leave France as a result of the leper scare, but Philip had successfully resisted signing any formal edict, which limited the impact to some degree.

===Death and succession===
In August, Philip was continuing to progress his reform plans when he fell unwell from multiple illnesses. After a brief respite, he died at Longchamp, Paris. He was interred in Saint Denis Basilica, with his viscera buried at the church of the now-demolished Couvent des Jacobins in Paris.

By the principle of male succession that Philip had invoked in 1316, Philip was succeeded by his younger brother, Charles IV, since he left no sons. Charles was also to die without male issue, resulting ultimately in the claim to the French throne by Edward III of England and the subsequent Hundred Years War (1337–1453).

==Family==
In January 1307 Philip V married Joan II, Countess of Burgundy (daughter and heiress of Otto IV, count of Burgundy), and they had five children:
# Joan (1/2 May 1308 – 10/15 August 1349), Countess of Burgundy and Artois in her own right and wife of Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy
# Margaret (1309 – 9 May 1382), wife of Louis I of Flanders. Countess of Burgundy and Artois in her own right.
# Isabelle (1310 – April 1348), wife of Guigues VIII de La Tour du Pin, Dauphin de Viennois.
# Blanche (1313 – 26 April 1358), a nun.
# Philip (24 June 1316 – 24 February 1317).

==In fiction==
Philip is a character in &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;), a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon. In the novel, Philip was depicted as the most shrewd among the three sons of Philip IV. He was portrayed by Josep Maria Flotats in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by Éric Ruf in the 2005 adaptation.

<text>Charles IV (18/19 June 1294 – 1 February 1328), called the Fair (&quot;le Bel&quot;) in France and the Bald (&quot;el Calvo&quot;) in Navarre, was last king of the direct line of the House of Capet, King of France and King of Navarre (as Charles I) from 1322 to 1328. Charles was the third son of Philip IV; like his father, he was known as &quot;the fair&quot; or &quot;the handsome&quot;.

Beginning in 1323 Charles was confronted with a peasant revolt in Flanders, and in 1324 he made an unsuccessful bid to be elected Holy Roman Emperor. As Duke of Guyenne, King Edward II of England was a vassal of Charles, but he was reluctant to pay homage to another king. In retaliation, Charles conquered the Duchy of Guyenne in a conflict known as the War of Saint-Sardos (1324). In a peace agreement, Edward II accepted to swear allegiance to Charles and to pay a fine. In exchange, Guyenne was returned to Edward but with a much-reduced territory.

When Charles IV died without a male heir, the senior line of the House of Capet, descended from Philip IV, became extinct. He was succeeded in Navarre by his niece Joan II and in France by his paternal first cousin Philip of Valois. However, the dispute on the succession to the French throne between the Valois monarchs descended in male line from Charles&#x27;s grandfather Philip III of France, and the English monarchs descended from Charles&#x27;s sister Isabella, was a factor of the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

==Personality and marriage==
By virtue of the birthright of his mother, Joan I of Navarre, Charles claimed the title Charles I, King of Navarre. From 1314 to his accession to the throne, he held the title of Count of La Marche and was crowned King of France in 1322 at the cathedral in Reims. Unlike Philip IV and Philip V, Charles is reputed to have been a relatively conservative, &quot;strait-laced&quot; king – he was &quot;inclined to forms and stiff-necked in defence of his prerogatives&quot;, while disinclined either to manipulate them to his own ends or achieve wider reform.


Charles married his first wife, Blanche of Burgundy, the daughter of Otto IV, Count of Burgundy, in 1308, but Blanche was caught up in the &quot;Tour de Nesle&quot; scandals of 1314 and imprisoned. After Charles assumed the throne he refused to release Blanche, their marriage was annulled, and Blanche retreated to a nunnery. His second wife, Marie of Luxembourg, the daughter of Henry VII, the Holy Roman Emperor, died following a premature birth.

Charles married again in 1325, this time to Jeanne d&#x27;Évreux: she was his first cousin, and the marriage required approval from Pope John XXII. Jeanne was crowned queen in 1326, in one of the better recorded French coronation ceremonies. The ceremony represented a combination of a political statement, social event, and an &quot;expensive fashion statement&quot;; the cost of food, furs, velvets, and jewellery for the event was so expensive that negotiations over the cost were still ongoing in 1329. The coronation was also the first appearance of the latterly famous medieval cook, Guillaume Tirel, then only a junior servant.

During the first half of his reign Charles relied heavily on his uncle, Charles of Valois, for advice and to undertake key military tasks. Charles of Valois was a powerful magnate in his own right, a key advisor to Louis X, and he had made a bid for the regency in 1316, initially championing Louis X&#x27;s daughter Joan, before finally switching sides and backing Philip V. Charles of Valois would have been aware that if Charles died without male heirs, he and his male heirs would have a good claim to the crown.

==Domestic policy==
Charles came to power following a troublesome two years in the south of France, where local nobles had resisted his elder brother Philip V&#x27;s plans for fiscal reform, and where his brother had fallen fatally ill during his progress of the region. Charles undertook rapid steps to assert his own control, executing the Count of L&#x27;Isle-Jourdain, a troublesome southern noble, and making his own royal progress. Charles, a relatively well educated king, also founded a famous library at Fontainebleau.

During his six-year reign Charles&#x27;s administration became increasingly unpopular. He debased the coinage to his own benefit, sold offices, increased taxation, exacted burdensome duties, and confiscated estates from enemies or those he disliked. He was also closely involved in Jewish issues during the period. Charles&#x27;s father, Philip IV, had confiscated the estates of numerous Jews in 1306, and Charles took vigorous, but unpopular, steps to call in Christian debts to these accounts. Following the 1321 leper scare, in which numerous Jews had been fined for their alleged involvement in a conspiracy to poison wells across France through local lepers, Charles worked hard to execute these fines. Finally, Charles at least acquiesced, or at worst actively ordered, in the expulsion of many Jews from France following the leper scare.

==Foreign policy==
===Charles and England===
Charles inherited a long-running period of tension between England and France. Edward II, King of England, as Duke of Aquitaine, owed homage to the King of France, but he had successfully avoided paying homage under Charles&#x27;s older brother Louis X, and had only paid homage to Philip V under great pressure. Once Charles took up the throne, Edward attempted to avoid payment again. One of the elements in the disputes was the border province of Agenais, part of Gascony and in turn part of Aquitaine. Tensions rose in November 1323 after the construction of a bastide, a type of fortified town, in Saint-Sardos, part of the Agenais, by a French vassal. Gascon forces destroyed the bastide, and in turn Charles attacked the English-held Montpezat: the assault was unsuccessful, but in the subsequent War of Saint-Sardos Charles&#x27;s trusted uncle and advisor, Charles of Valois, successfully wrested control of Aquitaine from the English; by 1324, Charles had declared Edward&#x27;s lands forfeit and had occupied the whole of Aquitaine apart from the coastal areas.

Charles&#x27;s sister Isabella, wife of King Edward II, was sent to France in 1325 with the official mission of negotiating peace with her brother; unofficially, some chroniclers suggested that she was also evading Hugh Despenser the elder and Hugh the younger, her political enemies in England. Charles had sent a message through Pope John XXII to Edward suggesting that he was willing to reverse the forfeiture of the lands if Edward ceded the Agenais and paid homage for the rest of the lands. The Pope in turn had proposed Isabella as an ambassador. Charles met with Isabella and was said to have welcomed her to France. Isabella was joined by the young Prince Edward later that year, who paid homage to Charles on his father&#x27;s behalf as a peace gesture. Despite this, Charles refused to return the lands in Aquitaine to the English king, resulting in a provisional agreement under which Edward resumed administration of the remaining English territories in early 1326, whilst France continued to occupy the rest.

In 1326 after negotiations with Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, Charles renewed the Auld Alliance with Scotland through the Treaty of Corbeil (1326).

Meanwhile, Isabella had entered into a relationship with the exiled English nobleman Roger Mortimer and refused to return to England, instead travelling to Hainaut, where she betrothed Prince Edward to Philippa, the daughter of the local Count. She then used this money, plus an earlier loan from Charles, to raise a mercenary army and invade England, deposing her husband Edward II, who was then murdered in 1327. Under Isabella&#x27;s instruction, Edward III agreed to a peace treaty with Charles: Aquitaine would be returned to Edward, with Charles receiving 50,000 livres, the territories of Limousin, Quercy, the Agenais, and Périgord, and the Bazas county, leaving the young Edward with a much reduced territory.

===Revolt in Flanders===

Charles faced fresh problems in Flanders. Louis, the Count of Flanders, ruled an &quot;immensely wealthy state&quot; that had traditionally led an autonomous existence on the edge of the French state. The French king was generally regarded as having suzerainty over Flanders, but under former monarchs the relationship had become strained. Philip V had avoided a military solution to the Flanders problem, instead enabling the succession of Louis as count – Louis was, to a great extent, already under French influence, having been brought up at the French court. Over time, however, Louis&#x27; clear French loyalties and lack of political links within Flanders itself began to erode his position within the county itself. In 1323 a peasant revolt led by Nicolaas Zannekin broke out, threatening the position of Louis and finally imprisoning him in Bruges.

Charles was relatively unconcerned at first, since in many ways the revolt could help the French crown by weakening the position of the Count of Flanders over the long term. By 1325, however, the situation was becoming worse and Charles&#x27;s stance shifted. Not only did the uprising mean that Louis could not pay Charles some of the monies due to him under previous treaties, the scale of the rebellion represented a wider threat to the feudal order in France itself, and to some it might appear that Charles was actually unable, rather than unwilling, to intervene to protect his vassal. Accordingly, France intervened.

In November 1325 Charles declared the rebels guilty of high treason and ordered them excommunicated, mobilising an army at the same time. Louis pardoned the rebels and was then released, but once safely back in Paris he shifted his position and promised Charles not to agree to any separate peace treaty. Despite having amassed forces along the border, Charles&#x27;s military attentions were distracted by the problems in Gascony, and he eventually chose to settle the rebellion peacefully through the Peace of Arques in 1326, in which Louis was only indirectly involved.

===Charles and the Holy Roman Empire===
Charles was also responsible for shaping the life of his nephew, Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. The latter, originally named Wenceslaus, came to the French court in 1323, aged seven, where he was taken under the patronage of the French king. Charles gave his nephew a particularly advanced education by the standards of the day, arranged for his marriage to Blanche of Valois, and also renamed him.

===Charles and the Crusades===

The crusades remained a popular cause in France during Charles&#x27;s reign. His father, Philip IV, had committed France to a fresh crusade and his brother, Philip V, had brought plans for a fresh invasion close to execution in 1320. Their plans were cancelled, however, leading to the informal and chaotic Shepherds&#x27; Crusade.

Charles entrusted Charles of Valois to negotiate with Pope John XXII over a fresh crusade. Charles, a keen crusader who took the cross in 1323, had a history of diplomatic intrigue in the Levant – he had attempted to become the Byzantine emperor earlier in his career. The negotiations floundered, however, over the Pope&#x27;s concerns whether Charles IV would actually use any monies raised for a crusade for actual crusading, or whether they would be frittered away on the more general activities of the French crown. Charles of Valois&#x27;s negotiations were also overtaken by the conflict with England over Gascony.

After the death of Charles of Valois, Charles became increasingly interested in a French intervention in Byzantium, taking the cross in 1326. Andronicus II responded by sending an envoy to Paris in 1327, proposing peace and discussions on ecclesiastical union. A French envoy sent in return with Pope John&#x27;s blessing later in the year, however, found Byzantium beset with civil war, and negotiations floundered. The death of Charles the next year prevented any French intervention in Byzantium.

==Death and legacy==
Charles IV died in 1328 at the Château de Vincennes, Val-de-Marne, and is interred with his third wife, Jeanne d&#x27;Évreux, in Saint Denis Basilica, with his heart buried at the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris.

Like his brothers before him, Charles died without a surviving male heir, thus ending the direct line of the Capetian dynasty. Twelve years earlier, a rule against succession by women, arguably derived from the Salic Law, had been recognised – with some dissent – as controlling succession to the French throne. The application of this rule barred Charles&#x27;s one-year-old daughter Mary, by Jeanne d&#x27;Évreux, from succeeding as the monarch, but Jeanne was also pregnant at the time of Charles&#x27;s death. Since she might have given birth to a son, a regency was set up under the heir presumptive Philip of Valois, son of Charles of Valois and a member of the House of Valois, the next most senior branch of the Capetian dynasty.

After two months, Jeanne gave birth to another daughter, Blanche, and thus Philip became king and in May was consecrated and crowned Philip VI. Edward III of England claimed, however, that although the Salic law should forbid inheritance &quot;by&quot; a woman, it did not forbid inheritance &quot;through&quot; the matrilineal line . Thus Edward III, son of Queen Isabella, wife of Edward II and daughter of Philip IV, has the right to the French throne by inheritance. Pressing the claim to the French throne eventually caused the Hundred Years War (1337–1453).

==Family and succession==
Charles married three times and fathered seven legitimate children. In 1308, he married Blanche of Burgundy, daughter of Otto IV, Count of Burgundy. The marriage was dissolved in 1322. They had two children:
#Philip (January 1314March 1322)
#Joan (131517 May 1321).

In 1322, Charles married Marie of Luxembourg, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII. They had two children:
#Marie (born and died 1323).
#Louis (born and died March 1324).

On 5 July 1324, Charles married Joan of Évreux (1310–71), the daughter of Louis, Count of Évreux. Their three children were:
#Jeanne (May 1326January 1327)
#Marie (13276 October 1341)
#Blanche (1 April 13288 February 1393), married Philip, Duke of Orléans and Count of Valois, younger son of King Philip VI of France, they had no children.

All but one of Charles&#x27;s children died young. Only his youngest daughter, Blanche, survived to adulthood. Incidentally, Blanche was born two months after Charles died. During those two months, Charles&#x27;s cousin Philip served as regent pending the birth of the child. Once a female child was born, the regent succeeded to the throne as King Philip VI of France, becoming the first French king from the House of Valois.

==In fiction==
Charles is a character in &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;), a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon. He was portrayed by Gilles Béhat in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by in the 2005 adaptation.

<text>Salamis (; ; ) was an ancient Greek city-state on the east coast of Cyprus, at the mouth of the river Pedieos, 6 km north of modern Famagusta. According to tradition, the founder of Salamis was Teucer, son of Telamon, king of the Greek island of Salamis, who could not return home after the Trojan War because he had failed to avenge his brother Ajax.

==History==

===Early history===
The earliest archaeological finds go back to the eleventh century BC (Late Bronze Age III). The copper ores of Cyprus made the island an essential node in the earliest trade networks, and Cyprus was a source of the orientalizing cultural traits of mainland Greece at the end of the Greek Dark Ages, hypothesized by Walter Burkert in 1992. Children&#x27;s burials in Canaanite jars indicate a Phoenician presence. A harbour and a cemetery from this period have been excavated. The town is mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions as one of the kingdoms of &quot;Iadnana&quot; (Cyprus). In 877 BC, an Assyrian army reached the Mediterranean shores for the first time. In 708 BC, the city-kings of Cyprus paid homage to Sargon II of Assyria (Burkert). The first coins were minted in the 6th century BC, following Persian prototypes.

Cyprus was under the control of the Assyrians at this time but the city-states of the island enjoyed a relative independence as long as they paid their tribute to the Assyrian king. This allowed the kings of the various cities to accumulate wealth and power. Certain burial customs observed in the &quot;royal tombs&quot; of Salamis relate directly to Homeric rites, such as the sacrifice of horses in honor of the dead and the offering of jars of olive oil. Some scholars have interpreted this phenomenon as the result of influence of the Homeric Epics in Cyprus. Most of the grave goods come from the Levant or Egypt.

According to the foundation myth, the founder of Salamis is said to be Teucer, son of Telamon, who could not return home after the Trojan war because he had failed to avenge his brother Ajax. There is however some evidence that the area had been occupied long before the alleged arrival of Mycenaeans (at Enkomi) and the town of Salamis was developed as a replacement when Engkomi was isolated from the sea. There is otherwise little direct evidence to support the foundation myth.

===In the Greek period===
In the 11th century BC, the town was confined to a rather small area around the harbour but soon expanded westwards to occupy the area, which today is covered by forest. The cemetery of Salamis covers a large area from the western limits of the forest to the Monastery of St. Barnabas to the west, to the outskirts of the village of Ayios Serghios to the north, and to the outskirts of Enkomi village to the south. It contains tombs dating from the 9th century BC down to the Early Christian period. The earlier tombs are within the forest area, near the boundary of the early town.

Though Salamis maintained direct links with the Near East during the 8th and 7th centuries BC, there were bonds with the Aegean as well. One royal tomb contained a large amount of Greek Geometric pottery and this has been explained as the dowry of a Greek princess who married into the royal family of Salamis. Greek pottery was also found in tombs of ordinary citizens. At this time the Greeks were embarking on an eastward expansion by founding colonies in Asia Minor and Syria; Salamis must have served as an intermediate station; it has even been suggested that Cypriots helped the Greeks in their venture.

===Resistance to Persian rule===
In 450 BC, Salamis was the site of a simultaneous land and sea battle between Athens and the Persians. (This is not to be confused with the earlier Battle of Salamis in 480 BC between the Greeks and the Persians at Salamis in Attica.)

The history of Salamis during the early Archaic and Classical periods is reflected in the narrations of the Greek historian Herodotus and the much later speeches of the Greek orator Isocrates. Salamis was afterwards besieged and conquered by Artaxerxes III. Under King Evagoras I (411-374 BC) Greek culture and art flourished in the city. A monument, which illustrates the end of the Classical period in Salamis, is the tumulus, which covered the cenotaph of Nicocreon, one of the last kings of Salamis, who perished in 311 BC. On its monumental platform were found several clay heads, some of which are portraits, perhaps of members of the royal family who were honoured after their death on the pyre.

Marguerite Yon (archaeologist) claims that &quot;Literary texts and inscriptions suggest that by the Classical period, Kition [in present-day Larnaca]was one of the principal local powers, along with its neighbor Salamis.&quot;

===Alexander the Great and the Roman Empire===

After Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire, Ptolemy I of Egypt ruled the island of Cyprus. He forced Nicocreon, who had been the Ptolemaic governor of the island, to commit suicide in 311 BC, because he did not trust him any more. In his place came king Menelaus, who was the brother of the first Ptolemy. Nicocreon is supposed to be buried in one of the big tumuli near Enkomi. Salamis remained the seat of the governor.

In 306 BC, Salamis was the site of a naval battle between the fleets of Demetrius I of Macedon and Ptolemy I of Egypt. Demetrius won the battle and captured the island.

In 58 BC, the Roman Republic annexed Cyprus; the Senate commissioned Cato the Younger to add Cyprus to the Republic&#x27;s dominions. Ptolemy of Cyprus, the last Cypriotic king, committed suicide rather than surrender to Rome.

In Roman times, Salamis was part of the Roman province of Cilicia. The seat of the governor was relocated to Paphos. The town suffered heavily during the Jewish uprising of AD 116–117. Although Salamis ceased to be the capital of Cyprus from the Hellenistic period onwards when it was replaced by Paphos, its wealth and importance did not diminish. The city was particularly favoured by the Roman emperors Trajan and Hadrian, who restored and established its public buildings.

===In the Roman and Byzantine periods===

The &quot;cultural centre&quot; of Salamis during the Roman period was situated at the northernmost part of the city, where a gymnasium, theatre, amphitheatre, stadium and public baths have been revealed.
There are baths, public latrines (for 44 users), various little bits of mosaic, a harbour wall, a Hellenistic and Roman agora and a temple of Zeus that had the right to grant asylum. Byzantine remains include the basilica of Bishop Epiphanos (AD 367–403). It served as the metropolitan church of Salamis. St. Epiphanios is buried at the southern apse. The church contains a baptistry heated by hypocausts. The church was destroyed in the 7th century and replaced by a smaller building to the south.

There are very extensive ruins. The theatre, and the gymnasium have been extensively restored. Numerous statues are displayed in the central court of the gymnasium most of which are headless. While a statue of Augustus originally belonged here, some columns and statues originally adorned the theatre and were only brought here after an earthquake in the 4th century. The theatre is of Augustean date. It could house up to 15.000 spectators but was destroyed in the 4th century.

The town was supplied with water by an aquaeduct from Kythrea, destroyed in the 7th century. The water was collected in a large cistern near the Agora. The necropolis of Salamis covers ca. 7 km² to the west of the town. It contains a museum showing some of the finds. Burials date from the geometric to the Hellenistic period. The best known burials are the so-called Royal-Tombs, containing chariots and extremely rich grave gifts, including imports from Egypt and Syria. A tomb excavated in 1965 by the French Mission of the University of Lyon brought to light an extraordinary wealth of tomb-gifts, which also attest trade relations with the Near East.

===Christianity===
In what is known as the &quot;First Missionary Journey&quot;, Paul the Apostle and the Cypriot-born Barnabas made Salamis their first destination, landing there after heading out from Antioch of Syria. There they proclaimed Christ in the Jewish synagogues before proceeding through the rest of the island (Acts 13:1-5). Tradition says that Barnabas preached in Alexandria and Rome, and was stoned to death at Salamis in about 61 CE. He is considered the founder of the Church of Cyprus. His bones are believed to be located in the nearby monastery named after him.

Several earthquakes led to the destruction of Salamis at the beginning of the 4th century. The town was rebuilt under the name of Constantia by Constantius II (337–361) and became an Episcopal seat, the most famous occupant of which was Saint Epiphanius. Emperor Constantius II helped the Salaminians not only for the reconstruction of their city but also he helped them by relieving them from paying taxes for a short period and thus the new city, rebuilt on a smaller scale, was named Constantia. The silting of the harbour led to a gradual decline of the town. Salamis was finally abandoned during the Arab invasions of the 7th century after destructions by Muawiyah I ( reigned 661-680 ). The inhabitants moved to Arsinoë (Famagusta).

==Excavations==
Archaeological excavations at the site began in the late nineteenth century under the auspices of the Cyprus Exploration Fund. Many of these finds are now in the British Museum in London.

Excavations at Salamis started again in 1952 and were in progress until 1974. Before the Turkish invasion there was much archaeological activity there; one French Mission was excavating at Enkomi, another at Salamis and the Department of Antiquities was busy almost throughout the year with repairs and restorations of monuments and was engaged in excavations at Salamis. After the Turkish invasion the international embargo has prevented the continuation of the excavations. The site and the museums are maintained by the antiquities service. Important archaeological collections are kept in the St. Barnabas monastery. In the District Archaeological Museum there are marble statues from the gymnasium and the theatre of Salamis, Mycenaean pottery and jewellery from Enkomi and other objects representative of the rich archaeological heritage of the whole district. Several of the statues and sculptures from antiquity are disfigured, headless or mutilated, likely by Christian zealots in late antiquity during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.

The public buildings uncovered at the city site of Salamis date to the post-Classical period. The Temple of Zeus Salaminios, whose cult was established, according to tradition, by Teucer himself, must have existed since the foundation of the city; the extant remains date to the late Hellenistic period. Early excavators discovered in the esplanade of the Temple of Zeus an enormous marble capital carved on each side with a caryatid figure standing between the foreparts of winged bulls. Now in the British Museum&#x27;s collection, the function of the capital remains unclear, although it does indicate influence from Achaemenid art and is consequently dated to between 300 and 250 BC.

<doc id="78506" wikidata="Q674485" url="?curid=78506" title="Copper Canyon">
<text>Copper Canyon (Spanish: Barrancas del Cobre) is a group of six distinct canyons in the Sierra Madre Occidental in the southwestern part of the state of Chihuahua in northwestern Mexico that is in size. The canyons were formed by six rivers that drain the western side of the Sierra Tarahumara (a part of the Sierra Madre Occidental). All six rivers merge into the Rio Fuerte and empty into the Gulf of California. The walls of the canyon are a copper/green color, which is the origin of the name.

==History==
The New Spanish arrived in the Copper Canyon area in the 17th century and encountered the indigenous locals throughout Chihuahua. For the New Spanish, America was a new land to explore for gold and silver and also to spread Christianity. The New Spanish named the people they encountered &quot;Tarahumara&quot;, derived from the word Rarámuri, which is what the indigenous people call their men. Some scholars theorize that this word may mean &#x27;The running people&#x27;. During the 17th century, silver was discovered by the Hispanic in the land of the Tarahumara tribe. Some were enslaved for mining efforts. There were small uprisings by the Tarahumara, but with little to no avail. They eventually were forced off the more desirable lands and up into the canyon cliffs.
==Climate==

The alpine climate of the mountainous regions of Copper Canyon has moderate temperatures from October to November and March to April. The bottom of the canyons are humid and warm and remain that way throughout the year. During the warmest months, April through June, drought is a chronic problem with little rainfall until July when the rainy season begins.

==Flora and fauna==
The Sierra Tarahumara Occidental region contains numerous species of pine and oak trees.
Mexican Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga lindleyana&quot;) trees cover the high plateaus in altitudes over , but due to deforestation in the area, many species of wildlife are endangered. Cougars live in the remotest of regions and are rarely seen. After the summer rainy season these upper regions blossom with wildflowers until October.

From , oak trees grow in the huge forests as well as the more shade-tolerant types of trees. In the fall the forests become brilliant with color from Andean alder (&quot;Alnus acuminata&quot;) and poplar (&quot;Populus&quot; spp.) trees. Brushwood and scrubby trees grow on the canyon slopes, which can accommodate the dry season. Huge fig (&quot;Ficus&quot; spp.) and palm trees thrive at the bottom where water is plentiful and the climate is tropical.

==Threats to the ecosystem==
Due to increases in human population, there are many threats to the ecosystems of the Sierra Tarahumara Occidental region. The government funding to build a &quot;tourist friendly&quot; atmosphere poses threats to the environment and indigenous cultures. Roads have been built in the former isolated mountainous zones. Agriculture and grazing as well as the cutting of hardwoods and other trees for firewood has accelerated a soil erosion problem. Mesquite (&quot;Prosopis&quot; spp.) and desert ironwood (&quot;Olneya tesota&quot;) trees are cut and exported primarily to the U.S. for charcoal. Amapa (&quot;Tabebuia chrysantha&quot;) trees yield highly prized lumber for building and furniture making. Other trees are also cut and sold for their high-priced lumber. Over-harvesting of the forests in the area has caused the extinction of the imperial woodpecker and Mexican wolf. Approximately, two percent of the original old-growth forest remains. However, a massive forest-harvesting project in the region has been abandoned, for now, by the World Bank. The Mexican forestry department deemed these species of trees &quot;legally protected,&quot; but enforcement is difficult.

The government has taken measures to halt or slow down the cultivation of opium poppies and cannabis by spraying crops with herbicides, which threaten the populations of many different species. A large saturniid moth, &quot;Rothschildia cincta&quot;, is one of the species that are threatened by the spraying. Their cocoons are used by the native population for ceremonial purposes.

Open-pit mining for copper, gold and other metals not only produces air pollution from smelters, but has been linked to the serious decline of the Tarahumara frog (&quot;Rana tarahumarae&quot;). Every river system has been dammed causing fresh water shortages in nearby desert communities. An enormous dam is being constructed on the Rio Fuerte, which poses major environmental problems and may lead to massive losses of tropical forest and habitats.

Conservation is underway, but remains informal and slow. Mexico has environmental laws, but suffers from lack of financial resources. Enforcement has been lax or non-existent. Agencies are actively trying to increase the protection for natural preserves.

==Indigenous people==

Copper Canyon traditional inhabitants are the Tarahumara or Rarámuri. With no official census, the population of the Rarámuri people probably ranges between 35,000 and 70,000.
Many Rarámuri reside in the cooler, mountainous regions during the hot summer months and migrate deeper into the canyons in the cooler winter months, where the climate is more temperate. Their survival strategies have been to occupy areas that are too remote for city people, way off-the-beaten-path to remain isolated and independent so as to avoid losing their culture.

Tourism is a growing industry for Copper Canyon, but the acceptance of it is debated in the local communities. Some communities accept government funding for building roads, restaurants and lodging to make the area attractive for tourists. Many other groups of Rarámuri maintain their independence by living in areas that are as far away from city life as possible. Their way of life is protected by the mountainous landscape.

Their diet is largely domestic agrarian but does consist of meat from domesticated cows, chickens and goats, wild game and freshwater fish. Corn (maize) is the most important staple of the Rarámuri&#x27;s diet.

The Rarámuri people are known for their endurance running. Living in the canyons, they travel great vertical distances, which they often do by running nonstop for hours. A popular Rarámuri community race called rarajipari, is played by kicking a wooden ball along the paths of the steep canyons.

==Tourism==

There are many other ways to explore Copper Canyon such as hiking, biking, driving or horseback riding. The most popular way is by train, as the Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacífico or ChePe, runs along the main canyon called Canyon Urique, between Chihuahua and Los Mochis, on the Gulf of California.

The Chihuahua al Pacifico began in the late 19th century. The Mexican Revolution, lack of funding, and the overall difficulty of building a railroad over such terrain hindered its completion until 1961. The railroad comprises of rails with 39 bridges and 86 tunnels. The total trip takes approximately 15 hours and passes through towns, as well as the towering cliffs of the canyons. Along the railway, many Tarahumarans lay out their food, crafts and other wares for sale.

Mexico established the Parque Nacional Barranca del Cobre (Copper Canyon National Park) to showcase this remote area. The park is located in the municipalities of Batopilas, Bocoyna, Guachochi, and Urique.

The Basaseachic Falls National Park around the Basaseachic Falls is located within the canyon area.

==Cities and towns==

Among the villages located in or on the Copper Canyon are:
*Bahuichivo, ChePe train stop for Cerocahui, Urique, Piedras Verdes, Tubares
*Basaseachi, located near the Cascada Basaseachi waterfall in the Barranca Candameña. The towns and ranchos of San Lorenzo, Cahuisori, and Huahumar encircle the rim of the canyon, also home to Mexico&#x27;s highest waterfall Piedra Volada (). It is on the main Federal Highway 16 between Chihuahua, Chihuahua, and Hermosillo, Sonora. The Rio Candameña is a tributary of the Rio Mayo which flows into the Gulf of California.
*Batopilas, elevation , a town on the Batopilas River at the bottom of a canyon; first established by the Spanish around 1632 to mine silver. It is located southeast of Urique.
*Bocoyna, east of Creel, and on the eastern escarpment of the continental divide. The nearby Rio Conchos flows into the Rio Bravo (Rio Grande) on the Mexico-Texas border. Carichí, Sisoguichi, and Panalachi are important Tarahumara settlements on the Rio Conchos drainage system.
*Cerocahui, S. of the train stop at Bahuichivo.
*Creel, atop the canyon and, at altitude, marking one of the highest points on the ChePe railroad route (San Juanito is higher at ); a central point for commerce and tourism.
*Divisadero, a key train stop and vista point with views down into the Urique Canyon of the Barranca del Cobre. The ChePe train allows a 15-20 minute stop for visitors wishing to see the view. Divisadero and nearby Areponapuchi located south are major canyon-rim trailheads for hiking into the Rio Urique canyon. This high mesa is home to three tourist class hotels located on the canyon rim, as well as several guesthouses.
*Témoris, a dual town located apart in elevation. The ChePe train traverses the valley 3 times including a long tunnel to gain elevation. Located on the Rio Septentrion, lower Temoris is at .
*Urique, . Located at the bottom of the canyon rim below Bahuichivo, on the Urique River. It is NW of Batopilas, now connected by a rough road.

==In popular culture==
Copper Canyon was featured on Season 1 Episode 12, of &quot;Man vs. Wild&quot; on the Discovery Channel, on &quot;Raramuri Tale&quot;,

The nonfiction book &quot;Born to Run&quot; by Christopher McDougall, chronicling the story of ultra-runner Micah True in the Copper Canyon with the Tarahumara Indians, who taught him a better way to run. True was the race director of the Copper Canyon Ultra Marathon, which ends in Urique&#x27;s plaza. The race covers of single track trail and dirt road.

<doc id="78514" wikidata="Q752184" url="?curid=78514" title="Meliae">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Meliae (also called Meliads) (; or ) were usually considered to be the nymphs of the ash tree, whose name they shared.

==Mythology==
According to Hesiod, the Meliae (probably meaning all tree-nymphs) were born from the drops of blood that fell on Gaia [Earth] when Cronus castrated Uranus. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot;, the ash trees, perhaps meaning the Melian nymphs, are said to have been the progenitors of the generation of men belonging to Hesiod&#x27;s Bronze Age.

The Meliae were nurses of the infant Zeus in the Cretan Dikti mountains, according to the 3rd century BC poet Callimachus, &quot;Hymn to Zeus&quot;, where they fed him on the milk of the goat Amalthea and honey.

Callimachus appears to make the Theban nymph Melia, who was, by Apollo, the mother of Tenerus and Ismenus, one of the &quot;earth-born&quot; Meliae. Elsewhere, however, this Melia is an Oceanid, one of the many daughters of Oceanus and Tethys. The mythographer Apollodorus wrote that centaur Pholus&#x27;s parents were Silenus and one of the Meliae, thus differentiating him genealogically from the other centaurs.

<text>Fluorocarbons are chemical compounds with carbon-fluorine bonds. Compounds that contain many C-F bonds often have distinctive properties, e.g., enhanced stability, volatility, and hydrophobicity. Several fluorocarbons and their derivatives are commercial polymers, refrigerants, drugs, and anesthetics.

==Nomenclature==
Perfluorocarbons or PFCs, are organofluorine compounds with the formula CxFy, meaning they contain only carbon and fluorine. The terminology is not strictly followed and many fluorine-containing organic compounds are also called fluorocarbons. Compounds with the prefix perfluoro- are hydrocarbons, including those with heteroatoms, wherein all C-H bonds have been replaced by C-F bonds. Fluorocarbons includes perfluoroalkanes, fluoroalkenes, fluoroalkynes, and perfluoroaromatic compounds.

==Perfluoroalkanes==
===Chemical properties===
Perfluoroalkanes are very stable because of the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond, one of the strongest in organic chemistry.
Its strength is a result of the electronegativity of fluorine imparting partial ionic character through partial charges on the carbon and fluorine atoms, which shorten and strengthen the bond (compared to carbon-hydrogen bonds) through favorable covalent interactions. Additionally, multiple carbon–fluorine bonds increase the strength and stability of other nearby carbon–fluorine bonds on the same geminal carbon, as the carbon has a higher positive partial charge. Furthermore, multiple carbon–fluorine bonds also strengthen the &quot;skeletal&quot; carbon–carbon bonds from the inductive effect. Therefore, saturated fluorocarbons are more chemically and thermally stable than their corresponding hydrocarbon counterparts, and indeed any other organic compound. They are susceptible to attack by very strong reductants, e.g. Birch reduction and very specialized organometallic complexes.

Fluorocarbons are colorless and have high density, up to over twice that of water. They are not miscible with most organic solvents (e.g., ethanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, and chloroform), but are miscible with some hydrocarbons (e.g., hexane in some cases). They have very low solubility in water, and water has a very low solubility in them (on the order of 10 ppm). They have low refractive indices.

As the high electronegativity of fluorine reduces the polarizability of the atom, fluorocarbons are only weakly susceptible to the fleeting dipoles that form the basis of the London dispersion force. As a result, fluorocarbons have low intermolecular attractive forces and are lipophobic in addition to being hydrophobic and non-polar. Reflecting the weak intermolecular forces these compounds exhibit low viscosities when compared to liquids of similar boiling points, low surface tension and low heats of vaporization. The low attractive forces in fluorocarbon liquids make them compressible (low bulk modulus) and able to dissolve gas relatively well. Smaller fluorocarbons are extremely volatile. There are five perfluoroalkane gases: tetrafluoromethane (bp −128 °C), hexafluoroethane (bp −78.2 °C), octafluoropropane (bp −36.5 °C), perfluoro-n-butane (bp −2.2 °C) and perfluoro-iso-butane (bp −1 °C). Nearly all other fluoroalkanes are liquids; the most notable exception is perfluorocyclohexane, which sublimes at 51 °C. Fluorocarbons also have low surface energies and high dielectric strengths.

===Flammability===
In the 1960s there was a lot of interest in fluorocarbons as anesthetics. The research did not produce any anesthetics, but the research included tests on the issue of flammability, and showed that the tested fluorocarbons were not flammable in air in any proportion, though most of the tests were in pure oxygen or pure nitrous oxide (gases of importance in anesthesiology).

In 1993, 3M considered fluorocarbons as fire extinguishants to replace CFCs. This extinguishing effect has been attributed to their high heat capacity, which takes heat away from the fire. It has been suggested that an atmosphere containing a significant percentage of perfluorocarbons on a space station or similar would prevent fires altogether.

When combustion does occur, toxic fumes result, including carbonyl fluoride, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen fluoride.

===Gas dissolving properties===
Perfluorocarbons dissolve relatively high volumes of gases. The high solubility of gases is attributed to the weak intermolecular interactions in these fluorocarbon fluids.

The table shows values for the mole fraction, , of nitrogen dissolved, calculated from the Blood–gas partition coefficient, at 298.15 K (25 °C), 0.101325 MPa.

===Manufacture===
The development of the fluorocarbon industry coincided with World War II. Prior to that, fluorocarbons were prepared by reaction of fluorine with the hydrocarbon, i.e., direct fluorination. Because C-C bonds are readily cleaved by fluorine, direct fluorination mainly affords smaller perfluorocarbons, such as tetrafluoromethane, hexafluoroethane, and octafluoropropane.

====Fowler process====
A major breakthrough that allowed the large scale manufacture of fluorocarbons was the Fowler process. In this process, cobalt trifluoride is used as the source of fluorine. Illustrative is the synthesis of perfluorohexane:

The resulting cobalt difluoride is then regenerated, sometimes in a separate reactor:

Industrially, both steps are combined, for example in the manufacture of the Flutec range of fluorocarbons by F2 chemicals Ltd, using a vertical stirred bed reactor, with hydrocarbon introduced at the bottom, and fluorine introduced halfway up the reactor. The fluorocarbon vapor is recovered from the top.

====Electrochemical fluorination====
Electrochemical fluorination (ECF) (also known as the Simons&#x27; process) involves electrolysis of a substrate dissolved in hydrogen fluoride. As fluorine is itself manufactured by the electrolysis of hydrogen fluoride, ECF is a rather more direct route to fluorocarbons. The process proceeds at low voltage (5 – 6 V) so that free fluorine is not liberated. The choice of substrate is restricted as ideally it should be soluble in hydrogen fluoride. Ethers and tertiary amines are typically employed. To make perfluorohexane, trihexylamine is used, for example:

The perfluorinated amine will also be produced:

===Environmental and health concerns===
Fluoroalkanes are generally inert and non-toxic.

Fluoroalkanes are not ozone depleting, as they contain no chlorine or bromine atoms, and they are sometimes used as replacements for ozone-depleting chemicals.
The term fluorocarbon is used rather loosely to include any chemical containing fluorine and carbon, including chlorofluorocarbons, which are ozone depleting.

Perfluoroalkanes used in medical procedures are rapidly excreted from the body, primarily via expiration with the rate of excretion as a function of the vapour pressure; the half-life for octafluoropropane is less than 2 minutes, compared to about a week for perfluorodecalin.
Low-boiling perfluoroalkanes are potent greenhouse gases, in part due to their very long atmospheric lifetime, and their use is covered by the Kyoto Protocol. The global warming potential (compared to that of carbon dioxide) of many gases can be found in the IPCC 5th assessment report, with an extract below for a few perfluoroalkanes.
The aluminium smelting industry has been a major source of atmospheric perfluorocarbons (tetrafluoromethane and hexafluoroethane especially), produced as by-product of the electrolysis process. However, the industry has been actively involved in reducing emissions in recent years.

===Applications===
As they are inert, perfluoroalkanes have essentially no chemical uses, but their physical properties have led to their use in many diverse applications. These include:
*Perfluorocarbon tracer
*Liquid dielectric
*Chemical vapor deposition
*Organic Rankine cycle
*Fluorous biphasic catalysis
*Cosmetics
*Ski waxes
As well as several medical uses:
*Contrast-enhanced ultrasound
*Oxygen Therapeutics
*Blood substitute
*Liquid breathing
*Eye surgery 
*Tattoo removal 

==Fluoroalkenes and fluoroalkynes==
Unsaturated fluorocarbons are far more reactive than fluoroalkanes. Although difluoroacetylene is unstable (as is typical for related alkynes, see dichloroacetylene), hexafluoro-2-butyne and related fluorinated alkynes are well known.
===Polymerization===
Fluoroalkenes polymerize more exothermically than normal alkenes. Unsaturated fluorocarbons have a driving force towards sp3 hybridization due to the electronegative fluorine atoms seeking a greater share of bonding electrons with reduced s character in orbitals. The most famous member of this class is tetrafluoroethylene, which is used to manufacture polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), better known under the trade name Teflon.

===Environmental and health concerns===
Fluoroalkenes and fluorinated alkynes are reactive and many are toxic for example perfluoroisobutene. To produce polytetrafluoroethylene various fluorinated surfactants are used, in the process known as Emulsion polymerization, and the surfactant included in the polymer can bioaccumulate.

==Perfluoroaromatic compounds==
Perfluoroaromatic compounds contain only carbon and fluorine, like other fluorocarbons, but also contain an aromatic ring. The three most important examples are hexafluorobenzene, octafluorotoluene, and octafluoronaphthalene.
Perfluoroaromatic compounds can be manufactured via the Fowler process, like fluoroalkanes, but the conditions must be adjusted to prevent full fluorination. They can also be made by heating the corresponding perchloroaromatic compound with potassium fluoride at high temperature (typically 500 °C), during which the chlorine atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms. A third route is defluorination of the fluoroalkane; for example, octafluorotoluene can be made from perfluoromethylcyclohexane by heating to 500 °C with a nickel or iron catalyst.

Perfluoroaromatic compounds are relatively volatile for their molecular weight, with melting and boiling points similar to the corresponding aromatic compound, as the table below shows. They have high density and are non-flammable. For the most part, they are colorless liquids. Unlike the perfluoralkanes, they tend to be miscible with common solvents.

Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform and terrain history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and numerical modeling. Geomorphologists work within disciplines such as physical geography, geology, geodesy, engineering geology, archaeology, climatology, and geotechnical engineering. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.

== Overview ==
Earth&#x27;s surface is modified by a combination of surface processes that shape landscapes, and geologic processes that cause tectonic uplift and subsidence, and shape the coastal geography. Surface processes comprise the action of water, wind, ice, wildfire, and life on the surface of the Earth, along with chemical reactions that form soils and alter material properties, the stability and rate of change of topography under the force of gravity, and other factors, such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape. Many of these factors are strongly mediated by climate. Geologic processes include the uplift of mountain ranges, the growth of volcanoes, isostatic changes in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep sedimentary basins where the surface of the Earth drops and is filled with material eroded from other parts of the landscape. The Earth&#x27;s surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic, hydrologic, and biologic action with geologic processes, or alternatively stated, the intersection of the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere with its hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere.

The broad-scale topographies of the Earth illustrate this intersection of surface and subsurface action. Mountain belts are uplifted due to geologic processes. Denudation of these high uplifted regions produces sediment that is transported and deposited elsewhere within the landscape or off the coast. On progressively smaller scales, similar ideas apply, where individual landforms evolve in response to the balance of additive processes (uplift and deposition) and subtractive processes (subsidence and erosion). Often, these processes directly affect each other: ice sheets, water, and sediment are all loads that change topography through flexural isostasy. Topography can modify the local climate, for example through orographic precipitation, which in turn modifies the topography by changing the hydrologic regime in which it evolves. Many geomorphologists are particularly interested in the potential for feedbacks between climate and tectonics, mediated by geomorphic processes.

In addition to these broad-scale questions, geomorphologists address issues that are more specific or more local. Glacial geomorphologists investigate glacial deposits such as moraines, eskers, and proglacial lakes, as well as glacial erosional features, to build chronologies of both small glaciers and large ice sheets and understand their motions and effects upon the landscape. Fluvial geomorphologists focus on rivers, how they transport sediment, migrate across the landscape, cut into bedrock, respond to environmental and tectonic changes, and interact with humans. Soils geomorphologists investigate soil profiles and chemistry to learn about the history of a particular landscape and understand how climate, biota, and rock interact. Other geomorphologists study how hillslopes form and change. Still others investigate the relationships between ecology and geomorphology. Because geomorphology is defined to comprise everything related to the surface of the Earth and its modification, it is a broad field with many facets.

Geomorphologists use a wide range of techniques in their work. These may include fieldwork and field data collection, the interpretation of remotely sensed data, geochemical analyses, and the numerical modelling of the physics of landscapes. Geomorphologists may rely on geochronology, using dating methods to measure the rate of changes to the surface. Terrain measurement techniques are vital to quantitatively describe the form of the Earth&#x27;s surface, and include differential GPS, remotely sensed digital terrain models and laser scanning, to quantify, study, and to generate illustrations and maps.

Practical applications of geomorphology include hazard assessment (such as landslide prediction and mitigation), river control and stream restoration, and coastal protection. 

Planetary geomorphology studies landforms on other terrestrial planets such as Mars. Indications of effects of wind, fluvial, glacial, mass wasting, meteor impact, tectonics and volcanic processes are studied. This effort not only helps better understand the geologic and atmospheric history of those planets but also extends geomorphological study of the Earth. Planetary geomorphologists often use Earth analogues to aid in their study of surfaces of other planets.

== History ==
Other than some notable exceptions in antiquity, geomorphology is a relatively young science, growing along with interest in other aspects of the earth sciences in the mid-19th century. This section provides a very brief outline of some of the major figures and events in its development.

=== Ancient geomorphology ===
The study of landforms and the evolution of the Earth&#x27;s surface can be dated back to scholars of Classical Greece. In the 5th century BC, Greek historian Herodotus argued from observations of soils that the Nile delta was actively growing into the Mediterranean Sea, and estimated its age. In the 4th century BC, Greek philosopher Aristotle speculated that due to sediment transport into the sea, eventually those seas would fill while the land lowered. He claimed that this would mean that land and water would eventually swap places, whereupon the process would begin again in an endless cycle. The &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&quot; published in Arabic at Basra during the 10th century also discussed the cyclical changing positions of land and sea with rocks breaking down and being washed into the sea, their sediment eventually rising to form new continents. The medieval Persian Muslim scholar Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048), after observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers, hypothesized that the Indian Ocean once covered all of India. In his &quot;De Natura Fossilium&quot; of 1546, German metallurgist and mineralogist Georgius Agricola (1494–1555) wrote about erosion and natural weathering.

Another early theory of geomorphology was devised by Song dynasty Chinese scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095). This was based on his observation of marine fossil shells in a geological stratum of a mountain hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean. Noticing bivalve shells running in a horizontal span along the cut section of a cliffside, he theorized that the cliff was once the pre-historic location of a seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles over the centuries. He inferred that the land was reshaped and formed by soil erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt, after observing strange natural erosions of the Taihang Mountains and the Yandang Mountain near Wenzhou. Furthermore, he promoted the theory of gradual climate change over centuries of time once ancient petrified bamboos were found to be preserved underground in the dry, northern climate zone of &quot;Yanzhou&quot;, which is now modern day Yan&#x27;an, Shaanxi province. Previous Chinese authors also presented ideas about changing landforms. Scholar-official Du Yu (222–285) of the Western Jin dynasty predicted that two monumental stelae recording his achievements, one buried at the foot of a mountain and the other erected at the top, would eventually change their relative positions over time as would hills and valleys. Daoist alchemist Ge Hong (284–364) created a fictional dialogue where the immortal Magu explained that the territory of the East China Sea was once a land filled with mulberry trees.

=== Early modern geomorphology ===
The term geomorphology seems to have been first used by Laumann in an 1858 work written in German. Keith Tinkler has suggested that the word came into general use in English, German and French after John Wesley Powell and W. J. McGee used it during the International Geological Conference of 1891. John Edward Marr in his The Scientific Study of Scenery considered his book as, &#x27;an Introductory Treatise on Geomorphology, a subject which has sprung from the union of Geology and Geography&#x27;.

An early popular geomorphic model was the &quot;geographical cycle&quot; or &quot;cycle of erosion&quot; model of broad-scale landscape evolution developed by William Morris Davis between 1884 and 1899. It was an elaboration of the uniformitarianism theory that had first been proposed by James Hutton (1726–1797). With regard to valley forms, for example, uniformitarianism posited a sequence in which a river runs through a flat terrain, gradually carving an increasingly deep valley, until the side valleys eventually erode, flattening the terrain again, though at a lower elevation. It was thought that tectonic uplift could then start the cycle over. In the decades following Davis&#x27;s development of this idea, many of those studying geomorphology sought to fit their findings into this framework, known today as &quot;Davisian&quot;. Davis&#x27;s ideas are of historical importance, but have been largely superseded today, mainly due to their lack of predictive power and qualitative nature.

In the 1920s, Walther Penck developed an alternative model to Davis&#x27;s. Penck thought that landform evolution was better described as an alternation between ongoing processes of uplift and denudation, as opposed to Davis&#x27;s model of a single uplift followed by decay. He also emphasised that in many landscapes slope evolution occurs by backwearing of rocks, not by Davisian-style surface lowering, and his science tended to emphasise surface process over understanding in detail the surface history of a given locality. Penck was German, and during his lifetime his ideas were at times rejected vigorously by the English-speaking geomorphology community. His early death, Davis&#x27; dislike for his work, and his at-times-confusing writing style likely all contributed to this rejection.

Both Davis and Penck were trying to place the study of the evolution of the Earth&#x27;s surface on a more generalized, globally relevant footing than it had been previously. In the early 19th century, authors – especially in Europe – had tended to attribute the form of landscapes to local climate, and in particular to the specific effects of glaciation and periglacial processes. In contrast, both Davis and Penck were seeking to emphasize the importance of evolution of landscapes through time and the generality of the Earth&#x27;s surface processes across different landscapes under different conditions.

During the early 1900s, the study of regional-scale geomorphology was termed &quot;physiography&quot;. Physiography later was considered to be a contraction of &quot;&quot;physi&quot;cal&quot; and &quot;ge&quot;ography&quot;&quot;, and therefore synonymous with physical geography, and the concept became embroiled in controversy surrounding the appropriate concerns of that discipline. Some geomorphologists held to a geological basis for physiography and emphasized a concept of physiographic regions while a conflicting trend among geographers was to equate physiography with &quot;pure morphology&quot;, separated from its geological heritage. In the period following World War II, the emergence of process, climatic, and quantitative studies led to a preference by many earth scientists for the term &quot;geomorphology&quot; in order to suggest an analytical approach to landscapes rather than a descriptive one.

=== Climatic geomorphology ===

During the age of New Imperialism in the late 19th century European explorers and scientists traveled across the globe bringing descriptions of landscapes and landforms. As geographical knowledge increased over time these observations were systematized in a search for regional patterns. Climate emerged thus as prime factor for explaining landform distribution at a grand scale. The rise of climatic geomorphology was foreshadowed by the work of Wladimir Köppen, Vasily Dokuchaev and Andreas Schimper. William Morris Davis, the leading geomorphologist of his time, recognized the role of climate by complementing his &quot;normal&quot; temperate climate cycle of erosion with arid and glacial ones. Nevertheless, interest in climatic geomorphology was also a reaction &quot;against&quot; Davisian geomorphology that was by the mid-20th century considered both un-innovative and dubious. Early climatic geomorphology developed primarily in continental Europe while in the English-speaking world the tendency was not explicit until L.C. Peltier&#x27;s 1950 publication on a periglacial cycle of erosion.

Climatic geomorphology was criticized in a 1969 review article by process geomorphologist D.R. Stoddart. The criticism by Stoddart proved &quot;devastating&quot; sparking a decline in the popularity of climatic geomorphology in the late 20th century. Stoddart criticized climatic geomorphology for applying supposedly &quot;trivial&quot; methodologies in establishing landform differences between morphoclimatic zones, being linked to Davisian geomorphology and by allegedly neglecting the fact that physical laws governing processes are the same across the globe. In addition some conceptions of climatic geomorphology, like that which holds that chemical weathering is more rapid in tropical climates than in cold climates proved to not be straightforwardly true.

=== Quantitative and process geomorphology ===

Geomorphology was started to be put on a solid quantitative footing in the middle of the 20th century. Following the early work of Grove Karl Gilbert around the turn of the 20th century, a group of mainly American natural scientists, geologists and hydraulic engineers including William Walden Rubey, Ralph Alger Bagnold, Hans Albert Einstein, Frank Ahnert, John Hack, Luna Leopold, A. Shields, Thomas Maddock, Arthur Strahler, Stanley Schumm, and Ronald Shreve began to research the form of landscape elements such as rivers and hillslopes by taking systematic, direct, quantitative measurements of aspects of them and investigating the scaling of these measurements. These methods began to allow prediction of the past and future behavior of landscapes from present observations, and were later to develop into the modern trend of a highly quantitative approach to geomorphic problems. Many groundbreaking and widely cited early geomorphology studies appeared in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, and received only few citations prior to 2000 (they are examples of &quot;sleeping beauties&quot;) when a marked increase in quantitative geomorphology research occurred.

Quantitative geomorphology can involve fluid dynamics and solid mechanics, geomorphometry, laboratory studies, field measurements, theoretical work, and full landscape evolution modeling. These approaches are used to understand weathering and the formation of soils, sediment transport, landscape change, and the interactions between climate, tectonics, erosion, and deposition.

In Sweden Filip Hjulström&#x27;s doctoral thesis, &quot;The River Fyris&quot; (1935), contained one of the first quantitative studies of geomorphological processes ever published. His students followed in the same vein, making quantitative studies of mass transport (Anders Rapp), fluvial transport (Åke Sundborg), delta deposition (Valter Axelsson), and coastal processes (John O. Norrman). This developed into &quot;the Uppsala School of Physical Geography&quot;.

=== Contemporary geomorphology ===
Today, the field of geomorphology encompasses a very wide range of different approaches and interests. Modern researchers aim to draw out quantitative &quot;laws&quot; that govern Earth surface processes, but equally, recognize the uniqueness of each landscape and environment in which these processes operate. Particularly important realizations in contemporary geomorphology include:

:1) that not all landscapes can be considered as either &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;perturbed&quot;, where this perturbed state is a temporary displacement away from some ideal target form. Instead, dynamic changes of the landscape are now seen as an essential part of their nature.

:2) that many geomorphic systems are best understood in terms of the stochasticity of the processes occurring in them, that is, the probability distributions of event magnitudes and return times. This in turn has indicated the importance of chaotic determinism to landscapes, and that landscape properties are best considered statistically. The same processes in the same landscapes do not always lead to the same end results.

According to Karna Lidmar-Bergström, regional geography is since the 1990s no longer accepted by mainstream scholarship as a basis for geomorphological studies.

Albeit having its importance diminished, climatic geomorphology continues to exist as field of study producing relevant research. More recently concerns over global warming have led to a renewed interest in the field. 

Despite considerable criticism, the cycle of erosion model has remained part of the science of geomorphology. The model or theory has never been proved wrong, but neither has it been proven. The inherent difficulties of the model have instead made geomorphological research to advance along other lines. In contrast to its disputed status in geomorphology, the cycle of erosion model is a common approach used to establish denudation chronologies, and is thus an important concept in the science of historical geology. While acknowledging its shortcomings, modern geomorphologists Andrew Goudie and Karna Lidmar-Bergström have praised it for its elegance and pedagogical value respectively.

== Processes ==

Geomorphically relevant processes generally fall into
(1) the production of regolith by weathering and erosion,
(2) the transport of that material, and
(3) its eventual deposition. Primary surface processes responsible for most topographic features include wind, waves, chemical dissolution, mass wasting, groundwater movement, surface water flow, glacial action, tectonism, and volcanism. Other more exotic geomorphic processes might include periglacial (freeze-thaw) processes, salt-mediated action, changes to the seabed caused by marine currents, seepage of fluids through the seafloor or extraterrestrial impact.

=== Aeolian processes ===

Aeolian processes pertain to the activity of the winds and more specifically, to the winds&#x27; ability to shape the surface of the Earth. Winds may erode, transport, and deposit materials, and are effective agents in regions with sparse vegetation and a large supply of fine, unconsolidated sediments. Although water and mass flow tend to mobilize more material than wind in most environments, aeolian processes are important in arid environments such as deserts.

=== Biological processes ===

The interaction of living organisms with landforms, or biogeomorphologic processes, can be of many different forms, and is probably of profound importance for the terrestrial geomorphic system as a whole. Biology can influence very many geomorphic processes, ranging from biogeochemical processes controlling chemical weathering, to the influence of mechanical processes like burrowing and tree throw on soil development, to even controlling global erosion rates through modulation of climate through carbon dioxide balance. Terrestrial landscapes in which the role of biology in mediating surface processes can be definitively excluded are extremely rare, but may hold important information for understanding the geomorphology of other planets, such as Mars.

=== Fluvial processes ===

Rivers and streams are not only conduits of water, but also of sediment. The water, as it flows over the channel bed, is able to mobilize sediment and transport it downstream, either as bed load, suspended load or dissolved load. The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and on the river&#x27;s discharge. Rivers are also capable of eroding into rock and forming new sediment, both from their own beds and also by coupling to the surrounding hillslopes. In this way, rivers are thought of as setting the base level for large-scale landscape evolution in nonglacial environments. Rivers are key links in the connectivity of different landscape elements.

As rivers flow across the landscape, they generally increase in size, merging with other rivers. The network of rivers thus formed is a drainage system. These systems take on four general patterns: dendritic, radial, rectangular, and trellis. Dendritic happens to be the most common, occurring when the underlying stratum is stable (without faulting). Drainage systems have four primary components: drainage basin, alluvial valley, delta plain, and receiving basin. Some geomorphic examples of fluvial landforms are alluvial fans, oxbow lakes, and fluvial terraces.

=== Glacial processes ===

Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.

The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.

=== Hillslope processes ===
Soil, regolith, and rock move downslope under the force of gravity via creep, slides, flows, topples, and falls. Such mass wasting occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes, and has been observed on Earth, Mars, Venus, Titan and Iapetus.

Ongoing hillslope processes can change the topology of the hillslope surface, which in turn can change the rates of those processes. Hillslopes that steepen up to certain critical thresholds are capable of shedding extremely large volumes of material very quickly, making hillslope processes an extremely important element of landscapes in tectonically active areas.

On the Earth, biological processes such as burrowing or tree throw may play important roles in setting the rates of some hillslope processes.

=== Igneous processes ===
Both volcanic (eruptive) and plutonic (intrusive) igneous processes can have important impacts on geomorphology. The action of volcanoes tends to rejuvenize landscapes, covering the old land surface with lava and tephra, releasing pyroclastic material and forcing rivers through new paths. The cones built by eruptions also build substantial new topography, which can be acted upon by other surface processes. Plutonic rocks intruding then solidifying at depth can cause both uplift or subsidence of the surface, depending on whether the new material is denser or less dense than the rock it displaces.

=== Tectonic processes ===

Tectonic effects on geomorphology can range from scales of millions of years to minutes or less. The effects of tectonics on landscape are heavily dependent on the nature of the underlying bedrock fabric that more or less controls what kind of local morphology tectonics can shape. Earthquakes can, in terms of minutes, submerge large areas of land forming new wetlands. Isostatic rebound can account for significant changes over hundreds to thousands of years, and allows erosion of a mountain belt to promote further erosion as mass is removed from the chain and the belt uplifts. Long-term plate tectonic dynamics give rise to orogenic belts, large mountain chains with typical lifetimes of many tens of millions of years, which form focal points for high rates of fluvial and hillslope processes and thus long-term sediment production.

Features of deeper mantle dynamics such as plumes and delamination of the lower lithosphere have also been hypothesised to play important roles in the long term (&gt; million year), large scale (thousands of km) evolution of the Earth&#x27;s topography (see dynamic topography). Both can promote surface uplift through isostasy as hotter, less dense, mantle rocks displace cooler, denser, mantle rocks at depth in the Earth.

=== Marine processes ===
Marine processes are those associated with the action of waves, marine currents and seepage of fluids through the seafloor. Mass wasting and submarine landsliding are also important processes for some aspects of marine geomorphology. Because ocean basins are the ultimate sinks for a large fraction of terrestrial sediments, depositional processes and their related forms (e.g., sediment fans, deltas) are particularly important as elements of marine geomorphology.

== Overlap with other fields ==
There is a considerable overlap between geomorphology and other fields. Deposition of material is extremely important in sedimentology. Weathering is the chemical and physical disruption of earth materials in place on exposure to atmospheric or near surface agents, and is typically studied by soil scientists and environmental chemists, but is an essential component of geomorphology because it is what provides the material that can be moved in the first place. Civil and environmental engineers are concerned with erosion and sediment transport, especially related to canals, slope stability (and natural hazards), water quality, coastal environmental management, transport of contaminants, and stream restoration. Glaciers can cause extensive erosion and deposition in a short period of time, making them extremely important entities in the high latitudes and meaning that they set the conditions in the headwaters of mountain-born streams; glaciology therefore is important in geomorphology.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Aloadae () or Aloads (Ancient Greek: Ἀλωάδαι &quot;Aloadai&quot;) were Otus or Otos (Ὦτος means &quot;insatiate&quot;) and Ephialtes (Ἐφιάλτης &quot;nightmare&quot;), Thessalian sons of Princess Iphimedia, wife of Aloeus, by Poseidon, whom she induced to make her pregnant by going to the seashore and disporting herself in the surf or scooping seawater into her bosom. From Aloeus, sometimes their real father, they received their patronymic, the Aloadae. They had a sister Pancratis (Pancrato) who was renowned for her great beauty.

== Mythology ==
The Aloads were strong and aggressive giants, growing by nine fingers every month. Nine fathoms tall aged nine, they were only outshone in beauty by Orion.

=== War with the gods ===
The brothers wanted to storm Mount Olympus and gain Artemis for Otus and Hera for Ephialtes. Their plan - the construction of a pile of mountains atop which they would confront the gods - is described differently by different authors (including Homer, Virgil, and Ovid), and occasionally changed by translators. Mount Olympus is usually said to be the bottom mountain, with Mounts Ossa and Pelion upon Ossa as second and third, either respectively or vice versa. Homer says that the Aloadae were killed by Apollo before they had any beards, consistent with their being bound to columns in the Underworld by snakes, with the nymph of the Styx in the form of an owl over them.

According to another version of their struggle against the Olympians, alluded to so briefly that it must have been already familiar to the epic&#x27;s hearers, they managed to kidnap Ares and hold him in a bronze jar, a storage &quot;pithos&quot;, for thirteen months (a lunar year). &quot;And that would have been the end of Ares and his appetite for war, if the beautiful Eriboea, the young giants&#x27; stepmother, had not told Hermes what they had done&quot;, Dione related.Alerted by Eriboea, Hermes rescued Ares.

The brothers died on the island of Naxos, when Artemis changed herself into a doe and jumped between them. The Aloadae, not wanting her to get away, threw their spears and simultaneously killed each other. In another version, either Apollo killed the Aloadae in their attempt to scale the mountains to the heavens, or Otus tried to rape Artemis, and Apollo sent the deer in their midst, provoking their deaths.

Their two sisters, Elate and Platanus, mourned their deaths so much they were changed into trees, a fir and a plane tree respectively.

=== Other stories ===
According to Diodorus, the Aloadae are Thessalian heroes who were sent out by their father Aloeus to fetch back their mother Iphimedeia and their sister Pancratis, who had been carried off by Thracians. After having overtaken and defeated the Thracians in the island of Strongyle (Naxos), they settled there as rulers over the Thracians. But soon after, they killed each other in a dispute which had arisen between them, and the Naxians worshiped them as heroes.

In all these traditions, the Aloadae were represented as only remarkable for their gigantic physical strength; but there was another story which placed them in a different light. Pausanias related that they were believed to have been the first of all men who worshiped the Muses on Mount Helicon, and to have consecrated this mountain to them; but they worshiped only three Muses — Melete, Mneme and Aoede. They were bringers of civilization, founding the cities and teaching culture to humanity. They were venerated specifically in Naxos and Boeotian Ascra, two cities they founded. Besides these two, the foundation of the town of Aloïum in Thessaly was ascribed to them.

&quot;Ephialtes&quot; (lit. &quot;he who jumps upon&quot;) is also the Greek word for &quot;nightmare&quot;, and Ephialtes was sometimes considered the &quot;daimon&quot; of nightmares. In the &quot;Inferno&quot; of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; Ephialtes is one of six giants placed in the great pit that separates the eighth and ninth circles of Hell, Fraud and Cocytus, respectively. He is chained as punishment for challenging Jupiter.

==Paleontology==
&quot;Otozoum&quot;, the ichnogenus of sauropodomorph dinosaur, was named after Otus.

<text>Ephialtes (; ) was a Greek renegade during the Greco-Persian Wars. Born to Eurydemus () of Malis, he betrayed his homeland and people to the Achaemenid Empire by revealing the existence of a path around the Greek coalition&#x27;s position at Thermopylae. His efforts allowed the Persian army to overrun the Greeks&#x27; defensive formation and thereby win the Battle of Thermopylae in September 480 BCE. Ephialtes had hoped that he would be rewarded by the Persian king Xerxes I, but no such reward was bestowed upon him and he was instead forced to go into hiding when a bounty was placed on his head by the allied Greeks in their pursuit of punishing his act of treason. According to Herodotus, this bounty was collected by Athenades () of Trachis approximately a decade after the second Persian invasion of Greece was repelled; the Spartans paid Athenades in spite of the fact that his motivation for carrying out the killing apparently had nothing to do with Ephialtes&#x27; status as an outlaw.

==Role in the Greco-Persian Wars==

=== Betraying the Greeks to the Persian army ===
The allied Greek land forces, which Herodotus states numbered no more than 4,200 men, had chosen Thermopylae to block the advance of the much larger Persian army. Although this gap between the Trachinian Cliffs and the Malian Gulf was only &quot;wide enough for a single carriage&quot;, it could be bypassed by a trail that led over the mountains south of Thermopylae and joined the main road behind the Greek position. Herodotus notes that this trail was well known to the locals, who had used it in the past for raiding the neighboring Phocians.

The Persians used the trail to outflank the defenders. The Spartan king, Leonidas, sent away most of the Greeks, but he himself remained behind with a rear guard composed of 300 of his men, the Thespian contingent, comprising 700 Thespians, and a Theban detachment, composed of 400 men.

Ephialtes expected to be rewarded by the Persians, but this came to nothing when they were defeated at the Battle of Salamis. He then fled to Thessaly; the Amphictyons at Pylae had offered a reward for his death. According to Herodotus, he was killed for an apparently unrelated reason by Athenades () of Trachis, around 470 BC, but the Spartans rewarded Athenades all the same.

==== Accomplices ====
Herodotus notes that two other men were accused of betraying this trail to the Persians: Onetas, a native of Carystus and son of Phanagoras; and Corydallus, a native of Anticyra. Nevertheless, he argues Ephialtes was the one who revealed this trail because &quot;the deputies of the Greeks, the Pylagorae, who must have had the best means for ascertaining the truth, did not offer the reward on the heads of Onetas and Corydallus, but for that of Ephialtes.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In the 1962 film &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot;, Ephialtes was portrayed by Kieron Moore and is depicted as a shady farmhand who worked on a goat farm near Thermopylae. He betrays the Spartans because he was spurned by the Spartan maiden, Ellas, thinking he could win her over by dangling riches he thought he would later have. 

Frank Miller&#x27;s 1998 comic book miniseries &quot;300&quot;, the 2006 film adaptation of the same name, and the 2014 sequel, portray Ephialtes (played in the films by Andrew Tiernan) as a severely deformed Spartan exile whose parents fled Sparta to protect him from the infanticide he would have surely suffered as a disfigured infant.

<text>A local exchange trading system (also local employment and trading system or local energy transfer system; abbreviated LETS) is a locally initiated, democratically organised, not-for-profit community enterprise that provides a community information service and records transactions of members exchanging goods and services by using locally created currency. LETS allow people to negotiate the value of their own hours or services, and to keep wealth in the locality where it is created.

Similar trading systems around the world are also known as Community Exchange Systems, Mutual Credit trading systems, Clearing Circles, Trade Exchanges or [[Local exchange trading system|Time Banks]]. These all use &#x27;metric currencies&#x27; – currencies that &quot;measure&quot;, as opposed to the fiat currencies used in conventional value exchange. These are all a type of alternative or complementary currency.

In the 21st century, the internet-based networks have been used to link individual LETS systems, into national or global networks.

== History ==
Michael Linton may have originated the term &quot;local exchange trading system&quot; in 1983, for a time running the Comox Valley LETSystems in Courtenay, British Columbia. The system he designed was intended as an adjunct to the national currency, rather than a replacement for it. He called the currency &quot;green dollars&quot; and it was mostly used by a local dentist, but dwindled when he moved away. Linton started at least four more versions, with varying degrees of success, such as the &quot;Community Way Dollars&quot; in 2008. The system&#x27;s turnover in the first two years amounted to green $500,000. There were 5 LETS in Great Britain in 1992. In 1995 this number increased to 350 with 30,000 membership and 2 million turnover. In 2018 the University of Victoria undertook to research his archives as a demonstration of how people react to new ideas that are outside the norms of society. Linton thought that he had failed to communicate his idea adequately.
LETS is a new type of money which makes it easy to pursue new Livelihood without the previous wholesale transformation of Capitalism. It is thus regarded as an alternative currency movement, and as a form of political protest.
After flourishing in the 1990s, the LETS movement waned. Interest in local currency moved on to other designs such as time-based currency and dollar-backed local voucher schemes.

===Internet networks===
On the whole, the movement was slow to adapt to the internet and to the possibility of networking together. Reluctance to engage with technology, a belief in decentralisation/localisation and lack of funds all contributed to this.

Examples of LETS networks based on free software are the Cape Town-based Community Exchange System (CES), which links to the Geneva-based Community Forge and Spanish IntegralCES.

Internet Exchange Trading System was established in 1998 as an idea to spread local exchange tradings systems online and establish a service exchange online platform. It didn&#x27;t reach critical mass of users and the idea was later abandoned.

== Criteria ==

LETS networks facilitate exchange between members by providing a directory of offers and needs and by allowing a line of interest-free credit to each. Members&#x27; IOUs are logged in a centralised accounting system which publishes a directory as well as balances visible to all members. In case of a default, the loss of value or units is absorbed equally by all members, which makes it a mutual credit exchange. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network, or they may spend first and earn later.

In many countries, the distinction between LETS and timebanking is not clear, as many LETS use time as their unit of account.

As per Linton&#x27;s definition, LETS are generally considered to have the following five fundamental criteria:
* Cost of service: from the community for the community
* Consent: there is no compulsion to trade
* Disclosure: information about balances is available to all members
* Equivalence to the national currency
* No interest

According to a 1996 survey by LetsLink UK, only 13% of LETS networks actually practise equivalence, with most groups establishing alternative systems of valuation &quot;in order to divorce [themselves] entirely from the mainstream economy.&quot; Michael Linton has stated that such systems are &quot;personal money&quot; networks rather than LETS.

== Operation ==
A list of services offered by network members is put together to create a LETS scheme, and trading takes place between members using a local currency. The LETS foundation is a virtual currency, a check book, a directory as well as a transparent accounting system built on trust and community regulation.
The first LETS required nothing more than a telephone, an answering machine and a notebook. Since then, there have been several attempts to improve the process with software, printed notes, and other familiar aspects of traditional currencies.
# Local people set up an organization to trade between themselves, often paying a small membership fee to cover administration costs
# Members maintain a directory of offers and wants to help facilitate trades
# Upon trading, members may &#x27;pay&#x27; each other with printed notes, log the transaction in log books or online, or write cheques which are later cleared by the system accountant.
# Members whose balances exceed specified limits (positive or negative) are obliged to move their balance back towards zero by spending or earning.

LETS is a full-fledged monetary or exchange system, unlike direct barter. LETS members are able to earn credits from any member and spend them with anyone else on the scheme. Since the details are worked out by the users, there is much variation between schemes.

LETS is not a scheme for avoiding the payment of taxation, and generally groups encourage all members to personally undertake their liabilities to the state for all taxation, including income tax and goods and services tax. In a number of countries, various government taxation authorities have examined LETS along with other forms of counter trade, and made rulings concerning their use. Generally for personal arrangements, social arrangements, hobbies or pastimes, there are no taxation implications. This generally covers the vast majority of LETS transactions. Taxation liabilities accrue when a tradesperson or professional person provides his or her professional services in payment for LETS units, or a registered or incorporated business sells part of its product for LETS units. In such cases, the businesses are generally encouraged to sell the service or product partly for LETS units and partly in the national currency, to allow the payment of all required taxation. This does imply, however, that in situations where national-currency expenditures would be tax-deductible, LETS must be as well.

In a number of countries, LETS have been encouraged as a social security initiative. For example, in Australia, Peter Baldwin, a former Minister of Social Security in the Keating government, encouraged LETS as a way of letting welfare recipients borrow against their welfare entitlement for urgent personal needs or to establish themselves in business.

Since their commencement over 30 years ago, LETS have been highly innovative in adapting to the needs of their local communities in all kinds of ways. For example, in Australia, people have built houses using LETS in place of a bank mortgage, freeing the owner from onerous interest payments.

== Benefits ==
LETS can help revitalise and build community by allowing a wider cross-section of the community—individuals, small businesses, local services and voluntary groups—to save money and resources in cooperation with others and extend their purchasing power. Other benefits may include social contact, health care, tuition and training, support for local enterprise and new businesses. One goal of this approach is to stimulate the economies of economically depressed towns that have goods and services, but little official currency: the LETS scheme does not require outside sources of income as stimulus.
The environmental benefits of enhanced locals&#x27; self-reliance involve less-distance transport (as local goods are substituted for imports) and more evident environmental effects. Moreover, diverse local economies support sustainability by decreasing the need to use assets in an inefficient manner to satisfy external consumer demands. That also requires improving the local quality of life without having to make expenditures. LETS can allow for much greater self-direction and flexibility in employment patterns than the mainstream, conventional economy and, in particular, enable the skills of the unemployed to be valued and used.

== Limitations ==
Even though LETS are strongly oriented towards the formal market economy, they disengage from it by establishing small, cooperative exchange enclaves in which trust and intimacy relationships are cultivated. And it also means that there is a small range of services available. LETS members must be economically involved outside to meet their needs. LETS also does not effect a &#x27;return&#x27; to bartering or the abolition of property.
&quot;LETS currency only has value when it is circulation.&quot;
While LETS members could decide individually to change the way they value money and life and develop new codes and live by them to a large degree, they were restricted in their ability to sustain this utopia. LETS have limited resources, so when they need mainstream resources, they might be unable to transfer their codes through their network.

== Examples ==
Local exchange trading systems now exist in many countries. Currency exchange between countries is done automatically through the CES or a similar network.

=== Africa ===
In 2003, the original CES was founded as internet-based LETS in Cape Town, South Africa. By 2011 it had grown into a global network spanning 99 countries.

 the following African countries had active communities linked in to the CES network: Botswana 2; Cameroon 1; Ethiopia 1; Kenya 2; Lesotho 2; Liberia 1; Madagascar 1; Namibia 2; Nigeria 2; South Africa 62; Swaziland 1; Uganda 1; Zambia 2; Zimbabwe 2.

=== Asia ===
In Japan, the &quot;Fureai kippu&quot; (in Japanese ふれあい切符: Caring Relationship Tickets) is a Japanese sectoral currency created in 1995 by the Sawayaka Welfare Foundation so that people could earn credits helping seniors in their community.
=== Australia ===
The Government of Australia, in 1989, allocated AU$50,000 for the development of LETSystems, including the running of state conferences, the production of software, a LETSystems Training Pack, and assistance to Michael Linton to visit Western Australia. By 1995 there were 250 LETSystems in Australia, with Western Australia having 43 separate systems serving a population of 2.3 million (although actual participation is by only a tiny fraction of that population), making it then the region with the highest LETS coverage in the world.

From around 2007, many Australian LETS groups started trading online using the Community Exchange System. This system allows new members to sign up directly, list offers and wants, and enter trades without assistance from the administrator.

By 2011 Australia had become the most active country on the Community Exchange System, prompting Tim Jenkin and Annette Loudon to set up the Australian Community Exchange System. there were 31 communities using CES.

=== Europe ===

In the Czech Republic, there are multiple LETS. Rozleťse, operating in the region of city of Brno sharing the same Cyclos3 server with other smaller groups in the regions of Jeseník, Ostrava and Beskydy. The capital, Prague, uses Pralets.

In Germany, CES has 11 German communities on its network.

In Switzerland an adaption of LETS, the Talent, was established and quite successfully launched in 1992. This spread out in Europe and spawned many other Talent-Groups in other countries.

The United Kingdom has many LETS systems, many loosely affiliated to LETSLINK UK and some operating under the CES system, such as North London LETS. In the UK Skillsbox operates an online community system similar to LETS, letting users trade their skills and time for credits which can be spent within the online community.

The Flemish part of Belgium has many LETS groups. There is a non profit organization promoting LETS: Lets Vlaanderen vzw. They assist the local groups in starting up, they organize events, they share knowledge.

The Suska Kör (Suska Circle) is a CES in Hungary that is present in some of the major cities.

In the Netherlands, there are approximately 55 LETS communities in 2024. 

=== South and Central America, Caribbean ===
, there were many active communities in the region being hosted on the CES global server: Argentina had 11; Brazil 14; Bolivia 1; Chile 9; Colombia 13; Costa Rica 3; Curaçao 1; Dominican Republic 2; Ecuador 3; Guatemala 1; Nicaragua 1; Paraguay 1; Peru 3; Puerto Rico 2; Sint Maarten 1; Trinidad and Tobago 2; Turks and Caicos Islands 1; Uruguay 3; US Virgin Islands 1; Venezuela 3.

<text>Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands are terrestrial biomes defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature. The predominant vegetation in these biomes consists of grass and/or shrubs. The climate is temperate and ranges from semi-arid to semi-humid. The habitat type differs from tropical grasslands in the annual temperature regime and the types of species found here.

The habitat type is known as prairie in North America, pampas in South America, veld in Southern Africa and steppe in Asia. Generally speaking, these regions are devoid of trees, except for riparian or gallery forests associated with streams and rivers.

Steppes/shortgrass prairies are short grasslands that occur in semi-arid climates. Tallgrass prairies are tall grasslands in higher rainfall areas. Heaths and pastures are, respectively, low shrublands and grasslands where forest growth is hindered by human activity but not the climate.

Tall grasslands, including the tallgrass prairie of North America, the north-western parts of Eurasian steppe (Ukraine and south of Russia), and the Humid Pampas of Argentina, have moderate rainfall and rich soils which make them ideally suited to agriculture, and tall grassland ecoregions include some of the most productive grain-growing regions in the world. The expanses of grass in North America and Eurasia once sustained migrations of large vertebrates such as bison (&quot;Bos bison&quot;), saiga (&quot;Saiga tatarica&quot;), and Tibetan antelopes (&quot;Pantholops hodgsoni&quot;) and kiang (&quot;Equus hemionus&quot;). Such phenomena now occur only in isolated pockets, primarily in the Daurian Steppe and Tibetan Plateau.

Temperate savannahs, found in Southern South America, parts of West Asia, South Africa and southern Australia, and parts of the United States, are a mixed grassy woodland ecosystem defined by trees being reasonably widely spaced so that the canopy does not close, much like subtropical and tropical savannahs, albeit lacking a year-round warm climate. In many savannas, tree densities are higher and are more regularly spaced than in forests.

The states of the Eurasian steppes and the North American Great Plains have been largely extirpated through conversion to agriculture. Nonetheless, as many as 300 different plant species may grow on less than three acres of North American tallgrass prairie, which also may support more than 3 million individual insects per acre. The Patagonian Steppe and Grasslands are notable for distinctiveness at the generic and familial levels in various taxa.

<text>Aloeus (; Ancient Greek: Ἀλωεύς probably derived from ἀλοάω &quot;aloaō&quot; &quot;to thresh, to tread&quot; as well as &quot;to crush, to smash&quot;) can indicate one of the two characters in Greek mythology:

*Aloeus or Haloeus, a Thessalian prince as the son of Poseidon and princess Canace, daughter of King Aeolus and Enarete. He was the brother of Hopleus, Nireus, Epopeus and Triops. His first wife was his niece Iphimedeia, and later Eriboea, daughter of Eurymachus. In some accounts, Aloeus was the father of Salmoneus who founded Elis, the girls Elate and Platanus, the twin giants, Otus and Ephialtes, collectively known as the Aloadae and lastly, the maiden Pancratis. These giants made war on the gods and captured the god Ares in a bag. Aloeus&#x27;s wife Eriboea reported this to the gods, for which Aloeus had her flayed alive. In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the sons of Aloeus were found in the underworld and there Aeneas sees them being punished by Rhadamanthus. This scene from Virgil was a precursor to Dante&#x27;s depiction of Hell. Aloeus was credited to have founded the city of Alus in Aetolia.
*Aloeus, son of Helios and possibly Antiope or Perse, who received from his father the sovereignty over the district of Asopia (Sicyon). He was the father of Epopeus, his successor.

<doc id="78550" wikidata="Q1362409" url="?curid=78550" title="Canace">
<text>In Greek mythology, Canace (; ) was a Thessalian princess as daughter of King Aeolus of Aeolia and Enarete, daughter of Deimachus. She was sometimes referred to as Aeolis.

== Family ==
Canace was the sister of Athamas, Cretheus, Deioneus, Magnes, Perieres, Salmoneus, Sisyphus, Alcyone, Calyce, Peisidice, Perimede Arne and possibly Tanagra. As the lover of Poseidon, she was the mother of Aloeus, Epopeus, Hopleus, Nireus and Triopas.

== Mythology ==
In another, more famous version Canace was a lover not of Poseidon, but of her own brother Macareus. This tradition made them children of a different Aeolus, the lord of the winds (or the Tyrrhenian king), and his wife Amphithea. Canace fell in love with Macareus and committed incest with him, which resulted in her getting pregnant. Macareus promised to marry Canace but never did. When their child was born, Canace&#x27;s nurse tried to take the baby out of the palace in a basket, pretending to be carrying a sacrificial offering, but the baby cried out and revealed itself. Aeolus was outraged and compelled Canace to commit suicide as punishment, sending her a sword with which she was to stab herself. He also exposed the newborn child to its death. This story was told by Latin poet Ovid in the &quot;Heroides&quot;, a selection of eighteen story-poems that pretend to be letters from mythological women to their lovers and ex-lovers. The story is also briefly referred to by Hyginus and retold by Pseudo-Plutarch, in whose account Macareus kills himself over the matter as well. It was also the subject of Euripides&#x27;s lost play &quot;Aeolus&quot;, on which the extant versions appear to be based.

Canace&#x27;s story was also put to the stage in the verse tragedy &quot;Canace&quot; (1588), by Italian playwright Sperone Speroni, as well as being the subject of a tale in Gower&#x27;s &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;. She also gave her name to the heroine of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Squire&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

==In ancient art==

#According to Pliny the Elder (35.99), a certain Aristeides from Thebes painted Canace dying from love to her brother ( ). This image, not preserved, might be dated between 340 and 290 BCE.
#Macareus&#x27; and Canace&#x27;s story is found on a hydria from Lucania, now in the archeological museum of Bari. It is thought to illustrate some scenes from Euripides&#x27; lost tragedy &quot;Aeolus&quot;.
#There is also a fresco from Rome, making part of a series of women personnages (the others being Pasiphaë, Phaedra etc.). Canace is depicted with a sword in her hand. The series might be a copy of some Hellenistic painting.

<doc id="78551" wikidata="Q1432229" url="?curid=78551" title="Taut-line hitch">
<text>The taut-line hitch is an adjustable loop knot for use on lines under tension. It is useful when the length of a line will need to be periodically adjusted in order to maintain tension. It is made by tying a rolling hitch around the standing part after passing around an anchor object. Tension is maintained by sliding the hitch to adjust the size of the loop, thus changing the effective length of the standing part without retying the knot.

It is typically used for securing tent lines in outdoor activities involving camping, by arborists when climbing trees, for tying down aircraft, for creating adjustable moorings in tidal areas, and to secure loads on vehicles. A versatile knot, the taut-line hitch was even used by astronauts during STS-82, the second Space Shuttle mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope.

== Naming ==
The adjustable loop forms of the rolling hitch and Magnus hitch, in addition to being called either of those two names, have also come to be known variously as the taut-line hitch, tent-line hitch, rigger&#x27;s hitch, adjustable hitch, or midshipman&#x27;s hitch. These knots are generally shown as being based on one of three underlying hitches: two variants of the rolling hitch (ABOK #1734 and #1735) and the Magnus hitch (#1736).

These three closely related hitches have a long and muddled naming history that leads to ambiguity in the naming of their adjustable loop forms as well. The use of the Ashley reference numbers for these inconsistently named hitches can eliminate ambiguity when required. See the adjacent image for an illustration of these related knots.

An early use of the taut-line hitch name is found in Howard W. Riley&#x27;s 1912 &quot;Knots, Hitches, and Splices&quot;, although it is shown in the rolling hitch form and suggested for use as a stopper.

== Tying ==

=== #1855 ===
Ashley uses the name midshipman&#x27;s hitch for this variation. Based on rolling hitch #1735, this version is considered the most secure but may be more difficult to adjust after being heavily loaded.

# Pass the working end around the anchor object. Bring it back alongside of the standing part and make a half-hitch around the standing part.
# Continue by passing the working end over the working part, around the standing part again and back through the loop formed in the first step. &quot;Make sure this second wrap tucks in between the first wrap and the working part of the line on the inside of the loop.&quot; This detail gives this version its additional security.
# Complete with a half-hitch outside the loop, made in the same direction as the first two wraps, as for a clove hitch.
# Dress by snugging the hitch firmly around the standing part. Load slowly and adjust as necessary.

=== #1856 ===
Based on rolling hitch #1734, this version is the one most often seen named taut-line hitch, typically in non-nautical sources. It is the method currently taught by the Boy Scouts of America. The earliest Boy Scout Handbook to include the taut-line hitch was the 5th edition, published in 1948. However it illustrated #1855, the variant shown above.

# Pass the working end around the anchor object. Bring it back alongside of the standing part and make a half-hitch around the standing part.
# Continue with another wrap inside the loop, effectively making a round turn around the standing part.
# Complete with a half-hitch outside the loop, made in the same direction as the first two wraps, as for a clove hitch.
# Dress by snugging the hitch firmly around the standing part. Load slowly and adjust as necessary.

=== #1857 ===
Based on Magnus hitch #1736, this is exactly as above but with the final hitch in the opposite direction. It can be more tricky to snug-up, since both lines emerge from the same side of the hitch, but it has less tendency to twist under load.

# Pass the working end around the anchor object. Bring it back alongside of the standing part and make a half-hitch around the standing part.
# Continue with another wrap inside the loop, effectively making a round turn around the standing part.
# Complete with a half-hitch outside the loop made in the opposite direction than the first two wraps, as for a cow hitch.
# Dress by snugging the hitch firmly around the standing part. Load slowly and adjust as necessary.

This is the form most commonly used for aircraft tie-down. One taut-line hitch is tied 15–30 cm from the aircraft and adjusted for tension, then a second taut-line hitch is tied 5–20 cm further from the aircraft and finished with a half-hitch. Wind-induced lift tends to pull the knot tighter, gust-induced oscillations tend to damp-out, and once the half hitch is undone, pushing the lower working rope up easily releases both hitches even amid icing.

== Adjusting ==

Once snug and set, the hitch can be adjusted as needed. To tighten the line with respect to a load attached to the standing part, the user can grasp the standing part with one hand inside of the loop and pull toward the anchor object. The hitch may be grasped with the other hand and as slack develops within the loop, the hitch slid away from the anchor object, taking up the slack and enlarging the loop. To loosen, the hitch may be slid toward the anchor object, making the loop smaller and lengthening the standing part.

== Security ==
Although the three variations are similar, they do have distinct properties when put to use. Ashley and others suggest that #1855 is preferred as being more secure. Either #1856 or #1857 is also acceptable, especially if ease of adjustment is desired over security. Ashley states #1857 has less tendency to twist.

These hitches may not hold fast under all conditions, and with lines made from particularly stiff or slick modern fibers (e.g. polypropylene) these hitches can be difficult to make hold at all. Sometimes they can be made more secure by using additional initial wraps and finishing half-hitches.

== Friction hitches==
These as a family are called Friction Hitches of hold and release to slide hitches

The similar ABoK numbers are in ABoK&#x27;s unique &quot;Chapter 22: Hitches to Masts, Rigging and Cable (Lengthwise Pull) 1st paragraph reads: &quot;To withstand a lengthwise pull without slipping is about the most that can be asked of a hitch. Great care must be exercised in tying the following series of knots, and the impossible must not be expected.&quot; A Friction Hitch is on a rope column that you are grabbing with &quot;Lengthwise pull&quot; force wise in this chapter. Not at the best (right) angle to host mount the rest of the book speaks of and shows for working hitches and thus chapter title and preface states. And so, the Friction Hitches are contained in this chapter on the errant pull angle stated as &quot;Lengthwise Pull&quot;. Book shows a &#x27;linear&#x27; Half Hitch to precede a Timber Hitch (that shows should pull at right angle to spar) so can pull lengthwise in ABoK#&quot;1733. The timber hitch and half hitch Killick hitch perhaps best demonstrates the directional force effect as he shows it as the first knot in the chapter right after the previous discussion as context . After showing the Half-Hitch preceding as only conversion for the direction adds: &quot;The knot appears to be universal and invariable&quot;!

<text>In Greek mythology, Macar (; Ancient Greek: Μάκαρ &quot;Makar&quot;) or Macareus (; Μακαρεύς &quot;Makareus&quot; means &#x27;happy&#x27;) or Macareas (, &quot;Makareas&quot;), is the name of several individuals:

* Macareus, an Arcadian prince as one of the 50 sons of the impious King Lycaon either by the naiad Cyllene, Nonacris or by unknown woman. He was the eponym of the town of Macaria in Arcadia. Macareus and his siblings were the most nefarious and carefree of all people. To test them, Zeus visited them in the form of a peasant. These brothers mixed the entrails of a child into the god&#x27;s meal, whereupon the enraged king of the gods threw the meal over the table. Macareus was killed, along with his brothers and their father, by a lightning bolt of the god.
* Macareus, son of Aeolus and either Enarete or Amphithea.
*Macareus, a king of Locris and father to Euboea. He may be the same with Macareus, father of Megaclite who consorted with Zeus and became the mother of Thebe and Locrus.
*Macareus, a king of Lesbos and son of Crinacus.
* Macareus of Rhodes, one of the Heliadae, children of Rhodus and Helios.
*Macareus, one of the Lapiths at the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia; he killed the Centaur Erigdupus.
* Macareus, a companion to Odysseus on his voyages, from Nericus, who also encountered Aeneas. He was one of those who got transformed into pigs by Circe.

<text>In Greek mythology, Enarete (, Ancient Greek: &quot;virtuous&quot; literally &quot;in virtue&quot;, from &quot;en&quot; &quot;in&quot; and &quot;arete&quot; &quot;virtue&quot;), or Aenarete ( &quot;Ainarete&quot;), was a queen of Aeolia (i.e. Thessaly) and ancestor of the Aeolians.

== Biography ==
Enarete was the daughter of Deimachus and wife of King Aeolus of Thessaly, son of the Greek progenitor Hellen. By the latter, she became the mother of his children including Cretheus, Sisyphus, Athamas, Salmoneus, Deion, Magnes, Perieres, Canace, Alcyone, Peisidice, Calyce and Perimede.

Enarete may be similar to Eurydice who bore Salmoneus, Sisyphus and Cretheus to Aeolus.

<text>Alope () was in Greek mythology a mortal woman, the daughter of Cercyon, known for her great beauty.

== Mythology ==
Poseidon, in the guise of a kingfisher, seduced Alope, his granddaughter through Cercyon, and from the union she gave birth to Hippothoon. Alope left the infant in the open to die of exposure, but a passing mare suckled the child until it was found by shepherds, who fell into a dispute as to who was to have the beautiful royal attire of the boy. The case was brought before Cercyon, who, on recognizing by the dress whose child the boy was, ordered Alope to be imprisoned in order to be put to death, and her child to be exposed again. The latter was fed and found in the same manner as before, and the shepherds called him Hippothoon. The body of Alope was changed by Poseidon into a spring, which bore the same name.

The town of Alope, in ancient Thessaly, was believed to have derived its name from her, where, however, Philonides speaks of an Alope as a daughter of Actor. There was a monument of Alope on the road from Eleusis to Megara, on the spot where she was believed to have been killed by her father.

<text>Hippothoon (; Ancient Greek: Ἱπποθόων, -ωντος) or Hippothous is a figure in Greek mythology, often described as the King of Eleusis, succeeding to the throne after the death of Cercyon. He is the Attic hero and the eponym of the Athenian phyle called Hippothoontis (Ιπποθοωντίς).

== Family ==
Hippothoon was the son of Poseidon and Alope, Cercyon&#x27;s daughter.

== Mythology ==
Although Cercyon had Alope buried alive, Poseidon turned her into the spring, Alope, near Eleusis. Hippothoon was stated to be present in the missions of Triptolemus and was mentioned along with Eumolpus as an Eleusinian hero who was worshiped according to honorary decrees dating to the 4th century BC. He was also described as the host of Demeter, instead of Celeus, during her wandering in search of Persephone.

According to Pausanias, a heroon was dedicated to him for worship by hereditarily assigned priests.

<doc id="78566" wikidata="Q972926" url="?curid=78566" title="Horse latitudes">
<text>The horse latitudes are the latitudes about 30 degrees north and south of the Equator. They are characterized by sunny skies, calm winds, and very little precipitation. They are also known as subtropical ridges or highs. It is a high-pressure area at the divergence of trade winds and the westerlies.

==Etymology==

A likely and documented explanation is that the term is derived from the &quot;dead horse&quot; ritual of seamen (see Beating a dead horse). In this practice, the seaman paraded a straw-stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck before throwing it overboard. Seamen were paid partly in advance before a long voyage, and they frequently spent their pay all at once, resulting in a period of time without income. This period was called the &quot;dead horse&quot; time, and it usually lasted a month or two. The seaman&#x27;s ceremony was to celebrate having worked off the &quot;dead horse&quot; debt. As west-bound shipping from Europe usually reached the subtropics at about the time the &quot;dead horse&quot; was worked off, the latitude became associated with the ceremony.

An alternative theory, of sufficient popularity to serve as an example of folk etymology, is that the term &quot;horse latitudes&quot; originates from when the Spanish transported horses by ship to their colonies in the West Indies and Americas. Ships often became becalmed in mid-ocean in this latitude, thus severely prolonging the voyage; the resulting water shortages made it impossible for the crew to keep the horses alive, and they would throw the dead or dying animals overboard.

A third explanation, which simultaneously explains both the northern and southern horse latitudes and does not depend on the length of the voyage or the port of departure, is based on maritime terminology: a ship was said to be &#x27;horsed&#x27; when, although there was insufficient wind for sail, the vessel could make good progress by latching on to a strong current. This was suggested by Edward Taube in his article &quot;The Sense of &#x27;Horse&#x27; in the Horse Latitudes&quot;. He argued the maritime use of &#x27;horsed&#x27; described a ship that was being carried along by an ocean current or tide in the manner of a rider on horseback. The term had been in use since the end of the seventeenth century. Furthermore, &quot;The India Directory&quot; in its entry for Fernando de Noronha, an island off the coast of Brazil, mentions it had been visited frequently by ships &quot;occasioned by the currents having horsed them to the westward&quot;.

A further explanation is that this naming first appeared in the English translation of a German book where &quot;Rossbreiten&quot; was incorrectly understood as &quot;Pferdbreiten&quot;. The &#x27;Ross latitudes&#x27; were named after the Englishman who described them first but could have been mistranslated, as &quot;Pferd&quot; and &quot;Ross&quot; are German synonyms for a horse. An incorrect translation could therefore have produced the term &quot;horse latitudes&quot;.

==Formation==
The heating of the earth at the thermal equator leads to large amounts of convection along the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This air mass rises and then diverges, moving away from the equator in both northerly and southerly directions. As the air moves towards the mid-latitudes on both sides of the equator, it cools and sinks. This creates a ridge of high pressure near the 30th parallel in both hemispheres. At the surface level, the sinking air diverges again with some returning to the equator, creating the Hadley cell which during summer is reinforced by other climatological mechanisms such as the Rodwell–Hoskins mechanism. Many of the world&#x27;s deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure areas.

The subtropical ridge moves poleward during the summer, reaching its highest latitude in early autumn, before moving back during the cold season. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can displace the northern hemisphere subtropical ridge, with La Niña allowing for a more northerly axis for the ridge, while El Niños show flatter, more southerly ridges. The change of the ridge position during ENSO cycles changes the tracks of tropical cyclones that form around their equatorward and western peripheries. As the subtropical ridge varies in position and strength, it can enhance or depress monsoon regimes around their low-latitude periphery.

The horse latitudes are associated with the subtropical anticyclone. The belt in the Northern Hemisphere is sometimes called the &quot;calms of Cancer&quot; and that in the Southern Hemisphere the &quot;calms of Capricorn&quot;.

The consistently warm, dry, and sunny conditions of the horse latitudes are the main cause for the existence of the world&#x27;s major hot deserts, such as the Sahara Desert in Africa, the Arabian and Syrian deserts in the Middle East, the Mojave and Sonoran deserts in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, all in the Northern Hemisphere; and the Atacama Desert, the Namib Desert, the Kalahari Desert, and the Australian Desert in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Migration==
The subtropical ridge starts migrating poleward in late spring reaching its zenith in early autumn before retreating equatorward during the late fall, winter, and early spring. The equatorward migration of the subtropical ridge during the cold season is due to increasing north-south temperature differences between the poles and tropics. The latitudinal movement of the subtropical ridge is strongly correlated with the progression of the monsoon trough or Intertropical Convergence Zone.

Most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the Westerlies. When the subtropical ridge shifts due to ENSO, so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience far fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years, while mainland China experiences much greater landfall frequency during La Niña years. During El Niño years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago, while in La Niña years the formation of tropical cyclones, along with the subtropical ridge position, shift west, which increases the threat to China. In the Atlantic basin, the subtropical ridge position tends to lie about 5 degrees farther south during El Niño years, which leads to a more southerly recurvature for tropical cyclones during those years.

When the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation&#x27;s mode is favorable to tropical cyclone development (1995–present), it amplifies the subtropical ridge across the central and eastern Atlantic.

==Role in weather formation and air quality==


When the subtropical ridge in the northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia. The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. The subtropical ridge across North America typically migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September. When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When the high pressure moves south, its circulation cuts off the moisture, and the hot, dry continental airmass returns from the northwest, and therefore the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.

In summer, On the subtropical ridge&#x27;s western edge (generally on the eastern coast of continents), the high-pressure cell pushes poleward a southerly flow (northerly in the southern hemisphere) of tropical air. In the United States, the subtropical ridge Bermuda High helps create the hot, sultry summers with daily thunderstorms with buoyant airmasses typical of the Gulf of Mexico and the East Coast of the United States. This flow pattern also occurs on the eastern coasts of continents in other subtropical climates such as South China, southern Japan, central-eastern South America Pampas, southern Queensland and, KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa.

When surface winds become light, the subsidence produced directly under the subtropical ridge can lead to a buildup of particulates in urban areas under the ridge, leading to widespread haze. If the low-level relative humidity rises towards 100 percent overnight, fog can form.

<text>Marcel François Marie Joseph Lefebvre (29 November 1905 – 25 March 1991) was a French Catholic archbishop who greatly influenced modern traditionalist Catholicism. In 1970, five years after the close of the Second Vatican Council, he founded the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), a community to train seminarians in the traditional manner, in the village of Écône, Switzerland. In 1988, Pope John Paul II declared that Archbishop Lefebvre had &quot;incurred the grave penalty of excommunication envisaged by ecclesiastical law&quot; for consecrating four bishops against the pope&#x27;s express prohibition but, according to Lefebvre, in reliance on an &quot;agreement given by the Holy See ... for the consecration of one bishop.&quot;

Ordained a diocesan priest in 1929, he had joined the Holy Ghost Fathers for missionary work and was assigned to teach at a seminary in Gabon in 1932. In 1947, he was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Dakar, Senegal, and the next year as the Apostolic Delegate for West Africa. Upon his return to Europe he was elected Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers and assigned to participate in the drafting and preparation of documents for the upcoming Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) announced by Pope John XXIII. He was a major leader of the conservative bloc during its proceedings. He later took the lead in opposing certain changes within the church associated with the council. He refused to implement council-inspired reforms demanded by the Holy Ghost Fathers and resigned from its leadership in 1968. In 1970, he founded the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX) as a small community of seminarians in the village of Écône, Switzerland, with the permission of the local bishop.

In 1975, after a flare of tensions with the Holy See, Lefebvre was ordered to disband the society, but ignored the decision and continued to maintain its activities and existence. In 1988, against the express prohibition of Pope John Paul II, he consecrated four bishops to continue his work with the SSPX. The Holy See immediately declared that he and the other bishops who had participated in the ceremony had incurred automatic excommunication under Catholic canon law, which Lefebvre refused to acknowledge.

== Early life and family ==
Marcel Lefebvre was born in Tourcoing, Nord. He was the second son and third child of eight children of textile factory-owner René Lefebvre and Gabrielle, born Watine, who died in 1938.

His parents were devout Catholics who brought their children to daily Mass. His father, René, was an outspoken monarchist, devoting his life to the cause of the French Dynasty, seeing in a monarchy the only way of restoring to his country its past grandeur and a Christian revival.

His father ran a spy-ring for British Intelligence when Tourcoing was occupied by the Germans during World War I. René died at Sonnenburg aged 65 in 1944, having been sentenced to death one year before.

== Priest ==

In 1923 Lefebvre began studies for the priesthood; at the insistence of his father he followed his brother to the French Seminary in Rome, as his father suspected the diocesan seminaries of liberal leanings. He later credited his conservative views to the rector, a Breton priest named Father Henri Le Floch. He interrupted his studies in 1926 and 1927 to perform his military service. On 25 May 1929 he was ordained deacon by Cardinal Basilio Pompili in the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome. On 21 September 1929 he was ordained a priest of Diocese of Lille by its bishop, Achille Liénart. After ordination, he continued his studies in Rome, completing a doctorate in theology in July 1930.

Lefebvre asked to be allowed to perform missionary work as a member of the Holy Ghost Fathers, but in August 1930 Liénart required him to first work as assistant curate in a parish in Lomme, a suburb of Lille. Liénart released him from the diocese in July 1931 and Lefebvre entered the novitiate of the Holy Ghost Fathers at Orly in September. On 8 September 1932, he took simple vows for a period of three years.

Lefebvre&#x27;s first assignment as a Holy Ghost Father was as a professor at St. John&#x27;s Seminary in Libreville, Gabon. In 1934 he was made rector of the seminary. On 28 September 1935 he made his perpetual vows. He served as superior of a number of missions of the Holy Ghost Fathers in Gabon. In October 1945 Lefebvre returned to France to become rector of the Holy Ghost Fathers seminary in Mortain.

== Bishop in Africa ==
On 12 June 1947, Pope Pius XII appointed him Vicar Apostolic of Dakar in Senegal and titular bishop of Anthedon. On 18 September 1947 he was consecrated a bishop in his family&#x27;s parish church in Tourcoing by Liénart, now a cardinal, with Bishops Jean-Baptiste Fauret and Alfred-Jean-Félix Ancel as co-consecrators. In his new position Lefebvre was responsible for an area with a population of three and a half million people, of whom only 50,000 were Catholics.

On 22 September 1948, Lefebvre, while continuing as Vicar Apostolic of Dakar, received the additional responsibilities of Apostolic Delegate to French Africa, with his title changed to titular archbishop of Arcadiopolis in Europa. He became responsible for representing the interests of the Holy See to Church authorities in 46 dioceses in &quot;continental and insular Africa subject to the French Government, with the addition of the Diocese of Reunion, the whole of the island of Madagascar and the other neighbouring islands under French rule, but excluding the dioceses of North Africa, namely those of Carthage, Constantine, Algiers and Oran.&quot;

In the late 1940s, Lefebvre established a ministry in Paris to care for Catholic students from the French colonies in Africa. He and other missionaries in Africa thought young Africans would otherwise be attracted to radical ideologies, including anti-colonialism and atheism. This idea of &quot;safeguarding the Catholicism of the emerging African elite&quot; was later adopted by Pope Pius in his encyclical on the missions, &quot;Fidei donum&quot; (1957).

Lefebvre&#x27;s chief duty was the building up of the ecclesiastical structure in French Africa. Pope Pius XII wanted to move quickly towards an ecclesiastical structure with dioceses instead of vicariates and apostolic prefectures. Lefebvre was responsible for selecting these new bishops, increasing the number of priests and religious sisters, as well as the number of churches in the various dioceses. On 14 September 1955, Pope Pius decreed a complete reorganization of the ecclesiastical jurisdictions in French Africa. The Apostolic Vicariate of Dakar was made an archdiocese and Lefebvre became its first archbishop.

==Transition years, 1959–1962 ==
Lefebvre&#x27;s career shifted rapidly with the death of Pope Pius XII, moving from the missions to Rome, though not directly, and with indications he was at times favored and at times disfavored by the new pope. Pope John XXIII replaced Lefebvre as Apostolic Delegate to Dakar on 9 July 1959, a position that would quickly evolve as the colonies gained their independence in the 1960s. The next year, Pope John appointed Lefebvre to the 120-member Central Preparatory Commission for the Second Vatican Council.

After Senegal declared its independence in June 1960, its first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor proposed the country adopt its own form of socialism, which he as a Catholic believed compatible with Church doctrine. Lefebvre, still Archbishop of Dakar, criticized Senghor&#x27;s views in a March 1961 pastoral letter and then in a personal audience with Senghor, drawing on Pope Pius XI&#x27;s denunciation of socialism in his 1931 encyclical &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot;. Now at odds with the government, Lefebvre watched as the Holy See replaced European missionary bishops with Africans and tried to delay his own removal by asking for the appointment of a coadjutor, which met with no response. He told Pope John &quot;the Africans are not yet ripe&quot; and did not want to be responsible. Pope John said he took the responsibility and would see Lefebvre was taken care of properly.

On 23 January 1962, Lefebvre was transferred to the Diocese of Tulle, one of the smallest in France, while retaining the personal title of archbishop.
On 4 April 1962, he was named a consultor to the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith.

On 26 July 1962, the Chapter General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, dominated by those in leadership positions with fewer representatives of local communities, elected Lefebvre to a 12-year term as their Superior General. He won 53 of the 75 votes cast on the first ballot, though some delegates had &quot;strong misgivings&quot;. This meeting also moved the order&#x27;s headquarters from Paris to Rome. Upon being elected Superior General, Lefebvre resigned as bishop of Tulle; Pope John accepted his resignation on 7 August and named him titular archbishop of Synnada in Phrygia.

== Second Vatican Council ==
As a member of the Central Preparatory Commission Lefebvre participated in drafting documents for consideration by the Council Fathers, meeting in seven sessions between June 1961 and June 1962. Within the first two weeks of the first session of the council (October to December 1962) the Council Fathers rejected all the drafts.

Lefebvre and some like-minded bishops became concerned about the direction of the council&#x27;s deliberations and, led by Archbishop Geraldo de Proença Sigaud of Diamantina, formed a bloc that became known as the Coetus Internationalis Patrum (CIP) or International Group of Fathers, with the aim of guaranteeing their views were part of every council discussion.

The CIP was especially concerned about the principle of religious liberty. During the council&#x27;s third session (September to November 1964), Archbishop Pericle Felici, the secretary of the council and a prominent Curial conservative, announced that Lefebvre, with two other like-minded bishops, was appointed to a special four-member commission charged with rewriting the draft document on the topic, but it was soon discovered that this measure did not have papal approval, and major responsibility for preparing the draft document was given to the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity.

The CIP managed to get the preliminary vote (with suggestions for modifications) on the document postponed until the fourth session of the council, where, on 7 December 1965, an overwhelming majority approved the final text of the declaration &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot;. Lefebvre was one of the 70, about 3%, who voted against the declaration, but he added his signature to the document after that of the pope, though some withheld their signatures.

=== The Council and the Holy Ghost Fathers ===
At one point during the Council, some 40 bishops who were members of the Holy Ghost Fathers met with him to express their disagreement with his views and the role he was playing at the Council. He heard their views but did not engage in dialogue. His closing statement, &quot;We all have a conscience: everyone must follow his own.&quot;, left them dissatisfied. One said: &quot;He seemed to have a blockage. He seemed incapable of reviewing his ways of thinking.&quot;

Lefebvre felt the Council&#x27;s impact directly when the Holy Ghost Fathers held an Extraordinary General Chapter to respond to it. The order&#x27;s leadership, though their terms had years remaining, tendered their resignations effective with the close of the meeting as was traditional. The membership had insisted on a larger role for elected delegates, and they constituted half of the body. Lefebvre&#x27;s opponents were well organized, and when he tried to assume the chair, they insisted that the Chapter was a legislative body entitled to elect its own officers. On 11 September 1968 the Chapter supported that position on a vote of 63 to 40, and Lefebvre stopped attending. The Chapter then elected its leaders and proceeded with intense but respectful debate on the critical issue: the balance between the constraints of the order&#x27;s religious life and the exercise of its missionary charge. Lefebvre returned on 28 September and addressed the issue in uncompromising language. He predicted any changes would lead to &quot;a caricature of community life where anarchy, disorder, and individual initiative have free rein&quot;. His tone and arguments won him no support; the convention elected Fr. Joseph Lécuyer, a French theologian, his successor as superior general on 26 October.

== Theological and political positions ==
=== Background ===
Lefebvre belonged to an identifiable strand of right-wing political and religious opinion in French society that originated among the defeated royalists after the 1789 French Revolution. Lefebvre&#x27;s political and theological outlook mirrored that of a significant number of conservative members of French society under the French Third Republic (1870–1940). The Third Republic was reft by conflicts between the secular Left and the Catholic Right, with many individuals on both sides espousing distinctly radical positions (see, for example, the article on the famous Dreyfus affair). Thus it has been said that &quot;Lefebvre was... a man formed by the bitter hatreds that defined the battle lines in French society and culture from the French Revolution to the Vichy regime&quot;.

Lefebvre&#x27;s first biographer, the English traditionalist writer Michael Davies, wrote in the first volume of his &quot;Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre&quot;:
In similar vein, the pro-SSPX English priest Michael Crowdy wrote, in his preface to his translation of Lefebvre&#x27;s &quot;Open Letter to Confused Catholics&quot;:
=== Theological positions ===
Lefebvre was associated with the following positions:
* The rejection of &#x27;false&#x27; or &#x27;aberrant&#x27; ecumenism in favour of Catholic exclusivism;
* The espousal of pragmatic religious tolerance instead of the principle of religious liberty;
* The rejection of collegiality within the church in favour of strict papal supremacy;
* Opposition to the replacement of the Tridentine Mass with the Mass of Paul VI.

=== Political positions ===
Political positions espoused by Lefebvre included the following:
* Condemnation of the 1789 French Revolution and what he called its &quot;Masonic and anti-Catholic principles&quot;.
* Support for the &quot;Catholic order&quot; of the authoritarian French Vichy government (1940–1944) of Marshal Philippe Pétain.
* Support for the National Front led by Jean-Marie Le Pen.
* Opposition to Muslim immigration into Europe. In 1990, Lefebvre was convicted in a French court and sentenced to pay a fine of 5,000 francs when he stated in this connection that &quot;it is your wives, your daughters, your children who will be kidnapped and dragged off to a certain kind of places as they exist in Casablanca&quot;.

== Society of Saint Pius X ==
===Lawful formation===

After retiring from the post of Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by traditionalists from the French Seminary in Rome who had been refused tonsure, the rite by which, until 1973, a seminarian became a cleric. They asked for a conservative seminary to complete their studies. After directing them to the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, Lefebvre was urged to teach these seminarians personally. In 1969, he received permission from the local bishop to establish a seminary in Fribourg which opened with nine students, moving to Écône, Switzerland in 1971. 

Lefebvre proposed to his seminarians the establishment of a society of priests without vows. In November 1970, Bishop François Charrière of Fribourg established, on a provisional (&quot;ad experimentum&quot;) basis for six years, the International Priestly Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX) as a &quot;pious union&quot;. He chose the name of Pope Saint Pius X as the patron saint of the society, because of his admiration for the pontiff&#x27;s stance on modernism.

===Early opposition===
In November 1972, the bishops of France, gathered as the Plenary Assembly of French Bishops at Lourdes, whose theological outlook was quite different from Lefebvre&#x27;s, treated the then-legal Écône seminary with suspicion and referred to it as &quot;Séminaire sauvage&quot; or &quot;Outlaw Seminary&quot;. They indicated that they would incardinate none of the seminarians. Cardinal Secretary of State Jean-Marie Villot accused Lefebvre before Pope Paul VI of making his seminarians sign a condemnation of the Pope, which Lefebvre vigorously denied.

===Apostolic Visitors===

In November 1974, two Belgian priests carried out a rigorous inspection on the instructions of a commission of cardinals, producing, the SSPX claims, a favourable report. In what he later described as a mood of &quot;doubtlessly excessive indignation&quot;, on 21 November 1974, Lefebvre wrote a &quot;Declaration&quot; in which he attacked the modernist and liberal trends that he saw in the reforms being undertaken within the church at that time:
The Commission of Cardinals declared in reply that the declaration was &quot;unacceptable on all points&quot;. At the same time, the French episcopate indicated that they would not incardinate any of Lefebvre&#x27;s priests in their dioceses.

In January 1975, Bishop Pierre Mamie, who had succeeded Charrière in Fribourg in 1970, determined that the SSPX&#x27;s status as a &quot;pious union&quot; should end. On 24 January 1975, he asked the prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Religious, Cardinal Arturo Tabera, to terminate its status as a &quot;pious union&quot;.

On 13 February, Lefebvre was invited to Rome for a meeting with the commission of cardinals, which he described as &quot;a close cross examination of the judicial type&quot;, regarding the contents of his &quot;Declaration&quot;, followed by a second meeting on 3 March. In May, the commission announced it approved Mamie&#x27;s plan. Lefebvre contended that canon law gave the pope alone the authority to suppress a religious congregation, and only by his direct decree.

Tabera responded in April expressing full agreement and telling Mamie to proceed himself, and Mamie suppressed the SSPX on 6 May 1975, effective immediately. This action was upheld by Pope Paul, who wrote to Lefebvre in June 1975. Lefebvre nevertheless continued his work citing legal advice from canon lawyers that the Society had not been &quot;legally suppressed&quot; and that the Society continued to enjoy the privilege of incardinating its own priests. Lefebvre also argued that there were insufficient grounds for suppression as the Apostolic Visitors, by the Commission&#x27;s own admission, delivered a positive report, and that since his Declaration had not been condemned by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, he appealed, twice, to the appellate court of the church, the Apostolic Signatura. Lefebvre later wrote that Cardinal Villot blocked the move, and one of his supporters wrote that Villot threatened the Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura, Cardinal Dino Staffa, with dismissal if the appeals were not denied.

In 1976, Mamie warned Lefebvre that saying Mass though Catholic Church authorities had forbidden him from exercising his priestly functions would further exacerbate his relationship with Rome.

=== Disagreement with the Vatican ===
During the consistory of 24 May 1976, Pope Paul VI criticized Lefebvre by name and appealed to him and his followers to change their minds.
On 29 June 1976, Lefebvre went ahead with planned priestly ordinations without the approval of the local bishop and despite receiving letters from Rome forbidding them. As a result Lefebvre was suspended &quot;a collatione ordinum&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, forbidden to ordain any priests. A week later, the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops informed him that, to have his situation regularized, he needed to ask the pope&#x27;s pardon. Lefebvre responded with a letter claiming that the modernization of the church was a &quot;compromise with the ideas of modern man&quot; originating in a secret agreement between high dignitaries in the church and senior Freemasons before the council. Lefebvre was then notified that, since he had not apologized to the pope, he was suspended &quot;a divinis&quot;, i.e., he could no longer legally administer &quot;any&quot; of the sacraments. Lefebvre remarked that he had been forbidden from celebrating the new rite of Mass. Pope Paul apparently took this seriously and stated that Lefebvre &quot;thought he dodged the penalty by administering the sacraments using the previous formulas&quot;. In spite of his suspension, Lefebvre continued to celebrate Mass and to administer the other sacraments, including the conferral of Holy Orders to the students of his seminary.

Pope Paul received Lefebvre in audience on 11 September 1976, and one month later wrote to him a letter severely admonishing him and repeating the appeal he had made at the audience. In his letter to Lefebvre, Paul VI ordered him to accept the documents of the Second Vatican Council in their obvious meaning (&quot;sensu obvio&quot;) and the subsequent reforms, to retract his accusations against the Roman Pontiff and his collaborators and recognise the authority of the local bishops; furthermore, he demanded that Lefebvre hand over all activities of the FSSPX to the Holy See. The Pope reminded Lefebvre of his duty of obedience to the Chair of Peter, quoting the dogmatic constitutions &quot;Pastor aeternus&quot; (1870, First Vatican Council) and &quot;Lumen gentium&quot; (1964, Second Vatican Council).

Following the death of Paul VI, both Pope John Paul I and Pope John Paul II made various attempts to reconcile the FSSPX with the Church; the latter received Lefebvre in audience sixty days after his 1978 election, where he repeatedly expressed his desire for peace.

== Écône consecrations ==
In a 1987 sermon, Lefebvre, his health failing at age 81, announced his intention to consecrate a bishop to carry on his work after his death. Under Catholic canon law, the consecration of a bishop without the permission of the pope incurs excommunication: &quot;A bishop who consecrates someone a bishop without a pontifical mandate and the person who receives the consecration from him incur a &quot;latae sententiae&quot; excommunication reserved to the Apostolic See&quot;.

During 1987 Lefebvre tried to reach an agreement with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. However, on 4 September 1987, in Ecône, Lefebvre stated that the Vatican was in apostasy and that he would no longer collaborate with Ratzinger.

On 5 May 1988, Lefebvre signed an agreement with Ratzinger to regularize the situation of the Society of St Pius X. Ratzinger agreed that one bishop would be consecrated for the Society, to be approved by the pope.

=== Breaking of the agreement, consecrations ===

Shortly after the agreement, however, Lefebvre announced that he had received a note from Ratzinger that asked him &quot;to beg pardon for [his] errors&quot;, which he interpreted to mean that he would be made to accept the teachings of the Second Vatican Council and the &quot;spirit of Assisi&quot;. Lefebvre referred to the alleged prophecy of Our Lady of La Salette that &quot;Rome will lose the Faith&quot; and declared himself obliged to consecrate a successor—if necessary, without papal approval. As the agreement did not specify a date for the episcopal consecration, should Lefebvre have died before it was granted, the Society would have been unable to ordain any seminarians and forced into submission to the Holy See.

Lefebvre dubbed his plan &quot;Operation Survival&quot;:

Pope John Paul II appealed to him not to proceed in &quot;a schismatic act&quot;, warning of &quot;theological and canonical consequences&quot;.

On 30 June 1988, Lefebvre, with Bishop Emeritus Antônio de Castro Mayer of Campos, Brazil, as co-consecrator, consecrated four SSPX priests as bishops: Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson, Alfonso de Galarreta and Bernard Fellay.

Shortly before the consecrations, Lefebvre gave the following sermon:
... this ceremony, which is apparently done against the will of Rome, is in no way a schism. We are not schismatics! If an excommunication was pronounced against the bishops of China, who separated themselves from Rome and put themselves under the Chinese government, one very easily understands why Pope Pius XII excommunicated them. There is no question of us separating ourselves from Rome, nor of putting ourselves under a foreign government, nor of establishing a sort of parallel church as the Bishops of Palmar de Troya have done in Spain. They have even elected a pope, formed a college of cardinals... It is out of the question for us to do such things. Far from us be this miserable thought to separate ourselves from Rome!

The next day, 1 July, the Congregation for Bishops issued a decree stating that this was a schismatic act and that all six direct participants had incurred automatic excommunication.

=== Aftermath ===
On 2 July, Pope John Paul II condemned the consecration in his apostolic letter &quot;Ecclesia Dei&quot;, in which he stated that the consecration constituted a schismatic act and that the bishops and priests involved were automatically excommunicated:

Lefebvre responded by contradicting Pope John Paul II, saying that he and the other clerics involved had not &quot;separated themselves from Rome&quot; and were not schismatic. He invoked canon 1323 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law that they &quot;found themselves in a case of necessity&quot;, not having succeeded, as they said, in making &quot;Rome&quot; understand that &quot;this change which has occurred in the Church&quot; since the Second Vatican Council was &quot;not Catholic&quot;. In a letter addressed to the four priests he was about to consecrate as bishops, Lefebvre wrote: &quot;I do not think one can say that Rome has not lost the Faith.&quot;

On 18 July, twelve priests and some seminarians led by Josef Bisig left the SSPX because of the Ecône consecrations. Bisig became the first superior general of the newly formed Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP), a group that reached an agreement with the Holy See.

== Death ==
Lefebvre died from cancer on 25 March 1991 at the age of 85 in Martigny, Switzerland. Eight days later he was buried in the crypt at the society&#x27;s international seminary in Écône. Archbishop Edoardo Rovida, Apostolic Nuncio to Switzerland, and Bishop Henri Schwery of Sion, the local diocese, came and prayed at his body.

== Legacy of the 1988 consecrations ==
=== Lifting of excommunications ===

On 10 March 2009, at the request of the four surviving bishops, Pope Benedict XVI lifted their excommunications. In a letter to the bishops of the entire Church, Benedict offered this clarification:
 One of the four bishops, Richard Williamson, was subsequently expelled from the FSSPX in 2012 and excommunicated again in 2015 by Pope Francis for consecrating a bishop without permission of the Holy See.

=== Episcopal lineage ===

<doc id="78579" wikidata="Q210303" url="?curid=78579" title="Hippolyta">
<text>In Greek mythology, Hippolyta, or Hippolyte (; &quot;Hippolytē&quot;), was a daughter of Ares and Otrera, queen of the Amazons, and a sister of Antiope and Melanippe. She wore her father Ares&#x27; &quot;zoster&quot;, the Greek word found in the Iliad and elsewhere meaning &quot;war belt&quot;. Some English translations prefer &quot;girdle&quot;. Hippolyta figures prominently in the myths of both Heracles and Theseus. The myths about her are so varied it is thought that they may be about different women. The name &quot;Hippolyta&quot; translates as &quot;she who unleashes the horses&quot;, deriving from two Greek roots meaning &quot;horse&quot; and &quot;let loose&quot;.

== Legends ==
=== Ninth Labor of Heracles ===
In the myth of Heracles, Hippolyta&#x27;s belt (, &quot;zōstḗr Hippolytēs&quot;) was the object of his ninth labour. He was sent to retrieve it for Admete, the daughter of King Eurystheus. Most versions of the myth indicate that Hippolyta was so impressed with Heracles that she gave him the belt without argument (In some versions she engaged in sexual intercorse with Heracles), perhaps while visiting him on his ship. Then, according to Apollodorus, the goddess Hera, making herself appear as one of the Amazons, spread a rumour among them that Heracles and his crew were abducting their queen, so the Amazons attacked the ship. Among Hippolyta&#x27;s warriors was Aella, who was the first to charge at Heracles during the battle. Despite her courage, she fell to Heracles, who, clad in the invulnerable skin of the Nemean lion, defeated her and the other Amazons. Ultimately, he overpowered Hippolyta, stripped her of the belt, and sailed away, thus fulfilling his labor.

=== Adventure of Theseus ===
In the myth of Theseus, the hero joined Heracles in his expedition or went on a separate expedition later, and was the one who had the encounter with Hippolyta. Some versions say he abducted her, some that Heracles did the abducting but gave her to Theseus as spoils, and others say that she fell in love with Theseus and betrayed the Amazons by willingly leaving with him. In any case, she was taken to Athens where she was wed to Theseus. In some renditions, the other Amazons became enraged at the marriage and attacked Athens. This was the Attic War, in which they were defeated by Athenian forces under Theseus or Heracles. In other renditions, Theseus later put Hippolyta aside to marry Phaedra. So Hippolyta rallied her Amazons to attack the wedding ceremony. When the defenders closed the doors on the attackers, either Hippolyta was killed, Theseus directly killed her in the fight, she was accidentally killed by another Amazon, Molpadia, while fighting by Theseus&#x27; side, or was accidentally killed by her sister Penthesilea during this battle or in a separate incident. This killer was in turn slain by Theseus or Achilles. Some stories paint Theseus in a more favorable light, saying that Hippolyta was dead before he and Phaedra were wed, and this battle did not occur. Further complicating the narratives, several ancient writers say the Amazon in question was not Hippolyta at all, but her sister Antiope, Melanippe, or Glauce. Moreover, there are combined versions of the tale in which Heracles abducts and kills Hippolyta while Theseus, assisted by Sthenelus and Telamon, abducts and marries Antiope. There are also stories that Hippolyta or Antiope later bore Theseus a son, Hippolytus of Athens.

== Shakespeare character ==

In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Hippolyta is engaged to Theseus, the duke of Athens. In Act I, Scene 1 she and he discuss their fast-approaching wedding, which will take place under the new moon in four days (I.i.2). Theseus declares to Hippolyta that, although he &quot;wooed her with his sword,&quot; he will wed her &quot;with pomp, with triumph, and with revelling&quot; and promises to begin a celebration that will continue until the wedding (I.i.19).

The characterization of Hippolyta in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (as well as that of Theseus), like many other mytho-historical characters found in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, is based on ancient biographical accounts found in Plutarch&#x27;s work &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;. In &quot;The Life of Theseus&quot;, according to Plutarch, it was Hippolyta who concluded a four month long war between Athens and the Amazons with a peace treaty, resulting in the marriage between Theseus and Hippolyta. The representation of Hippolyta and Theseus in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; appears to be the playwright&#x27;s invention.

The character Hippolyta appears in &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;, a play co-written by Shakespeare and John Fletcher.
