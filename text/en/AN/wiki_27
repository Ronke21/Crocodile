<text>Celeron is a series of IA-32 and x86-64 computer microprocessors targeted at low-cost personal computers, manufactured by Intel from 1998 until 2023.

The first Celeron-branded CPU was introduced on April 15, 1998, and was based on the Pentium II. Celeron-branded processors released from 2009 to 2023 are compatible with IA-32 software. They typically offer less performance per clock speed compared to flagship Intel CPU lines, such as the Pentium or Core brands. They often have less cache or intentionally disabled advanced features, with variable impact on performance. While some Celeron designs have achieved strong performance for their segment, the majority of the Celeron line has exhibited noticeably degraded performance. This has been the primary justification for the higher cost of other Intel CPU brands versus the Celeron range.

In September 2022, Intel announced that the Celeron brand, along with Pentium, were to be replaced with the new &quot;Intel Processor&quot; branding for low-end processors in laptops from 2023 onwards. This applied to desktops using Celeron processors as well, and was discontinued around the same time laptops stopped using Celeron processors in favor of &quot;Intel Processor&quot; processors in 2023.

== Background ==
As a product concept, the Celeron was introduced in response to Intel&#x27;s loss of the low-end market, in particular to the Cyrix 6x86, the AMD K6, and the IDT Winchip. Intel&#x27;s existing low-end product, the Pentium MMX, was no longer performance-competitive at 233 MHz. Although a faster Pentium MMX would have been a lower-risk strategy, the industry-standard Socket 7 platform hosted a market of competitor CPUs that could be drop-in replacements for the Pentium MMX. Instead, Intel pursued a budget part that was to be pin-compatible with their high-end Pentium II product, using the Pentium II&#x27;s proprietary Slot 1 interface.

The Celeron also effectively killed off the nine-year-old 80486 chip, which had been the low-end processor brand for entry-level desktops and laptops until 1998.

Intel hired marketing firm Lexicon Branding, which had originally come up with the name &quot;Pentium&quot;, to devise a name for the new product as well. The &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; described Lexicon&#x27;s reasoning behind the name they chose: &quot;&quot;&quot; is Latin for swift, as in the word &#x27;accelerate&#x27;, and &#x27;on&#x27; as in &#x27;turned on&#x27;. Celeron is seven letters and three syllables, like Pentium. The &#x27;Cel&#x27; of Celeron rhymes with &#x27;tel&#x27; of Intel.&quot;

== Desktop Celerons ==

=== P6-based Celerons ===
==== Covington ====

Launched in April 1998, the first &quot;Covington&quot; Celeron was essentially a 266 MHz Pentium II manufactured without any secondary cache at all. Covington also shared the 80523 product code of Deschutes. Although clocked at 266 or 300 MHz (frequencies 33 or 66 MHz higher than the desktop version of the Pentium w/MMX), the cacheless Celerons had trouble outcompeting the parts they were designed to replace. Substantial numbers were sold on first release, largely on the strength of the Intel name, but the Celeron quickly achieved a poor reputation both in the trade press and among computer professionals. The initial market interest faded rapidly in the face of its poor performance, and with sales at a very low level, Intel felt obliged to develop a substantially faster replacement as soon as possible. Nevertheless, the first Celerons were quite popular among some overclockers, for their flexible overclockability and reasonable price. Covington was only manufactured in Slot 1 SEPP format.

==== Mendocino ====
 

The &quot;Mendocino&quot; Celeron, launched August 24, 1998, was the first retail CPU to use on-die L2 cache. Whereas Covington had no secondary cache at all, Mendocino included 128 KB of L2 cache running at full clock rate. The first Mendocino-core Celeron was clocked at a then-modest 300 MHz but offered almost twice the performance of the old cacheless Covington Celeron at the same clock rate. To distinguish it from the older Covington 300 MHz, Intel called the Mendocino core Celeron &quot;300A&quot;. Although the other Mendocino Celerons (the 333 MHz part, for example) did not have an &quot;A&quot; appended, some people call all Mendocino processors &quot;Celeron-A&quot; regardless of clock rate.

The new Mendocino-core Celeron was a good performer from the outset. Indeed, most industry analysts regarded the first Mendocino-based Celerons as &quot;too&quot; successful—performance was sufficiently high to not only compete strongly with rival parts, but also to attract buyers away from Intel&#x27;s high-profit flagship, the Pentium II. Overclockers soon discovered that, given a high-end motherboard, many Celeron 300A CPUs could run reliably at 450 MHz. This was achieved by simply increasing the front-side bus (FSB) clock rate from the stock 66 MHz to the 100 MHz clock of the Pentium II, helped by several facts: the 440BX chipset with nominal support for 100 MHz and correspondent memory had already been on the market, and the internal L2 cache was more tolerant to overclocking than external cache chips, which already had to run at half-CPU speed by design. At this frequency, the budget Mendocino Celeron rivaled the fastest x86 processors available. Some motherboards were designed to prevent this modification, by restricting the Celeron&#x27;s front side bus to 66 MHz. However, overclockers soon found that putting tape over pin B21 of the Celeron&#x27;s interface slot circumvented this, allowing a 100 MHz bus.

At the time on-die cache was difficult to manufacture; especially L2 as more of it is needed to attain an adequate level of performance. A benefit of on-die cache is that it operates at the same clock rate as the CPU. All other Intel CPUs at that time used motherboard mounted or slot mounted secondary L2 cache, which was very easy to manufacture, cheap, and simple to enlarge to any desired size (typical cache sizes were 512 KB or 1 MB), but they carried the performance penalty of slower cache performance, typically running at a FSB frequency of 60 to 100 MHz. The Pentium II&#x27;s 512 KB of L2 cache was implemented with a pair of relatively high-performance L2 cache chips mounted on a special-purpose board alongside the processor itself, running at half the processor&#x27;s clock rate and communicating with the CPU through a special back-side bus. This method of cache placement was expensive and imposed practical cache-size limits, but allowed the Pentium II to be clocked higher and avoided front side bus RAM/L2 cache contention typical with motherboard-placed L2 cache configurations.

Over time, newer Mendocino processors were released at 333, 366, 400, 433, 466, 500, and 533 MHz. The Mendocino Celeron CPU came only designed for a 66 MHz front-side bus, but this would not be a serious performance bottleneck until clock rates reached higher levels.

The Mendocino Celerons also introduced new packaging. When the Mendocinos debuted they came in both a Slot 1 SEPP and Socket 370 PPGA package. The Slot 1 form had been designed to accommodate the off-chip cache of the Pentium II and had mounting problems with motherboards. Because all Celerons are a single-chip design, however, there was no reason to retain the slot packaging for L2 cache storage, and Intel discontinued the Slot 1 variant; beginning with the 466 MHz part, only the PPGA Socket 370 form was offered. (Third-party manufacturers made motherboard slot-to-socket adapters (nicknamed Slotkets) available for a few dollars, which allowed, for example, a Celeron 500 to be fitted to a Slot 1 motherboard.) One interesting note about the PPGA Socket 370 Mendocinos is they supported symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and there was at least one motherboard released (the ABIT BP6) which took advantage of this fact.

The Mendocino also came in a mobile variant, with clock rates of 266, 300, 333, 366, 400, 433 and 466 MHz.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Mendocino CPUs are family 6, model 6 and their Intel product code is 80524. These identifiers are shared with the related &quot;Dixon&quot; Mobile Pentium II variant.

==== Coppermine-128 ====
The next generation Celeron was the &quot; &#x27;Coppermine-128&#x27; &quot; (sometimes known as the &quot;Celeron II&quot;). These were a derivative of Intel&#x27;s &quot;Coppermine&quot; Pentium III and were released on March 29, 2000. This Celeron used a Coppermine core with half of its L2 cache switched off, resulting in 128 KB of 4-way associative on-chip L2 cache as on the Mendocino, and was initially likewise restricted to a 66 MHz Front Side Bus speed. Despite the halved associativity on the L2 cache, which reduced hit rates compared to the full Coppermine design, it kept the 256-bit wide L2 cache bus, which meant an advantage compared to Mendocino and older Katmai/Pentium II designs, which all had a 64-bit datapath to their L2 caches. SSE instructions were also enabled.

All Coppermine-128s were produced in the same FCPGA Socket 370 format that most Coppermine Pentium III CPUs used. These Celeron processors began at 533 MHz and continued through 566, 600, 633, 667, 700, 733, and 766 MHz. Because of the limitations of the 66 MHz bus, there were diminishing returns on performance as clock rates increased. On January 3, 2001, Intel switched to a 100 MHz bus with the launch of the 800 MHz Celeron, resulting in a significant performance-per-clock improvement. All Coppermine-128 CPUs from 800 MHz and higher use the 100 MHz front side bus. Various models were made at 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, and 1100 MHz.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Coppermine Celerons and Pentium IIIs are family 6, model 8 and their Intel product code is 80526.

==== Tualatin-256 ====

These Celeron processors, released initially at 1.2 GHz on October 2, 2001, were based on the Pentium III &#x27;Tualatin&#x27; core and made with a 0.13 micrometer process for the FCPGA 2 Socket 370. They were nicknamed &quot;Tualeron&quot; by some enthusiasts — a portmanteau of the words Tualatin and Celeron. Some software and users refer to the chips as &quot;Celeron-S&quot;, referring to the chip&#x27;s lineage with the Pentium III-S, but this is not an official designation. Intel later released 1 GHz and 1.1 GHz parts (which were given the extension &quot;A&quot; to their name to differentiate them from the Coppermine-128 of the same clock rate they replaced). A 1.3 GHz chip, launched January 4, 2002, and finally a 1.4 GHz chip, launched May 15, 2002 (the same day as the 1.7 GHz Willamette-based Celeron launch), marked the end of the Tualatin-256 line.

The most significant differences compared to the Pentium III Tualatin are a lower 100 MHz bus and fixed 256 KB of L2 cache (whereas the Pentium III was offered with either 256 KB or 512 KB L2 cache); cache associativity stayed at 8-way, although the newly introduced data prefetching appears to have been disabled. Furthermore, the Tualatin-256&#x27;s L2 cache has a higher latency which boosted manufacturing yields for this budget CPU. On the other hand, this improved stability when overclocking and most of them had no problem working at 133 MHz FSB for a substantial performance increase.

Despite offering much improved performance over the Coppermine Celeron it superseded, the Tualatin Celeron still suffered stiff competition from AMD&#x27;s Duron budget processor. Intel later responded by releasing the NetBurst Willamette Celeron, and for some time Tualatin Celerons were manufactured and sold in parallel with the Pentium 4-based Celerons that replaced them.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Tualatin Celerons and Pentium IIIs are family 6, model 11 and their Intel product code is 80530.

=== NetBurst-based Celerons ===
==== Willamette-128 ====
These Celerons were for socket 478 and were based on the &quot;Willamette&quot; Pentium 4 core, being a completely different design compared to the previous Tualatin Celeron. These are often known as the &quot;Celeron 4&quot;. Their L2 cache (128 KB) is half that of the &quot;Willamette&quot;-based Pentium 4&#x27;s 256 KB of L2 cache, but otherwise the two are very similar. With the transition to the Pentium 4 core the Celeron now featured SSE2 instructions. The ability to share the same socket as the Pentium 4 meant that the Celeron now had the option to use RDRAM, DDR SDRAM, or traditional SDRAM. Willamette Celerons were launched May 15, 2002, initially at 1.7 GHz, and offered a noticeable performance improvement over the older 1.3 GHz &quot;Tualatin&quot;-based Celeron part, being able to finally outperform a 1.3 GHz AMD Duron, which at the time was AMD&#x27;s top competing budget processor. On June 12, 2002, Intel launched the last Willamette Celeron, a 1.8 GHz model. It contains 42 million transistors and has a die area of 217 mm2.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Willamette Celerons and Pentium 4s are family 15, model 1, and their Intel product code is 80531.

==== Northwood-128 ====
These socket 478 Celerons are based on the &quot;Northwood&quot; Pentium 4 core, and also have 128 KB of L2 cache. The only difference between the &quot;Northwood-128&quot;-based and the &quot;Willamette-128&quot;-based Celeron is the fact that it was built on the new 130 nm process which shrank the die size, increased the transistor count, and lowered the core voltage from 1.7 V on the &quot;Willamette-128&quot; to 1.52 V for the &quot;Northwood-128&quot;. Despite these differences, they are functionally the same as the Willamette-128 Celeron, and perform largely the same clock-for-clock. The &quot;Northwood-128&quot; family of processors were initially released as a 2 GHz core (a 1.9 GHz model was announced earlier, but never launched) on September 18, 2002. Since that time Intel has released a total of 10 different clock speeds ranging from 1.8 GHz to 2.8 GHz, before being surpassed by the Celeron D. Although the &quot;Northwood&quot;-based Celerons suffer considerably from their small L2 cache, some clock rates have been favored in the enthusiast market because, like the old 300A, they can run well above their specified clock rate.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Northwood Celerons and Pentium 4s are family 15, model 2, and their Intel product code is 80532.

==== Prescott-256 ====

Prescott-256 Celeron D processors, initially launched June 25, 2004, featuring double the L1 cache (16 KB) and L2 cache (256 KB) as compared to the previous Willamette and Northwood desktop Celerons, by virtue of being based on the &quot;Prescott&quot; Pentium 4 core.

It also features a 533 MT/s bus and SSE3, and a 3xx model number (compared to 5xx for Pentium 4s and 7xx for Pentium Ms). The Prescott-256 Celeron D was manufactured for Socket 478 and LGA 775, with 3x0 and 3x5 designations from 310 through to 355 at clock speeds of 2.13 GHz to 3.33 GHz.

The Intel Celeron D processor works with the Intel 845 and 865 chipset families. The &quot;D&quot; suffix actually has no official designation and does not indicate that these models are dual-core. It is used simply to distinguish this line of Celeron from the previous, lower performing Northwood and Willamette series, and also from the mobile series, the Celeron M (which also uses 3xx model numbers). Unlike the Pentium D, the Celeron D is &quot;not&quot; a dual core processor.

The Celeron D was a major performance improvement over previous NetBurst-based Celerons. A test using a variety of applications, run by Derek Wilson at Anandtech.com, showed that the new Celeron D architecture alone offered up performance improvements on average of &gt;10% over a Northwood Celeron when both CPUs were run at the same bus and clock rate. This CPU also had the addition of SSE3 instructions and the higher FSB which only contributed to this already impressive gain.

Despite its many improvements, the &quot;Prescott&quot; core of the Celeron D had at least one major drawback heat. Unlike the fairly cool-running Northwood Celeron, the Prescott-256 had a class-rated TDP of 73 W, which prompted Intel to include a more intricate copper core/aluminum finned cooler to help handle the additional heat.

In mid-2005, Intel refreshed the Celeron D with Intel 64 and XD Bit (eXecute Disable) enabled. Model numbers increase by 1 over the previous generation (e.g., 330 became 331). This only applied to LGA 775 Celeron Ds. There are no Socket 478 CPUs with XD Bit capabilities.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Prescott Celeron Ds and Pentium 4s are family 15, model 3 (up to stepping E0) or 4 (stepping E0 onwards), and their Intel product code is 80546 or 80547, depending on socket type.

==== Cedar Mill-512 ====
Based on the &quot;Cedar Mill&quot; Pentium 4 core, this version of the Celeron D was launched May 28, 2006, and continued the 3xx naming scheme with the Celeron D 347 (3.06 GHz), 352 (3.2 GHz), 356 (3.33 GHz), 360 (3.46 GHz), and 365 (3.6 GHz). The Cedar Mill Celeron D is largely the same as the Prescott-256, except with double the L2 cache (512 KB) and based on a 65 nm manufacturing process. The Cedar Mill-512 Celeron D is LGA 775 exclusive. The main benefits of the Cedar Mill Celerons over the Prescott Celerons are the slightly increased performance due to the larger L2 cache, higher clock rates, and less heat dissipation, with several models having a TDP lowered to 65 W from Prescott&#x27;s lowest offering of 73 W.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Cedar Mill Celeron Ds and Pentium 4s are family 15, model 6, and their Intel product code is 80552.

=== Core-based Celerons ===
==== Conroe-L ====
The Conroe-L Celeron is a single-core processor built on the Core microarchitecture and is thus clocked much lower than the Cedar Mill Celerons, but still outperforms them. It is based on the 65 nm Conroe-L core, and uses a 400-series model number sequence. The FSB was increased to 800 MT/s from 533 MT/s in this generation, and the TDP was decreased from 65 W to 35 W. As is traditional with Celerons, it does not have Intel VT-x instruction support or SpeedStep (although Enhanced Halt State is enabled, allowing the Celerons to lower the multiplier to 6× and decrease core voltage while idle). All Conroe-L models are single-core processors for the value segment of the market, much like the AMD K8-based Sempron. The product line was launched on June 5, 2007.

On October 21, 2007, Intel presented a new processor for its Intel Essential Series. The full name of the processor is Celeron 220 and is soldered on the D201GLY2 motherboard. With 1.2 GHz and a 512 KB L2 cache it has a TDP of 19 W and can be cooled passively. The Celeron 220 is the successor of the Celeron 215 which is based on a Yonah core and used on the D201GLY motherboard. This processor is exclusively used on the mini-ITX boards targeted to the sub-value market segment.

==== Allendale ====
Intel launched the dual core Celeron E1xxx processor line on January 20, 2008, based on the Allendale core. The CPU has 800 MT/s FSB, 65 W TDP and uses 512 KB of the chip&#x27;s 2 MB L2 cache, significantly limiting performance for uses such as gaming. New features to the Celeron family included full enhanced halt state and enhanced Intel SpeedStep technology. Clock rates range from 1.6 GHz to 2.4 GHz. It is compatible with other Allendale-based CPUs such as the Core 2 Duo E4xxx and Pentium Dual-Core E2xxx.

==== Wolfdale-3M ====

The Celeron E3000 series, starting with E3200 and E3300, was released in August 2009, featuring the Wolfdale-3M core used in Pentium Dual-Core E5000, Pentium E6000 and Core 2 Duo E7000 series. The main difference to Allendale-based Celeron processors is the support for Intel VT-x and increased performance due to the double L2 Cache of 1 MB.

=== Nehalem-based Celerons ===
==== Clarkdale ====

With the introduction of the Desktop Core i3 and Core i5 processor code named &quot;Clarkdale&quot; in January 2010, Intel also added a new Celeron line, starting with the Celeron G1101. This is the first Celeron to come with on-chip PCI Express and integrated graphics. Despite using the same Clarkdale chip as the Core i5-6xx line, it does not support Turbo Boost, HyperThreading, VT-d, SMT, Trusted Execution Technology or AES new instructions, and it comes with only 2 MB of third-level cache enabled.

==== Jasper Forest ====

The Celeron P1053 is an embedded processor for Socket 1366 from the &quot;Jasper Forest&quot; family. All other members of this family are known as Xeon C35xx or C55xx. The Jasper Forest chip is closely related to Lynnfield and contains four cores, 8 MB of L3 cache and a QPI interface, but most of these are disabled in the Celeron version, leaving a single core with 2 MB of L3 cache.

=== Sandy Bridge-based desktop Celerons ===
The Sandy Bridge-based Celeron processors were released in 2011. They are LGA 1155 processors (available in single- and dual-core versions) with integrated Intel HD Graphics GPU and containing up to 2 MB of L3 cache. Turbo-Boost, AVX and AES-NI have been disabled. Hyper-Threading is available on some single-core models, namely G460, G465 and G470.

=== Ivy Bridge-based desktop Celerons ===

All Celerons of this generation belong in the G16xx series. They give some boost in performance over Sandy Bridge-based Celerons due to a 22 nm die shrink, as well as some other minor improvements.

=== Haswell-based desktop Celerons ===
=== Skylake-based desktop Celerons ===
All Celerons of this generation added AES-NI and RDRAND instruction set.
=== Kaby Lake-based desktop Celerons ===

=== Coffee Lake-based desktop Celerons ===

=== Comet Lake-based desktop Celerons ===

=== Alder Lake-based desktop Celerons ===
== Mobile Celerons ==

=== P6-based mobile Celerons ===
==== Mendocino (mobile) ====

Similar to the Mendocino (Celeron-A): 250 nm, 32 KB L1 cache and 128 KB L2 cache, but uses a lower voltage (1.5–1.9 V) and two power-saving modes: Quick Start, and Deep Sleep. Packaged in the small, 615-pin BGA2 or Micro-PGA2 package.

==== Tualatin-256 (mobile) ====
These were the first Mobile Celerons based on the Tualatin core. They differed from their desktop counterparts in that the Mobile series were offered in both 100 MHz and 133 MHz FSB. Like the desktop Tualatins, these chips had 256 KB of L2 cache.

=== NetBurst-based mobile Celerons ===
==== Northwood-256 ====
These are the Mobile Celeron range used in laptops. Also based on the Northwood core, they feature a 256 KB L2 cache. These Celeron processors were a good deal higher performing than the desktop counterparts because of their larger L2 cache sizes. They were eventually replaced by the Celeron M brand which is built around the Pentium M processor design.

=== Pentium M-based mobile Celerons ===
==== Banias-512 ====
This Celeron (sold under the Celeron M brand) is based on the &quot;Banias&quot; Pentium M, and differs from its parent in that it has half the L2 cache, and does not support the clock-varying SpeedStep technology. It performs reasonably well compared to the Pentium M, but battery life is noticeably shorter on a Celeron M–based notebook than it is on a comparable Pentium M notebook.

A system based on the Celeron M processor may not use the Centrino brand name, regardless of what chipset and Wi-Fi components are used.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Banias Celeron Ms and Pentium Ms are family 6, model 9 and their Intel product code is 80535.

==== Shelton ====
The &quot;Shelton&quot; core is a Banias core without &quot;any&quot; L2 cache and SpeedStep. It is used in Intel&#x27;s small form factor D845GVSH motherboard, intended for Asian and South American markets. The processor identifies itself as a &quot;Intel Celeron 1.0B GHz&quot;, to differentiate it from the previous Coppermine-128 and Tualatin 1.0 GHz processors.

The Shelton&#x27;08 is a basic platform for a low cost notebook released by Intel at January 2008. The platform uses Intel&#x27;s single-core Diamondville CPU with a clock frequency of 1.6 GHz and a 533 MT/s FSB and power consumption of 3.5 W. The platform&#x27;s total power consumption is around 8 W, translating to battery usage time of between 3–4 hours. The platform consists of a 945GSE chipset, which includes built-in DirectX 9 graphics and supports single channel DDR2 memory. An 802.11g Wi-Fi module, USB/PATA port SSD (solid state drive), and a 7- or 8-inch panel will typically round out the platform.

==== Dothan-1024 ====
A 90 nm Celeron M with half of the L2 cache of the 90 nm &quot;Dothan&quot; Pentium Ms (twice the L2 cache of the 130 nm Celeron Ms, though), and, like its predecessor, lacking SpeedStep. The first Celeron Ms that supports the XD bit was released in January 2005, in general any Celeron M released after that supports the XD bit. There is also a 512 KB low voltage version that was used in the early ASUS Eee PC models.

In Intel&#x27;s &quot;Family/Model/Stepping&quot; scheme, Dothan Celeron Ms and Pentium Ms are family 6, model 13 and their Intel product code is 80536.

==== Yonah ====

The Celeron M 400-series is a 65 nm Celeron M based on the single-core Yonah chip, like the Core Solo. Like its predecessors in the Celeron M series, this Celeron M has half of the L2 cache (1 MB) of Core Solo and lacks SpeedStep. This core also brings new features to Celeron M including a higher front side bus (533 MT/s), SSE3 instructions. September 2006 and January 4, 2008, mark a discontinuation of many &quot;Celeron M&quot; branded CPUs.

=== Core-based mobile Celerons ===
==== Merom-L ====

The Celeron M 523 (933 MHz ULV), M 520 (1.6 GHz), M 530 (1.73 GHz), 530 (1.73 GHz), 540 (1.86 GHz), 550 (2.0 GHz), 560 (2.13 GHz), 570 (2.26 GHz) are single-core 65 nm CPUs based on the &quot;Merom&quot; Core 2 architecture. They feature a 533 MT/s FSB, 1 MB of L2 cache (half that of the low end Core 2 Duo&#x27;s 2 MB cache), XD-bit support, and Intel 64 technology, but lack SpeedStep and Virtualization Technology. Two different processor models are used with identical part numbers with the same part numbers, single-core Merom-L with 1 MB cache and dual-core Merom with 4 MB L2 cache that have the extra cache and core disabled. Celeron M 523, M 520 and M 530 are Socket M-based, while Celeron 530 through 570 (without the M) are for Socket P. January 4, 2008, marked the discontinuation of Merom CPUs.

==== Merom-2M ====

The Celeron 573 (1 GHz, ULV), 575 (2 GHz) and 585 (2.16 GHz) are based on the Merom-2M core with only one core and 1 MB L2 cache enabled. They are similar to the Merom and Merom-L based Celerons but have a faster 667 MT/s FSB.

The Celeron T1xxx processors are also based on the Merom-2M chips but have both cores enabled. The earlier T1400 (1.73 GHz) and T1500 (1.86 GHz) versions have a 533 MT/s FSB and 512 B L2 cache, while the more recent T1600 (1.66 GHz) and T1700 (1.83 GHz) versions have 667 MT/s and 1 MB L2 cache enabled but come with a lower clock frequency.

==== Penryn-3M ====
At the same time as the dual-core Merom-2M, Intel introduced the first 45 nm Celeron processor based on the Penryn-3M core with 800 MT/s FSB, 1 MB L2 cache and one core enabled. This includes the Celeron M 7xx Consumer Ultra-Low Voltage (CULV) series starting at 1.2 GHz and the later Celeron 900 (2.2 GHz).

The initial 45 nm dual-core Celeron processor was released in June 2009 and is also based on Penryn-3M. The Celeron T3000 (1.8 GHz) and T3100 (1.9 GHz) again come with 1 MB of L2 cache enabled and an 800 MT/s FSB. In September 2009, Intel also started the dual-core CULV Celeron SU2000 series, again with 1 MB L2 cache. Despite the similar name, they are very different from Pentium SU2000 (with 2 MB L2 cache and one active core) and Pentium T3000 (based on the 65 nm Merom processor).

=== Nehalem-based mobile Celerons ===
==== Arrandale ====
The Arrandale-based Celeron P4xxx and U3xxx lines are low-end versions of the Pentium P6xxx and U5xxx lines, originally released as the mobile dual-core lines of Core i3/i5/i7. Like the Clarkdale-based Celeron G1xxx, they use 2 MB of L3 cache, which is the amount that the earlier &quot;Penryn&quot; based CPUs used in the Pentium brand as their L2 cache. Like all Arrandale processors, the Celeron P4xxx and U3xxx use an integrated graphics core.

=== Sandy Bridge-based mobile Celerons ===

The Celeron B8xx processors released in 2011 follow the Arrandale line. They are Dual-Core processors with integrated graphics and use the same chips as the Pentium B9xx and Core i3/i5/i7-2xxx mobile processors, but with Turbo-Boost, Hyper-Threading, VT-d, TXT and AES-NI disabled and the L3 cache reduced to 2MB.

== Dual-processor support ==
As a budget processor, the Celeron does not support a dual-processor configuration using multiple CPU sockets, however it has been discovered that multiprocessing could be enabled on Slot 1 Celeron processors by connecting a pin on the CPU core to a contact on the processor card&#x27;s connector. In addition, Mendocino Socket 370 processors can use multiprocessing when used on specific dual Slot 1 motherboards by using a slot adapter.
The unofficial SMP support was removed in the Coppermine Celerons, and dual-socket support is now limited to higher-end Xeon server-class processors. Conroe/Allendale based Celeron processors and later support multiprocessing using multi-core chips, but are still limited to one socket.

The ABIT BP6 motherboard also allows two Mendocino Socket 370 Celeron processors to operate in a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) configuration without any modification to the CPUs or the motherboard.

<text>The slippery eight loop is an adjustable loop knot discovered by Dave Poston in 2002.

==Information==
The slippery eight loop is known — despite the name — to have an extraordinary ability to &quot;not&quot; slip and it is extremely secure when the legs are at less than a 90-degree angle. The man who created this knot, Dave Poston, requests that the name of the knot include &quot;HFP&quot; in order to honor his father, who originally introduced him to knots. So the whole name of the knot would be the &quot;HFP Slippery 8 Loop.&quot;

==Instructions==
The instructions on how to create a slippery eight loop is as follows:
#Begin by creating a figure eight knot with one end long enough to be looped through it again
#Make sure that the figure eight loop is not tight, but rather quite loose with obvious gaps
#Bring the long, working end to the top of the knot
#Pass the working end behind the standing line in the knot and feed the end through the Eight
#After the working end has been threaded through the knot, pull the knot tight
#Adjust the size of the loop by alternately pulling the different ends or one side of the loop

<text>The water bowline is a type of knot designed for use in wet conditions where other knots may slip or jam.

Although similar in finished appearance to the double bowline, the water bowline is formed with a clove hitch as the loop in the standing part of the rope. This is similar to the double bowline, which puts the running end through a round turn. The additional friction from the clove hitch increases the security of this knot.


The Water Bowline can be tied very quickly by throwing two half hitches over the working end and then running the working end around the standing line and back through both half hitches. This is illustrated in the three pictures below.

<doc id="77260" wikidata="Q135364" url="?curid=77260" title="Olmecs">
<text>The Olmecs () or Olmec were an early known major Mesoamerican civilization, flourishing in the modern-day Mexican states of Veracruz and Tabasco from roughly 1200 to 400 BCE during Mesoamerica&#x27;s formative period. They were initially centered at the site of their development in San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, but moved to La Venta in the 10th century BCE following the decline of San Lorenzo. The Olmecs disappeared mysteriously in the 4th century BCE, leaving the region sparsely populated until the 19th century.

Among other &quot;firsts&quot;, the Olmec appeared to practice ritual bloodletting and played the Mesoamerican ballgame, hallmarks of nearly all subsequent Mesoamerican societies. The aspect of the Olmecs most familiar now is their artwork, particularly the colossal heads. The Olmec civilization was first defined through artifacts which collectors purchased on the pre-Columbian art market in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Olmec artworks are considered among ancient America&#x27;s most striking.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Olmec&quot; means &quot;rubber people&quot; in Nahuatl, the language of the Nahuas, and was the Aztec term for the people who lived in the Gulf Lowlands in the 15th and 16th centuries, some 2,000 years after the Olmec culture died out. The term &quot;Rubber People&quot; refers to the ancient practice, spanning from ancient Olmecs to Aztecs, of extracting latex from &quot;Castilla elastica&quot;, a rubber tree in the area. The juice of a local vine, &quot;Ipomoea alba,&quot; was then mixed with this latex to create rubber as early as 1600 BCE. The Nahuatl word for the Olmecs was (singular) or (plural). This word is composed of the two words &quot;ōlli&quot; , meaning &quot;natural rubber&quot;, and &quot;mēcatl&quot; , meaning &quot;people&quot;.

Early modern explorers and archaeologists, however, mistakenly applied the name &quot;Olmec&quot; to the rediscovered ruins and artifacts in the heartland decades before it was understood that these were not created by the people the Aztecs knew as the &quot;Olmec&quot; but rather a culture that was 2000 years older. Despite the mistaken identity, the name has stuck.

It is not known what name the ancient Olmec used for themselves; some later Mesoamerican accounts seem to refer to the ancient Olmec as &quot;Tamoanchan&quot;. A contemporary term sometimes used for the Olmec culture is &quot;tenocelome&quot;, meaning &quot;mouth of the jaguar&quot;.

==Overview==
The Olmec heartland is the area in the Gulf lowlands where it expanded after early development in Soconusco, Veracruz. This area is characterized by swampy lowlands punctuated by low hills, ridges, and volcanoes. The Sierra de los Tuxtlas rises sharply in the north, along the Gulf of Mexico&#x27;s Bay of Campeche. Here, the Olmec constructed permanent city-temple complexes at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, La Venta, Tres Zapotes, and Laguna de los Cerros. In this region, the first Mesoamerican civilization emerged and reigned from  BCE.

===Origins===

Pre-Olmec cultures had flourished since about 2500 BCE, and it has been speculated that the Olmecs derived in part from the neighboring Mokaya or Mixe–Zoque cultures which developed during this time. The beginnings of Olmec civilization have traditionally been placed between 1400 BCE and 1200 BCE. Past finds of Olmec remains ritually deposited at the shrine El Manatí near the triple archaeological sites known collectively as San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán moved this back to at least 1600–1500 BCE. It seems that the Olmec had their roots in early farming cultures of Tabasco, which began between 5100 BCE and 4600 BCE. These shared the same basic food crops and technologies of the later Olmec civilization.

What is today called Olmec first appeared fully within San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, where distinctive Olmec features occurred around 1400 BCE. The rise of civilization was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered alluvial soil, as well as by the transportation network provided by the Coatzacoalcos river basin. This environment may be compared to that of other ancient centers of civilization such as the Nile, Indus, Yellow River and Mesopotamia. This highly productive environment encouraged a densely concentrated population, which in turn triggered the rise of an elite class. The elite class created the demand for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture. Many of these luxury artifacts were made from materials such as jade, obsidian, and magnetite, which came from distant locations and suggest that early Olmec elites had access to an extensive trading network in Mesoamerica. The source of the most valued jade was the Motagua River valley in eastern Guatemala, and Olmec obsidian has been traced to sources in the Guatemala highlands, such as El Chayal and San Martín Jilotepeque, or in Puebla, distances ranging from 200 to 400 km (120–250 miles) away, respectively.

The state of Guerrero, and in particular its early Mezcala culture, seem to have played an important role in the early history of Olmec culture. Olmec-style artifacts tend to appear earlier in some parts of Guerrero than in the Veracruz-Tabasco area. In particular, the relevant objects from the Amuco-Abelino site in Guerrero reveal dates as early as 1530 BCE. The city of Teopantecuanitlan in Guerrero is also relevant in this regard.

===La Venta===
The first Olmec center, San Lorenzo, was all but abandoned around 900 BCE at about the same time that La Venta rose to prominence. Widespread destruction of many San Lorenzo monuments also occurred around the 950s BCE, which may indicate an internal uprising or, less likely, an invasion. The latest thinking, however, is that environmental changes may have been responsible for this shift in Olmec centers, with certain important rivers changing course.

Following the decline of San Lorenzo, La Venta became the most prominent Olmec center, lasting from 900 BCE until its abandonment around 400 BCE. La Venta sustained the Olmec cultural traditions with spectacular displays of power and wealth. The Great Pyramid was the largest Mesoamerican structure of its time. Even today, after 2500 years of erosion, it rises above the naturally flat landscape. Buried deep within La Venta lay opulent, labor-intensive &quot;offerings&quot; – 1000 tons of smooth serpentine blocks, large mosaic pavements, and at least 48 separate votive offerings of polished jade celts, pottery, figurines, and hematite mirrors.

===Decline===
Scholars have yet to determine the cause of the eventual extinction of the Olmec culture. Between 400 and 350 BCE, the population in the eastern half of the Olmec heartland dropped precipitously, and the area was sparsely inhabited until the 19th century. According to archaeologists, this depopulation was probably the result of &quot;very serious environmental changes that rendered the region unsuited for large groups of farmers&quot;, in particular changes to the riverine environment that the Olmec depended upon for agriculture, hunting and gathering, and transportation. These changes may have been triggered by tectonic upheavals or subsidence, or the siltation of rivers due to agricultural practices.

One theory for the considerable population drop during the Terminal Formative period is suggested by Santley and colleagues (Santley et al. 1997), who propose the relocation of settlements due to volcanism, instead of extinction. Volcanic eruptions during the Early, Late and Terminal Formative periods would have blanketed the lands and forced the Olmec to move their settlements.

Whatever the cause, within a few hundred years of the abandonment of the last Olmec cities, successor cultures became firmly established. The Tres Zapotes site, on the western edge of the Olmec heartland, continued to be occupied well past 400 BCE, but without the hallmarks of the Olmec culture. This post-Olmec culture, often labeled the Epi-Olmec, has features similar to those found at Izapa, some to the southeast.

==Artifacts==
The Olmec culture was first defined as an art style, and this continues to be the hallmark of the culture. Wrought in a large number of media – jade, clay, basalt, and greenstone among others – much Olmec art, such as &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, is naturalistic. Other art expresses fantastic anthropomorphic creatures, often highly stylized, using an iconography reflective of a religious meaning. Common motifs include downturned mouths and a cleft head, both of which are seen in representations of werejaguars. In addition to making human and human-like subjects, Olmec artisans were adept at animal portrayals.

While Olmec figurines are found abundantly in sites throughout the Formative Period, the stone monuments such as the colossal heads are the most recognizable feature of Olmec culture. These monuments can be divided into four classes:
*Colossal heads (which can be up to tall);
*Rectangular &quot;altars&quot; (more likely thrones) such as Altar 5 shown below;
*Free-standing in-the-round sculpture, such as the twins from El Azuzul or San Martín Pajapan Monument 1; and
*Stele, such as La Venta Monument 19 above. The stelae form was generally introduced later than the colossal heads, altars, or free-standing sculptures. Over time, the stele changed from simple representation of figures, such as Monument 19 or La Venta Stela 1, toward representations of historical events, particularly acts legitimizing rulers. This trend would culminate in post-Olmec monuments such as La Mojarra Stela 1, which combines images of rulers with script and calendar dates.

===Colossal heads===

The most recognized aspect of the Olmec civilization are the enormous helmeted heads. As no known pre-Columbian text explains them, these impressive monuments have been the subject of much speculation. Once theorized to be ballplayers, it is now generally accepted that these heads are portraits of rulers, perhaps dressed as ballplayers. Infused with individuality, no two heads are alike and the helmet-like headdresses are adorned with distinctive elements, suggesting personal or group symbols. Some have also speculated that Mesoamerican people believed that the soul, along with all of one&#x27;s experiences and emotions, was contained inside the head.

Seventeen colossal heads have been unearthed to date.

The heads range in size from the Rancho La Cobata head, at high, to the pair at Tres Zapotes, at . Scholars calculate that the largest heads weigh between .
The heads were carved from single blocks or boulders of volcanic basalt, found in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas. The Tres Zapotes heads, for example, were sculpted from basalt found at the summit of Cerro el Vigía, at the western end of the Tuxtlas. The San Lorenzo and La Venta heads, on the other hand, were probably carved from the basalt of Cerro Cintepec, on the southeastern side, perhaps at the nearby Llano del Jicaro workshop, and dragged or floated to their final destination dozens of miles away. It has been estimated that moving a colossal head required the efforts of 1,500 people for three to four months.

Some of the heads, and many other monuments, have been variously mutilated, buried and disinterred, reset in new locations and/or reburied. Some monuments, and at least two heads, were recycled or recarved, but it is not known whether this was simply due to the scarcity of stone or whether these actions had ritual or other connotations. Scholars believe that some mutilation had significance beyond mere destruction, but some scholars still do not rule out internal conflicts or, less likely, invasion as a factor.

The flat-faced, thick-lipped heads have caused some debate due to their resemblance to some African facial characteristics. Based on this comparison, some writers have said that the Olmecs were Africans who had emigrated to the New World. But the vast majority of archaeologists and other Mesoamerican scholars reject claims of pre-Columbian contacts with Africa. Explanations for the facial features of the colossal heads include the possibility that the heads were carved in this manner due to the shallow space allowed on the basalt boulders. Others note that in addition to the broad noses and thick lips, the eyes of the heads often show the epicanthic fold, and that all these characteristics can still be found in modern Mesoamerican Indians. For instance, in the 1940s, the artist/art historian Miguel Covarrubias published a series of photos of Olmec artwork and of the faces of modern Mexican Indians with very similar facial characteristics. The African origin hypothesis assumes that Olmec carving was intended to be a representation of the inhabitants, an assumption that is hard to justify given the full corpus of representation in Olmec carving.

Ivan Van Sertima claimed that the seven braids on the Tres Zapotes head was an Ethiopian hair style, but he offered no evidence it was a contemporary style. The Egyptologist Frank J. Yurco has said that the Olmec braids do not resemble contemporary Egyptian or Nubian braids.

Richard Diehl wrote &quot;There can be no doubt that the heads depict the American Indian physical type still seen on the streets of Soteapan, Acayucan, and other towns in the region.&quot;

===Jade face masks===
Another type of artifact is much smaller; hardstone carvings in jade of a face in a mask form. Jade is a particularly precious material, and it was used as a mark of rank by the ruling classes. By 1500 BCE early Olmec sculptors mastered the human form. This can be determined by wooden Olmec sculptures discovered in the swampy bogs of El Manati. Before radiocarbon dating could tell the exact age of Olmec pieces, archaeologists and art historians noticed the unique &quot;Olmec-style&quot; in a variety of artifacts.

Curators and scholars refer to &quot;Olmec-style&quot; face masks but, to date, no example has been recovered in an archaeologically controlled Olmec context. They have been recovered from sites of other cultures, including one deliberately deposited in the ceremonial altepetl (precinct) of Tenochtitlan in what is now Mexico City. The mask would presumably have been about 2000 years old when the Aztecs buried it, suggesting such masks were valued and collected as were Roman antiquities in Europe. The &#x27;Olmec-style&#x27; refers to the combination of deep-set eyes, nostrils, and strong, slightly asymmetrical mouth. The &quot;Olmec-style&quot; also very distinctly combines facial features of both humans and jaguars. Olmec arts are strongly tied to the Olmec religion, which prominently featured jaguars. The Olmec people believed that in the distant past a race of werejaguars was made between the union of a jaguar and a woman. One werejaguar quality that can be found is the sharp cleft in the forehead of many supernatural beings in Olmec art. This sharp cleft is associated with the natural indented head of jaguars.

=== Kunz axes ===

The Kunz axes (also known as &quot;votive axes&quot;) are figures that represent werejaguars and were apparently used for rituals. In most cases, the head is half the total volume of the figure. All Kunz axes have flat noses and an open mouth. The name &quot;Kunz&quot; comes from George Frederick Kunz, an American mineralogist, who described a figure in 1890.

==Beyond the heartland==

Olmec-style artifacts, designs, figurines, monuments and iconography have been found in the archaeological records of sites hundreds of kilometres outside the Olmec heartland. These sites include:

===Central Mexico===
Tlatilco and Tlapacoya, major centers of the Tlatilco culture in the Valley of Mexico, where artifacts include hollow baby-face motif figurines and Olmec designs on ceramics.

Chalcatzingo, in Valley of Morelos, central Mexico, which features Olmec-style monumental art and rock art with Olmec-style figures.

Also, in 2007, archaeologists unearthed Zazacatla, an Olmec-influenced city in Morelos. Located about south of Mexico City, Zazacatla covered about between 800 and 500 BCE.

===Western Mexico===
Teopantecuanitlan, in Guerrero, which features Olmec-style monumental art as well as city plans with distinctive Olmec features.

Also, the Juxtlahuaca and Oxtotitlán cave paintings feature Olmec designs and motifs.

===Southern Mexico and Guatemala===
Olmec influence is also seen at several sites in the Southern Maya area.

In Guatemala, sites showing probable Olmec influence include San Bartolo, Takalik Abaj and La Democracia.

===Nature of interaction===
Many theories have been advanced to account for the occurrence of Olmec influence far outside the heartland, including long-range trade by Olmec merchants, Olmec colonization of other regions, Olmec artisans travelling to other cities, conscious imitation of Olmec artistic styles by developing towns – some even suggest the prospect of Olmec military domination or that the Olmec iconography was actually developed outside the heartland.

The generally accepted, but by no means unanimous, interpretation is that the Olmec-style artifacts, in all sizes, became associated with elite status and were adopted by non-Olmec Formative Period chieftains in an effort to bolster their status.

==Notable innovations==
In addition to their influence with contemporaneous Mesoamerican cultures, as the first civilization in Mesoamerica, the Olmecs are credited, or speculatively credited, with many &quot;firsts&quot;, including the bloodletting and perhaps human sacrifice, writing and epigraphy, and the invention of popcorn, zero and the Mesoamerican calendar, and the Mesoamerican ballgame, as well as perhaps the compass. Some researchers, including artist and art historian Miguel Covarrubias, even postulate that the Olmecs formulated the forerunners of many of the later Mesoamerican deities.

===Bloodletting and sacrifice speculation===
Although the archaeological record does not include explicit representation of Olmec bloodletting, researchers have found other evidence that the Olmec ritually practiced it. For example, numerous natural and ceramic stingray spikes and maguey thorns have been found at Olmec sites, and certain artifacts have been identified as bloodletters.

The argument that the Olmec instituted human sacrifice is significantly more speculative. No Olmec or Olmec-influenced sacrificial artifacts have yet been discovered; no Olmec or Olmec-influenced artwork unambiguously shows sacrificial victims (as do the &quot;danzante&quot; figures of Monte Albán) or scenes of human sacrifice (such as can be seen in the famous ballcourt mural from El Tajín).

At El Manatí, disarticulated skulls and femurs, as well as the complete skeletons of newborns or fetuses, have been discovered amidst the other offerings, leading to speculation concerning infant sacrifice. Scholars have not determined how the infants met their deaths. Some authors have associated infant sacrifice with Olmec ritual art showing limp werejaguar babies, most famously in La Venta&#x27;s Altar 5 (on the right) or Las Limas figure. Any definitive answer requires further findings.

===Writing===

The Olmec may have been the first civilization in the Western Hemisphere to develop a writing system. Symbols found in 2002 and 2006 date from 650 BCE and 900 BCE respectively, preceding the oldest Zapotec writing found so far, which dates from about 500 BCE.

The 2002 find at the San Andrés site shows a bird, speech scrolls, and glyphs that are similar to the later Maya script. Known as the Cascajal Block, and dated between 1100 and 900 BCE, the 2006 find from a site near San Lorenzo shows a set of 62 symbols, 28 of which are unique, carved on a serpentine block. A large number of prominent archaeologists have hailed this find as the &quot;earliest pre-Columbian writing&quot;. Others are skeptical because of the stone&#x27;s singularity, the fact that it had been removed from any archaeological context, and because it bears no apparent resemblance to any other Mesoamerican writing system.

There are also well-documented later hieroglyphs known as the Isthmian script, and while there are some who believe that the Isthmian may represent a transitional script between an earlier Olmec writing system and the Maya script, the matter remains unsettled.

===Mesoamerican Long Count calendar and invention of the zero concept===


The Long Count calendar used by many subsequent Mesoamerican civilizations, as well as the concept of zero, may have been devised by the Olmecs. Because the six artifacts with the earliest Long Count calendar dates were all discovered outside the immediate Maya homeland, it is likely that this calendar predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the Olmecs. Indeed, three of these six artifacts were found within the Olmec heartland. But an argument against an Olmec origin is the fact that the Olmec civilization had ended by the 4th century BCE, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count date artifact.

The Long Count calendar required the use of zero as a place-holder within its vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system. A shell glyph – – was used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates, the second oldest of which, on Stela C at Tres Zapotes, has a date of 32 BCE. This is one of the earliest uses of the zero concept in history.

===Mesoamerican ballgame===
The Olmec are strong candidates for originating the Mesoamerican ballgame so prevalent among later cultures of the region and used for recreational and religious purposes. A dozen rubber balls dating to 1600 BCE or earlier have been found in El Manatí, a bog east of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan. These balls predate the earliest ballcourt yet discovered at Paso de la Amada, c. 1400 BCE, although there is no certainty that they were used in the ballgame.

==Ethnicity and language==

While the actual ethno-linguistic affiliation of the Olmec remains unknown, various hypotheses have been put forward. For example, in 1968 Michael D. Coe speculated that the Olmec were Maya predecessors.

In 1976, linguists Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman published a paper in which they argued a core number of loanwords had apparently spread from a Mixe–Zoquean language into many other Mesoamerican languages. Campbell and Kaufman proposed that the presence of these core loanwords indicated that the Olmec – generally regarded as the first &quot;highly civilized&quot; Mesoamerican society – spoke a language ancestral to Mixe–Zoquean. The spread of this vocabulary particular to their culture accompanied the diffusion of other Olmec cultural and artistic traits that appears in the archaeological record of other Mesoamerican societies.

Mixe–Zoque specialist Søren Wichmann first critiqued this theory on the basis that most of the Mixe–Zoquean loans seemed to originate only from the Zoquean branch of the family. This implied the loanword transmission occurred in the period &quot;after&quot; the two branches of the language family split, placing the time of the borrowings outside of the Olmec period. However, new evidence has pushed back the proposed date for the split of Mixean and Zoquean languages to a period within the Olmec era. Based on this dating, the architectural and archaeological patterns and the particulars of the vocabulary loaned to other Mesoamerican languages from Mixe–Zoquean, Wichmann now suggests that the Olmecs of San Lorenzo spoke proto-Mixe and the Olmecs of La Venta spoke proto-Zoque.

At least the fact that the Mixe–Zoquean languages are still spoken in an area corresponding roughly to the Olmec heartland, and are historically known to have been spoken there, leads most scholars to assume that the Olmec spoke one or more Mixe–Zoquean languages.

==Religion==
Olmec religious activities were performed by a combination of rulers, full-time priests, and shamans. The rulers seem to have been the most important religious figures, with their links to the Olmec deities or supernaturals providing legitimacy for their rule. There is also considerable evidence for shamans in the Olmec archaeological record, particularly in the so-called &quot;transformation figures&quot;.

As no documentations of Olmec religious narratives and figures comparable to the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; has been left or found, any interpretation of Olmec religious narratives and figures must be based on interpretations of surviving monumental and portable art (such as the &quot;Señor de Las Limas&quot; statue at the Xalapa Museum), and comparisons with other seemingly similar elements found throughout nearby Mesoamerican cultures. Olmec art shows that such deities as Feathered Serpent and a supernatural rain were already in the Mesoamerican pantheon in Olmec times.

==Social and political organization==
Little is directly known about the societal or political structure of Olmec society. Although it is assumed by most researchers that the colossal heads and several other sculptures represent rulers, nothing has been found like the Maya stelae which name specific rulers and provide the dates of their rule.

Instead, archaeologists relied on the data that they had, such as large- and small-scale site surveys. These provided evidence of considerable centralization within the Olmec region, first at San Lorenzo and then at La Venta – no other Olmec sites come close to these in terms of area or in the quantity and quality of architecture and sculpture.

This evidence of geographic and demographic centralization leads archaeologists to propose that Olmec society itself was hierarchical, concentrated first at San Lorenzo and then at La Venta, with an elite that was able to use their control over materials such as water and monumental stone to exert command and legitimize their regime.

Nonetheless, Olmec society is thought to lack many of the institutions of later civilizations, such as a standing army or priestly caste. And there is no evidence that San Lorenzo or La Venta controlled, even during their heyday, all of the Olmec heartland. There is some doubt, for example, that La Venta controlled even Arroyo Sonso, only some away. Studies of the Sierra de los Tuxtlas settlements, some away, indicate that this area was composed of more or less egalitarian communities outside the control of lowland centers.

==Trade==
The wide diffusion of Olmec artifacts and &quot;Olmecoid&quot; iconography throughout much of Mesoamerica indicates the existence of extensive long-distance trade networks. Exotic, prestigious and high-value materials such as greenstone and marine shell were moved in significant quantities across large distances. Some of the reasons for trade revolve around the lack of obsidian in the heartland. The Olmec used obsidian in many tools because worked edges were very sharp and durable. Most of the obsidian found has been traced back to Guatemala showing the extensive trade. While the Olmec were not the first in Mesoamerica to organize long-distance exchanges of goods, the Olmec period saw a significant expansion in interregional trade routes, more variety in material goods exchanged and a greater diversity in the sources from which the base materials were obtained.

==Village life and diet==
Despite their size and deliberate urban design, which was copied by other centers, San Lorenzo and La Venta were largely ceremonial centers, and the majority of the Olmec lived in villages similar to present-day villages and hamlets in Tabasco and Veracruz.

These villages were located on higher ground and consisted of several scattered houses. A modest temple may have been associated with the larger villages. The individual dwellings would consist of a house, an associated lean-to, and one or more storage pits (similar in function to a root cellar). A nearby garden was used for medicinal and cooking herbs and for smaller crops, such as the domesticated sunflower. Fruit trees, such as avocado or cacao, were probably available nearby.

Although the river banks were used to plant crops between flooding periods, the Olmecs probably also practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to clear the forests and shrubs, and to provide new fields once the old fields were exhausted. Fields were located outside the village, and were used for maize, beans, squash, cassava, and sweet potato. Based on archaeological studies of two villages in the Tuxtlas Mountains, it is known that maize cultivation became increasingly important to the Olmec over time, although the diet remained fairly diverse.

The fruits and vegetables were supplemented with fish, turtle, snake, and mollusks from the nearby rivers, and crabs and shellfish in the coastal areas. Birds were available as food sources, as were game including peccary, opossum, raccoon, rabbit, and in particular, deer. Despite the wide range of hunting and fishing available, midden surveys in San Lorenzo have found that the domesticated dog was the single most plentiful source of animal protein.

==History of archaeological research==

Olmec culture was unknown to historians until the mid-19th century. In 1869, the Mexican antiquarian traveller José Melgar y Serrano published a description of the first Olmec monument to have been found &quot;in situ&quot;. This monument – the colossal head now labelled Tres Zapotes Monument A – had been discovered in the late 1850s by a farm worker clearing forested land on a &quot;hacienda&quot; in Veracruz. Hearing about the curious find while travelling through the region, Melgar y Serrano first visited the site in 1862 to see for himself and complete the partially exposed sculpture&#x27;s excavation. His description of the object, published several years later after further visits to the site, represents the earliest documented report of an artifact of what is now known as the Olmec culture.

In the latter half of the 19th century, Olmec artifacts such as the Kunz Axe (right) came to light and were subsequently recognized as belonging to a unique artistic tradition.

Frans Blom and Oliver La Farge made the first detailed descriptions of La Venta and San Martin Pajapan Monument 1 during their 1925 expedition. However, at this time, most archaeologists assumed the Olmec were contemporaneous with the Maya – even Blom and La Farge were, in their own words, &quot;inclined to ascribe them to the Maya culture&quot;.

Matthew Stirling of the Smithsonian Institution conducted the first detailed scientific excavations of Olmec sites in the 1930s and 1940s. Stirling, along with art historian Miguel Covarrubias, became convinced that the Olmec predated most other known Mesoamerican civilizations.

In counterpoint to Stirling, Covarrubias, and Alfonso Caso, however, Mayanists J. Eric Thompson and Sylvanus Morley argued for Classic-era dates for the Olmec artifacts. The question of Olmec chronology came to a head at a 1942 Tuxtla Gutierrez conference, where Alfonso Caso declared that the Olmecs were the &quot;mother culture&quot; (&quot;cultura madre&quot;) of Mesoamerica.

Shortly after the conference, radiocarbon dating proved the antiquity of the Olmec civilization, although the &quot;mother culture&quot; question generated considerable debate even 60 years later.

The Olmecs could have had direct influence on the societies around them. Olmec iconography and artwork uses imagery of animals such as the jaguar and the serpent, as well as large heads to depict their leaders. This same artwork and imagery can be seen in later civilizations&#x27; art and creations. Many Olmec artifacts have been found beyond their original territory. Despite the evidence, the hypothesis of a &quot;mother culture&quot; is uncertain as the diversity of cultures in Mesoamerica is great enough that the cultural strides made by the Olmec could have been made by other civilizations independently. In some cases, the motifs seen in Olmec archaeology might have been adopted from even earlier civilizations. Examples of these civilizations include the site of Zohapilco, the center for Tlatilco culture, the Zapotecs, and San Jose Mogote. Discoveries of older agriculture, writing, and ceramic creation show that cultures surrounding the Olmecs could have been more advanced, meaning that the Olmecs are not necessarily the &quot;mother culture&quot; that has been hypothesized.

At the site of Zohapilco, some of the oldest ceramics in Mesoamerica have been found dating back to almost 5,000 years ago. The area was known to have had a high population and was a clay-rich source for brickmaking. The ceramic figurines that have been found there represent pregnant women and could have influenced later Olmec civilization. Olmec art shows that they could have adopted very similar styles of art. These connections show the complexity of Mesoamerican culture through the discovery of more and more ceramics throughout the region. 

San Jose Mogote is another site that has elements of cultural strides that the Olmecs could have adopted as the site can be dated back to 1500-500 BCE. San Jose Mogote is a site that dates to the early Zapotecs, a civilization that situated well outside the Olmec heartland. The site shows some of the earlier signs of a working irrigation system by diverting water from streams over cropland. This irrigation system created by the Zapotecs existed well before the Olmecs existed as a society. The Olmecs also used various irrigation methods, but because of the difference in dating it is safe to infer that they most likely obtained some of these methods and ideas from the Zapotecs.
Despite evidence existing that at one time pointed in the direction that the Olmecs could have been a &quot;mother culture&quot; in Mesoamerica, these new discoveries largely refute that idea. The older evidence of the Zapotecs and other civilizations show that what was once considered Olmec technological and social evolutions were in fact much more widespread throughout the region before the Olmecs had even arrived at their strongest point. Mesoamerica is filled with many different civilizations that all contributed to the overall development of the region as time went on.

==DNA==
In the investigations of the San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán Archaeological Project at the sites of San Lorenzo and Loma del Zapote, several human burials from the Olmec period were found. The bone consistency in two of them allowed the study of their mitochondrial DNA to be carried out successfully, as part of an investigation that proposes the comparative analysis of the genetic information of the Olmecs with that obtained from subjects from other Mesoamerican societies under the advice of the specialists Dr. María de Lourdes Muñoz Moreno and Miguel Moreno Galeana, both at CINVESTAV in Mexico.

This pioneering study of mitochondrial DNA in 2018 was carried out on two Olmec individuals, one from San Lorenzo and the other from Loma del Zapote, resulted, in both cases, in the unequivocal presence of the distinctive mutations of the haplogroup A maternal lineage. They share the most abundant of the five mitochondrial haplogroups characteristic of the indigenous populations of the Americas: A, B, C, D and X.

==Alternative origin speculations==

Partly because the Olmecs developed the first Mesoamerican civilization, and partly because little is known of them compared to later Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Maya or Aztec, a number of Olmec alternative origin speculations have been put forth. Although several of these speculations, particularly the theory that the Olmecs were of African origin popularized by Ivan Van Sertima&#x27;s book &quot;They Came Before Columbus&quot;, have become well known within popular culture, they are not considered credible by the vast majority of Mesoamerican researchers and scientists, who discard them as pop-culture pseudo-science.

As of 2018, mitochondrial DNA studies carried out on Olmec remains, one from San Lorenzo and the other from Loma del Zapote, resulted, in both cases, in the “unequivocal presence of the distinctive mutations of the “A” maternal lineage. That is, the maternal ancestry of the Olmecs is not in Africa but in America, since they share the most abundant of the five mitochondrial haplogroups characteristic of the indigenous populations of the continent: A, B, C, D and X.

<text>The Magnavox Odyssey is the first commercial home video game console. The hardware was designed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates, while Magnavox completed development and released it in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box that connects to a television set, and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots and one line of varying height on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to display additional visual elements for each game, and one or two players for each game control their dots with the knobs and buttons on the controller by the rules given for the game. The console cannot generate audio or track scores. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia to accompany the games, while a peripheral controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.

The idea for a video game console was conceived by Baer in August 1966. Over the next three years he, along with Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch, created seven successive prototype consoles. The seventh, known as the Brown Box, was shown to several manufacturers before Magnavox agreed to produce it in January 1971. After releasing the console through their dealerships, Magnavox sold 69,000 units in its first calendar year and 350,000 by the time the console was discontinued in 1975. The console spawned the Odyssey series of dedicated consoles as well as the 1978 Magnavox Odyssey 2. One of the 28 games made for the system, a ping-pong game, was an inspiration for Atari&#x27;s successful 1972 &quot;Pong&quot; arcade game, in turn driving sales of the Odyssey. Patents by Baer and the other developers for the system and the games, including what was termed by a judge as &quot;the pioneering patent of the video game art&quot;, formed the basis of a series of lawsuits spanning 20 years, earning Sanders and Magnavox over  million. The release of the Odyssey marked the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles and was an early part of the rise of the commercial video game industry.

==Design==
The Odyssey consists of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The console connects to the television set through an included switch box, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel on channel three or four, which thereafter became the standard for game consoles. The controllers, designed to sit on a flat surface, contain one button marked Reset on the top of the controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button resets individual elements depending on the game, such as making a player&#x27;s dot visible after it is turned off. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included; an optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.

Internally, the Odyssey architecture is composed of digital computing parts. The circuitry is implemented in diode–transistor logic using discrete transistors and diodes. The games themselves do not use ROM cartridges like later consoles, but instead, use &quot;game cards&quot; composed of printed circuit boards that plug into the console. These cards modify the internal circuitry like a set of switches or jumpers, causing the Odyssey to display different components and react to inputs differently. Multiple games use the same cards, with different instructions given to the player to change the style of the game.
The Odyssey is capable of displaying three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts the speed of the computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, such as changing the center line of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game. The games include plastic overlays that stick to the television via static cling to create visuals. Games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.

In addition to the overlays, the Odyssey came with dice, poker chips, score sheets, play money, and card decks. One peripheral controller was released for the Odyssey, the first video game light gun. Named the Electronic Rifle, the rifle-shaped device registered a hit when pointed at a light source such as a dot on the television screen. Four shooting-based games were included with the light gun. The light guns were designed and manufactured by Nintendo, based on their 1970 Beam Gun toy.

==Development==
In 1951, while working for military contractor Loral Electronics, engineer Ralph H. Baer was assigned to build a television set; Baer later claimed that, while doing so, he had the idea to build something into a television set that the owner could control in addition to its normal function of receiving signals from a remote television station. Loral did not pursue the idea, but it returned to Baer in August 1966 while waiting for a bus. Baer, then the head of the Equipment Design Division at military contractor Sanders Associates, came up with the concept of using a television to play games, and the next morning wrote up a four-page proposal for a &quot;game box&quot; that would plug into a television screen, costing around . The proposed device would transmit a signal that the television set could tune into like a television channel, which Baer referred to as Channel LP, short for &quot;let&#x27;s play&quot;, and he described several games that could be played on it. While electronic computer games had been developed since the start of the 1950s, they were typically only found in large academic or research institutions, and in 1966 no commercial games or video game industry existed, or any form of video games for consumer television sets.

As a &quot;game box&quot; had little to do with the typical military contracts Sanders worked on, Baer picked an empty room and assigned one of his technicians, Bob Tremblay, to work on it with him rather than bring the idea to his bosses. By December 1966, they had completed an initial prototype later christened &quot;TV Game #1&quot;, which could display and move a vertical line on a television screen. Baer demonstrated the prototype to the Sanders director of research and development, Herbert Campman, who hesitantly agreed to fund it for for labor and for materials, making it an official project.

Baer spent the next few months designing further prototypes, and in February 1967, assigned technician Bill Harrison to begin building the project. Harrison spent the next few months in between other projects building out successive modifications to the prototype. Baer, meanwhile, brainstormed with engineer Bill Rusch on ideas for games for the console, resulting in a proposal for the basis of many games later created for the system. Harrison began developing some early games in May, beginning with a two-player game where the players repeatedly press a button in competition to fill or empty a bucket of water, and by June multiple games were completed for what was then a second prototype box. These included a game where players controlled dots chasing each other and a light gun shooter game with a plastic rifle. Baer demonstrated the new prototype to Campman, who enjoyed the shooting game, increased funding, and recommended Baer demonstrate the project to senior management. Baer demonstrated the console to the board, who were largely uninterested, though a couple of members were enthusiastic; nevertheless, CEO Royden Sanders authorized the project to be continued with the aim of selling or licensing the console as a commercial product.

By August 1967, Baer and Harrison completed a more focused prototype machine with fewer components, but found that to even come near to Baer&#x27;s initial price target of the console would require so much to be excluded that the resulting product would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming up with a way to display a third, console-controlled spot on the screen in addition to the previous two player-controlled ones, and proposing the development of a ping-pong game. By November, the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping-pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping-pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to sell the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.
The team first approached the cable television industry, and the prototype attracted the attention of TelePrompTer Corporation, who had seen it during a visit. After a few months of talks, cash-flow problems forced TelePrompTer to back out in April 1968. The same economic downturn that caused TelePrompTer&#x27;s problems caused financial difficulties at Sanders as well, which put the project on hold after the fifth prototype was developed while simultaneously undergoing large-scale layoffs. It was picked up again in September, this time without Rusch, and went through two more iterations resulting in January 1969 in the seventh prototype, known as the &quot;Brown Box&quot; due to the wood-grain stickers on the casing. With the system now largely complete, as the team began filing for patents they were unsure whom to approach to sell it until a Sanders patent attorney recommended contacting television manufacturers. Baer demonstrated the system to several companies, who all expressed enthusiasm; only RCA wanted to purchase the device, however, and an agreement could not be reached. Soon afterwards, though, RCA executive Bill Enders left RCA for Magnavox and convinced them to look at the console again. The creators of the Brown Box again demonstrated the device to Magnavox in July 1969; they received a tepid reaction from most of the executives, but Vice President of Magnavox Console Products Planning Gerry Martin was in favor, and Magnavox agreed to produce the console. After a long period of negotiations the two companies finally signed an agreement in January 1971.

A team from Magnavox led by George Kent turned the prototype console into a final product. They designed the exterior of the machine and re-engineered some of the internals with consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console&#x27;s circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns, and although integrated circuits were becoming common by 1972 Magnavox did not redesign the circuitry to use them. The games for the system were designed by Ron Bradford of Bradford/Cout Design and adman Steve Lehner, based largely on the ones developed by Baer, Harrison, and Rusch. The product planning for the console was initially overseen by Bob Wiles of the color television division, but was turned over to product manager Bob Fritsche as its own category of product in September 1971.

Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, &quot;Shooting Gallery&quot;, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, to go along with the plastic overlays for the games designed by Bradford that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to . Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox performed market surveys and playtests in Los Angeles and Grand Rapids, Michigan, and demonstrated it to dealers in Las Vegas in May 1972. The console was publicly unveiled at a press event at the Tavern on the Green in New York City on May 22, 1972. Magnavox announced the system&#x27;s launch date of September 1972, with availability restricted to dealers in 18 metropolitan areas, and demonstrated it for the next few months to Magnavox dealerships and media.

==Reception==
Magnavox began advertising the Odyssey in mid-September 1972, including an appearance on the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; on October 16, 1972. As the term &quot;video game&quot; was not yet in use, the company described the console as &quot;the new electronic game of the future&quot; and &quot;closed-circuit electronic playground&quot;. Magnavox initially ordered 50,000 units, but before release increased its production capabilities and built a larger inventory, as market testing found an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers, who handled their own advertising in their local markets; the company hoped that as the video game console was the first such product, consumers would visit its stores specifically for it.

There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972. Magnavox only sold 69,000 units. Baer believed that the low initial sales were due to the high price, and because Magnavox restricted sales to its dealerships and implied that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions. Other sources have stated that dealers may have misled customers to sell more televisions, though advertisements and in-store promotional videos explicitly stated that the Odyssey worked with &quot;any brand TV, black and white or color&quot;. Customers unfamiliar with the new device, seeing it was only sold at Magnavox dealerships, may have misunderstood its interoperability.

Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry said that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not the production run. After the initial holiday season Magnavox considered discontinuing the console, but the modest continuing demand, along with high customer satisfaction reports in surveys, convinced it to continue stocking the console. Magnavox published two catalogs each year, one before the Christmas season and another for its annual sale in January. The Odyssey did not appear in the pre-Christmas 1972 catalog, but the January 1973 catalog depicted the console in a two-page spread with pictures of bundled and optional games and the light gun. Fritsche&#x27;s team proposed the creation of alternate versions of the Odyssey, a &quot;lite&quot; version with five games and a version with four controllers and a dozen new or updated games. Baer proposed an add-on that would add sound to games, and a putting controller and associated golf game. Magnavox rejected the proposals, instead releasing four games for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Emry.

Although still only available at Magnavox dealers, national marketing for Odyssey began in late 1973. The company lowered the price to if purchased with a television. The console was released that year with different games in the United Kingdom. In late 1973, Magnavox ran a large advertising campaign for its 1974 products, including sponsoring Frank Sinatra&#x27;s November television special &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes Is Back&quot;. Commercials during the special and advertisements for it showed the Odyssey and other Magnavox products. Continuing demand led Magnavox to manufacture an additional 27,000 units for the 1973 holiday season, selling 20,000 of them according to Baer. It was released in 1974 in limited quantities in 11 other countries: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Soviet Union, Spain, Switzerland, and Venezuela. It was additionally released at some point in other countries, such as Mexico, where it was named the Magnavox Odisea, and clone versions were released by other manufacturers such as the Overkal in Spain, which may have been the first console produced in Europe. In 1974, Odyssey appeared in the Sears Wish Book. Magnavox sold 89,000 consoles in total in 1973, 129,000 Odyssey units in 1974, and 80,000 units in 1975. According to Baer the company sold 350,000 Odysseys in total worldwide, though Fritsche stated it reached 367,000. The light gun peripheral sold 20,000 units.

==Legacy==
Although there was continued customer demand for the console, Magnavox discontinued production of the Odyssey in the fall of 1975. Rising inflation had raised the manufacturing cost of the system to Magnavox from roughly to , and Magnavox was unable to raise the retail price to match. Instead, it sought a cheaper alternative; in May 1974 it signed a contract with Texas Instruments for integrated circuits to replace the transistors and diodes of the original system, and designed a limited version of the console around them. The result was the first of several dedicated consoles—consoles that could only play games built into the system—in the Magnavox Odyssey series, the Magnavox Odyssey 100 and Magnavox Odyssey 200, as part of the first generation of video game consoles; the Odyssey 100 was only capable of playing the ping-pong and hockey games from the original Odyssey, while the 200 also had the handball game and a rudimentary on-screen scoring system. The 100 and 200 were released in November 1975 to replace the Odyssey for and , respectively. Eleven dedicated Odyssey consoles were produced before a follow-up non-dedicated console in 1978, the Magnavox Odyssey 2.

While it showed the potential of video game consoles and was an early part of the rise of the commercial video game industry, the Odyssey is not generally considered a major commercial success. Magnavox produced no more games for the console after 1973 and rejected proposals for different versions of the console or accessories. While a few clone systems were produced in limited quantities, and multiple dedicated systems—generally focused on ping-pong game variants—were created by several companies, no other home video consoles capable of playing separately-produced games were released until the 1976 Fairchild Semiconductor Channel F.

Due to his work on the Odyssey, Baer has been referred to as the &quot;Father of Video Games&quot;. In 2004, Baer was awarded the National Medal of Technology for &quot;his groundbreaking and pioneering creation, development and commercialization of interactive video games, which spawned related uses, applications, and mega-industries in both the entertainment and education realms&quot;. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) added the Magnavox Odyssey to its permanent collection of video games in 2013. MoMA&#x27;s Paul Galloway described the console as &quot;a masterpiece of engineering and industrial design&quot; and stated that it was &quot;hard to overstate the importance of [Ralph Baer&#x27;s] place in the birth of the industry&quot;. The Brown Box prototype and the TV Game #1 prototype are located in Washington, D.C. at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History.

===Lawsuits===

In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief engineer Nolan Bushnell, designer of the first commercial arcade video game, &quot;Computer Space&quot;, saw a demonstration of the Odyssey. Inspired, when he and Ted Dabney quit Nutting to found Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping-pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey &quot;Table Tennis&quot; game. Alcorn soon developed &quot;Pong&quot; (1972), which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company&#x27;s first game. &quot;Pong&quot; was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer noted that customers bought the console because of &quot;Table Tennis&quot;, in turn because of &quot;Pong&quot;, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In April 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors, including Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and arcade distributor Empire, for infringing on its patents for video games played on a television screen. Two more lawsuits joined it by 1975, against Sears, Nutting, Williams Electronics, and others. Baer later stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a set of patents by Baer and the development team—particularly a pair which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, with one patent by Baer and one by Rusch.

The judge, John Grady, ruled in early 1977 that Baer&#x27;s patent for the Odyssey constituted &quot;the pioneering patent of the video game art&quot;, held the defendants&#x27; games as infringing, and set a precedent that any video game where a machine-controlled visual element hit and bounced off a player-controlled element violated Rusch&#x27;s patent. At the time of judgement, only Seeburg Corporation and Chicago Dynamic Industries—though bankrupt—remained out of the defendants of the initial three lawsuits, with all other companies having settled out of court. Atari&#x27;s settlement, made in June 1976, granted it a license in exchange for  million (equivalent to $ million) and access granted to Magnavox to all technology produced by Atari from June 1976 to June 1977; other defendants paid higher penalties. Over the next twenty years, Sanders and Magnavox sued several other companies over the issue, focusing on &quot;paddle-and-ball&quot; type games like &quot;Pong&quot; and &quot;Table Tennis&quot; that more clearly violated the patent; the final lawsuits ended in the mid-1990s. Defendants included Coleco, Mattel, Seeburg, and Activision; Sanders and Magnavox won or settled every lawsuit. Many of the defendants unsuccessfully attempted to claim that the patents only applied to the specific hardware implementations that Baer had used, or that they were invalidated by prior computer or electronic games. In 1985, Nintendo sued and tried to invalidate the patents, claiming as prior art the 1958 &quot;Tennis for Two&quot; game built by William Higinbotham. The court, however, ruled that the oscilloscope-based game did not use video signals and therefore did not qualify as a video game, and ruled again in favor of Magnavox and Sanders. Magnavox won more than  million in the various lawsuits and settlements involving the Odyssey related patents before they expired in the early 1990s.

==Games==
A total of 28 games distributed on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were included with the console—a set of 12 in America and a different set of 10 in other countries—with six others available for purchase either individually or in a bundle; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions. Another game, &quot;Percepts&quot;, was available for free to players that sent in a survey card. A light gun accessory, &quot;Shooting Gallery&quot;, was available for purchase, and included four games on two cards that used the rifle. A final four games were released for sale in 1973. The console does not enforce game rules or keep track of scores for the games; that is left up to the players.

<doc id="77266" wikidata="Q845804" url="?curid=77266" title="Modifier key">
<text>In computing, a modifier key is a special key (or combination) on a computer keyboard that temporarily modifies the normal action of another key when pressed together. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing; that is, pressing any of the , , or keys alone does not (generally) trigger any action from the computer. They are commonly used in defined sequences of keys with another keys to trigger a specific action. These sequences are called keyboard shortcuts.

For example, in most keyboard layouts the Shift key combination will produce a capital letter &quot;A&quot; instead of the default lower-case letter &quot;a&quot; (unless in Caps Lock or Shift lock mode). A combination of in Microsoft Windows will trigger the shortcut for closing the active window; in this instance, Alt is the modifier key. In contrast, pressing just or will probably do nothing unless assigned a specific function in a particular program (for example, activating input aids or the toolbar of the active window in Windows).

User interface expert Jef Raskin coined the term &quot;quasimode&quot; to describe the state a computer enters into when a modifier key is pressed.

== History ==
==Modifier keys on personal computers==
The most common are:
* (Control)
* (Alternate) – also labelled on Apple keyboards.
* (Alternate Graphic)
* – Meta key, found on MIT, Symbolics, and Sun Microsystems keyboards.
* – Hyper key, found on the Space-cadet keyboard
* – Super key, found on MIT, Symbolics, Linux, and BSD keyboards.
* (Windows logo) – found on Windows keyboards.
* – Command key, found on Apple keyboards. On older keyboards labelled (Apple logo).
* (Function) – often present on small-layout keyboards, or keyboard where the top row of function keys have multimedia functions like controlling volume attached.

The (Sun) Meta key, Windows key, (Apple) Cmd key, and the analogous &quot;Amiga key&quot; () on Amiga computers, are usually handled equivalently. Under the Linux operating system, the desktop environment KDE calls this key Meta, while GNOME calls this key, neutrally, Super. This could be considered confusing, since the original space-cadet keyboard and the X Window System recognize a &quot; modifier distinct from &quot;.

The ZX Spectrum has a Symbol Shift key in addition to Caps Shift. This was used to access additional punctuation and keywords.

The MSX computer keyboard, besides Shift and Control, also included two special modifier keys, Code and Graph. In some models, as in the Brazilian Gradiente Expert, the Code and Graph keys are labelled &quot; and &quot; (Left and Right Graphics). They are used to select special graphic symbols and extended characters.

Likewise, the Commodore 64 and other Commodore computers had the Commodore key at the bottom left of the keyboard.

Compact keyboards, such as those used in laptops, often have a Fn key to save space by combining two functions that are normally on separate keys. On laptops, pressing plus one of the function keys, e.g., F2, often control hardware functions. Keyboards that lack a dedicated numeric keypad may mimic its functionality by combining the Fn key with other keys.

The MIT space-cadet keyboard had additional Top and Front modifier keys. Combined with standard modifiers, it could enter as many as 8,000 different characters.

Specialist typesetting machines, and word processors such as the Redactron, sometimes used multiple modifier keys to trigger mode changes e.g. for emboldened text or justification changes. This approach gradually became obsolete after software based on commodity hardware and operating systems adopted the WIMP metaphor which provided drop-down menus etc.

===Accented characters===
Some non-English language keyboards have special keys to produce accented modifications of the standard Latin-letter keys. In fact, the standard British keyboard layout includes an accent key on the top-left corner to produce àèìòù, although this is a two step procedure, with the user pressing the accent key, releasing, then pressing the letter key. These kinds of keys are called dead keys. The AltGr modifier produces the áéíóú sequence, or in conjunction with the Shift key, ÁÉÍÓÚ. Keyboards of some languages simply include the accented characters on their own keys. Some keyboards also have a Compose key for typing accented and other special characters. By pressing , and then two other keys, something similar to a combination of the glyphs of the two previous keys will appear on the screen.

== Modifier Only ==
It is possible to use a modifier key as a normal key.

In 2005 Quicksilver (software) introduced a feature called &#x27;Modifier-only Activation&#x27;. If a modifier key (Command) was pressed for a short duration (under 300ms) then released with no other key being pressed, this was taken as a &#x27;trigger&#x27;.

In 2012 this kind of use of a Modifier key appeared in Apple&#x27;s &#x27;Dictation preferences&#x27; under OS X Mountain Lion, where Apple introduced options like &#x27;Press Right Command Key twice&#x27; to launch dictation.

This functionality was further increased in macOS Sequoia (2024) with the addition of modifier only keys to be used alone to activate shortcuts such as &#x27;Show Desktop, including Left Command, Left Option, Left Control, Left Shift, Right Command, Right Control, Right Option, Right Shift, fn. This effectively gives users 9 extra keys to activate shortcuts.

== Dual-role keys ==
It is also possible to use (with some utility software) one key both as a normal key and as a modifier.

For example, you can use the both as a normal Space bar and as a Shift. Intuitively, it will act as a standard Space when you want a whitespace, and a Shift when you want it to act as a shift. I.e. when you simply press and release it, it is the usual space, but when you press other keys, say , and , while holding down the , then they will be treated as plus X, Y and Z. 

The above example is known as &quot;SandS&quot;, standing for &quot;Space and Shift&quot; in Japan. But any number of any combinations are possible.

To press shift+space in the previous example, you need in addition to a space/shift dual role key, one of (a) another space/shift key, (b) a usual shift, or (c) a usual space key.

<doc id="77270" wikidata="Q325138" url="?curid=77270" title="Maurice Richard">
<text>Joseph Henri Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard ( , ; August 4, 1921 – May 27, 2000) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens. He was the first player in NHL history to score 50 goals in one season, accomplishing the feat in 50 games in 1944–45, and the first to reach 500 career goals.

Richard retired in 1960 as the National Hockey League&#x27;s all-time leader in goals with 544. He won the Hart Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player in 1947, played in 13 All-Star Games and was named to 14 post-season NHL All-Star teams, eight on the first team. In 2017, Richard was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history. His younger brother Henri also played his entire career with the Canadiens, the two as teammates for Maurice&#x27;s last five years. A centre nicknamed the &quot;Pocket Rocket&quot;, Henri is enshrined alongside Maurice in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Richard, Elmer Lach and Toe Blake formed the &quot;Punch line&quot;, a high-scoring forward line of the 1940s. Richard was a member of eight Stanley Cup championship teams, including a league record five straight between 1956 and 1960; he was the team&#x27;s captain for the last four. The Hall of Fame waived its five-year waiting period for eligibility and inducted Richard in 1961. In 1975 he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame. The Canadiens retired his number, 9, in 1960, and in 1999 donated the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy to the NHL, awarded annually to the league&#x27;s regular season leading goal-scorer.

The oldest of eight children, Richard emerged from a poverty-stricken family during the Great Depression and was initially viewed as a fragile player. A string of injuries prevented him from joining the Canadian military during the Second World War. Intense, he was renowned for his physical and occasionally violent style of play. Richard was involved in a vicious on-ice incident late in the 1954–55 season during which he struck a linesman. NHL President Clarence Campbell suspended him for the remainder of the season and playoffs, which precipitated the Richard Riot in Montreal. The riot has taken on a mythical quality in the decades since and is often viewed as a precursor to Quebec&#x27;s Quiet Revolution. Richard was a cultural icon among Quebec&#x27;s francophone population; his legend is a primary motif in Roch Carrier&#x27;s short story &quot;The Hockey Sweater&quot;, an emblematic work of Canadian culture.

In 1998, Richard was diagnosed with abdominal cancer and died from the disease two years later. He was the first non-politician to be honoured by the province of Quebec with a state funeral.

==Early life==
Joseph Henri Maurice Richard was born August 4, 1921, in Montreal, Quebec. His father, Onésime Richard, was originally from the Gaspé region of Quebec, before moving to Montreal, where he married Maurice&#x27;s mother, Alice Laramée. The couple settled in the neighbourhood of Nouveau-Bordeaux. Maurice was the oldest of eight children; he had three sisters: Georgette, Rollande and Marguerite; and four brothers: René, Jacques, Henri and Claude. Onésime was a carpenter by trade, and took a job with the Canadian Pacific Railway shortly after Maurice was born. The Richards struggled during the Great Depression; Onésime lost his job in 1930 and the family relied on government aid until he was re-hired by the railway around 1936.

Richard received his first pair of ice skates when he was four, and grew up skating on local rivers and a small backyard ice surface his father created. He did not play organized hockey until he was 14. Instead, Richard developed his skills playing shinny and &quot;hog&quot; – a game that required the puck carrier to keep the puck away from others for as long as possible. While he also played baseball and was a boxer, hockey was his passion. After he began playing in organized leagues, Richard joined several teams and used pseudonyms such as &quot;Maurice Rochon&quot; to circumvent rules that restricted players to one team. In one league, he led his team to three consecutive championships and scored 133 of his team&#x27;s 144 goals in the 1938–39 season.

At 16, Richard dropped out of school to work with his father as a machinist. He enrolled in a technical school, intent on earning a trade certificate. At 18, Richard joined the Verdun Juniors, though as a rookie he saw little ice time in the regular season. He scored four goals in ten regular season games, and added six goals in four playoff games as Verdun won the provincial championship. He was promoted to the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; affiliate in the Quebec Senior Hockey League in 1940, but suffered a broken ankle in his first game after crashing into the boards and missed the remainder of the season. The injury also aborted his hopes of joining the Canadian military: he was called to a recruitment centre in mid-1941, but was deemed unfit for combat.

Off the ice, Richard was a quiet, unassuming youth who spoke little. He met his future wife Lucille Norchet when he was seventeen, and she was thirteen. She was the younger sister of one of his teammates at Bordeaux, and her bright, outgoing personality complemented Richard&#x27;s reserved nature. Lucille proved adept at guiding him through trials and disappointments he experienced in both hockey and life. They were engaged when he was 20, and though her parents felt she was too young, married on September 12, 1942, when she was seventeen.

==Playing career==
===First Stanley Cup===

Having recovered from his broken ankle in time for the 1941–42 season, Richard returned to the QSHL Canadiens, with whom he played 31 games and recorded 17 points before he was again injured. He suffered a broken wrist after becoming entangled with a defenceman and crashed into the net. Richard rejoined the team for the playoffs. The skills he demonstrated in the QSHL, combined with the NHL parent club&#x27;s loss of players to the war and struggles to draw fans due to its poor record and a lack of francophone players, earned Richard a tryout with the Canadiens for the 1942–43 season. He signed a contract worth $3,500 for the year and, wearing sweater number 15, made his NHL debut with the team. Richard&#x27;s first goal was against the New York Rangers on November 8, 1942.

Injury again sidelined Richard as his rookie season ended after only 16 games when he suffered a broken leg. The string of broken bones so early in his career left observers wondering if Richard was too fragile to play at the highest levels. He made a second attempt to enlist with the military but was again turned down after x-rays revealed that his bones had not healed properly; Richard&#x27;s ankle was left permanently deformed, forcing him to alter his skating style. Humiliated by the rejection, he intensified his training and reported to Montreal&#x27;s training camp for the 1943–44 season fully healthy. The arrival of his daughter Huguette prompted Richard to change his uniform to number 9 to match her birth weight of nine pounds.

Remaining healthy throughout the season, Richard appeared in 46 of Montreal&#x27;s 50 games. He led the Canadiens with 32 goals and tallied 54 points, third-best in his team. His first full NHL season not only ended the criticism about his ability to play in the league, but established him as one of the best young players in the league. Coach Dick Irvin shifted him from left wing to right and put him on a forward line with Toe Blake and Elmer Lach. The trio, known as the &quot;Punch line&quot;, formed a dominant scoring unit throughout the 1940s. The Canadiens lost only six games after October, and went on to win the franchise&#x27;s first Stanley Cup championship in 13 years. Richard led the league with 12 playoff goals, including a five-goal effort against the Toronto Maple Leafs in a semi-final game. He tied Newsy Lalonde&#x27;s NHL record for goals in one playoff game (equalled by three players since), which resulted in his being named first, second and third star of the game, as chosen by journalist Charles Mayer. Richard was named a second team All-Star following the season. It was the first of 14 consecutive years he was named a league all-star.

===50 goals in 50 games===
The 1944–45 NHL season was a record-setting one for Richard. He first set a new mark for points in one game when he made five goals and three assists in a 9–1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings on December 28, 1944; his eight points broke the previous record of seven held by three players, and stood for 32 years until surpassed in 1976 by Darryl Sittler. Richard achieved the feat despite arriving for the game exhausted from moving into his new home that afternoon. He continued scoring at an unprecedented rate, and by February 1945 was approaching Joe Malone&#x27;s 27-year-old NHL record, set in 1918, of 44 goals in one season. Richard broke the record on February 25, 1945, in a 5–2 victory over Toronto. Malone was on hand to present Richard with the puck used to score the 45th goal.

As Richard approached 50 goals for the season, opposition players resorted to increasingly violent efforts to prevent him from scoring. He had to fight past slashes, hooks, and even players who draped themselves across his back. Richard went eight games without scoring and began Montreal&#x27;s final regular season game, March 18, on the road against the Boston Bruins with 49 goals. He finally reached the milestone by scoring with 2:15 remaining in the game, a 4–2 Montreal win. He became the first player to score 50 goals, a record that would stand until the 1960–61 season, when fellow Canadien, Bernie &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Geoffrion scored 50 goals in 64 regular season games . Richard&#x27;s mark was not surpassed until Bobby Hull scored 54 goals in 65 games while playing for the Chicago Blackhawks during the 1965–66 season. His mark of 50 goals in 50 games also became a standard that remains one of the most celebrated achievements in NHL history, unmatched until 36 years later when Mike Bossy did it in 1981 – the first of only four players to match Richard&#x27;s 50-in-50, in the more than 70 years since Richard set the mark. Richard finished the season with 73 points, seven behind Lach and six ahead of Blake, as the Punch line finished first, second and third in league scoring. Richard finished second in the voting for the Hart Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player, behind Lach.

Richard&#x27;s critics argued that his scoring record was the result of talent dilution brought about by the war; when many players returned in 1945–46, he won his second Stanley Cup with Montreal, but his goal output was nearly halved to 27. Richard again reached lofty scoring totals in 1946–47, leading the league with 45 goals in a 60-game season and winning the Hart Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player for the only time of his career. He finished second or third in the Hart Trophy voting a further five times in his career. Opponents continued their attempts to drive Richard to anger or frustration, as they had learned he could be goaded into taking himself out of the game by violently retaliating and fighting. One such incident occurred in the 1947 Stanley Cup Finals when Richard received a match penalty for striking Toronto&#x27;s Bill Ezinicki over the head with his stick in a game two loss. Richard was suspended for the third game of the series, which the Maple Leafs won.

As the reigning most valuable player, Richard sought a pay raise prior to the 1947–48 season. General manager Frank Selke refused, even after Richard and team captain Émile Bouchard both sat out the Canadiens&#x27; preseason before capitulating and returning to the team when the season began. The Punch line was broken up after Blake suffered a career-ending leg injury. Richard&#x27;s season also ended early as he missed the final games of the season due to a knee injury. He finished second in team scoring with 53 points in 53 games, but Montreal missed the playoffs. After recording only 38 points in 1948–49, Richard posted a 65-point campaign the next season and his 43 goals led the NHL for the third time. In 1950–51, Richard scored 42 goals, including his 271st career goal, making him Montreal&#x27;s all-time goal leader.
===All-time scoring leader===

Richard missed over 20 games of the 1951–52 season due to injury, but overcame another ailment in the playoffs. In the seventh and deciding game of the semi-final against Boston, Richard was checked by Leo Labine and briefly knocked unconscious after he fell and struck his head on Bill Quackenbush&#x27;s knee. Though dazed, Richard returned to the game late in the third period after a large cut above his eye was stitched up. Canadiens coach Dick Irvin sent Richard back onto the ice in the final minutes of the contest, despite knowing Richard had suffered a concussion. Richard scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory that sent Montreal to the 1952 Stanley Cup Finals. Following the game, a bloodied and still disoriented Richard was photographed shaking the hand of Boston goaltender Jim Henry, who was also showing symptoms of injuries from the series and who appeared to be bowing to Richard following the Montreal player&#x27;s &quot;unconscious goal&quot;. The photograph by Roger St. Jean is among the most famous images of Richard and one of the most iconic images in the league&#x27;s history. In the final, Montreal lost to Detroit in four straight games.

The 1952–53 season began with Richard in close pursuit of Nels Stewart&#x27;s all-time NHL record of 324 goals. Richard tied the record in Toronto on October 29, 1952, by scoring two goals against the Maple Leafs; his achievement earned a rousing ovation from Montreal&#x27;s rival fans. He failed to score in his following three games as frenzied fans followed each contest in anticipation of the record-breaking marker. In his fourth try, a November 8 game against Chicago, Richard scored his 325th goal at the 10:01 mark of the second period. According to the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, the ovation Richard received from his fans &quot;shook the rafters&quot; of the Montreal Forum. He finished the season with team-leading totals of 61 points and 28 goals – becoming the first player in NHL history to score at least 20 goals in his first ten full seasons. Aided by Richard&#x27;s 7 goals in 12 playoff games, the Canadiens defeated Boston in the 1953 Stanley Cup Finals to capture Montreal&#x27;s first Stanley Cup championship since 1946.

Richard led the league in goals for the fourth time in his career with 37 in 1953–54, then for a fifth time in 1954–55 with 38 (shared with Bernie Geoffrion). He scored his 400th career goal on December 18, 1954, against Chicago.

===Richard Riot===
Opposition players continued to try to stop Richard through physical intimidation, and he often retaliated with equal force. The situation led to a running feud with NHL President Clarence Campbell. Richard had been fined numerous times by Campbell for on-ice incidents and at one point was forced to post a $1,000 &quot;good-behaviour bond&quot; after he criticized Campbell in a weekly column he helped author for &quot;Samedi-Dimanche&quot;. Richard was among many in Quebec who believed that Campbell treated French Canadian players more harshly than their English counterparts. The simmering dispute erupted after an incident in the Canadiens&#x27; March 13, 1955, game against Boston, when Hal Laycoe struck Richard in the head with his stick. Richard retaliated by slashing viciously at Laycoe&#x27;s head, then punched linesman Cliff Thompson when the official attempted to intervene. Boston police attempted to arrest Richard for assault following the incident, but Montreal coaching staff and teammates refused police entry in protest.

Following two days of deliberation, Campbell announced that he had suspended Richard – who was leading the NHL&#x27;s overall scoring race at the time – for the remainder of the regular season and the playoffs. In English Canada, Campbell was praised for doing what he could to control the erratic Richard. Unknown to most at the time, Campbell had long wanted to impose a lengthy suspension on Richard over his previous outbursts. As NHL president however, Campbell ultimately answered to the league&#x27;s owners and they were reluctant to see such severe discipline imposed against one of the league&#x27;s star players on account of their value in increasing game attendance. In French Quebec the suspension was viewed as an injustice, an unfair punishment given to a Francophone hero by the Anglophone establishment. Richard&#x27;s supporters reacted angrily to Campbell: he received several death threats and, upon taking his customary seat at the next Canadiens game, unruly fans pelted him with vegetables, eggs and other debris. One fan threw a tear gas bomb at Campbell, which resulted in the Forum&#x27;s evacuation and the game&#x27;s forfeiture in Detroit&#x27;s favour. Fans fleeing the arena were met by a large group of demonstrators who had massed outside prior to the game&#x27;s start.

The mob of over 20,000 people developed into a riot. Windows and doors were smashed at the Forum and surrounding businesses. By the following morning, between 65 and 70 had been arrested. Over 50 stores were looted and 37 people injured. Damage was estimated at $100,000 ($ in dollars). Richard had also attended the game, but left immediately following the forfeit. Frank Selke attempted to persuade him to return to try to disperse the crowd, but Richard refused, fearing that he would instead further inflame the passions of the mob. He took to the radio the next day asking for calm: &quot;Do no more harm. Get behind the team in the playoffs. I will take my punishment and come back next year and help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.&quot;

The suspension cost Richard the Art Ross Trophy as the leading point scorer in the league, which he lost to teammate Geoffrion by one point. Richard never won the point title, finishing second five times in his career. Montreal fans booed Geoffrion when he surpassed Richard on the final day of the regular season. The fans continued to jeer Geoffrion into the following season. Montreal reached and lost the 1955 Stanley Cup Finals four games to three without Richard. The defeat was a bitter loss for Richard, who struggled to control his anger.

===Captain of a dynasty===
Richard fulfilled his promise to Canadiens&#x27; fans, made in his post-riot radio address, by leading Montreal to a Stanley Cup championship in 1955–56 – the start of a still unprecedented 5 consecutive Stanley Cup victories by one team. The season began with the arrival of his young brother and future fellow NHL Hall of Famer Henri, a centre given the nickname the &quot;Pocket Rocket&quot; to the Canadiens roster. It also marked the return of his former Punch line teammate, Toe Blake, as head coach. Along with general manager Frank Selke, Blake worked with Richard on moderating his temper and responding to the provocation of his opponents by scoring goals rather than engaging in fisticuffs. Richard finished the season with 38 goals and 71 points, second on the team in both respects to Jean Béliveau&#x27;s 47 goals and 88 points. Richard added 14 points in 10 playoff games as Montreal defeated Detroit to claim the Stanley Cup. He scored the second and ultimately Cup-clinching goal in the fifth and final game, a 3–1 victory.

Entering his 15th NHL season in 1956–57, Richard&#x27;s teammates named him captain of the Canadiens, succeeding Émile Bouchard, who had retired prior to the season. With 33 goals and 62 points, Richard again finished second on the team to Béliveau. In the playoffs, he scored the overtime-winning goal in the fifth game of the semi-final to eliminate New York, then scored four goals in a 5–1 victory over Boston in the first game of the finals en route to a five-game series win and second consecutive championship for Montreal.

Richard reached a major scoring milestone early in the 1957–58 season. During the first period of a 3–1 victory over Chicago on October 19, 1957, he became the first player in NHL history to score 500 goals in his career. As Richard celebrated with his teammates, it was announced to the Montreal Forum crowd: &quot;Canadiens&#x27; goal, scored by Mr. Hockey himself, Maurice Richard&quot;. He played only 28 regular season games that season, scoring 34 points, as he missed three months due to a severed Achilles tendon. Returning in time for the playoffs, Richard led Montreal with 11 goals and 15 points as the team won its third consecutive Stanley Cup. He scored the overtime-winning goal in the fifth game of the finals against Boston. It was the sixth playoff overtime-winning goal of his career, and the third during the finals, both NHL records.

At 37, Richard was the oldest player in the NHL in 1958–59. He scored 38 points in 42 games, but missed six weeks due to a broken ankle. Injuries again plagued Richard during the 1959–60 season as he missed a month due to a broken cheekbone. Montreal nonetheless won the Stanley Cup in both seasons. Richard scored no points in four games in the 1959 Stanley Cup Finals, but recorded a goal and three assists in 1960. The titles were the seventh and eighth of Richard&#x27;s career, and Montreal&#x27;s five consecutive championships remain a record. The 1956–60 Canadiens rank as one of eight dynasties recognized by the NHL.

The playoff goal was Richard&#x27;s last, as on September 15, 1960, he announced his retirement as a player. Richard had reported to Montreal&#x27;s training camp that autumn, but Selke compelled Richard to end his playing career, fearing he was risking serious injury. In Richard&#x27;s retirement speech, he said he had been contemplating leaving the game for two years, and stated that at age 39, the game had become too fast for him. Upon learning of Richard&#x27;s retirement, Gordie Howe offered praise for his former rival: &quot;He sure was a drawing card. He brought in the crowds that helped pay our wages. Richard certainly has been one of the greatest players in the game and we will miss him.&quot;

==Playing style==
Richard was nicknamed &quot;the Comet&quot; early in his career. When teammate Ray Getliffe remarked that Richard &quot;went in like a rocket&quot; as he approached the opposition goal, Richard was dubbed &quot;The Rocket&quot; by a local sportswriter; both Baz O&#x27;Meara from the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; and Dink Carroll of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; have been credited for the appellation. The nickname described Richard&#x27;s play in terms of speed, strength, and determination. Teammate and coach Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because &quot;when he would take off, nothing got in his way that could stop him&quot;. Goaltender Jacques Plante declared it one of the most appropriate nicknames given to an athlete, noting the fierce intensity that often showed in Richard&#x27;s eyes and comparing it to &quot;the rocket&#x27;s red glare&quot; referenced in &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. Glenn Hall agreed: &quot;What I remember most about Rocket was his eyes. When he came flying toward you with the puck on his stick, his eyes were all lit up, flashing and gleaming like a pinball machine. It was terrifying.&quot;

The prime of Richard&#x27;s career was the era immediately following the Second World War, where battle-hardened players returned to the NHL and implemented a &quot;gladiatorial&quot; style that featured rugged, physical and often violent play. Richard&#x27;s own temper was infamous, as illustrated by his actions that precipitated the Richard Riot.

A pure goal-scorer, Richard did not play with finesse, or was he known for his passing. One of his teammates remarked that &quot;Maurice wouldn&#x27;t even pass you the salt&quot;. Richard led the NHL in goals five times, but never in points. He was best known for dashing toward the net from the blue line and was equally adept at scoring from his forehand or backhand. His exploits revived a Montreal Canadiens franchise that had struggled to draw fans in the 1930s. In addition to his 14 appearances on post-season all-star teams (eight on the first team, six on the second), Richard played in 13 consecutive NHL All-Star Games between 1947 and 1959.

Richard was still an active player when Gordie Howe overtook his career record for points. Howe surpassed Richard&#x27;s career mark of 544 goals in 1963, while the latter&#x27;s record of 50 goals in one season stood for 20 years until broken by Bobby Hull in 1965. The Montreal Canadiens donated the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy to the NHL in 1999 as an award presented annually to the league&#x27;s leading goal scorer.

==Personal life==
Upon his retirement as a player, Selke offered Richard a job as a team ambassador and promised to pay him his full playing salary in the first year. After serving in the position for three years, Richard was named a vice-president of the Canadiens in 1964. He became disgruntled with a role he felt was powerless and only honorary, and resigned one year later. Richard grew estranged from the organization as his desire to be involved in the team&#x27;s operations was ignored, and the split deepened when the Canadiens forced Frank Selke to retire in 1965. He eventually refused to allow his name to be associated with the team.

As Richard struggled both with the need to find a purpose to his post-retirement life and the fear of being forgotten, he attached his name to numerous endeavours. He acted as a consulting editor for a magazine titled &quot;Maurice Richard&#x27;s Hockey Illustrated&quot;, owned the &quot;544 / 9 Tavern&quot; (named for his career goal total and sweater number) in Montreal, and was a pitchman for dozens of products, including beer, hair dye, car batteries, fishing tackle and children&#x27;s toys. He continued to use his name as a promotional vehicle for over 30 years after his retirement. Richard briefly returned to hockey in 1972 as head coach for the Quebec Nordiques of the World Hockey Association. He lasted only two games, a win and a loss, before finding himself unable to handle the strain of coaching. Richard reconciled with the Canadiens in 1981 and resumed his team ambassador role.

Richard and his wife, Lucille, lived in Montreal where they raised seven children: Huguette, Maurice Jr., Norman, André, Suzanne, Paulo and Jean. They had 14 grandchildren. Lucille died of cancer in 1994, two years after the Richards celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Richard&#x27;s companion late in his life was Sonia Raymond.

==Illness and death==

It was announced in 1998 that Richard was diagnosed with abdominal cancer. He died from the disease two years later on May 27, 2000 and was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. Prior to game 1 of the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals between the New Jersey Devils and Dallas Stars, there was a short tribute video highlighting the great moments and legacy of Richard&#x27;s career.

==Legacy==
Numerous honours were bestowed upon Richard throughout and following his career: the Canadian Press named him its male athlete of the year on three occasions, and in 1957, Richard won the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada&#x27;s athlete of the year. The Canadiens retired his sweater number 9 in 1960, while the Hockey Hall of Fame waived its five-year waiting period after retirement and inducted him in 1961. That same year, the 5,000-seat Maurice Richard Arena was built and named in his honour.

Upon the creation of the Order of Canada in 1967, Richard was named one of the inaugural members and, in 1998, was elevated to the rank of Companion of the Order of Canada. Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame honoured him in 1975, and Richard was given a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 1999. He was appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada in 1992.
While he was a popular player throughout Canada, Richard was an icon within Quebec. Author Roch Carrier explained the passion Richard elicited from the fans in his 1979 Canadian-classic short story &quot;The Hockey Sweater&quot;. Carrier wrote of how he and his friends all emulated Richard&#x27;s style and mannerisms: &quot;we were five Maurice Richards against five other Maurice Richards, throwing themselves on the puck. We were ten players all wearing the uniform of the Montreal Canadiens, all with the same burning enthusiasm. We all wore the famous number 9 on our backs.&quot; The story&#x27;s publication, and subsequent adaptation into a National Film Board animated short helped entrench Richard&#x27;s image as a pan-Canadian icon. Richard&#x27;s popularity persisted late into his life: when introduced as part of the ceremonies following the final hockey game at the Montreal Forum, Richard was brought to tears by Canadiens&#x27; fans, who acknowledged him with an 11-minute standing ovation. Upon his death, the province of Quebec honoured Richard with a state funeral, a first in Quebec for a non-politician. Over 115,000 people paid their respects by viewing his lying in state at the Molson Centre.

The Richard Riot has achieved a mythical place in Canadian folklore. The riot is commonly viewed as a violent manifestation of the discontent Francophones within Quebec held with their place in largely Anglophone Canada, and some historians consider the riot to be a precursor to the 1960s Quiet Revolution. In its 40th anniversary retrospective of the Riot, Montreal newspaper &quot;La Presse&quot; opened with the following passage: &quot;Forty years ago began one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of Quebec, and of hockey.&quot; Richard himself publicly dismissed his role as a catalyst for cultural or political change. In a 1975 interview, he said he played with &quot;English boys&quot; and was largely unaware of the situation in French Quebec at the time.

In an article published four days after the riot, journalist André Laurendeau was the first to suggest that it was a sign of growing nationalism in Quebec. Laurendeau suggested the riot &quot;betrayed what lay behind the apparent indifference and long-held passiveness of French Canadians&quot;. In contrast, in his book &quot;The Rocket: A Cultural History of Maurice Richard&quot;, Benoît Melançon disputes the importance of the riot, stating its perceived importance in history grew retroactively with Richard&#x27;s myth. Melançon wrote: &quot;According to this popular narrative, for the first time the people of Quebec stood up for themselves; especially English Canada delights in anachronistically announcing that this was the beginning of the 1960s Quiet Revolution.&quot;

Richard is the subject of the 2005 biopic &quot;The Rocket&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Admetus (; Ancient Greek: &quot;Admētos&quot; means &#x27;untamed, untameable&#x27;) was a king of Pherae in Thessaly.

== Biography ==
Admetus succeeded his father Pheres after whom the city was named. His mother was identified as Periclymene or Clymene. He was one of the Argonauts and took part in the Calydonian Boar hunt. Admetus&#x27; wife Alcestis offered to substitute her own death for his. The most famous of Admetus&#x27;s children was Eumelus, who led a contingent from Pherae to fight in the Trojan War. He also had a daughter Perimele.

==Mythology==
=== Divine herdsman ===
Admetus was famed for his hospitality and justice. When Apollo was sentenced to a year of servitude to a mortal as punishment for killing Delphyne, or as later tradition has it, the Cyclopes, the god was sent to Admetus&#x27; home to serve as his herdsman. Apollo in recompense for Admetus&#x27; treatment made all the cows bear twins while he served as his cowherd.

The romantic nature of their relationship was first described by Callimachus of Alexandria, who wrote that Apollo was &quot;fired with love&quot; for Admetus. Plutarch lists Admetus as one of Apollo&#x27;s lovers and says that Apollo served Admetus because he doted upon him. Latin poet Ovid in his Ars Amatoria said that even though he was a god, Apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of Admetus. Tibullus describes Apollo&#x27;s love to the king as &quot;servitium amoris&quot; (slavery of love) and asserts that Apollo became his servant not by force but by choice.

Apollo later helped Admetus win the hand of Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias, king of Iolcus. Alcestis had so many suitors that Pelias set an apparently impossible task to the suitors—to win the hand of Alcestis, they must yoke a boar and a lion to a chariot. Apollo harnessed the yoke with the animals and Admetus drove the chariot to Pelias, and thus married Alcestis.

Admetus, however, neglected to sacrifice to Artemis, Apollo&#x27;s sister. The offended goddess filled the bridal chamber with snakes and again, Apollo came to Admetus&#x27; aid. Apollo advised Admetus to sacrifice to Artemis, and the goddess removed the snakes.

=== Heroism of Alcestis ===

The greatest aid Apollo gave to Admetus was persuading the Fates to reprieve Admetus of his fated day of death. According to Aeschylus, Apollo made the Fates drunk, and the Fates agreed to reprieve Admetus if he could find someone to die in his place. Admetus initially believed that one of his aged parents such as his father Pheres would happily take their son&#x27;s place of death. When they were unwilling, Alcestis instead died for Admetus.

The scene of death is described in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Alcestis&quot;, where Thanatos, the god of death, takes Alcestis to the Underworld. As Alcestis descends, Admetus discovers that he actually does not want to live:

The situation was saved by Heracles, who rested at Pherae on his way towards the man-eating Mares of Diomedes. Heracles was greatly impressed by Admetus&#x27;s kind treatment of him as a guest, and when told of Admetus&#x27; situation, he entered Alcestis&#x27; tomb. He repaid the honor Admetus had done to him by wrestling with Thanatos until the god agreed to release Alcestis, then led her back into the mortal world. According to other accounts, Persephone, queen of the Underworld instead brought Alcestis back to the upper world.

<text>Alcestis (; Ancient Greek: Ἄλκηστις, &#x27;) orAlceste&quot;&#x27;, was a princess in Greek mythology, known for her love of her husband. Her life story was told by pseudo-Apollodorus in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, and a version of her death and return from the dead was also popularized in Euripides&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Alcestis&quot;.

== Family ==
Alcestis was the fairest among the daughters of Pelias, king of Iolcus, and either Anaxibia or Phylomache. She was sister to Acastus, Pisidice, Pelopia and Hippothoe. Alcestis was the wife of Admetus by whom she bore a son, Eumelus, a participant in the siege of Troy, and a daughter, Perimele.

== Mythology ==
Many suitors appeared before King Pelias and tried to woo Alcestis when she came of age to marry. It was declared by her father that she would marry the first man to yoke a lion and a boar (or a bear in some cases) to a chariot. King Admetus was able to do this because he was helped by Apollo, who had been banished from Olympus for one year to serve as a shepherd to Admetus. With Apollo&#x27;s help, Admetus completed the challenge set by King Pelias, and was allowed to marry Alcestis. But in a sacrifice after the wedding, Admetus forgot to make the required offering to Artemis, therefore when he opened the marriage chamber he found his bed full of coiled snakes. Admetus interpreted it a portent of an early death.

Apollo again helped the newlywed king, this time by making the Fates drunk, extracting from them a promise that if anyone would want to die instead of Admetus, they would allow it. And when the day of his death came near, no one volunteered, not even his elderly parents, but Alcestis came forward to die in place of her husband. As a token of his appreciation for Admetus&#x27; hospitality, Heracles rescued Alcestis from the underworld, shortly after fighting with Thanatos. After Alcestis comes back and is united with her husband, she doesn&#x27;t speak. Euripides in his work Alcestis asks, &quot;But why does she not speak?&quot;

== Appearance in other works ==

* Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s long poem, &quot;The Legend of Good Women&quot; features Alcestis as a character in both versions of the Prologue. In the poem, she is consort to the God of Love and instructs the poet-narrator to tell &quot;a glorious legend / Of Goode wymmen, maydenes and wyves / That weren trewe in lovyng al hire lyves.&quot;
*Milton&#x27;s famous sonnet, &quot;Methought I Saw My Late Espoused Saint&quot;, c. 1650, alludes to the myth, with the speaker of the poem dreaming of his dead wife being brought to him &quot;like Alcestis&quot;. 
* Lully wrote an opera, first performed in 1674, based on the story. 
* Händel wrote a 1750 masque, or semi-opera, based on this myth.
* Gluck in 1767 wrote a significant reform opera on the story. 
* Schweitzer composed an opera &quot;Alceste&quot; to a libretto by Wieland, premiered in 1773 in Weimar, as a milestone of German opera.
* In his poem &quot;Past Ruin&#x27;d Ilion&quot;, English writer and poet Walter Savage Landor (1775–1864) wrote the line &quot;Alcestis rises from the shades&quot; as having a double meaning, evoking her rise from Hades while demonstrating the ability of enduring poetry to give her vitality, drawing her into the light from the shadows of historical oblivion.
* Irish poet and playwright John Todhunter wrote a play called &quot;Alcestis: A Dramatic Poem&quot; that was published in 1879.

<text>Pelias ( ; Ancient Greek: Πελίας) was king of Iolcus in Greek mythology. He was the one who sent Jason on the quest for the Golden Fleece.

== Family ==
Pelias was the son of Tyro and Poseidon. His wife is recorded as either Anaxibia, daughter of Bias, or Phylomache, daughter of Amphion. He was the father of Acastus, Pisidice, Alcestis, Pelopia, Hippothoe, Amphinome, Evadne, Asteropeia, Antinoe and Medusa. These daughters are sometimes called collectively as &quot;Peliades&quot; after their father.

==Mythology==
===Early years===
Tyro was married to King Cretheus of Iolcus, with whom she had three sons, Aeson, Pherês, and Amythaon, but she loved Enipeus, a river god. She pursued Enipeus, who refused her advances. One day, Poseidon, filled with lust for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus and lay with her; from their union were born twin sons, Pelias and Neleus.

Tyro exposed her sons on a mountain to die, but they were found by a herdsman who raised them as his own, as one story goes, or they were raised by a maid. When they reached adulthood, Pelias and Neleus found Tyro and killed her stepmother Sidero for having mistreated her (Sidero hid in a temple dedicated to Hera but Pelias killed her anyway, causing Hera&#x27;s undying hatred of Pelias).

Pelias was power-hungry and he wished to gain dominion over all of Thessaly. To this end, he banished Neleus and Pherês, and locked Aeson in the dungeons in Iolcus (by the modern city of Volos). While in the dungeons, Aeson married and had several children, most famously, Jason. Aeson sent Jason away from Iolcus in fear that Pelias would have him killed as a potential heir to the throne.

Jason grew in the care of Chiron the centaur, on the slopes of Mount Pelion, to be educated while Pelias, fearing that he would be overthrown, was warned by an oracle to beware a man wearing one sandal.

===Quest for the Golden Fleece===
Many years later, Pelias offered a sacrifice by the sea in honor of Poseidon. Jason, who was summoned with many others to take part in the sacrifice, lost one of his sandals in the flooded river Anaurus while rushing to Iolcus. In Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid and Hyginus&#x27; Fabulae (13), Hera/Juno disguised herself as an old woman, whom Jason helped across the river when he lost his sandal.

When Jason entered Iolcus, he was announced as a man wearing one sandal. Fearful, Pelias asked Jason what he would do if confronted with the man who would be his downfall. Jason responded that he would send that man after the Golden Fleece. Pelias took Jason&#x27;s advice and sent him to retrieve the Golden Fleece. It would be found at Colchis, in a grove sacred to Ares, the god of war. Though the Golden Fleece simply hung on an oak tree, this was a seemingly impossible task, as an ever-watchful dragon guarded it.

Jason made preparations by commanding the shipwright Argus to build a ship large enough for fifty men, which he would eventually call the &quot;Argo&quot;. These heroes who would join his quest were known as the Argonauts. Upon their arrival, Jason requested the Golden Fleece from the king of Colchis, Aeëtes. Aeëtes demanded that Jason must first yoke a pair of fire-breathing bulls to a plough and sow dragon&#x27;s teeth into the earth. Medea, daughter of Aeëtes, fell in love with Jason, and being endowed with magical powers, aided him in his completion of the difficult task. She cast a spell to put the dragon to sleep, enabling Jason to obtain the Golden Fleece from the oak tree. Jason, Medea, and the Argonauts fled Colchis and began their journey home to Thessaly along with Medea&#x27;s brother Absyrtus.

===Death of Pelias===

During Jason&#x27;s absence, Pelias thought the &quot;Argo&quot; had sunk, and this was what he told Aeson and Promachus, who committed suicide by drinking poison. However, it is unknown but possible that the two were both killed directly by Pelias.

When Jason and Medea returned, Pelias still refused to give up his throne. Medea conspired to have Pelias&#x27; own daughters (the Peliades) kill him. She told them she could turn an old ram into a young ram by cutting up the old ram and boiling it. During the demonstration, a live, young ram jumped out of the pot. Excited, the girls cut their father into pieces and threw them into a pot, in the expectation that he would emerge rejuvenated. Pelias, of course, did not survive.

As he was now an accessory to a terrible crime, Jason was still not made king. Pelias&#x27; son Acastus later banished Jason and Medea, to Corinth, and so reclaimed the kingdom.

An alternate telling of the story has Medea slitting the throat of Jason&#x27;s father Aeson, who she then really &quot;does&quot; revive as a much younger man; Pelias&#x27; daughters then slit their father&#x27;s throat after she promises to do the same for him, and she merely breaks her word and leaves him dead.

<text>The Japanese robin (Larvivora akahige) is a small passerine bird in the family Muscicapidae. This species was formerly named &quot;Erithacus akahige&quot;, or &quot;Komadori&quot;. Its range extends from the south of the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands throughout Japan.

The name &quot;Japanese robin&quot; is also sometimes used for the red-billed leiothrix (&quot;Leiothrix lutea&quot;). The specific name &quot;akahige&quot; is, somewhat confusingly, the common name of its relative &quot;Larvivora komadori&quot; in Japanese. 

The Japanese robin, together with the Ryukyu robin and the European robin, was previously placed in the genus &quot;Erithacus&quot; . A 2006 molecular phylogenetic study found that the two east Asian species were more similar to the Siberian blue robin, at the time in &quot;Luscinia&quot;, than to the European robin. In 2010 a large study confirmed this result and also found that &quot;Luscinia&quot; was non-monophyletic. The genus &quot;Larvivora&quot; was therefore resurrected to accommodate a clade containing the Japanese robin, the Ryukyu robin, the Siberian blue robin and several other species that had previously been placed in &quot;Luscinia&quot;. 

== Description ==
The Japanese robin is about 14-15 centimeters in size. This bird species is mainly gray and bright orange. The male Japanese robin is olive brown from the top of the head to rump, with an orange face and neck, and a grey breast and underside. Their tail is reddish-brown, their legs are pinkish brown, and they have a black bill. The female Japanese robin looks very similar to the male, but their orange and brown color characteristics are much duller and less extensive. The juvenile Japanese robin also looks very similar to the adult, but has dark spotting on the breast, pale rufous feathers from crown to mantle, and a rufus buff.

== Habitat ==
The Japanese robin lives in natural habitats such as islands, lakes, mountains, and temperate forests. These habitats are abundant with species of small insects and plants that the Japanese robin eats. More specifically, this species lives in damp, dense, and shady areas such as undergrowth along valleys and streams. Many Japanese robins are located in broadleaf and deciduous forests throughout the Japanese islands of Honshu, Shikoku, Hokkaido and the Sakhalin Islands, and Yakushima, and during the winters in Southeast Asia.

=== Izu Islands ===
The population of Japanese robins on the Izu Islands in southeastern Japan are so geographically remote that they are usually considered a distinguishable subspecies, &quot;L. akahige tanensis&quot;, from the mainland populations, &quot;L. akahige akahige&quot;, based on phenotypic characteristics, such as feather colouration. Additionally, while the mainland Japanese robin usually inhabits deciduous and mixed coniferous forests in the summer, the Izu Islands subspecies migrates to lowland, warm-temperature forests instead. Due to the distance between the two populations, gene flow between the two subspecies is rare and inbreeding within the Izu Islands populations is relatively common.

== History ==
The Japanese robin is an abundant species of robin from the islands of Japan. The Japanese robin, along with the Ryukyu robin, can be traced back to 1835 when they were placed into one of the Coenraad Jacob Temminck&#x27;s works under the name &quot;Erithacus akahige&quot;. After the 2006 molecular phylogenetic study, the species was placed into a clade under &quot;Larvivora,&quot; meaning &quot;caterpillar eater,&quot; giving it half of its current scientific name.

== Diet ==
The Japanese robin, as hinted by its scientific name meaning &quot;caterpillar eater,&quot; is known for feeding on beetles, insects, milled worms, small crickets, fruits, and other small insects. Given their diet, they are considered omnivorous.

== Reproduction ==
The Japanese robin reproduces throughout May and June in central Japan. Their nest typically consists of moss, twigs, dry leaves, ferns, and roots. When the female is ready, she lays about 3-5 eggs of greenish color, one egg per day, and incubates them for roughly 2 weeks. Once born, the young chicks are nurtured for a month, or 31 days, before they leave the nest and become independent. The robin does not mate for life and only finds a partner during the spring mating season.

== Bird song ==
The Japanese robin can be considered a small songbird; however, it has a single note that is extremely loud at first, but tones down throughout the song. The robin&#x27;s call is similar to a telephone ring: well-spaced and simple phrases, along with short chattering. Females tend to sing during nest building and during the incubation period. Males will sing, but their frequency will drastically reduce once eggs have been laid.

<text>In Greek mythology, Adonis (; ) was the mortal lover of the goddesses Aphrodite and Persephone. He was considered to be the ideal of male beauty in classical antiquity.

The myth goes that Adonis was gored by a wild boar during a hunting trip and died in Aphrodite&#x27;s arms as she wept. His blood mingled with her tears and became the anemone flower. Aphrodite declared the Adonia festival to commemorate his tragic death, celebrated by women every year in midsummer. During this festival, Greek women would plant &quot;gardens of Adonis&quot;, small pots containing fast-growing plants, which they would set on top of their houses in the hot sun. The plants would sprout but soon wither and die. Then, the women would mourn the death of Adonis, tearing their clothes and beating their breasts in a public display of grief.
The Greeks considered Adonis&#x27;s cult to be of Near Eastern origin. Adonis&#x27;s name comes from a Canaanite word meaning &quot;lord&quot; and most modern scholars consider the story of Aphrodite and Adonis to be derived from a Levantine version of the earlier Mesopotamian myth of Inanna (Ishtar) and Dumuzid (Tammuz).

In late 19th and early 20th century scholarship of religion, Adonis was widely seen as a prime example of the archetypal dying-and-rising god. His name is often applied in modern times to handsome youths, of whom he is considered the archetype.

== Cult ==
=== Origin ===


The worship of Aphrodite and Adonis is probably a Greek continuation of the ancient Sumerian worship of Inanna and Dumuzid. The Greek name (&#x27;), ) is derived from the Canaanite word (&#x27;), meaning &quot;lord&quot;. 

This word is related to &quot;Adonai&quot; (), one of the titles used to refer to the God of the Hebrew Bible and still used in Judaism to the present day. The Syrian name for Adonis is &quot;Gauas&quot;.

The cult of Inanna and Dumuzid may have been introduced to the Kingdom of Judah during the reign of King Manasseh. Ezekiel 8 () mentions Adonis under his earlier East Semitic name Tammuz and describes a group of women mourning Tammuz&#x27;s death while sitting near the north gate of the Temple in Jerusalem.

The earliest known Greek reference to Adonis comes from a fragment of a poem by the poet Sappho of Lesbos (), in which a chorus of young girls asks Aphrodite what they can do to mourn Adonis&#x27; death. Aphrodite replies that they must beat their breasts and tear their tunics. The cult of Adonis has also been described as corresponding to the cult of the Phoenician god Baal. As Walter Burkert explains:

The exact date when the worship of Adonis became integrated into Greek culture is still disputed. Walter Burkert questions whether Adonis had not from the very beginning come to Greece along with Aphrodite. &quot;In Greece,&quot; Burkert concludes, &quot;the special function of the Adonis legend is as an opportunity for the unbridled expression of emotion in the strictly circumscribed life of women, in contrast to the rigid order of polis and family with the official women&#x27;s festivals in honour of Demeter.&quot; The significant influence of Near Eastern culture on early Greek religion in general, and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular, is now widely recognised as dating to a period of orientalisation during the eighth century BC, when archaic Greece was on the fringes of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

In Cyprus, the cult of Adonis gradually superseded that of Cinyras. W. Atallah suggests that the later Hellenistic myth of Adonis represents the conflation of two independent traditions.

=== Festival of Adonia ===


The worship of Adonis is associated with the festival of Adonia, which was celebrated by Greek women every year in midsummer. The festival, which was evidently already celebrated in Lesbos by Sappho&#x27;s time in the seventh century BC, seems to have first become popular in Athens in the mid-fifth century BC. At the start of the festival, the women would plant a &quot;garden of Adonis&quot;, a small garden planted inside a small basket or a shallow piece of broken pottery containing a variety of quick-growing plants, such as lettuce and fennel, or even quick-sprouting grains, such as wheat and barley. The women would then climb ladders to the roofs of their houses, where they would place the gardens out under the heat of the summer sun. The plants would sprout in the sunlight, but wither quickly in the heat. While they waited for the plants to first sprout and then wither, the women would burn incense to Adonis. Once the plants had withered, the women would mourn and lament loudly over the death of Adonis, tearing their clothes and beating their breasts in a public display of grief. The women would lay a statuette of Adonis out on a bier and then carry it to the sea along with all the withered plants as a funeral procession. The festival concluded with the women throwing the effigy of Adonis and the withered plants out to sea.

== Mythology ==
=== Birth ===
While Sappho does not describe the myth of Adonis, later sources flesh out the details. According to the retelling of the story found in the poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC – AD 17/18), Adonis was the son of Myrrha, who was cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father, King Cinyras of Cyprus, after Myrrha&#x27;s mother bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the goddess. It was to her nurse that, with much reluctance, Myrrha revealed her shameful passion. Sometime later, during a festival in honour of Demeter, the nurse found Cinyras half-passed out with wine and Myrrha&#x27;s mother nowhere near him. Thus, she spoke to him of a girl who truly loved him and desired to sleep with him, giving him a fictitious name and simply describing her as Myrrha&#x27;s age. Cinyras agreed, and the nurse was quick to bring Myrrha to him. Myrrha left her father&#x27;s room impregnated. After several couplings, Cinyras discovered his lover&#x27;s identity and drew his sword to kill her; driven out after becoming pregnant, Myrrha was changed into a myrrh tree but still gave birth to Adonis. According to classicist William F. Hansen, the story of how Adonis was conceived falls in line with the conventional ideas about sex and gender that were prevalent in the classical world, since the Greeks and Romans believed that women, such as Adonis&#x27;s mother Myrrha, were less capable of controlling their primal wants and passions than men.

=== Aphrodite and Persephone ===
Aphrodite found the baby, and took him to the underworld to be fostered by Persephone. She returned for him once he was grown and discovered him to be strikingly handsome. However, Persephone too found Adonis to be exceedingly handsome and wanted to keep Adonis for she too fell in love with him; Zeus settled the dispute by decreeing that Adonis would spend one third of the year with Aphrodite, one third with Persephone, and one third with whomever he chose. Adonis chose Aphrodite, and they remained constantly together. Another version states that both goddesses got to keep him for half the year each at the suggestion of the Muse Calliope. Thus was Adonis&#x27; life divided between Aphrodite and Persephone, one goddess who loved him beneath the earth, the other above it. In his comical work &quot;Dialogues of the Gods&quot;, the satirical author Lucian features Aphrodite in several dialogues, in one of which she complains to the moon goddess Selene that Eros made Persephone fall in love with Adonis and now she has to share him with her.

=== Death ===
Then, one day, while Adonis was out hunting, he was wounded by a wild boar and bled to death in Aphrodite&#x27;s arms. In different versions of the story, the boar was either sent by Ares, who was jealous that Aphrodite was spending so much time with Adonis, by Artemis, who wanted revenge against Aphrodite for having killed her devoted follower Hippolytus, or by Apollo, to punish Aphrodite for blinding his son Erymanthus. The story also provides an etiology for Aphrodite&#x27;s associations with certain flowers. Reportedly, as she mourned Adonis&#x27;s death, she caused anemones to grow wherever his blood fell, and declared a festival on the anniversary of his death. In one late account, his blood transformed into roses instead.

In a very different version from the standard, surviving in the works of fifth century AD grammarian Servius and perhaps originating from the island of Cyprus, Adonis was made to fall in love with a mortal girl named Erinoma by Aphrodite herself at the command of Hera. Erinoma, a virgin girl favoured by Artemis and Athena, rejected his advances, so Adonis crept up stealthily in her bedroom and raped her. Adonis then fled and went into a cave to hide from Zeus, who also loved Erinoma and would surely avenge the violence done against her. Hermes, however, lured him with a trick, as Ares wounded him mortally in the form of a boar. Adonis died, but was eventually restored to life after Aphrodite begged Zeus. Erinoma bore him a son named Taleus.

=== Other loves ===
Adonis was also said to have been loved by other gods such as Apollo, Heracles and Dionysus. He was described as androgynous, for he acted like a man in his affections for Aphrodite but as a woman for Apollo. &quot;Androgynous&quot; here means that Adonis took on a receptive role during sex with Apollo, which was interpreted in classical Greece to be the feminine position.

Heracles&#x27; love of Adonis is mentioned in passing by Ptolemy Hephaestion. The text states that due to his love of Adonis, Aphrodite taught Nessos the centaur the trap to ensnare him.

Another tradition states that Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and madness, carried off Adonis.

=== Other versions ===
In &quot;Idyll&quot; 15 by the early third-century BC Greek bucolic poet Theocritus, Adonis is described as still an adolescent with down on his cheeks at the time of his love affair with Aphrodite, in contrast to Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, in which he is portrayed as a fully mature man. Pseudo-Apollodorus (&quot;Bibliotheke&quot;, 3.182) describes Adonis as the son of Cinyras, of Paphos on Cyprus, and Metharme. According to Pseudo-Apollodorus&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheke&quot;, Hesiod, in an unknown work that does not survive, made of him the son of Phoenix and the otherwise unidentified Alphesiboea.

In one version of the story, Aphrodite injured herself on a thorn from a rose bush and the rose, which had previously been white, was stained red by her blood. In another version, an anemone flower grew on the spot where Adonis died, and a red rose where Aphrodite&#x27;s tears fell. The third century BC poet Euphorion of Chalcis remarked in his &quot;Hyacinth&quot; that &quot;Only Cocytus washed the wounds of Adonis&quot;. According to Lucian&#x27;s &quot;De Dea Syria&quot;, each year during the festival of Adonis, the Adonis River in Lebanon (now known as the Abraham River) ran red with blood.

== In post-classical literature culture ==
The medieval French poet Jean de Meun retells the story of Adonis in his additions to the &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot;, written around 1275. De Muen moralises the story, using it as an example of how men should heed the warnings of the women they love. In Pierre de Ronsard&#x27;s poem &quot;Adonis&quot; (1563), Venus laments that Adonis did not heed her warning, but ultimately blames herself for his death, declaring, &quot;In need my counsel failed you.&quot; In the same poem, however, Venus quickly finds another shepherd as her lover, representing the widespread medieval belief in the fickleness and mutability of women.

The story of Venus and Adonis from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; was tremendously influential during the Elizabethan era. In Edmund Spenser&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1590), tapestries depicting the story of Adonis decorate the walls of Castle Joyous. Later in the poem, Venus takes the character Amoretta to raise her in the &quot;Garden of Adonis&quot;. Ovid&#x27;s portrayal of Venus&#x27;s desperate love for Adonis became the inspiration for many literary portrayals in Elizabethan literature of both male and female courtship.

William Shakespeare&#x27;s erotic narrative poem &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; (1593), a retelling of the courtship of Aphrodite and Adonis from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, was the most popular of all his works published within his own lifetime. Six editions of it were published before Shakespeare&#x27;s death (more than any of his other works) and it enjoyed particularly strong popularity among young adults. In 1605, Richard Barnfield lauded it, declaring that the poem had placed Shakespeare&#x27;s name &quot;in fames immortall Booke&quot;. Despite this, the poem has received a mixed reception from modern critics. Samuel Taylor Coleridge defended it, but Samuel Butler complained that it bored him, and C. S. Lewis described an attempted reading of it as &quot;suffocating&quot;.

The story of Adonis was the inspiration for the Italian poet Giambattista Marino to write his mythological epic &quot;L&#x27;Adone&quot; (1623), which outsold Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;First Folio&quot;. Shakespeare&#x27;s homoerotic descriptions of Adonis&#x27;s masculine and Venus&#x27;s beauty inspired the French novelist and playwright Rachilde (Marguerite Vallette-Eymery) to write her erotic novel &quot;Monsieur Vénus&quot; (1884), about a noblewoman named Raoule de Vénérande who sexually pursues a young, effeminate man named Jacques who works in a flower shop. Jacques is ultimately shot and killed in a duel, thus following the model of Adonis&#x27;s tragic death.

=== As a dying and rising god ===
The late nineteenth-century Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer wrote extensively about Adonis in his monumental study of comparative religion, &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (the first edition of which was published in 1890) as well as in later works. Frazer claimed that Adonis was just one example of the archetype of a &quot;dying-and-rising god&quot; found throughout all cultures. In the mid-twentieth century, some scholars began to criticise the designation of &quot;dying-and-rising god&quot;, in some cases arguing that deities like Adonis, previously referred to as &quot;dying and rising&quot;, would be better termed separately as &quot;dying gods&quot; and &quot;disappearing gods&quot;, asserting that gods who &quot;died&quot; did not return, and those who returned never &quot;really&quot; died.

Biblical scholars Eddy and Boyd (2007) applied this rationale to Adonis based on the fact that his portion of the year spent in the Underworld with Persephone is not really a death and resurrection, but merely an instance of a living person staying in the Underworld. They further argued that Adonis is not explicitly described as rising from the dead in any extant Classical Greek writings, though the fact that such a belief existed is attested by authors in Late Antiquity. For example, Origen discusses Adonis, whom he associates with Tammuz, in his &quot;Selecta in Ezechielem&quot; ( &quot;Comments on Ezekiel&quot;), noting that &quot;they say that for a long time certain rites of initiation are conducted: first, that they weep for him, since he has died; second, that they rejoice for him because he has risen from the dead (&quot;apo nekrôn anastanti&quot;)&quot; (cf. J.-P. Migne, &quot;Patrologiae Cursus Completus: Series Graeca&quot;, 13:800).

Some other scholars have continued to cite Adonis/Tammuz as an example of a dying and rising god, suggesting that the descent into and return from the underworld is a functional analogue for death even if no physical cause of death is depicted.

<text>The Siberian rubythroat (Calliope calliope) is a small passerine bird first described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1776. It was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family, Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher of the family Muscicapidae. The Siberian rubythroat and similar small European species are often called chats.

It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in mixed coniferous forests with undergrowth in Siberia. It nests near the ground. It winters in Thailand, India, Indonesia and Bangladesh (See wintering range map). It is an extremely rare vagrant to Western Europe, having occurred on a very few occasions as far west as Britain. It is also an extremely rare vagrant to the Aleutian Islands, most notably on Attu Island.

This species is slightly larger than the European robin. It is plain brown above except for the distinctive black tail with red side patches. It has a strong white supercilium. The male has a red throat edged with a narrow black and then a broad white border. Females lack the brightly coloured throat and borders. The male has a song similar to a harder version of the garden warbler.

The Siberian rubythroat was previously placed in the genus &quot;Luscinia&quot;. A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that &quot;Luscinia&quot; was not monophyletic. The genus was therefore split and several species including the Siberian rubythroat as the type species were moved to the reinstated genus &quot;Calliope&quot;. Calliope, from classical Greek meaning &quot;beautiful-voiced&quot;, was one of the muses in Greek mythology and presided over eloquence and heroic poetry.

<doc id="77283" wikidata="Q129219" url="?curid=77283" title="Red-flanked bluetail">
<text>The red-flanked bluetail (Tarsiger cyanurus), also known as the orange-flanked bush-robin, is a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae. It, and related species, are often called chats.

==Habitat==
It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in mixed coniferous forests with undergrowth in northern Asia and northeastern Europe, from Finland east across Siberia to Kamchatka and south to Japan. It winters mainly in southeastern Asia, in the Indian Subcontinent, the Himalayas, Taiwan, and northern Indochina. The breeding range is slowly expanding westwards through Finland (where up to 500 pairs now breed), and it is a rare but increasing vagrant to Western Europe, mainly to Great Britain. There have also been a few records in North America, mostly in western Alaska as well as one on San Clemente Island off the southern California coast and one overwintering on the Central California coast in Santa Cruz, California, in 2023. One was also spotted in New Jersey in December 2023.

==Description==
At 13–14 cm long and 10–18 g weight, the red-flanked bluetail is similar in size and weight to the common redstart and slightly smaller (particularly with a slimmer build) than the European robin. As the name implies, both sexes have a blue tail and rump, and orange-red flanks; they also have a white throat and greyish-white underparts, and a small, thin black bill and slender black legs. The adult male additionally has dark blue upperparts, while females and immature males are plain brown above apart from the blue rump and tail, and have a dusky breasts. In behaviour, it is similar to a common redstart, frequently flicking its tail in the same manner, and regularly flying from a perch to catch insects in the air or on the ground. The male sings its melancholy trill from treetops. Its call is a typical chat &quot;tacc&quot; noise. The nest is built on or near the ground, with 3–5 eggs which are incubated by the female.

==Taxonomy and nomenclature==
The genus name &quot;Tarsiger&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;tarsos&quot;, &quot;flat of the foot&quot; and Latin &quot;gerere&quot;, &quot;to carry&quot;. The specific &quot;cyanurus&quot; is also derived from Greek, the roots being &quot;kuanos&quot;, &quot;dark-blue&quot;, and &quot;oura&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;.

In the past generally treated as comprising two subspecies, &quot;T. c. cyanurus&quot; breeding in northern Asia and &quot;T. c. rufilatus&quot; breeding in the Himalaya, it is now increasingly being treated as monotypic, with &quot;T. c. rufilatus&quot; split off as a distinct species, Himalayan bluetail &quot;T. rufilatus&quot;. The species has also been known by a variety of English and scientific names in the ornithological literature.

The subspecies &quot;albocoeruleus&quot;, distributed in north-central China, was described by Wilhelm Meise in 1937. It was usually considered invalid, until recognized by Hadoram Shirihai and Lars Svensson in 2018, and it is now proposed to be a full species, the Qilian bluetail (&quot;T. albocoeruleus&quot;), in a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2022. It is distinctive in genetics and vocalisation, but only marginally different in morphology. The males of &quot;albocoeruleus&quot; have bluer fore-supercilium, and less white than in &quot;cyanurus&quot;.

<text>The east coast akalat or Gunning&#x27;s robin (Sheppardia gunningi) is a small passerine bird which can be found in the east of Africa from Kenya to Mozambique, and is named after J. W. B. Gunning.

This species is a forest-dwelling insectivorous bird related to the small Old World flycatchers commonly known as chats; like these, it was formerly placed with the thrushes (Turdidae).

The east coast akalat is affected by habitat loss. Having turned out to be more common than previously believed, it is downlisted from Vulnerable to Near Threatened in the 2007 IUCN Red List.

<text>The Ryukyu robin (Larvivora komadori) is a bird endemic to the Ryūkyū Islands, of Japan. The Okinawa robin (&quot;Larvivora namiyei&quot;) previously was considered a subspecies.

The specific name &quot;komadori&quot; is, somewhat confusingly, the common name of its relative the Japanese robin in Japanese.

The Ryukyu robin, together with the Japanese robin and the European robin, was previously placed in the genus &quot;Erithacus&quot; . A 2006 molecular phylogenetic study found that the two east Asian species were more similar to the Siberian blue robin, at the time in &quot;Luscinia&quot;, than to the European robin. In 2010, a large study confirmed this result and also found that &quot;Luscinia&quot; was non-monophyletic. The genus &quot;Larvivora&quot; was therefore resurrected to accommodate a clade containing the Japanese robin, the Ryukyu robin, the Siberian blue robin and several other species that had previously been placed in &quot;Luscinia&quot;.

<doc id="77287" wikidata="Q206130" url="?curid=77287" title="Thrush nightingale">
<text>The thrush nightingale (Luscinia luscinia), also known as the sprosser, is a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae. It, and similar small European species, are often called chats.

It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in forests in Europe and the Palearctic and overwintering in Africa. The distribution is more northerly than the very closely related common nightingale, &quot;Luscinia megarhynchos&quot;, which it closely resembles in appearance. It nests near the ground in dense undergrowth.

The thrush nightingale is similar in size to the European robin. It is plain greyish-brown above and white and greyish-brown below. Its greyer tones, giving a cloudy appearance to the underside, and lack of the common nightingale&#x27;s obvious rufous tail side patches are the clearest plumage differences from that species. Sexes are similar. It has a similar but more powerful song than that of the nightingale.

==Taxonomy==
The thrush nightingale was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the wagtails in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla luscinia&quot;. Linnaeus specied the type location as &quot;Europae frondosis&quot; (leafy Europe) but this was restricted to Sweden by German orthithologist Ernst Hartert in 1910. The thrush nightingale is now one of the four species placed in the genus &quot;Luscinia&quot; that was introduced by the English naturalist Thomas Forster in 1817. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name and specific epithet are Latin for the common nightingale (&quot;Luscinia megarhynchos&quot;). The common name &quot;Nightingale&quot; is derived from &quot;night&quot;, and the Old English &quot;galan&quot;, &quot;to sing&quot;.

==Description==

An adult thrush nightingale is about long with a wingspan of approximately . The head, nape and the whole of the upper parts of the thrush nightingale are dark brown with a slight olive tinge. The colour is much deeper than that of the nightingale and is not at all rufous. The upper tail-coverts are less olivaceous and the tail feathers are dark rufous-brown. The lores and ear-coverts are brownish-black and the chin and throat are pale buff or whitish, mottled with brown, and are paler in colour than the nightingale. The sides of the throat are spotted brown and the pale feathers of the breast have brown central bands giving the breast a mottled appearance. The under tail-coverts are buff, sometimes barred or marked with brown. The wing feathers and wing-coverts are dark brown and less rufous than the nightingale. The beak, legs and feet are brown and the irises are dark brown. The sexes are similar to each other in appearance and the juveniles are darker and more mottled. There is a single moult in July and August at the end of the breeding season.

===Voice===

The male&#x27;s is loud, with a range of whistles, trills and clicks and includes a flute-like &quot;&quot;pioo&quot; with a pure bell-like tone. It is sometimes interrupted by a rasping &quot;dserr&quot; sound and is rather solemn as compared to that of the nightingale. The song does not have that bird&#x27;s loud whistling crescendo and is quite distinctive. It is also sometimes sung in the bird&#x27;s winter quarters. The call-note &quot;whit&quot;&quot; resembles that of the nightingale but is higher pitched and more abrupt.

==Distribution and habitat==
The thrush nightingale is a migrant species. It breeds in eastern Europe and the western part of temperate Asia. The northern limit of its summer range extends to Denmark, southern Finland, Norway and Sweden, the Baltic States, the Republic of Karelia, Kostroma, Vologda, Perm, Kazakhstan, Turkestan and Altai. The southern limit extends from Austria and the Czech Republic, through Romania, Bulgaria, southern Russia, Ukraine, the Crimea and northern Caucasus. It overwinters in Africa south of the Sahara. It is an occasional visitor to the British Isles.
In its breeding range, the thrush nightingale is found in damp deciduous woodland typically with alder and birch. It favours thick undergrowth with brambles, dense shrubs and tangled vegetation in swampy places and near water. In its winter quarters it is found in dense patches of thorn bush, especially in valley bottoms near water courses, and sometimes in thick vegetation at the edge of woodland.

The bird is a host of the acanthocephalan intestinal parasite &quot;Apororhynchus silesiacus&quot;.

==Behaviour==
===Food and feeding===
The thrush nightingale feeds chiefly on the ground taking earthworms, spiders and the adults, larvae and pupae of insects such as beetles, small moths, ants and flies. In the autumn, the berries of currants (&quot;Ribes&quot; spp.) and elders (&quot;Sambucus&quot; spp.) are also eaten. Before crossing the Sahara on its migration, thrush nightingales build up their fat reserves. It has been found experimentally that magnetic cues may stimulate the birds to do this. A simulation of the magnetic field found in northern Egypt encouraged birds preparing to migrate from Sweden to further build up their body fat.

===Breeding===
The thrush nightingale breeds in damp forests, nesting on the ground, often in the middle of a bed of stinging nettles (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;). The nest rests on a platform of dead leaves and is composed of dead grass stalks, bents (&quot;Agrostis&quot; spp.), sedges and stems, lined with finer material. It is built by the female which lays four or five (occasionally six) eggs. These are a milky-blue colour, usually plain but sometimes with a slight speckling of rusty-brown and measure an average of . The hen incubates the eggs which hatch in about thirteen days. The young are fed by both parents and fledge when about eleven days old, but are not fully independent for another twelve days or so.

==Status==
BirdLife International estimates that there are between 11 and 20 million thrush nightingales in Europe and that, as Europe forms somewhere between 50% and 74% of the bird&#x27;s global range, the total world population may be between 15 and 41 million individuals. In Europe, the population seems to be increasing slightly. The bird is considered to be of &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN.

<text>The common nightingale, rufous nightingale or simply nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos), is a small passerine bird which is best known for its powerful and beautiful song. It was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae. It belongs to a group of more terrestrial species, often called chats.

==Etymology==
&quot;Nightingale&quot; is derived from &quot;night&quot; and the Old English &quot;galan&quot;, &quot;to sing&quot;. The genus name &quot;Luscinia&quot; is Latin for &quot;nightingale&quot; and &quot;megarhynchos&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;megas&quot;, &quot;great&quot; and &quot;rhunkhos&quot; &quot;bill&quot;.

==Subspecies==

*Western nightingale (&quot;L. m. megarhynchos&quot;) – western Europe, North Africa and Asia Minor, wintering in tropical Africa
*Caucasian nightingale (&quot;L. m. africana&quot;) – the Caucasus and eastern Turkey to southwestern Iran and Iraq, wintering in East Africa
*Eastern nightingale (&quot;L. m. golzii&quot;) – the Aral Sea to Mongolia, wintering in coastal East Africa
==Description==
The common nightingale is slightly larger than the European robin, at length. It is plain brown above except for the reddish tail. It is buff to white below. The sexes are similar. The eastern subspecies (&quot;L. m. golzi&quot;) and the Caucasian subspecies (&quot;L. m. africana&quot;) have paler upper parts and a stronger face-pattern, including a pale supercilium. The song of the male nightingale has been described as one of the most beautiful sounds in nature, inspiring songs, fairy tales, opera, books, and a great deal of poetry. However, historically most people were not aware that female nightingales do not sing.
==Distribution and habitat==
It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in forest and scrub in Europe and the Palearctic, and wintering in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is not found naturally in the Americas. The distribution is more southerly than the very closely related thrush nightingale &quot;Luscinia luscinia&quot;. It nests on or near the ground in dense vegetation. Research in Germany found that favoured breeding habitat of nightingales was defined by a number of geographical factors.
* less than above mean sea level
* mean air temperature during the growing season above 
* more than 20 days/year on which temperatures exceed 
* annual precipitation less than 
* aridity index lower than 0.35
* no closed canopy
In the U.K., the bird is at the northern limit of its range which has contracted in recent years, placing it on the red list for conservation. Despite local efforts to safeguard its favoured coppice and scrub habitat, numbers fell by 53 percent between 1995 and 2008. A survey conducted by the British Trust for Ornithology in 2012 and 2013 recorded some 3,300 territories, with most of these clustered in a few counties in the southeast of England, notably Kent, Essex, Suffolk, and East and West Sussex.

By contrast, the European breeding population is estimated at between 3.2 and 7 million pairs, giving it green conservation status (least concern).

==Behaviour and ecology==
Common nightingales are so named because they frequently sing at night as well as during the day. The name has been used for more than 1,000 years, being highly recognisable even in its Old English form &quot;nihtegale&quot;, which means &quot;night songstress&quot;. Early writers assumed the female sang when it is in fact the male. The song is loud, with an impressive range of whistles, trills and gurgles. Its song is particularly noticeable at night because few other birds are singing. This is why its name includes &quot;night&quot; in several languages. Only unpaired males sing regularly at night, and nocturnal song probably serves to attract a mate. Singing at dawn, during the hour before sunrise, is assumed to be important in defending the bird&#x27;s territory. Nightingales sing even more loudly in urban or near-urban environments, in order to overcome the background noise. The most characteristic feature of the song is a loud whistling crescendo that is absent from the song of its close relative, the thrush nightingale (Luscinia luscinia). It has a frog-like alarm call.

The bird is a host of the acanthocephalan intestinal parasite &quot;Apororhynchus silesiacus&quot;.

==Cultural connotations==
The common nightingale is an important symbol for poets from a variety of ages, and has taken on a number of symbolic connotations. Homer evokes Aëdon the nightingale in &quot;Odyssey&quot;, suggesting the myth of Philomela and Procne (one of whom, depending on the myth&#x27;s version, is turned into a nightingale). This myth is the focus of Sophocles&#x27;s tragedy, &quot;Tereus&quot;, of which only fragments remain. Ovid, too, in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, includes the most popular version of this myth, imitated and altered by later poets, including Chrétien de Troyes, Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, and George Gascoigne. T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; also evokes the common nightingale&#x27;s song (and the myth of Philomela and Procne). Because of the violence associated with the myth, the nightingale&#x27;s song was long interpreted as a lament.

The common nightingale has also been used as a symbol of poets or their poetry. Poets chose the nightingale as a symbol because of its creative and seemingly spontaneous song. Aristophanes&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot; and Callimachus both evoke the bird&#x27;s song as a form of poetry. Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus to the “lament of the nightingale”.

In Sonnet 102 Shakespeare compares his love poetry to the song of the common nightingale (Philomel):

::&quot;Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
::When I was wont to greet it with my lays;
::As Philomel in summer&#x27;s front doth sing,
::And stops his pipe in growth of riper days:&quot;

During the Romantic era the bird&#x27;s symbolism changed once more: poets viewed the nightingale not only as a poet in his own right, but as “master of a superior art that could inspire the human poet”. For some romantic poets, the nightingale even began to take on qualities of the muse. The nightingale has a long history with symbolic associations ranging from &quot;creativity, the muse, nature&#x27;s purity, and, in Western spiritual tradition, virtue and goodness.&quot; Coleridge and Wordsworth saw the nightingale more as an instance of natural poetic creation: the nightingale became a voice of nature. John Keats&#x27; &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; pictures the nightingale as an idealized poet who has achieved the poetry that Keats longs to write. Invoking a similar conception of the nightingale, Shelley wrote in his “A Defence of Poetry&quot;:

::A poet is a nightingale who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician, who feel that they are moved and softened, yet know not whence or why.

The nightingale is the national bird of Ukraine. One legend tells how nightingales once only lived in India, when one nightingale visited Ukraine. Hearing sad songs from the people, the nightingale sang its song to cheer them up. The people responded with happy songs, and since then, nightingales have visited Ukraine every spring to hear Ukrainian songs. National poet Taras Shevchenko observed that &quot;even the memory of the nightingale&#x27;s song makes man happy.&quot;

The nightingale is the official national bird of Iran. In medieval Persian literature, the nightingale&#x27;s enjoyable song made it a symbol of the lover who is eloquent, passionate, and doomed to love in vain. In Persian poetry, the object of the nightingale&#x27;s affections is the rose, which embodies both the perfection of earthly beauty and the arrogance of that perfection.

==Cultural depictions==

* The &quot;Aēdōn&quot; (, &quot;Nightingale&quot;) is a minor character in Aristophanes&#x27;s 414 BC Attic comedy &quot;The Birds&quot;.
* Philomela is transformed into a nightingale, according to &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (book VI) of Ovid.
* The love of the nightingale (a conventional cultural substitution for the Persian bulbul) for the rose is widely used as a metaphor for the poet&#x27;s love for the beloved and the worshiper&#x27;s love for God in classical Persian, Urdu and Turkish poetry.
* &quot;The Owl and the Nightingale&quot; (12th or 13th century) is a Middle English poem about an argument between these two birds.
* &quot;When The Nightingale Sings&quot; is a Middle English love poem, extolling the beauty and lost love of an unknown maiden.
* &quot;Laüstic&quot;, a lai by French poet Marie de France from High Middle Ages (1100–1300) 
* John Milton&#x27;s sonnet &quot;To the Nightingale&quot; (1632–33) contrasts the symbolism of the nightingale as a bird for lovers, with the cuckoo as the bird that called when wives were unfaithful to (or &quot;cuckolded&quot;) their husbands.
* Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem&quot;, printed in 1798, disputes the traditional idea that nightingales are connected to the idea of melancholy.
* Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 6 (1808), the &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot;, includes in its second movement flute imitations of nightingale calls.
*A nightingale (called by its French name rossignol) features prominently in the French folk song À la claire fontaine
* Franz Liszt featured the nightingale&#x27;s song in the Mephisto Waltzes No. 1.
* John Keats&#x27;s &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; (1819) was described by Edmund Clarence Stedman as &quot;one of our shorter English lyrics that still seems to me ... the nearest to perfection, the one I would surrender last of all&quot; and by Algernon Charles Swinburne as &quot;one of the final masterpieces of human work in all time and for all ages&quot;.
* The beauty of the nightingale&#x27;s song is a theme in Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s story &quot;The Nightingale&quot; from 1843.
* A recording of nightingale song is included, as directed by the score, in &quot;The Pines of Janiculum&quot;, the third movement of Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s 1924 symphonic poem &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; (&quot;&quot;).
* Igor Stravinsky based his first opera, &quot;The Nightingale&quot; (1914), on the Hans Christian Andersen story and later prepared a symphonic poem, &quot;The Song of the Nightingale&quot; (1917), using music from the opera.
* In 1915, Joseph Lamb wrote a rag called &quot;Ragtime Nightingale&quot; that was intended to imitate the nightingale calls.
* &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; (1939) was one of the most popular songs in Britain during World War II. In 2004, the song was featured in an episode of series 2 of the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Peep Show&quot; and in 2019, it featured as the closing song of the Amazon/BBC miniseries &quot;Good Omens&quot;.
**Both Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;Good Omens&quot; and the aforementioned miniseries adaptation joke that &quot;while they were eating, for the first time ever, a nightingale (sang/actually did sing) in Berkeley Square. Nobody heard it over the noise of the traffic, but it was there, right enough.&quot;
* In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, nightingales are closely associated with the characters Lúthien Tinúviel and her mother, Melian.
* A nightingale is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 1 kuna coin, minted between 1993 and 2009.
*Nightingale was an inspiration of the creation of a Korean court solo dance Chunaengjeon (춘앵전). The dance initially was performed by a female dancer of the court of Joseon Dynasty, Mudong.
* In Chapter 13 of Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, the monster compares Safie&#x27;s singing voice to that of a &quot;nightingale in the woods&quot;.
*Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band&#x27;s sixth album, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Nightingales &amp; Bombers&quot;, took its title from a World War II naturalist&#x27;s recording of a nightingale singing in a garden as warplanes flew overhead. The recording is featured in a song on the album.
*The song of the nightingale is one of the main elements in the 2019 single &quot;Let Nature Sing&quot;.
*An operator in the mobile video game &quot;Arknights&quot; is named after it.

=== In the Baha&#x27;i Faith ===
The nightingale is used symbolically in the Baha&#x27;i Faith to represent the founder Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah. Baha&#x27;is utilise this metaphor to convey how Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah&#x27;s writings are of beautiful quality, much like how the nightingale&#x27;s singing is revered for its beautiful quality in Persian music and literature.

Nightingales are mentioned in much of Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah&#x27;s works, including the Tablet of Ahmad, The Seven Valleys, The Hidden Words, and the untranslated Tablet of the Nightingale and the Owl.

<doc id="77289" wikidata="Q26578" url="?curid=77289" title="Bluethroat">
<text>The bluethroat (Luscinia svecica) is a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now known to be an Old World flycatcher, in the family Muscicapidae. It, and similar small European species, are often called chats.

It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in wet birch wood or bushy swamp in Europe and across the Palearctic with a foothold in western Alaska. It nests in tussocks or low in dense bushes. It winters in the Iberian Peninsula, the northern half of Africa, and in southern Asia (among others including the Indian subcontinent).

The bluethroat is similar in size to the European robin at 13–14 cm. It is plain brown above except for the distinctive tail, brown with black outer corners and red basal side patches. It has a strong white supercilium. The males have a striking throat pattern, with a vivid glossy blue throat bordered below with (usually) a narrow black band (but see subspecies, below), and a broad brick-red band below that; additionally there is often a central spot, either red or white, in the middle of the blue throat; see subspecies below for details. Despite the distinctive appearance of the males, recent genetic studies show only limited variation between the forms, and confirm that this is a single species. Moult begins in July after breeding and is completed in 40–45 days, before the birds migrate.

The male has a varied and very imitative song. Its call is a typical chat &quot;chack&quot; noise.

==Taxonomy==
The bluethroat was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Motacilla svecica&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;Europae alpinis&quot; (Alpine Europe) but this was restricted to Sweden and Lapland by German orthithologist Ernst Hartert in 1910. The specific epithet &quot;svecica&quot; is Modern Latin meaning &quot;Swedish&quot;. The bluethroat is now one of four species placed in the genus &quot;Luscinia&quot; that was introduced in 1817 by the English naturalist Thomas Forster.

===Subspecies===

Eleven subspecies are currently accepted by IOC, but only seven by Shirihai. They differ in the extent and intensity of the blue on the throat in the males, whether the blue contains a central spot or not, and if it does, the colour of the spot; they also differ significantly in their breeding habitat and ecology.
*&quot;L. s. svecica&quot; (red-spotted bluethroat) – breeds in subarctic shrub tundra from Scandinavia east to western Alaska, winters in southern Asia in India, Pakistan, Middle East. Throat blue with a &quot;red&quot; spot.
*&quot;L. s. namnetum&quot; – breeds in lowland reedbeds in western France, winters SW Europe and NW Africa. Small, and short-winged; plumage as &quot;L. s. cyanecula&quot;.
*&quot;L. s. cyanecula&quot; (white-spotted bluethroat) – breeds in lowland reedbeds in central Europe from northern and eastern France northeast to the Baltic States, and southeast to Ukraine, winters in Africa. Throat blue with a &quot;white&quot; spot.
*&quot;L. s. azuricollis&quot; – breeds northern Spain. Throat blue with &quot;no&quot; spot or only a &quot;small white&quot; spot.
*&quot;L. s. volgae&quot; – breeds in lowland western Russia, winters in NE Africa and the Middle East. Intermediate between &quot;L. s. svecica&quot;, &quot;L. s. pallidogularis&quot;, and &quot;L. s. cyanecula&quot;, but usually with a red spot. Treated by Shirihai as a synonym of &quot;L. s. svecica&quot;.
*&quot;L. s. magna&quot; (syn. &quot;L. s. luristanica&quot; ) – breeds in mountains in eastern Turkey, the Caucasus, and northern Iran, winters in NE Africa and the Middle East. Throat blue with &quot;no&quot; spot, and no black band between the blue and the broad red band. The largest subspecies, also with a stronger bill.
*&quot;L. s. pallidogularis&quot; – breeds in lowland southeastern Russia and northern Kazakhstan east to the Tien Shan, winters in southern Asia. Much as &quot;L. s. svecica&quot; but blue slightly paler, and red spot often slightly paler rufous.
*&quot;L. s. abbotti&quot; – breeds Afghanistan to NW Himalaya, winters NW India. Dark, blue throat with a small red (or occasionally white) spot; bill long and slender.
*&quot;L. s. saturatior&quot; – breeds southern Siberia, northern Mongolia. Similar to &quot;L. s. svecica&quot;, and treated by Shirihai as a synonym of it.
*&quot;L. s. kobdensis&quot; – breeds western Mongolia, western China. Similar to &quot;L. s. pallidogularis&quot;, and treated by Shirihai as a synonym of it.
*&quot;L. s. przevalskii&quot; – breeds central China. Similar to &quot;L. s. pallidogularis&quot;, and treated by Shirihai as a synonym of it.

==Description==
The male plumage is brightest in spring and summer; after the summer moult, the fresh new feathers have pale tips which obscure the throat pattern. These tips then abrade in late winter and early spring to reveal the brigher bases of the feathers. Females of all subspecies usually have just a blackish crescent and very limited blue on an otherwise cream throat and breast, though older individuals can develop more strongly male-like plumage. They are not currently known to be distinguishable to subspecies on plumage, except for individuals with the most male-like plumage (females of the small &quot;L. s. namnetum&quot; and large &quot;L. s. magna&quot; can be identified on careful measurement). Newly fledged juveniles are freckled and spotted dark brown above and below for a few weeks after fledging, then moulting to first-winter plumage, in which both sexes resemble adult females (and like them, are not identifiable to subspecies).

==Distribution and habitat==
A disjunct population of &quot;L. s. svecica&quot; also breeds at high altitudes in the northern Carpathian Mountains in the Czech Republic, altitudinally and ecologically separated from &quot;L. s. cyanecula&quot; at low levels in the same area; these birds migrate to India in winter like other &quot;L. s. svecica&quot;, not to Africa as &quot;L. s. cyanecula&quot;.

<doc id="77297" wikidata="Q290922" url="?curid=77297" title="Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame">
<text>The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is an American history museum and hall of fame, located at 1000 Hall of Fame Avenue in Springfield, Massachusetts. It serves as basketball&#x27;s most complete library, in addition to promoting and preserving the history of basketball. Dedicated to Canadian-American physician James Naismith, who invented the sport in Springfield, the Hall of Fame inducted its first class in 1959, before opening its first facility on February 17, 1968.

, the Hall has formally inducted 436 players, coaches, referees, and other basketball professionals. The Boston Celtics have the most inductees, with 40.

==History of the Springfield building==
The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was established in 1959, without a physical location, by Lee Williams, a former athletic director at Colby College. In the 1960s, the Hall of Fame struggled to raise enough money to construct its first facility. However, the necessary amount was raised, and the building opened on February 17, 1968, less than a month after the National Basketball Association played its 18th All-Star Game. The Basketball Fame&#x27;s Board named four inductees in its first year. In addition to honoring those who contributed to basketball, the Hall of Fame sought to make contributions of its own. In 1979, the Hall of Fame sponsored the Tip-Off Classic, a pre-season college basketball exhibition. The Tip-Off Classic has been the start to the college basketball season ever since, and although it does not always take place in Springfield, Massachusetts, generally it returns every few years.

In the 17 years that the original Basketball Hall of Fame operated at Springfield College, it drew over 630,000 visitors. The popularity of the Basketball Hall of Fame necessitated a new facility, and on June 30, 1985, an $11.5 million facility was opened beside the Connecticut River in Springfield. As the new hall opened, it also recognized women for the first time, with inductees such as Senda Berenson Abbott, who first introduced basketball to women at Smith College. During the years following its construction, the Basketball Hall of Fame&#x27;s second facility drew far more visitors than anticipated, due in large part to the increasing popularity of the game but also to the scenic location beside the river and the second Hall&#x27;s interesting modern architecture.

In 2002, the Basketball Hall of Fame moved again—albeit merely 100 yards south along Springfield&#x27;s riverfront—into a $47 million facility designed by Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates. The building&#x27;s architecture features a metallic silver, basketball-shaped sphere flanked by two similarly symmetrical rhombuses. The dome is illuminated at night and features 80,000 square foot (7,400 m2), including a Subway sandwich shop, and an extensive gift shop. The second Basketball Hall of Fame was not torn down, but was converted into an LA Fitness health club. The Basketball Hall of Fame features Center Court, a full-sized basketball court on which visitors can play. Inside the building there are a game gallery, many interactive exhibits, several theaters, and an honor ring of inductees. A large theater for ceremonies seats up to 300. The honorees inducted in 2002, included the Harlem Globetrotters and Magic Johnson, a five-time NBA champion, three-time NBA finals MVP and Olympic gold medalist.

As of 2011, the Basketball Hall of Fame has greatly exceeded attendance expectations, with basketball fans traveling there from all over the world.

==Criteria for induction==
In contrast to the Soccer and the National Baseball Halls of Fame, Springfield honors international and American professionals, as well as American and international amateurs, making it arguably the most comprehensive Hall of Fame among major American sports. From 2011 to 2015, seven committees were, and as of 2016, six committees are employed to both screen and elect candidates. Four of the committees screen prospective candidates:
* North American Screening Committee (9 members)
* Women&#x27;s Screening Committee (7 members)
* International Screening Committee (7 members)
* Veterans Screening Committee (7 members), with &quot;Veterans&quot; defined as individuals whose careers ended at least 35 years before they are considered for election.

Since 2011, the Veterans and International Committees also vote to directly induct one candidate for each induction class.

Three committees were formed in 2011 to directly elect one candidate for each induction class:
* American Basketball Association Committee – This committee was permanently disbanded in 2015, because it had fulfilled its purpose over the previous five years.
* Contributor Direct Election Committee
** Other committees may choose to elect contributors. For example, the 2014 class included two contributors. 
* Early African-American Pioneers of the Game Committee

Individuals who receive at least seven votes from the North American Screening Committee or five votes from one of the other screening committees in a given year are eligible to advance to an Honors Committee, composed of 12 members plus rotating groups of 12 specialists (one group for female candidates, one group for international candidates, and one group for American and veterans candidates) who vote on each candidate. Each screening committee has a limited number of candidates it may submit to the Honors Committee—10 from the North American Committee, and two from each of the other committees. Any individual receiving at least 18 affirmative votes (75% of all votes cast) from the Honors Committee is approved for induction into the Hall of Fame. As long as the number of candidates receiving sufficient votes from a screening committee is not greater than the number of finalists that the committee is permitted to submit, advancement to the Honors Committee is generally pro forma, although the Hall&#x27;s Board of Trustees may remove from consideration any candidate who &quot;has damaged the integrity of the game of basketball&quot;. 

To be considered for induction by a screening committee, a player, retired coach, or referee must be fully retired from that role for at least three full seasons. The waiting period had originally been five years, but was changed to four years in December 2015, and to three seasons in December 2017. Prior to the induction class of 2018, referees had been eligible for induction after 25 years of full-time service, even if still active. Changes to the criteria for consideration of active coaches were also announced as part of the 2017 changes. Coaches become eligible upon 25 years of full-time service at the high school level or above, or three seasons after retirement. Effective with the class of 2020, active coaches must meet the years of service requirement and be at least 60 years old. No years of service criterion is required for those who have made a &quot;significant contribution to the game of basketball&quot;. Sportswriters and commentators can be elected as full-fledged members, in contrast to the Baseball Hall of Fame that places them in separate wings from the &quot;real&quot; Hall of Fame.

===Criticism===
Aspects of the Hall&#x27;s voting procedures, including voter anonymity, are controversial. While sportswriter voters of other major sports&#x27; Halls of Fame openly debate their choices, the Naismith Hall process is not transparent. The Hall has also been criticized for a tendency to enshrine active collegiate coaches and relatively obscure players while omitting some accomplished players and coaches.

The Hall has received backlash for excluding such players, coaches, and innovators. For example, the 24-second shot-clock had two developers for the National Basketball Association in Leo Ferris and Danny Biasone, but only the latter has been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Ferris was listed as an eligible nominee from 2017 to 2023. Tim Hardaway is one player noted as being snubbed from the Hall for a long time, possibly due to his past negative comments on the LGBT community despite support from peers involving his playing credentials; he was inducted in 2022. Nine of the ten NCAA Division I head coaches who won 800 games are currently in the Hall of Fame, with Cliff Ellis (894 wins) being the only exception. Leta Andrews, the all-time winningest coach in the United States (1,416 wins), has been a finalist five times but never inducted. Most notably, Eddie Sutton waited twelve years after his retirement to be inducted. Ken Anderson, holder of the third-highest winning percentage for all college basketball coaches in history, has not been inducted.

The Basketball Hall of Fame is very independent of its baseball and football counterparts, specifically for its induction and voting process. There are multiple different voting committees for the Basketball Hall: The International Committee, North American Committee, Women&#x27;s Committee, Contributor Direct Election Committee, Early African-American Pioneers Committee, and Veterans Committee. Each committee makes their own individual selections for their inductees into the Hall. The members of these committees serve three-year terms. How the members get selected, and who they are, is virtually unknown to the public and is kept completely anonymous. Inductees do not know who inducted them, and those who inducted them supposedly never let them know.

According to Mark Purdy, a sportswriter and selection committee member for the Baseball Hall of Fame, the Basketball Hall of Fame&#x27;s selection process is quite non-exclusive. He argues that the Baseball Hall of Fame first started inducting individuals in 1936, and Basketball did not start inducting players until 1959, but the Basketball Hall as of 2014 had more members than the Baseball Hall. Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame President and CEO, John Doleva, defends the exclusivity argument: &quot;I&#x27;m used to explaining it and it&#x27;s different than football and baseball,&quot; Doleva said. &quot;Because football and baseball cover the men&#x27;s game professionally, end of story. Naismith invented this game for everyone: men, women, high school, college, pro, coaches, players. We really represent the entire game, so we have a broader class&quot;.

==Inductees==
Since 1959, 436 coaches, players, referees, contributors, and teams have been inducted, with the most recent class entering on September 9, 2022. John Wooden, Lenny Wilkens, Bill Sharman, Tom Heinsohn, and Bill Russell have each been inducted as both player and coach (Wooden in 1960 and 1973, Sharman in 1976 and 2004, Wilkens in 1989, 1998 and 2010, Heinsohn in 1986 and 2015, and Russell in 1975 and 2021). John McLendon has been inducted as both coach and contributor, entering in 1979 as a contributor and 2016 as a coach.

On three occasions, the Hall has inducted new classes without honoring a player – 1965, 1968, and 2007.

==Other awards==
On November 14, 2023, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame created the inaugural Ice Cube Impact Award and he was awarded it January 15, 2024.

In conjunction with the Final Four of each year&#x27;s NCAA Division I men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournaments, the Naismith Hall gives out several awards to college basketball athletes:

For men, the Hall presents awards to the top players in Division I at each of the five standard basketball positions.
* The Bob Cousy Award, presented since 2004 to the top point guard. The award was originally open to players in all three NCAA divisions (I, II, and III), but then restricted to D-I players.
* The Jerry West Award, presented since 2015 to the top shooting guard.
* The Julius Erving Award, presented since 2015 to the top small forward.
* The Karl Malone Award, presented since 2015 to the top power forward.
* The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award, presented since 2015 to the top center.

Each of the award winners is chosen by a Hall of Fame selection committee, plus the award&#x27;s namesake.

The Hall, in cooperation with the Women&#x27;s Basketball Coaches Association, presents analogous awards for the top Division I women&#x27;s players at each position. One has been awarded since 2000; the others were first presented in 2018.
* The Nancy Lieberman Award for the top point guard was the Hall&#x27;s only women&#x27;s positional award that was presented before 2018, having first been awarded in 2000.
* The Ann Meyers Drysdale Award, first presented in 2018 to the top shooting guard.
* The Cheryl Miller Award, first presented in 2018 to the top small forward.
* The Katrina McClain Award, first presented in 2018 to the top power forward.
* The Lisa Leslie Award, first presented in 2018 to the top center.

As with the men&#x27;s awards, the selection committee for the women&#x27;s awards includes each award&#x27;s namesake.

The Hall also formerly presented the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award to two college seniors—one male player no taller than , and one female player no taller than —determined to have been the nation&#x27;s best student-athletes. The men&#x27;s award, given since 1969, was voted on by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and the women&#x27;s, given since 1984, by members of the Women&#x27;s Basketball Coaches Association. Both awards were discontinued after the 2012–13 season.

<doc id="77298" wikidata="Q4116200" url="?curid=77298" title="Practice of law">
<text>In its most general sense, the practice of law involves giving legal advice to clients, drafting legal documents for clients, and representing clients in legal negotiations and court proceedings such as lawsuits, and is applied to the professional services of a lawyer or attorney at law, barrister, solicitor, or civil law notary. However, there is a substantial amount of overlap between the practice of law and various other professions where clients are represented by agents. These professions include real estate, banking, accounting, and insurance. Moreover, a growing number of legal document assistants (LDAs) are offering services which have traditionally been offered only by lawyers and their employee paralegals. Many documents may now be created by computer-assisted drafting libraries, where the clients are asked a series of questions that are posed by the software in order to construct the legal documents. In addition, regulatory consulting firms also provide advisory services on regulatory compliance that were traditionally provided exclusively by law firms.

==United States==
In the United States, the practice of law is conditioned upon admission to practice of law, and specifically admission to the bar of a particular state or other territorial jurisdiction. The American Bar Association and the American Law Institute are among the organizations that are concerned with the interests of lawyers as a profession and the promulgation of uniform standards of professionalism and ethics, but regulation of the practice of law is left to the individual states, and their definitions vary.

===Unauthorized practice of law===

&quot;Unauthorized practice of law&quot; (UPL) is an act sometimes prohibited by statute, regulation, or court rules.

====Definition====
The definition of &quot;unauthorized practice of law&quot; is variable, and is often conclusory and tautological, &quot;i.e.&quot;, it is the doing of a lawyer&#x27;s or counselor&#x27;s work by a non-lawyer for money. There is some agreement that appearing in a legally constituted court in a legal proceeding to represent clients (particularly for a fee) is considered to be unauthorized practice of law. But other variations are subject to interpretation and conflicting regulation, particularly as to the scope and breadth of the prohibition. &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; defines unauthorized practice of law as &quot;The practice of law by a person, typically a nonlawyer, who has not been licensed or admitted to practice law in a given jurisdiction.&quot;

The Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers notes:

The definitions and tests employed by courts to delineate unauthorized practice by non-lawyers have been vague or conclusory, while jurisdictions have differed significantly in describing what constitutes unauthorized practice in particular areas.

Certain activities, such as the representation of another person in litigation, are generally proscribed. Even in that area, many jurisdictions recognize exceptions for such matters as small-claims and landlord-tenant tribunals and certain proceedings in administrative agencies. Moreover, many jurisdictions have authorized law students and others not locally admitted to represent indigent persons or others as part of clinical legal education programs. ...

What is more controversial is out-of-court activities, particularly drafting of documents and giving advice, and whether that is considered to be unauthorized practice of law. Some states have defined the &quot;practice of law&quot; to include those who appear as a representative in arbitration or act as arbitrators in disputes. For example, there is a growing conflict between the multijurisdictional practice of law in arbitration proceedings in the financial service industry and state regulation of lawyers. With a few exceptions, the general rule is that an appearance at an arbitration does not constitute the practice of law.

The United States bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of Tennessee has held that &quot;providing clients with explanations or definitions of such legal terms of art ... is, by itself, giving legal advice.&quot; The North Carolina State Bar has held that &quot;definition of lien law terms, warnings regarding time requirements, and reminders about sending out preliminary notices within five to ten days of beginning work, when combined with its preparation of legal documents [in the manner described], constitute providing legal advice.&quot;

Texas law generally prohibits a person who is not an attorney from representing a client in a personal injury or property damage matter, and punishes a violation as a misdemeanor. Some states also criminalize the separate behavior of falsely claiming to be lawyer (in Texas, for example, this is a felony if done to obtain economic benefit).

====Enforcement====
Criminal laws and enforcement of &quot;Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)&quot; statutes is the organized bar&#x27;s preferred method. In Florida, the unauthorized practice of law is a third degree felony, which is punishable by up to six months in prison and $5000 in fines. New Jersey has a law which makes it a &quot;disorderly persons offense&quot; to knowingly to engage in the unauthorized practice of law, and a &quot;crime in the fourth degree&quot; to commit UPL if one (a) creates a false impression that one is a lawyer; (b) derives a benefit from UPL, or (c) causes an injury by UPL. In a 2015 survey by the American Bar Association, Florida had the largest budget—$1.8 million—nationwide for prosecuting the unauthorized practice of law.

The state has interest in protecting the public from having unqualified persons hold themselves out as licensed professionals, but the existence of laws against unauthorized practice of itself does not guarantee that unlicensed professionals will be detected and those laws enforced.

====History and future====
The American Bar Association proposed model rules regarding the unauthorized practice of law, which Judge Richard Posner characterized as an attempt to perpetuate a monopoly to the disadvantage of consumers. The judge observed that the legal profession is &quot;a cartel of providers of services relating to society&#x27;s laws&quot; which cartel&#x27;s focus is to restrict entry. &quot;Modern economists call it &#x27;rent seeking&#x27;, but throughout recorded history, skilled crafts and professions have tried to raise their members&#x27; incomes by using the power of the state to limit entry.&quot;

The practice of law was not formally regulated in Arizona for a time. However, the Arizona Supreme Court found independent inherent authority to regulate the practice of law. Arizona&#x27;s statute criminalizing unauthorized practice of law was allowed to lapse from a sunset law in 1985. Rose suggests that legislative proposals to recriminalize the unauthorized practice of law have heretofore failed because of anti-lawyer sentiment in Arizona politics. Moreover, Rose asserts that resentment lingers from an unpopular interpretation of the old statute in &quot;State Bar v. Arizona Land Title &amp; Trust Co.&quot;, 90 Ariz. 76 (1961). This ruling imposed sanctions on a title and realty company engaged in drafting contracts. Rose says, &quot;Throughout the country, various jurisdictions have developed numerous tests for defining the practice of law. But none is broader nor more all-encompassing than that articulated in &quot;Arizona Title&quot;.&quot;

====Attorney participation====
In the United States, the rules of professional conduct generally prohibit an attorney from assisting a non-attorney from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. An attorney therefore may not partner with or split fees with a non-attorney in the performance of any sort of legal work. Furthermore, an attorney may not employ a disbarred or suspended attorney in a legal practice where former clients of the disbarred or suspended attorney will be represented. 

==Singapore==

=== Unauthorized practice of law ===
In Singapore, it is a criminal offence if an unauthorised person pretends to be a qualified lawyer or carries out any act that may be performed only by a qualified lawyer. The relevant provision is section 33 of the Legal Profession Act. The acts that may be performed only by a qualified lawyer are set out in section 33 of the Legal Profession Act and case law.

<doc id="77304" wikidata="Q180274" url="?curid=77304" title="Chartres Cathedral">
<text>Chartres Cathedral, (, lit., Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres), is a Catholic cathedral in Chartres, France, about southwest of Paris, and is the seat of the Bishop of Chartres. Dedicated in honour of the Virgin Mary (&#x27;Our Lady&#x27;), it was mostly constructed between 1194 and 1220, it stands on the site of at least five cathedrals that have occupied the site since the Diocese of Chartres was formed as an episcopal see in the 4th century. It is one of the best-known and most influential examples of High Gothic and Classic Gothic architecture.
It was built above earlier Romanesque basements, while its north spire is more recent (1507–1513) and is built in the more ornate Flamboyant style.

&quot;[O]ne of the most beautiful and historically significant cathedrals in all of Europe,&quot; it was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979, which called it &quot;the high point of French Gothic art&quot; and a &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

The cathedral has been well-preserved and restored: the majority of the original stained glass windows survive intact, while the architecture has seen only minor changes since the early 13th century. The building&#x27;s exterior is dominated by heavy flying buttresses which allowed the architects to increase the window size significantly, while the west end is dominated by two contrasting spires – a 105-metre (349 ft) plain pyramid completed around 1160 and the 113-metre (377 ft) Flamboyant (late Gothic) spire on top of an older tower. Its three great façades are adorned with hundreds of sculpted figures illustrating key theological themes and narratives.

Since at least the 12th century the cathedral has been an important destination for travellers. It attracts large numbers of Christian pilgrims, many of whom come to venerate its famous relic, the &quot;Sancta Camisa&quot;, said to be the tunic worn by the Virgin Mary at Christ&#x27;s birth, as well as large numbers of secular tourists who come to admire the cathedral&#x27;s architecture and art. A venerated Black Madonna statue enshrined within was crowned by Pope Pius IX on 31 May 1855.

==History==
===Earlier Cathedrals===

At least five cathedrals have stood on this site, each replacing an earlier building damaged by war or fire. The first church dated from no later than the 4th century and was located at the base of a Gallo-Roman wall; this was put to the torch in 743 on the orders of the Duke of Aquitaine. The second church on the site was set on fire by Danish pirates in 858. This was then reconstructed and enlarged by Bishop Gislebert, but was itself destroyed by fire in 1020. A vestige of this church, now known as Saint Lubin Chapel, remains, underneath the apse of the present cathedral. It took its name from Lubinus, the mid-6th-century Bishop of Chartres. It is lower than the rest of the crypt and may have been the shrine of a local saint, prior to the church&#x27;s rededication to the Virgin Mary.

In 962, the church was damaged by another fire and was reconstructed yet again. A more serious fire broke out on 7 September 1020, after which Bishop Fulbert (bishop from 1006 to 1028) decided to build a new cathedral. He appealed to the royal houses of Europe, and received generous donations for the rebuilding, including a gift from Cnut the Great, King of Norway, Denmark and much of England. The new cathedral was constructed atop and around the remains of the 9th-century church. It consisted of an ambulatory around the earlier chapel, surrounded by three large chapels with Romanesque barrel vault and groin vault ceilings, which still exist. On top of this structure he built the upper church, 108 meters long and 34 meters wide. The rebuilding proceeded in phases over the next century, culminating in 1145 in a display of public enthusiasm dubbed the &quot;Cult of Carts&quot; – one of several such incidents recorded during the period. It was claimed that during this religious outburst, a crowd of more than a thousand penitents dragged carts filled with building supplies and provisions including stones, wood, grain, etc. to the site.

In 1134, another fire in the town damaged the façade and the bell tower of the cathedral. Construction had already begun on the north tower in the mid-1120s, which was capped with a wooden spire around 1142. The site for the south tower was occupied by the Hotel Dieu that was damaged in the fire. Excavations for that tower were begun straight away. As it rose the sculpture for the Royal Portal (most of which had been carved beforehand) was integrated with the walls of the south tower. The square of the tower was changed to an octagon for the spire just after the Second Crusade. It was finished about 1165 and reached a height of 105 metres or 345 feet, one of the highest in Europe. There was a narthex between the towers and a chapel devoted to Saint Michael. Traces of the vaults and the shafts which supported them are still visible in the western two bays. The stained glass in the three lancet windows over the portals dates from some time before 1145. The Royal Portal on the west façade, between the towers, the primary entrance to the cathedral, was probably finished a year or so after 1140.

===Fire and reconstruction (1194–1260)===
On the night of 10 June 1194, another major fire devastated the cathedral. Only the crypt, the towers, and the new façade survived. The cathedral was already known throughout Europe as a pilgrimage destination, due to the reputed relics of the Virgin Mary that it contained. A legate of the Pope happened to be in Chartres at the time of the fire, and spread the word. Funds were collected from royal and noble patrons across Europe, as well as small donations from ordinary people. Reconstruction began almost immediately. Some portions of the building had survived, including the two towers and the Royal Portal on the west end, and these were incorporated into the new cathedral.

The nave, aisles, and lower levels of the transepts of the new cathedral were probably completed first, then the choir and chapels of the apse; then the upper parts of the transept. By 1220, the roof was in place. The major portions of the new cathedral, with its stained glass and sculpture, were largely finished within just twenty-five years, extraordinarily rapid for the time. The cathedral was formally re-consecrated in October 1260, in the presence of King Louis IX of France, whose coat of arms can be seen painted on a boss at the entrance to the apse, although this was added in the 14th century.

===Later modifications (13th–18th centuries) and the coronation of Henri IV of France===

Relatively few changes were made after this time. An additional seven spires were proposed in the original plans, but these were never built. In 1326, a new two-storey chapel, dedicated to Saint Piatus of Tournai, displaying his relics, was added to the apse. The upper floor of this chapel was accessed by a staircase opening onto the ambulatory. (The chapel is normally closed to visitors, although it occasionally houses temporary exhibitions.) Another chapel was opened in 1417 by Louis, Count of Vendôme, who had been captured by the English at the Battle of Agincourt and fought alongside Joan of Arc at the siege of Orléans. It is located in the fifth bay of the south aisle and is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Its highly ornate Flamboyant Gothic style contrasts with the earlier chapels.
In 1506, lightning destroyed the north spire, which was rebuilt in the &#x27;Flamboyant&#x27; style from 1507 to 1513 by architect Jean Texier. When he finished this, he began constructing a new jubé or Rood screen that separated the ceremonial choir space from the nave, where the worshippers sat.

On 27 February 1594, King Henri IV of France was crowned in Chartres Cathedral, rather than the traditional Reims Cathedral, since both Paris and Reims were occupied at the time by the Catholic League. The ceremony took place in the choir of the church, after which the King and the Bishop mounted the rood screen to be seen by the crowd in the nave. After the ceremony and a mass, they moved to the residence of the bishop next to the cathedral for a banquet.
In 1753, further modifications were made to the interior to adapt it to new theological practices. The stone pillars were covered with stucco, and the tapestries which hung behind the stalls were replaced by marble reliefs. The rood screen that separated the liturgical choir from the nave was torn down and the present stalls were built. At the same time, some of the stained glass in the clerestory was removed and replaced with grisaille windows, greatly increasing the light on the high altar in the center of the church.

===French Revolution and 19th century===
Early in the French Revolution a mob attacked and began to destroy the sculpture on the north porch, but was stopped by a larger crowd of townspeople. The local Revolutionary Committee decided to destroy the cathedral via explosives and asked a local architect to find the best place to set the explosions. He saved the building by pointing out that the vast amount of rubble from the demolished building would so clog the streets it would take years to clear away. The cathedral, like Notre Dame de Paris and other major cathedrals, became the property of the French State and worship was halted until the time of Napoleon, but it was not further damaged.

In 1836, due to the negligence of workmen, a fire began which destroyed the lead-covered wooden roof and the two belfries, but the building structure and the stained glass were untouched. The old roof was replaced by a copper-covered roof on an iron frame. At the time, the framework over the crossing had the largest span of any iron-framed construction in Europe.

===World War II===
The Second World War, in France, was fought between the Allies and Axis powers of Germany and Italy. In July 1944, the British and Canadians found themselves restrained just south of Caen. The Americans and their five divisions planned an alternative route to the Germans. While some Americans headed west and south, others found themselves in a sweep east of Caen that led them behind the frontline of the German forces. Hitler ordered the German commissioner, Kluge, to head west to cut off the Americans. This ultimately led the Allies to Chartres in mid-August 1944.

On 16 August 1944, the cathedral was saved from destruction thanks to the American colonel Welborn Barton Griffith Jr. (1901–1944), who questioned the order he was given to target the cathedral. The Americans believed that the steeples and towers were being used as an observation post for German artillery.

Griffith, accompanied by a volunteer soldier, instead decided to go and verify whether or not the Germans were using the cathedral. Griffith could see that the cathedral was empty, so he had the cathedral bells ring as a signal for the Americans not to shoot. Upon hearing the bells, the American command rescinded the order to fire. Colonel Griffith died in combat action that same day, in the town of Lèves, near Chartres. He was posthumously decorated with the &quot;Croix de Guerre avec Palme&quot; (War Cross 1939–1945), the &quot;Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; (Legion of Honour) and the &quot;Ordre National du Mérite&quot; (National Order of Merit) of the French government and the Distinguished Service Cross of the American government.

=== 2009 restoration ===
In 2009, the Monuments Historiques division of the French Ministry of Culture began an $18.5-million program of works at the cathedral, cleaning the inside and outside, protecting the stained glass with a coating, and cleaning and painting the inside masonry creamy-white with &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; marbling and gilded detailing, as it may have looked in the 13th century. This has been a subject of controversy (see below).

===Liturgy===
The cathedral is the seat of the Bishop of Chartres of the Diocese of Chartres. The diocese is part of the ecclesiastical province of Tours.

Every evening since the events of 11 September 2001, Vespers are sung by the Chemin Neuf Community.

===Plan and elevation – flying buttresses===
The plan, like other Gothic cathedrals, is in the form of a cross and was determined by the shape and size of the 11th-century Romanesque cathedral, whose crypt and vestiges are underneath it. A two-bay narthex at the western end opens into a seven bay nave leading to the crossing, from which wide transepts extend three bays each to north and south. East of the crossing are four rectangular bays terminating in a semicircular apse. The nave and transepts are flanked by single aisles, broadening to a double-aisled ambulatory around the choir and apse. From the ambulatory three deep semi-circular chapels radiate (overlying the deep chapels of Fulbert&#x27;s 11th-century crypt).

While the floor plan was traditional, the elevation was bolder and more original, thanks to the use of the flying buttress to support the upper walls. This was the first known use in a Gothic cathedral. These heavy columns of stone were joined to the walls by double stone arches, and reinforced by columns, like the spokes of a wheel. Each of these columns is made from a single piece of stone. The arches press against the walls, counterbalancing the outward thrust from the rib vaults over the cathedral interior. These vaults were also innovative, having just four compartments, unlike the six-part vaults of earlier Gothic churches. They were lighter and could cross a greater distance. Since the flying buttresses were experimental, the architect prudently added additional buttresses concealed under roofs of the aisles.

The elevations of earlier Gothic cathedrals usually had four levels to give them solidity; an arcade of massive columns on the ground floor, supporting a wide arched tribune gallery or tribune, below a narrower arcade triforium; then, under the roof, the higher and thinner walls, or clerestory, where the windows were. Thanks to the buttresses, the architects of Chartres could eliminate the gallery entirely, make the triforium very narrow, and have much more room for windows above. Chartres was not the first cathedral to use this innovation, but it used it much more consistently and effectively throughout. This buttressing plan was adopted by the other major 13th-century cathedrals, notably Amiens Cathedral and Reims Cathedral.

Another architectural innovation at Chartres was the design of the massive piers or pillars on the ground floor which receive the weight of the roof through the thin stone ribs of vaults above. The weight of the roof is carried by the thin stone ribs of the vaults outwards to the walls, where it is counterbalanced by the flying buttresses, and downwards, first through columns made of ribs joined together, then by alternating round and octagonal solid cored piers, each of which bundles together four half-columns. This pier design, known as &quot;pilier cantonné&quot;, was strong, simple, and elegant, and permitted the large stained glass windows of the clerestory, or upper level.

Although the sculpture on the portals at Chartres is generally of a high standard, the various carved elements inside, such as the capitals and string courses, are relatively poorly finished (when compared for example with those at Reims or Soissons) – the reason is simply that the portals were carved from the finest Parisian limestone, or &#x27; &#x27;calcaire&#x27; &#x27;, while the internal capitals were carved from the local &quot;Berchères stone&quot;, that is hard to work and can be brittle.

==The towers and clock==
The two towers were built at different times, during the Gothic period, and have different heights and decoration. The north tower was begun in 1134, to replace a Romanesque tower that was damaged by fire. It was completed in 1150 and originally was just two stories high, with a lead-covered roof. The south tower was begun in about 1144 and was finished in 1150. It was more ambitious, and has an octagonal masonry spire on a square tower, and reaches a height of 105 meters. It was built without an interior wooden framework; the flat stone sides narrow progressively to the pinnacle, and heavy stone pyramids around the base give it additional support.

The two towers survived the devastating fire of 1194, which destroyed most of the cathedral except the west façade and crypt. As the cathedral was rebuilt, the famous west rose window was installed between the two towers (13th century), and in 1507, the architect Jean Texier (also sometimes known as Jehan de Beauce) designed a spire for the north tower, to give it a height and appearance closer to that of the south tower. This work was completed in 1513. The north tower is in a more decorative Flamboyant Gothic style, with pinnacles and buttresses. It reaches a height of 113 meters, just above the south tower. Plans were made for the addition of seven more spires around the cathedral, but these were abandoned.

At the base of the north tower is a small structure which contains a Renaissance-era twenty-four-hour clock with a polychrome face, constructed in 1520 by Jean Texier. The face of the clock is eighteen feet in diameter.

A fire in 1836 destroyed the roof and belfries of the cathedral, and melted the bells, but did not damage the structure below or the stained glass. The timber beams under the roof were replaced with an iron framework covered with copper plates.

==The portals and their sculpture==
The cathedral has three great portals or entrances, opening into the nave from the west and into the transepts from north and south. The portals are richly decorated with sculptures, which rendered biblical stories and theological ideas visible for both the educated clergy and layfolk who may not have had access to textual learning. Each of the three portals on the west façade (made 1145–1155) focuses on a different aspect of Christ&#x27;s role in the world; on the right, his earthly Incarnation, on the left, his Ascension or his existence before his Incarnation (the era &quot;ante legem&quot;), and, in the center, his Second Coming, initiating the End of Time. The statuary of the Chartres portals is considered among the finest existing Gothic sculpture.

===West, or Royal Portal (12th century)===

One of the few parts of the cathedral to survive the 1194 fire, the &quot;Portail royal&quot; was integrated into the new cathedral. Opening on to the &quot;parvis&quot; (the large square in front of the cathedral where markets were held), the two lateral doors would have been the first entry point for most visitors to Chartres, as they remain today. The central door is only opened for the entry of processions on major festivals, of which the most important is the &quot;Adventus&quot; or installation of a new bishop. The harmonious appearance of the façade results in part from the relative proportions of the central and lateral portals, whose widths are in the ratio 10:7 – one of the common medieval approximations of the square root of 2.

As well as their basic functions of providing access to the interior, portals are the main locations for sculpted images on the Gothic cathedral and it is on the west façade at Chartres that this practice began to develop into a visual &quot;summa&quot; or encyclopedia of theological knowledge. Each of the three portals focuses on a different aspect of Christ&#x27;s role in salvation history; his earthly incarnation on the right, his Ascension or existence before the Incarnation on the left, and his Second Coming (the Theophanic Vision) in the center.

Above the right portal, the lintel is carved in two registers with (lower) the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity, Annunciation to the Shepherds and (upper) the Presentation in the Temple. Above this the tympanum shows the Virgin and Child enthroned in the &quot;Sedes sapientiae&quot; pose. Surrounding the tympanum, as a reminder of the glory days of the School of Chartres, the archivolts are carved with some very distinctive personifications of the Seven Liberal Arts as well as the classical authors and philosophers most closely associated with them.

The left portal is more enigmatic and art historians still argue over the correct identification. The tympanum shows Christ standing on a cloud, apparently supported by two angels. Some see this as a depiction of the Ascension of Christ (in which case the figures on the lower lintel would represent the disciples witnessing the event) while others see it as representing the &quot;Parousia&quot;, or Second Coming of Christ (in which case the lintel figures could be either the prophets who foresaw that event or else the &#x27;Men of Galilee&#x27; mentioned in Acts 1:9–11). The presence of angels in the upper lintel, descending from a cloud and apparently shouting to those below, would seem to support the latter interpretation. The archivolts contain the signs of the zodiac and the labours of the months – standard references to the cyclical nature of time which appear in many Gothic portals.

The central portal is a more conventional representation of the End of Time as described in the Book of Revelation. In the center of the tympanum is Christ within a mandorla, surrounded by the four symbols of the evangelists (the &quot;Tetramorph&quot;). The lintel shows the Twelve Apostles while the archivolts show the 24 Elders of the Apocalypse.

Although the upper parts of the three portals are treated separately, two sculptural elements run horizontally across the façade, uniting its different parts. Most obvious are the jamb statues affixed to the columns flanking the doorways – tall, slender standing figures of kings and queens from whom the &quot;Portail royal&quot; derived its name. Although in the 18th and 19th century these figures were mistakenly identified as the Merovingian monarchs of France (thus attracting the opprobrium of Revolutionary iconoclasts) they almost certainly represent the kings and queens of the Old Testament – another standard iconographical feature of Gothic portals.

Less obvious than the jamb statues but far more intricately carved is the frieze that stretches all across the façade in the sculpted capitals on top of the jamb columns. Carved into these capitals is a very lengthy narrative depicting the life of the Virgin and the life and Passion of Christ.

===North transept portals (13th century)===

The statuary of the north transept portals is devoted to the Old Testament, and the events leading up to the birth of Christ, with particular emphasis on the Virgin Mary. The glorification of Mary in the center, the incarnation of her son on the left and Old Testament prefigurations and prophecies on the right. One major exception to this scheme is the presence of large statues of St Modesta (a local martyr) and St Potentian on the north west corner of the porch, close to a small doorway where pilgrims visiting the crypt (where their relics were stored) would once have emerged.

As well as the main sculptural areas around the portals themselves, the deep porches are filled with other carvings depicting a range of subjects including local saints, Old Testament narratives, naturalistic foliage, fantastical beasts, Labours of the Months and personifications of the &#x27;active and contemplative lives&#x27; (the &quot;vita activa&quot; and &quot;vita contemplativa&quot;). The personifications of the &quot;vita activa&quot; (directly overhead, just inside the inside of the left hand porch) are of particular interest for their meticulous depictions of the various stages in the preparation of flax – an important cash crop in the area during the Middle Ages.

===South portal (13th century)===
The south portal, which was added later than the others, in the 13th century, is devoted to events after the Crucifixion of Christ, and particularly to the Christian martyrs. The decoration of the central bay concentrates on the Last Judgment and the Apostles; the left bay on the lives of martyrs; and the right bay is devoted to confessor saints. This arrangement is repeated in the stained glass windows of the apse. The arches and columns of the porch are lavishly decorated with sculpture representing the labours of the months, the signs of the zodiac, and statues representing the virtues and vices. On top of the porch, between the gables, are pinnacles in the arcades with statues of eighteen Kings, beginning with King David, representing the lineage of Christ, and linking the Old Testament and the New.

==Angels and monsters==
While most of the sculpture of the cathedral portrayed saints, apostles and other Biblical figures, such as the angel holding a sundial on the south façade, other sculpture at Chartres was designed to warn the faithful. These works include statues of assorted monsters and demons. Some of these figures, such as gargoyles, also had a practical function; these served as rain spouts to project water far away from the walls. Others, like the chimera and the strix, were designed to show the consequences of disregarding Biblical teachings.

==Nave and ambulatory==
The nave, or main space for the congregation, was designed especially to receive pilgrims, who would often sleep in the church. The floor is slightly tilted so that it could be washed out with water each morning. The rooms on either side of Royal Portal still have traces of construction of the earlier Romanesque building. The nave itself was built after the fire, beginning in 1194. The floor of the nave also has a labyrinth in the pavement (see labyrinth section below). The two rows of alternating octagonal and round pillars on either side of the nave receive part of the weight of the roof through the thin stone ribs descending from the vaults above. The rest of the weight is distributed by the vaults outwards to the walls, supported by flying buttresses.

The statue of Mary and the infant Christ, called Our Lady of the Pillar, replaces a 16th-century statue which was burned by the Revolutionaries in 1793.

==Stained glass windows==

One of the most distinctive features of Chartres Cathedral is the stained glass, both for its quantity and quality. There are 167 windows, including rose windows, round oculi, and tall, pointed lancet windows. The architecture of the cathedral, with its innovative combination of rib vaults and flying buttresses, permitted the construction of much higher and thinner walls, particularly at the top clerestory level, allowing more and larger windows. Also, Chartres contains fewer plain or grisaille windows than later cathedrals, and more windows with densely stained glass panels, making the interior of Chartres darker but the colour of the light deeper and richer.

===12th century windows===

These are the oldest windows in the cathedral. The right window, the Jesse Window, depicts the genealogy of Christ. The middle window depicts the life of Christ, and the left window depicts the Passion of Christ, from the Transfiguration and Last Supper to the Resurrection. All three of these windows were originally made around 1145 but were restored in the early 13th century and again in the 19th.

The other 12th-century window, perhaps the most famous at Chartres, is the &quot;Notre-Dame de la Belle-Verrière&quot;, or &quot;The Blue Virgin&quot;. It is found in the first bay of the choir after the south transept. Most windows are made up of around 25 to 30 individual panels showing distinct episodes within the narrative; only Notre-Dame de la Belle-Verrière includes a larger image made up of multiple panels. This window is actually a composite; the upper part, showing the Virgin and Child surrounded by adoring angels, dates from around 1180 and was probably positioned at the center of the apse in the earlier building. The Virgin is depicted wearing a blue robe and sitting in a frontal pose on a throne, with the Christ Child seated on her lap raising his hand in blessing. This composition, known as the &quot;Sedes sapientiae&quot; (&quot;Throne of Wisdom&quot;), which also appears on the &quot;Portail royal&quot;, is based on the famous cult figure kept in the crypt. The lower part of the window, showing scenes from the infancy of Christ, dates from the main glazing campaign around 1225.

===Rose windows===

The cathedral has three large rose windows. The western rose (, 12 m in diameter) shows the Last Judgment – a traditional theme for west façades. A central oculus showing Christ as the Judge is surrounded by an inner ring of twelve paired roundels containing angels and the Elders of the Apocalypse and an outer ring of 12 roundels showing the dead emerging from their tombs and the angels blowing trumpets to summon them to judgment.

The north transept rose (10.5 m diameter, ), like much of the sculpture in the north porch beneath it, is dedicated to the Virgin. The central oculus shows the Virgin and Child and is surrounded by twelve small petal-shaped windows, four with doves (the &#x27;Four Gifts of the Spirit&#x27;), the rest with adoring angels carrying candlesticks. Beyond this is a ring of twelve diamond-shaped openings containing the Old Testament Kings of Judah, another ring of smaller lozenges containing the arms of France and Castille, and finally a ring of semicircles containing Old Testament Prophets holding scrolls. The presence of the arms of the French king (yellow fleurs-de-lis on a blue background) and of his mother, Blanche of Castile (yellow castles on a red background) are taken as a sign of royal patronage for this window. Beneath the rose itself are five tall lancet windows (7.5 m high) showing, in the center, the Virgin as an infant held by her mother, St Anne – the same subject as the trumeau in the portal beneath it. Flanking this lancet are four more containing Old Testament figures. Each of these standing figures is shown symbolically triumphing over an enemy depicted in the base of the lancet beneath them – David over Saul, Aaron over Pharaoh, St Anne over &quot;Synagoga&quot;, etc.

The south transept rose (10.5 m diameter, made ) is dedicated to Christ, who is shown in the central oculus, right hand raised in benediction, surrounded by adoring angels. Two outer rings of twelve circles each contain the 24 Elders of the Apocalypse, crowned and carrying phials and musical instruments. The central lancet beneath the rose shows the Virgin carrying the infant Christ. Either side of this are four lancets showing the four evangelists sitting on the shoulders of four prophets – a rare literal illustration of the theological principle that the New Testament builds upon the Old Testament. This window was a donation of the Mauclerc family, the Counts of Dreux-Bretagne, who are depicted with their arms in the bases of the lancets.

===Windows in aisles and the choir ambulatory===


Each bay of the aisles and the choir ambulatory contains one large lancet window, most of them roughly 8.1m high by 2.2m wide. The subjects depicted in these windows, made between 1205 and 1235, include stories from the Old and New Testament and the Lives of the Saints as well as typological cycles and symbolic images such as the signs of the zodiac and labours of the months. One of the most famous examples is the Good Samaritan parable.

Several of the windows at Chartres include images of local tradesmen or labourers in the lowest two or three panels, often with details of their equipment and working methods. Traditionally it was claimed that these images represented the guilds of the donors who paid for the windows. In recent years however this view has largely been discounted, not least because each window would have cost around as much as a large mansion house to make – while most of the labourers depicted would have been subsistence workers with little or no disposable income. Furthermore, although they became powerful and wealthy organisations in the later medieval period, none of these trade guilds had actually been founded when the glass was being made in the early 13th century. Another possible explanation is that the cathedral clergy wanted to emphasise the universal reach of the Church, particularly at a time when their relationship with the local community was often a troubled one.

===Clerestory windows===
Because of their greater distance from the viewer, the windows in the clerestory generally adopt simpler, bolder designs. Most feature the standing figure of a saint or Apostle in the upper two-thirds, often with one or two simplified narrative scenes in the lower part, either to help identify the figure or else to remind the viewer of some key event in their life. Whereas the lower windows in the nave arcades and the ambulatory consist of one simple lancet per bay, the clerestory windows are each made up of a pair of lancets with a plate-traceried rose window above. The nave and transept clerestory windows mainly depict saints and Old Testament prophets. Those in the choir depict the kings of France and Castile and members of the local nobility in the straight bays, while the windows in the apse hemicycle show those Old Testament prophets who foresaw the virgin birth, flanking scenes of the Annunciation, Visitation and Nativity in the axial window.

====Later windows====

On the whole, Chartres&#x27; windows have been remarkably fortunate. The medieval glass largely escaped harm during the Huguenot iconoclasm and the religious wars of the 16th century although the west rose sustained damage from artillery fire in 1591. The relative darkness of the interior seems to have been a problem for some. A few windows were replaced with much lighter grisaille glass in the 14th century to improve illumination, particularly on the north side and several more were replaced with clear glass in 1753 as part of the reforms to liturgical practice that also led to the removal of the &quot;jubé&quot; (rood screen). The installation of the Vendôme Chapel between two buttresses of the nave in the early 15th century resulted in the loss of one more lancet window, though it did allow for the insertion of a fine late-Gothic window with donor portraits of Louis de Bourbon and his family witnessing the Coronation of the Virgin with assorted saints.

Although estimates vary (depending on how one counts compound or grouped windows) approximately 152 of the original 176 stained glass windows survive – far more than any other medieval cathedral anywhere in the world.

Like most medieval buildings, the windows at Chartres suffered badly from the corrosive effects of atmospheric acids during the Industrial Revolution and thereafter. The majority of windows were cleaned and restored by the famous local workshop &quot;Atelier Lorin&quot; at the end of the 19th century, but they continued to deteriorate. During World War II most of the stained glass was removed from the cathedral and stored in the surrounding countryside to protect it from damage. At the close of the war the windows were taken out of storage and reinstalled. Since then, an ongoing programme of conservation has been underway and isothermal secondary glazing was gradually installed on the exterior to protect the windows from further damage.

==The crypt (9th–11th century)==
The small Saint Lubin Crypt, under the choir of the cathedral, was constructed in the 9th century and is the oldest part of the building. It is surrounded by a much larger crypt, the Saint Fulbert Crypt, which was completed in 1025, five years after the fire that destroyed most of the older cathedral. It is U-shaped and 230 meters long, next to the crypts of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome and Canterbury Cathedral. It is the largest crypt in Europe and serves as the foundation of the cathedral above.

The corridors and chapels of the crypt are covered with Romanesque barrel vaults, groin vaults where two barrel vaults meet at right angles, and a few more modern Gothic rib-vaults.

One notable feature of the crypt is the Well of the Saints-Forts. The well is thirty-three metres deep and is probably of Celtic origin. According to legend, Quirinus, the Roman magistrate of the Gallo-Roman town, had the early Christian martyrs thrown down the well. A statue of one of the martyrs, Modeste, is featured among the sculpture on the North Portico.

Another notable feature is the Our Lady of the Crypt Chapel. A reliquary here contains a fragment of the reputed veil of the Virgin Mary, which was donated to the cathedral in 876 by Charles the Bald, the grandson of Charlemagne. The silk veil was divided into pieces during the French Revolution. The largest piece is shown in one of the ambulatory chapels above. and the small Shrine of Our Lady of the Crypt. The altar of the chapel is carved from a single block of limestone from the Berchères quarry, the source of most of the stone of the cathedral. The fresco on the wall dates from about 1200 and depicts the Virgin Mary on her throne. The Three Kings are to her left, and the Apostles Savinien and Potentien to her right. The chapel also has a modern stained glass window, the &quot;Mary, Door to Heaven Window&quot;, made by Henri Guérin, made by cementing together thick slabs of stained glass.

== High altar (18th century) ==
== Choir wall (16th–18th centuries) ==
The high ornamental stone screen that separates the choir from the ambulatory was put in place between the 16th and 18th century, to adapt the church to a change in liturgy. It was built in the late Flamboyant Gothic and then the Renaissance style. The screen has forty niches along the ambulatory filled with statues by prominent sculptors telling the life of Christ. The last statues were put in place in 1714.

== Grand Organ ==

The buffet, or wooden case of the grand organ of the cathedral is among the oldest in France. It was first built in the 14th century, rebuilt in 1475, and enlarged in 1542. Both the organ and the tribune have been classified as separate historic monuments since 1840.

The organ is placed in the nave at the crossing of the south transept, sixteen meters above the floor of the nave, in close proximity to the choir, to assure the best sound quality throughout the cathedral. The whole case is fifteen meters high, with the top of its central tower thirty meters above the floor of the nave. The case was rebuilt during the Renaissance, and largely took its present form. Closer study of the case by the Ministry of Culture showed that the early case was covered with polychrome painting; yellow ochre under a varnish of reddish brown in earlier layer, and later by a brighter yellow on white. This study also showed that the mechanism was in very poor condition, and urgently needed reconstruction.

A major rebuilding and enlargement of the organ instrument took place in 1969–71, both to restore the ageing mechanism, and to add new keys and functions. The case was also restored, with the cost paid entirely by the French State, as was part of the cost of restoring the organ itself. As a result of this, and after further work on the organ in 1996, the instrument has 70 stops, totaling of over 4000 pipes.

==Labyrinth==

The labyrinth (early 1200s) is a famous feature of the cathedral, located on the floor in the center of the nave. Labyrinths were found in almost all Gothic cathedrals, though most were later removed since they distracted from the religious services in the nave. They symbolized the long winding path towards salvation. Unlike mazes, there was only a single path that could be followed. On certain days the chairs of the nave are removed so that visiting pilgrims can follow the labyrinth. Copies of the Chartres labyrinth are found at other churches and cathedrals, including Grace Cathedral, San Francisco. Artist Kent Bellows depicts a direct reference to the labyrinth, which he renders in the background of at least one of his artworks; &quot;Mandala&quot;, 1990, Pencil on paper, 18 x 19 1/2 in.

==Chapel of Piatus of Tournai, bishop&#x27;s palace and gardens==

The Chapel of Saint Piatus of Tournai was a later addition to the cathedral, built in 1326, close to the apse at the east end of the cathedral. It contained a collection of reputed relics from the saint, who was bishop of Tournai in modern-day Belgium in the third century. Martyred by the Romans, who cut off the top of his skull, he is depicted in stained glass and sculpture holding the fragment of his skull in his hands. The chapel has a flat chevet and two circular towers. Inside are four bays, in a harmonious style, since it was built all at the same time. It also contains a notable collection of 14th-century stained glass. The lower floor was used as a chapter house, or meeting place for official functions, and the top floor was connected to the cathedral by an open stairway.

The sacristy, across from the north portal of the cathedral, was built in the second half of the 13th century. The bishop&#x27;s palace, also to the north, is built of brick and stone, and dates to the 17th century. A gateway from the period of Louis XV leads to the palace and also gives access to the terraced gardens, which offer of good view of the cathedral, particularly the chevet of the cathedral at the east end, with its radiating chapels built over the earlier Romanesque vaults. The lower garden also has a labyrinth of hedges.

==Construction==
Work was begun on the Royal Portal with the south lintel around 1136 and with all its sculpture installed up to 1141. Opinions are uncertain as the sizes and styles of the figures vary and some elements, such as the lintel over the right-hand portal, have clearly been cut down to fit the available spaces. The sculpture was originally designed for these portals, but the layouts were changed by successive masters, see careful lithic analysis by John James. Either way, most of the carving follows the exceptionally high standard typical of this period and exercised a strong influence on the subsequent development of Gothic portal design.

Some of the masters have been identified by John James, and drafts of these studies have been published on the web site of the International Center of Medieval Art, New York.

On 10 June 1194, another fire caused extensive damage to Fulbert&#x27;s cathedral. The true extent of the damage is unknown, though the fact that the lead cames holding the west windows together survived the conflagration intact suggests contemporary accounts of the terrible devastation may have been exaggerated. Either way, the opportunity was taken to begin a complete rebuilding of the choir and nave in the latest style. The undamaged western towers and façade were incorporated into the new works, as was the earlier crypt, effectively limiting the designers of the new building to the same general plan as its predecessor. In fact, the present building is only marginally longer than Fulbert&#x27;s cathedral.

One of the features of Chartres cathedral is the speed with which it was built – a factor which helped contribute to the consistency of its design. Even though there were innumerable changes to the details, the plan remains consistent. The major change occurred six years after work began when the seven deep chapels around the choir opening off a single ambulatory were turned into shallow recesses opening off a double-aisled ambulatory.

Australian architectural historian John James, who made a detailed study of the cathedral, has estimated that there were about 300 men working on the site at any one time, although it has to be acknowledged that current knowledge of working practices at this time is somewhat limited. Normally medieval churches were built from east to west so that the choir could be completed first and put into use (with a temporary wall sealing off the west end) while the crossing and nave were completed. Canon Delaporte argued that building work started at the crossing and proceeded outwards from there, but the evidence in the stonework itself is unequivocal, especially within the level of the triforium: the nave was at all times more advanced than ambulatory bays of the choir, and this has been confirmed by dendrochronology.

The builders were not working on a clean site; they would have had to clear back the rubble and surviving parts of the old church as they built the new. Work nevertheless progressed rapidly: the south porch with most of its sculpture was installed by 1210, and by 1215 the north porch and the west rose window were completed. The nave high vaults were erected in the 1220s, the canons moved into their new stalls in 1221 under a temporary roof at the level of the clerestory, and the transept roses were erected over the next two decades. The high vaults over the choir were not built until the last years of the 1250s, as was rediscovered in the first decade of the 21st century.

==Restoration==
From 1997 until 2018, the exterior of the cathedral underwent an extensive cleaning, that also included many of the interior walls and the sculpture. The statement of purpose declared, &quot;the restoration aims not only to clean and maintains the structure but also to offer an insight into what the cathedral would have looked like in the 13th century.&quot; The walls and sculpture, blackened by soot and age, again became white. The celebrated Black Madonna statue was cleaned, and her face was found to be white under the soot. The project went further; the walls in the nave were painted white and shades of yellow and beige, to recreate an idea of the earlier medieval decoration. However, the restoration also brought sharp criticism. The architectural critic of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Martin Filler, called it &quot;a scandalous desecration of a cultural holy place.&quot; He also noted that the bright white walls made it more difficult to appreciate the colours of the stained glass windows, and declared that the work violated international conservation protocols, in particular, the 1964 Charter of Venice of which France is a signatory. The president of the Friends of Chartres Cathedral Isabelle Paillot defended the restoration work as necessary to prevent the building from crumbling.

==The School of Chartres==

At the beginning of the 11th century, Bishop Fulbert besides rebuilding the cathedral, established Chartres as a cathedral school, an important center of religious scholarship and theology. He attracted important theologians, including Thierry of Chartres, William of Conches and the Englishman John of Salisbury. These men were at the forefront of the intense intellectual rethinking that culminated in what is now known as the twelfth-century renaissance, pioneering the Scholastic philosophy that came to dominate medieval thinking throughout Europe. By the mid-12th century, the role of Chartres had waned, as it was replaced by the University of Paris as the leading school of theology. The primary activity of Chartres became pilgrimages.

==Social and economic context==

As with any medieval bishopric, Chartres Cathedral was the most important building in the town – the center of its economy, its most famous landmark and the focal point of many activities that in modern towns are provided for by specialised civic buildings. In the Middle Ages, the cathedral functioned as a kind of marketplace, with different commercial activities centred on the different portals, particularly during the regular fairs. Textiles were sold around the north transept, while meat, vegetable and fuel sellers congregated around the south porch. Money-changers (an essential service at a time when each town or region had its own currency) had their benches, or &quot;banques&quot;, near the west portals and also in the nave itself. Wine sellers plied their trade in the nave to avoid taxes until, sometime in the 13th century, an ordinance forbade this. The ordinance assigned to the wine-sellers part of the crypt, where they could avoid the count&#x27;s taxes without disturbing worshippers. Workers of various professions gathered in particular locations around the cathedral awaiting offers of work.

Although the town of Chartres was under the judicial and tax authority of the Counts of Blois, the area immediately surrounding the cathedral, known as the &quot;cloître&quot;, was in effect a free-trade zone governed by the church authorities, who were entitled to the taxes from all commercial activity taking place there. As well as greatly increasing the cathedral&#x27;s income, throughout the 12th and 13th centuries this led to regular disputes, often violent, between the bishops, the chapter and the civic authorities – particularly when serfs belonging to the counts transferred their trade (and taxes) to the cathedral. In 1258, after a series of bloody riots instigated by the count&#x27;s officials, the chapter finally gained permission from the King to seal off the area of the &quot;cloître&quot; and lock the gates each night.

==Pilgrimages and the legend of the &quot;Sancta Camisa&quot;==

Even before the Gothic cathedral was built, Chartres was a place of pilgrimage, albeit on a much smaller scale. During the Merovingian and early Carolingian eras, the main focus of devotion for pilgrims was a well (now located in the north side of Fulbert&#x27;s crypt), known as the &quot;Puits des Saints-Forts&quot;, or the &#x27;Well of the Strong Saints&#x27;, into which it was believed the bodies of various local Early-Christian martyrs (including saints Piat, Chéron, Modesta and Potentianus) had been tossed.

Chartres became a site for the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 876 the cathedral acquired the &quot;Sancta Camisa&quot;, believed to be the tunic worn by Mary at the time of Christ&#x27;s birth. According to legend, the relic was given to the cathedral by Charlemagne who received it as a gift from Emperor Constantine VI during a crusade to Jerusalem. However, as Charlemagne&#x27;s crusade is fiction, the legend lacks historical merit and was probably invented in the 11th century to authenticate relics at the Abbey of St Denis. In fact, the &quot;Sancta Camisa&quot; was a gift to the cathedral from Charles the Bald and there is no evidence for its being an important object of pilgrimage prior to the 12th century. In 1194, when the cathedral was struck by lightning, and the east spire was lost, the Sancta Camisa was thought lost, too. However, it was found three days later, protected by priests, who fled behind iron trapdoors when the fire broke out.

Some research suggests that depictions in the cathedral, e.g. Mary&#x27;s infertile parents Joachim and Anne, harken back to the pre-Christian cult of a fertility goddess, and women would come to the well at this location in order to pray for their children and that some refer to that past. Chartres historian and expert Malcolm Miller rejected the claims of pre-cathedral, Celtic, ceremonies and buildings on the site in a documentary. However, the widespread belief that the cathedral was also the site of a pre-Christian druidical sect who worshipped a &quot;Virgin who will give birth&quot; is purely a late-medieval invention.

By the end of the 12th century, the church had become one of the most important popular pilgrimage destinations in Europe. There were four great fairs which coincided with the main feast days of the Virgin Mary: the Presentation, the Annunciation, the Assumption and the Nativity. The fairs were held in the area administered by the cathedral and were attended by many of the pilgrims in town to see the cloak of the Virgin. Specific pilgrimages were also held in response to outbreaks of disease. When ergotism (more popularly known in the Middle Ages as &quot;St. Anthony&#x27;s fire&quot;) afflicted many victims, the crypt of the original church became a hospital to care for the sick.

Today Chartres continues to attract large numbers of pilgrims, many of whom come to walk slowly around the labyrinth, their heads bowed in prayer – a devotional practice that the cathedral authorities accommodate by removing the chairs from the nave on Fridays from Lent to All Saints&#x27; Day (except for Good Friday).

==Popular culture==

Orson Welles famously used Chartres as a visual backdrop and inspiration for a montage sequence in his film &quot;F For Fake&quot;. Welles&#x27; semi-autobiographical narration spoke to the power of art in culture and how the work itself may be more important than the identity of its creators. Feeling that the beauty of Chartres and its unknown artisans and architects epitomized this sentiment, Welles, standing outside the cathedral and looking at it, eulogizes:

Now this has been standing here for centuries. The premier work of man perhaps in the whole western world and it&#x27;s without a signature: Chartres.

A celebration to God&#x27;s glory and to the dignity of man. All that&#x27;s left most artists seem to feel these days, is man. Naked, poor, forked radish. There aren&#x27;t any celebrations. Ours, the scientists keep telling us, is a universe, which is disposable. You know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all things, this rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all our cities are dust, to stand intact, to mark where we have been, to testify to what we had it in us, to accomplish.

Our works in stone, in paint, in print are spared, some of them for a few decades, or a millennium or two, but everything must finally fall in war or wear away into the ultimate and universal ash. The triumphs and the frauds, the treasures and the fakes. A fact of life. We&#x27;re going to die. &quot;Be of good heart,&quot; cry the dead artists out of the living past. Our songs will all be silenced – but what of it? Go on singing. Maybe a man&#x27;s name doesn&#x27;t matter all that much.

(Church bells peal...)

Rudyard Kipling took the stained glass at Chartres as the inspiration for his poem &quot;Chartres Windows&quot;. 
Joseph Campbell references his spiritual experience in &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;:

I&#x27;m back in the Middle Ages. I&#x27;m back in the world that I was brought up in as a child, the Roman Catholic spiritual-image world, and it is magnificent ... That cathedral talks to me about the spiritual information of the world. It&#x27;s a place for meditation, just walking around, just sitting, just looking at those beautiful things.

Joris-Karl Huysmans includes detailed interpretation of the symbolism underlying the art of Chartres Cathedral in his 1898 semi-autobiographical novel &quot;La cathédrale&quot;.

Chartres was the primary basis for the fictional cathedral in David Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;Cathedral: The Story of Its Construction&quot; and the animated special based on this book.

Chartres was an important setting in the religious thriller &quot;Gospel Truths&quot; by J. G. Sandom. The book used the cathedral&#x27;s architecture and history as clues in the search for a lost Gospel.

The cathedral is featured in the television travel series &quot;The Naked Pilgrim&quot;; presenter Brian Sewell explores the cathedral and discusses its famous relic – the nativity cloak said to have been worn by the Virgin Mary.

Popular action-adventure video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; features a climbable cathedral modelled heavily on the Chartres Cathedral.

Chartres Cathedral and, especially, its labyrinth are featured in the novels &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The City of Tears&quot; by Kate Mosse, who was educated in and is a resident of Chartres&#x27; twin city Chichester.

==Chartres Light Celebration==
One of the attractions at the Chartres Cathedral is the Chartres Light Celebration, when not only is the cathedral lit, but so are many buildings throughout the town, as a celebration of electrification.

<text>Flea, the common name for the order Siphonaptera, includes 2,500 species of small flightless insects that live as external parasites of mammals and birds. Fleas live by ingesting the blood of their hosts. Adult fleas grow to about long, are usually brown, and have bodies that are &quot;flattened&quot; sideways or narrow, enabling them to move through their hosts&#x27; fur or feathers. They lack wings; their hind legs are extremely well adapted for jumping. Their claws keep them from being dislodged, and their mouthparts are adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood. Some species can leap 50 times their body length, a feat second only to jumps made by another group of insects, the superfamily of froghoppers. Flea larvae are worm-like, with no limbs; they have chewing mouthparts and feed on organic debris left on their hosts&#x27; skin.

Genetic evidence indicates that fleas are a specialised lineage of parasitic scorpionflies (Mecoptera) &quot;sensu lato&quot;, most closely related to the family Nannochoristidae. The earliest known fleas lived in the Middle Jurassic; modern-looking forms appeared in the Cenozoic. Fleas probably originated on mammals first and expanded their reach to birds. Each species of flea specializes, more or less, on one species of host: many species of flea never breed on any other host; some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group; for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews.

The oriental rat flea, &quot;Xenopsylla cheopis&quot;, is a vector of &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, the bacterium that causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread to humans by rodents, such as the black rat, which were bitten by infected fleas. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian, about 540, and the Black Death, about 1350, each of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world&#x27;s people.

Fleas appear in human culture in such diverse forms as flea circuses; poems, such as John Donne&#x27;s erotic &quot;The Flea&quot;; works of music, such as those by Modest Mussorgsky; and a film by Charlie Chaplin.

== Morphology and behavior ==
Fleas are wingless insects, long, that are agile, usually dark colored (for example, the reddish-brown of the cat flea), with a proboscis, or stylet, adapted to feeding by piercing the skin and sucking their host&#x27;s blood through their epipharynx. Flea legs end in strong claws that are adapted to grasp a host.

Unlike other insects, fleas do not possess compound eyes but instead only have simple eyespots with a single biconvex lens; some species lack eyes altogether. Their bodies are laterally compressed, permitting easy movement through the hairs or feathers on the host&#x27;s body. The flea body is covered with hard plates called sclerites. These sclerites are covered with many hairs and short spines directed backward, which also assist its movements on the host. The tough body is able to withstand great pressure, likely an adaptation to survive attempts to eliminate them by scratching.

Fleas lay tiny, white, oval eggs. The larvae are small and pale, have bristles covering their worm-like bodies, lack eyes, and have mouth parts adapted to chewing. The larvae feed on organic matter, especially the feces of mature fleas, which contain dried blood. Adults feed only on fresh blood.

===Jumping===
Their legs are long, the hind pair well adapted for jumping; a flea can jump vertically up to and horizontally up to , making the flea one of the best jumpers of all known animals (relative to body size), second only to the froghopper. A flea can jump 60 times its length in height and 110 times its length in distance, equivalent to a adult human jumping vertically and horizontally. Rarely do fleas jump from dog to dog. Most flea infestations come from newly developed fleas from the pet&#x27;s environment. The flea jump is so rapid and forceful that it exceeds the capabilities of muscle, and instead of relying on direct muscle power, fleas store muscle energy in a pad of the elastic protein named resilin before releasing it rapidly (like a human using a bow and arrow). Immediately before the jump, muscles contract and deform the resilin pad, slowly storing energy which can then be released extremely rapidly to power leg extension for propulsion. To prevent premature release of energy or motions of the leg, the flea employs a &quot;catch mechanism&quot;. Early in the jump, the tendon of the primary jumping muscle passes slightly behind the coxa-trochanter joint, generating a torque which holds the joint closed with the leg close to the body. To trigger jumping, another muscle pulls the tendon forward until it passes the joint axis, generating the opposite torque to extend the leg and power the jump by release of stored energy. The actual take off has been shown by high-speed video to be from the tibiae and tarsi rather than from the trochantera (knees).

== Life cycle and development ==
Fleas are holometabolous insects, going through the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). In most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed on blood before they become capable of reproduction. The first blood meal triggers the maturation of the ovaries in females and the dissolution of the testicular plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their activities with their hosts&#x27; life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.

=== Egg ===
The number of eggs laid depends on species, with batch sizes ranging from two to several dozen. The total number of eggs produced in a female&#x27;s lifetime (fecundity) varies from around one hundred to several thousand. In some species, the flea lives in the host&#x27;s nest or burrow and the eggs are deposited on the substrate, but in others, the eggs are laid on the host itself and can easily fall off onto the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps become one of the primary habitats of eggs and developing larvae. The eggs take around two days to two weeks to hatch.

=== Larva ===
Flea larvae emerge from the eggs to feed on any available organic material such as dead insects, faeces, conspecific eggs, and vegetable matter. In laboratory studies, some dietary diversity seems necessary for proper larval development. Blood-only diets allow only 12% of larvae to mature, whereas blood and yeast or dog chow diets allow almost all larvae to mature. Another study also showed that 90% of larvae matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs. They are blind and avoid sunlight, keeping to dark, humid places such as sand or soil, cracks and crevices, under carpets and in bedding. The entire larval stage lasts between four and 18 days.

=== Pupa ===
Given an adequate supply of food, larvae pupate and weave silken cocoons after three larval stages. Within the cocoon, the larva molts for a final time and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. This can take just four days, but may take much longer under adverse conditions, and there follows a variable-length stage during which the pre-emergent adult awaits a suitable opportunity to emerge. Trigger factors for emergence include vibrations (including sound), heat (in warm-blooded hosts), and increased levels of carbon dioxide, all of which may indicate the presence of a suitable host. Large numbers of pre-emergent fleas may be present in otherwise flea-free environments, and the introduction of a suitable host may trigger a mass emergence.

=== Adult ===
Once the flea reaches adulthood, its primary goal is to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, permitting rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea&#x27;s life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live for up to a year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea&#x27;s life cycle are and optimum humidity is 70%.

Adult female rabbit fleas, &quot;Spilopsyllus cuniculi&quot;, can detect the changing levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit&#x27;s blood that indicate it is getting close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make their way back to the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
=== History ===
Between 1735 and 1758, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first classified insects, doing so on the basis of their wing structure. One of the seven orders into which he divided them was &quot;Aptera&quot;, meaning wingless, a group in which as well as fleas, he included spiders, woodlice and myriapods. It wasn&#x27;t until 1810 that the French zoologist Pierre André Latreille reclassified the insects on the basis of their mouthparts as well as their wings, splitting Aptera into Thysanura (silverfish), Anoplura (sucking lice) and Siphonaptera (fleas), at the same time separating off the arachnids and crustaceans into their own subphyla. The group&#x27;s name, Siphonaptera, is zoological Latin from the Greek &quot;siphon&quot; (a tube) and &quot;aptera&quot; (wingless).

=== External phylogeny ===
It was historically unclear whether the Siphonaptera are sister to the Mecoptera (scorpionflies and allies), or are inside that clade, making &quot;Mecoptera&quot; paraphyletic. The earlier suggestion that the Siphonaptera are sister to the Boreidae (snow scorpionflies) is not supported. A 2020 genetic study recovered Siphonaptera within Mecoptera, with strong support, as the sister group to Nannochoristidae, a small, relictual group of mecopterans native to the Southern Hemisphere. Fleas and nannochoristids share several similarities with each other that are not shared with other mecopterans, including similar mouthparts as well as a similar sperm pump organisation.

Relationships of Siphonaptera per Tihelka et al. 2020.

=== Fossil history ===

Fleas likely descended from scorpionflies, insects that are predators or scavengers. Fossils of large, wingless stem-group fleas with siphonate (sucking) mouthparts from the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous have been found in northeastern China and Russia, belonging to the families Saurophthiridae and Pseudopulicidae, as well as &quot;Tarwinia&quot; from the Early Cretaceous of Australia. Most flea families formed after the end of the Cretaceous (in the Paleogene and onwards). Modern fleas probably arose in the southern continental area of Gondwana, and migrated rapidly northwards from there. They most likely evolved with mammal hosts, only later moving to birds.

Siphonaptera is a relatively small order of insects: members of the order undergo complete metamorphosis and are secondarily wingless (their ancestors had wings which modern forms have lost). In 2005, Medvedev listed 2005 species in 242 genera, and despite subsequent descriptions of new species, bringing the total up to around 2500 species, this is the most complete database available. The order is divided into four infraorders and eighteen families. Some families are exclusive to a single host group; these include the Malacopsyllidae (armadillos), Ischnopsyllidae (bats) and Chimaeropsyllidae (elephant shrews).

Many of the known species are little studied. Some 600 species (a quarter of the total) are known from single records. Over 94% of species are associated with mammalian hosts, and only about 3% of species can be considered to be specific parasites of birds. The fleas on birds are thought to have originated from mammalian fleas; at least sixteen separate groups of fleas switched to avian hosts during the evolutionary history of the Siphonaptera. Occurrences of fleas on reptiles is accidental, and fleas have been known to feed on the hemolymph (bloodlike body fluid) of ticks.

=== Internal phylogeny ===
Flea phylogeny was long neglected, the discovery of homologies with the parts of other insects being made difficult by their extreme specialization. Whiting and colleagues prepared a detailed molecular phylogeny in 2008, with the basic structure shown in the cladogram. The Hectopsyllidae, including the harmful chigoe flea or jigger, is sister to the rest of the Siphonaptera.

==Taxonomy==
, there are 21 recognized families within the order Siphonaptera, 3 of which are extinct. In addition, some researchers have suggested that the subfamily Stenoponiinae should be elevated to its own family (Stenoponiidae).

== Relationship with host ==
Fleas feed on a wide variety of warm-blooded vertebrates including dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice, birds, and sometimes humans. Fleas normally specialise in one host species or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. &quot;Ceratophyllus gallinae&quot; affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of relatedness of a potential host to the flea&#x27;s original host, it has been shown that avian fleas that exploit a range of hosts, only parasitise species with low immune responses. In general, host specificity decreases as the size of the host species decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to the flea to change host species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where the flea may never encounter another species, than it is in solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived host provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites.

Although there are species named dog fleas (&quot;Ctenocephalides canis&quot; Curtis, 1826) and cat fleas (&quot;Ctenocephalides felis&quot;), fleas are not always strictly species-specific. A study in Virginia examined 244 fleas from 29 dogs: all were cat fleas. Dog fleas had not been found in Virginia in more than 70 years, and may not even occur in the US, so a flea found on a dog in the United States is likely a cat flea (&quot;Ctenocephalides felis&quot;).

One theory of human hairlessness is that the loss of hair helped humans to reduce their burden of fleas and other ectoparasites.

=== Direct effects of bites ===

In many species, fleas are principally a nuisance to their hosts, causing an itching sensation which in turn causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen, irritating nodule to form on the epidermis at the site of each bite, with a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. This can lead to an eczematous itchy skin disease called flea allergy dermatitis, which is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to secondary hair loss as a result of frequent scratching and biting by the animal. They can also cause anemia in extreme cases.

=== As a vector ===
Fleas are vectors for viral, bacterial and rickettsial diseases of humans and other animals, as well as of protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit &quot;Rickettsia typhi&quot;, &quot;Rickettsia felis&quot;, &quot;Bartonella henselae&quot;, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry &quot;Hymenolepiasis&quot; tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (&quot;Tunga penetrans&quot;) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog fleas.

== Relationship with humans ==
===In literature and art===
Fleas have appeared in poetry, literature, music and art; these include Robert Hooke&#x27;s drawing of a flea under the microscope in his pioneering book &quot;Micrographia&quot; published in 1665, poems by Donne and Jonathan Swift, works of music by Giorgio Federico Ghedini and Modest Mussorgsky, a play by Georges Feydeau, a film by Charlie Chaplin, and paintings by artists such as Giuseppe Crespi, Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, and Georges de La Tour.

John Donne&#x27;s erotic metaphysical poem &quot;The Flea&quot;, published in 1633 after his death, uses the conceit of a flea, which has sucked blood from the male speaker and his female lover, as an extended metaphor for their sexual relationship. The speaker tries to convince a lady to sleep with him, arguing that if the mingling of their blood in the flea is innocent, then sex would be also.

The comic poem &quot;Siphonaptera&quot; was written in 1915 by the mathematician Augustus De Morgan, It describes an infinite chain of parasitism made of ever larger and ever smaller fleas.

===Flea circuses===
Flea circuses provided entertainment to nineteenth century audiences. These circuses, extremely popular in Europe from 1830 onwards, featured fleas dressed as humans or towing miniature carts, chariots, rollers or cannon. These devices were originally made by watchmakers or jewellers to show off their skill at miniaturization. A ringmaster called a &quot;professor&quot; accompanied their performance with a rapid circus patter.

===Carriers of plague===
Oriental rat fleas, &quot;Xenopsylla cheopis&quot;, can carry the coccobacillus &quot;Yersinia pestis.&quot; The infected fleas feed on rodent vectors of this bacterium, such as the black rat, &quot;Rattus rattus&quot;, and then infect human populations with the plague, as has happened repeatedly from ancient times, as in the Plague of Justinian in 541–542. Outbreaks killed up to 200 million people across Europe between 1346 and 1671. The Black Death pandemic between 1346 and 1353 likely killed over a third of the population of Europe.

Because fleas carry plague, they have seen service as a biological weapon. During World War II, the Japanese army dropped fleas infested with &quot;Y. pestis&quot; in China. The bubonic and septicaemic plagues are the most probable form of the plague that would spread as a result of a bioterrorism attack that used fleas as a vector.

===The Rothschild Collection===
The banker Charles Rothschild devoted much of his time to entomology, creating a large collection of fleas now in the Rothschild Collection at the Natural History Museum, London. He discovered and named the plague vector flea, &quot;Xenopsylla cheopis&quot;, also known as the oriental rat flea, in 1903. Using what was probably the world&#x27;s most complete collection of fleas of about 260,000 specimens (representing some 73% of the 2,587 species and subspecies so far described), he described around 500 species and subspecies of Siphonaptera. He was followed in this interest by his daughter Miriam Rothschild, who helped to catalogue his enormous collection of the insects in seven volumes.

=== Flea treatments ===
Fleas have a significant economic impact. In America alone, approximately $2.8 billion is spent annually on flea-related veterinary bills and another $1.6 billion annually for flea treatment with pet groomers. Four billion dollars is spent annually for prescription flea treatment and $348 million for flea pest control.

<text>A principality (or sometimes princedom) is a type of monarchical state or feudal territory ruled by a prince or princess. It can be either a sovereign state or a constituent part of a larger political entity. The term &quot;principality&quot; is often used to describe small monarchies, particularly those in Europe, where the ruler holds the title of prince or an equivalent.

Historically, principalities emerged during the Middle Ages as part of the feudal system, where local princes gained significant power within a king&#x27;s domain. This led to political fragmentation and the creation of mini-states. Over time, many of these principalities consolidated into larger kingdoms and empires, while others retained their independence and prospered.

Sovereign principalities which exist today include Liechtenstein, Monaco, and the co-principality of Andorra. Additionally, some royal primogenitures, such as Asturias in Spain, are styled as principalities. The term is also used generically for small monarchies ruled by a monarch of a lesser rank than a king, such as a grand duke.

Principalities have played a significant role in European history, particularly within the Holy Roman Empire, and have fallen out of favour with the development of nationalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. The concept of a principality has also been applied in various forms across different regions and historical periods.

==Terminology==
Most of these states have historically been a polity, but in some occasions were rather territories in respect of which a princely title is held. The prince&#x27;s estate and wealth may be located mainly or wholly outside the geographical confines of the principality.

Generally recognised surviving sovereign principalities are Liechtenstein, Monaco, and the co-principality of Andorra. Extant royal primogenitures styled as principalities include Asturias (Spain). The Principality of Wales existed in the northern and western areas of Wales between the 13th and 16th centuries; the &quot;Laws in Wales Act 1535&quot; which legally incorporated Wales within England removed the distinction between those areas and the March of Wales. 

The Principality of Catalonia was a state located in the north-eastern area of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France between the late 12th and early 18th centuries, as the term for the political entity ruled by the Catalan Courts (the parliament) as a member of the composite monarchy of the Crown of Aragon, until the defeat of the Habsburgs in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), when these institutions were abolished by the Bourbons due to their support for the Habsburg pretender. &quot;Principality of Asturias&quot; is the official name of autonomous community of Asturias, however, the term &quot;Principality of Catalonia&quot; or simply &quot;Principality&quot; remains in popular and informal contexts to refer to the autonomous community of Catalonia.

The term &quot;principality&quot; is also sometimes used generically for any small monarchy, especially for small sovereign states ruled by a monarch of a lesser rank than a king, such as a Fürst (usually translated in English as &quot;prince&quot;), as in Liechtenstein, or a Grand Duke. No sovereign duchy currently exists, but Luxembourg is a surviving example of a sovereign grand duchy. Historically there have been sovereign principalities with many styles of ruler, such as Countship, Margraviate and even Lordship, especially within the Holy Roman Empire.

While the preceding definition would seem to fit a princely state perfectly, the European historical tradition is to reserve that word for native monarchies in colonial countries, and to apply &quot;principality&quot; to the European monarchies.

==European==
===Development===
Though principalities existed in antiquity, even before the height of the Roman Empire, the principality as it is known today developed in the Middle Ages between 750 and 1450 when feudalism was the primary economic and social system in much of Europe. Feudalism increased the power of local princes within a king&#x27;s lands. As princes continued to gain more power over time, the authority of the king was diminished in many places. This led to political fragmentation as the king&#x27;s lands were broken into mini-states ruled by princes and dukes who wielded absolute power over their small territories. This was especially prevalent in Europe, and particularly with the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire.

During the Late Middle Ages from 1200 to 1500, principalities were often at war with each other as royal houses asserted sovereignty over smaller principalities. These wars caused a great deal of instability and economies were destroyed. Episodes of bubonic plague also reduced the power of principalities to survive independently. Eventually, agricultural progress and development of new trade goods and services boosted commerce between principalities. Many of these states became wealthy, expanded their territories and improved the services provided to their citizens. Princes and dukes developed their lands, established new ports and chartered large thriving cities. Some used their new-found wealth to build palaces and other institutions now associated with sovereign states.

===Consolidation===

While some principalities prospered in their independence, less successful states were swallowed by stronger royal houses. Europe saw consolidation of small principalities into larger kingdoms and empires. This had already happened in England in the first millennium, and this trend subsequently led to the creation of such states as France, Portugal, and Spain. Another form of consolidation was orchestrated in Italy during the Renaissance by the Medici family. A banking family from Florence, the Medici took control of governments in various Italian regions and even assumed the papacy. They then appointed family members as princes and assured their protection. Prussia also later expanded by acquiring the territories of many other states.

However, in the 17th to 19th centuries, especially within the Holy Roman Empire, the reverse was also occurring: many new small sovereign states arose as a result of transfers of land for various reasons.

Notable principalities existed until the early 20th century in various regions of Germany and Italy.

===Nationalism===
Nationalism, the belief that the nation-state is the best vehicle to realise the aspirations of a people, became popular in the late 19th century. A characteristic of nationalism is an identity with a larger region such as an area sharing a common language and culture. With this development, principalities fell out of favour. As a compromise, many principalities united with neighbouring regions and adopted constitutional forms of government, with the monarch acting as a mere figurehead while administration was left in the hands of elected parliaments. The trend in the 19th and 20th centuries was the abolition of various forms of monarchy and the creation of republican governments led by popularly elected presidents.

===Ecclesiastical principalities===

Several principalities where genealogical inheritance is replaced by succession in a religious office have existed in the Roman Catholic Church, in each case consisting of a feudal polity (often a former secular principality in the broad sense) held &quot;ex officio&quot; — the closest possible equivalent to hereditary succession — by a prince of the church, styled more precisely according to his ecclesiastical rank, such as prince-bishop, prince-abbot or, especially as a form of crusader state, grand master.

Some of these instances were merely religious offices without sovereign power over any territory, while others, such as Salzburg and Durham, shared some of the characteristics of secular princes.

==Asia==
Prior to the European colonialism, South Asia and South East Asia were under the influence of the Indosphere, where numerous Indianized principalities and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam. The influence of Indian culture into these areas was given the term &quot;indianization&quot;. George Coedes defined it as the expansion of an organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, Hinduism and Buddhism and the Sanskrit dialect. This can be seen in the spread of Hinduism and Buddhism. Indian honorifics also influenced the Malay, Thai, Filipino and Indonesian honorifics.

In the colonial context, the term princely states was used, especially for those that came under the sway of a European colonising power: for example the British Indian and neighbouring or associated (e.g., Arabian) princely states were ruled by monarchs called Princes by the British, regardless of the native styles, which could be equivalent to royal or even imperial rank in the Indigenous cultures.

==Other principalities==
===Other===
Principalities have also existed in ancient and modern civilizations of Africa, Pre-Columbian America and Oceania.

===Micronational principalities===
Several micronations, which &quot;de facto&quot; have few characteristics of sovereign states and are not recognized as such, more or less seriously claim the status of sovereign principalities. Examples are Sealand, a former military fort in the North Sea; Seborga, internationally considered a small town in Italy; and Hutt River and Principality of Wy in Mosman, internationally considered to be in Australia.

<doc id="77323" wikidata="Q189366" url="?curid=77323" title="John Brown (abolitionist)">
<text>John Brown (May 9, 1800 – December 2, 1859) was an American abolitionist in the decades preceding the Civil War. First reaching national prominence in the 1850s for his radical abolitionism and fighting in Bleeding Kansas, Brown was captured, tried, and executed by the Commonwealth of Virginia for a raid and incitement of a slave rebellion at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in 1859.

An evangelical Christian of strong religious convictions, Brown was profoundly influenced by the Puritan faith of his upbringing. He believed that he was &quot;an instrument of God,&quot; raised to strike the &quot;death blow&quot; to slavery in the United States, a &quot;sacred obligation.&quot; Brown was the leading exponent of violence in the American abolitionist movement, believing it was necessary to end slavery after decades of peaceful efforts had failed. Brown said that in working to free the enslaved, he was following Christian ethics, including the Golden Rule, and the Declaration of Independence, which states that &quot;all men are created equal.&quot; He stated that in his view, these two principles &quot;meant the same thing.&quot;

Brown first gained national attention when he led anti-slavery volunteers and his sons during the Bleeding Kansas crisis of the late 1850s, a state-level civil war over whether Kansas would enter the Union as a slave state or a free state. He was dissatisfied with abolitionist pacifism, saying of pacifists, &quot;These men are all talk. What we need is actionaction!&quot; In May 1856, Brown and his sons killed five supporters of slavery in the Pottawatomie massacre, a response to the sacking of Lawrence by pro-slavery forces. Brown then commanded anti-slavery forces at the Battle of Black Jack and the Battle of Osawatomie.

In October 1859, Brown led a raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (which later became part of West Virginia), intending to start a slave liberation movement that would spread south; he had prepared a Provisional Constitution for the revised, slavery-free United States that he hoped to bring about. He seized the armory, but seven people were killed and ten or more were injured. Brown intended to arm slaves with weapons from the armory, but only a few slaves joined his revolt. Those of Brown&#x27;s men who had not fled were killed or captured by local militia and U.S. Marines, the latter led by Robert E. Lee. Brown was tried for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, the murder of five men, and inciting a slave insurrection. He was found guilty of all charges and was hanged on December 2, 1859, the first person executed for treason in the history of the United States.

The Harpers Ferry raid and Brown&#x27;s trial, both covered extensively in national newspapers, escalated tensions that in the next year led to the South&#x27;s long-threatened secession from the United States and the American Civil War. Southerners feared that others would soon follow in Brown&#x27;s footsteps, encouraging and arming slave rebellions. He was a hero and icon in the North. Union soldiers marched to the new song &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; that portrayed him as a heroic martyr. Brown has been variously described as a heroic martyr and visionary, and as a madman and terrorist.

==Early life and family==

===Family and childhood===

John Brown was born May 9, 1800, in Torrington, Connecticut, the son of Owen Brown (1771–1856) and Ruth Mills (1772–1808). Owen Brown&#x27;s father was Capt. John Brown, of English descent, who died in the Revolutionary War in New York on September 3, 1776.
His mother, of Dutch and Welsh descent, was the daughter of Gideon Mills, an officer in the Revolutionary Army.

Although Brown described his parents as &quot;poor but respectable&quot; at some point, Owen Brown became a leading and wealthy citizen of Hudson, Ohio. He operated a tannery and employed Jesse Grant, father of President Ulysses S. Grant. Jesse lived with the Brown family for some years. The founder of Hudson, David Hudson, with whom John&#x27;s father had frequent contact, was an abolitionist and an advocate of &quot;forcible resistance by the slaves.&quot;

The fourth child of Owen and Ruth, Brown&#x27;s other siblings included Anna Ruth (born in 1798), Salmon (born 1802), and Oliver Owen (born in 1804). Frederick, identified by Owen as his sixth son, was born in 1807. Frederick visited Brown when he was in jail, awaiting execution. He had an adopted brother, Levi Blakeslee (born some time before 1805). Salmon became a lawyer, politician, and newspaper editor.

While Brown was very young, his father moved the family briefly to his hometown, West Simsbury, Connecticut. In 1805, the family moved, again, to Hudson, Ohio, in the Western Reserve, which at the time was mostly wilderness; it became the most anti-slavery region of the country. Owen hated slavery and participated in Hudson&#x27;s anti-slavery activity and debate, offering a safe house to Underground Railroad fugitives. Owen became a supporter of Oberlin College after Western Reserve College would not allow a Black man to enroll. Owen was an Oberlin trustee from 1835 to 1844. Other Brown family members were abolitionists, but John and his eccentric brother Oliver were the most active and forceful.

John&#x27;s mother Ruth died a few hours after the death of a newborn girl in December 1808. In his memoir, Brown wrote that he mourned his mother for years. While he respected his father&#x27;s new wife, Sallie Root, he never felt an emotional bond with her. Owen married a third time to Lucy Hinsdale, a formerly married woman. Owen had a total of 6 daughters and 10 sons.

With no school beyond the elementary level in Hudson at that time, Brown studied at the school of the abolitionist Elizur Wright, father of the famous Elizur Wright, in nearby Tallmadge. In a story he told to his family, when he was 12 years old and away from home moving cattle, Brown worked for a man with a colored boy, who was beaten before him with an iron shovel. He asked the man why he was treated thus, and the answer was that he was a slave. According to Brown&#x27;s son-in-law Henry Thompson, it was that moment when John Brown decided to dedicate his life to improving African Americans&#x27; condition. As a child in Hudson, John got to know local Native Americans and learned some of their language. He accompanied them on hunting excursions and invited them to eat in his home.

=== Young adulthood ===
At 16, Brown left his family for New England to acquire a liberal education and become a Gospel minister. He consulted and conferred with Jeremiah Hallock, then clergyman at Canton, Connecticut, whose wife was a relative of Brown&#x27;s, and as advised proceeded to Plainfield, Massachusetts, where, under the instruction of Moses Hallock, he prepared for college. He would have continued at Amherst College, but he suffered from inflammation of the eyes which ultimately became chronic and precluded further studies. He returned to Ohio.

Back in Hudson, Brown taught himself surveying from a book. He worked briefly at his father&#x27;s tannery before opening a successful tannery outside of town with his adopted brother Levi Blakeslee. The two kept bachelor&#x27;s quarters, and Brown was a good cook. He had his bread baked by a widow, Mrs. Amos Lusk. As the tanning business had grown to include journeymen and apprentices, Brown persuaded her to take charge of his housekeeping. She and her daughter Dianthe moved into his log cabin. Brown married Dianthe in 1820. There is no known picture of her, but he described Dianthe as &quot;a remarkably plain, but neat, industrious and economical girl, of excellent character, earnest piety, and practical common sense&quot;. Their first child, John Jr., was born 13 months later. During 12 years of married life Dianthe gave birth to seven children, among them Owen, and died from complications of childbirth in 1832.

Brown knew the Bible thoroughly and could catch even small errors in Bible recitation. He never used tobacco nor drank tea, coffee, or alcohol. After the Bible, his favorite books were the series of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;. He enjoyed reading about Napoleon and Oliver Cromwell. He felt that &quot;truly successful men&quot; were those with their own libraries.

===Pennsylvania===

Brown left Hudson, Ohio, where he had a successful tannery, to be better situated to operate a safe and productive Underground Railroad station. He moved to Richmond Township in Crawford County, Pennsylvania, in 1825 and lived there until 1835, longer than he did anywhere else. He bought of land, cleared an eighth of it, and quickly built a cabin, a two-story tannery with 18 vats, and a barn; in the latter was a secret, well-ventilated room to hide escaping slaves. He transported refugees across the state border into New York and to an important Underground Railroad connection in Jamestown, about from Richmond Township. The escapees were hidden in the wagon he used to move the mail, hides for his tannery, and survey equipment. For ten years, his farm was an important stop on the Underground Railroad, during which, it is estimated to have helped 2,500 enslaved people on their journey to Canada, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development. Brown recruited other Underground Railroad stationmasters to strengthen the network.

Brown made money surveying new roads. He was involved in erecting a school, which first met in his home—he was its first teacher—, and attracting a preacher for a Congregational Society in Richmond. Their first meetings were held at the farm and tannery compound. He also helped to establish a post office, and in 1828 President John Quincy Adams named him the first postmaster of Randolph Township, Pennsylvania; he was reappointed by President Andrew Jackson, serving until he left Pennsylvania in 1835. He carried the mail for some years from Meadville, Pennsylvania, through Randolph to Riceville, some . He paid a fine at Meadville for declining to serve in the militia. During this period, Brown operated an interstate cattle and leather business along with a kinsman, Seth Thompson, from eastern Ohio. In 1829, some white families asked Brown to help them drive off Native Americans who hunted annually in the area. Calling it a mean act, Brown declined, even saying &quot;I would sooner take my gun and help drive you out of the country.&quot;
In 1831, Brown&#x27;s son Frederick (I) died, at the age of 4. Brown fell ill, and his businesses began to suffer, leaving him in severe debt. In mid-1832, shortly after the death of a newborn son, his wife Dianthe also died, either in childbirth or as an immediate consequence of it. He was left with the children John Jr., Jason, Owen, Ruth and Frederick (II). On July 14, 1833, Brown married 17-year-old Mary Ann Day (1817–1884), originally from Washington County, New York; she was the younger sister of Brown&#x27;s housekeeper at the time. They eventually had 13 children, seven of whom were sons who worked with their father in the fight to abolish slavery.

===Back to Ohio===
In 1836, Brown moved his family from Pennsylvania to Franklin Mills, Ohio, where he taught Sunday school. He borrowed heavily to buy land in the area, including property along canals being built, and entered into a partnership with Zenas Kent to construct a tannery along the Cuyahoga River, though Brown left the partnership before the tannery was completed. Brown continued to work on the Underground Railroad.

Brown became a bank director and was estimated to be worth . Like many businessmen in Ohio, he invested too heavily in credit and state bonds and suffered great financial losses in the Panic of 1837. In one episode of property loss, Brown was jailed when he attempted to retain ownership of a farm by occupying it against the claims of the new owner. 
In November 1837, Elijah Parish Lovejoy was murdered in Alton, Illinois, for printing an abolitionist newspaper. Brown, deeply upset about the incident, became more militant in his behavior, comparable with Reverend Henry Highland Garnet. Brown publicly vowed after the incident: &quot;Here, before God, in the presence of these witnesses, from this time, I consecrate my life to the destruction of slavery!&quot; Brown objected to Black congregants being relegated to the balcony at his church in Franklin Mills. According to daughter Ruth Brown&#x27;s husband Henry Thompson, whose brother was killed at Harpers Ferry:

For three or four years he seemed to flounder hopelessly, moving from one activity to another without plan. He tried many different business efforts attempting to get out of debt. He bred horses briefly, but gave it up when he learned that buyers were using them as race horses. He did some surveying, farming, and tanning. Brown declared bankruptcy in federal court on September 28, 1842. In 1843, three of his children — Charles, Peter, Austin — died of dysentery.

From the mid-1840s, Brown had built a reputation as an expert in fine sheep and wool. For about one year, he ran Captain Oviatt&#x27;s farm, and he then entered into a partnership with Colonel Simon Perkins of Akron, Ohio, whose flocks and farms were managed by Brown and his sons. Brown eventually moved into a home with his family across the street from the Perkins Stone Mansion.

===Springfield, Massachusetts===

In 1846, Brown moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, as an agent for Ohio wool growers in their relations with New England manufacturers of woolen goods, but &quot;also as a means of developing his scheme of emancipation&quot;. The white leadership there, including &quot;the publisher of &quot;The Republican&quot;, one of the nation&#x27;s most influential newspapers, were deeply involved and emotionally invested in the anti-slavery movement&quot;.

Brown made connections in Springfield that later yielded financial support he received from New England&#x27;s great merchants, allowed him to hear and meet nationally famous abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth, and included, after passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, the foundation of the League of Gileadites. Brown&#x27;s personal attitudes evolved in Springfield, as he observed the success of the city&#x27;s Underground Railroad and made his first venture into militant, anti-slavery community organizing. In speeches, he pointed to the martyrs Elijah Lovejoy and Charles Turner Torrey as white people &quot;ready to help blacks challenge slave-catchers&quot;. In Springfield, Brown found a city that shared his own anti-slavery passions, and each seemed to educate the other. Certainly, with both successes and failures, Brown&#x27;s Springfield years were a transformative period of his life that catalyzed many of his later actions.

Two years before Brown&#x27;s arrival in Springfield, in 1844, the city&#x27;s African-American abolitionists had founded the Sanford Street Free Church, now known as St. John&#x27;s Congregational Church, which became one of the most prominent abolitionist platforms in the United States. From 1846 until he left Springfield in 1850, Brown was a member of the Free Church, where he witnessed abolitionist lectures by the likes of Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. In 1847, after speaking at the Free Church, Douglass spent a night speaking with Brown, after which Douglass wrote, &quot;From this night spent with John Brown in Springfield, Mass. [in] 1847, while I continued to write and speak against slavery, I became all the same less hopeful for its peaceful abolition.&quot; 

During Brown&#x27;s time in Springfield, he became deeply involved in transforming the city into a major center of abolitionism, and one of the safest and most significant stops on the Underground Railroad. Brown contributed to the 1848 republication, by his friend Henry Highland Garnet, of David Walker&#x27;s &quot;An Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World&quot; (1829), which he helped publicize.

Before Brown left Springfield in 1850, the United States passed the Fugitive Slave Act, a law mandating that authorities in free states aid in the return of escaped slaves and imposing penalties on those who aid in their escape. In response, Brown founded a militant group to prevent the recapture of fugitives, the League of Gileadites, operated by free Blacks—like the &quot;strong-minded, brave, and dedicated&quot; Eli Baptist, William Montague, and Thomas Thomas—who risked being caught by slave catchers and sold into slavery. Upon leaving Springfield in 1850, he instructed the League to act &quot;quickly, quietly, and efficiently&quot; to protect slaves that escaped to Springfieldwords that would foreshadow Brown&#x27;s later actions preceding Harpers Ferry. From Brown&#x27;s founding of the &quot;League of Gileadites&quot; onward, not one person was ever taken back into slavery from Springfield. 

His daughter Amelia died in 1846, followed by Emma in 1849.

===New York===
In 1848, bankrupt and having lost the family&#x27;s house, Brown heard of Gerrit Smith&#x27;s Adirondack land grants to poor black men, in so remote a location that Brown later called it Timbuctoo, and decided to move his family there to establish a farm where he could provide guidance and assistance to the blacks who were attempting to establish farms in the area. He bought from Smith land in the town of North Elba, New York (near Lake Placid), for $1 an acre ($2/ha). It has a magnificent view and has been called &quot;the highest arable spot of land in the State.&quot; After living with his family about two years in a small rented house, and returning for several years to Ohio, he had the current housenow a monument preserved by New York Statebuilt for his family, viewing it as a place of refuge for them while he was away. According to youngest son Salmon, &quot;frugality was observed from a moral standpoint, but one and all we were a well-fed, well-clad lot.&quot;

After he was executed on December 2, 1859, his widow took his body there for burial; the trip took five days, and he was buried on December 8. Watson&#x27;s body was located and buried there in 1882. In 1899 the remains of 12 of Brown&#x27;s other collaborators, including his son Oliver, were located and brought to North Elba. They could not be identified well enough for separate burials, so they are buried together in a single casket donated by the town of North Elba; there is a collective plaque there now. Since 1895, the John Brown Farm State Historic Site has been owned by New York State and is now a National Historic Landmark.

==Actions in Kansas==

Kansas Territory was in the midst of a state-level civil war from 1854 to 1860, referred to as the Bleeding Kansas period, between pro- and anti-slavery forces. From 1854 to 1856, there had been eight killings in Kansas Territory attributable to slavery politics. There had been no organized action by abolitionists against pro-slavery forces by 1856. The issue was to be decided by the voters of Kansas, but who these voters were was not clear; there was widespread voting fraud in favor of the pro-slavery forces, as a Congressional investigation confirmed.

===Move to Kansas===
Five of Brown&#x27;s sons — John Jr., Jason, Owen, Frederick, and Salmon — moved to Kansas Territory in the spring of 1855. Brown, his son Oliver, and his son-in-law Henry Thompson followed later that year with a wagon loaded with weapons and ammunition. Brown stayed with Florella (Brown) Adair and the Reverend Samuel Adair, his half-sister and her husband, who lived near Osawatomie. During that time, he rallied support to fight proslavery forces, and became the leader of the antislavery forces in Kansas.

===Pottawatomie===


Brown and the free-state settlers intended to bring Kansas into the union as a slavery-free state. After the winter snows thawed in 1856, the pro-slavery activists began a campaign to seize Kansas on their own terms. Brown was particularly affected by the sacking of Lawrence, the center of anti-slavery activity in Kansas, on May 21, 1856. A sheriff-led posse from Lecompton, the center of pro-slavery activity in Kansas, destroyed two abolitionist newspapers and the Free State Hotel. Only one man, a border ruffian, was killed. 

Preston Brooks&#x27;s May 22 caning of anti-slavery Senator Charles Sumner in the United States Senate, news of which arrived by newswire (telegraph), also fueled Brown&#x27;s anger. A pro-slavery writer, Benjamin Franklin Stringfellow, of the &quot;Squatter Sovereign&quot;, wrote that &quot;[pro-slavery forces] are determined to repel this Northern invasion, and make Kansas a slave state; though our rivers should be covered with the blood of their victims, and the carcasses of the abolitionists should be so numerous in the territory as to breed disease and sickness, we will not be deterred from our purpose&quot;. Brown was outraged by both the violence of the pro-slavery forces and what he saw as a weak and cowardly response by the antislavery partisans and the Free State settlers, whom he described as &quot;cowards, or worse&quot;.

The Pottawatomie massacre occurred during the night of May 24 and the morning of May 25, 1856. Under Brown&#x27;s supervision, his sons and other abolitionist settlers took from their residences and killed five &quot;professional slave hunters and militant pro-slavery&quot; settlers. The massacre was the match in the powderkeg that precipitated the bloodiest period in &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; history, a three-month period of retaliatory raids and battles in which 29 people died.

Henry Clay Pate, who was part of the sacking of Lawrence, was, either during or shortly before, commissioned as a Deputy United States Marshal. On hearing news of John Brown&#x27;s actions at the Pottawatomie Massacre, Pate set out with a band of thirty men to hunt Brown down. During the hunt for Brown, two of his sons (Jason and John Junior) were captured (either by Pate or another marshal), charged with murder, and thrown in irons. Brown and free-state militia gathered to confront Pate. Two of Pate&#x27;s men were captured, which led to the conflict on June 2.

===Palmyra and Osawatomie===
In the Battle of Black Jack of June 2, 1856, John Brown, nine of his followers, and 20 local men successfully defended a Free State settlement at Palmyra, Kansas, against an attack by Henry Clay Pate. Pate and 22 of his men were taken prisoner.

In August, a company of over 300 Missourians under the command of General John W. Reid crossed into Kansas and headed toward Osawatomie, intending to destroy the Free State settlements there and then march on Topeka and Lawrence. On the morning of August 30, 1856, they shot and killed Brown&#x27;s son Frederick and his neighbor David Garrison on the outskirts of Osawatomie. Brown, outnumbered more than seven to one, arranged his 38 men behind natural defenses along the road. Firing from cover, they managed to kill at least 20 of Reid&#x27;s men and wounded 40 more. Reid regrouped, ordering his men to dismount and charge into the woods. Brown&#x27;s small group scattered and fled across the Marais des Cygnes River. One of Brown&#x27;s men was killed during the retreat and four were captured. While Brown and his surviving men hid in the woods nearby, the Missourians plundered and burned Osawatomie. Though defeated, Brown&#x27;s bravery and military shrewdness in the face of overwhelming odds brought him national attention and made him a hero to many Northern abolitionists.

On September 7, Brown entered Lawrence to meet with Free State leaders and help fortify against a feared assault. At least 2,700 pro-slavery Missourians were once again invading Kansas. On September 14, they skirmished near Lawrence. Brown prepared for battle, but serious violence was averted when the new governor of Kansas, John W. Geary, ordered the warring parties to disarm and disband, and offered clemency to former fighters on both sides.

Brown had become infamous and federal warrants were issued for his arrest due to his actions in Kansas. He became careful of how he travelled and whom he stayed with across the country.

==Raid at Harpers Ferry==


===Brown&#x27;s plans===

Brown&#x27;s plans for a major attack on American slavery began long before the raid. According to his wife Mary, interviewed while her husband was awaiting his execution, Brown had been planning the attack for 20 years. Frederick Douglass noted that he made the plans before he fought in Kansas. For instance, he spent the years between 1842 and 1849 settling his business affairs, moving his family to the Negro community at Timbuctoo, New York, and organizing in his own mind an anti-slavery raid that would strike a significant blow against the entire slave system, running slaves off Southern plantations.

According to his first biographer James Redpath, &quot;for thirty years, he secretly cherished the idea of being the leader of a servile insurrection: the American Moses, predestined by Omnipotence to lead the servile nations in our Southern States to freedom.&quot; An acquaintance said: &quot;As Moses was raised up and chosen of God to deliver the Children of Israel out of Egyptian bondage, ...he was...fully convinced in his own mind that he was to be the instrument in the hands of God to effect the emancipation of the slaves.&quot;

Brown said that,
Brown kept his plans a secret, including the care he took not to share the plans with his men, according to Jeremiah Anderson, one of the participants in the raid. His son Owen, the only one who survived of Brown&#x27;s three participating sons, said in 1873 that he did not think his father wrote down the entire plan. He did discuss his plans at length, for over a day, with Frederick Douglass, trying unsuccessfully to persuade Douglass, a black leader, to accompany him to Harpers Ferry (which Douglass thought a suicidal mission that could not succeed).

===Preparations===
====Financial and political backing====
To attain financial backing and political support for the raid on Harpers Ferry, Brown spent most of 1857 meeting with abolitionists in Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut. Initially Brown returned to Springfield, where he received contributions, and also a letter of recommendation from a prominent and wealthy merchant, George Walker. Walker was the brother-in-law of Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, the secretary for the Massachusetts State Kansas Committee, who introduced Brown to several influential abolitionists in the Boston area in January 1857.
Amos Adams Lawrence, a prominent Boston merchant, secretly gave Brown a large amount of cash. William Lloyd Garrison, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Theodore Parker and George Luther Stearns, and Samuel Gridley Howe also supported Brown, although Garrison, a pacificist, disagreed about the need to use violence to end slavery.

Most of the money for the raid came from the &quot;Secret Six&quot;, Franklin B. Sanborn, Samuel G. Howe M.D., businessman George L. Stearns, real estate tycoon Gerrit Smith, transcendentalist and reforming minister of the Unitarian church Theodore Parker, and Unitarian minister Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Recent research has also highlighted the substantial contribution of Mary Ellen Pleasant, an African American entrepreneur and abolitionist, who donated $30,000 () toward the cause.

In Boston, he met Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Even with the Secret Six and other contributors, Brown had not collected all money needed to fund the raid. He wrote an appeal, &quot;Old Browns Farewell&quot;, to abolitionists in the east with some success.

In December 1857, an anti-slavery Mock Legislature, organized by Brown, met in Springdale, Iowa. On several of Brown&#x27;s trips across Iowa he preached at Hitchcock House, an Underground Railroad stop in Lewis, Iowa.

====&quot;Virginia scheme&quot;====

With a free-state victory in the October elections, Kansas was quiet. Brown made his men return to Iowa, where he told them tidbits of his Virginia scheme. In January 1858, Brown left his men in Springdale, Iowa, and set off to visit Frederick Douglass in Rochester, New York. There he discussed his plans with Douglass, and reconsidered Forbes&#x27; criticisms. Brown wrote a Provisional Constitution that would create a government for a new state in the region of his invasion. He then traveled to Peterboro, New York, and Boston to discuss matters with the Secret Six. In letters to them, he indicated that, along with recruits, he would go into the South equipped with weapons to do &quot;Kansas work&quot;. While in Boston making secret preparations for his operation on Harper&#x27;s Ferry, he was raising money for weapons that were manufactured in Connecticut. Abolitionist Chaplain Photius Fisk gave him a sizable donation and obtained his autograph which he later gave to the Kansas Historical Society.

Brown started to wear a beard, &quot;to change his usual appearance&quot;.

====Weapons====
The Massachusetts Committee pledged to provide 200 Sharps Rifles and ammunition, which were being stored at Tabor, Iowa. The rifles were originally intended for use by free-staters in Kansas. After negotiation between the officers of the Massachusetts Kansas Committee and the National Committee, the rifles were transferred to the Massachusetts Committee for use in the Harpers Ferry raid. Horatio N. Rust, a friend of Brown&#x27;s, helped acquire for 1,000 pikes for the intended slave rebellion.

Weapons were purchased and sent to Kennedy Farmhouse in Sharpsburg, Maryland, where they were stored. Brown&#x27;s plan was to make use of weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment stored at the armory, arsenal, and the rifle factory in Harpers Ferry. There were an estimated 100,000 muskets and rifles at the armory and arsenal complex at the time.

The more sophisticated weapons, like Sharps rifles and pistols, were to be used by Black and White officers. The remaining fighters would use spear-like pikes, shotguns, and muskets.

====Constitutional convention in Ontario====
Brown and 12 of his followers, including his son Owen, traveled to Chatham, Ontario, where he convened on May 10 a Constitutional Convention. The convention, with several dozen delegates including his friend James Madison Bell, was put together with the help of Dr. Martin Delany. One-third of Chatham&#x27;s 6,000 residents were fugitive slaves, and it was here that Brown was introduced to Harriet Tubman, who helped him recruit. The convention&#x27;s 34 blacks and 12 whites adopted Brown&#x27;s Provisional Constitution. Brown had long used the terminology of the Subterranean Pass Way from the late 1840s, so it is possible that Delany conflated Brown&#x27;s statements over the years. Regardless, Brown was elected commander-in-chief and named John Henrie Kagi his &quot;Secretary of War&quot;. Richard Realf was named &quot;Secretary of State&quot;. Elder Monroe, a black minister, was to act as president until another was chosen. A. M. Chapman was the acting vice president; Delany, the corresponding secretary. In 1859, &quot;A Declaration of Liberty by the Representatives of the Slave Population of the United States of America&quot; was written.

====Crisis====
While in New York City, Brown was introduced to Hugh Forbes, an English mercenary, who had experience as a military tactician fighting with Giuseppe Garibaldi. Concerned about Brown&#x27;s strategy, Forbes undermined and delayed the plans for the raid.

Although nearly all of the delegates signed the constitution, few volunteered to join Brown&#x27;s forces, although it will never be clear how many Canadian expatriates actually intended to join Brown because of a subsequent &quot;security leak&quot; that threw off plans for the raid, creating a hiatus in which Brown lost contact with many of the Canadian leaders. This crisis occurred when Hugh Forbes, Brown&#x27;s mercenary, tried to expose the plans to Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson and others. The Secret Six feared their names would be made public. Howe and Higginson wanted no delays in Brown&#x27;s progress, while Parker, Stearns, Smith and Sanborn insisted on postponement. Stearns and Smith were the major sources of funds, and their words carried more weight. To throw Forbes off the trail and invalidate his assertions, Brown returned to Kansas in June, and remained in that vicinity for six months. There he joined forces with James Montgomery, who was leading raids into Missouri.

====Continue to organize funds and forces====

On December 20, Brown led his own raid, in which he liberated 11 slaves, took captive two white men, and looted horses and wagons. The Governor of Missouri announced a reward of $3,000 () for his capture. On January 20, 1859, he embarked on a lengthy journey to take the liberated slaves to Detroit and then on a ferry to Canada. While passing through Chicago, Brown met with abolitionists Allan Pinkerton, John Jones, and Henry O. Wagoner who arranged and raised the fare for the passage to Detroit and purchased supplies for Brown. Jones&#x27;s wife and fellow abolitionist, Mary Jane Richardson Jones, provided new clothes for Brown and his men, including the garb Brown was hanged in six months later. On March 12, 1859, Brown met with Frederick Douglass and Detroit abolitionists George DeBaptiste, William Lambert, and others at William Webb&#x27;s house in Detroit to discuss emancipation. DeBaptiste proposed that conspirators blow up some of the South&#x27;s largest churches. The suggestion was opposed by Brown, who felt humanity precluded such unnecessary bloodshed.

Over the course of the next few months, he traveled again through Ohio, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts to drum up more support for the cause. On May 9, he delivered a lecture in Concord, Massachusetts, that Amos Bronson Alcott, Emerson, and Thoreau attended. Brown reconnoitered with the Secret Six. 
As he began recruiting supporters for an attack on slaveholders, Brown was joined by Harriet Tubman, &quot;General Tubman&quot;, as he called her. Her knowledge of support networks and resources in the border states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware was invaluable to Brown and his planners. She also raised funds for Brown.

Some abolitionists, including Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison, opposed his tactics, but Brown dreamed of fighting to create a new state for freed slaves and made preparations for military action. After he began the first battle, he believed, slaves would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the South.

===Brown&#x27;s forces===
The men that fought with Brown in Kansas gathered at Springdale, Iowa, a Quaker settlement, about January 1858, to prepare to execute Brown&#x27;s Virginia scheme.

In June, Brown paid his last visit to his family in North Elba before departing for Harpers Ferry. He stayed one night en route in Hagerstown, Maryland, at the Washington House, on West Washington Street. On June 30, 1859, the hotel had at least 25 guests, including I. Smith and Sons, Oliver Smith and Owen Smith, and Jeremiah Anderson, all from New York. From papers found in the Kennedy Farmhouse after the raid, it is known that Brown wrote to Kagi that he would sign into a hotel as I. Smith and Sons.

The men who prepared for the raid at Kennedy Farmhouse and participated in the raid with Brown included two groups of men:

:A group that fought with him in Kansas and gathered at Springdale, Iowa, to prepare and drill for the raid,
:* Jeremiah Goldsmith Anderson, 26, born in Indiana, served with Brown in Kansas, killed in the raid.
:* Oliver Brown, 20, John Brown&#x27;s son, served in Kansas. He was mortally wounded during the raid.
:* Owen Brown, about 35, John Brown&#x27;s son, fought in Kansas. He escaped the raid.
:* John E. Cook, 29, reformer and former soldier, attended Oberlin College, he initially escaped capture, but was found and hanged.
:* Albert Hazlett, 23, fought in Kansas, escaped following the raid, but was captured and hanged.
:* John Henry Kagi, about 24, a teacher, became Brown&#x27;s second in command. Before the raid he printed copies of Brown&#x27;s constitution in a printing shop he established in Hamilton, Ontario. He was mortally wounded during the raid.
:* William H. Leeman, 20, fought with the free-staters in Kansas for three years, beginning at the age of 17. He died during the raid.
:* Aaron Dwight Stevens, about 28, was a former soldier and fighter in Kansas, who gave the men military training and drills. He was wounded during the raid, after which he was executed.
:* Charles Plummer Tidd, 25, fought in Kansas. He escaped the raid and later served during the Civil War.

:Men he met when rounding up recruits for the raid:
:* Watson Brown, son of John Brown, mortally wounded during the raid.
:* John Anthony Copeland Jr. was a free black man who joined John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry. He was captured during the raid and was executed.
:* Barclay Coppoc, 19, escaped capture following the raid. He fought in the Civil War.
:* Edwin Coppoc, 24, captured and hanged.
:* Shields Green, about 23, escaped slavery, captured and hanged.
:* Lewis Sheridan Leary, a harness maker freed by his white father, mortally wounded during the raid.
:* Francis Jackson Meriam, 22, grandson of Francis Jackson who was a leader of Antislavery Societies. Meriam was an aristocrat. He escaped during the raid. Meriam led an African American infantry group during the Civil War.
:* Dangerfield Newby, 44, born a slave, escaped slavery, returned to Virginia to fight in the raid, where he was killed.
:* Stewart Taylor, 23, a wagonmaker from Canada, mortally wounded during the raid.
:* Dauphin Thompson, 21, married to Ruth Brown, John Brown&#x27;s daughter, mortally wounded during the raid.
:* William Thompson, 26, mortally wounded during the raid.
They were at Kennedy Farmhouse, four to five miles away from Harpers Ferry. Brown&#x27;s daughter and daughter-in-law, Anne and Martha, Oliver&#x27;s wife, prepared food and kept the house for the men from August and throughout the month of September.

===The raid===
Brown led his forces for Harper Ferry on the night of October 16, 1859. The objective was to take the armory, the arsenal, the town, and then the rifle factory. Then, they wanted to free all the slaves in Harpers Ferry. After that, they would move south with those newly freed people who wanted to join the fight to free other enslaved people. Brown told his men to take prisoners who disobeyed them and to fight only in self-defense. 

Initially, they met no resistance entering the town. John Brown&#x27;s raiders cut the telegraph wires and easily captured the armory, which was being defended by a single watchman. They next rounded up hostages from nearby farms, including Colonel Lewis Washington, great-grandnephew of George Washington. They also spread the news to the local slaves that their liberation was at hand.

When an eastbound Baltimore and Ohio Railroad train approached the town, Brown held it and then inexplicably allowed it to continue on its way. At the next station where the telegraph still worked, the conductor sent a telegram to B&amp;O headquarters in Baltimore. The railroad sent telegrams to President Buchanan and Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise.
By the morning of October 18 the engine house, later known as John Brown&#x27;s Fort, was surrounded by a company of U.S. Marines under the command of First Lieutenant Israel Greene, USMC, with Colonel Robert E. Lee of the United States Army in overall command.

Army First Lieutenant J. E. B. Stuart approached the engine-house to apprehend Brown and told the raiders their lives would be spared if they surrendered. Brown refused, saying, &quot;No, I prefer to die here.&quot; Stuart then gave a signal and the Marines used sledgehammers and a makeshift battering ram to break down the engine room door. Lieutenant Israel Greene cornered Brown and struck him several times, wounding his head. In three minutes, Brown and the survivors were captives.

Altogether, Brown&#x27;s men killed four townspeople and one Marine. Ten people were wounded, one of whom was a Marine. Four of Brown&#x27;s men were not captured, the rest died during the raid or were captured and executed. Among the raiders killed were John Henry Kagi, Lewis Sheridan Leary, and Dangerfield Newby; those hanged besides Brown included John Copeland, Edwin Coppock, Aaron Stevens, and Shields Green. Most of the enslaved people were returned to their slaveholders, while some were able to escape capture. A man named Phil was captured with Brown, and a man named Jim drowned in the Shenandoah.

Brown and the others captured were held in the office of the armory. On October 18, 1859, Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise, Virginia Senator James M. Mason, and Representative Clement Vallandigham of Ohio arrived in Harpers Ferry. Brown conceded that he did not receive the support he expected from White and Black people. The questioning lasted several hours.

==The trial==



Brown was charged with treason and tried in a Virginia state court at Governor Wise&#x27;s request. Accordingly, the charge was treason against Virginia. President Buchanan did not object.

Brown was tried with his men who had lived through the raid and had not escaped — Copeland, Coppoc, Green, and Stevens — on charges of murder, &quot;conspiracy to foment a slave insurrection&quot;, and treason, as of October 26.

On November 2, after a week-long trial in Charles Town, the county seat of Jefferson County, and 45 minutes of deliberation, the jury found Brown guilty on all three counts. He was sentenced to be hanged in public on December 2.
He was the first person executed for treason in the history of the United States.

The trial attracted reporters who were able to send their articles via the new telegraph. They were reprinted in numerous papers. It was the first trial in the U.S. to be nationally reported.

===November 2 to December 2, 1859===
Before his conviction, reporters were not allowed access to Brown, as the judge and Andrew Hunter feared that his statements, if quickly published, would exacerbate tensions, especially among the enslaved. This was much to Brown&#x27;s frustration, as he stated that he wanted to make a full statement of his motives and intentions through the press. Once he had been convicted, the restriction was lifted, and, glad for the publicity, he talked with reporters and anyone else who wanted to see him, except pro-slavery clergy. Brown received more letters than he ever had in his life. He wrote replies constantly, hundreds of eloquent letters, often published in newspapers.

===Rescue and Victor Hugo&#x27;s pardon plans===
There were well-documented and specific plans to rescue Brown, as Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise wrote to President Buchanan. Throughout the weeks Brown and six of his collaborators were in the Jefferson County Jail in Charles Town, the town was filled with various types of troops and militia, hundreds and sometimes thousands of them. Brown&#x27;s trips from the jail to the courthouse and back, and especially the short trip from the jail to the gallows, were heavily guarded. Wise halted all non-military transportation on the Winchester and Potomac Railroad (from Maryland south through Harpers Ferry to Charles Town and Winchester), from the day before through the day after the execution. Jefferson County was under martial law, and the military orders in Charles Town for the execution day had 14 points.

However, Brown said several times that he did not want to be rescued. He refused the assistance of Silas Soule, a friend from Kansas who infiltrated the Jefferson County Jail one day by getting himself arrested for drunken brawling and offered to break him out during the night and flee northward to New York State and possibly Canada. Brown told Silas that, aged 59, he was too old to live a life on the run from the federal authorities as a fugitive and wanted to accept his execution as a martyr for the abolitionist cause. As Brown wrote his wife and children from jail, he believed that his &quot;blood will do vastly more towards advancing the cause I have earnestly endeavoured to promote, than all I have done in my life before.&quot; &quot;I am worth inconceivably more to hang than for any other purpose.&quot;

Victor Hugo, from exile on Guernsey, tried to obtain a pardon for John Brown: he sent an open letter that was published by the press on both sides of the Atlantic. This text, written at Hauteville House on December 2, 1859, warned of a possible civil war:

The letter was initially published in the &quot;London News&quot; and was widely reprinted. After Brown&#x27;s execution, Hugo wrote a number of additional letters about Brown and the abolitionist cause.

Abolitionists in the United States saw Hugo&#x27;s writings as evidence of international support for the anti-slavery cause. The most widely publicized commentary on Brown to reach America from Europe was an 1861 pamphlet, &quot;John Brown par Victor Hugo&quot;, that included a brief biography and reprinted two letters by Hugo, including that of December 9, 1859. The pamphlet&#x27;s frontispiece was an engraving of a hanged man by Hugo that became widely associated with the execution.

==Last words, death and aftermath==
On December 1, 1859, Mary Ann Brown, who had stayed away from the prison due to Brown&#x27;s concern for her safety, visited her husband for several hours with permission from Governor Wise.

On the day of his execution, December 2, Brown read his Bible and wrote a final letter to his wife, which included the will he had written the previous day, as large meetings were held in many cities in the Northeast. In many of the cases, &quot;Negroes were the chief actors in creating excitement&quot;.
Brown was well read and knew that the last words of prominent people are valued. That morning, Brown wrote and gave to his jailor Avis the words he wanted to be remembered by:

I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done.
At 11:00 a.m. Brown rode, sitting on his coffin in a furniture wagon, from the county jail through a crowd of 2,000 soldiers to a small field a few blocks away, where the gallows were. The military, prepared for an attack, lined the square where Brown was to be hanged, with &quot;the greatest array of disciplined forces ever seen in Virginia&quot;, according to Major Preston. Among the soldiers in the crowd were future Confederate general Stonewall Jackson, and John Wilkes Booth (the latter borrowing a militia uniform to gain admission to the execution).

Brown, who did not want to have a minister with him, displayed &quot;the most complete fearlessness of &amp; insensibility to danger &amp; death&quot; as he walked to the gallows. Brown was hanged at 11:15 a.m. and was pronounced dead 35 minutes later by the coroner.

The poet Walt Whitman, in &quot;Year of Meteors&quot;, described viewing the execution.

===Funeral and burial===


Brown&#x27;s desire, as told to the jailor in Charles Town, was that his body be burned, &quot;the ashes urned&quot;, and his dead sons disinterred and treated likewise. He wanted his epitaph to be:
However, according to the sheriff of Jefferson County, Virginia law did not allow the burning of bodies, and Mrs. Brown did not want it. Brown&#x27;s body was placed in a wooden coffin with the noose still around his neck, and the coffin was then put on a train to take it away from Virginia to his family homestead in North Elba, New York for burial.

His body needed to be prepared for burial; this was supposed to take place in Philadelphia. There were many Southern pro-slavery medical students and faculty in Philadelphia, and as a direct result, they left the city &quot;en masse&quot; on December 21, 1859, for Southern medical schools, never to return. When Mary and her husband&#x27;s body arrived on December 3, Philadelphia Mayor Alexander Henry met the train, with many policemen, and said public order could not be maintained if the casket remained in Philadelphia. In fact he &quot;made a fake casket, covered with flowers and flags[,] which was carefully lifted from the coach&quot;; the crowd followed the sham casket. The genuine casket was immediately sent onwards. It was transported through places special to Brown during his life. His corpse was transported via Troy, New York, Rutland, Vermont, and across Lake Champlain by boat. His corpse arrived at the Brown farm at North Elba, New York. Brown&#x27;s body was washed, dressed, and placed, with difficulty, in a walnut coffin, in New York. He was buried on December 8, 1859. Abolitionist Rev. Joshua Young gave a prayer, and James Miller McKim and Wendell Phillips spoke.

In the North, large memorial meetings took place, church bells rang, minute guns were fired, and famous writers such as Emerson and Thoreau joined many Northerners in praising Brown.

On July 4, 1860, family and admirers of Brown gathered at his farm for a memorial. This was the last time that the surviving members of Brown&#x27;s family gathered together. The farm was sold, except for the burial plot. By 1882, John Jr., Owen, Jason, and Ruth, widow of Henry Thompson, lived in Ohio; his wife and their two unmarried daughters in California. By 1886, Owen, Jason, and Ruth were living near Pasadena, California, where they were honored in a parade.

===Senate investigation===

On December 14, 1859, the U.S. Senate appointed a bipartisan committee to investigate the Harpers Ferry raid and to determine whether any citizens contributed arms, ammunition or money to John Brown&#x27;s men. The Democrats attempted to implicate the Republicans in the raid; the Republicans tried to disassociate themselves from Brown and his acts.

The Senate committee heard testimony from 32 witnesses, including Liam Dodson, one of the surviving abolitionists. The report, authored by chairman James Murray Mason, a pro-slavery Democrat from Virginia, was published in June 1860. It found no direct evidence of a conspiracy, but implied that the raid was a result of Republican doctrines. The two committee Republicans published a minority report, but were apparently more concerned about denying Northern culpability than clarifying the nature of Brown&#x27;s efforts. Republicans such as Abraham Lincoln rejected any connection with the raid, calling Brown &quot;insane&quot;.

The investigation was performed in a tense environment in both houses of Congress. One senator wrote to his wife that &quot;The members on both sides are mostly armed with deadly weapons and it is said that the friends of each are armed in the galleries.&quot; After a heated exchange of insults, a Mississippian attacked Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania with a Bowie knife in the House of Representatives. Stevens&#x27; friends prevented a fight.

The Senate committee was very cautious in its questions of two of Brown&#x27;s backers, Samuel Howe and George Stearns, out of fear of stoking violence. Howe and Stearns later said that the questions were asked in a manner that permitted them to give honest answers without implicating themselves. Civil War historian James M. McPherson stated that &quot;A historian reading their testimony, however, will be convinced that they told several falsehoods.&quot;

===Aftermath of the raid===

John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry was among the last in a series of events that led to the American Civil War. Southern slaveowners, hearing initial reports that hundreds of abolitionists were involved, were relieved the effort was so small, but feared other abolitionists would emulate Brown and attempt to lead slave rebellions. Future Confederate President Jefferson Davis feared &quot;thousands of John Browns&quot;. Therefore, the South reorganized the decrepit militia system. These militias, well-established by 1861, became a ready-made Confederate army, making the South better prepared for war.

Southern Democrats charged that Brown&#x27;s raid was an inevitable consequence of the political platform of what they invariably called &quot;the Black Republican Party&quot;. In light of the upcoming elections in November 1860, the Republicans tried to distance themselves as much as possible from Brown, condemning the raid and dismissing its leader as an insane fanatic. As one historian explains, Brown was successful in polarizing politics: &quot;Brown&#x27;s raid succeeded brilliantly. It drove a wedge through the already tentative and fragile Opposition–Republican coalition and helped to intensify the sectional polarization that soon tore the Democratic party and the Union apart.&quot;

Many abolitionists in the North viewed Brown as a martyr, sacrificed for the sins of the nation. Immediately after the raid, William Lloyd Garrison published a column in &quot;The Liberator&quot;, judging Brown&#x27;s raid &quot;well-intended but sadly misguided&quot; and &quot;wild and futile&quot;. However, he defended Brown&#x27;s character from detractors in the Northern and Southern press and argued that those who supported the principles of the American Revolution could not consistently oppose Brown&#x27;s raid. On the day Brown was hanged, Garrison reiterated the point in Boston: &quot;whenever commenced, I cannot but wish success to all slave insurrections&quot;.

Frederick Douglass believed that Brown&#x27;s &quot;zeal in the cause of my race was far greater than mineit was as the burning sun to my taper lightmine was bounded by time, his stretched away to the boundless shores of eternity. I could live for the slave, but he could die for him.&quot;

==Viewpoints==
===Contemporaries===

Between 1859 and Lincoln&#x27;s assassination in 1865, Brown was the most famous American: emblem to the North, as Wendell Phillips put it, and traitor to the South. According to Frederick Douglass, &quot;He was with the troops during that war, he was seen in every camp fire, and our boys pressed onward to victory and freedom, timing their feet to the stately stepping of Old John Brown as his soul went marching on.&quot; Douglass called him &quot;a brave and glorious old man. ...History has no better illustration of pure, disinterested benevolence.&quot;

Other black leaders of the timeMartin Delany, Henry Highland Garnet, Harriet Tubmanalso knew and respected Brown. &quot;Tubman thought Brown was the greatest white man who ever lived&quot;, and she said later he did more for American blacks than Lincoln did.

Black businesses across the North closed on the day of his execution. Church bells tolled across the North. In response to the death sentence, Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked that &quot;[John Brown] will make the gallows glorious like the Cross.&quot; In 1863, Julia Ward Howe wrote the popular hymn the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; to the tune of &quot;John Brown&#x27;s body&quot;, which included a line &quot;As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free&quot;, comparing Brown&#x27;s sacrifice to that of Jesus Christ.

Lincoln thought Brown had “shown great courage, rare unselfishness.” But, with most Americans of the day, Lincoln believed Brown had gone too far. “Old John Brown has just been executed for treason against the state. We cannot object,” Lincoln reasoned, “even though he agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong.&quot;

According to W. E. B. Du Bois in his 1909 biography, &quot;John Brown&quot;. Brown&#x27;s raid stood as &quot;a great white lightan unwavering, unflickering brightness, blinding by its all-seeing brilliance, making the whole world simply a light and a darknessa right and a wrong.&quot;

According to his friend and financier, the rich abolitionist Gerrit Smith, &quot;If I were asked to point out the man in all this world I think most truly a Christian, I would point to John Brown.&quot;

===Historians and other writers===
Writers continue to vigorously debate Brown&#x27;s personality, sanity, motivations, morality, and relation to abolitionism. Once the Reconstruction era had ended, with the country distancing itself from the anti-slavery cause, and martial law imposed in the South, the historical view of Brown changed. Historian James Loewen surveyed American history textbooks prior to 1995 and noted that until about 1890, historians considered Brown perfectly sane, but from about 1890 until 1970, he was generally portrayed as insane. Oswald Garrison Villard, the grandson of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, wrote a favorable 1910 biography of Brown, though it also added fuel to the anti-Brown fire by criticizing him as a muddled, pugnacious, bumbling, and homicidal madman. Villard himself was a pacifist and admired Brown in many respects, but his interpretation of the facts provided a paradigm for later anti-Brown writers. Similarly, a 1923 textbook stated, &quot;The farther we getaway from the excitement of 1859 the more we are disposed to consider this extraordinary man the victim of mental delusions.&quot; In 1978, NYU historian Albert Fried concluded that historians who portrayed Brown as a dysfunctional figure are &quot;really informing me of their predilections, their judgment of the historical event, their identification with the moderates and opposition to the &#x27;extremists.&#x27;&quot; This view of Brown has come to prevail in academic writing and in journalism. Biographer Louis DeCaro Jr. wrote in 2007, &quot;there is no consensus of fairness with respect to Brown in either the academy or the media.&quot; Biographer Stephen B. Oates has described Brown as &quot;maligned as a demented dreamer ... (but) in fact one of the most perceptive human beings of his generation&quot;.
Some writers describe Brown as a monomaniacal zealot, others as a hero. In 1931, the United Daughters of the Confederacy and Sons of Confederate Veterans erected a counter-monument, to Heyward Shepherd, a free black man who was the first fatality of the Harpers Ferry raid, claiming without evidence that he was a &quot;representative of Negroes of the neighborhood, who would not take part&quot;. By the mid-20th century, some scholars were fairly convinced that Brown was a fanatic and killer, while some African Americans sustained a positive view of him. According to Stephen Oates, &quot;unlike most Americans at his time, he had no racism. He treated blacks equally. ...He was a success, a tremendous success because he was a catalyst of the Civil War. He didn&#x27;t cause it but he set fire to the fuse that led to the blow up.&quot; Journalist Richard Owen Boyer considered Brown &quot;an American who gave his life that millions of other Americans might be free&quot;, and others held similarly positive views.

Some historians, such as Paul Finkelman, compare Brown to contemporary terrorists such as Osama bin Laden and Timothy McVeigh, Finkelman calling him &quot;simply part of a very violent world&quot; and further stating that Brown &quot;is a bad tactician, a bad strategist, he&#x27;s a bad planner, he&#x27;s not a very good generalbut he&#x27;s not crazy&quot;. Historian James Gilbert labels Brown a terrorist by 21st-century criteria. Gilbert writes: &quot;Brown&#x27;s deeds conform to contemporary definitions of terrorism, and his psychological predispositions are consistent with the terrorist model.&quot; In contrast, biographer David S. Reynolds gives Brown credit for starting the Civil War or &quot;killing slavery&quot;, and cautions others against identifying Brown with terrorism. Reynolds saw Brown as inspiring the Civil Rights Movement a century later, adding &quot;it is misleading to identify Brown with modern terrorists.&quot; Malcolm X said that white people could not join his black nationalist Organization of Afro-American Unity, but &quot;if John Brown were still alive, we might accept him&quot;.

In his posthumous &quot;The Impending Crisis, 1848–1861&quot; (1976), David Potter argued that the emotional effect of Brown&#x27;s raid exceeded the philosophical effect of the Lincoln–Douglas debates, and reaffirmed a deep division between North and South. Biographer Louis A. DeCaro Jr., who has debunked many historical allegations about Brown&#x27;s early life and public career, concludes that although he &quot;was hardly the only abolitionist to equate slavery with sin, his struggle against slavery was far more personal and religious than it was for many abolitionists, just as his respect and affection for black people was far more personal and religious than it was for most enemies of slavery&quot;. Historian and Brown documentary scholar Louis Ruchames wrote: &quot;Brown&#x27;s action was one of great idealism and placed him in the company of the great liberators of mankind.&quot;

Several 21st-century works about Brown are notable for the absence of hostility that characterized similar works a century earlier (when Lincoln&#x27;s anti-slavery views were de-emphasized). Journalist and documentary writer Ken Chowder considers Brown &quot;stubborn ... egoistical, self-righteous, and sometimes deceitful; yet ... at certain times, a great man&quot; and argues that Brown has been adopted by both the left and right, and his actions &quot;spun&quot; to fit the world view of the spinner at various times in American history. The shift to an appreciative perspective moves many white historians toward the view long held by black scholars such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Benjamin Quarles, and Lerone Bennett, Jr.

==Influences==
The connection between John Brown&#x27;s life and many of the slave uprisings in the Caribbean was clear from the outset. Brown was born during the period of the Haitian Revolution, which saw Haitian slaves revolting against the French. The role the revolution played in helping formulate Brown&#x27;s abolitionist views directly is not clear; however, the revolution had an obvious effect on the general view toward slavery in the northern United States, and in the Southern states, it was a warning of horror (as they viewed it) possibly to come. As W. E. B. Du Bois notes, the involvement of slaves in the American Revolutions, and the &quot;upheaval in Hayti, and the new enthusiasm for human rights, led to a wave of emancipation which started in Vermont during the Revolution and swept through New England and Pennsylvania, ending finally in New York and New Jersey&quot;.

The 1839 slave insurrection aboard the Spanish ship &quot;La Amistad&quot;, off the coast of Cuba, provides a poignant example of John Brown&#x27;s support and appeal toward Caribbean slave revolts. On &quot;La Amistad&quot;, Joseph Cinqué and approximately 50 other slaves captured the ship, slated to transport them from Havana to Puerto Príncipe, Cuba, in July 1839, and attempted to return to Africa. However, through trickery, the ship ended up in the United States, where Cinque and his men stood trial. Ultimately, the courts acquitted the men because at the time, the international slave trade was illegal in the United States. According to Brown&#x27;s daughter, &quot;Turner and Cinque stood first in esteem&quot; among Brown&#x27;s black heroes. Furthermore, she noted Brown&#x27;s &quot;admiration of Cinques&#x27; character and management in carrying his points with so little bloodshed!&quot; In 1850, Brown would refer affectionately to the revolt, in saying &quot;Nothing so charms the American people as personal bravery. Witness the case of Cinques, of everlasting memory, on board the &quot;Amistad&quot;.&quot;

The specific knowledge John Brown gained from the tactics employed in the Haitian Revolution, and other Caribbean revolts, was of paramount importance when Brown turned his sights to the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. As Brown&#x27;s cohort Richard Realf explained to a committee of the 36th Congress, &quot;he had posted himself in relation to the wars of Toussaint L&#x27;Ouverture; he had become thoroughly acquainted with the wars in Hayti and the islands round about.&quot; By studying the slave revolts of the Caribbean region, Brown learned a great deal about how to properly conduct guerilla warfare. A key element to the prolonged success of this warfare was the establishment of maroon communities, which are essentially colonies of runaway slaves. As a contemporary article notes, Brown would use these establishments to &quot;retreat from and evade attacks he could not overcome. He would maintain and prolong a guerilla war, of which ... Haiti afforded&quot; an example.

The idea of creating maroon communities was the impetus for the creation of John Brown&#x27;s &quot;Provisional Constitution and Ordinances for the People of the United States&quot;, which helped to detail how such communities would be governed. However, the idea of maroon colonies of slaves is not an idea exclusive to the Caribbean region. In fact, maroon communities riddled the southern United States between the mid-1600s and 1864, especially in the Great Dismal Swamp region of Virginia and North Carolina. Similar to the Haitian Revolution, the Seminole Wars, fought in modern-day Florida, saw the involvement of maroon communities, which although outnumbered by native allies were more effective fighters.

Although the maroon colonies of North America undoubtedly had an effect on John Brown&#x27;s plan, their impact paled in comparison to that of the maroon communities in places like Haiti, Jamaica, and Surinam. Accounts by Brown&#x27;s friends and cohorts prove this idea. Richard Realf, a cohort of Brown in Kansas, noted that Brown not only studied the slave revolts in the Caribbean, but focused more specifically on the maroons of Jamaica and those involved in Haiti&#x27;s liberation. Brown&#x27;s friend Richard Hinton similarly noted that Brown knew &quot;by heart&quot; the occurrences in Jamaica and Haiti. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a cohort of Brown&#x27;s and a member of the Secret Six, stated that Brown&#x27;s plan involved getting &quot;together bands and families of fugitive slaves&quot; and &quot;establish them permanently in those [mountain] fastnesses, like the Maroons of Jamaica and Surinam&quot;.

==Legacy==
Of all the major figures associated with the American Civil War, Brown is one of the most studied and pondered. &quot;As a nation, we are unable to get over John Brown.&quot; Kate Field raised money to give to the State of New York for what was to be, in her words, &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Grave and Farm&quot; (now John Brown Farm State Historic Site). At the centenary of the raid in 1959, a &quot;sanitized&quot; play about him was produced at Harper&#x27;s Ferry.

In 2007 Brown was inducted into the National Abolition Hall of Fame, in Peterboro, New York.

===John Brown Day===
* May 1: In 1999, John Brown Day was celebrated on May 1.
* May 7: In 2016, John Brown Lives! Friends of Freedom celebrated May 7 as John Brown Day. In 2018, it was May 5. Spirit of John Brown Freedom Awards were given to environmentalist Jen Kretser, poet Martín Espada, and to Soffiyah Elijah, attorney and executive director of the Alliance of Families for Justice, which advocates for prison reform. In 2022, the day chosen was May 14.
* May 9: The John Brown Farm, Tannery &amp; Museum, in Guys Mills, Pennsylvania, holds community celebrations on John Brown&#x27;s birthday, May 9.
* August 17: In 1906, the Niagara Movement, predecessor of the NAACP, celebrated John Brown Day on August 17.
* October 16: In 2017, the Vermont Legislature designated October 16, the date of the raid, as John Brown Day.

===Meetings in honor of John Brown===
In 1946, the John Brown Memorial Association held its 24th annual pilgrimage to the grave in North Elba, where there were memorial services.

At the 150th anniversary of the raid In 2009, a two-day symposium, &quot;John Brown Comes Home&quot;, was held, on the influence of Brown&#x27;s raid, using facilities in adjacent Lake Placid. Speakers included Bernadine Dohrn and a great-great-great-granddaughter of Brown.

===Museums===

* John Brown Museum, Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, Harpers Ferry, West Virginia
* John Brown Farm State Historic Site, North Elba, New York
* John Brown Farm, Tannery, and Museum, Guys Mills, Pennsylvania
* John Brown House (Chambersburg, Pennsylvania)
* John Brown Museum, Osawatomie, Kansas
* John Brown Raid Headquarters (Kennedy Farm), Samples Manor, Maryland

All of these museums except the one in Harpers Ferry are places Brown lived or stayed.
* Barnum&#x27;s American Museum in New York, destroyed by fire in 1868, contained according to a November 7, 1859, advertisement &quot;a full-length Wax Figure of OSAWATOMIE BROWN, taken from life, and a KNIFE found on the body of his son, at Harper&#x27;s Ferry&quot;. An agent of Barnum traveled to Harpers Ferry in November, saw Brown, and offered him $100 () for &quot;his clothes and pike, and his certificate of their genuineness.&quot; By December 7 the exhibits included &quot;his Commission to a Lieutenancy as well as TWO PIKES or spears taken at Harper&#x27;s Ferry&quot;. On December 16 the Museum added, with document vouching for its authenticity, &quot;the link of the shackles that Cook and Coppock cut in two...that consequently permitted them to escape.&quot; Also exhibited were the Augustus Washington 1847 daguerrotype of Brown (see above) and the now-lost painting by Louis Ransom of the famous, apocryphal incident of Brown kissing a black baby on his way to the gallows, reproduced in an Currier &amp; Ives print (see Paintings). The latter was only exhibited for two months in 1863; Barnum withdrew it to save the building from destruction during the anti-Negro riot that broke out shortly.

=== Statues ===
* Nothing came of the proposal that Kansas send a statue of Brown as one of its two representatives honored in the U.S. Capitol.
* The first statue of Brown, and the only one not at one of his residences, is that located on the (new) John Brown Memorial Plaza, on the former campus of the closed black Western University, site of a freedmen&#x27;s school founded in 1865, the first black school west of the Mississippi River. The statue is the one surviving structure of the entire Quindaro Townsite, a ghost town today part of Kansas City, Kansas (27th Street and Sewell Avenue), a major Underground Railroad station, a key port on the Missouri River for fugitive slaves and contrabands escaping from the slave state of Missouri. The pillar and the life-sized statue of Brown were erected by descendants of slaves in 1911, at a cost of $2,000 (). Lettering reads: &quot;Erected to the Memory of John Brown by a Grateful People&quot;. There is a bronze plaque. In March 2018, the statue was defaced with swastikas and &quot;Hail Satan&quot;.
** At the John Brown Farm State Historic Site, near Lake Placid, New York, there is a 1935 statue of Brown escorting a black child to freedom. The artist was Joseph Pollia. The cost of the statue and pedestal &quot;was contributed in small sums by Negroes of the United States&quot;.
** A statue (1933) is at the John Brown Museum, Brown&#x27;s home in Osawatomie, Kansas. It was sponsored by the Women&#x27;s Relief Corps, Department of Kansas.
** The only other sculptures of Brown are two busts: the first by black sculptor Edmonia Lewis, which she presented to Henry Highland Garnet; and the other, at Tufts University, by Edward Brackett.

=== Streets ===
* Only one major street in the world honors Brown, the Avenue John Brown in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, near an avenue honoring abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner.
** A rural John Brown Road is near Torrington, Connecticut, his birthplace. Small roads near museums in North Elba, New York, and Guys Mills, Pennsylvania, are named for Brown. There is a Harpers Ferry Street in Davie, Florida, and in Ellwood City and Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, in Northwest Pennsylvania near the Ohio border, near the route Owen Brown took seeking refuge after the raid in his brother John Jr.&#x27;s house in Ashtabula County, Ohio, there is a Harpers Ferry Road, and intersecting with it, a smaller John Brown Road. In Osawatomie, Kansas is John Brown Highway.

=== Storer College ===
* Storer College began as the first graded school for blacks in West Virginia. Its location in Harpers Ferry was because of the importance of Brown and his raid. The Arsenal engine house, renamed John Brown&#x27;s Fort, was moved to the Storer campus in 1909. It was used as the college museum.
** A plaque honoring Brown was attached to the Fort in 1918, while it was on the Storer campus.
::In 1931, after years of controversy, a tablet was erected in Harpers Ferry by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy, honoring the key &quot;Lost Cause&quot; belief that their slaves were happy and neither wanted freedom nor supported John Brown. (See Heyward Shepherd monument.) The president of Storer participated in the dedication. In response, W. E. B. DuBois, co-founder of the NAACP, wrote text for a new plaque in 1932. The Storer College administration would not allow it to be put it up, nor did the National Park Service after becoming owner of the Fort. In 2006, it was placed at the site on the former Storer campus where the Fort had been located.

===Other John Brown sites===
* John Brown&#x27;s Fort, Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.
* The John Brown House, where he lived from 1844 to 1854, and John Brown Memorial, the latter of which is located in the Perkins Park area of the Akron Zoo. The memorial was not erected within the zoo; the zoo incorporated the land where it is. It is not well marked and is not normally open to the public. When the monument was erected in 1910, 8,000 people attended and Jason Brown, at the time John Brown&#x27;s oldest living child, spoke.
* The wagon that carried Brown from jail to his execution is preserved by the Jefferson County, West Virginia, Museum in Charles Town.
* A wagon used by Brown when transporting freed slaves from Missouri across Iowa is preserved at the Iowa Historical Society
* An approximate replica of the firehouse was built in 2012 at the Discovery Park of America museum park in Union City, Tennessee. There is a marker explaining the link with John Brown&#x27;s raid.
* Iowa has set up the John Brown Freedom Trail, marking his journey across Iowa leaving Kansas, en route to Chatham, Ontario.
** Lewis, Iowa: &quot;Fighting Slavery – Aiding Runaways. John Brown Freedom Trail – December 20, 1858 – March 12, 1859.&quot;
* Jordan House, West Des Moines, Iowa.
* &quot;Because of the impossibility of colored boys entering work shops where useful trades are taught&quot;, a John Brown Industrial College was planned at Bonner Springs, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City, and purchased.

===Media===
Two notable screen portrayals of Brown were given by actor Raymond Massey. The 1940 film &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot;, starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, depicted Brown completely unsympathetically as a villainous madman and Massey plays him with a constant, wild-eyed stare. The film gave the impression that he did not oppose slavery, even to the point of having a black &quot;mammy&quot; character say, after an especially fierce battle, &quot;Mr. Brown done promised us freedom, but ... if this is freedom, I don&#x27;t want no part of it&quot;. Massey portrayed Brown again in the little-known, low-budget &quot;Seven Angry Men&quot;, in which he was not only the main character, but depicted in a much more restrained, sympathetic way. Massey, along with Tyrone Power and Judith Anderson, starred in the acclaimed 1953 dramatic reading of Stephen Vincent Benét&#x27;s epic Pulitzer Prize-winning poem &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; (1928).

Numerous American poets have written poems about him, including John Greenleaf Whittier, Louisa May Alcott, and Walt Whitman. The Polish poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid wrote two poems praising Brown: &quot;John Brown&quot; and the better known &quot;Do obywatela Johna Brown&quot; (&quot;To Citizen John Brown&quot;). &quot;Marching Song&quot; (1932) is an unpublished play about the legend of John Brown by Orson Welles. Russell Banks&#x27;s 1998 biographical novel about Brown, &quot;Cloudsplitter&quot;, was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. It is narrated by Brown&#x27;s surviving son Owen. James McBride&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;The Good Lord Bird&quot; tells Brown&#x27;s story through the eyes of a young slave, Henry Shackleford, who accompanies Brown to Harpers Ferry. The novel won the 2013 National Book Award for Fiction. A limited episode series based on the book was released starring Ethan Hawke as John Brown.

===Paintings===
A well-known image of Brown in the later 19th century is a Currier and Ives print, based on a lost painting by Louis Ransom. It portrays Brown as a Christ-like figure. The &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; typically depicted with Christ are here a black mother and mulatto child. Legend says that Brown kissed the mythical baby but virtually all scholars agree that this did not in fact happen. Above Brown&#x27;s head, like a halo, is the flag of Virginia and its motto, &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot; (&quot;Thus always to tyrants&quot;). According to Brown&#x27;s supporters, the government of Virginia was tyrannical and according to fugitive slaves, it &quot;is as well the black man&#x27;s, as the white man&#x27;s motto&quot;.
In 1938, Kansas painter John Steuart Curry was commissioned to prepare murals for the Kansas State Capitol in Topeka, Kansas. He chose as his subject the Kansan John Brown, seen by many as the most important man in Kansas history. In the resulting mural, &quot;Tragic Prelude&quot;, Brown holds a Bible in one hand and a Beecher&#x27;s Bible rifle in the other. Behind him are Union and Confederate troops, with dead soldiers; a reference to the Bleeding Kansas period, which Brown was at the center of, and which was commonly seen to have been a dress rehearsal or a tragic prelude to the increasingly inevitable Civil War.
In 1941, Jacob Lawrence illustrated Brown&#x27;s life in &quot;The Legend of John Brown&quot;, a series of 22 gouache paintings. By 1977, these were in such fragile condition that they could not be displayed, and the Detroit Institute of Arts had to commission Lawrence to recreate the series as silkscreen prints. The result was a limited-edition portfolio of 22 hand-screened prints, published with a poem, &quot;John Brown&quot;, by Robert Hayden, commissioned specifically for the project. Though Brown had been a popular topic for many painters, &quot;The Legend of John Brown&quot; was the first series to explore his legacy from an African-American perspective.

Paintings such as Thomas Hovenden&#x27;s &quot;The Last Moments of John Brown&quot; immortalize an apocryphal story in which a black woman offers the condemned Brown her baby to kiss on his way to the gallows. The tale was probably invented by journalist James Redpath.

==Archival material==
===Court material and related documents===
The indictments, summons, sentences, bills of exception, and similar documents for Brown and his raiders are held by the Jefferson County Circuit Clerk, and have been digitized by West Virginia Archives and History. Two separate collections of relevant letters were published. The first is the messages, mostly telegrams, sent and received by Governor Wise. The Senate of Maryland published the many internal telegrams of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

Much material is missing. The order book, which had the minutes of John Brown&#x27;s trial, was evidently possessed by Brown&#x27;s judge Richard Parker in 1888. , its location is unknown. Among the missing material used at his trial as evidence of sedition were bundles of printed copies of his Provisional Constitution, prepared for the &quot;state&quot; Brown intended to set up in the Appalachian Mountains. Even less known is Brown&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of Liberty&quot;, imitating the Declaration of Independence.

According to Prosecutor Andrew Hunter,

There was correspondence from Frederick Douglass and Gerrit Smith, among many others. Hugh Forbes said that the carpet-bag may have contained &quot;an abundant supply of my correspondence&quot;. (After Brown&#x27;s arrest, Smith, Douglass, and future biographer and friend Franklin Sanborn began destroying correspondence and other documents because they feared criminal charges for aiding Brown.)

The carpet-bag also contained maps of Kentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia that showed the locations of State arsenals with proposed routes for attacks and retreats.

Hunter personally took the carpet-bag to Richmond, because he thought it would be safer there. He was at the time a member of the Virginia State Senate. In 1865, when Lee advised that he could no longer defend Richmond, Hunter did not want the &quot;Yankees&quot; to find the carpetbag. He thought that the Capitol was as safe a place as any in Richmond, and he asked Commonwealth Secretary George Wythe Munford if he could hide it in the Capitol. &quot;Munford told me that he has taken the carpet-bag up to the cock-loft of the Capitol and had let down the bag between the wall and the plastering, and I believe those papers are there yet.&quot;

Wise sent attorney Henry Hudnall to Charles Town to put in order Hunter&#x27;s documents. In a letter to Wise of November 17, he refers to &quot;a large quantity of matter&quot;, including &quot;nearly a half bushel of letters&quot; just of Tidd alone.

In 1907–08, there appeared in print a varied collection of letters and other documents a Union soldier from Massachusetts took from Hunter&#x27;s office in the Charles Town courthouse in 1862, when it was being used as a Union barracks.

===Correspondence and other archival material===
The West Virginia Archives and History owns the largest single collection on Brown, the Boyd B. Stutler Collection. A negative microfilm of the material is held by the Ohio Historical Society.

The Hudson Library and Historical Society of Hudson, Ohio, Brown&#x27;s home town, prepared annotated listings of Brown&#x27;s many ancestors, siblings, and children. Since John Brown moved around a lot, had a large family, and had a lot to say, he carried on a voluminous correspondence, including letters to editors, and was repeatedly interviewed by reporters, as he made himself available. Archival material on him and his circle is therefore abundant, and widely scattered. There has never been a complete edition of his extant correspondence; the one scholarly attempt, from 1885, produced a book of 645 pages. Editor F. B. Sanborn stated that he had enough letters for another book. A 2015 book was published just of the letters Brown wrote in the last month of his life, from jail. Additional letters were found and published in the 20th century. Archival material concerning John Brown&#x27;s time in Crawford County, Pennsylvania, including his tannery, is held by the Pelletier Library, Allegheny College, Meadville, Pennsylvania. Clark Atlanta University holds a small collection.

Brown biographer Oswald Garrison Villard surveys the manuscript collections in his 1910 biography. The archive of Villard is in the Columbia University Library. Kansas Memory has a collection of materials regarding Brown&#x27;s activities in Kansas. A project of the Kansas Historical Society, it holds the collection of Brown biographer Richard J. Hinton.

<text>John Brown (8 December 1826 – 27 March 1883) was a Scottish personal attendant and favourite of Queen Victoria for many years after working as a ghillie for Prince Albert. He was appreciated by many (including the Queen) for his competence and companionship, and resented by others (most notably her son and heir apparent, the future Edward VII, the rest of the Queen&#x27;s children, ministers, and the palace staff) for his influence and informal manner. The exact nature of his relationship with Victoria was the subject of great speculation by contemporaries.

== Early life ==
Brown was born on 8 December 1826 at Crathienaird, Crathie and Braemar Aberdeenshire, to Margaret Leys and John Brown, and went to work as an outdoor servant (in Scots &quot;&quot; or &quot;gillie&quot;) at Balmoral Castle, which Queen Victoria and Prince Albert leased in February 1848, and purchased outright in November 1851.

Brown had several younger brothers and a sister, three of whom also entered the royal service. His brother Archibald Anderson &quot;Archie&quot; Brown, 15 years John&#x27;s junior, eventually became personal valet to Victoria&#x27;s youngest son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany.

==Relationship with Queen Victoria==
By 1851, Brown&#x27;s role changed from being gillie and personal friend to Prince Albert to a &quot;permanent role&quot; as the leader of the Queen&#x27;s pony, &quot;on Prince Albert&#x27;s instigation&quot;.
Prince Albert&#x27;s untimely death in 1861 was a shock from which Queen Victoria never fully recovered. John Brown became a friend and supported the Queen. Victoria was known to give him many gifts as well as creating two medals for him, the Faithful Servant Medal and the Devoted Service Medal. She also commissioned a portrait of him in 1876, given to him on Albert&#x27;s birthday, 26 August.

Victoria&#x27;s children and ministers were not as accepting of the high regard she had for Brown, and rumours circulated that there was something improper in their relationship. Victoria herself dismissed the chatter as &quot;ill-natured gossip in the higher classes&quot;.

The diaries of Lewis Harcourt contain a report that one of the Queen&#x27;s chaplains, Rev. Norman Macleod, made a deathbed confession repenting his action in presiding over Queen Victoria&#x27;s marriage to John Brown. Debate continues over this report. Harcourt did not receive the confession directly (he was nine when Macleod died) but rather, it is claimed to have passed from Macleod&#x27;s sister to the wife of Henry Ponsonby, the Queen&#x27;s private secretary, and thence to Harcourt&#x27;s father Sir William Harcourt, then Home Secretary. Harcourt served as Home Secretary in the final three years of Brown&#x27;s life.

A letter from Victoria to Viscount Cranbrook, written shortly after Brown&#x27;s death but rediscovered in 2004, shows how she described the loss:

The phrase &quot;for the second time&quot; relates to the death of Brown after the death of her husband Prince Albert. The historian who discovered the letter believed that it suggested that Victoria, in her mind, equated Brown&#x27;s death with Albert&#x27;s, and that she therefore viewed him as more than a servant, but also as a good friend and confidant. There is, however, no evidence that Brown and Victoria were lovers.

Those who believe that the Queen saw Brown as little more than a servant point to the fact that after his death she became similarly attached to an Indian servant, Mohammed Abdul Karim, one of two who had come to work for her in late June 1887. He came to be resented even more than John Brown. Unlike Brown, whose loyalty was not questioned, there were contemporary allegations that Abdul Karim exploited his position for personal gain and prestige.

Brown pre-deceased the Queen, in 1883, at the age of 56. Tony Rennell&#x27;s book &quot;Last Days of Glory: The Death of Queen Victoria&quot; describes Victoria&#x27;s detailed instructions about her burial to her doctor, Sir James Reid. These included a list of the keepsakes and mementoes, photographs and trinkets to be placed in the coffin with her: along with Albert&#x27;s dressing gown and a plaster cast of his hand, the Queen was buried with a lock of Brown&#x27;s hair, his photograph, Brown&#x27;s mother&#x27;s wedding ring, given to her by Brown, along with several of his letters. The photograph, wrapped in white tissue paper, was placed in her left hand, with flowers arranged to hide it from view. She wore the ring on the third finger of her right hand.

== Death ==
Two days after being afflicted with erysipelas, which crippled him to the point of not being able to attend the queen for the first time in over eighteen years as her servant, John Brown died, aged 56, at Windsor Castle on 27 March 1883, and is buried in Crathie Kirkyard, in the next plot to his parents and a number of his siblings. The inscription on his gravestone further shows the attachment between him and the Queen:


&quot;He was the best, truest heart that ever beat,&quot; Queen Victoria wrote to Brown&#x27;s sister-in-law, Jessie McHardy Brown. In a letter to the British poet Alfred Tennyson, from whom she commissioned lines for Brown&#x27;s tombstone, Victoria eulogised her faithful servant:

Queen Victoria commissioned a life-sized statue of Brown by Edgar Boehm shortly after his death. The inscription read: &quot;Friend more than Servant. Loyal. Truthful. Brave. Self less than Duty, even to the Grave.&quot; When Victoria&#x27;s son succeeded to the throne he had the statue moved to a less conspicuous site.

The statues and private memorials that Victoria had created for Brown were destroyed on the orders of her son, Edward VII, with whom Brown had often clashed and who resented Brown.

== Honours ==
* Victoria Devoted Service Medal (gold medal, which bears on the reverse, &quot;To John Brown, Esq., in recognition of his presence of mind and devotion at Buckingham Palace, February 29, 1872.&quot;)
* Faithful Servant Medal (silver medal, with bar denoting ten additional years of service)
Design and manufacture of both medals were commissioned by Queen Victoria. 
* Silver medal (possibly Servant medal), showing the head of Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse

==In popular culture==
Gordon McLeod portrayed John Brown in &quot;Victoria the Great&quot; (1937), &quot;Sixty Glorious Years&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Prime Minister&quot; (1941).

Gerhard Bienert portrayed John Brown in &quot;Ohm Kruger&quot; (1941).

The 1950 film &quot;The Mudlark&quot; features John Brown at Windsor Castle, portrayed by Finlay Currie.

William Dysart portrayed John Brown in the TV series &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot; (1975).

The 1997 film &quot;Mrs Brown&quot; is the fictionalised story of John Brown. Sir Billy Connolly portrays Brown and Dame Judi Dench portrays Queen Victoria.

<doc id="77328" wikidata="Q168549" url="?curid=77328" title="Chauci">
<text>The Chauci were an ancient Germanic tribe living in the low-lying region between the Rivers Ems and Elbe, on both sides of the Weser and ranging as far inland as the upper Weser. Along the coast they lived on artificial mounds called &quot;terpen&quot;, built high enough to remain dry during the highest tide. A dense population of Chauci lived further inland, and they are presumed to have lived in a manner similar to the lives of the other Germanic peoples of the region.

Their ultimate origins are not well understood. In the Germanic pre-Migration Period (i.e., before ) the Chauci and the related Frisians, Saxons, and Angles inhabited the Continental European coast from the Zuyder Zee to south Jutland. All of these peoples shared a common material culture, and so cannot be defined archaeologically. The Chauci originally centered on the Weser and Elbe, but in they expanded to the River Ems by expelling the neighboring Ampsivarii, whereby they gained a border with the Frisians to the west. The Romans referred to the Chauci living between the Weser and Elbe as the &#x27;Greater Chauci&#x27; and those living between the Ems and Weser as the &#x27;Lesser Chauci&#x27;.

The Chauci entered the historical record in descriptions of them by classical Roman sources late in the first century BC in the context of Roman military campaigns and sea raiding. For the next 200 years the Chauci provided Roman auxiliaries through treaty obligations, but they also appear in their own right in concert with other Germanic tribes, opposing the Romans. Accounts of wars therefore mention the Chauci on both sides of the conflict, though the actions of troops under treaty obligation were separate from the policies of the tribe.

The Chauci lost their separate identity in the third century when they merged with the Saxons, after which time they were considered to be Saxons. The circumstances of the merger are an unsettled issue of scholarly research.

==Society and life==

The Germans of the region were not strongly hierarchical. This had been noted by Tacitus, for example when he mentioned the names of two kings of the first century Frisians and added that they were kings &quot;as far as the Germans are under kings&quot;. Haywood (&quot;Dark Age Naval Power&quot;, 1999) says the Chauci were originally neither highly centralised nor highly stratified, though they became more so after 100 AD. Barbara Yorke, speaking of the fifth century, describes the &#x27;Continental Saxons&#x27; (which then included the Chauci) as having powerful local families and a dominant military leader.

Writing in AD 79, Pliny the Elder said that the Germanic tribes were members of separate groups of people, suggesting a distinction among them. He said that the Chauci, Cimbri and Teutoni—the people from the River Ems through Jutland and for some distance inland—were members of a group called Ingaevones (a &quot;Cimbri&quot; people were also given as members of a different group, and this is likely a different people).

Tacitus, writing in AD 98, described the inland, non-coastal Chauci homeland as immense, densely populated, and well-stocked with horses. He was effusive in his praise of their character as a people, saying that they were the noblest of the Germans, preferring justice to violence, being neither aggressive nor predatory, but militarily capable and always prepared for war if the need arose.

Pliny (AD 23–79) had visited the coastal region and described the Chauci who lived there. He said that they were &quot;wretched natives&quot; living on a barren coast in small cottages (or huts) on hilltops, or on mounds of turf built high enough to stay dry during the highest tide (i.e., &quot;terpen&quot;). They fished for food, and unlike their neighbors (i.e., those living inland, away from the coast) they had no cattle, and had nothing to drink except rainwater caught in ditches. They used a type of dried mud (i.e., &quot;surface peat&quot;) as fuel for cooking and heating. He also mentioned their spirit of independence, saying that even though they had nothing of value, they would deeply resent any attempt to conquer them.
==Classical Roman history==
The record is incomplete. The bulk of historical information about the Chauci is from the &quot;Annals&quot; of Tacitus, written in 117. Many parts of his works have not survived, including an entire section covering the years AD 38–46, as well as the years after AD 69.

The earliest mention of the Chauci is from 12 BC and suggests that they were assisting other Germanic tribes in a war against the Romans. Drusus campaigned against those Germans along the lower Rhine, and after devastating the lands west and north of the Rhine he won over (or defeated or intimidated) the Frisians. He was in the process of attacking the Chauci when his vessels were trapped by an ebb tide. Drusus gave up the attack and withdrew.

===Aftermath of Teutoburg Forest, c. 15===
The Germans under Arminius had destroyed 3 Roman legions under Varus at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9. The Romans recoiled at first but then Germanicus initiated destructive campaigns against those Germans whom the Romans blamed for their defeat. The Chauci were not among them, and were said to have promised aid, and were associated with the Romans in &quot;military fellowship&quot;. However, in defeating Arminius&#x27; own tribe (the Cherusci) the Romans were unable to capture or kill Arminius, who escaped. There were Chauci among the Roman auxiliaries, and they were rumored to have allowed the escape. In one of the campaigns a Roman fleet (probably riverine, not ocean-going) was broken up by a storm, causing many casualties. Germanicus himself managed to survive by reaching the lands of the Chauci, who provided him with a safe haven. Germanicus&#x27; campaigns had resulted in recovery of two of three Aquila lost in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest defeat; the third legionary standard was recovered in AD 41 by Publius Gabinius from the Chauci during the reign of Claudius, brother of Germanicus.

A parenthetical note concerns the Ampsivarii. They had not supported the German cause led by Arminius in 9 AD and had been ostracized as a result. The Chauci had suffered no such disaffection from the other Germanic tribes in the aftermath of Teutoburg Forest, nor had they alienated the Romans. Many years later, , the Chauci seized upon an opportunity to expel the Ampsivarii and occupy their lands at the mouth of the River Ems, whereby they gained a border with the Frisians to the west.

===Roman war against Gannascus, c. 47===

In AD 47 (and perhaps for some time earlier), the Chauci along with the Frisians were led by a certain Gannascus of the Canninefates. They raided along the then-wealthy coast of Gallia Belgica (i.e., the land south of the Rhine and north of the Rivers Marne and Seine), and the Chauci made inroads into the region that would later become the neighbouring Roman province of Germania Inferior, in the area of the Rhine delta in what is now the southern Netherlands.

Corbulo was made the local Roman military commander. He successfully engaged the Germans on both land and water, occupied the Rhine with his triremes and sent his smaller vessels up the estuaries and canals. The Germanic flotilla was destroyed in a naval engagement, Gannascus was driven out, and Frisian territory was forcibly occupied.

A negotiation between the Romans and Gannascus was arranged under the auspices of the &#x27;Greater Chauci&#x27;, which the Romans used as an opportunity to assassinate their opponent. The Chauci were outraged by the act of bad faith, so the emperor Claudius forbade further attacks on the Germans in an effort to ease tensions, and the Romans withdrew to the Rhine.
===Batavian Revolt, c. 69===
In AD 69 the Batavi and other tribes rose against Roman rule in the Revolt of the Batavi, becoming a general uprising by all the Germans in the region. Led by Civilis, they inflicted huge casualties on the Romans, including the destruction of a Roman fleet by a Germanic one off the North Sea coast. Led by Cerialis, the Romans gave as good as they had gotten, ultimately forcing a humiliating peace on the Batavi and stationing a legion on their territory.

Both the Chauci and the Frisians had auxiliaries serving under the Romans, and in a siege and assault by Civilis at &quot;Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis&quot; (at modern Cologne), a cohort of Chauci and Frisians had been trapped and burned. The Chauci had supported Civilis in their own name, providing him with reinforcements.

==Sea raiding==
The Chauci were one of the most prominent early Germanic sea raiders. They are probable participants in the Germanic flotilla that was destroyed by Drusus in 12 BC. They were raiding the coasts of Roman Belgica in AD 41, long before they participated in further raids of the same coasts under Gannascus in AD 47. It is likely that their raiding was endemic over the years, as the few surviving accounts probably do not reflect all occurrences. Tacitus describes the Chauci as &#x27;peaceful&#x27; in his &quot;Germania&quot; (AD 98), but this is in a passage describing the non-coastal, inland Chauci, whereas sea raiders are necessarily a coastal people.

By the late second century Chauci raiding was ongoing and more serious than before, continuing in the English Channel until their last recorded raids –175. While there are no historical sources to inform us one way or the other, it is likely that the Chauci continued their raiding and then played a role in the formation of the new Germanic powers, the Franks and Saxons who were raiders in the third century.

There is archaeological evidence of destruction by raiders between 170–200, ranging along the Continental coast down to the Bay of Biscay, to northwest Belgica (e.g., fire destruction at Amiens, Thérouanne, Vendeuil-Caply, Beauvais, Bavai, Tournai, and Arras), to coastal Britain (e.g., fire destruction at the Essex sites of Chelmsford, Billericay, Gestingthorpe, Braintree, Wickford, Kelvedon, Great Chesterford, and Harlow). The perpetrators are unknown, but Chauci raiders are among the prime suspects.

The Romans responded with defensive measures. Caistor-by-Norwich, Chelmsford and Forum Hadriani (present day Voorburg) (the &quot;civitas&quot; of the Canninefates near The Hague) were all fortified , and the Romans began a defensive system of protection especially along the coasts of Britain and the Continent. This system would be continually maintained and improved upon, which the Romans would not have done unless there was a continuing threat to be addressed. The system would continue to evolve through the disappearance of Chauci raiders and their replacement by the Frankish and Saxon ones, up to the end of the fourth century. By then it would be known as the Saxon Shore, a name given it by the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;.

A passage written by Zosimus has been interpreted as one of the last mentions of the Chauci, and one where they are specifically mentioned as a Saxon group; but it depends upon whether we can equate them with the &quot;Kouadoi&quot; in Zosimus&#x27;s Greek, a name he had apparently used wrongly. Julian fought against Saxons and Franks, including the Salians, but then allowed the Salians &quot;descended from the Franks&quot; to settle in Toxandria in 358. According to Zosimus, this happened in response to an attack from the sea by the &quot;Kouadoi&quot; Saxons which affected both Romans and Salians, who had been living in the river delta.

==In literature==
&quot;Beowulf&quot; is an Old English heroic poem where the hero (Beowulf) engages in battles with antagonists. Set in long-ago Scandinavia, it makes frequent references to the peoples who are a part of the story, and efforts have been made to connect those peoples with peoples mentioned in ancient historical records. The &quot;Hugas&quot; of the poem are said to be a reference to the Chauci.

<text>The Cherusci were a Germanic tribe that inhabited parts of the plains and forests of northwestern Germania in the area of the Weser River and present-day Hanover during the first centuries BC and AD. Roman sources reported they considered themselves kin with other Irmino tribes and claimed common descent from an ancestor called Mannus. During the early Roman Empire under Augustus, the Cherusci first served as allies of Rome and sent sons of their chieftains to receive Roman education and serve in the Roman army as auxiliaries. The Cherusci leader Arminius led a confederation of tribes in the ambush that destroyed three Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest in AD9. He was subsequently kept from further damaging Rome by disputes with the Marcomanni and reprisal attacks led by Germanicus. After rebel Cherusci killed Arminius in AD21, infighting among the royal family led to the highly Romanized line of his brother Flavus coming to power. Following their defeat by the Chatti around AD88, the Cherusci do not appear in further accounts of the German tribes, apparently being absorbed into the late classical groups such as the Saxons, Thuringians, Franks, Bavarians, and Allemanni.
==Name==
Cherusci () is the Latin name for the tribe. Both it and the Greek form &quot;Khēroûskoi&quot; () are presumably transcriptions of an otherwise unattested Old Germanic demonym, whose etymology is unclear. The dominant opinion in scholarship is that it may derive from (&quot;hart&quot;), which may have had totemistic significance for the group. Another hypothesisproposed in the 19th century by Jacob Grimm and othersderives the name from (; , a kind of sword). Hans Kuhn has argued that the derivational suffix involved in both explanations is uncommon in Germanic. He suggested that the name may therefore be a compound of ultimately non-Germanic origin and connected to the hypothesized .

==History==

The Cherusci were a Germanic tribe living around the central Weser River in the 1st century BC and 1st century AD. They are first attested in Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot;. Caesar relates that in the year 53BC he crossed the Rhine to punish the Suebi for sending reinforcements to the Treveri. In passing, he mentions that the Suebi were separated from the Cherusci by the &quot;Bacenis Forest&quot;, a relatively impenetrable beech forest, possibly the Harz. Pliny grouped them with the nearby Suebi, Chatti, and Hermunduri as Irminones, tribes who claimed descent from an ancestor named Mannus. Tacitus later placed them between the Chatti and the Chauci, generally taken to indicate a territory between the Weser and Elbe.

As part of his German campaigns, Drusus marched an army east into the territory of the Cherusci in 11BC and was ambushed as he returned west at a narrow pass called Arbalo, probably near modern Hameln or Hildesheim. The Cherusci were initially victorious but paused their attack, allowing the surviving Romans to break through the encirclement and escape. By that winter, Drusus had recovered enough control that a garrison was stationed somewhere in Cheruscan territory, probably at either Haltern or Bergkamen in North Rhine-Westphalia. The Cherusci continued to resist the campaigns of Tiberius, L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, and M. Vinicius as late as the &quot;vast war&quot; begun around 2BC.

Finally, in AD4, Tiberius overcame the factions of the Cherusci still hostile to Rome and by the next year he considered the tribe a Roman ally, giving it special privileges. The chieftain Segimer sent at least two sons who became Roman citizens and served in the Roman military as cavalry auxiliaries. The elder son Arminius returned as an auxiliary commander under P. Quictilius Varus, who began organizing Germany as the new province of Germania Magna in AD7. This involved expanded taxation and demands of tribute, and Arminius began organizing a combined attack on Varus&#x27;s legions. A Cheruscan noble named Segestes attempted to warn the governor repeatedly, but Varus ignored him and followed Arminius into an ambush in the Teutoburg Forest and marshes in AD9. Working together, the Cherusci, Bructeri, Marsi, Sicambri, Chauci, and Chatti completely destroyed the 17th, 18th, and 19th Legions; Varus and many of the officers fell on their swords during the battle. Cassius Dio reports that Segimer was second in command during the battle but Arminius seems to have acted as chieftain himself soon thereafter. He abducted Segestes&#x27;s daughter Thusnelda and married her.

The Romans encouraged the Marcomanni to attack the Cherusci and launched punitive raids of their own, eventually recovering some of the lost eagle standards from the defeated legions. In AD14, Germanicus raided the Chatti and Marsi with 12,000 legionnaires, 26 cohorts of auxiliaries, and eight cavalry squadrons and systematically laid waste to an area 50 miles wide such that &quot;no sex, no age found pity&quot;. He then campaigned against the Cherusci, freeing Segestes from captivity and seizing the pregnant Thusnelda. Arminius assembled the Cherusci and surrounding tribes while Germanicus marched some men east from the Rhine and sailed others from the North Sea up the Ems, attacking the Bructeri on their way. These two forces met and then ravaged the land between the Ems and the Lippe. When they reached the Teutoburg Forest, they found the bodies of the slain Romans unburied and in places sacrificed on German altars. The army buried the dead for half a day, after which Germanicus stopped the work to return to war against the Germans. Making his way to the Cherusci heartland, Germanicus was attacked by Arminius&#x27;s men at Pontes Longi (&quot;the long causeways&quot;) in the boggy lowlands near the Ems. The Cherusci trapped and began to kill the Roman cavalry but the Roman infantry was able to check and rout them over the course of a two day battle. Tacitus considered this a victory although historians such as Wells think it was more likely inconclusive.

In AD16, Germanicus returned with eight legions and Gallic and Germanic auxiliary units, including men led by Arminius&#x27;s younger brother Flavus. Marching from the Rhine and along the Ems and Weser, the Romans met Arminius&#x27;s forces at the plains of Idistaviso by the Weser near modern Rinteln. Tacitus reports the Battle of the Weser River as a decisive Roman victory: Arminius and his uncle Inguiomer were both wounded but evaded capture. The Roman soldiers proclaimed Tiberius as and raised a pile of arms as a trophy with the names of the defeated tribes inscribed beneath them. This trophy enraged the Germans, who ceased retreating beyond the Elbe and regrouped to attack the Romans at the Angrivarian Wall. This battle also ended in a decisive Roman victory, with Germanicus supposedly directing his men to exterminate the Germanic tribes. A mound was raised with an inscription reading &quot;The army of Tiberius Caesar, after thoroughly conquering the tribes between the Rhine and the Elbe, has dedicated this monument to Mars, Jupiter, and Augustus.&quot;

In the next year, Germanicus was recalled to Rome. Tacitus reports this as partially caused by the emperor&#x27;s growing jealousy of the general&#x27;s fame, but permitted him to celebrate a triumphal march on 26 May: Germanicus was then moved to the Parthian border in Syria and soon died, possibly from poisoning. Arminius was killed in turn by Segestes and his allies in AD21.

After Arminius&#x27;s murder, the Romans left the Cherusci more or less to their own devices. In AD47, the Cherusci asked Rome to send Italicus, the son of Flavus and nephew of Arminius, to become their chieftain, as civil war had destroyed their other nobility. He was initially well liked but, since he was raised in Rome as a Roman citizen, he soon fell out of favor. He was succeeded by Chariomerus, presumably his son, who was defeated by the Chatti and deposed around AD88.

Tacitus (56) writes of the Cherusci:Dwelling on one side of the Chauci and Chatti, the Cherusci long cherished, unassailed, an excessive and enervating love of peace. This was more pleasant than safe, for to be peaceful is self-deception among lawless and powerful neighbours. Where the strong hand decides, moderation and justice are terms applied only to the more powerful; and so the Cherusci, ever reputed good and just, are now called cowards and fools, while in the case of the victorious Chatti success has been identified with prudence. The downfall of the Cherusci brought with it also that of the Fosi, a neighbouring tribe, which shared equally in their disasters, though they had been inferior to them in prosperous days.

Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; places the Cherusci, Calucones, and Chamavi (, &quot;Kamauoì&quot;) all near one other and &quot;Mount Melibocus&quot; (probably the Harz Mountains).

The later history of the Cherusci is unattested.

<doc id="77332" wikidata="Q483159" url="?curid=77332" title="Syr Darya">
<text>The Syr Darya , historically known as the Jaxartes ( , ), is a river in Central Asia. The name, which is Persian, literally means &quot;Syr Sea&quot; or &quot;Syr River&quot;. It originates in the Tian Shan Mountains in Kyrgyzstan and eastern Uzbekistan and flows for west and north-west through Uzbekistan, Sughd province of Tajikistan, and southern Kazakhstan to the northern remnants of the Aral Sea. It is the northern and eastern of the two main rivers in the endorheic basin of the Aral Sea, the other being the Amu Darya (Jayhun, also known by its classical name the Oxus).

In the Soviet era, extensive irrigation projects were constructed around both rivers, diverting their water into farmland and causing, during the post-Soviet era, the virtual disappearance of the Aral Sea, once the world&#x27;s fourth-largest lake. The point at which the river flows from Tajikistan into Uzbekistan is, at above sea level, the lowest elevation in Tajikistan.

==Name==
The second part of the name (, ) means &quot;lake&quot; or &quot;sea&quot; in Persian and &quot;river&quot; in the Central Asian Persian. The current name dates only from the 18th century.

The earliest recorded name was &quot;Jaxartes&quot; or &quot;Iaxartes&quot; () in Ancient Greek, consist of two morpheme &quot;Iaxa&quot; and &quot;artes&quot;, found in several sources, including those relating to Alexander the Great. The Greek name hearkens back to the Old Persian name &quot;Yakhsha Arta&quot; (&quot;True Pearl&quot;), perhaps a reference to the color of its glacially-fed water. More evidence for the Persian etymology comes from the river&#x27;s Turkic name up to the time of the Arab conquest, the &quot;Yinçü&quot;, or &quot;Pearl river&quot;, from Middle Chinese *&quot;t͡ɕiɪn-t͡ɕɨo&quot;. Tang Chinese also recorded this name as Yaosha River (MC: *&quot;jɨɐk-ʃˠɛt&quot;) and later Ye River (MC: *&quot;jiɛp&quot;).

The current local name of the river, &quot;Syr&quot; (&quot;Sïr&quot;), does not appear before the 16th century. In the 17th century, Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur Khan, historian and ruler of Khiva, called the Aral Sea the &quot;Sea of Sïr,&quot; or &quot;Sïr Tengizi&quot;.

The important evidence is the etymology of the name of the Syr-Darya River mentioned by the ancient authors – Yaksart, established by V. A. Livshits (2003: 10). It means &#x27;flowing&#x27; or &#x27;streaming&#x27;. The word belongs to the Sogdian dialect that had emerged from the Saka language group.

==History==

When the Macedonian army of Alexander the Great reached the Jaxartes in 329 BC, after travelling through Bactria and Sogdia without encountering any opposition, they met with the first instances of native resistance to their presence. In October 329 BC the Macedonians fought the Battle of Jaxartes against the Saka, killing some 1,200 combatants including the leader of the nomads. Alexander was forced to retire south to deal with a revolt in Sogdia. Alexander was wounded in the fighting that ensued and the native tribes took to attacking the Macedonian garrisons stationed in their towns. As the revolt against Alexander intensified it spread through Sogdia, plunging it into two years of warfare, the intensity of which surpassed any other conflict of the &quot;Anabasis Alexandri&quot;. 

On the shores of the Syr Darya, Alexander placed a garrison in the City of Cyrus (Cyropolis in Greek), which he then renamed after himself Alexandria Eschate—&quot;Alexandria the furthest&quot;—in 329 BC. For most of its history since at least the Muslim conquest of Central Asia in the 7th to 8th centuries AD, the name of this city (in present-day Tajikistan) has been Khujand.

In the mid-19th century, during the Russian conquest of Turkestan, the Russian Empire introduced steam navigation to the Syr Darya, initially from Fort Raim but with an important river port at Kazalinsk (Kazaly) from 1847 to 1882, when service ceased.

During the Soviet era, a resource-sharing system was instituted in which Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan shared water originating from the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers with Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in summer. In return, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received Kazakh, Turkmen, and Uzbek coal, gas, and electricity in winter. After the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, this system disintegrated and the Central Asian nations have failed to reinstate it. Inadequate infrastructure, poor water-management, and outdated irrigation methods all exacerbate the issue.

In 2012, the Syrdarya–Turkestan State Regional Natural Park was opened in Kazakhstan, in hopes of protecting the river plain ecosystems, archaeological sites, and historical-cultural monuments, as well as plants and animal species, some of which are rare or endangered.

==Geography==
The river rises in two headstreams in the Tian Shan Mountains in Kyrgyzstan and eastern Uzbekistan—the Naryn River and the Kara Darya which come together in the Uzbek part of the Fergana Valley—and flows for some west and north-west through Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan to the remains of the Aral Sea. The Syr Darya drains an area of over , but no more than actually contribute significant flow to the river: indeed, two of the largest rivers in its basin, the Talas and the Chu, dry up before reaching it. Its annual flow is a very modest per year—half that of its sister river, the Amu Darya.

Along its course, the Syr Darya irrigates the most productive agricultural regions in all of Central Asia, together with the towns of Kokand, Khujand, Kyzylorda and Turkestan.

Various local governments throughout history have built and maintained an extensive system of canals. These canals are of central importance in this arid region. Many fell into disuse in the 17th and early 18th century, but the Khanate of Kokand rebuilt many in the 19th century, primarily along the Upper and Middle Syr Darya.

==Ecological damage==
Massive expansion of irrigation canals in Middle and Lower Syr Darya during the Soviet period to water cotton and rice fields caused ecological damage to the area. The amount of water taken from the river was such that in some periods of the year, no water at all reached the Aral Sea. The Amu Darya in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan faced a similar situation.

The uranium concentration of the stream water is increased in Tajikistan with values of 43 μg/L and 12 μg/L; the WHO guideline value for drinking water of 30 μg/L is partly exceeded. The main input of uranium occurs upstream in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.

<text>The Argonauts ( ; ) were a band of heroes in Greek mythology, who in the years before the Trojan War (around 1300 BC) accompanied Jason to Colchis in his quest to find the Golden Fleece. Their name comes from their ship, &quot;Argo&quot;, named after its builder, Argus. They were sometimes called Minyans, after a prehistoric tribe in the area.

== Mythology ==
===The Golden Fleece===
After the death of King Cretheus, the Aeolian Pelias usurped the throne from his half-brother Aeson and became king of Iolcus in Thessaly (near the modern city of Volos). Because of this unlawful act, an oracle warned him that a descendant of Aeolus would seek revenge. Pelias put to death every prominent descendant of Aeolus he could, but spared Aeson because of the pleas of their mother Tyro. Instead, Pelias kept Aeson prisoner and forced him to renounce his inheritance. Aeson married Alcimede, who bore him a son named Jason. Pelias intended to kill the baby at once, but Alcimede summoned her kinswomen to weep over him as if he were stillborn. She faked a burial and smuggled the baby to Mount Pelion. He was raised by the centaur Chiron, the trainer of heroes.

When Jason was 20 years old, an oracle ordered him to dress as a Magnesian and head to the Iolcan court. While traveling Jason lost his sandal crossing the muddy Anauros river while helping an old woman (Hera in disguise). The goddess was angry with King Pelias for killing his stepgrandmother Sidero after she had sought refuge in Hera&#x27;s temple.

Another oracle warned Pelias to be on his guard against a man with one shoe. Pelias was presiding over a sacrifice to Poseidon with several neighboring kings in attendance. Among the crowd stood a tall youth in leopard skin with only one sandal. Pelias recognized that Jason was his nephew. He could not kill him because prominent kings of the Aeolian family were present. Instead, he asked Jason: &quot;What would you do if an oracle announced that one of your fellow-citizens were destined to kill you?&quot; Jason replied that he would send him to go and fetch the Golden Fleece, not knowing that Hera had put those words in his mouth.

Jason learned later that Pelias was being haunted by the ghost of Phrixus. Phrixus had fled from Orchomenus riding on a divine ram to avoid being sacrificed and took refuge in Colchis where he was later denied proper burial. According to an oracle, Iolcus would never prosper unless his ghost was taken back in a ship, together with the golden ram&#x27;s fleece. This fleece now hung from a tree in the grove of the Colchian Ares, guarded night and day by a dragon that never slept. Pelias swore before Zeus that he would give up the throne at Jason&#x27;s return while expecting that Jason&#x27;s attempt to steal the Golden Fleece would be a fatal enterprise. However, Hera acted in Jason&#x27;s favour during the perilous journey.
===The crew of &quot;Argo&quot;===
There is no definite list of the Argonauts. H. J. Rose explains this was because &quot;an Argonautic ancestor was an addition to even the proudest of pedigrees.&quot; The following list is collated from several lists given in ancient sources.
In Pindar&#x27;s Pythian Odes, the following heroes are either named or implied as part of the Argonauts: Jason, Heracles, Castor, Polydeuces, Euphemus, Periclymenus, Echion, Erytus, Orpheus, Zetes, Calais and Mopsus.

Several more names are discoverable from other sources:
*Amyrus (son of Poseidon), eponym of a Thessalian city, is given by Stephanus of Byzantium as &quot;one of the Argonauts&quot;; he is otherwise said to have been a son of Poseidon and to have given his name to the river Amyrus.
*Philammon, son of Apollo was also reported one of the Argonauts.

==The journey==

Jason, along with his other 49 crew-mates, sailed off from Iolcus to Colchis to fetch the golden fleece.

=== Women of Lemnos ===
The Argonauts first stopped at Lemnos where they learned that all the males had been murdered. The reason of which was as follows: for several years, the women did not honor and make offerings to Aphrodite and because of her anger, she visited them with a noisome smell. Therefore, their spouses took captive women from the neighboring country of Thrace and bedded with them. Dishonored, all the Lemnian women, except Hypsipyle, were instigated by the same goddess in conspiring to kill their fathers and husbands. They then deposed King Thoas, who should have died along with the whole tribe of men, but was secretly spared by his daughter Hypsipyle. She put Thoas on board a ship which a storm carried to the island of Taurica.

In the meantime, the Argonauts sailing along, the guardian of the harbour Iphinoe saw them and announced their coming to Hypsipyle, the new queen. Polyxo who by virtue of her middle age, gave advice that she should put them under obligation to the gods of hospitality and invite them to a friendly reception. Hypsipyle fell in love with their captain Jason. They had sons, Euneus and Nebrophonus or Deipylus. The other Argonauts consorted with the Lemnian women, and their descendants were called Minyans, since some among them had previously emigrated from Minyan Orchomenus to Iolcus. (Later, these Minyans were driven out from the island and came to Lacedaemon). The Lemnian women gave the names of the Argonauts to the children they had conceived by them. Delayed many days there, they were chided by Hercules and departed.

But later, when the other women learned that Hypsipyle had spared her father, they tried to kill her. She fled from them, but pirates captured and took her to Thebes where they sold her as a slave to King Lycus. (Hypsipyle reappeared years later, when the Argives marching against Thebes learned from her the way to a spring in Nemea, where she served as nurse to King Lycurgus&#x27; son Opheltes.) Her son Euneus later became king of Lemnos. In order to purify the island from blood guilt, he ordered that all Lemnian hearth-fires be put off for nine days and a new fire be brought on a ship from Apollo&#x27;s altar in Delos.

=== Island of Cyzicus ===
After Lemnos, the Argonauts made their second stop at Bear Mountain, an island of the Propontis shaped like a bear. The locals, called the Doliones, were all descended from Poseidon. Their king Cyzicus, son of Eusorus, who had just gotten married, received the Argonauts with generous hospitality and decided to have a huge party with them. During that event, the king tried to tell Jason not to go to the eastern side of the island, but he got distracted by Heracles, and forgot to tell Jason.

When they had left the king and sailed a whole day, a storm that arose in the night brought them unaware to the same island. Cyzicus, thinking they were a Pelasgican army (for they were constantly harassed by these enemies) attacked them on the shore at night in mutual ignorance of each other. The Argonauts slew many, including Cyzicus, who was killed by Jason himself. On the next day, when they came near the shore and knew what they had done, the Argonauts mourned and cut off their hair. Jason gave Cyzicus a costly burial and handed over the kingdom to his sons.

=== Lost comrades ===

After the burial, the Argonauts sailed away and touched at Mysia, where they left behind Heracles and Polyphemus. Hylas, son of Thiodamas, had been sent to draw water and was ravished away by nymphs on account of his beauty. However, Polyphemus heard him cry out and gave chase, believing that he was being carried off by robbers. After informing Heracles, the ship put to sea while the two searched for Hylas. Polyphemus ended up founding the city Cius in Mysia, reigning as king while Heracles returned to Argos, though accounts differ regarding Heracles&#x27; story. Herodorus&#x27; version says that Heracles did not sail at all at that time, but was instead serving as a slave at the court of Omphale. Pherecydes&#x27; version says that he was left behind at Aphetae in Thessaly, the Argo having declared with human voice that she could not bear his weight. Nevertheless, Demaratus recorded that Heracles sailed to Colchis; for Dionysius even affirmed that he was the leader of the Argonauts.

=== Land of the Bebryces ===
From Mysia, they departed to the land of the Bebryces which was ruled by King Amycus, son of Poseidon and Melie, a Bithynian nymph. Being a doughty man, he compelled the strangers who came to his kingdom to contend with him in boxing and slew the vanquished. When he challenged the best man of the crew to a boxing match, Pollux fought against him and slew him with a blow on the elbow. When the Bebryces made a rush at him, the chiefs snatched up their arms and put them to flight with great slaughter.
=== Phineus and the Harpies ===

Thence, they put to sea and came to land at Salmydessus in Thrace, where Phineus dwelt. The latter was said to be the son of Agenor or of Poseidon, and a seer who was bestowed by Apollo with the gift of prophecy. Phineus had lost the sight of both eyes because of the following reasons, (1) blinded by Zeus because he revealed the deliberations of the gods and foretold the future to men, (2) by Boreas and the Argonauts because he blinded his own two sons by Cleopatra at the instigation of their stepmother; or (3) by Poseidon, because he revealed to the children of Phrixus how they could sail from Colchis to Greece. Zeus then set over him the Harpies, who are called the hounds of Zeus. These were winged female creatures, and when a table was laid for Phineus, they flew down from the sky and snatched up most of the victuals from his lips, and what little they left stank so that nobody could touch it.
When the Argonauts would have consulted him about the voyage, he said that he would advise them about it if they would free him from the punishment. So the Argonauts laid a table of viands beside him, and the Harpies with a shriek suddenly pounced down and snatched away the food. When Zetes and Calais, the sons of Boreas, saw that, they drew their swords and, having wings on head and feet, pursued them through the air. Now it was fated that the Harpies should perish by the sons of Boreas, and that the sons of Boreas should die when they could not catch up a fugitive. So the Harpies were pursued and one of them fell into the river Tigres in Peloponnese, the river that is now called Harpys after her; some call her Nicothoe, but others Aellopus. But the other, named Ocypete or, according to others, Ocythoe (but Hesiod calls her Ocypode) fled by the Propontis till she came to the Echinadian Islands, which are now called Strophades after her; for when she came to them she turned (estraphe) and being at the shore fell for very weariness with her pursuer. But Apollonius in the Argonautica says that the Harpies were pursued to the Strophades Islands and suffered no harm, having sworn an oath that they would wrong Phineus no more. Eventually, the Argonauts freed Phineus from the punishment.

=== The clashing rocks ===
Being rid of the Harpies, Phineus revealed to the Argonauts the course of their voyage, and advised them about the Symplegades. These were huge rocky cliffs, which, dashed together by the force of the winds, closed the sea passage. Thick was the mist that swept over them, and loud the crash, and it was impossible for even the birds to pass between them. So he told them to let fly a dove between the rocks, and, if they saw it pass safe through, to thread the narrows with an easy mind, but if they saw it perish, then not to force a passage. When they heard that, they put to sea, and on nearing the rocks let fly a dove from the prow, and as she flew the clash of the rocks nipped off the tip of her tail. So, waiting till the rocks had recoiled, with hard rowing and the help of Hera, they passed through, the extremity of the ship&#x27;s ornamented poop being shorn away right round. Henceforth the Clashing Rocks stood still; for it was fated that, so soon as a ship had made the passage, they should come to rest completely.

=== Lycus ===
When the Argonauts entered the sea called Euxine through the Cyanean Cliffs (i.e. Clashing Rocks of the Symplegades), they arrived among the Mariandynians. There King Lycus received them kindly, grateful because they had killed Amycus, who had often attacked him. While the Argonauts were staying with Lycus and went out to gather straw, the seer Idmon, son of Apollo, was wounded by a wild boar and died. Also, on that island Tiphys died, and Ancaeus undertook to steer the ship.

=== Island of Dia ===
By the will of Hera they were borne to the island of Dia. There the Stymphalian Birds were wounding them, using their feathers as arrows. They were not able to cope with the great numbers of birds. Following Phineus&#x27; advice they seized shields and spears, and dispersed the birds by the noise, after the manner of the Curetes.

The Argonauts also found shipwrecked men on the island, naked and helpless—the sons of Phrixus and Chalciope—Argus, Phrontides, Melas, and Cylindrus. These told their misfortunes to Jason, how they had suffered shipwreck and been cast there when they were hastening to go to their grandfather Athamas, and Jason welcomed and aided them. And having sailed past the Thermodon and the Caucasus, they came to the river Phasis, which is in the Colchian land. The sons of Phrixus led Jason to land and bade the Argonauts to conceal the ship. They themselves went to their mother Chalciope, Medea&#x27;s sister, and made known the kindness of Jason, and why they had come. Then Chalciope told them about Medea, and brought her with her sons to Jason. When she saw Jason, Medea recognized him as the one she had loved deeply in dreams by Hera&#x27;s urging, and promised him everything. They brought him to the temple.

=== Aeëtes ===
An oracle told Aeëtes, son of Helios, that he would keep his kingdom as long as the fleece which Phrixus had dedicated remained at the shrine of Ares. When the ship was brought into port, Jason repaired to Aeëtes, and setting forth the charge laid on him by Pelias invited him to give him the fleece. The other promised to give it if single-handed he yoked with adamant the brazen-footed bulls. These were two wild bulls of enormous size that he had got as a gift of Hephaestus; they had brazen feet and puffed flames from their mouths and nostrils. These creatures Aeëtes ordered him to yoke and plow, and to sow from a helmet the dragon&#x27;s teeth; for he had got from Athena half of the dragon&#x27;s teeth which Cadmus sowed in Thebes. These tribe of armed men should arise and slay each other. While Jason puzzled how he could yoke the bulls, Hera wished to save him because once when she had come to a river and wished to test the minds of men, she assumed an old woman&#x27;s form, and asked to be carried across. He had carried her across when others who had passed over despised her. And so, since she knew that Jason could not perform the commands without help of Medea, she asked Aphrodite to inspire Medea, daughter of Aeëtes and the Oceanid Idyia, with love.

At Aphrodite&#x27;s instigation, the witch conceived a passion for the man. Fearing that Jason might be destroyed by the bulls, she, keeping the thing from her father, promised to help him yoke the bulls and deliver the fleece to him. Medea also asked the hero to swear to have her become his wife and take her with him on the voyage to Greece. When Jason swore to do so, she aided him to be freed from all danger, for she gave him a drug with which she bade him anoint his shield, spear, and body when he was about to yoke the bulls; for she said that, anointed with it, for a single day he could be harmed neither by fire nor by iron. She signified to him that when the teeth were sown, armed men would spring up from the ground against him; and when he saw a knot of them he was to throw stones into their midst from a distance. When the men fought each other about that, he was taken to kill them. On hearing that, Jason anointed himself with the drug. He arrived to the grove of the temple and sought the bulls. And, even though they charged him with a flame of fire, he managed to yoke them. Then, when he had sown the teeth, armed men rose from the ground; and where he saw several together, he pelted them unseen with stones, and when they fought each other, he drew near and slew them. However, though the bulls were yoked, Aeëtes did not give Jason the fleece for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew. But before he could do so, Medea brought Jason by night to the shrine. Having lulled the dragon that guarded it to sleep with her drugs, she possessed herself of the fleece. In Jason&#x27;s company, she came to the Argo, and the Argonauts put to sea by night to set off to their country.

=== Apsyrtus ===
Medea was attended by her brother Apsyrtus when they escaped from Colchis. When he discovered the daring deeds done by Medea, he started off in pursuit of the ship. Medea noticed her brother&#x27;s ship and murdered him. Then, she cut his body limb from limb and threw the pieces into the deep. Gathering his child&#x27;s limbs, Aeëtes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi. He sent out many of the Colchians to search for the Argo, threatening that if they did not bring Medea to him, they should suffer the punishment due to her; so they separated and pursued the search in diverse places. When the Argonauts were already sailing past the Eridanus river, Zeus, in his anger at the murder of Apsyrtus, sent a furious storm upon them which drove them out of their course. And, as they were sailing past the Apsyrtides Islands, the ship spoke, saying that the wrath of Zeus would not cease unless they journeyed to Ausonia and were purified by Circe for the murder of Apsyrtus. So when they had sailed past the Ligurian and Celtic nations and had voyaged through the Sardinian Sea, they skirted Tyrrhenia and came to Aeaea, where they supplicated Circe and were purified.

=== Sirens ===
As the Argonauts sailed past the Sirens, Orpheus restrained them by chanting a counter-melody. Butes alone swam off to the Sirens, but Aphrodite carried him away and settled him in Lilybaion. After the Sirens, the ship encountered Charybdis and Scylla and the Wandering Rocks, above which a great flame and smoke were seen rising. Thetis with the Nereids steered the ship safely through them at the summons of Hera.

=== Phaeacians ===

Having passed by the Island of Thrinacia, where are the kine of the Sun, they came to Corcyra, the island of the Phaeacians, of which Alcinous was king. But when the Colchians could not find the ship, some of them settled at the Ceraunian mountains, and some journeyed to Illyria and colonized the Apsyrtides Islands. But some came to the Phaeacians, and finding the Argo there, they demanded of Alcinous that he should give up Medea. He answered, that if she already knew Jason, he would give her to him, but that if she were still a maid he would send her away to her father. However, Arete, wife of Alcinous, anticipated matters by marrying Medea to Jason.

In some accounts, however, Absyrtus with armed guards was sent in pursuit of the Argo by his father Aeëtes. When the latter had caught up with her in the Adriatic Sea in Histria at King Alcinous&#x27; court, and would fight for her, Alcinous intervened to prevent their fighting. They took him as arbiter, and he put them off till the next day. When he seemed depressed and Arete, his wife, asked him the cause of his sadness, he said he had been made arbiter by two different states, to judge between Colchians and Argives. When Arete asked him what judgment he would give, Alcinous replied that if Medea were a virgin, he would give her to her father, but if not, to her husband. When Arete heard this from her husband, she sent word to Jason, and he lay with Medea by night in a cave. Then next day when they came to court, and Medea was found to be a wife she was given to her husband. Nevertheless, when they had left, Absyrtus, fearing his father&#x27;s commands, pursued them to the island of Athena. When Jason was sacrificing there to Athena, and Absyrtus came upon him, he was killed by Jason. Medea gave him burial, and they departed. The Colchians who had come with Absyrtus, fearing Aeëtes, settled down among the Phaeacians and founded a town which from Absyrtus&#x27; name they called Absoros. Now this island is located in Histria, opposite Pola.

Sailing by night, the Argonauts encountered a violent storm, and Apollo, taking his stand on the Melantian ridges, flashed lightning down, shooting a shaft into the sea. Then they perceived an island close at hand, and anchoring there they named it Anaphe, because it had loomed up (anaphanenai) unexpectedly. So they founded an altar of Radiant Apollo, and having offered sacrifice they betook them to feasting; and twelve handmaids, whom Arete had given to Medea, jested merrily with the chiefs; whence it is still customary for the women to jest at the sacrifice.

=== Talos ===
Putting to sea from there, they were hindered from touching at Crete by Talos. Some say that he was a man of the Brazen Race, others that he was given to Minos by Hephaestus; he was a brazen man, but some say that he was a bull. He had a single vein extending from his neck to his ankles, and a bronze nail was rammed home at the end of the vein. This Talos kept guard, running round the island thrice every day; wherefore, when he saw the Argo standing inshore, he pelted it as usual with stones. His death was brought about by the wiles of Medea, whether, as some say, she drove him mad by drugs, or, as others say, she promised to make him immortal and then drew out the nail, so that all the ichor gushed out and he died. But some say that Poeas shot him dead in the ankle.

=== Homecoming ===
After tarrying a single night there, they put in to Aigina to draw water, and a contest arose among them concerning the drawing of the water. Thence they sailed betwixt Euboea and Locris and came to Iolcus, having completed the whole voyage in four months.

=== Alternative stories for the returned route ===
Sozomen wrote that when the Argonauts left from the Aeëtes, they returned from a different route, crossed the sea of Scythia, sailed through some of the rivers there, and when they were near the shores of Italy, they built a city in order to stay at the winter, which they called Emona (), part of modern-day Ljubljana in Slovenia. At summer, with the assistance of the locals, they dragged the Argo to the Aquilis river (), which falls into the Eridanus. The Eridanus itself falls into the Adriatic Sea.

Zosimus wrote that after they left from the Aeëtes, they arrived at the mouth of the Ister river which it discharges itself into the Black Sea and they went up that river against the stream, by the help of oars and convenient gales of wind. After they managed to do it, they built the city of Emona as a memorial of their arrival there. Afterwards placing the Argo, on machines they drew it as far as the sea-side and from there they went at the Thessalian shore.

Pliny the Elder wrote that some writers claim that the Argo came down some river into the Adriatic Sea, not far from Tergeste but that river is now unknown. While other writers say that the ship was carried across the Alps on men&#x27;s shoulders, having passed along the Ister river, then along the Savus river, and then to Nauportus which is lying between the Emona and the Alps.

== Legacy ==
The Porto Ferraio on the island of Elba, was known in ancient times as the portus Argous (Ἀργῶος λιμήν), because it was believed that the Argonauts landed there on their return voyage, while sailing in quest of Circe.

<doc id="77335" wikidata="Q212262" url="?curid=77335" title="Golden Fleece">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Golden Fleece () is the fleece of the golden-woolled, winged ram, Chrysomallos, that rescued Phrixus and brought him to Colchis, where Phrixus then sacrificed it to Zeus. Phrixus gave the fleece to King Aeëtes who kept it in a sacred grove, whence Jason and the Argonauts stole it with the help of Medea, Aeëtes&#x27; daughter. The fleece is a symbol of authority and kingship.

In the historical account, the hero Jason and his crew of Argonauts set out on a quest for the fleece by order of King Pelias in order to place Jason rightfully on the throne of Iolcus in Thessaly. Through the help of Medea, they acquire the Golden Fleece. The story is of great antiquity and was current in the time of Homer (eighth century BC). It survives in various forms, among which the details vary.

Nowadays, the heraldic variations of the Golden Fleece are featured frequently in Georgia, especially for Coats of Arms and Flags associated with Western Georgian (Historical Colchis) municipalities and cities, including the Coats of Arms of City of Kutaisi, the ancient capital city of Colchis.

==Plot==

Athamas the founder of Thessaly, but also king of the city of Orchomenus in Boeotia (a region of southeastern Greece), took the goddess Nephele as his first wife. They had two children, the boy Phrixus (whose name means &quot;curly&quot;, as in the texture of the ram&#x27;s fleece) and the girl Helle. Later Athamas became enamored of and married Ino, the daughter of Cadmus. When Nephele left in anger, drought came upon the land.

Ino was jealous of her stepchildren and plotted their deaths; in some versions, she persuaded Athamas that sacrificing Phrixus was the only way to end the drought. Nephele, or her spirit, appeared to the children with a winged ram whose fleece was of gold. The ram had been sired by Poseidon in his primitive ram-form upon Theophane, a nymph and the granddaughter of Helios, the sun-god. According to Hyginus, Poseidon carried Theophane to an island where he made her into a ewe so that he could have his way with her among the flocks. There Theophane&#x27;s other suitors could not distinguish the ram-god and his consort.

Nephele&#x27;s children escaped on the yellow ram over the sea, but Helle fell off and drowned in the strait now named after her, the Hellespont. The ram spoke to Phrixus, encouraging him, and took the boy safely to Colchis (modern-day south-east coastal region of the Black Sea), on the easternmost shore of the Euxine (Black) Sea.
There the ram was sacrificed to gods.
In essence, this act returned the ram to the god Poseidon, and the ram became the constellation Aries.

Phrixus settled in the house of Aeëtes, son of Helios the sun god. He hung the Golden Fleece preserved from the ram on an oak in a grove sacred to Ares, the god of war and one of the Twelve Olympians. The fleece was guarded by a never-sleeping dragon with teeth that could become soldiers when planted in the ground. The dragon was at the foot of the tree on which the fleece was placed.

In some versions of the story, Jason attempts to put the guard serpent to sleep.

==Evolution of plot==
Pindar employed the quest for the Golden Fleece in his Fourth Pythian Ode (written in 462 BC), though the fleece is not in the foreground. When Aeëtes challenges Jason to yoke the fire-breathing bulls, the fleece is the prize: &quot;Let the King do this, the captain of the ship! Let him do this, I say, and have for his own the immortal coverlet, the fleece, glowing with matted skeins of gold&quot;.

In later versions of the story, the ram is said to have been the offspring of the sea god Poseidon and Themisto (less often, Nephele or Theophane). The classic telling is the &quot;Argonautica&quot; of Apollonius of Rhodes, composed in the mid-third century BC Alexandria, recasting early sources that have not survived. Another, much less-known Argonautica, using the same body of myth, was composed in Latin by Valerius Flaccus during the time of Vespasian.

Where the written sources fail, through accidents of history, sometimes the continuity of a mythic tradition can be found among the vase-painters. The story of the Golden Fleece appeared to have little resonance for Athenians of the Classic age, for only two representations of it on Attic-painted wares of the fifth century have been identified: a &quot;krater&quot; at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a &quot;kylix&quot; in the Vatican collections. In the &quot;kylix&quot; painted by Douris, –470, Jason is being disgorged from the mouth of the dragon, a detail that does not fit easily into the literary sources; behind the dragon, the fleece hangs from an apple tree. Jason&#x27;s helper in the Athenian vase-paintings is not Medea— who had a history in Athens as the opponent of Theseus—but Athena.

==Interpretations==
Several euhemeristic attempts to interpret the Golden Fleece &quot;realistically&quot; as reflecting some physical cultural object or alleged historical practice have been made. For example, in the 20th century, some scholars suggested that the story of the Golden Fleece signified the bringing of sheep husbandry to Greece from the east; in other readings, scholars theorized it referred to golden grain, or to the Sun.
A more widespread interpretation relates the myth of the fleece to a method of washing gold from streams, which was well attested (but only from ) in the region of Georgia to the east of the Black Sea. Sheep fleeces, sometimes stretched over a wooden frame, would be submerged in the stream, and gold flecks borne down from upstream placer deposits would collect in them. The fleeces would be hung in trees to dry before the gold was shaken or combed out. Alternatively, the fleeces would be used on washing tables in alluvial mining of gold or on washing tables at deep gold mines. Judging by the very early gold objects from a range of cultures, washing for gold is a very old human activity.

Strabo describes the way in which gold could be washed:
It is said that in their country gold is carried down by the mountain torrents, and that the barbarians obtain it by means of perforated troughs and fleecy skins, and that this is the origin of the myth of the golden fleece—unless they call them Iberians, by the same name as the western Iberians, from the gold mines in both countries.

Another interpretation is based on the references in some versions to purple or purple-dyed cloth. The purple dye extracted from the purple dye murex snail and related species was highly prized in ancient times. Clothing made of cloth dyed with Tyrian purple was a mark of great wealth and high station (hence the phrase &quot;royal purple&quot;). The association of gold with purple is natural and occurs frequently in literature.

===Main theories===

The following are the chief among the various interpretations of the fleece, with notes on sources and major critical discussions:

# It represents royal power.
# It represents the flayed skin of Krios (&#x27;Ram&#x27;), companion of Phrixus.
# It represents a book on alchemy.
# It represents a technique of writing in gold on parchment.
# It represents a form of placer mining practiced in Georgia, for example.
# It represents the forgiveness of the Gods.
# It represents a rain cloud.
# It represents a land of golden grain.
# It represents the spring-hero.
# It represents the sea reflecting the sun.
# It represents the gilded prow of Phrixus&#x27; ship.
# It represents a breed of sheep in ancient Georgia.
# It represents the riches imported from the East.
# It represents the wealth or technology of Colchis.
# It was a covering for a cult image of Zeus in the form of a ram.
# It represents a fabric woven from sea silk.
# It is about a voyage from Greece, through the Mediterranean, across the Atlantic to the Americas.
# It represents trading fleece dyed murex-purple for Georgian gold.

<text>The Irminones, also referred to as Herminones or Hermiones (), were a large group of early Germanic tribes settling in the Elbe watershed and by the first century AD expanding into Bavaria, Swabia, and Bohemia. Notably this included the large sub-group of the Suevi, that itself contained many different tribal groups, but the Irminones also included for example the Chatti.

The term Irminonic therefore is also used as a term for Elbe Germanic, which is one of the proposed (but unattested) dialect groups ancestral to the West Germanic language family, especially the High German languages, which include modern Standard German.

== History of use ==
=== Classical ===
The name Irminones or Hermiones comes from Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot; (AD 98), where he categorized them as one of the tribes that some people say were descended from Mannus, and noted that they lived in the interior of Germania. Other Germanic groups of tribes were the Ingvaeones, living on the coast, and Istvaeones, who accounted for the rest. Tacitus also mentioned the Suebi as a large grouping who included the Semnones, the Quadi, and the Marcomanni, but he did not say precisely to which (if any) of the three nations they belonged.

Pomponius Mela, in his &quot;Description of the World&quot; (III.3.31) described the Hermiones as the farthest people of Germania, beyond both the Cimbri and Teutones who lived on the Codanus sinus, which is understood today to have been his name for the Baltic Sea and Kattegat, although it was described by him as a very large bay filled with islands, east of the Elbe river. Still farther east Mela describes the Sarmatians whom he places west of the Vistula, and then the Scythians whom he places east of the Vistula.

Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (4.100) claimed that the Irminones included the Suebi, Hermunduri, Chatti, and Cherusci.

=== Medieval ===
In the so-called Frankish Table of Nations (c. 520), probably a Byzantine creation, the son of Mannus, who was the ancestor of the Irminones, is named Erminus (or Armen, Ermenius, Ermenus, Armenon, Ermeno, as it appears in various manuscripts). He is said to have fathered the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Vandals, Gepids, and Saxons. In a variation on the table that appears in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, the Vandals and Saxons have been replaced by the Burgundians and Langobards.

They may have differentiated into the tribes Alamanni, Hermunduri, Marcomanni, Quadi, and Suebi by the first century AD. By that time the Suebi, Marcomanni, and Quadi had moved southwest into the area of modern-day Bavaria and Swabia. In 8 BC, the Marcomanni and Quadi drove the Boii out of Bohemia.

The term Suebi is usually applied to all the groups who moved into this area, although later in history (around 200 AD) the term Alamanni (meaning &quot;all-men&quot;) became more commonly applied to the group.

&quot;Jǫrmunr&quot;, the Viking Age Norse form of the name &quot;&quot;, can be found in a number of places in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; as a by-name for Odin. Some aspects of the Irminones culture and beliefs may be inferred from their relationships with the Roman Empire, from Widukind&#x27;s confusion over whether Irmin was comparable to Mars or Hermes, and from Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s allusions, at the beginning of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, to Odin&#x27;s cult having appeared first in Germany before spreading up into the Ingvaeonic North.

<text>Theodelinda also spelled &quot;Theudelinde&quot; ( 570–628 AD), was a queen of the Lombards by marriage to two consecutive Lombard rulers, Autari and then Agilulf, and regent of Lombardia during the minority of her son Adaloald, and co-regent when he reached majority, from 616 to 626. For well over thirty years, she exercised influence across the Lombard realm, which comprised most of Italy between the Apennines and the Alps. Born a Frankish Catholic, she convinced her first spouse Autari to convert from pagan beliefs to Christianity.

==Life==
She was the daughter of duke Garibald I of Bavaria and Waldrada.
Born a Bavarian princess to King Garibald, Theodelinda&#x27;s heritage included being descended on her mother&#x27;s side from the previous Lombard king, Waco, whose family had ruled seven generations prior according tradition.

===First marriage===
Theodelinda was married first in 588 to Authari, king of the Lombards, son of King Cleph. There are indications that Pope Gregory I may have had an interest in encouraging this marriage as it would tie a Bavarian Catholic with the Arian Lombards, something he did previously, when he promoted the marriage between the Frankish princess Bertha—great-granddaughter of Clovis I—and the Kentish Aethelbehrt. Theodelinda&#x27;s time with Authari was brief for he died in 590.

===Second marriage===

So highly esteemed across the Lombard kingdom was Theodelinda that when Authari died, she was asked to remain in power and to choose a successor. Historian Roger Collins has misgivings with this claim—which stems from Paul the Deacon—and instead, asserts that both political bargaining or naked force were more likely attributable to her choice. Whatever the real situation, a mere two months after Authari&#x27;s death, Theodelinda picked Agilulf as her next husband and the two were wed. She thereafter exerted much influence in restoring Nicene Christianity to a position of primacy in Italy against its rival, Arian Christianity. Her reach extended across most of the Italian peninsula between the Apennines and the Alps.

While her husband Agilulf retained his Arian faith, he allowed his son with Theodelinda to be baptized a Catholic. The Lombard king faced trouble from his dukes, who were convinced that he had consigned himself instead to the faith of the conquered. Agilulf did not permit Theodelinda&#x27;s faith to shape his policies against the Byzantines. Frequently, Theodelinda corresponded with Pope Gregory (590–604) in letters, some of which are recorded by the eighth-century historian, Paul the Deacon. Some of the content in these letters concerned her husband&#x27;s conversion. To further promulgate the Christian faith of the Catholics, she also welcomed Catholic missionaries across her realm. Taking full advantage of her piety and possibly to incentivize her continued Catholic proclivities, Pope Gregory sent her a series of silver ampullas of Syro-Palestinian craftsmanship, a gospel casket, and a golden cross from Byzantium. The cross was gem-encrusted and was meant as a symbol of the &quot;impending Kingdom of God&quot;.

===Regent===
Shortly before Agilulf&#x27;s death in 616, he named Theodelinda co-regent for their son Adaloald and once he reached maturity, she remained co-ruler over the kingdom.

For a period of some thirty-five years Theodelinda was queen of the Lombards. Perhaps to further exhibit her faith, she constructed a Catholic cathedral dedicated to St. John the Baptist at Monza (near Milan) and richly endowed it. Her support for the Catholic faith also included the establishment of monasteries—one at Bobbio, and later one at Pedona, among others according to Paul the Deacon.

Within &quot;the treasure house&quot; that is the cathedral at Monza, one finds a splendidly detailed sculpture of a mother hen and her chicks made of gilded silver, which was likely another gift from Pope Gregory.

<doc id="77343" wikidata="Q308885" url="?curid=77343" title="Quadi">
<text>The Quadi were a Germanic people during the Roman era, who were prominent in Greek and Roman records from about 20 AD to about 400 AD. By about 20 AD they had a kingdom centred in the area of present-day western Slovakia, north of the Roman border on the Danube river. After probably first settling near the Morava river the Quadi expanded their control eastwards over time until they also stretched into present day Hungary. This was part of the bigger region which had been partly vacated a generation earlier by the Celtic Boii, and their opponents the Dacians. The Quadi were the easternmost of a series of four related Suebian kingdoms that established themselves near the river frontier after 9 BC, during a period of major Roman invasions into both western Germania to the northwest of it, and Pannonia to the south of it. The other three were the Hermunduri, Naristi (also known as Varisti), and the Quadi&#x27;s powerful western neighbours the Marcomanni. Despite frequent difficulties with the Romans, the Quadi survived to become an important cultural bridge between the peoples of Germania to the north, the Roman Empire to the south, and the Sarmatian peoples, most notably the Iazyges, who settled in the same period to their east in present day Hungary. 

The Marcomannic wars, during the reign of the emperor Marcus Aurelius and his co-emperors, involved several rounds of particularly destructive conflict against the Quadi and their neighbours, who at one point even invaded Italy itself. By 180 AD when the emperor died on campaign in this region, there were new peace agreements between Rome and the Quadi, but these did not resolve the longer term problems which the region continued to face. Populations from more distant regions periodically disrupted the area, increasing tensions with Rome. Small scale raiding from the neighbouring Sarmatian plain into Roman Pannonia continued, and this played a role in triggering more conflicts between the Quadi and Romans in the third and fourth centuries. However, while the original Marcomanni settlements in the northern Bohemian forest subsequently shrunk and became less important, the Quadi thrived near the Danube, and became more culturally integrated with both their Roman and Sarmatian neighbours.

In the fifth century the Marcomanni and Quadi names disappear from contemporary records. After about 380 AD their Middle Danubian region was dominated by peoples who had migrated from eastern Europe, most notably the Huns, Alans and Goths. In 395 AD however, Saint Jerome listed the Quadi and their neighbours the Sarmatians, Marcomanni, and Vandals, as peoples who had recently been ransacking the nearby Roman provinces together with these newcomers. In 409 he placed the Quadi, Vandals, Sarmatians, Heruli, and even inhabitants of Roman Pannonia, in another list of peoples who had recently moved west and occupied parts of Gaul. These were the last clear contemporary records of the Quadi doing anything under their old name. Given their presence in Gaul in 409 AD the Quadi are considered likely to have been prominent among the Suevi who moved west into Iberia by 409 AD and founded the Kingdom of the Suebi in Gallaecia, in present day Spain and Portugal. This Gallaecian kingdom lasted for more than a century, until it was defeated by the Visigoths, and integrated into their kingdom in 585. 

Meanwhile, until he died in 453, the empire of Attila controlled the Middle Danubian region. Smaller kingdoms were subsequently founded in or near the old Marcomanni and Quadi kingdoms, by the &quot;Danube Suevi&quot;, as well as the Rugii, Heruli and Sciri. These &quot;Danube Suevi&quot; are likely to have included descendants of the Quadi, Marcomanni and other Suebian peoples of the region. Their short-lived independent kingdom was defeated by Ostrogoths at the Battle of Bolia in 469. Many of them apparently moved westwards under their king Hunimund, into present-day western Austria and southern Germany, where they became allies of the Alemanni. Other Quadi are presumed to have remained in the Middle Danube region and adapted to the subsequent waves of conquerors, either among the remaining settled communities, or among the more mobile groups which were prominent during this &quot;migration period&quot;. Like their neighbours the Heruli, Rugii and Sciri, many probably became followers of the large forces which successfully invaded Italy from the Middle Danube under Odoacer (476), Theoderic the Great (493), and finally the Suebian Langobards (starting in 568), who are believed to have integrated Danubian Suebi into their ranks before moving into Italy.

==Name==
According to the &quot;Germanische Altertumskunde Online&quot;, the etymologies proposed for the ethnonym are all fraught with difficulties:
*Since Jacob Grimm (d. 1863), it has often been assumed that this ethnonym is related to the Dutch adjective &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;angry, bad, evil, wrong, poor quality&quot; - versions of which are also found in medieval German and English. However, this would be a surprising choice of name, because it has such a negative meaning. It could therefore perhaps have started as a name given by their enemies, and it might have continued as a name intended to evoke fear.
*The name has also often been associated with Germanic verbs such as English &quot;quoth&quot;, originally the past tense of medieval &quot;&quot;, which meant &quot;say&quot; or &quot;declare&quot; (preserved in the modern word &quot;bequeath&quot;). However, the precise meaning of this word as an ethnonym is unclear in this case.
*Wolfgang Krause proposed that the ethnonym might originally belong to Germanic &quot;hwatjan&quot;, meaning &quot;to incite&quot;. However, the form of the ethnonym as it appears in ancient sources would then not show show the expected Germanic First Sound Shift.

==First reports and location==
The Quadi start to appear in contemporary works only after their neighbours the Marcomanni settled in central Bohemia. This happened after their defeat during the Germania campaign of the elder Drusus in about 9 BC. The defeated Marcomanni soon received a new king Maroboduus, who had been brought up in Rome. He proceeded to lead his own people and their Suebian allies into more isolated regions in the present day Czech Republic, which was surrounded by forests and mountains. It is possible that the name &quot;Quadi&quot; was new, and that the same group had previously been one of those mentioned in Roman accounts under the more general name &quot;Suebi&quot;. This was for example the name given to one of the groups who the Romans defeated in the battle after they defeated the Marcomanni in 9 BC. 

While the literary and archaeological evidence is not perfectly clear, it is most often presumed that the Quadi first settled in Moravia around the same time that the Marcomanni settled in Bohemia. There is however a proposal that the Quadi moved into the Bohemian area before the Marcomanni, based on archaeological evidence of Elbe Germanic peoples in the region already before the Marcomanni defeat. The archaeological evidence left by these two peoples is similar, making it difficult to define the borders between them, but it confirms their connections with the Elbe &quot;Germani&quot;, who were living near the central Elbe river and the Saale. The archaeological material culture which unites these groups, and distinguishes them from the previous Celtic inhabitants, is referred to as the &quot;Grossromstedt horizon&quot;. It was influenced not only by the older Jastorf culture of this region, but also by the Przeworsk culture from further east in present day Poland. The variant which developed in the old Boii lands is called the Plaňany-Group, and also shows the residual influence of their older Celtic La Tène culture of the Boii, which had itself already come under Przeworsk influence in the generations before the Germanic influx.

The evidence indicates that the Quadi initially lived near the Morava river, in southwestern Slovakia, southern Moravia, and north-eastern Lower Austria. However, their population, perhaps divided into two distinct states, was later more concentrated to the east of the Little Carpathians, in what is now Slovakia, and they eventually extended as far as Vác in present-day Hungary. At its height, their kingdom also possibly stretched west into present-day Bohemia. Over time the eastern Quadi became an important cultural bridge between Romans, Sarmatians and the more distant peoples to the north and east.

Strabo, writing about 23 AD, appears to have written the earliest surviving mention of the Quadi, although aspects of the text are somewhat doubtful. Strabo described a mountain range running north of the Danube, like a smaller version of the Alps which runs south of it. Within it is the Hercynian forest, and within this forest are tribes of Suebi &quot;such as the tribes of the &quot;Coldui&quot; [καθάπερ τὰ τῶν κολδούων], in whose territory lies &quot;Buiaimon&quot; [Βουίαιμον, the original &quot;Bohemia&quot;], the royal seat of Maroboduus&quot;. King Maroboduus, he wrote, had led several peoples into this forested region, including his own people the Marcomanni. He therefore became ruler of Suevi peoples in this forested region, and also over other Suevi living outside it. Not only is Strabo&#x27;s spelling of Quadi with an &quot;L&quot; unexpected when compared to later references, but also the implication that Maroboduus lived within Quadi territory. Errors are therefore suspected in the surviving text.

A contemporary of Strabo, Velleius Paterculus, didn&#x27;t mention the Quadi by name but described &quot;Boiohaemum&quot;, where Maroboduus and the Marcomanni lived, as &quot;plains surrounded by the Hercynian forest&quot;, and he said this was the only part of Germania which the Romans did not control in the period before the Roman defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. Velleius also remarked that Maroboduus subjugated all his neighbours either by war or treaty. Hofeneder notes that many modern scholars interpret this to mean that the Quadi were also under his overlordship. Although there is no consensus about this, it is in any case clear that the two peoples were always closely connected during the many centuries in which they appear in records. 

Velleius said that Maroboduus drilled his Bohemian soldiers to almost Roman standards, and that although his policy was to avoid conflict with Rome, the Romans came to be concerned that he could invade Italy. &quot;Races and individuals who revolted from us [the Romans] found in him a refuge.&quot; From a Roman point of view he noted that the closest point of access to Bohemia was via Carnuntum. This was between present-day Vienna and Bratislava, and near the Quadi territory where the Morava river enters the Danube.

The Quadi leader at the time when Maroboduus moved to Bohemia was apparently named Tudrus. He is mentioned only by Tacitus, who is also the first author to clearly mention the Quadi in ancient records. Although archaeological evidence indicates that the Marcomanni and Quadi entered the area after the old Boii population was much reduced already, Tacitus claimed that they drove the Boii out and won their country by valour. He also remarked that their kings were still from the same old family (or families):
The Marcomanni and Quadi have, up to our time, been ruled by kings of their own nation, descended from the noble stock of Maroboduus and Tudrus. They now submit even to foreigners; but the strength and power of the monarch depend on Roman influence. He is occasionally supported by our arms, more frequently by our money, and his authority is none the less. [&quot;Marcomanis Quadisque usque ad nostram memoriam reges manserunt ex gente ipsorum, nobile Marobodui et Tudri genus (iam et externos patiuntur), sed vis et potentia regibus ex auctoritate Romana. raro armis nostris, saepius pecunia iuvantur, nec minus valent.&quot;]

To the east of the Quadi Strabo mentioned that the Suevian neighbours of Maroboduus bordered upon the &quot;Getae&quot;, which in this case refers to the Dacians. Later, Pliny the Elder mentioned that the Dacians had been pushed east to the Tisza, into the mountainous country (later referred to as Dacia) by the Sarmatian Iazyges. Pliny expressed doubt about whether the boundary between the Iazyges on the one hand, and the Suevi and the kingdom of Vannius on the other, was the Morava river or else the &quot;Duria&quot;, which is a river that is no longer clearly identifiable. The 2nd-century Greek geographer Ptolemy similarly placed the Quadi on the edge of Germania, defining the &quot;Sarmatian mountains&quot; (Σαρματικὰ ὄρη) as the border, which he understood to run in a north-easterly direction from the sharp bend in the Danube to the &quot;head of the Vistula&quot; (κεφαλῆς τοῦ Οὐιστούλα), though present day Slovakia.

Ptolemy lists several neighbours of the Quadi living along this border of Germania. Between the Elbe and the head of the Vistula, but south of the Asciburgius mountains, lived the Corconti and the Buri, south of these were the Sidones, then the Cogni (perhaps the Cotini), and then the Visburgii, and south of this group was the Hercynian valley. South of this forested valley were the Quadi, and south of them were iron mines and the Luna Forest. The southern neighbours of the Quadi were the &quot;large nation&quot; of the Baemi up to the Danube, and next to them along the river are the Rakatri, and then the Rakatai who live near the &quot;kampoi&quot; (), which could mean &quot;the plains&quot; but may have referred to the bend in the Danube, a people named the Kampi, or the river Kamp near Vienna. The Baemi () were probably the &quot;Bohemians&quot; who were by that time living in the kingdom of Vannius. West of the Hercynian forest is the Gambreta forest and south of this, west of the Quadi, were the Marcomanni, and south of them, west of the Baemi, were a people called the Sudini, and south these on the Danube were the Adrabaecampi, which might not be a tribal name, and is in any case probably related to the word &quot;Kampi&quot; used in relation to the Rakatai.

Somewhat differently, Tacitus named four peoples living the north of the Marcomanni and Quadi, the Marsigni, Cotini (or &quot;Gotini&quot;), Osi, and Buri, dwelling in a range of mountains running from west to east through &quot;Suevia&quot;, separating them from a large group of Germanic peoples named the Lugii. According to him the Osi and Cotini did not speak Germanic languages and worked the mines, paying the Quadi and Sarmatians tribute.

==First century AD==

In &quot;The Annals&quot;, Tacitus recounts that Maroboduus was deposed by an exiled noble named Catualda around 18 AD. Catualda was in turn defeated by the Hermunduri king, Vibilius.The subjects of Maroboduus and Catualda were moved by the Romans to an area near the Danube, between the Morava and &quot;Cusus&quot; rivers, and placed under the control of the Quadian king Vannius. There are proposals that the Romans were deliberately trying to create a buffer state with this settlement, but there is no consensus about this. The area where Vannius ruled over the Marcomanni exiles is generally considered to have been a distinct state to the Quadi kingdom itself. Unfortunately the Cusus river has not been identified with certainty. However, Slovak archaeological research locates the core area of the Vannius kingdom in the fertile southwestern Slovakian lowlands around Trnava, east of the Little Carpathians. The swampy zone between the Little Carpathians and Danube provided an obstacle for possible attacks from non-Roman Pannonia. 

Geographically, Pliny the Elder saw the Quadi area as the edge of Germania, with the Iazyges sitting outside of it, and the kingdom of Vannius within it. In line with this, Ptolemy (2.11.11) mentions a &quot;great nation&quot; of Baimoi (Βαῖμοι) between the Quadi and the Danube, and these are likely to be the subjects of Vannius who originated from Bohemia.

Vannius personally benefitted from the new situation and became very wealthy and unpopular. He was himself eventually also deposed by Vibilius and the Hermunduri, together with the neighbouring Lugii, in 50/51 AD. Vannius&#x27;s soldiers during this conflict are described here as infantry, but he also called for cavalry from his Sarmatian allies, the Iazyges. This was coordinated with his nephews Vangio and Sido, who then divided his realm between themselves as loyal Roman client kings. Vannius was defeated and fled with his followers across the Danube, where they were assigned land in Roman Pannonia. This settlement is convincingly associated with Germanic finds from the 1st century AD in Burgenland, west of Lake Neusiedl, within Roman Pannonia. Quadi soldiers subsequently participated second battle of Bedriacum under Sido and Italicus, perhaps the son of Vangio, in 69 AD at Cremona in Italy. An influx of North Italian green-glazed ceramics into southwestern Slovakia might be a result of the troops in Italy.

Tacitus reported in the late first century that the Osi, who spoke a language similar to the Pannonian Aravisci who lived near present day Budapest, and the Cotini, a Celtic-speaking people, mined iron in the mountainous regions north of the Quadi, in present day Slovakia, and paid tribute to the Quadi and their Sarmatian allies in present day Hungary. Also in these mountainous regions Tacitus places the Buri tribe, who Tacitus describes as speaking a similar Suebian language. In the second century the geographer Ptolemy described the position of the Buri as being near the sources of the Vistula river.

Despite the occasional tensions, the Quadi and their Suebi neighbours had a relatively stable relationship with the Romans as a client state during this period, but this was interrupted under emperor Domitian during the years 89-97, after the Quadi and Marcomanni refused to assist in a conflict against the Dacians. According to Dio Cassius, Domitian reacted by entering Pannonia to make war, killed the peace envoys sent to him, but was then defeated by the Marcomanni. This campaign was referred to as the war against the Suebi, or the Suebi and Sarmatians, or the Marcomanni, Quadi and Sarmatians. The relationship then stabilized again in the time of emperor Nerva.

== Second century ==
The relationship between the Romans and the Quadi and their neighbours was far more seriously and permanently disrupted during the long series of conflicts called the Marcomannic wars, which were fought mainly during the rule of emperor Marcus Aurelius (reigned 161-180). 

In the 150s or 160s, 6000 Langobardi (Lombards originally from present-day north Germany) and Obii (whose identity is uncertain) crossed the Lower Danube into Roman territory where they were quickly defeated. Dio Cassius reports that these events worried several of the barbarian nations. A group of them selected Ballomarius, king of the Marcomanni, and ten other representatives of the other nations, in a peace mission to the governor of Roman Pannonia. Oaths were sworn and the envoys returned home. Some scholars think the Quadi may have been involved in this raid, or at least allowed it to happen. However the Quadi and their neighbours were facing their own problems with raiders from further north, and had been trying for some time to get more support from the empire. On their side, the Romans were apparently planning for a Germania campaign, and knew that Italy itself was threatened by these pressures, but were deliberately diplomatic while they were occupied with the Parthian campaign in the Middle East, and badly affected by the Antonine plague. However, the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; especially blames the Marcomanni and Victohali for throwing everything into confusion while other tribes had been driven on by the more distant barbarians.
Although a Roman offensive could not start in 167, two new legions were raised and in 168 the two emperors, Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius, set out to cross the alps. Either in 167, &quot;before&quot; the Romans setting, or in 169, &quot;after&quot; the Romans came to a stop when Verus died, the Marcomanni and Quadi led a crossing of the Danube, and an attack into Italy itself. They destroyed Opitergium (present-day Oderzo) and put the important town of Aquileia under siege. Whatever the exact sequence of events, the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; says that with the Romans in action several kings of the barbarians retreated, and some of the barbarians put anti-Roman leaders to death. In particular, the Quadi, having lost their king, announced they would not confirm an elected successor without approval from the emperors.

Marcus Aurelius returned to Rome but headed north again in the autumn of 169. He established a Danubian headquarters in Carnuntum between present-day Vienna and Bratislava. From here he could receive embassies from the different peoples north of the Danube. Some were given the possibility to settle in the empire, others were recruited to fight on the Roman side. The Quadi were pacified, and in 171 they agreed to leave their coalition, and returned deserters and 13,000 prisoners of war. They supplied horses and cattle as war contributions, and promised not to allow Marcomanni or Jazyges passage through their territory. By 173 the Quadi had rebelled again, and they expelled their Roman-approved king Furtius, replaced by Ariogaisos. In a major battle between 172 and 174, a Roman force was almost defeated, until a sudden rainstorm allowed them to defeat the Quadi. The incident is well-known because of the account given by Dio Cassius, and on the Column of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. By 175 the cavalry from the Marcomanni, Naristae, and Quadi were forced to travel to the Middle East, and in 176 Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus held a triumph as victors over Germania and Sarmatia.

The situation remained disturbed in subsequent years. The Romans declared a new war in 177 and set off in 178, against the Marcomanni, Hermunduri, Sarmatians, and Quadi as specific enemies. Rome executed a successful and decisive battle against them in 179 at Laugaricio (present-day Trenčín in Slovakia) under the command of legate and procurator Marcus Valerius Maximianus. By 180 AD the Quadi and Marcomanni were in a state of occupation, with Roman garrisons of 20,000 men each permanently stationed in both countries. The Romans even blocked the mountain passes so that they could not migrate north to live with the Semnones. Marcus Aurelius was considering the creation of a new imperial province called Marcomannia when he died in 180.

==Third century==

Around 214/215 AD, Dio Cassius reports that because of raids into Pannonia, the emperor Caracalla invited the Quadi king Gaiobomarus to meet him, and then had him executed. According to this report Caracalla &quot;claimed that he had overcome the recklessness, greed, and treachery of the Germans by deceit, since these qualities could not be conquered by force&quot;, and he was proud of the &quot;enmity with the Vandili and the Marcomani, who had been friends, and in having executed Gaïobomarus&quot;.

During the reign of Philip the Arab (reigned 244-249), who cut off gifts which were being paid to Ukrainian Goths under the rule of Ostrogotha, the 6th century writer Jordanes believed that the Marcomanni were paying tribute to Ostrogotha, and the princes of the Quadi were effectively slaves of the Goths.

By the middle of the third century the Quadi seem to have rejected their client relationship with Rome, and they began a series of attacks which they organized together with their eastern neighbours the Sarmatians. Together they repeatedly attacked Illyricum. There was a Roman campaign against the Quadi in 283-284 AD, and as a result emperor Carinus (co-emperor 283-285) and Numerian (co-emperor 284-285) celebrated this as two personal triumphs in 283 and 284. Nevertheless the Quadi were again mentioned among attacking Germanic tribes in 285 AD. This situation seems to have been pacified in the time of Diocletian (reigned 284-305).

==Fourth century==
In the first part of the 4th century there is evidence that the Quadi had developed a better relationship with the Romans. Their region of influence spread down the Danube towards present-day Budapest and it seems that their economy support a wealthy Romanised nobility.
In 357 a new phase of confrontation began during the reign of Constantius II (reigned 337-361) which gives insight into the way in which the culture of the Quadi had changed. The Quadi and Sarmatians were making raids across the Danube into Roman Pannonia and Moesia. The account given by Ammianus Marcellinus shows that in this period the Quadi had become more accustomed to actions on horseback. He reported that the involved Quadi and Sarmatians &quot;were neighbours and had like customs and armour&quot;, &quot;better fitted for brigandage than for open warfare, have very long spears and cuirasses made from smooth and polished pieces of horn, fastened like scales to linen shirts&quot;. They had &quot;swift and obedient horses&quot; and they generally had more than one, &quot;to the end that an exchange may keep up the strength of their mounts and that their freshness may be renewed by alternate periods of rest&quot;. 

In 358 the emperor crossed the Danube and resistance quickly fell apart. The leaders who came to negotiate with the emperor represented different parts of the populations who had participated. An important one was prince Araharius, who ruled &quot;a part of the Transiugitani and the Quadi&quot;. An inferior of his was Usafer, a prominent noble, who led &quot;some of the Sarmatians&quot;. In the negotiations the emperor declared that the Sarmatians were Roman dependents and demanded hostages. He then learned that there had been social upheaval among the Sarmatians, and some of the nobility had even fled to other countries. He gave them a new king, Zizais, a young prince who was the first leader to surrender. He then met with Vitrodorus the son of Viduarius the King of the Quadi. They also gave hostages and they drew their swords &quot;which they venerate as gods&quot; in order to swear loyalty. As a next step he moved to the mouth of the Tisza and slaughtered or enslaved many of the Sarmatians who lived on the other side and had felt themselves protected by the river from the Romans. King Viduarius was probably king of the western Quadi. Constantius erected a triumphal arch in Carnuntium, today known as the Heidentor, but raids did not stop.

Some years after the death of Constantius, the new emperor Valentinian I (reigned 364-375) reinforced the borders. He fortified the northern and eastern banks of the Danube, and by 373 AD he ordered construction of a garrisoned fort within Quadi territory itself. In 374, when complaints from the Quadi delayed construction the Roman general charged with getting it done invited their king Gabinius to dinner and then murdered him. As Ammianus wrote &quot;the Quadi, who had long been quiet, were suddenly aroused to an outbreak&quot;. Neighbouring tribes including the Sarmatians sprung into action and began raids across the Danube, repulsing the Roman military&#x27;s first poorly coordinated attempts to confront them. 

Valentinian moved to the Danube border and went first to Carnuntum, which was damaged and deserted, and then Aquincum (now part of Budapest). He sent one force north into the Quadi heartlands, and took another force across the Danube near present-day Budapest, where the enemies had settlements, and they slaughtered everyone they could find. He then made his winter quarters on the Roman side of the Danube in Bregetio (present-day Komárom). Here Quadi envoys came to plead for peace. However, when they maintained that the building of a barrier was begun &quot;unjustly and without due occasion&quot;, which had roused rude spirits to anger, Valentinian was enraged, became sick, and died. This ended this round of conflict, and the Romans and Quadi were soon preoccupied with bigger problems in the Danubian region.

In 380 the Romans suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Adrianople, which was caused by a sudden movement of peoples including Goths, Alans and Huns coming from present-day Ukraine. According to Ammianus, the region of the Marcomanni and Quadi were among the areas first affected by the &quot;a savage horde of unknown peoples, driven from their abodes by sudden violence&quot;. Although there is no consensus about the details, the Romans tried new approaches to settling newcomers in large numbers. One of the armed groups responsible for the defeat, led by Alatheus and Saphrax, were settled into the Pannonian part of the Roman empire, near the Quadi homeland, and expected to do military service for Rome. 

It is not clear how the Quadi reacted to the changed situation, but their name no longer appears in the records of this region. It is however likely that many crossed into Roman territory while others participated in the large movements of mixed peoples which were happening on both sides of the Danube. After the death of emperor Theodosius I in 395, Saint Jerome listed the Marcomanni and Quadi together with several of the eastern peoples causing devastation in the Roman provinces stretching from Constantinople to the Julian Alps, including Dalmatia, and all the provinces of Pannonia: &quot;Goths and Sarmatians, Quadi and Alans, Huns and Vandals and Marcomanni&quot;. Claudian describes them crossing the frozen Danube with wagons, and then setting wagons rigged around themselves like a wall at the approach of the Roman commander Stilicho. He says that all the fertile lands between the Black Sea and Adriatic were subsequently like uninhabited deserts, specifically including Dalmatia and Pannonia. At the same time, the Gothic general Alaric I, who had loyally served with his Gothic troops under Theodosius I at the Battle of Frigidus only a few months early, was beginning his rebellion, and started leading his army south, first towards Constantinople, and later towards Greece. This was triggered by internal Roman conflicts after the death of Theodosius. Claudian claimed that they were all incited by an Eastern Roman consul and enemy of Stilicho, Rufinus. The exact connection between Alaric and those who crossed the Danube remains unclear.

== After the fourth century ==
===Second letter of Saint Jerome===

The last contemporary mention of the Quadi as an identifiable people is in another letter by Saint Jerome from 409, but it places them far from home. He lists them first among the peoples who were occupying Gaul at that time: &quot;Quadi, Vandals, Sarmatians, Alans, Gepids, Herules, Saxons, Burgundians, Allemanni and—alas! for the commonweal!—even Pannonians&quot;. Scholars note that apart from the Saxons, Burgundians and Alemanni, who were already well-known near the Rhine, and the Alans who were newcomers from Ukraine who had already played an important role in the Roman military, the others appear to have been long-term neighbours from the Middle Danube area. The Vandals and Sarmatians listed next after the Quadi are generally understood to include the Hasdingi Vandals and Sarmatians who had been eastern neighbours of the Quadi for centuries. The Pannonians from within the empire were the Quadi&#x27;s long-term neighbours to the south. The &quot;Cosmographia&quot; written by Julius Honorius, and &quot;Liber Generationis&quot;, indicate that the Heruli were already settled on the Danube near the Marcomanni and Quadi for some time. The Gepids had already settled somewhere near their future location in Dacia in the 3rd century, among the Quadi&#x27;s eastern neighbours. 

The chain of events which led to large numbers of Middle Danubian people to suddenly move west along the Danube, towards Gaul, are not well understood but several are frequently discussed.
*In 401, the poet Claudian described how Raetia was troubled by the local Vindelici there while Stilicho was preoccupied in Italy with the invasion of Alaric, a Gothic military leader from inside the empire. According to Claudian, &quot;the peoples (&quot;gentes&quot;) broken their treaties (&quot;foedera&quot;, implying a pact with non-Romans) and, encouraged by the news of Latium&#x27;s trouble, had seized upon the glades of Vindelicia and the fields of Noricum&quot;. The text says that Stilicho&#x27;s victories forces were &quot;Vandal spoils&quot; (&quot;Vandalicis ... spoliis&quot;) and so many scholars believe Vandals were involved. Furthermore, there are proposals that they included the same groups who later went to Hispania, including both Silingi and Hasdingi. This would mean that Vandals had already moved and gather near the Rhine.
*In 406, the year of the Rhine crossing of the Vandals and Alans, Radagaisus, a Gothic leader from outside the empire, attacked Italy with a very large force from the Middle Danube itself. Modern scholars have proposed various connections between these events and the movement westwards of the Vandals and others.

===Kingdom of the Suevi in Gallaecia===
Many scholars believe that the Quadi listed by Jerome in 409, and perhaps most of those listed, must have previously entered Gaul in a large and coordinated crossing of the Rhine involving Vandals and Alans, which is traditionally dated to 31 December 406 AD. According to this proposal the Quadi changed their name to Suevi, never used the old name anymore, and then coordinated with the Vandals and Alans to conquer Hispania. Because of the incomplete records, scholars take different positions about the proposal that significant numbers of Quadi moved to Hispania, but Castritius, for example, believed that the &quot;majority&quot; of the Quadi became Suevi and finished up in Spain. Not all scholars agree. Others propose that the Hispania Suevi were from other Suevian groups. For example, medieval historians such as Gregory of Tours understood them to be Alemanni. Reynolds proposed that the Spanish Suevi were from present-day northern Germany, and could have come by ship. Some modern scholars propose that the Quadi among the Spanish Suevi lost their name because this was a mixed group which included Quadi along with other types of Suevi.

There is no record which specifically connects Quadi with the crossing of 406, but there are two near-contemporary records which imply that Suevi were involved. Hydatius says that in the autumn of 409 when the Alans, and the Hasdingi and Silingi Vandals, entered Hispania they were together with Suevi. Orosius specified that they fought at the same crossing when the Franks attempted to defend Gaul against the Vandals. He even believed that the Suevi, Vandals, Alans and Burgundians were all part of a heretical movement driven by the Roman military leader Stilicho, whose father was a Vandal officer in the Roman army, and who wanted to destabilize Gaul for his own benefit. (Such accusations against Stilicho are not accepted by modern scholars.) On this basis many scholars therefore suggest that the Quadi in Gaul must have changed their name to &quot;Suevi&quot;.

Arguing against the proposal that the Quadi changed name to Suevi and moved to Spain, Reynolds argued in 1957 that if the Suevi in Spain were Quadi, then it is inconceivable that they and others writing about them would give up and even forget this famous name after leaving Gaul. He also argued that Hydatius and Orosius are not reliable for the events involved. He noted for example that in disagreement with Hydatius, the &quot;Gallic Chronicle of 452&quot; registered the Suevi as arriving in Hispania already in 408, before the letter of Jerome, and before the Vandals and Alans. 

When the Vandals, Alans and Suevi arrived in Hispania, it was under the control of a rebel Roman general Gerontius who came to agreements with them as military allies in his struggle against Roman forces. The four groups proceeded to divide Hispania between themselves into four kingdoms, with the agreement of Gerontius. After the defeat of Gerontius, the Roman authorities rejected these agreements and the Visigoths began to work against the four kingdoms. After many of the Vandals and Alans moved to Carthage, the Suevi were the last of them to hold an independent kingdom, which they succeeded to hold until 585, when the kingdom was absorbed by the Visigothic kingdom.

===The Kingdom of the &quot;Danube Suevi&quot;===

By the early 5th century the Middle Danube region had come under the domination of the Huns and their allies, and Roman power was ineffective in this region. In 427 the chronicle of Marcellinus Comes says that the provinces of Pannonia, &quot;which had been held by the Huns for fifty years, were reclaimed by the Romans&quot;. However, in 433 Flavius Aëtius effectively ceded Pannonia to Attila.

Although there is no direct contemporary evidence that the Quadi continued to exist as subjects of Attila under their old name, centuries later Paulus Diaconus listed them among the subject peoples who Attila could call upon. In addition to the better-known Goths and Gepids he listed &quot;Marcomanni, Suebi, Quadi, and alongside them the Herules, Thuringi and Rugii&quot;. Taken at face value this implies that the Quadi might for example have been present at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451, fighting for Attila. However this is a much later source, and modern scholars especially doubt whether the Marcomanni or Quadi would still have been identified under those names in 451, because more contemporary sources never mention these names anymore in this period.

After the death of Attila in 453 some of the smaller peoples who had lived within under his hegemony begin to appear in more records, but instead of the Marcomanni and Quadi, only Suevians appear. After the Battle of Nedao in 454, when the sons of Attila and their Ostrogothic allies were defeated, the victors were able to consolidate independent kingdoms north of the Middle Danube. The largest and longest lasting, the Gepids, was based in Dacia. To the west, north of the Danube where the Marcomanni and Quadi had been were the Rugii, Heruli, and Sciri. And on the south of that stretch of the Danube, in what used to be the northern part of Roman Pannonia Valeria, a Suevian kingdom also existed. As in the case of the Suevi in Hispania, many scholars believe that this group included Suevian peoples such as the Quadi who had previously gone by other names. Herwig Wolfram for example:
:The Marcomanni and the Quadi gave up their special names after crossing the Danube, in fact both the emigrants and the groups remaining in Pannonia became Suebi again. The Pannonian Suebi became subjects of the Huns. After the battle at the Nadao they set up their kingdom, and when it fell, they came, successively under Herulian and Longobard rule, south of the Danube under Gothic rule, and eventually again under Longobard rule.

Writing in the 6th century, Jordanes reported a series of conflicts in the 460s between a Suevian king Hunimund and the Ostrogothic king Thiudimir, whose people had settled within the Roman empire just to the south. In 467 or 468, Hunimund led a campaign into Dalmatia. After stealing Gothic cattle, the Suevi were attacked near Lake Balaton by Thiudimir, and Hunimund was captured. He was subsequently released from Gothic captivity after he submitted and adopted as Thiudimir&#x27;s &quot;son by arms&quot; (&quot;filius per arma&quot;). However, in 468 or early 469, Hunimund plotted with the Sciri and attacked the Ostrogothic king Valamir. Valamir lost his life, but the Sciri and Suevi lost the battle, and the Sciri were almost destroyed. A little later, in 469, at the Battle of Bolia, Hunimund and Alaric, apparently both kings of the Suevi, called upon the Sarmatians, and the remnants of the Sciri, led by Edica and Hunwulf, and also the Gepids and Rugians. However, Thiudimir and his Goths defeated these allies, confirming their position as dominant power in this region (from which they would later invade Italy under Theoderic the Great). Still later during the cold winter of 469/470, Thiudimir attacked the Suevi unexpectedly by crossing the frozen Danube. The Suavi were now together in a confederation with the Alemanni, in an Alpine region with streams that flowed loudly into the Danube, Baiuvarii (early Bavarians) on the east, Franks on the west, Burgundians on the south, and Thuringians on the north. Thiudimir returned as victor to his own home in Pannonia. 

It is considered likely that Hunimund and at least some of his people escaped this defeat and that he is also the person of that name who was mentioned in the biography of Saint Severinus of Noricum, by Eugippius. This Hunimund attacked Saint Severinus&#x27;s community at Passau with &quot;barbarians&quot;. Passau was also troubled by the Alemanni. It is also likely that some of the Suevi continued to live under Gothic rule in this area. It may also be during this period that some Suevi settled south of the Drava river in a region more directly under Gothic control and known during this time as Suavia.

===Allemanni, Lombards, and Bavarians and Slavs===
The alliance of Hunimund with the Allemanni has been interpreted as evidence of a new Alemannic-Suebi ethnogenesis in the second half of the 5th century, which could explain the documented use of the Suevi name to refer to the Alemanni after about 500. 

Many of the Suevi who remained in the Pannonian region are believed to have taken up a Lombardic identity after the defeat of the Ostrogoths by the emperor Justinian, and many may therefore have subsequently entered Italy with the Lombards. The region subsequently came under the control of the Pannonian Avars, and it is probably during this period that Slavic languages eventually became dominant in the areas where the Quadi had lived.

The record which mentions the Suebi joining the Alemanni is also one of the first records mentioning the early Bavarians, or Baiuvarii, who were also living south of the Danube, to the east of the Alemanni, in what had been Roman territory. It is generally believed that their name is Germanic, and that it indicates an origin in the nearby regions to the east, which were once inhabited by the Boii. It is therefore considered very likely that the Baiuvarii included Marcomanni and Quadi.

<text>The Rugii, Rogi or Rugians (), were one of the smaller Germanic peoples of Late Antiquity who are best known for their short-lived 5th-century kingdom upon the Roman frontier, near present-day Krems an der Donau in Austria. This kingdom, like those of the neighbouring Heruli and Sciri, first appears in records after the death of Attila in 453. The Rugii, Heruli, Sciri and others are believed to have moved into this region from distant homelands under pressure from the Huns, and become part of Attila&#x27;s Hunnic empire which also moved and came to be based in this region. The Rugii were subsequently part of the alliance which defeated Attila&#x27;s sons and the Ostrogoths at the Battle of Nedao in 454, giving their kingdom independence. In 469 they were part of a similar alliance who lost to the Ostrogoths at the Battle of Bolia, weakening their kingdom significantly.

Many Rugii, once again along with Sciri, Heruli and other Danubians, joined Odoacer in Italy and became part of his kingdom there. Fearing new plots against him, he nevertheless invaded the Rugian kingdom in 487, and the Rugian lands were then settled by the Lombards from the north. Most Rugii still in the Danubian region eventually joined the Ostrogoth Theoderic the Great who killed Odoacer and replaced him with a Gothic-led regime in Italy. The Rugii were based in Pavia and played an important role in the Italian kingdom until it was destroyed by Justinian. The third last king was the Rugian Eraric who died in 541. After him the Rugians disappear from history.

It is generally accepted that the Rugii were first clearly recorded by Tacitus in the first century, in his &quot;Germania&quot;. He mentioned a people called the &quot;Rugii&quot; living near the south shore of the Baltic Sea, near the Lemovii and east of the Gutones who apparently lived near the mouth of the Vistula. The 6th century writer Procopius included them among the &quot;Gothic peoples&quot;, grouping them with Goths, Gepids, Vandals, Sciri, and the non-Germanic Alans, who were mainly associated with Eastern Europe. 

Various other records mentioning places or peoples with similar names have been associated with the Danubian Rugii as possible relatives, mainly on the basis of similar names which all appear to be related to the grain rye. In the second century by Ptolemy mentioned the &quot;Rutikleioi&quot;, and the place known as Rougion, on the southern Baltic coast. In the 6th century Jordanes listed &quot;Rugi&quot; among the tribes supposedly living in Scandinavia in his own time, near the Dani (Danes) and &quot;Suetidi&quot; (Swedes). He also listed the &quot;Rogas&quot; as an Eastern European people of the 4th century. Much later, the medieval Rygir were a tribe residing in Rogaland of southwestern Norway, around the Boknafjord. The coastal island known today as Rügen is also sometimes associated with the Rugii. The Rugii are also associated with the &quot;Ulmerugi&quot; mentioned by Jordanes. Their name probably means &quot;island Rugii&quot;, and he described them as a people who had many centuries before him lived on the Baltic coast near the Vistula, at the time when he believed the Goths arrived by boat from Scandinavia. A similar island name, &quot;Holmrygir&quot;, is known from much later medieval Norway, in the area near Rogaland.

The name of the Rugii continued to be used after the sixth century to refer to Slavic-speaking peoples near the Danube, and Rügen, and even as a Latin name for the Rus in Ukraine.

==Etymology==
The tribal name &quot;Rugii&quot; is believed to originate from the name of the cereal rye, and would thus have meant &quot;rye eaters&quot; or &quot;rye farmers&quot;. The Proto-Germanic word for rye has been reconstructed as &quot;&quot;, and versions of the word exist in both West Germanic (reconstructed as &quot;*rugi&quot;), North Germanic languages (Old Norse &quot;&quot;), but are not known from East Germanic. They are also known in the other language families of the Baltic region: Finnic (reconstructed in Proto-Finnic &quot;&quot;); Baltic; and Slavic (&quot;&quot;). Andersson has noted that this etymology limits the possible places where we might expect the Rugii to have had their original homeland. For example the cultivation rye, which was originally cultivated in the Middle East, is not known in Norway in the Roman era, implying that the later Rygir of Norway were not living in the original Rugian homeland.

Other historical terms associated with the Rugii:
*&quot;Ulmerugi&quot;, the coastal region near the Vistula which was mentioned by Jordanes, can be translated as &quot;island Rugii&quot;, containing the Proto-Germanic word reconstructed as &quot;&quot; (English &quot;&quot;, Old Norse &quot;holmr&quot;). An equivalent word in Old Norse &quot;holmrygir&quot; is found in Norway, near the tribe who were called the Rygir.
*Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Rutikleioi&quot; have been interpreted as a scribal error for &quot;Rugikleioi&quot; (in Greek). The meaning of the second part of this name form is unclear, but it has for example been interpreted as a Germanic diminutive.
*Uncertain and disputed is the association of the Rugii with the name of the isle of Rügen and the tribe of the Rugini. Though some scholars have suggested that the Rugii passed their name to the isle of Rügen in modern Northeast Germany, other scholars have presented alternative hypotheses of Rügen&#x27;s etymology associating the name to the mediaeval Rani (Rujani) tribe.
*The &quot;Rugini&quot; were only mentioned once, in a list of Germanic tribes still to be Christianised drawn up by the English monk Bede in his of the early 8th century.

==Origins==
===Scandinavia===
Jordanes makes a references to a people called the Rugii still living in Scandinavia in the sixth century, in the area near the Dani, who are normally presumed to be the Danes.

According to an old proposal, the Rugii possibly migrated from southwest Norway to Pomerania in the first century AD. Rogaland or Rygjafylke is a region (fylke) in south west Norway. Rogaland translates &quot;Land of the Rygir&quot; (Rugii), the transition of &quot;rygir&quot; to &quot;roga&quot; being sufficiently explained with the general linguistic transitions of the Norse language.

Scholars suggest a migration either of Rogaland Rugii to the southern Baltic coast, a migration the other way around, or an original homeland on the islands of Denmark in between these two regions. None of these theories is so far backed by archaeological evidence. Another theory suggests that the name of one of the two groups was adapted by the other one later without any significant migration taking place. 

Scholars such as Andersson regard it as very unlikely that the name meaning Rye eaters or Rye farmers was invented twice. In favour of a Scandinavian origin, despite doubts about the early cultivation of Rye, he cites the sixth century claim of Jordanes that Scandinavia was the &quot;womb of nations&quot;. Others such as Pohl have argued that the similarity of names has been uncritically interpreted to indicate tribal kinship or identity, feeding a debate about the location of an &quot;original homeland&quot; without any reference to historical sources. Pohl also suggests that one possibility suggested by the work of Reinhard Wenskus and the Vienna School of History is that the name of the Rugii could have been spread by small elite groups who moved around, rather than mass migration.

===Southern Baltic coast===
The Rugii were first mentioned by Tacitus in the late first century. Tacitus&#x27; description of their contemporary settlement area was at the &quot;ocean&quot;, adjacent to the Lemovii and Gutones&gt; The Gutones are generally considered to be early Goths, and also mentioned by Ptolemy, who placed them east of the Vistula. This is generally seen as the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, the later Pomerania. Tacitus distinguished the Rugii, Gutones and Lemovii from other Germanic tribes, saying they carried round shields and short swords, and obeyed kings.

In 150 AD, the geographer Ptolemy did not mention the Rugii in this region, but he did mention a place named &quot;Rhougion&quot; (also transliterated from Greek as &quot;Rougion&quot;, &quot;Rugion&quot;, Latinized &quot;Rugium&quot; or &quot;Rugia&quot;) and a tribe named the &quot;Routikleioi&quot; in roughly the same area, between the rivers Vidua and Vistula. Both these names have been associated with the Rugii.

In the sixth century, Jordanes wrote an origin story (&quot;Origo gentis&quot;) about the Goths, the &quot;Getica&quot;, which claims that the Goths and many other peoples came from Scandinavia, the &quot;womb of nations&quot;, many centuries before his time. Upon the arrival by boat of the Goths from Scandinavia, in the coastal area of &quot;Gothiscandza&quot;, the Goths expelled a people called the &quot;Ulmerugi&quot;. 

The Oxhöft culture is associated with parts of the Rugii and Lemovii. The archaeological Gustow group of Western Pomerania is also associated with the Rugii. The remains of the Rugii west of the Vidivarii, together with other Gothic, Veneti, and Gepid groups, are believed to be identical with the archaeological Dębczyn culture.

According to an old proposal, in the second century AD, eastern Germanic peoples then mainly in the area of modern Poland, began to expand their influence, pressing peoples to their south and eventually causing the Marcomannic Wars on the Roman Danubian frontier. Given the coincidence of the same name on the Baltic and Danube, the Rugii are one of the peoples thought to have been involved. While modern authors are sceptical of some elements of the old narrative, the archaeology of the Wielbark culture has given new evidence to support this idea. 

In his &quot;Getica&quot; Jordanes claimed that the fourth century Gothic king Ermanaric, who was one of the first rulers west of the Don river to confront the Huns as they entered Europe, ruled an empire stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. In a list of the peoples conquered by him the name &quot;Rogas&quot; appears.

==Danubian and Italian Rugii==

One of the first clear records of the Rugii interacting with the Roman empire is in the Laterculus Veronensis of about 314. In a list of barbarians under the emperors it lists them together with their future neighbours the Heruli, but in a part of the list between the Scottish barbarians and the tribes north of the lower Rhine. Unlike the Heruli, they do not appear in other such 4th-century lists.

The Rugii are listed as one of the northern peoples who were led by Attila over the Rhine, to invade Gaul, and eventually fight the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451. After Attila&#x27;s death in 453 the Rugii were among the Hunnic confederates who successfully rebelled against his sons, defeating them and the Ostrogoths at the Battle of Nedao in 454. Whether or not the Rugian kingdom existed before then, and in what form, is unknown. 

A group of Rugii were settled near Constantinople after Nadao, in Bizye and Lüleburgaz where they provided troops to the empire.

With Roman power now also weakened along the Danube, the majority of the Rugii became part of the independent Rugian kingdom ruled by Flaccitheus in Rugiland, a region presently part of lower Austria (ancient Noricum), north of the Danube. After Flaccitheus&#x27;s death, the Rugii of Rugiland were led by king Feletheus, also called Feva, and his wife Gisa. Yet other Rugii had already become foederati of Odoacer, who was to become the first king of Italy in 476. 
By 482 the Rugii had converted to Arianism. 

Feletheus&#x27; Rugii were utterly defeated by Odoacer in 487; many came into captivity and were carried to Italy, and subsequently, Rugiland was settled by the Lombards. Records of this era are made by Procopius, Jordanes and others.

Two years later, Rugii joined the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great when he invaded Italy in 489. Within the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy, they kept their own administrators and avoided intermarriage with the Goths. They disappeared after Totila&#x27;s defeat in the Gothic War (535–554).

==Legacy==
===Possible continuations in the north===
It is assumed that Burgundians, Goths and Gepids with parts of the Rugians left Pomerania during the late Roman Age, and that during the Migration Period, remnants of Rugians, Vistula Veneti, Vidivarii and other, Germanic tribes remained and formed units that were later Slavicized. The Vidivarii themselves are described by Jordanes in his Getica as a melting pot of tribes who in the mid-6th century lived at the lower Vistula. Though differing from the earlier Wielbark culture, some traditions were continued. One hypothesis, based on the sudden appearance of large amounts of Roman solidi and migrations of other groups after the breakdown of the Hun empire in 453, suggest a partial re-migration of earlier emigrants to their former northern homelands.

The ninth-century Old English Widsith, a compilation of earlier oral traditions, mentions the tribe of the &quot;Holmrycum&quot; without localizing it. &quot;Holmrygir&quot; are mentioned in an Old Norse Skaldic poem, &quot;Hákonarmál&quot;, and probably also in the Haraldskvæði.

James Campbell has argued that, regarding Bede&#x27;s &quot;Rugini&quot;, &quot;the sense of the Latin is that these are the peoples from whom the Anglo-Saxons living in Britain were derived&quot;. The Rugini would thus be among the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons. Whether the Rugini were remnants of the Rugii is speculative. Despite the identification by Bede as Germanic, some scholars have attempted to link the Rugini with the Rani.

===The continuation of the name===
According to Pohl, the name was taken up in a historicizing manner from the 10th century onwards to refer to Slavic peoples on the lower Austrian Danube (Pohl refers to Raffelstettener customs ordinance shortly after 900), on the Baltic Sea (citing Otto of Freising, Chronica 7, 9), or also the Rus (citing the Continuatio Reginonis a. 959-60).

<text>Louis Philippe I (6 October 1773 – 26 August 1850), nicknamed the Citizen King, was King of the French from 1830 to 1848, the penultimate monarch of France, and the last French monarch to bear the title &quot;King.&quot; He abdicated from his throne during the French Revolution of 1848, which led to the foundation of the French Second Republic. 

Louis Philippe was the eldest son of Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans (later known as Philippe Égalité). As Duke of Chartres, the younger Louis Philippe distinguished himself commanding troops during the French Revolutionary Wars and was promoted to lieutenant general by the age of 19 but broke with the First French Republic over its decision to execute King Louis XVI. He fled to Switzerland in 1793 after being connected with a plot to restore France&#x27;s monarchy. His father fell under suspicion and was executed during the Reign of Terror.

Louis Philippe remained in exile for 21 years until the Bourbon Restoration. He was proclaimed king in 1830 after his cousin Charles X was forced to abdicate by the July Revolution. The reign of Louis Philippe is known as the July Monarchy and was dominated by wealthy industrialists and bankers. During the 1840–1848 period, he followed conservative policies, especially under the influence of French statesman François Guizot. He also promoted friendship with Great Britain and sponsored colonial expansion, notably the French conquest of Algeria. His popularity faded as economic conditions in France deteriorated in 1847, and he was forced to abdicate after the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1848.

Louis Philippe lived for the remainder of his life in exile in the United Kingdom. His supporters were known as Orléanists, while the Legitimists supported the main line of the House of Bourbon, and the Bonapartists supported the Bonaparte family. Among his grandchildren were King Leopold II of Belgium, Empress Carlota of Mexico, Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, and Queen Mercedes of Spain.

==Before the Revolution (1773–1789)==
===Early life===
Louis Philippe was born in the Palais-Royal, the residence of the Orléans family in Paris, to Louis Philippe, Duke of Chartres (Duke of Orléans, upon the death of his father Louis Philippe I), and Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a Prince of the Blood, which entitled him the use of the style &quot;Serene Highness&quot;. His mother was an extremely wealthy heiress who was descended from Louis XIV through a legitimized line.

Louis Philippe was the eldest of three sons and a daughter, a family that was to have erratic fortunes from the beginning of the French Revolution to the Bourbon Restoration. The elder branch of the House of Bourbon, to which the kings of France belonged, deeply distrusted the intentions of the cadet branch, which would succeed to the throne of France should the senior branch die out. Louis Philippe&#x27;s father was exiled from the royal court, and the Orléans confined themselves to studies of the literature and sciences emerging from the Enlightenment.

===Education===
Louis Philippe was tutored by the Countess of Genlis, beginning in 1782. She instilled in him a fondness for liberal thought; it is probably during this period that Louis Philippe picked up his slightly Voltairean brand of Catholicism. When Louis Philippe&#x27;s grandfather died in 1785, his father succeeded him as Duke of Orléans and Louis Philippe succeeded his father as Duke of Chartres.

In 1788, with the French Revolution looming, the young Louis Philippe showed his liberal sympathies when he helped break down the door of a prison cell in Mont Saint-Michel, during a visit there with the Countess of Genlis. From October 1788 to October 1789, the &quot;Palais Royal&quot; was a meeting-place for the revolutionaries.

==Revolution (1789–1793)==
Louis Philippe grew up in a period that changed Europe as a whole, and following his father&#x27;s strong support for the Revolution he involved himself completely in those changes. In his diary, he reports that he took the initiative to join the Jacobin Club, a move that his father supported.

===Military service===
In June 1791, Louis Philippe got his first opportunity to become involved in the affairs of France. In 1785, he had been given the hereditary appointment of Colonel of the Chartres Dragoons (renamed 14th Dragoons in 1791). With war imminent in 1791, all proprietary colonels were ordered to join their regiments. Louis Philippe was a model officer, and demonstrated his personal bravery in two famous instances. First, three days after Louis XVI&#x27;s flight to Varennes, a quarrel between two local priests and one of the new constitutional vicars became heated. A crowd surrounded the inn where the priests were staying, demanding blood. The young colonel broke through the crowd and extricated the two priests, who fled. At a river crossing on the same day, another crowd threatened to harm the priests. Louis Philippe put himself between a peasant armed with a carbine and the priests, saving their lives. The next day, Louis Philippe dived into a river to save a drowning local engineer. For this action, he received a civic crown from the local municipality. His regiment was moved north to Flanders at the end of 1791 after the 27 August 1791 Declaration of Pillnitz.

Louis Philippe served under his father&#x27;s crony, Armand Louis de Gontaut the Duke of Biron, along with several officers who later gained distinction. These included Colonel Louis Alexandre Berthier and Lieutenant Colonel Alexandre de Beauharnais (husband of the future Empress Joséphine). After the Kingdom of France declared war on the Habsburg monarchy on 20 April 1792, Louis Philippe first participated in what became known as the French Revolutionary Wars within the French-occupied Austrian Netherlands at Boussu on about 28 April 1792. He was next engaged at Quaregnon on about 29 April 1792, and then at Quiévrain near Jemappes on about 30 April 1792. There he was instrumental in rallying a unit of retreating soldiers after French forces had been victorious at the Battle of Quiévrain (1792) two days earlier on 28 April 1792. The Duke of Biron wrote to War Minister Pierre Marie de Grave, praising the young colonel, who was promoted to brigadier general; he commanded the 4th Brigade of cavalry in Nicolas Luckner&#x27;s Army of the North.

In the Army of the North, Louis Philippe served with four future Marshals of France: Étienne-Jacques-Joseph-Alexandre MacDonald, Édouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier (who would later be killed in an assassination attempt on Louis Philippe), Louis-Nicolas Davout and Nicolas Oudinot. Charles François Dumouriez was appointed to command the Army of the North in August 1792. Louis Philippe continued to command his brigade under him in the Valmy campaign. At the 20 September 1792 Battle of Valmy, Louis Philippe was ordered to place a battery of artillery on the crest of the hill of Valmy. The battle was apparently inconclusive, but the Austrian-Prussian army, short of supplies, was forced back across the Rhine. Dumouriez praised Louis Philippe&#x27;s performance in a letter after the battle. Louis Philippe was recalled to Paris to give an account of the Battle at Valmy to the French government. He had a rather trying interview with Georges Danton, the Minister of Justice, which he later told his children about. Shortly thereafter, he was made Governor of Strasbourg.

While in Paris, Louis Philippe was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. In October Louis Philippe returned to the Army of the North, where Dumouriez had begun a march into the Austrian Netherlands (now Belgium). Louis Philippe again commanded a brigade, even though he held the rank of lieutenant general. On 6 November 1792, Dumouriez chose to attack an Austrian force in a strong position on the heights of Cuesmes and Jemappes to the west of Mons. Louis Philippe&#x27;s division sustained heavy casualties as it attacked through a wood, and retreated in disorder. Lt. General Louis Philippe rallied a group of units, dubbing them &quot;the battalion of Mons&quot;, and pushed forward along with other French units, finally overwhelming the outnumbered Austrians.

Events in Paris undermined Louis Philippe&#x27;s budding military career. The incompetence of Jean-Nicolas Pache, the new Girondist appointee of 3 October 1792, left the Army of the North almost without supplies. Soon thousands of troops were deserting the army. Louis Philippe was alienated by the more radical policies of the Republic. After the National Convention decided to put the deposed king to death, Louis Philippe began to consider leaving France. He was dismayed that his own father, known then as &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot;, voted in favour of the execution. Louis Philippe was willing to stay to fulfill his duties in the army, but he became implicated in the plot Dumouriez had planned to ally with the Austrians, march his army on Paris, and restore the Constitution of 1791. Dumouriez had met with Louis Philippe on 22 March 1793 and urged his subordinate to join in the attempt.

With the French government falling into the Reign of Terror about the time of the creation of the Revolutionary Tribunal earlier in March 1793, Louis Philippe decided to leave France to save his life. On 4 April, Dumouriez and Louis Philippe left for the Austrian camp. They were intercepted by Lieutenant-Colonel Louis-Nicolas Davout, who had served at the Battle of Jemappes with Louis Philippe. As Dumouriez ordered the Colonel back to the camp, some of his soldiers cried out against the General, now declared a traitor by the National Convention. Shots rang out as the two men fled toward the Austrian camp. The next day, Dumouriez again tried to rally soldiers against the convention; however, he found that the artillery had declared itself in favour of the Republic. He and Louis Philippe had no choice but to go into exile when Philippe Égalité was arrested. At the age of 19, and already ranked as a Lieutenant General, Louis Philippe left France. He did not return for 21 years.

==Exile (1793–1815)==
The reaction in Paris to Louis Philippe&#x27;s involvement in Dumouriez&#x27;s treason inevitably resulted in misfortunes for the Orléans family. Philippe Égalité spoke in the National Convention, condemning his son for his actions, asserting that he would not spare his son, much akin to the Roman consul Brutus and his sons. However, letters from Louis Philippe to his father were discovered in transit and were read out to the Convention. Philippe Égalité was then put under continuous surveillance. Shortly thereafter, the Girondists moved to arrest him and the two younger brothers of Louis Philippe, Louis-Charles and Antoine Philippe; the latter had been serving in the Army of Italy. The three were interned in Fort Saint-Jean (Marseille).

Meanwhile, Louis Philippe was forced to live in the shadows, avoiding both pro-Republican revolutionaries and Legitimist French &quot;émigré&quot; centres in various parts of Europe and also in the Austrian army. He first moved to Switzerland under an assumed name, and met up with the Countess of Genlis and his sister Adélaïde at Schaffhausen. From there they went to Zürich, where the Swiss authorities decreed that to protect Swiss neutrality, Louis Philippe would have to leave the city. They went to Zug, where Louis Philippe was discovered by a group of &quot;émigrés&quot;.

It became quite apparent that for the women to settle peacefully anywhere, they would have to separate from Louis Philippe. He then left with his faithful valet Baudouin for the heights of the Alps, and then to Basel, where he sold all but one of his horses. Now moving from town to town throughout Switzerland, he and Baudouin found themselves very much exposed to all the distresses of extended travelling. They were refused entry to a monastery by monks who believed them to be young vagabonds. Another time, he woke up after spending a night in a barn to find himself at the far end of a musket, confronted by a man attempting to keep away thieves.

Throughout this period, Louis Philippe never stayed in one place more than 48 hours. Finally, in October 1793, Louis Philippe was appointed a teacher of geography, history, mathematics and modern languages, at a boys&#x27; boarding school. The school, owned by a Monsieur Jost, was in Reichenau, a village on the upper Rhine in the then independent Grisons league state, now part of Switzerland. His salary was 1,400 francs and he taught under the name &quot;Monsieur Chabos&quot;. He had been at the school for a month when he heard the news from Paris: his father had been guillotined on 6 November 1793 after a trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal.

===Travel===
After Louis Philippe left Reichenau, he separated the now 16-year-old Adélaïde from the Countess of Genlis, who had fallen out with Louis Philippe. Adélaïde went to live with her great-aunt the Princess of Conti at Fribourg, then to Bavaria and Hungary and, finally, to her mother, who was exiled in Spain. Louis Philippe travelled extensively. He visited Scandinavia in 1795 and then moved on to Finland. For about a year he stayed in Muonio, a remote village in the valley of the Tornio river in Lapland. He lived in the rectory under the name Müller, as a guest of the local Lutheran vicar. While visiting Muonio, he supposedly fathered a child with Beata Caisa Wahlborn (1766–1830) called Erik Kolstrøm (1796–1879).
Louis Philippe visited the United States ( to 1798), staying in Philadelphia (where his brothers Antoine and Louis Charles were in exile), New York City (where he most likely stayed at the Somerindyck family estate on Broadway and 75th Street with other exiled princes), and Boston. In Boston, he taught French for a time and lived in lodgings over what is now the Union Oyster House, Boston&#x27;s oldest restaurant. During his time in the United States, Louis Philippe met with American politicians and people of high society, including George Clinton, John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and George Washington.

Louis Philippe&#x27;s visit to Cape Cod in 1797 coincided with the division of the town of Eastham into two towns, one of which took the name of Orleans, possibly in his honour. During their sojourn, the Orléans princes travelled throughout the country, as far south as Nashville and as far north as Maine. The brothers were even held in Philadelphia briefly during an outbreak of yellow fever. Louis Philippe is also thought to have met Isaac Snow of Orleans, Massachusetts, who had escaped to France from a British prison hulk during the American Revolutionary War. In 1839, while reflecting on his visit to the United States, Louis Philippe explained in a letter to François Guizot that his three years there had a large influence on his political beliefs and judgments when he became king.

In Boston, Louis Philippe learned of the coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797) and of the exile of his mother to Spain. He and his brothers then decided to return to Europe. They went to New Orleans, planning to sail to Havana and thence to Spain. This, however, was a troubled journey, as Spain and Great Britain were then at war. While in colonial Louisiana in 1798, they were entertained by Julien Poydras in the town of Pointe Coupée, as well as by the Marigny de Mandeville family in New Orleans.

The three brothers sailed for Havana in an American corvette, but a British warship intercepted their ship in the Gulf of Mexico. The British seized the brothers, but took them to Havana anyway. Unable to find passage to Europe, the brothers spent a year in Cuba (from spring 1798 to autumn 1799), until they were unexpectedly expelled by the Spanish authorities. They sailed via the Bahamas to Nova Scotia, where they were received by the Duke of Kent, son of King George III and (later) father of Queen Victoria. Louis Philippe struck up a lasting friendship with the British prince. Eventually, the brothers sailed back to New York, and in January 1800, they arrived in England, where they stayed for the next fifteen years. During these years, Louis Philippe taught mathematics and geography at the now-defunct Great Ealing School, reckoned, in its 19th-century heyday, to be &quot;the best private school in England&quot;.

=== In British service ===
Louis Philippe and his brothers were not officially received as royals at the British court, but they were able to blend in socially with the English aristocracy, and by November 1801 Louis Philippe admitted to his brothers that he was &quot;putting down roots in the country&quot;. By October 1803, his new loyalties led to a clash with Charles Philippe, Count of Artois (the future king Charles X), when he wore the Hanoverian black cockade in place of the French white cockade on inspecting French royalist volunteer troops in London. In July 1804, he wrote to the Bishop of Llandaff that global security and the future of humankind depended on England&#x27;s resistance to Napoleon. In the summer of 1807, he moved his residence from Twickenham to the Duke of Kent&#x27;s Castle Hill Lodge.

In 1808, Louis Philippe proposed to Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King George III. His Catholicism and the opposition of her mother, Queen Charlotte, meant the Princess reluctantly declined the offer.

On 15 April 1808, Louis Philippe departed from Portsmouth for Palermo in the then British protectorate of Sicily via Gibraltar, Cagliari, Valletta (where his sole surviving brother, Louis Charles, died) and Messina, arriving on 20 June. He remained in Sicily in the pay of the British Foreign Office until the Bourbon First Restoration in 1814; he was last remunerated at the discretion of Lord A&#x27;Court, the British representative in Palermo, after July 1814. In his role as a British agent, he initially prepared for a mission in Mexico, where he was to act as the military adviser to Leopold, Prince of Salerno in inciting an anti-French rebellion with British naval support. After the news of the outbreak of the Peninsular War reached Sicily in July 1808, he sailed for Gibraltar of his own initiative with the prince, but was directed to London and prohibited entry into Spain on pain of losing his allowance. He passed the winter in Malta and returned to Sicily in March 1809 upon receiving British authorisation for a military campaign in Italy against Joachim Murat, but instead he spent two months in Cagliari (from April to June 1809) trying to persuade Victor Emmanuel I to launch an attack against Napoleon in the Po Valley. During this time, he finally gave up on marrying Princess Elizabeth and unsuccessfully lobbied the Bourbons of Sicily to obtain the Ionian Islands as a principality for himself.

On 25 November 1809, Louis Philippe married Princess Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, daughter of King Ferdinand IV of Naples and Maria Carolina of Austria, in Palermo. The marriage was controversial because her mother&#x27;s younger sister was Queen Marie Antoinette, and Louis Philippe&#x27;s father was considered to have a role in Marie Antoinette&#x27;s execution. The Queen of Naples was opposed to the match for this reason. She had been very close to her sister and devastated by her execution, but she had given her consent after Louis Philippe had convinced her that he was determined to compensate for the mistakes of his father, and after having agreed to answer all her questions regarding his father.

==Bourbon Restoration (1815–1830)==
After the abdication of Napoleon, Louis Philippe, known as &quot;Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans&quot;, returned to France during the reign of his cousin Louis XVIII, at the time of the Bourbon Restoration. Louis Philippe had reconciled the Orléans family with Louis XVIII in exile, and was once more to be found in the elaborate royal court. However, his resentment at the treatment of his family, the cadet branch of the House of Bourbon under the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, caused friction between him and Louis XVIII, and he openly sided with the liberal opposition.

Upon his return to Paris in May 1814, the Duke of Orléans was restored to the rank of lieutenant-general in the army by Louis XVIII. He was denied the title of &quot;Altesse Royale&quot; (Royal Highness), although it was accorded to his wife. Louis Philippe had to settle for the lesser &quot;Altesse Serenissime&quot; (Serene Highness). Less than a year after returning to France, he and his family were uprooted by the return of Napoléon from Elba, known as the Hundred Days. On 6 March 1815, after the news of Napoléon&#x27;s return to France reached Paris, Louis Philippe was dispatched to Lyon with the Comte d&#x27;Artois (the future Charles X) to organize a defense against the Emperor, but the hopelessness of the situation soon became apparent and he was back in the capital by the 12th. Thereafter, Louis XVIII made him commander of the Army of the North. In the days after Napoléon entered Paris (March 20), Louis XVIII fled to Belgium and Louis Philippe resigned his commission, choosing to join his family in exile in England. This brought him further scorn from royalists because he did not join Louis XVIII in Belgium. Napoléon was soon defeated in the Battle of Waterloo and Louis XVIII was restored to power, but Louis Philippe and his family only returned to France in 1817, after the wave of repression and recriminations had faded.

Louis Philippe was on far friendlier terms with Louis XVIII&#x27;s brother and successor, Charles X, who acceded to the throne in 1824, and with whom he socialized. Charles X granted him the &quot;Altesse Royale&quot; title, and permitted Louis Henri, Prince of Condé to make Louis Philippe&#x27;s fourth son, Henri d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Aumale, heir to the domaine of Chantilly. However, Louis Philippe&#x27;s opposition to the policies of Joseph de Villèle and later of Jules de Polignac caused him to be viewed as a constant threat to the stability of Charles&#x27; government. This soon proved to be to his advantage.

==King of the French (1830–1848)==

In 1830, the July Revolution overthrew Charles X, who abdicated in favour of his 10-year-old grandson, Henri, Duke of Bordeaux. Charles X named Louis Philippe &quot;Lieutenant général du royaume&quot;, and charged him to announce his desire to have his grandson succeed him to the popularly elected Chamber of Deputies. Louis Philippe did not do this, in order to increase his own chances of succession. As a consequence, because the chamber was aware of his liberal policies and of his popularity with the masses, they proclaimed Louis Philippe as the new French king, displacing the senior branch of the House of Bourbon. For the prior eleven days Louis Philippe had been acting as the regent for the young Henri.

Charles X and his family, including his grandson, went into exile in the United Kingdom. The young ex-king, the Duke of Bordeaux, in exile took the title of &quot;Comte de Chambord&quot;. Later he became the pretender to the throne of France and was supported by the Legitimists. Louis Philippe was sworn in as King Louis Philippe I on 9 August 1830. Upon his accession to the throne, Louis Philippe assumed the title of &quot;King of the French&quot;, a title previously adopted by Louis XVI in the short-lived Constitution of 1791. Linking the monarchy to a people instead of a territory (as the previous designation &quot;King of France and of Navarre&quot;) was aimed at undercutting the Legitimist claims of Charles X and his family.

By an ordinance he signed on 13 August 1830, the new king defined the manner in which his children, as well as his &quot;beloved&quot; sister, would continue to bear the surname &quot;d&#x27;Orléans&quot; and the arms of Orléans, declared that his eldest son, as &quot;Prince Royal&quot; (not &quot;Dauphin&quot;), would bear the title &quot;Duke of Orléans&quot;, that the younger sons would continue to have their previous titles, and that his sister and daughters would be styled &quot;Princesses of Orléans&quot;, not &quot;of France&quot;. His ascent to the title of King of the French was seen as a betrayal by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. Nicholas ended their friendship. In 1832, Louis&#x27; daughter, Princess Louise-Marie, married the first ruler of Belgium, King Leopold I. Their descendants include all subsequent Kings of the Belgians, and Empress Carlota of Mexico.

==Rule==


Louis Philippe ruled in an unpretentious fashion, avoiding the pomp and lavish spending of his predecessors. Despite this outward appearance of simplicity, his support came from the wealthy &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;. At first, he was much loved and called the &quot;Citizen King&quot; and the &quot;bourgeois monarch&quot;, but his popularity suffered as his government was perceived as increasingly conservative and monarchical. Because he owed his elevation to a revolution in Paris and a faction of liberal deputies in the parliament of Charles X, Louis Philippe&#x27;s rule &quot;lacked...the mystical appeal of its Divine Right predecessor. Support for it was to a much greater degree conditional.&quot; Unlike his predecessor, he did not have a dynastic legacy to draw on, so he turned to the glories of Napoleon I to prop up his own regime. He supported the return of Napoleon&#x27;s remains to France and his son, the Duke of Joinville, brought the remains from Saint Helena for reinterment at Les Invalides. The statue of Napoleon was returned to its spot atop the Vendôme Column in 1833, and the Arc de Triomphe, a monument to Napoleon&#x27;s victories, was inaugurated in 1836. Louis Philippe also commissioned the creation of a national history museum at the Palace of Versailles, where famous Napoleonic battles were painted by important artists.

In parliament, the narrow, property-qualified electorate of the time (only about 1 in every 170 citizens was enfranchised at the beginning of the reign) provided Louis Philippe with consistent support. Under his management, the conditions of the working classes deteriorated, and the income gap widened considerably. According to William Fortescue, &quot;Louis Philippe owed his throne to a popular revolution in Paris, he was the &#x27;King of the Barricades&#x27;, yet he went on to preside over a regime which rapidly gained notoriety for political repression of the left, class oppression of the poor and rule in the interests of the rich.&quot; In foreign affairs, it was a quiet period, with friendship with Great Britain. In October 1844 he paid a visit to Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. This made him the first reigning French king to set foot on English soil since Jean II was imprisoned there after the Battle of Poitiers in 1356.

Throughout his reign, Louis Philippe faced domestic opposition from various factions, ranging from Legitimists, who supported the senior branch of the Bourbons over the Orléans branch, to Republicans. This opposition, however, was weak and fragmented. In the spring of 1832, a terrible outbreak of cholera in Paris fueled resentment against the July Monarchy and reignited revolutionary fervor. Many Parisians blamed Louis Philippe and his government for their perceived inaction in the face of the epidemic. This resentment culminated in the short-lived Republican uprising called the June Rebellion, in which insurrectionists took over a portion of central Paris. The rebellion was quickly crushed by a huge force of soldiers and National Guards who descended on the city. Louis Philippe showed a cool resolve throughout the crisis, coming to Paris as soon as he was informed of the disturbances, greeting the troops, and going amongst the people.

An industrial and agricultural depression in 1846 led to the 1848 Revolutions, and Louis Philippe&#x27;s abdication. The dissonance between his positive early reputation and his late unpopularity was epitomized by Victor Hugo in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; as an oxymoron describing his reign as &quot;Prince Equality&quot;, in which Hugo states:

==Assassination attempts==
Louis Philippe survived seven assassination attempts. On 28 July 1835, Louis Philippe survived an assassination attempt by Giuseppe Mario Fieschi and two other conspirators in Paris. During the king&#x27;s annual review of the Paris National Guard commemorating the revolution, Louis Philippe was passing along the Boulevard du Temple, which connected Place de la République to the Bastille, accompanied by three of his sons, Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans, Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours, and François d&#x27;Orléans, Prince of Joinville, and numerous staff.

Fieschi, a Corsican ex-soldier, attacked the procession with a weapon he built himself, a volley gun that later became known as the &quot;Machine infernale&quot;. This consisted of 25 gun barrels fastened to a wooden frame that could be fired simultaneously. The device was fired from the third level of n° 50 Boulevard du Temple (a commemorative plaque has since been engraved there), which had been rented by Fieschi. A ball only grazed the King&#x27;s forehead. Eighteen people were killed, including Lieutenant Colonel of the 8th Legion together with eight other officers, Marshal Mortier, duc de Trévise, and Colonel Raffet, General Girard, Captain Villate, General La Chasse de Vérigny, a woman, a 14-year-old girl and two men. A further 22 people were injured. The King and the princes escaped essentially unharmed. Horace Vernet, the King&#x27;s painter, was ordered to make a drawing of the event.

Several of the gun barrels of Fieschi&#x27;s weapon burst when it was fired; he was badly injured and was quickly captured. He was executed by guillotine together with his two co-conspirators the following year.

==Abdication and death (1848–1850)==

On 24 February 1848, during the February 1848 Revolution, King Louis Philippe abdicated in favour of his nine-year-old grandson, Philippe, comte de Paris. Fearful of what had happened to the deposed Louis XVI, Louis Philippe quickly left Paris under disguise. He rode in an ordinary cab under the name of &quot;Mr. Smith&quot;. He fled to England with his wife on board a packet boat offered to him by the British consul at Le Havre.

The National Assembly of France initially planned to accept young Philippe as king, but the strong current of public opinion rejected that. On 26 February, the Second Republic was proclaimed. Louis Napoléon Bonaparte was elected president on 10 December 1848; on 2 December 1851, he declared himself president for life and then Emperor Napoleon III in 1852.

Louis Philippe and his family remained in exile in Great Britain in Claremont, Surrey, though a plaque on Angel Hill, Bury St Edmunds, claims that he spent some time there, possibly due to a friendship with the Marquess of Bristol, who lived nearby at Ickworth House. The royal couple spent some time by the sea at St. Leonards and later at the Marquess&#x27;s home in Brighton. Louis Philippe died at Claremont on 26 August 1850. He was first buried at St. Charles Borromeo Chapel in Weybridge, Surrey. In 1876, his remains and those of his wife were taken to France and buried at the &quot;Chapelle royale de Dreux&quot;, the Orléans family necropolis his mother had built in 1816, and which he had enlarged and embellished after her death.

Port Louis Philippe (Akaroa), the oldest French colony in the South Pacific and the oldest town in the Canterbury Region of the New Zealand&#x27;s South Island was named in honour of Louis Philippe who reigned as King of the French at the time the colony was established on 18 August 1840. Louis Philippe had been instrumental in supporting the settlement project. The company responsible for the endeavour received Louis Philippe&#x27;s signature on 11 December 1839 as well as his permission to carry out the voyage in line with his policy of supporting colonial expansion and the construction of a second empire which had first commenced under him in Algeria around a decade earlier. The British Lieutenant-Governor Captain William Hobson subsequently went on to claim sovereignty over Port Louis Philippe.

As a further honorific gesture to Louis Philippe and his Orléanist branch of the Bourbons, the ship on which the settlers sailed to found the eponymous colony of Port Louis Philippe was named the &quot;Comte de Paris&quot; after Louis Philippe&#x27;s beloved infant grandson, Prince Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Count of Paris who was born on 24 August 1838.

<text>Oulunkylä (, also known as &quot;Ogeli&quot;) is a suburb and a neighbourhood of Helsinki, the capital of Finland. It is located north from the center of the city.

It has been inhabited since the 13th century. Earlier an independent municipality, it was made part of Helsinki in 1946.

Oulunkylä is also the name of a district. It consists of Patola, Veräjämäki and Veräjälaakso, and has a total area of 4.51 km2.

==History==

For centuries, Oulunkylä was part of &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; (now Vantaa). The neighbourhood started to grow after a railway station was founded there in 1881 along the Finland&#x27;s first railway line between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna. In the late 19th century and early 20th century Oulunkylä was known for many villas that were built there. In 1921 it was separated from &quot;Helsingin pitäjä&quot; and became an independent municipality. However, most of the Oulunkylä area was already owned by the City of Helsinki and in 1946 Oulunkylä, along with many other suburbs, was annexed by Helsinki.

The modern Oulunkylä is largely constructed according to the zoning scheme of 1953 that transformed the neighbourhood from a villa community into an apartment building suburb.

<text>Shellsort, also known as Shell sort or Shell&#x27;s method, is an in-place comparison sort. It can be understood as either a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) or sorting by insertion (insertion sort). The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. By starting with far-apart elements, it can move some out-of-place elements into the position faster than a simple nearest-neighbor exchange. Donald Shell published the first version of this sort in 1959. The running time of Shellsort is heavily dependent on the gap sequence it uses. For many practical variants, determining their time complexity remains an open problem.

== Description ==
Shellsort is an optimization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The idea is to arrange the list of elements so that, starting anywhere, taking every &quot;h&quot;th element produces a sorted list. Such a list is said to be &quot;h&quot;-sorted. It can also be thought of as &quot;h&quot; interleaved lists, each individually sorted. Beginning with large values of &quot;h&quot; allows elements to move long distances in the original list, reducing large amounts of disorder quickly, and leaving less work for smaller &quot;h&quot;-sort steps to do. If the list is then &quot;k-sorted&quot; for some smaller integer &quot;k&quot;, then the list remains &quot;h&quot;-sorted. A final sort with &quot;h&quot; = 1 ensures the list is fully sorted at the end, but a judiciously chosen decreasing sequence of &quot;h&quot; values leaves very little work for this final pass to do.

In simplistic terms, this means if we have an array of 1024 numbers, our first gap (&quot;h&quot;) could be 512. We then run through the list comparing each element in the first half to the element in the second half. Our second gap (&quot;k&quot;) is 256, which breaks the array into four sections (starting at 0, 256, 512, 768), and we make sure the first items in each section are sorted relative to each other, then the second item in each section, and so on. In practice the gap sequence could be anything, but the last gap is always 1 to finish the sort (effectively finishing with an ordinary insertion sort).

An example run of Shellsort with gaps 5, 3 and 1 is shown below.

The first pass, 5-sorting, performs insertion sort on five separate subarrays (&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;6, &quot;a&quot;11), (&quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;7, &quot;a&quot;12), (&quot;a&quot;3, &quot;a&quot;8), (&quot;a&quot;4, &quot;a&quot;9), (&quot;a&quot;5, &quot;a&quot;10). For instance, it changes the subarray (&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;6, &quot;a&quot;11) from (62, 17, 25) to (17, 25, 62). The next pass, 3-sorting, performs insertion sort on the three subarrays (&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;4, &quot;a&quot;7, &quot;a&quot;10), (&quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;5, &quot;a&quot;8, &quot;a&quot;11), (&quot;a&quot;3, &quot;a&quot;6, &quot;a&quot;9, &quot;a&quot;12). The last pass, 1-sorting, is an ordinary insertion sort of the entire array (&quot;a&quot;1..., &quot;a&quot;12).

As the example illustrates, the subarrays that Shellsort operates on are initially short; later they are longer but almost ordered. In both cases insertion sort works efficiently.

Unlike insertion sort, Shellsort is not a stable sort since gapped insertions transport equal elements past one another and thus lose their original order. It is an adaptive sorting algorithm in that it executes faster when the input is partially sorted.

== Pseudocode ==
Using Marcin Ciura&#x27;s gap sequence, with an inner insertion sort.

# Sort an array a[0...n-1].
gaps = [701, 301, 132, 57, 23, 10, 4, 1] # Ciura gap sequence

# Start with the largest gap and work down to a gap of 1
# similar to insertion sort but instead of 1, gap is being used in each step
foreach (gap in gaps)
 # Do a gapped insertion sort for every element in gaps
 # Each loop leaves a[0..gap-1] in gapped order
 for (i = gap; i &lt; n; i += 1)
 # save a[i] in temp and make a hole at position i
 temp = a[i]
 # shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for a[i] is found
 for (j = i; (j &gt;= gap) &amp;&amp; (a[j - gap] &gt; temp); j -= gap)
 a[j] = a[j - gap]
 # put temp (the original a[i]) in its correct location
 a[j] = temp
}
== Gap sequences ==
The question of deciding which gap sequence to use is difficult. Every gap sequence that contains 1 yields a correct sort (as this makes the final pass an ordinary insertion sort); however, the properties of thus obtained versions of Shellsort may be very different. Too few gaps slows down the passes, and too many gaps produces an overhead.

The table below compares most proposed gap sequences published so far. Some of them have decreasing elements that depend on the size of the sorted array (&quot;N&quot;). Others are increasing infinite sequences, whose elements less than &quot;N&quot; should be used in reverse order.
When the binary representation of &quot;N&quot; contains many consecutive zeroes, Shellsort using Shell&#x27;s original gap sequence makes Θ(&quot;N&quot;2) comparisons in the worst case. For instance, this case occurs for &quot;N&quot; equal to a power of two when elements greater and smaller than the median occupy odd and even positions respectively, since they are compared only in the last pass.

Although it has higher complexity than the &quot;O&quot;(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) that is optimal for comparison sorts, Pratt&#x27;s version lends itself to sorting networks and has the same asymptotic gate complexity as Batcher&#x27;s bitonic sorter.

Gonnet and Baeza-Yates observed that Shellsort makes the fewest comparisons on average when the ratios of successive gaps are roughly equal to 2.2. This is why their sequence with ratio 2.2 and Tokuda&#x27;s sequence with ratio 2.25 prove efficient. However, it is not known why this is so. Sedgewick recommends using gaps which have low greatest common divisors or are pairwise coprime. Gaps which are odd numbers seem to work well in practice: 25% reductions have been observed by avoiding even-numbered gaps. Gaps which avoid multiples of 3 and 5 seem to produce small benefits of &lt; 10%.

With respect to the average number of comparisons, Ciura&#x27;s sequence has the best known performance; gaps greater than 701 were not determined but the sequence can be further extended according to the recursive formula formula_1.

Tokuda&#x27;s sequence, defined by the simple formula formula_2, where formula_3, formula_4, can be recommended for practical applications.

If the maximum input size is small, as may occur if Shellsort is used on small subarrays by another recursive sorting algorithm such as quicksort or merge sort, then it is possible to tabulate an optimal sequence for each input size.

== Computational complexity ==
The following property holds: after &quot;h&quot;2-sorting of any &quot;h&quot;1-sorted array, the array remains &quot;h&quot;1-sorted. Every &quot;h&quot;1-sorted and &quot;h&quot;2-sorted array is also (&quot;a&quot;1&quot;h&quot;1+&quot;a&quot;2&quot;h&quot;2)-sorted, for any nonnegative integers &quot;a&quot;1 and &quot;a&quot;2. The worst-case complexity of Shellsort is therefore connected with the Frobenius problem: for given integers &quot;h&quot;1..., &quot;hn&quot; with gcd = 1, the Frobenius number &quot;g&quot;(&quot;h&quot;1..., &quot;hn&quot;) is the greatest integer that cannot be represented as &quot;a&quot;1&quot;h&quot;1+ ... +&quot;anhn&quot; with nonnegative integer &quot;a&quot;1..., &quot;an&quot;. Using known formulae for Frobenius numbers, we can determine the worst-case complexity of Shellsort for several classes of gap sequences. Proven results are shown in the above table.

Mark Allen Weiss proved that Shellsort runs in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) time when the input array is in reverse order.

With respect to the average number of operations, none of the proven results concerns a practical gap sequence. For gaps that are powers of two, Espelid computed this average as formula_5. Knuth determined the average complexity of sorting an &quot;N&quot;-element array with two gaps (&quot;h&quot;, 1) to be formula_6. It follows that a two-pass Shellsort with &quot;h&quot; = Θ(&quot;N&quot;1/3) makes on average &quot;O&quot;(&quot;N&quot;5/3) comparisons/inversions/running time. Yao found the average complexity of a three-pass Shellsort. His result was refined by Janson and Knuth: the average number of comparisons/inversions/running time made during a Shellsort with three gaps (&quot;ch&quot;, &quot;cg&quot;, 1), where &quot;h&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are coprime, is formula_7 in the first pass, formula_8 in the second pass and formula_9 in the third pass. &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;h&quot;, &quot;g&quot;) in the last formula is a complicated function asymptotically equal to formula_10. In particular, when &quot;h&quot; = Θ(&quot;N&quot;7/15) and &quot;g&quot; = Θ(&quot;N&quot;1/5), the average time of sorting is &quot;O&quot;(&quot;N&quot;23/15).

Based on experiments, it is conjectured that Shellsort with Hibbard&#x27;s gap sequence runs in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;N&quot;5/4) average time, and that Gonnet and Baeza-Yates&#x27;s sequence requires on average 0.41&quot;N&quot; ln &quot;N&quot; (ln ln &quot;N&quot; + 1/6) element moves. Approximations of the average number of operations formerly put forward for other sequences fail when sorted arrays contain millions of elements.

The graph below shows the average number of element comparisons use by various gap sequences, divided by the theoretical lower bound, i.e. log2&quot;N&quot;!. Ciuria&#x27;s sequence 1, 4, 10, 23, 57, 132, 301, 701 (labelled Ci01) has been extended according to the formula formula_11.

Applying the theory of Kolmogorov complexity, Jiang, Li, and Vitányi 
 proved the following lower bound for the order of the average number of operations/running time in a &quot;p&quot;-pass Shellsort: Ω(&quot;pN&quot;1+1/&quot;p&quot;) when &quot;p&quot; ≤ log2&quot;N&quot; and Ω(&quot;pN&quot;) when &quot;p&quot; &gt; log2&quot;N&quot;.
Therefore, Shellsort has prospects of running in an average time that asymptotically grows like &quot;N&quot; log&quot;N&quot; only when using gap sequences whose number of gaps grows in proportion to the logarithm of the array size. It is, however, unknown whether Shellsort can reach this asymptotic order of average-case complexity, which is optimal for comparison sorts. The lower bound was improved by Vitányi for every number of passes formula_12 to 
formula_13
where formula_14. This result implies for example the Jiang-Li-Vitányi lower bound for all formula_12-pass increment sequences and improves that lower bound for particular increment sequences. In fact all bounds (lower and upper) currently known for the average case are precisely matched by this lower bound. For example, this gives the new result that the Janson-Knuth upper bound is matched by the resulting lower bound for the used increment sequence, showing that three pass Shellsort for this increment sequence uses formula_16 comparisons/inversions/running time.
The formula allows us to search for increment sequences that yield lower bounds which are unknown; for example an increment sequence for four passes which has a lower bound greater than
formula_17 for the increment sequence
formula_18 formula_19 formula_20 formula_21. The lower bound becomes
formula_22

The worst-case complexity of any version of Shellsort is of higher order: Plaxton, Poonen, and Suel showed that it grows at least as rapidly as formula_23.
Robert Cypher proved a stronger lower bound: formula_24 when formula_25 for all formula_26.

== Applications ==
Shellsort performs more operations and has higher cache miss ratio than quicksort. However, since it can be implemented using little code and does not use the call stack, some implementations of the qsort function in the C standard library targeted at embedded systems use it instead of quicksort. Shellsort is, for example, used in the uClibc library. For similar reasons, in the past, Shellsort was used in the Linux kernel.

Shellsort can also serve as a sub-algorithm of introspective sort, to sort short subarrays and to prevent a slowdown when the recursion depth exceeds a given limit. This principle is employed, for instance, in the bzip2 compressor.

<doc id="77357" wikidata="Q43082" url="?curid=77357" title="Charles II of Navarre">
<text>Charles II (10 October 1332 – 1 January 1387), known as the Bad, was King of Navarre beginning in 1349, as well as Count of Évreux beginning in 1343, holding both titles until his death in 1387.

Besides the Kingdom of Navarre nestled in the Pyrenees, Charles had extensive lands in Normandy, inherited from his father, Count Philip of Évreux, and his mother, Queen Joan II of Navarre, who had received them as compensation for resigning her claims to France, Champagne, and Brie in 1328. Thus, in Northern France, he possessed Évreux, Mortain, parts of Vexin, and a portion of Cotentin. Charles was a major player at a critical juncture in the Hundred Years&#x27; War between France and England, repeatedly switching sides in order to further his own agenda. He was accidentally burned alive in 1387.

==Life==
===Early life===
Charles was born in Évreux, the son of Philip of Évreux and Joan II of Navarre. His father was first cousin to King Philip VI of France, while his mother, Joan, was the only daughter of Louis X of France. Charles of Navarre was &#x27;born of the &quot;fleur-de-lys&quot; on both sides&#x27;, as he liked to point out, but he succeeded to a shrunken inheritance as far as his French lands were concerned. Charles was raised in France during childhood and up to the moment he was declared king at 17, so he probably had no command of the Romance language of Navarre at the moment of his coronation.

In October 1349, Charles&#x27;s mother died. In order to take his coronation oath and be anointed, he visited his kingdom in summer 1350. For the first time, the oath was taken in a language other than the customary Latin or Occitan, i.e. Navarro-Aragonese. Apart from short visits paid the first 12 years of his reign, Charles spent his time almost entirely in France; he regarded Navarre principally as a source of manpower with which to advance his designs on the throne of France. He hoped for a long time for recognition of his claim to the crown of France (as the heir-general of Philip IV through his mother, and a Capetian through his father). However, he was unable to wrest the throne from his Valois cousins, who were senior to him by agnatic primogeniture.

===Murder of Charles de la Cerda and relations with John II (1351–1356)===
Charles II served as Royal Lieutenant in Languedoc in 1351 and commanded the army which captured Port-Sainte-Marie on the Garonne in 1352. The same year he married Joan of Valois, the daughter of King John II of France. He soon became jealous of the Constable of France, Charles de La Cerda, who was to be a beneficiary of the fiefdom of Angoulême. Charles of Navarre felt he was entitled to these territories as they had belonged to his mother, the Queen of Navarre, but they had been taken from her by the French kings for a paltry sum in compensation.

After publicly quarrelling with Charles de la Cerda in Paris at Christmas 1353, Charles arranged the assassination of the Constable, which took place at the village of l&#x27;Aigle on 8 January 1354, with his brother Philip, Count of Longueville leading the murderers. Charles made no secret of his role in the murder, and within a few days was intriguing with the English for military support against his father-in-law King John II, whose favourite the Constable had been. John was preparing to attack his son-in-law&#x27;s territories, but Charles&#x27;s overtures of alliance to King Edward III of England led John to instead make peace with Charles with the Treaty of Mantes, enacted on 22 February 1354, by which Charles enlarged his possessions and was outwardly reconciled with John. The English, who had been preparing to invade France for a joint campaign with Charles against the French, felt they had been double-crossed: not for the last time, Charles had used the threat of an English alliance to wrest concessions out of the French king.
Relations between Charles and John once more deteriorated; in late 1354, John invaded Charles&#x27;s territories in Normandy, while Charles intrigued with the Duke of Lancaster, serving as emissary for Edward III, at fruitless peace negotiations between England and France held in the winter of 1354–55 at Avignon. Once again, Charles changed sides: the threat of a renewed English invasion forced John to make a new agreement of reconciliation with him, which was ultimately sealed by the Treaty of Valognes on 10 September 1355.

This agreement, too, did not last. Charles befriended and was thought to be trying to influence the Dauphin—the future Charles V—and was apparently involved in a botched coup d&#x27;état in December 1355, whose purpose appears to have been to replace John with the Dauphin. John amended matters by making his son Duke of Normandy, but Charles of Navarre continued to advise the Dauphin how to govern that province.

There were also continued rumours of his plots against the king, and on 5 April 1356 John II and a group of supporters burst unannounced into the Dauphin&#x27;s castle at Rouen, arrested Charles of Navarre and imprisoned him. Four of his principal supporters—two of whom had been among de la Cerda&#x27;s assassins—were beheaded, and their bodies suspended from chains. Charles was taken to Paris, and once there he was moved from prison to prison for greater security.

===Versus the Dauphin (1356–1358)===
After John was captured by the English following his defeat at the Battle of Poitiers, Charles remained in prison. However, many of his partisans were active in the Estates General, which endeavoured to govern and reform France in the power vacuum created by the imprisonment of the king, while much of the country degenerated into anarchy. They continually pressed the Dauphin to release him. Meanwhile his brother Philip of Navarre threw in his lot with the invading English army of the Duke of Lancaster, and made war on the Dauphin&#x27;s forces throughout Normandy. Eventually, on 9 November 1357, Charles was sprung from his prison in the castle of Arleux by a band of 30 men from Amiens led by Jean de Picquigny. Greeted as a hero when he entered Amiens, he was invited to Paris by the Estates General. He entered Paris with a large retinue, and was &#x27;received like a newly-crowned monarch&#x27;.

He addressed the populace on 30 November, listing his grievances against those who had imprisoned him. Étienne Marcel led a &#x27;demand for justice for the King of Navarre&#x27; which the Dauphin was unable to resist. Charles demanded an indemnity for all damage done to his territories while he had been imprisoned, free pardon for all his crimes and those of his supporters, and honourable burial for his associates executed by John II at Rouen. He also demanded the Dauphin&#x27;s own Duchy of Normandy and the County of Champagne, which would have made him the effective ruler of northern France.

The Dauphin was virtually powerless, but he and Charles were still in negotiations when news reached them that Edward and John were reaching a peace agreement. Knowing this could only be to his disadvantage, Charles had all the prisons in Paris opened to create anarchy, and left Paris to build up his strength in Normandy. In his absence the Dauphin tried to assemble a military force of his own. Charles meanwhile gave his executed followers a solemn state funeral in Rouen Cathedral on 10 January 1358 and effectively declared civil war, leading a combined Anglo-Navarrese force against the Dauphin&#x27;s garrisons.

===Revolution in Paris and the Jacquerie (1358)===
Meanwhile Paris was in the throes of revolution. On 22 February the Dauphin&#x27;s chief military officers, the marshals Jean de Conflans and Robert de Clermont were murdered before his eyes by a mob led by Etienne Marcel, who made the Dauphin a virtual prisoner and invited Charles of Navarre to return to the city, which he did on 26 February with a large armed retinue. The Dauphin was forced to agree to many of Charles&#x27;s territorial demands and to promise to finance for him a standing army of 1,000 men for his personal use. However illness prevented Charles from escorting the Dauphin to meetings demanded by the nobility at Senlis and Provins, and the Dauphin was thus able to escape his Parisian and Navarrese guardians and open a campaign from the east against Charles and against revolutionary Paris.

Etienne Marcel implored Charles to intercede with the Dauphin but he achieved nothing and the land around Paris began to be plundered both by Charles&#x27;s forces and by the Dauphin&#x27;s. In the last days of May the peasant rebellion of the Jacquerie erupted to the north of Paris as a spontaneous expression of hatred for the nobility that had brought France so low. Etienne Marcel publicly declared Parisian support for the Jacquerie. Unable to get help from the Dauphin, the knights of northern France appealed to Charles of Navarre to lead them against the peasants.

Although he was allied with the Parisians, Charles was no lover of the peasantry and felt Marcel had made a fatal mistake. He could not resist the chance to appear as a leader of the French aristocracy and led the suppression of the Jacquerie at the Battle of Mello, 10 June 1358 and the subsequent massacres of rebels. He then returned to Paris and made an open bid for power urging the populace to elect him as &#x27;Captain of Paris&#x27;.

This move lost Charles the support of many of the nobles who had supported him against the Jacquerie, and they began to abandon him for the Dauphin while he recruited soldiers—mainly English mercenaries—for the &#x27;defence&#x27; of Paris, though his men, picketed outside the city, raided and plundered far and wide. Realizing the Dauphin&#x27;s forces were much stronger than his, Charles opened negotiations with the Dauphin, who made him substantial offers of cash and land if he could induce the Parisians to surrender. They, however, distrusted this deal between princes and refused the terms outright; Charles agreed to fight on as their captain but demanded that his troops be billeted in the city.

Before long there were anti-English riots in the city and Charles, with Etienne Marcel, was forced by the mob to lead them against the marauding garrisons to the north and west of the city—against his own men. He led them (no doubt deliberately) into an English ambush in the woods near the bridge of Saint-Cloud and about 600 Parisians were killed.

===Capitulation (1359–60)===
After this debacle Charles stayed outside Paris at the Abbey of St Denis and left the city to its fate while the revolution burned itself out, Etienne Marcel was killed, and the Dauphin regained control of Paris. Meanwhile he opened negotiations with the English King, proposing that Edward III and he should divide France between themselves: if Edward would invade France and help him defeat the Dauphin, he would recognize Edward as King of France and do homage to him for the territories of Normandy, Picardy, Champagne and Brie. But the English king no longer trusted Charles and both he and the captive John II regarded him as an obstacle to peace. On 24 March 1359, Edward and John concluded a new treaty in London whereby John would be released back to France on payment of a huge ransom and would make over to Edward III large tracts of French territory—including all of Charles of Navarre&#x27;s French lands. Unless Charles submitted and accept suitable (undefined) compensation elsewhere, the Kings of England and France would jointly make war on him. However the Estates General refused to accept the treaty, urging the Dauphin to continue the war. At this Edward III lost patience and decided to invade France himself. Charles of Navarre&#x27;s military position in Northern France had deteriorated under attacks from the Dauphin&#x27;s forces throughout the spring, and with the news of Edward&#x27;s impending invasion Charles decided he must reach an accommodation with the Dauphin. After protracted haggling the two leaders met near Pontoise on 19 August 1359; on the second day Charles of Navarre publicly renounced all his demands for territory and money, saying he wanted nothing more than what he had at the beginning of hostilities and &#x27;wanted nothing more than to do his duty to his country&#x27;. It is unclear whether he was actuated by patriotism in the face of an imminent English invasion, or had decided to bide his time until a more favourable juncture to renew his campaign. After the comparative failure of Edward&#x27;s campaign in the winter of 1359–60—the Dauphin did not offer battle, instead pursuing a &#x27;scorched earth&#x27; policy, with the populace seeking shelter inside walled towns while the English endured terrible weather—a final peace treaty was agreed between Edward and John at Brétigny, while John II concluded a separate peace with Charles of Navarre at Calais. Charles was forgiven his crimes against France and restored to all his rights and properties; 300 of his followers received a royal pardon. In return, he renewed his homage to the French crown and promised to help clear the French provinces of the marauding companies of Anglo-Navarrese mercenaries, many of which he had been responsible for unleashing in the first place.
===Burgundian inheritance and the loss of Normandy (1361–1365)===
In 1361, after the death of his second cousin the young Duke Philip I of Burgundy, Charles claimed the Duchy of Burgundy by primogeniture. He was the grandson of Margaret, eldest daughter of Duke Robert II of Burgundy (d. 1306). However, the duchy was taken by King John II, who was son of Joan, second daughter of Duke Robert II, who claimed it in proximity of blood, and made provision that after his death it would pass to his favourite son Philip the Bold.

To have become Duke of Burgundy would have given Charles the position at the centre of French politics that he had always craved, and the abrupt dismissal of his claim provoked fresh bitterness. After the failure of an attempt to win Pope Innocent VI to his claim, Charles returned to his kingdom of Navarre in November 1361. He was soon plotting afresh to become a power in France. A planned rising of his supporters in Normandy in May 1362 was an abject failure, but in 1363 he evolved an ambitious plan to form two armies in 1364, one of which would go by sea to Normandy and the other, under his brother Louis, would join forces with the Gascons operating with the Great Company in Central France and invade Burgundy, thus threatening the French King from both sides of his realm. In January 1364 Charles met Edward, the Black Prince, at Agen in order to negotiate the passage of his troops through the English-held duchy of Aquitaine, to which the Prince agreed perhaps because of his friendship with Charles&#x27;s new military adviser Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch, who had been betrothed to Charles&#x27; sister and was to lead his army to Normandy. In March 1364 the Captal marched towards Normandy to secure Charles&#x27;s domains.

John II of France had returned to London to negotiate with Edward III, and the defence of France was once more in the hands of the Dauphin. There was already a royal army in Normandy besieging the town of Rolleboise, nominally commanded by the Count of Auxerre but actually generalled by Bertrand du Guesclin. Charles&#x27;s designs were well known in advance and in early April 1364 this force seized many of Charles&#x27;s remaining strongholds before the Captal de Buch could reach Normandy. When he arrived he started concentrating his forces around Évreux, which still held out for Charles. He then led his army against the royal forces to the east. On 16 May 1364 he was defeated by du Guesclin at the Battle of Cocherel. John II had died in England in April, and news of the victory of Cocherel reached the Dauphin on 18 May at Rheims, where on the following day he was crowned Charles V of France. He immediately confirmed his brother Philip as Duke of Burgundy.

Undeterred by this resounding defeat, Charles of Navarre persisted in his grand design. In August 1364 his men began a fight back in Normandy while a small Navarrese army under Rodrigo de Uriz sailed from Bayonne to Cherbourg. Meanwhile Charles&#x27;s brother Louis of Navarre led an army augmented by contingents pledged by the captains of the Great Company and the freebooter Seguin de Badefol through the Black Prince&#x27;s territories and across France, evading the French royal forces sent to intercept him and arrived in Normandy on 23 September. Hearing of the collapse of the civil war in Brittany after the Battle of Auray on 29 September, Louis abandoned his design to invade Burgundy and instead set about reconquering the Cotentin for Charles. Meanwhile Séguin de Badefol and his fellow-captains captured the town of Anse on the Burgundian border, but only to use it as a centre for raiding and plundering far and wide. They did Charles of Navarre&#x27;s cause no discernible good, and Pope Urban V excommunicated Séguin. Although Charles offered Bernard-Aiz V, Lord of Albret, huge sums to take over the command of his forces around Burgundy, he finally realized he could not prevail against the King of France and must come to an accommodation with him. In May 1365, in Pamplona, he agreed to a treaty by which there was to be a general amnesty for his supporters, the remains of Navarrese executed and displayed for treason were to be returned to their families, prisoners would be mutually released without ransom. Charles was allowed to keep his conquests of 1364, except for the citadel of Meulan, which was to be razed to the ground. In compensation Charles received Montpellier in Bas-Languedoc. His claim to Burgundy was to be referred to the arbitration of the Pope. The Pope never in fact pronounced on the matter. It was an ignominious end to Charles&#x27;s 15 years of struggle to create a major territory for himself and his line in France. Henceforth he resided mainly in his kingdom.

At the end of 1365 Séguin de Badefol arrived in Navarre to claim the considerable sums Charles had pledged to pay him for his services in Burgundy, even though he had achieved nothing of substance. Charles was not pleased to see him, received him in private and poisoned him with a crystallised pear.

===Charles and the Spanish Wars (1365–1368)===
The cessation of war in France left vast numbers of French, English, Gascon and Navarrese soldiers and freebooters in search of mercenary employment, and many of these soon became involved in the wars of Castille and Aragon, both of which bordered Navarre. Charles typically tried to exploit the situation by making agreements with both sides that would enlarge his territory while leaving Navarre itself relatively untouched. Officially he was ally of Peter of Castile, but at the end of 1365 he concluded a secret agreement with Peter IV of Aragon to allow the marauding army led by Bertrand du Guesclin and Hugh Calveley to invade Castile through southern Navarre in order to depose Pedro I and supplant him with his half-brother Henry of Trastámara. He then reneged on his agreements to both sides and attempted to hold the Navarrese borders intact, but was unable to do so and instead paid the invaders a large sum to keep their plundering to a minimum.

After Henry of Trastámara successfully seized the throne of Castile, Pedro I fled to the court of the Black Prince in Aquitaine, who began to plot his restoration by sending an army across the Pyrenees. In July 1366 Charles himself came to Bordeaux to consult with Pedro I and the Prince and agreed to keep the mountain passes of Navarre open for the passage of the army, for which he would be rewarded with the Castilian provinces of Guipúzcoa and Álava as well as additional fortresses and a large cash payment. Then in December he met Henry of Trastámara on the Navarrese border and promised instead to hold the passes closed, in return for the border town of Logroño and more cash. Hearing of this the Black Prince ordered Hugh Calveley to invade Navarre from northern Castile and enforce the original agreement. Charles at once capitulated, claiming he had never been sincere in his dealings with Henry, and opened the passes to the Prince&#x27;s army. Charles accompanied them on their journey but, not wanting to take part in the campaign personally, got Olivier de Mauny to stage an ambush in which Charles was &#x27;captured&#x27; and held until the reconquest of Castile was over. The ruse was so transparent it made Charles a laughing-stock in Western Europe.

===Last French possessions lost and the humbling of Navarre (1369–79)===
With the resumption of war between France and England in 1369 Charles saw fresh opportunities to increase his status in France. He left Navarre and met Duke John V of Brittany in Nantes, where they agreed to come to each other&#x27;s aid if either was attacked by France. Basing himself in Cherbourg, the principal town in what remained of his territories in Northern Normandy, he then sent ambassadors to Charles V of France and Edward III of England. He offered to aid the French King if he would restore his former territories in Normandy, recognize his claim to Burgundy and bestow the promised lordship of Montpellier. To the English king he offered an alliance against France, whereby Edward III could use his territories in Normandy as a base to attack the French. As on previous occasions, Charles did not really want an English army on his lands; he wanted the threat of one to put pressure on Charles V. But Charles V refused his demands outright. On the strength of Charles of Navarre&#x27;s offers, Edward III despatched an expeditionary force to the Seine estuary under Sir Robert Knolles in July of 1370. He invited Charles to come to England in person—which he did during that same month. Charles of Navarre entered into secret negotiations with Edward III at Clarendon Palace, but committed himself to very little. Simultaneously he continued to negotiate with Charles V, who feared the King of Navarre would throw in his lot with Knolles&#x27;s army now operating in Northern France. Though Edward III sealed a draft treaty with Navarre on 2 December 1370 it was a dead letter after the destruction of Knolles&#x27;s army at the Battle of Pontvallain a few days later. During March of 1371, seeing no option left, Charles of Navarre had a series of meetings with Charles V and did homage to him.

Having gained little or nothing from these activities, he returned to Navarre in early 1372. He was subsequently involved in at least two attempts to have Charles V poisoned and encouraged various plots by others against the French King. He next entered into negotiations with John of Gaunt, who was aiming to make himself King of Castile by virtue of his marriage to Pedro I&#x27;s daughter Constanza. But in 1373 Henry of Trastámara, now firmly installed as King of Castile and victorious in war against England&#x27;s ally Portugal, forced Charles to agree to a marriage alliance, to surrender the disputed border fortresses he had held on to since the Castilian civil war, and to close his borders to any army of John of Gaunt. Nevertheless in March 1374 Charles met John of Gaunt in Dax in Gascony and agreed to let him use Navarre as a base for invading Castile on condition he recapture the towns surrendered to Henry. Gaunt&#x27;s sudden decision only a few days later to abandon his plans and return to England Charles took as a personal betrayal. In order to placate the Castilian King he now agreed for his eldest son, the future Charles III of Navarre, to marry Henry of Trastámara&#x27;s daughter Leonora in May 1375.

In 1377 he proposed to the English that he would return to Normandy and put the harbours and castles he still controlled there at their disposal for a joint attack on France; he also proposed that his daughter should be married to the new English king, the young Richard II. But the threat of an attack by Castile forced Charles to remain in Navarre. Instead he sent off his eldest son to Normandy, with a number of officials, including his chamberlain Jacques de Rue, who were to prepare his castles to receive the English, as well as a servant whose mission was to insinuate himself into the royal kitchens in Paris and poison the King of France. Meanwhile he urgently appealed for the English to send him reinforcements from Gascony to help him fight the Castilians. But in March 1378 all his plots finally unravelled. On their way to Normandy the Navarrese delegation were arrested at Nemours. The draft treaties and correspondence with the English found in their baggage, along with Jacques de Rue&#x27;s confessions under interrogation, were all that Charles V needed to send an army into northern Normandy to capture all the King of Navarre&#x27;s remaining domains there (April–June 1378). Only Cherbourg held out: Charles of Navarre begged the English to send him reinforcements there but instead they seized it for themselves and garrisoned it against the French. Charles&#x27;s son submitted to the French King and became a protégé of the Duke of Burgundy, fighting in the French armies. Jacques de la Rue and other prominent Navarrese officials in France were executed.

From June–July 1378 the armies of Castile, commanded by John of Trastámara, invaded Navarre and laid the country waste. Charles II retreated over the Pyrenees to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port and in October he made his way to Bordeaux to plead for military aid from Sir John Neville, the Lieutenant of Gascony. Neville despatched a small force to Navarre under the knight Sir Thomas Trivet, but the English achieved little over the winter and in February Henry of Trastámara announced his son would re-invade Navarre in the spring. Having no options or allies left Charles II asked for a truce, and by the Treaty of Briones on 31 March 1379 agreed to Henry&#x27;s demands that he agree to be bound in perpetual military alliance with Castile and France against the English, and to surrender 20 fortresses of southern Navarre, including the city of Tudela, to Castilian garrisons.

Charles of Navarre&#x27;s remarkably slippery and devious political career was at an end. He retained his crown and his country but he was effectively a humiliated client of his enemies, he had lost his French territories and his Pyrenean realm was devastated and impoverished by war. Though he continued to scheme and even still to consider himself the rightful King of France, he was essentially neutralized and impotent for the years that remained until his gruesome death.

===Marriage and children===
He married Joan of France (1343–1373), daughter of King John II of France. He had the following children by Joan:
# Marie (1360, Puente la Reina – aft. 1400), married in Tudela on 20 January 1393 Alfonso d&#x27;Aragona, Duke of Gandia
# Charles III of Navarre (1361–1425)
# Bonne (1364 – aft. 1389)
# Pedro, Count of Mortain (c. 31 March 1366, Évreux – , Bourges), married in Alençon on 21 April 1411 Catherine of Alençon (1380–1462), daughter of Peter II of Alençon. He had a son out of wedlock named Pedro Perez de Peralta 1400–1451.
# Philip (b. 1368), d. young
# Joanna of Navarre (1370–1437), married firstly John IV, Duke of Brittany, married secondly Henry IV of England
# Blanche (1372–1385, Olite)

===Death===
Charles died in Pamplona, aged 54. His horrific death became famous all over Europe, and was often cited by moralists, and sometimes illustrated in illuminated manuscript chronicles. There are several versions of the story, varying in the details. This is Francis Blagdon&#x27;s English account, of 1803:
John Cassell&#x27;s moralistic version states:
