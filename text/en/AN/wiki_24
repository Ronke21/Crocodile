<text>Louis Pierre Althusser (, ; ; 16 October 1918 – 22 October 1990) was a French Marxist philosopher who studied at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, where he eventually became Professor of Philosophy.

Althusser was a long-time member and sometimes a strong critic of the French Communist Party. His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of empiricism on Marxist theory, and humanist and reformist orientations which manifested as divisions in the European communist parties, as well as the problem of the cult of personality and of ideology. Althusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French structuralism is not a simple affiliation and he was critical of many aspects of structuralism. He later described himself as a social anarchist.

Althusser&#x27;s life was marked by periods of intense mental illness. In 1980, he killed his wife, the sociologist Hélène Rytmann, by strangling her. He was declared unfit to stand trial due to insanity and committed to a psychiatric hospital for three years. He did little further academic work, dying in 1990.

==Biography==
===Early life: 1918–1948===
Althusser was born in French Algeria in the town of Birmendreïs, near Algiers, to a &quot;pied-noir&quot; petit-bourgeois family from Alsace, France. His father, Charles-Joseph Althusser, was a lieutenant in the French army and a bank clerk, while his mother, Lucienne Marthe Berger, a devout Catholic, worked as a schoolteacher. According to his own memoirs, his Algerian childhood was prosperous; historian Martin Jay said that Althusser, along with Albert Camus and Jacques Derrida, was &quot;a product of the French colonial culture in Northern Africa.&quot; In 1930, his family moved to the French city of Marseille as his father was to be the director of the Compagnie Algérienne bank branch in the city. Althusser spent the rest of his childhood there, excelling in his studies at the and joining a scout group. A second displacement occurred in 1936 when Althusser settled in Lyon as a student at the Lycée du Parc. Later he was accepted by the highly regarded higher-education establishment (&quot;grande école&quot;) École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris. At the Lycée du Parc, Althusser was influenced by Catholic professors, joined the Catholic youth movement Jeunesse Étudiante Chrétienne, and wanted to be a Trappist. His interest in Catholicism coexisted with his communist ideology, and some critics argued that his early Catholic introduction affected the way he interpreted Karl Marx.

After a two-year period of preparation (&quot;Khâgne&quot;) under Jean Guitton at the Lycée du Parc, Althusser was admitted into the ENS in July 1939. But his attendance was deferred by many years because he was drafted into the French Army in September of that year in the run-up to World War II and, like most French soldiers following the Fall of France, was captured by the Germans. Seized in Vannes in June 1940, he was held in a prisoner-of-war camp in Schleswig-Holstein, in Northern Germany, for the five remaining years of the war. In the camp, he was at first drafted to hard labour but ultimately reassigned to work in the infirmary after falling ill. This second occupation allowed him to read philosophy and literature. In his memoirs, Althusser described the experiences of solidarity, political action, and community in the camp as the moment he first understood the idea of communism. Althusser recalled: &quot;It was in prison camp that I first heard Marxism discussed by a Parisian lawyer in transit—and that I actually met a communist&quot;. His experience in the camp also affected his lifelong bouts of mental instability, reflected in constant depression that lasted until the end of life. Psychoanalyst Élisabeth Roudinesco has argued that the absurd war experience was essential for Althusser&#x27;s philosophical thought.

Althusser resumed his studies at the ENS in 1945 to prepare himself for the &quot;agrégation&quot;, an exam to teach philosophy in secondary schools. In 1946, Althusser met sociologist Hélène Rytmann, a Jewish former French Resistance member with whom he was in a relationship until he killed her by strangulation in 1980. That same year, he started a close friendly relationship with Jacques Martin, a translator of G. W. F. Hegel and Hermann Hesse. Martin, to whom Althusser dedicated his first book, would later commit suicide. Martin was influential on Althusser&#x27;s interest on reading the bibliography of Jean Cavaillès, Georges Canguilhem and Hegel. Although Althusser remained a Catholic, he became more associated with left-wing groups, joining the &quot;worker-priests&quot; movement and embracing a synthesis of Christian and Marxist thought. This combination may have led him to adopt German Idealism and Hegelian thought, as did Martin&#x27;s influence and a renewed interest in Hegel in the 1930s and 1940s in France. In consonance, Althusser&#x27;s master thesis to obtain his &quot;diplôme d&#x27;études supèrieures&quot; was &quot;On Content in the Thought of G. W. F. Hegel&quot; (&quot;Du contenu dans la pensée de G. W. F. Hegel&quot;, 1947). Based on &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;, and under Gaston Bachelard&#x27;s supervision, Althusser wrote a dissertation on how Marx&#x27;s philosophy refused to withdraw from the Hegelian master–slave dialectic. According to the researcher Gregory Elliott, Althusser was a Hegelian at that time but only for a short period.

===Academic life and Communist Party affiliation: 1948–1959===
In 1948, he was approved to teach in secondary schools but instead made a tutor at the ENS to help students prepare for their own &quot;agrégation&quot;. His performance on the exam—he was the best ranked on the writing part and second on the oral module—guaranteed this change on his occupation. He was responsible for offering special courses and tutorials on particular topics and on particular figures from the history of philosophy. In 1954, he became (secretary of the literary school), assuming responsibilities for management and direction of the school. Althusser was deeply influential at the ENS because of the lectures and conferences he organized with participation of leading French philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Lacan. He also influenced a generation of French philosophers and French philosophy in general—among his students were Derrida, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Foucault, and Michel Serres. In total, Althusser spent 35 years in the ENS, working there until November 1980. 

Parallel to his academic life, Althusser joined the French Communist Party (&quot;Parti communiste français&quot;, PCF) in October 1948. In the early postwar years, the PCF was one of the most influential political forces and many French intellectuals joined it. Althusser himself declared, &quot;Communism was in the air in 1945, after the German defeat, the victory at Stalingrad, and the hopes and lessons of the Resistance.&quot; Althusser was primarily active on the &quot;Peace Movement&quot; section and kept for a few years his Catholic beliefs; in 1949, he published in the &quot;L&#x27;Évangile captif&quot; (The captive gospel), the tenth book of the Jeunesse de l&#x27;Église (the youth wing of Church), an article on the historic situation of Catholicism in response to the question: &quot;Is the good news preached to the men today?&quot; In it, he wrote about the relationship between the Catholic Church and the labour movement, advocating at the same time for social emancipation and the Church &quot;religious reconquest&quot;. There was mutual hostility between these two organizations—in the early 1950s, the Vatican prohibited Catholics from membership in the worker priests and left-wing movements—and it certainly affected Althusser since he firmly believed in this combination.

Initially afraid of joining the party because of ENS&#x27;s opposition to communists, Althusser did so when he was made a tutor—when membership became less likely to affect his employment—and he even created at ENA the &quot;Cercle Politzer&quot;, a Marxist study group. Althusser also introduced colleagues and students to the party and worked closely with the communist cell of the ENS. But his professionalism made him avoid Marxism and Communism in his classes; instead, he helped students depending on the demands of their &quot;agrégation&quot;. In the early 1950s, Althusser distanced himself from his youthful political and philosophical ideals and from Hegel, whose teachings he considered a &quot;bourgeois&quot; philosophy. Starting from 1948, he studied history of philosophy and gave lectures on it; the first was about Plato in 1949. In 1949–1950, he gave a lecture about René Descartes, and wrote a thesis titled &quot;Politics and Philosophy in the Eighteenth Century&quot; and a small study on Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Second Discourse&quot;. He presented the thesis to Jean Hyppolite and Vladimir Jankélévitch in 1950 but it was rejected. These studies were nonetheless valuable because Althusser later used them to write his book about Montesquieu&#x27;s philosophy and an essay on Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;The Social Contract&quot;. Indeed, his first and the only book-length study published during his lifetime was &quot;Montesquieu, la politique et l&#x27;histoire&quot; (&quot;Montesquieu: Politics and History&quot;) in 1959. He also lectured on Rousseau from 1950 to 1955, and changed his focus to philosophy of history, also studying Voltaire, Condorcet, and Helvétius, which resulted in a 1955–1956 lecture on &quot;Les problèmes de la philosophie de l&#x27;histoire&quot;. This course along with others on Machiavelli (1962), 17th- and 18th-century political philosophy (1965–1966), Locke (1971), and Hobbes (1971–1972) were later edited and released as a book by François Matheron in 2006. From 1953 to 1960, Althusser basically did not publish on Marxist themes, which in turn gave him time to focus on his teaching activities and establish himself as a reputable philosopher and researcher. 

===Major works, &quot;For Marx&quot; and &quot;Reading Capital&quot;: 1960–1968===
Althusser resumed his Marxist-related publications in 1960 as he translated, edited, and published a collection directed by Hyppolite about Ludwig Feuerbach&#x27;s works. The objective of this endeavour was to identify Feuerbach&#x27;s influence on Marx&#x27;s early writings, contrasting it with the absence of his thought on Marx&#x27;s mature works. This work spurred him to write &quot;On the Young Marx: Theoretical Questions&quot; (&quot;Sur le jeune Marx – Questions de théorie&quot;, 1961). Published in the journal &quot;La Pensée&quot;, it was the first in a series of articles about Marx that were later collected in his most famous book &quot;For Marx&quot;. He inflamed the French debate on Marx and Marxist philosophy, and gained a considerable number of supporters. Inspired by this recognition, he started to publish more articles on Marxist thought; in 1964, Althusser published an article titled &quot;Freud and Lacan&quot; in the journal &quot;La Nouvelle Critique&quot;, which greatly influenced the Freudo-Marxism thought. At the same time, he invited Lacan to a lecture on Baruch Spinoza and the fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis. The impact of the articles led Althusser to change his teaching style at the ENS, and he started to minister a series of seminars on the following topics: &quot;On the Young Marx&quot; (1961–1962), &quot;The Origins of Structuralism&quot; (1962–1963; it versed on Foucault&#x27;s &quot;History of Madness&quot;, which Althusser highly appreciated), &quot;Lacan and Psychoanalysis&quot; (1963–1964), and &quot;Reading Capital&quot; (1964–1965). These seminars aimed for a &quot;return to Marx&quot; and were attended by a new generation of students.

&quot;For Marx&quot; (a collection of works published between 1961 and 1965) and &quot;Reading Capital&quot; (in collaboration with some of his students), both published in 1965, brought international fame to Althusser. Despite being criticized widely, these books made Althusser a sensation in French intellectual circles and one of the leading theoreticians of the PCF. He supported a structuralist view of Marx&#x27;s work, influenced by Cavaillès and Canguilhem, affirming that Marx laid the &quot;cornerstones&quot; of a new science, incomparable to all non-Marxist thought, of which, from 1960 to 1966, he espoused the fundamental principles. Critiques were done to Stalin&#x27;s cult of personality and Althusser defended what he called &quot;theoretical anti-humanism&quot;, as an alternative to Stalinism and the Marxist humanism—both popular at the time. At mid-decade, his popularity grew to the point that it was virtually impossible to have an intellectual debate about political or ideological theoretical questions without mentioning his name. Althusser&#x27;s ideas were influential enough to arouse the creation of a young militants group to dispute the power within the PCF. Nevertheless, the official position of the party was still Stalinist Marxism, which was criticized both from Maoist and humanist groups. Althusser was initially careful not to identify with Maoism but progressively agreed with its critique of Stalinism. At the end of 1966, Althusser even published an unsigned article titled &quot;On the Cultural Revolution&quot;, in which he considered the beginning of the Chinese Cultural Revolution as &quot;a historical fact without precedent&quot; and of &quot;enormous theoretical interest&quot;. Althusser mainly praised the non-bureaucratic, non-party, mass organizations in which, in his opinion, the &quot;Marxist principles regarding the nature of the ideological&#x27; were fully applied.

Key events in the theoretical struggle took place in 1966. In January, there was a conference of communist philosophers in Choisy-le-Roi; Althusser was absent but Roger Garaudy, the official philosopher of the party, read an indictment that opposed the &quot;theoretical anti-humanism&quot;. The controversy was the pinnacle of a long conflict between the supporters of Althusser and Garaudy. In March, in Argenteuil, the theses of Garaudy and Althusser were formally confronted by the PCF Central Committee, chaired by Louis Aragon. The Party decided to keep Garaudy&#x27;s position as the official one, and even Lucien Sève—who was a student of Althusser at the beginning of his teaching at the ENS—supported it, becoming the closest philosopher to the PCF leadership. General secretary of the party, Waldeck Rochet said that &quot;Communism without humanism would not be Communism&quot;. Even if he was not publicly censured nor expelled from the PCF, as were 600 Maoist students, the support of Garaudy resulted in a further reduction of Althusser&#x27;s influence in the party.

Still in 1966, Althusser published in the &quot;Cahiers pour l&#x27;Analyse&quot; the article &quot;On the &#x27;Social Contract&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Sur le &#x27;Contrat Social&#x27;&quot;), a course about Rousseau he had given at the ENS, and &quot;Cremonini, Painter of the Abstract&quot; (&quot;Cremonini, peintre de l&#x27;abstrait&quot;) about Italian painter Leonardo Cremonini. In the following year, he wrote a long article titled &quot;The Historical Task of Marxist Philosophy&quot; (&quot;La tâche historique de la philosophie marxiste&quot;) that was submitted to the Soviet journal &quot;Voprossi Filosofii&quot;; it was not accepted but was published a year later in a Hungarian journal. In 1967–1968, Althusser and his students organized an ENS course titled &quot;Philosophy Course for Scientists&quot; (&quot;Cours de philosophie pour scientifiques&quot;) that would be interrupted by May 1968 events. Some of the material of the course was reused in his 1974 book &quot;Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientists&quot; (&quot;Philosophie et philosophie spontanée des savants&quot;). Another Althusser&#x27;s significant work from this period was &quot;Lenin and Philosophy&quot;, a lecture first presented in February 1968 at the .

===May 1968, Eurocommunism debates, and auto-critique: 1968–1978===
During May 68, the tumultuous events of May 1968 in France, Althusser was hospitalized because of a depressive breakdown and was absent from the Latin Quarter. Many of his students participated in the events, and Régis Debray in particular became an international celebrity revolutionary. Althusser&#x27;s initial silence was met with criticism by the protesters, who wrote on walls: &quot;Of what use is Althusser?&quot; (&quot;A quoi sert Althusser?&quot;). Later, Althusser was ambivalent about it; on the one hand, he was not supportive of the movement and he criticized the movement as an &quot;ideological revolt of the mass&quot;, adopting the PCF official argument that an &quot;infantile disorder&quot; of anarchistic utopianism that had infiltrated the student movement. On the other hand, he called it &quot;the most significant event in Western history since the Resistance and the victory over Nazism&quot; and wanted to reconcile the students and the PCF. Nevertheless, the Maoist journal &quot;La Cause du peuple&quot; called him a revisionist, and he was condemned by former students, mainly by Jacques Rancière. After it, Althusser went through a phase of &quot;self-criticism&quot; that resulted in the book &quot;Essays in Self-criticism&quot; (&quot;Éléments d&#x27;autocritique&quot;, 1974) in which he revisited some of his old positions, including his support of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.

In 1969, Althusser started an unfinished work that was only released in 1995 as &quot;Sur la reproduction&quot; (&quot;On the Reproduction&quot;). However, from these early manuscripts, he developed &quot;Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses&quot;, which was published in the journal &quot;La Pensée&quot; in 1970, and became very influential on ideology discussions. In the same year, Althusser wrote &quot;Marxism and Class Struggle&quot; (&quot;Marxisme et lutte de classe&quot;) that would be the foreword to the book &quot;The Basic Concepts of Historical Materialism&quot; of his former student, the Chilean Marxist sociologist Marta Harnecker. By this time, Althusser was very popular in Latin America: some leftist activists and intellectuals saw him almost as a new Marx, although his work has been the subject of heated debates and sharp criticism. As an example of this popularity, some of his works were first translated to Spanish than into English, and others were released in book format first in Spanish and then in French. At the turn from the 1960s to the 1970s, Althusser&#x27;s major works were translated into English—&quot;For Marx&quot;, in 1969, and &quot;Reading Capital&quot; in 1970—disseminating his ideas among the English-speaking Marxists.

In the early 1970s, the PCF was, as most of European Communist parties, in a period of internal conflicts on strategic orientation that occurred against the backdrop of the emergence of Eurocommunism. In this context, Althusserian structuralist Marxism was one of the more or less defined strategic lines. Althusser participated in various public events of the PCF, most notably the public debate &quot;Communists, Intellectuals and Culture&quot; (&quot;Les communistes, les intellectuels et la culture&quot;) in 1973. He and his supporters contested the party&#x27;s leadership over its decision to abandon the notion of the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; during its twenty-second congress in 1976. The PCF considered that in the European context it was possible to have a peaceful transition to socialism, which Althusser saw as &quot;a new opportunistic version of Marxist Humanism&quot;. In a lecture given to the Union of Communist Students in the same year, he criticized above all the form in which this decision was taken. According to Althusser—echoing his notion of &quot;French misery&quot; exposed on &quot;For Marx&quot;—the party demonstrated a contempt for the materialist theory when it suppressed a &quot;scientific concept&quot;. This struggle ultimately resulted in the debacle of the fraction &quot;Union of the Left&quot; and an open letter written by Althusser and five other intellectuals in which they asked for &quot;a real political discussion in the PCF&quot;. That same year, Althusser also published a series of articles in the newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; under the title of &quot;What Must Change in the Party&quot;. Published between 25 and 28 April, they were expanded and reprinted in May 1978 by François Maspero as the book &quot;Ce qui ne peut plus durer dans le parti communiste&quot;. Between 1977 and 1978, Althusser mainly elaborated texts criticizing Eurocommunism and the PCF. &quot;Marx in his Limits&quot; (&quot;Marx dans ses limits&quot;), an abandoned manuscript written in 1978, argued that there was no Marxist theory of the state; it was only published in 1994 in the &quot;Écrits philosophiques et politiques I&quot;. The Italian Communist newspaper &quot;Il manifesto&quot; allowed Althusser to develop new ideas on a conference held in Venice about &quot;Power and Opposition in Post-Revolutionary Societies&quot; in 1977. His speeches resulted into the articles &quot;The Crisis of Marxism&quot; (&quot;La crisi del marxismo&quot;) and &quot;Marxism as a &#x27;finite&#x27; theory&quot; in which he stressed &quot;something vital and alive can be liberated by this crisis&quot;: the perception of Marxism as a theory that originally only reflected Marx&#x27;s time and then needed to be completed by a state theory. The former was published as &quot;Marxism Today&quot; (&quot;Marxismo oggi&quot;) in the 1978 Italian &quot;Enciclopedia Europea&quot;. The latter text was included in a book published in Italy, &quot;Discutere lo Stato&quot;, and he criticized the notion of &quot;government party&quot; and defended the notion of a revolutionary party &quot;out of state&quot;.

During the 1970s, Althusser&#x27;s institutional roles at the ENS increased but he still edited and published his and other works in the series &quot;Théorie&quot;, with François Maspero. Among the essays published, there was &quot;Response to John Lewis&quot;, a 1973 reply of an English Communist&#x27;s defence of Marxist Humanism. Two years later, he concluded his &quot;Doctorat d&#x27;État&quot; (State doctorate) in the University of Picardie Jules Verne and acquired the right to direct research on the basis of his previously published work. Some time after this recognition, Althusser married Hélène Rytmann. In 1976, he compiled several of his essays written between 1964 and 1975 to publish &quot;Positions&quot;. These years would be a period in which his work was very intermittent; he gave a conference titled &quot;The Transformation of Philosophy&quot; (&quot;La transformation de la philosophie&quot;) in two Spanish cities, first Granada and then in Madrid, in March 1976. The same year he gave a lecture in Catalonia titled &quot;Quelques questions de la crise de la théorie marxiste et du mouvement communiste international&quot; (&quot;Some Questions on the Crisis of Marxist Theory and the International Communist Movement&quot;) in which Althusser outlined empiricism as the main enemy of class struggle. He also started a rereading of Machiavelli that would influence his later work; he worked between 1975 and 1976 on &quot;Machiavel et nous&quot; (&quot;Machiavelli and Us&quot;), a draft, only published posthumously, based on a 1972 lecture, and also wrote for the National Foundation of Political Science a piece titled &quot;Machiavelli&#x27;s Solitude&quot; (&quot;Solitude de Machiavel&quot;, 1977). In Spring 1976, requested by Léon Chertok to write for the International Symposium on the Unconscious at Tbilisi, he drafted a presentation titled &quot;The Discovery of Dr. Freud&quot; (&quot;La découverte du docteur Freud&quot;). After sending it to Chertok and some friends, he was unsettled by the requested criticism he received by Jacques Nassif and Roudinesco, and then, by December, he wrote a new essay, &quot;On Marx and Freud&quot;. He could not attend the event in 1979 and asked Chertok to replace the texts, but Chertok published the first without his consent. This would become a public &quot;affair&quot; in 1984 when Althusser finally noticed it by the time Chertok republished it in a book titled &quot;Dialogue franco-soviétique, sur la psychanalyse&quot;.

=== Killing of Rytmann and late years: 1978–1990 ===
After the PCF and the left were defeated in the French legislative elections of 1978, Althusser&#x27;s bouts of depression became more severe and frequent. In March 1980, Althusser interrupted the dissolution session of the École Freudienne de Paris, and, &quot;in the name of the analysts&quot;, called Lacan a &quot;beautiful and pitiful harlequin.&quot; Later, he went through a hiatal hernia-removal surgery as he had difficulties breathing while eating. According to Althusser himself, the operation caused his physical and mental state to deteriorate; in particular, he developed a persecution complex and suicidal thoughts. He would recall later:
After the surgery, in May, he was hospitalized for most of the summer in a Parisian clinic. His condition did not improve, but in early October he was sent home. Upon returning, he wanted to get away from ENS and even proposed to buy Roudinesco&#x27;s house. He and Rytmann were also convinced about the &quot;human decline&quot;, and so he tried to talk to the Pope John Paul II through his former professor Jean Guitton. Most of the time, however, he and his wife spent locked in their ENS apartment. In the fall of 1980, Althusser&#x27;s psychiatrist René Diatkine, who by now was also treating Althusser&#x27;s wife Hélène Rytmann, recommended that Althusser be hospitalized, but the couple refused.

On 16 November 1980, Althusser strangled Rytmann in their ENS room. He himself reported the murder to the doctor in residence who contacted psychiatric institutions. Even before the police arrival, the doctor and the director of ENS decided to hospitalize him in the Sainte-Anne hospital and a psychiatric examination was conducted on him. Due to his mental state, Althusser was deemed to not understand the charges or the process to which he was to be submitted, so he remained at the hospital. The psychiatric assessment concluded he should not be criminally charged, based on article 64 of the French Penal Code, which stated that &quot;there is neither crime nor delict where the suspect was in a state of dementia at the time of the action&quot;. The report said Althusser killed Rytmann in the course of an acute crisis of melancholy, without even realizing it, and that the &quot;wife-murder by manual strangulation was committed without any additional violence, in the course of [an] iatrogenic hallucinatory episode complicated by melancholic depression.&quot; As a result, he lost his civil rights, entrusted to a representative of the law, and he was forbidden to sign any documents. In February 1981, the court ruled Althusser as having been mentally irresponsible when he committed the murder, therefore he could not be prosecuted and was not charged. Nonetheless, a warrant of confinement was subsequently issued by the Paris police prefecture; the Ministry of National Education mandated his retirement from the ENS; and the ENS requested his family and friends to clear out his apartment. In June, he was transferred to the L&#x27;Eau-Vive clinic at Soisy-sur-Seine.

The murder of Rytmann attracted much media attention, and there were several requests to treat Althusser as an ordinary criminal. The newspaper &quot;Minute&quot;, journalist Dominique Jamet and Minister of Justice Alain Peyrefitte were among those who accused Althusser of having &quot;privileges&quot; because of the fact he was Communist. From this point of view, Roudinesco wrote, Althusser was three times a criminal. First, the philosopher had legitimated the current of thought judged responsible for the Gulag; second, he praised the Chinese Cultural Revolution as an alternative to both capitalism and Stalinism; and finally because he had, it was said, corrupted the elite of French youth by introducing the cult of a criminal ideology into the heart of one of the best French institutions. Philosopher Pierre-André Taguieff went further on claiming Althusser taught his students to perceive crimes positively, as akin to a revolution. Five years after the murder, a critique by &quot;Le Monde&quot; Claude Sarraute would have a great impact on Althusser. She compared his case to the situation of Issei Sagawa, who killed and cannibalized a woman in France, but whose psychiatric diagnosis absolved him. Sarraute criticized the fact that, when prestigious names are involved, a lot is written about them but that little is written about the victim. Althusser&#x27;s friends persuaded him to speak in his defense, and the philosopher wrote an autobiography in 1985. He showed the result, &quot;L&#x27;avenir dure longtemps&quot;, to some of his friends and considered publishing it, but he never sent it to a publisher and locked it in his desk drawer. The book was only published posthumously in 1992.

Despite the critics, some of his friends, such as Guitton and Debray, defended Althusser, saying the murder was an act of love—as Althusser argued too. Rytmann had bouts of melancholy and self-medicated because of this. Guitton said, &quot;I sincerely think that he killed his wife out of love of her. It was a crime of mystical love&quot;. Debray compared it to an altruistic suicide: &quot;He suffocated her under a pillow to save her from the anguish that was suffocating him. A beautiful proof of love ... that one can save one&#x27;s skin while sacrificing oneself for the other, only to take upon oneself all the pain of living&quot;. In his autobiography, written to be the public explanation he could not provide in court, Althusser stated that &quot;she matter-of-factly asked me to kill her myself, and this word, unthinkable and intolerable in its horror, caused my whole body to tremble for a long time. It still makes me tremble... We were living shut up in the cloister of our hell, both of us.&quot;

That, of course, is what he said, but Rytmann&#x27;s point of view is unknowable. Quebecois author Suzanne Léveillée has written that Rytmann wanted to leave him. Another Quebecois author, Francis Dupuis-Déri, also confirms that idea in an article about how the media dealt handled the murder, and later in a book titled &quot;Althusser Assassin&quot;.

The crime seriously tarnished Althusser&#x27;s reputation. As Roudinesco wrote, from 1980, he lived his life as a &quot;specter, a dead man walking&quot;. Althusser was forced to live in various public and private clinics until 1983, when he became a voluntary patient. He was able to start an untitled manuscript during this time, in 1982; it was later published as &quot;The Underground Current of the Materialism of the Encounter&quot; (&quot;Le courant souterrain du matérialisme de la rencontre&quot;). From 1984 to 1986, he stayed at an apartment in the north of Paris, where he remained confined most of his time, but he also received visits from some friends, such as philosopher and theologian Stanislas Breton, who had also been a prisoner in the German stalags; from Guitton, who converted him into a &quot;mystic monk&quot; in Roudinesco&#x27;s words; and from Mexican philosopher Fernanda Navarro during six months, starting from the winter of 1984. Althusser and Navarro exchanged letters until February 1987, and he also wrote a preface in July 1986 for the resulting book, &quot;Filosofía y marxismo&quot;, a collection of her interviews with Althusser that was released in Mexico in 1988. These interviews and correspondence were collected and published in France in 1994 as &quot;Sur la philosophie&quot;. In this period he formulated his &quot;materialism of the encounter&quot; or &quot;aleatory materialism&quot;, talking to Breton and Navarro about it, that first appeared in &quot;Écrits philosophiques et politiques I&quot; (1994) and later in the 2006 Verso book &quot;Philosophy of the Encounter&quot;. In 1987, after Althusser underwent an emergency operation because of the obstruction of the esophagus, he developed a new clinical case of depression. First brought to the Soisy-sur-Seine clinic, he was transferred to the psychiatric institution MGEN in La Verrière. There, following a pneumonia contracted during the summer, he died of a heart attack on 22 October 1990.

==Personal life==
===Romantic life===
Althusser was such a homebody that biographer William S. Lewis affirmed, &quot;Althusser had known only home, school, and P.O.W. camp&quot; by the time he met his future wife. In contrast, when he first met Rytmann in 1946, she was a former member of the French resistance and a Communist activist. After fighting along with Jean Beaufret in the group &quot;Service Périclès&quot;, she joined the PCF. However, she was expelled from the party accused of being a double agent for the Gestapo, for &quot;Trotskyist deviation&quot; and &quot;crimes&quot;, which probably referred to the execution of former Nazi collaborators. Although high-ranking party officials instructed him to sever relations with Rytmann, Althusser tried to restore her reputation in the PCF for a long time by making inquiries into her wartime activities. Although he did not succeed in reinserting her into the party, his relationship with Rytmann nonetheless deepened during this period. Their relationship &quot;was traumatic from the outset, so Althusser claims&quot;, wrote Elliott. Among the reasons were his almost total inexperience with women and the fact she was eight years older than him.

His feelings toward her were contradictory from the very beginning; it is suggested that the strong emotional impact she caused in him led him to deep depression. Roudinesco wrote that, for Althusser, Rytmann represented the opposite of himself: she had been in the Resistance while he was remote from the anti-Nazi combat; she was a Jew who carried the stamp of the Holocaust, whereas he, despite his conversion to Marxism, never escaped the formative effect of Catholicism; she suffered under Stalinism at the very moment when he was joining the party; and, in opposition to his petit-bourgeois background, her childhood was not prosperous—at the age of 13 she became the sexual abuse victim of a family doctor who, in addition to the abuse, instructed her to give her terminally ill parents a dose of morphine. However, this story could have been invented by Althusser, who admitted to incorporating &quot;imagined memories&quot; into his &quot;traumabiography.&quot; According to Roudinesco, she embodied for Althusser his &quot;displaced conscience&quot;, &quot;pitiless superego&quot;, &quot;damned part&quot;, &quot;black animality&quot;.

Althusser considered that Rytmann gave him &quot;a world of solidarity and struggle, a world of reasoned action, ... a world of courage&quot;. According to him, they performed an indispensable maternal and paternal function for one another: &quot;She loved me as a mother loves a child... and at the same time like a good father in that she introduced me ... to the real world, that vast arena I had never been able to enter. ... Through her desire for me she also initiated me ... into my role as a man, into my masculinity. She loved me as a woman loves a man!&quot; Roudinesco argued that Rytmann represented for him &quot;the sublimated figure of his own hated mother to whom he remained attached all his life&quot;. In his autobiography, he wrote: &quot;If I was dazzled by Hélène&#x27;s love and the miraculous privilege of knowing her and having her in my life, I tried to give that back to her in my own way, intensely and, if I may put it this way, &quot;as a religious offering&quot;, as I had done for my mother.&quot;

Although Althusser was really in love with Rytmann, he also had affairs with other women. Roudinesco commented that &quot;unlike Hélène, the other women loved by Louis Althusser were generally of great physical beauty and sometimes exceptionally sensitive to intellectual dialogue&quot;. She gives as an example of the latter case a woman named Claire Z., with whom he had a long relationship until he was forty-two. They broke up when he met Franca Madonia, a philosopher, translator, and playwright from a well-off Italian bourgeois family from Romagna. Madonia was married to Mino, whose sister Giovanna was married to the Communist painter Leonardo Cremonini. Every summer the two families gathered in a residence in the village of Bertinoro, and, according to Roudinesco, &quot;It was in this magical setting ... that Louis Althusser fell in love with Franca, discovering through her everything he had missed in his own childhood and that he lacked in Paris: a real family, an art of living, a new manner of thinking, speaking, desiring&quot;. She influenced him to appreciate modern theatre (Luigi Pirandello, Bertolt Brecht, Samuel Beckett), and, Roudinesco wrote, also on his detachment of Stalinism and &quot;his finest texts (&quot;For Marx&quot; especially) but also his most important concepts&quot;. In her company in Italy in 1961, as Elliott affirmed, was also when he &quot;truly discovered&quot; Machiavelli. Between 1961 and 1965, they exchanged letters and telephone calls, and they also went on trips together, in which they talked about the current events, politics, and theory, as well as made confidences on the happiness and unhappiness of daily life. However, Madonia had an explosive reaction when Althusser tried to make her Rytmann&#x27;s friend, and seek to bring Mino into their meetings. They nevertheless continued to exchange letters until 1973; these were published in 1998 into an 800-page book &quot;Lettres à Franca&quot;.

===Mental condition===

Althusser underwent psychiatric hospitalisations throughout his life, the first time after receiving a diagnosis of schizophrenia. He suffered from bipolar disorder, and because of it he had frequent bouts of depression that started in 1938 and became regular after his five-year stay in German captivity. From the 1950s onward, he was under constant medical supervision, often undergoing, in Lewis&#x27; words, &quot;the most aggressive treatments post-war French psychiatry had to offer&quot;, which included electroconvulsive therapy, narco-analysis, and psychoanalysis. Althusser did not limit himself to prescribed medications and practised self-medication. The disease affected his academic productivity; in 1962, he began to write a book about Machiavelli during a depressive exacerbation but was interrupted by a three-months stay in a clinic. The main psychoanalyst he attended was the anti-Lacanian René Diatkine, starting from 1964, after he had a dream about killing his own sister. The sessions became more frequent in January 1965, and the real work of exploring the unconscious was launched in June. Soon Althusser recognized the positive side of non-Lacanian psychoanalysis; although sometimes tried to ridicule Diatkine giving him lessons in Lacanianism, by July 1966, he considered the treatment was producing &quot;spectacular results&quot;. In 1976, Althusser estimated that he had spent fifteen of the previous thirty years in hospitals and psychiatric clinics.

Althusser analysed the prerequisites of his illness with the help of psychoanalysis and found them in complex relationships with his family (he devoted to this topic half of the autobiography). Althusser believed that he did not have a genuine &quot;I&quot;, which was caused by the absence of real maternal love and the fact that his father was emotionally reserved and virtually absent for his son. Althusser deduced the family situation from the events before his birth, as told to him by his aunt: Lucienne Berger, his mother, was to marry his father&#x27;s brother, Louis Althusser, who died in World War I near Verdun, while Charles, his father, was engaged with Lucienne&#x27;s sister, Juliette. Both families followed the old custom of the levirate, which obliged an older, still unmarried, brother to wed the widow of a deceased younger brother. Lucienne then married Charles, and the son was named after the deceased Louis. In Althusser&#x27;s memoirs, this marriage was &quot;madness&quot;, not so much because of the tradition itself, but because of the excessive submission, as Charles was not forced to marry Lucienne since his younger brother had not yet married her. As a result, Althusser concluded, his mother did not love him, but loved the long-dead Louis. The philosopher described his mother as a &quot;castrating mother&quot; (a term from psychoanalysis), who, under the influence of her phobias, established a strict regime of social and sexual &quot;hygiene&quot; for Althusser and his sister Georgette. His &quot;feeling of fathomless solitude&quot; could only be mitigated by communicating with his mother&#x27;s parents who lived in Morvan. His relationship with his mother and the desire to deserve her love, in his memoirs, largely determined his adult life and career, including his admission to the ENS and his desire to become a &quot;well-known intellectual&quot;. According to his autobiography, ENS was for Althusser a kind of refuge of intellectual &quot;purity&quot; from the big &quot;dirty&quot; world that his mother was so afraid of.

The facts of his autobiography have been critically evaluated by researchers. According to its own editors, &quot;L&#x27;avenir dure longtemps&quot; is &quot;an inextricable tangle of &#x27;facts&#x27; and &#x27;phantasies&#x27;&quot;. His friend and biographer Yann Moulier-Boutang, after a careful analysis of the early period of Althusser&#x27;s life, concluded that the autobiography was &quot;a re-writing of a life through the prism of its wreckage&quot;. Moulier-Boutang believed that it was Rytmann who played a key role in creating a &quot;fatalistic&quot; account of the history of the Althusser family, largely shaping his vision in a 1964 letter. According to Elliott, the autobiography produces primarily an impression of &quot;destructiveness and self-destructiveness&quot;. Althusser, most likely, postdated the beginning of his depression to a later period (post-war), having not mentioned earlier manifestations of the disease in school and in the concentration camp. According to Moulier-Boutang, Althusser had a close psychological connection with Georgette from an early age, and although he did not often mention it in his autobiography, her &quot;nervous illness&quot; may have tracked his own. His sister also had depression, and despite their living separately from each other for almost their entire adult lives, their depression often coincided in time. Also, Althusser focused on describing family circumstances, not considering, for example, the influence of ENS on his personality. Moulier-Boutang connected the depression not only with events in his personal life, but also with political disappointments.

==Thought==
Althusser&#x27;s earlier works include the influential volume &quot;Reading Capital&quot; (1965), which collects the work of Althusser and his students in an intensive philosophical rereading of Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot;. The book reflects on the philosophical status of Marxist theory as a &quot;critique of political economy&quot;, and on its object. Althusser would later acknowledge that many of the innovations in this interpretation of Marx attempt to assimilate concepts derived from Baruch Spinoza into Marxism. The original English translation of this work includes only the essays of Althusser and Étienne Balibar, while the original French edition contains additional contributions from Jacques Rancière, Pierre Macherey and Roger Establet. A full translation was published in 2016.

Several of Althusser&#x27;s theoretical positions have remained influential in Marxist philosophy. His essay &quot;On the Materialist Dialectic&quot; proposes a great &quot;epistemological break&quot; between Marx&#x27;s early writings (1840–44) and his later, properly Marxist texts, borrowing a term from the philosopher of science Gaston Bachelard. His essay &quot;Marxism and Humanism&quot; is a strong statement of anti-humanism in Marxist theory, condemning ideas like &quot;human potential&quot; and &quot;species-being&quot;, which are often put forth by Marxists, as outgrowths of a bourgeois ideology of &quot;humanity&quot;. His essay &quot;Contradiction and Overdetermination&quot; borrows the concept of overdetermination from psychoanalysis, in order to replace the idea of &quot;contradiction&quot; with a more complex model of multiple causality in political situations (an idea closely related to Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s concept of cultural hegemony).

Althusser is also widely known as a theorist of ideology. His best-known essay, &quot;Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Toward an Investigation&quot;, establishes the concept of ideology. Althusser&#x27;s theory of ideology draws on Marx and Gramsci, but also on Freud&#x27;s and Lacan&#x27;s psychological concepts of the unconscious and mirror-phase respectively, and describes the structures and systems that enable the concept of self. For Althusser, these structures are both agents of repression and inevitable: it is impossible to escape ideology and avoid being subjected to it. On the other hand, the collection of essays from which &quot;Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses&quot; is drawn contains other essays which confirm that Althusser&#x27;s concept of ideology is broadly consistent with the classic Marxist theory of class struggle.

Althusser&#x27;s thought evolved during his lifetime. It has been the subject of argument and debate, especially within Marxism and specifically concerning his theory of knowledge (epistemology).

===Epistemological break===
Althusser argues that Marx&#x27;s thought has been fundamentally misunderstood and underestimated. He fiercely condemns various interpretations of Marx&#x27;s works—historicism, idealism and economism—on grounds that they fail to realize that with the &quot;science of history&quot;, historical materialism, Marx has constructed a revolutionary view of social change. Althusser believes these errors result from the notion that Marx&#x27;s entire body of work can be understood as a coherent whole. Rather, Marx&#x27;s thought contains a radical &quot;epistemological break&quot;. Although the works of the young Marx are bound by the categories of German philosophy and classical political economy, &quot;The German Ideology&quot; (written in 1845) makes a sudden and unprecedented departure. This break represents a shift in Marx&#x27;s work to a fundamentally different &quot;problematic&quot;, i.e., a different set of central propositions and questions posed, a different theoretical framework. Althusser believes that Marx himself did not fully comprehend the significance of his own work, and was able to express it only obliquely and tentatively. The shift can be revealed only by a careful and sensitive &quot;symptomatic reading&quot;. Thus, Althusser&#x27;s project is to help readers fully grasp the originality and power of Marx&#x27;s extraordinary theory, giving as much attention to what is not said as to the explicit. Althusser holds that Marx has discovered a &quot;continent of knowledge&quot;, History, analogous to the contributions of Thales to mathematics or Galileo to physics, in that the structure of his theory is unlike anything posited by his predecessors.

Althusser believes that Marx&#x27;s work is fundamentally incompatible with its antecedents because it is built on a groundbreaking epistemology (theory of knowledge) that rejects the distinction between subject and object. In opposition to empiricism, Althusser claims that Marx&#x27;s philosophy, dialectical materialism, counters the theory of knowledge as vision with a theory of knowledge as production. On the empiricist view, a knowing subject encounters a real object and uncovers its essence by means of abstraction. On the assumption that thought has a direct engagement with reality, or an unmediated vision of a &quot;real&quot; object, the empiricist believes that the truth of knowledge lies in the correspondence of a subject&#x27;s thought to an object that is external to thought itself. By contrast, Althusser claims to find latent in Marx&#x27;s work a view of knowledge as &quot;theoretical practice&quot;. For Althusser, theoretical practice takes place entirely within the realm of thought, working upon theoretical objects and never coming into direct contact with the real object that it aims to know. Knowledge is not discovered, but rather produced by way of three &quot;Generalities&quot;: (I) the &quot;raw material&quot; of pre-scientific ideas, abstractions and facts; (II) a conceptual framework (or &quot;problematic&quot;) brought to bear upon these; and (III) the finished product of a transformed theoretical entity, concrete knowledge. In this view, the validity of knowledge does not lie in its correspondence to something external to itself. Marx&#x27;s historical materialism is a science with its own internal methods of proof. It is therefore not governed by interests of society, class, ideology, or politics, and is distinct from the superstructure.

In addition to its unique epistemology, Marx&#x27;s theory is built on concepts—such as forces and relations of production—that have no counterpart in classical political economy. Even when existing terms are adopted—for example, the theory of surplus value, which combines David Ricardo&#x27;s concepts of rent, profit, and interest—their meaning and relation to other concepts in the theory is significantly different. However, more fundamental to Marx&#x27;s &quot;break&quot; is a rejection of &quot;homo economicus&quot;, or the idea held by the classical economists that the needs of individuals can be treated as a fact or &quot;given&quot; independent of any economic organization. For the classical economists, individual needs can serve as a premise for a theory explaining the character of a mode of production and as an independent starting point for a theory about society. Where classical political economy explains economic systems as a response to individual needs, Marx&#x27;s analysis accounts for a wider range of social phenomena in terms of the parts they play in a structured whole. Consequently, Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot; has greater explanatory power than does political economy because it provides both a model of the economy and a description of the structure and development of a whole society. In Althusser&#x27;s view, Marx does not merely argue that human needs are largely created by their social environment and thus vary with time and place; rather, he abandons the very idea that there can be a theory about what people are like that is prior to any theory about how they come to be that way.

Although Althusser insists that there was an epistemological break, he later states that its occurrence around 1845 is not clearly defined, as traces of humanism, historicism, and Hegelianism are found in &quot;Capital&quot;. He claims that only Marx&#x27;s &quot;Critique of the Gotha Programme&quot; and some marginal notes on a book by Adolph Wagner are fully free from humanist ideology. In line with this, Althusser replaces his earlier definition of Marx&#x27;s philosophy as the &quot;theory of theoretical practice&quot; with a new belief in &quot;politics in the field of history&quot; and &quot;class struggle in theory&quot;. Althusser considers the epistemological break to be a &quot;process&quot; instead of a clearly defined &quot;event&quot; — the product of incessant struggle against ideology. Thus, the distinction between ideology and science or philosophy is not assured once and for all by the epistemological break.

===Practices===
Because of Marx&#x27;s belief that the individual is a product of society, Althusser holds that it is pointless to try to build a social theory on a prior conception of the individual. The subject of observation is not individual human elements, but rather &quot;structure&quot;. As he sees it, Marx does not explain society by appealing to the properties of individual persons—their beliefs, desires, preferences, and judgements. Rather, Marx defines society as a set of fixed &quot;practices&quot;. Individuals are not actors who make their own history, but are instead the &quot;supports&quot; () of these practices.

Althusser uses this analysis to defend Marx&#x27;s historical materialism against the charge that it crudely posits a base (economic level) and superstructure (culture/politics) &quot;rising upon it&quot; and then attempts to explain all aspects of the superstructure by appealing to features of the (economic) base (the well known architectural metaphor). For Althusser, it is a mistake to attribute this economic determinist view to Marx. Just as Althusser criticises the idea that a social theory can be founded on a historical conception of human needs, so does he reject the idea that economic practice can be used in isolation to explain other aspects of society. Althusser believes that the base and the superstructure are interdependent, although he keeps to the classic Marxist materialist understanding of the determination of the base &quot;in the last instance&quot; (albeit with some extension and revision). The advantage of practices over human individuals as a starting point is that although each practice is only a part of a complex whole of society, a practice is a whole in itself in that it consists of a number of different kinds of parts. Economic practice, for example, contains raw materials, tools, individual persons, etc., all united in a process of production.

Althusser conceives of society as an interconnected collection of these wholes: economic practice, ideological practice, and politico-legal practice. Although each practice has a degree of relative autonomy, together they make up one complex, structured whole (social formation). In his view, all practices are dependent on each other. For example, among the relations of production of capitalist societies are the buying and selling of labour power by capitalists and workers respectively. These relations are part of economic practice, but can only exist within the context of a legal system which establishes individual agents as buyers and sellers. Furthermore, the arrangement must be maintained by political and ideological means. From this it can be seen that aspects of economic practice depend on the superstructure and vice versa. For him this was the moment of &quot;reproduction&quot; and constituted the important role of the superstructure.

===Contradiction and overdetermination===
An analysis understood in terms of interdependent practices helps people to conceive of how society is organized, but also permits them to comprehend social change and thus provides a theory of history. Althusser explains the reproduction of the relations of production by reference to aspects of ideological and political practice; conversely, the emergence of new production relations can be explained by the failure of these mechanisms. Marx&#x27;s theory seems to posit a system in which an imbalance in two parts could lead to compensatory adjustments at other levels, or sometimes to a major reorganization of the whole. To develop this idea, Althusser relies on the concepts of contradiction and non-contradiction, which he claims are illuminated by their relation to a complex structured whole. Practices are contradictory when they &quot;grate&quot; on one another and non-contradictory when they support one another. Althusser elaborates on these concepts by reference to Lenin&#x27;s analysis of the Russian Revolution of 1917.

Lenin posited that despite widespread discontent throughout Europe in the early 20th century, Russia was the country in which revolution occurred because it contained all the contradictions possible within a single state at the time. In his words, it was the &quot;weakest link in a chain of imperialist states&quot;. He explained the revolution in relation to two groups of circumstances: firstly, the existence within Russia of large-scale exploitation in cities, mining districts, etc., a disparity between urban industrialization and medieval conditions in the countryside, and a lack of unity amongst the ruling class; secondly, a foreign policy which played into the hands of revolutionaries, such as the elites who had been exiled by the Tsar and had become sophisticated socialists.

For Althusser, this example reinforces his claim that Marx&#x27;s explanation of social change is more complex than the result of a single contradiction between the forces and the relations of production. The differences between events in Russia and Western Europe highlight that a contradiction between forces and relations of production may be necessary, but not sufficient, to bring about revolution. The circumstances that produced revolution in Russia were heterogeneous, and cannot be seen to be aspects of one large contradiction. Each was a contradiction within a particular social totality. From this, Althusser concludes that Marx&#x27;s concept of contradiction is inseparable from the concept of a complex structured social whole. To emphasize that changes in social structures relate to numerous contradictions, Althusser describes these changes as &quot;overdetermined&quot;, using a term taken from Sigmund Freud. This interpretation allows people to account for the way in which many different circumstances may play a part in the course of events, and how these circumstances may combine to produce unexpected social changes or &quot;ruptures&quot;.

However, Althusser does not mean to say that the events that determine social changes all have the same causal status. While a part of a complex whole, economic practice is a &quot;structure in dominance&quot;: it plays a major part in determining the relations between other spheres, and has more effect on them than they have on it. The most prominent aspect of society (the religious aspect in feudal formations and the economic aspect in capitalist formations) is called the &quot;dominant instance&quot;, and is in turn determined &quot;in the last instance&quot; by the economy. For Althusser, the economic practice of a society determines which other formation of that society dominates the society as a whole.

Althusser&#x27;s understanding of contradiction in terms of the dialectic attempts to rid Marxism of the influence and vestiges of Hegelian (idealist) dialectics, and is a component part of his general anti-humanist position. In his reading, the Marxist understanding of social totality is not to be confused with the Hegelian. Where Hegel sees the different features of each historical epoch – its art, politics, religion, etc. – as expressions of a single essence, Althusser believes each social formation to be &quot;decentred&quot;, i.e., that it cannot be reduced or simplified to a unique central point.

===Ideological state apparatuses===

Because Althusser held that a person&#x27;s desires, choices, intentions, preferences, judgements, and so forth are the effects of social practices, he believed it necessary to conceive of how society makes the individual in its own image. Within capitalist societies, the human individual is generally regarded as a subject—a self-conscious, &quot;responsible&quot; agent whose actions can be explained by their beliefs and thoughts. For Althusser, a person&#x27;s capacity to perceive themselves in this way is not innate. Rather, it is acquired within the structure of established social practices, which impose on individuals the role (&quot;forme&quot;) of a subject. Social practices both determine the characteristics of the individual and give them an idea of the range of properties they can have, and of the limits of each individual. Althusser argues that many roles and activities are acquired and learned by social practice: for example, the production of steelworkers is a part of economic practice, while the production of lawyers is part of politico-legal practice. However, other characteristics of individuals, such as their beliefs about the good life or their metaphysical reflections on the nature of the self, do not easily fit into these categories.

In Althusser&#x27;s view, values, desires, and preferences are inculcated in by ideological practice, the sphere which has the defining property of constituting individuals as subjects. Ideological practice consists of an assortment of institutions called &quot;ideological state apparatuses&quot; (ISAs), which include the family, the media, religious organizations, and most importantly in capitalist societies, the education system, as well as the received ideas that they propagate. No single ISA produces in people the belief of self-conscious agents. Instead, this belief is derived from learning what it is to be a daughter, a schoolchild, black, a steelworker, a councillor, and so forth.

Despite its many institutional forms, the function and structure of ideology is unchanging and present throughout history; as Althusser states, &quot;ideology has no history&quot;. All ideologies constitute a subject, even though he or she may differ according to each particular ideology. Memorably, Althusser illustrates this with the concept of &quot;hailing&quot; or &quot;interpellation&quot;. He compares ideology to a policeman shouting &quot;Hey you there!&quot; toward a person walking on the street. Upon hearing this call, the person responds by turning around and in doing so, is transformed into a subject. The person being hailed recognizes themselves as the subject of the hail, and knows to respond. Althusser calls this recognition a &quot;mis-recognition&quot; (&quot;méconnaissance&quot;), because it works retroactively: a material individual is always already an ideological subject, even before he or she is born. The &quot;transformation&quot; of an individual into a subject has always already happened; Althusser here acknowledges a debt to Spinoza&#x27;s theory of immanence.

To highlight this, Althusser offers the example of Christian religious ideology, embodied in the Voice of God, instructing a person on what their place in the world is and what he must do to be reconciled with Christ. From this, Althusser draws the point that in order for that person to identify as a Christian, he must first already be a subject; that is, by responding to God&#x27;s call and following His rules, he affirms himself as a free agent, the author of the acts for which he assumes responsibility. People cannot recognize themselves outside ideology, and in fact, their very actions reach out to this overarching structure. Althusser&#x27;s theory draws heavily from Jacques Lacan and his concept of the Mirror Stage—people acquire their identities by seeing themselves mirrored in ideologies.

=== Aleatory materialism ===
In various short papers drafted from 1982 to 1986 and published posthumously, Althusser is critical of the relation of Marxist science to the philosophy of dialectical materialism and materialist philosophy in general. Althusser rejects dialectical materialism and introduces a new concept: the philosophy of the encounter, renamed aleatory materialism in 1986. To develop this idea, Althusser holds that there exists an “underground” or barely recognized philosophical current of aleatory Materialism, articulated by Marx, Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius, Machiavelli, Spinoza, Hobbes, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and Derrida.

He argues that it was an idealist and teleological mistake to think that there are general laws of history and that social relations are determined in the same manner as physical relations. Emphasising the role of contingency in history over laws of development he states that reconstructed historical materialism has as its object complex historical singularities or &quot;conjunctures&quot;, The &quot;conjuncture&quot; is the pivotal point, where political practice may intervene, and aleatory materialism is a materialist philosophy to understand this conjuncture.

==Reception and influence==
While Althusser&#x27;s writings were born of an intervention against reformist and ecumenical tendencies within Marxist theory, the eclecticism of his influences reflected a move away from the intellectual isolation of the Stalin era. He drew as much from pre-Marxist systems of thought and contemporary schools such as structuralism, philosophy of science and psychoanalysis as he did from thinkers in the Marxist tradition. Furthermore, his thought was symptomatic of Marxism&#x27;s growing academic respectability, and of a push towards emphasizing Marx&#x27;s legacy as a philosopher rather than only as an economist or sociologist. Tony Judt saw this as a criticism of Althusser&#x27;s work, saying he removed Marxism &quot;altogether from the realm of history, politics and experience, and thereby ... render[ed] it invulnerable to any criticism of the empirical sort.&quot;

Althusser has had broad influence in the areas of Marxist philosophy and post-structuralism: interpellation has been popularized and adapted by the feminist philosopher and critic Judith Butler, and elaborated further by Göran Therborn; the concept of ideological state apparatuses has been of interest to Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek; the attempt to view history as a process without a subject garnered sympathy from Jacques Derrida; historical materialism was defended as a coherent doctrine from the standpoint of analytic philosophy by G. A. Cohen; the interest in structure and agency sparked by Althusser was to play a role in sociologist Anthony Giddens&#x27;s theory of structuration.

Althusser&#x27;s influence is also seen in the work of economists Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick, who have interpreted that Marx&#x27;s mature works hold a conception of class different from the normally understood ones. For them, in Marx class refers not to a group of people (for example, those that own the means of production versus those that do not), but to a process involving the production, appropriation, and distribution of surplus labour. Their emphasis on class as a process is consistent with their reading and use of Althusser&#x27;s concept of overdetermination in terms of understanding agents and objects as the site of multiple determinations.

Althusser&#x27;s work has also been criticized from a number of angles. In a 1971 paper for &quot;Socialist Register&quot;, Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski undertook a detailed critique of structural Marxism, arguing that the concept was seriously flawed on three main points:

Kołakowski further argued that, despite Althusser&#x27;s &#x27;verbal claims to &quot;scientificity&quot;&#x27;, is &quot;himself&quot; &quot;building a gratuitous ideological project&quot;. In 1980, sociologist Axel van den Berg described Kołakowski&#x27;s critique as &quot;devastating&quot;, proving that &quot;Althusser retains the orthodox radical rhetoric by simply severing all connections with verifiable facts&quot;.

G. A. Cohen, in his essay &#x27;Complete Bullshit&#x27;, has cited the &#x27;Althusserian school&#x27; as an example of &#x27;bullshit&#x27; and a factor in his co-founding the &#x27;Non-Bullshit Marxism Group&#x27;. He says that &#x27;the ideas that the Althusserians generated, for example, of the interpellation of the subject, or of contradiction and overdetermination, possessed a surface allure, but it often seemed impossible to determine whether or not the theses in which those ideas figured were true, and, at other times, those theses seemed capable of just two interpretations: on one of them they were true but uninteresting, and, on the other, they were interesting, but quite obviously false&#x27;.

Althusser was vehemently attacked by British Marxist historian E. P. Thompson in his book &quot;The Poverty of Theory&quot;. Thompson claimed that Althusserianism was Stalinism reduced to the paradigm of a theory. Where the Soviet doctrines that existed during the lifetime of the dictator lacked systematisation, Althusser&#x27;s theory gave Stalinism &quot;its true, rigorous and totally coherent expression&quot;. As such, Thompson called for &quot;unrelenting intellectual war&quot; against the Marxism of Althusser.

==Legacy==
Since his death, the reassessment of Althusser&#x27;s work and influence has been ongoing. The first wave of retrospective critiques and interventions (&quot;drawing up a balance sheet&quot;) began outside of Althusser&#x27;s own country, France, because, as Étienne Balibar pointed out in 1988, &quot;there is an absolute taboo now suppressing the name of this man and the meaning of his writings.&quot; Balibar&#x27;s remarks were made at the &quot;Althusserian Legacy&quot; Conference organized at Stony Brook University by Michael Sprinker. The proceedings of this conference were published in September 1992 as the &quot;Althusserian Legacy&quot; and included contributions from Balibar, Alex Callinicos, Michele Barrett, Alain Lipietz, Warren Montag, and Gregory Elliott, among others. It also included an obituary and an extensive interview with Derrida.

Eventually, a colloquium was organized in France at the University of Paris VIII by Sylvain Lazarus on 27 May 1992. The general title was &quot;Politique et philosophie dans l&#x27;oeuvre de Louis Althusser&quot;, the proceedings of which were published in 1993.

In retrospect, Althusser&#x27;s continuing influence can be seen through his students. A dramatic example of this points to the editors and contributors of the 1960s journal &quot;Cahiers pour l&#x27;Analyse&quot;: &quot;In many ways, the &#x27;Cahiers&#x27; can be read as the critical development of Althusser&#x27;s own intellectual itinerary when it was at its most robust.&quot; This influence continues to guide much philosophical work, as many of these same students became eminent intellectuals in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s: Alain Badiou, Étienne Balibar and Jacques Rancière in philosophy, Pierre Macherey in literary criticism and Nicos Poulantzas in sociology. The prominent Guevarist Régis Debray also studied under Althusser, as did the aforementioned Derrida (with whom he at one time shared an office at the ENS), noted philosopher Michel Foucault, and the pre-eminent Lacanian psychoanalyst Jacques-Alain Miller.

Badiou has lectured and spoken on Althusser on several occasions in France, Brazil, and Austria since Althusser&#x27;s death. Badiou has written many studies, including &quot;Althusser: Subjectivity without a Subject&quot;, published in his book &quot;Metapolitics&quot; in 2005. Most recently, Althusser&#x27;s work has been given prominence again through the interventions of Warren Montag and his circle; see for example the special issue of &quot;borderlands e-journal&quot; edited by David McInerney (&quot;Althusser &amp; Us&quot;) and &quot;Décalages: An Althusser Studies Journal&quot;, edited by Montag. (See &quot;External links&quot; below for access to both of these journals.)

In 2011 Althusser continued to spark controversy and debate with the publication in August of that year of Jacques Rancière&#x27;s first book, &quot;Althusser&#x27;s Lesson&quot; (1974). It marked the first time this groundbreaking work was to appear in its entirety in an English translation. In 2014, &quot;On the Reproduction of Capitalism&quot; was published, which is an English translation of the full text of the work from which the ISAs text was drawn.

The publication of Althusser&#x27;s posthumous memoir cast some doubt on his own scholarly practices. For example, although he owned thousands of books, Althusser revealed that he knew very little about Kant, Spinoza, and Hegel. While he was familiar with Marx&#x27;s early works, he had not read &quot;Capital&quot; when he wrote his own most important Marxist texts. Additionally, Althusser had &quot;contrived to impress his first teacher, the Catholic theologian Jean Guitton, with a paper whose guiding principles he had simply filched from Guitton&#x27;s own corrections of a fellow student&#x27;s essay,&quot; and &quot;he concocted fake quotations in the thesis he wrote for another major contemporary philosopher, Gaston Bachelard.&quot;

<text>Jacob Benignus [[Winsløw family|Winsløw]], also known as Jacques-Bénigne Winslow (17 April 1669 – 3 April 1760), was a Danish-born French anatomist.

== Life ==
Winsløw was born in Odense, Denmark. Later he became a pupil and successor of Guichard Joseph Duverney, as well as a convert to Catholicism, naturalized in France, and finally became professor of anatomy at the Jardin du Roi in Paris. 

He greatly admired Bishop Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, the famous preacher who had been instrumental in his conversion, and changed his first name to that of Bossuet.

Winsløw died in Paris.

== Work ==
His main work, with many translations, was &quot;Exposition anatomique de la structure du corps humain&quot;, published in 1732. His exposition of the structure of the human body is distinguished for being not only the first treatise of descriptive anatomy, divested of physiological details and hypothetical explanations foreign to the subject, but for being a close description derived from actual objects, without reference to the writings of previous anatomists. About the same time William Cheselden in London, the first Alexander Monro in Edinburgh, and Bernhard Siegfried Albinus in Leiden, contributed by their several treatises to render anatomy still more precise as a descriptive science. The &quot;Osteographia&quot; of the first-mentioned was of much use in directing attention to the study of the skeleton and the morbid changes to which it is liable.

In 1742, he addressed the question of the sure signs of death and premature burial (burial alive), in his thesis &quot;The uncertainty of the signs of death, and the danger of precipitate interments and dissections&quot;. (in French : &quot;Dissertation sur l&#x27;incertitude des signes de la mort, et des enterremens &amp; embaumemens précipités&quot;).
The omental foramen, which he first described, is still known under the alternative name of &quot;Winslow&#x27;s foramen&quot;.

Jacob Winslow is credited with first documenting the existence of the foramen spinosum.

<text>Well temperament (also good temperament, circular or circulating temperament) is a type of tempered tuning described in 20th-century music theory. The term is modeled on the German word &quot;wohltemperiert&quot;. This word also appears in the title of J. S. Bach&#x27;s famous composition &quot;Das wohltemperierte Klavier&quot;, &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;.

==Origins==

As used in the 17th century, the term &quot;well tempered&quot; meant that the twelve notes per octave of the standard keyboard were tuned in such a way that it was possible to play music in all major or minor keys that were commonly in use, without sounding perceptibly out of tune.

One of the first attestations of the concept of &quot;well tempered&quot; is found in a treatise in German by the music theorist Andreas Werckmeister. In the subtitle of his &quot;Orgelprobe&quot;, from 1681, he writes:
The words and were subsequently combined into . A modern definition of &quot;well temperament&quot;, from Herbert Kelletat, is given below:

In most tuning systems used before 1700, one or more intervals on the twelve-note keyboard were so far from any pure interval that they were unusable in harmony and were called a &quot;wolf interval&quot;. Until about 1650 the most common keyboard temperament was quarter-comma meantone, in which the fifths were narrowed so as to maximize the number of pure major thirds. Syntonic commas were distributed across most sequences of four narrowed fifths, with one remaining correction accommodated usually in the diminished sixth G to E, which expands to almost a justly tuned minor sixth. It is this interval that is usually called the &quot;wolf&quot;, because it is so far from consonance.

The wolf was not a problem if music was played in a small number of keys (or to be more precise, transposed modes) with few accidentals, but it prevented players from transposing and modulating freely. Some instrument-makers sought to remedy the problem by introducing more than twelve notes per octave, producing enharmonic keyboards which could provide, for example, a D and an E with different pitches so that the thirds B–D and E–G could both be euphonious. These solutions could include split keys and multiple manuals; one such solution, the archicembalo, was mentioned by Nicola Vicentino in 1555.

However, Werckmeister realised that split keys, or &quot;subsemitonia&quot; as he called them, were unnecessary, and even counterproductive in music with chromatic progressions and extensive modulations. He described a series of tunings where enharmonic notes had the same pitch: in other words, the same note was used as both (say) E and D, thereby &quot;bringing the keyboard into the form of a circle&quot;. This refers to the fact that the notes or keys may be arranged in a circle of fifths and it is possible to modulate from one key to another without restriction. This is also the source of the terms &quot;circular temperament&quot; or &quot;circulating temperament&quot;.

Although equal temperament is discussed by Werckmeister in his treatises, it is distinguished from non-equal well temperaments.

==Forms==
The term &quot;well temperament&quot; or &quot;good temperament&quot; usually means some sort of irregular temperament in which the tempered fifths are of different sizes but no key has very impure intervals. Historical irregular temperaments usually have the narrowest fifths between the diatonic notes (&quot;naturals&quot;) producing purer thirds, and wider fifths among the chromatic notes (&quot;sharps and flats&quot;). Each key thus has a slightly different pattern of interval ratios, and hence different keys have distinct characters. Such &quot;key-color&quot; was an essential part of much 18th- and 19th-century music and was described in treatises of the period.

One of the earliest recorded circular temperaments was described by the organist Arnolt Schlick in the early 16th century. However, &quot;well temperaments&quot; did not become widely used until the Baroque period. They persisted through the Classical period, and even survived into the second half of 19th century in some areas, for example in Italy.

There are many well temperament schemes, some nearer meantone temperament, others nearer 12-tone equal temperament. Although such tunings have no wolf fifth, keys with many sharps or flats still do not sound very pure, due to their thirds. This can create contrast between chords in which vibrations are concordant with others where the vibrations are not harmonically related and thus beat.

Some modern theorists such as Owen Jorgensen have sought to define &quot;well temperament&quot; more narrowly to exclude fifths wider than pure, which rules out many such schemes.

Some well-known well temperaments go by the following names:

* Werckmeister (invented by Andreas Werckmeister)
* French Temperament ordinaire
* Kirnberger
* Kellner
* Vallotti (invented by Francesco Antonio Vallotti)
* Young

Some temperament schemes feature numbers of perfect, pure fifths and these give enhanced harmonic resonance to instruments and music on which they are played so that music moves into and out of focus between keys as vibrations lock together or not. Werckmeister features 8 perfect fifths, Kellner 7 and Vallotti 6. Alternatively, &quot;Reverse Lehman-Bach 14,&quot; a system by Kees Van Den Doel, features only 3 pure perfect fifths in exchange for optimal major thirds, with none wider than a Pythagorean Third.

The contemporary composer Douglas Leedy has written several works for harpsichord or organ in which the use of a well temperament is required.

<doc id="76916" wikidata="Q410431" url="?curid=76916" title="Methyl isocyanate">
<text>Methyl isocyanate (MIC) is an organic compound with the molecular formula CH3NCO. Synonyms are isocyanatomethane and methyl carbylamine. Methyl isocyanate is an intermediate chemical in the production of carbamate pesticides and Haffmann Bromamide Degradation (such as carbaryl, carbofuran, methomyl, and aldicarb). It has also been used in the production of rubbers and adhesives. As an extremely toxic and irritating compound, it is very hazardous to human health. MIC was the principal toxicant involved in the Bhopal gas disaster, which short-term killed 4,000–8,000 people and caused permanent injury and premature deaths to approximately 15,000-20,000. It is also a very potent lachrymatory agent.

== Physical properties ==
Methyl isocyanate is a colorless, poisonous, lachrymatory (tearing agent), flammable liquid. It is soluble in water to 6–10 parts per 100 parts, but it also reacts with water (see Reactions below).

It has a refractive index of 1.363 with a wavelength of 589 nm at a temperature of 20 °C 

== Manufacture ==
Methyl isocyanate is usually manufactured by the reaction of monomethylamine and phosgene. For large-scale production it is advantageous to combine these reactants at higher temperature in the gas phase. A mixture of methyl isocyanate and two moles of hydrogen chloride is formed, but N-methylcarbamoyl chloride (MCC) forms as the mixture is condensed, leaving one mole of hydrogen chloride as a gas.
The methyl isocyanate is obtained by treating the MCC with a tertiary amine, such as &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylaniline, or with pyridine, or by separating it by using distillation techniques.
Methyl isocyanate is also manufactured from &quot;N&quot;-methylformamide and air. In the latter process, it is immediately consumed in a closed-loop process to make methomyl. Other manufacturing methods have been reported.

== Reactions ==
Methyl isocyanate reacts readily with many substances that contain N-H or O-H groups. With water, it forms 1,3-dimethylurea and carbon dioxide with the evolution of heat (1358.5 joules, or 325 calories, per gram of MIC): It is relatively slow to react at below 68 °F, but will increase its rate with elevated temperatures or in the presence of acid or base.
At 25 °C, in excess water, half of the MIC is consumed in 9 min.; if the heat is not efficiently removed from the reacting mixture, the rate of the reaction will increase and rapidly cause the MIC to boil. Such a reaction triggered the Bhopal disaster after a large amount of water was introduced to a MIC storage tank. The consequence of the out of control exothermic process was a runaway reaction and the direct release of 42 tons of MIC to the atmosphere.

If MIC is in excess, 1,3,5-trimethylbiuret is formed along with carbon dioxide. Alcohols and phenols, which contain an O-H group, react slowly with MIC, but the reaction can be catalyzed by trialkylamines or dialkyltin dicarboxylate. Oximes, hydroxylamines, and enols also react with MIC to form methylcarbamates. These reactions produce the products described below (Uses).
Ammonia, primary, and secondary amines rapidly react with MIC to form substituted ureas. Other N-H compounds, such as amides and ureas, react much more slowly with MIC.

It also reacts with itself to form a trimer or higher-molecular-weight polymers. In the presence of catalysts, MIC reacts with itself to form a solid trimer, trimethyl isocyanurate, or a higher-molecular-weight polymer:
Sodium methoxide, triethyl phosphine, ferric chloride and certain other metal compounds catalyze the formation of the MIC-trimer, while the high-molecular-weight polymer formation is catalyzed by certain trialkylamines. Since the formation of the MIC trimer is exothermic (1246 joules, or 298 calories, per gram of MIC), the reaction can lead to violent boiling of the MIC. The high-molecular-weight polymer hydrolyzes in hot water to form the trimethyl isocyanurate. Since catalytic metal salts can be formed from impurities in commercial grade MIC and steel, this product must not be stored in steel drums or tanks.

== Toxicity ==
Methyl isocyanate is extremely toxic. There is no known antidote. The threshold limit value set by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists is 0.02 ppm. MIC is toxic by inhalation, ingestion and contact in quantities as low as 0.4 ppm. Exposure symptoms include coughing, chest pain, dyspnea, asthma, irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, as well as skin damage. Higher levels of exposure, over 21 ppm, can result in pulmonary or lung edema, emphysema and hemorrhages, bronchial pneumonia and death. Although the odor of methyl isocyanate cannot be detected at 5 ppm by most people, its potent lachrymal properties provide an excellent warning of its presence (at a concentration of 2–4 parts per million (ppm) subjected to eyes are irritated, while at 21 ppm, subjects could not tolerate the presence of methyl isocyanate in air). The irritant effects of methyl isocyanate are mediated by the irritant and tear gas receptor TRPA1 in pain-sensing nerve endings in the eye. 

Proper care must be taken to store methyl isocyanate because of its ease of exothermically polymerizing (see Reactions) and its similar sensitivity to water. Only stainless steel or glass containers may be safely used; the MIC must be stored at temperatures below and preferably at .

The toxic effect of the compound was apparent in the 1984 Bhopal disaster, when around of methyl isocyanate and other gases were released from the underground reservoirs of the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) factory, over a populated area on 3 December 1984, killing about 3,500 people immediately, 8,000 people in the first 48 hours and 15,000 more over the next several years. 200,000 people had lasting health effects from the disaster.

During structural fires, natural materials can contribute to releasing isocyanates including methyl isocyanate.

=== Mechanism of action ===
Until recent decades, the mechanism of methyl isocyanate toxicity in humans was largely unknown or unclear. Methyl isocyanate and other isocyanates are electrophiles and are currently thought to cause toxicity by the alkylation of biomolecules. The mechanism of methyl isocyanate was previously suspected to be the carbamylation of hemoglobin, thus interfering with its oxygen-binding capability and causing hypoxia. However, experiments showed that when rats and guinea pigs were exposed to methyl isocyanate at concentrations above the median lethal concentration (LC50, the concentration sufficient to kill 50% of the tested population), only 2% of hemoglobin molecules were carbamylated, suggesting that this is probably not the mechanism of toxicity.

== Extraterrestrial occurrence ==

On 30 July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the &quot;Philae&quot; lander on comet 67/P surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde.

In 2017, two teams of astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) interferometer made of 66 radio telescopes in the Atacama Desert (northern Chile) have discovered the presence of MIC around young Sun-like stars.

MIC is considered a prebiotic molecule as explained by the discoverers of the ALMA findings in IRAS 16293-2422, a multiple system of very young stars: &quot;This family of organic molecules is involved in the synthesis of peptides and amino acids, which, in the form of proteins, are the biological basis for life as we know it&quot;.

<text>La Défense () is a major business district in France&#x27;s Paris metropolitan area, west of the city limits. It is located in Île-de-France region&#x27;s department of Hauts-de-Seine in the communes of Courbevoie, La Garenne-Colombes, Nanterre, and Puteaux.

La Défense is Europe&#x27;s largest purpose-built business district, covering , for 180,000 daily workers, with 72 glass and steel buildings (of which 20 are completed skyscrapers, out of 24 in the Paris region), and of office space. Around its Grande Arche and esplanade (&quot;le Parvis&quot;), La Défense contains many of the Paris urban area&#x27;s tallest high-rises. Westfield Les Quatre Temps, a large shopping mall in La Défense, has 220 stores, 48 restaurants and a 24-screen movie theatre.

Paris La Défense Arena, the largest indoor arena in Europe, was inaugurated in 2017.

The district is located at the westernmost extremity of the &quot;Axe historique&quot; (&quot;historical axis&quot;) of Paris, which starts at the Louvre in Central Paris and continues along the Champs-Élysées, well beyond the Arc de Triomphe along the Avenue de la Grande Armée before culminating at La Défense. The district is centred in an orbital motorway straddling the Hauts-de-Seine department communes of Courbevoie, La Garenne-Colombes, Nanterre and Puteaux. La Défense is primarily a business district and hosts a population of 50,000 permanent residents and 75,000 students. La Défense is also visited by 8,000,000 tourists each year and houses an open-air museum.

==History==

La Défense is named after the statue &quot;La Défense de Paris&quot; by Louis-Ernest Barrias, which was erected in 1883 to commemorate the soldiers who had defended Paris during the Franco-Prussian War.

In September 1958, the (EPAD) buildings (of which the Esso Tower was the first) were constructed and began to slowly replace the city&#x27;s factories, shanties, and even a few farms. The Centre of New Industries and Technologies (CNIT) was built and first used in 1958. These &quot;first generation&quot; skyscrapers were all very similar in appearance, limited to a height of . In 1966, the Nobel Tower was the first office skyscraper built in the area. In 1970, the RER line A railway was opened from La Défense to Étoile. In 1974, a contract for a Défense-Cergy high-speed hovercraft train was signed and soon abandoned.

In the early 1970s, in response to great demand, a second generation of buildings began to appear, but the economic crisis in 1973 nearly halted all construction in the area. A third generation of towers began to appear in the early 1980s. The biggest shopping centre in Europe (at the time), the &quot;Quatre Temps&quot;, was created in 1981. In 1982, the EPAD launched the &quot;Tête Défense&quot; competition to find a monument to complete the &quot;Axe historique&quot;, which eventually led to the construction of Grande Arche at the west end of the quarter. During the same period, hotels were constructed, the CNIT was restructured, and in 1992, Line 1 of the Paris Métro was extended to La Défense, which made the area readily accessible to more of the city.

On Bastille Day 1990, French electronic composer Jean-Michel Jarre staged an ambitious concert at the site, using the Grande Arche and three of the area&#x27;s towers as projection screens, and building a pyramidal stage above the road. The free concert, titled Paris la Défense, attracted two million spectators, stretching all the way back to the Arc de Triomphe. This beat Jarre&#x27;s own previous world record for the largest attendance for a musical concert. After Jean Michel Jarre, German DJ Sash! and the singer La Trec set the video clip for their song &quot;Stay&quot; at La Défense in 1997.

After a stagnation in new development in the mid-1990s, La Défense is once again expanding and is now the largest purpose-built business district in Europe.

Major corporations headquartered at La Défense include Neuf Cegetel, Société Générale, TotalEnergies, Aventis, Areva, and Arcelor. The tallest skyscraper, the Tour First belongs to AXA, constructed in 1974. It is high, has 50 floors, and is the highest inhabited building in the Paris area. This title was previously held by the Tour Montparnasse, which was the tallest inhabited building until the Tour First was renovated between 2007 and 2011, bringing it to its current height from a previous ; the tallest structure in Paris is the Eiffel Tower.

On 9 September 2008, La Défense celebrated its 50th anniversary with a huge fireworks display.

In December 2005, Bernard Bled, CEO and chairman of EPAD (La Defense Management and Development Office) announced an ambitious nine-year development plan called &quot;La Defense 2006–2015&quot;. This important modernisation plan has to give a new dimension to the district and focuses on four main axes: regenerate outdated skyscrapers, allow new buildings, improve the balance between offices and residential housing, and make the transport of local employees from their homes to La Défense easier. There are three aims: building of offices within demolition/rebuilding projects, building of offices within new projects, and building of housing.

In July 2006, the government confirmed this plan, which has to be carried out around 2015. It is justified by the strong estate pressure, which plays in favour of building new skyscrapers near Paris. Those constructions have the advantage of being more economical than small buildings. But it will have to overcome some difficulties: the French economy faced a short-term slowdown; the government is trying to balance tertiary sector employment in the whole region again, because today La Défense concentrates a major part of those jobs; and traffic is already saturated in the district, while it would need huge investments to extend transport infrastructures.

It launched high-profile international competitions and/or construction approval of several key tall sustainable development-style skyscrapers such as Tour Signal, Tour Phare, Hermitage Plaza, and Tour Generali. During said December 2005 Press Conference, EPAD released to the public an elaborate 3D animation film titled &quot;La Défense 2016&quot;.

<text>Autauga County is a county located in the central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census the population was 58,805. Its county seat is Prattville.

Autauga County is part of the Montgomery metropolitan area.

==History==
Autauga County was established on November 21, 1818, by an act of the Alabama Territorial Legislature (one year before Alabama was admitted as a State). As established, the county included present-day Autauga County, as well as Elmore County and Chilton County. At the time, Autauga (aka, Tawasa) Indians lived here. They were concentrated at &quot;Atagi&quot; (meaning &quot;pure water&quot;) village situated on the banks of a creek by the same name (called &quot;Pearl Water Creek&quot; by settlers); it is a tributary of the Alabama River. Other scholars suggest the Creek word &quot;atigi&quot;, meaning &quot;border,&quot; as the source of the name Autauga.

The Autauga were a band of the Alibamu tribe, and named after their geographic location. The Alibamu eventually were absorbed into the Creek Confederacy. During Andrew Jackson&#x27;s invasion of the area during the Creek War, as part of the War of 1812, the Autaga sent many warriors to resist. The county was part of the territory ceded in 1814 by the Creek Confederacy in the Treaty of Fort Jackson.

The territorial legislature designated the first county seat as Jackson&#x27;s Mill, but the court met there only briefly, choosing to select a permanent seat at Washington. The new county seat was built on the former site of Atagi village in the southeast corner of the county. With population growth more in the west of the county, the county seat was moved to a more central location at Kingston in 1830. Losing business and residents to the new county seat, the town of Washington dwindled until it was completely deserted by the late 1830s.

Daniel Pratt arrived in Autauga County in 1833 and founded the new town of Prattville, north of Atagi on the fall line of Autauga Creek. His cotton gin factory quickly became the largest manufacturer of gins in the world; it was the first major industry in Alabama.

Pratt financially backed the recruitment at his factory of men for the Prattville Dragoons, a fighting unit for the Confederacy. It was organized in anticipation of the Civil War. Other units formed in Autauga County included the Autauga Rifles (Autaugaville), The John Steele Guards (western Autauga Co.) and the Varina Rifles (northern Autauga Co.). None of the fighting of the Civil War reached Autauga County. Pratt was able to secure payment of debts from Northern accounts soon after the war, lessening the disabling effects of the Reconstruction period in the county.

Immediately after emancipation in early 1863, Charles Atwood, a freedman who had formerly been enslaved by Daniel Pratt, bought a house in the center of Prattville. He became one of the founding investors in Pratt&#x27;s South and North Railroad. It was exceptional for an African American to become so economically successful and prominent, and to own land in an Alabama city in this period.

In 1866 and 1868, the legislature established Elmore and Chilton counties from Autauga County. The county seat was newly designated as Prattville, which was the population center of the redefined jurisdiction. A new courthouse was completed there in 1870 by local builder George L. Smith. In 1906, a new and larger courthouse was erected a block north; it was designed in a modified Richardsonian Romanesque style. The building was designed by Bruce Architectural Co. of Birmingham and built by Dobson &amp; Bynum of Montgomery.

<text>Baldwin County is a county located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Alabama, on the Gulf coast. It is one of only two counties in Alabama that border the Gulf of Mexico, along with Mobile County. As of the 2020 census, the population was 231,767, making it the fourth-most populous county in Alabama. The county seat is Bay Minette. The county is named after the founder of the University of Georgia, Senator Abraham Baldwin.

Baldwin was Alabama&#x27;s fastest-growing county from 2010 to 2020, with 4 of the top 10 fastest-growing cities in the state in recent years.

The U.S. federal government designates Baldwin County as the Daphne-Fairhope-Foley, AL metropolitan statistical area.

It is the largest county in Alabama by area and is located on the eastern side of Mobile Bay. Part of its western border with Mobile County is formed by the Spanish River, a brackish distributary river.

==History==
Baldwin County was established on December 21, 1809, ten years before Alabama became a state. Previously, the county had been a part of the Mississippi Territory until 1817, when the area was included in the separate Alabama Territory. Statehood was gained by Alabama in 1819.

There have been numerous border changes to the county as population grew and other counties were formed. Numerous armies have invaded during the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil War.

In the first days of Baldwin County, the town of McIntosh Bluff on the Tombigbee River was the county seat. (It is now included in Washington County, northwest of Baldwin County.) The county seat was transferred to the town of Blakeley in 1820, and then to the city of Daphne in 1868. In 1900, by an act of the legislature of Alabama, the county seat was authorized for relocation to the city of Bay Minette; however, the city of Daphne resisted this relocation.

To achieve the relocation, the men of Bay Minette devised a scheme. They fabricated a murder to lure the sheriff and his deputy out of the city of Daphne. While the law was chasing down the fictitious killer during the late hours, the group of Bay Minette men stealthily traveled the to Daphne, stole the Baldwin County Courthouse records, and delivered them to the city of Bay Minette, where Baldwin County&#x27;s county seat remains. A New Deal mural, completed by WPA artists during the Great Depression, depicts these events. It hangs in the Bay Minette United States Post Office.

During the American Civil War, 32 men hailing from Baldwin County enlisted with a Union unit mustered in Pensacola, Florida, called the 1st Florida Cavalry Regiment. In 1860, Baldwin County was the least populous of Alabama&#x27;s 52 counties. Half of the population were enslaved. There was also a large population of Muscogee (Creek) in the northern portion of the county.

During the Cold War, the vice president of Foley-based Gulf Telephone Company, John Mcclure Snook, formed a private militia to resist a potential Communist invasion from the Gulf of Mexico. Due to this militia being armed with automatic weapons from Snook&#x27;s personal collection, the federal government seized the weapons as part of an order during a 1964 libel proceeding. Although Snook paid the taxes imposed on the manufacture of automatic firearms, he sued for a refund on the basis that his militia served as auxiliary deputies for the Baldwin County Sheriff. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected this argument in a 1971 decision as his militia never performed services where use of those weapons were deemed necessary.

Due to its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, Baldwin County frequently endures tropical weather systems, including hurricanes. Since the late 20th century, the county has been declared a disaster area multiple times. This was due to heavy damages in September 1979 from Hurricane Frederic, July 1997 from Hurricane Danny, September 1998 from Hurricane Georges, September 2004 from Hurricane Ivan, August 2005 from Hurricane Katrina and September 2020 from Hurricane Sally.

===2016 flag controversy===
Baldwin County attracted national attention after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting as the only county in the United States to refuse to lower its flags to half-staff. Both President Obama and Alabama governor Robert Bentley had ordered all flags to be lowered immediately following the attack, which was believed to have specifically targeted the LGBTQ community. Citing the U.S. Flag Code, Baldwin County commissioner Tucker Dorsey stated that while his &quot;heart certainly goes out to the victims and their families,&quot; the incident &quot;doesn&#x27;t meet the test of the reason for the flag to be lowered.&quot;

==Geography==

<text>Barbour County is a county in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 25,223. Its county seat is Clayton. Its largest city is Eufaula. Its name is in honor of James Barbour, who served as Governor of Virginia.

==History==
Barbour County was established on December 18, 1832, from former Muscogee homelands and a portion of Pike County. Between the years of 1763 and 1783 the area which is now Barbour County was part of the colony of British West Florida. After 1783 the region fell under the jurisdiction of the newly created United States of America. The Muscogee Creek Confederacy was removed to territory west of the Mississippi River. The fertile land was developed by southern migrants as large cotton plantations dependent on slave labor. Due to the number of slaves, the population was soon majority black, a proportion that continued for decades. In the 21st century, the population has a slight white majority, but blacks make up more than 46% of the residents, which results in highly competitive politics.

In 1833, Louisville was chosen as the first county seat for Barbour County. The county seat was moved in 1834, after an eleven-member committee selected Clayton because of its central geographic location. Its boundaries were altered in 1866 and 1868. The Election Riot of 1874 occurred near Comer.

By the 1870s, the city of Eufaula had surpassed Clayton in size, sparking debate about whether the county seat should be moved to the county&#x27;s commercial center or remain at its geographic center. Reaching a compromise, the legislature passed Act No. 106 on February 12, 1879, to establish county courts in both Eufaula and Clayton. Today, two county courthouses continue to operate in Barbour County.

<text>Bibb County is a county in the central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. The county is a part of the [[Birmingham metropolitan area, Alabama|Birmingham, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area]], and is included in the ARC&#x27;s definition of Appalachia. As of the 24th decennial 2020 census, its population was 22,293. The county seat is Centreville. The county is named in honor of William W. Bibb (1781–1820), the Governor of Alabama Territory (1817–1819) and the first Governor of Alabama (1819–1820, when he died). He is also the namesake for Bibb County, Georgia, where he began his political career. It is a &quot;prohibition&quot; or dry county; however, a few towns have become &quot;wet&quot; by allowing the sale of alcoholic beverages: Woodstock (December 2017), West Blocton (August 2012), Centreville (June 2010), and Brent (May 2010). The Bibb County Courthouse is located in the county seat of Centreville.

==History==
Cahawba County was established (&quot;erected&quot;) on February 7, 1818, named for the Cahawba River (now more commonly known as Cahaba River). This name came from the Choctaw language word meaning &quot;water above.&quot; On December 4, 1820, it was renamed as Bibb County.

In the wake of the American Civil War, the state legislature passed laws to create a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration and effectively excluded Freedmen from the political process. Many residents resisted the objectives of Union occupation both during and after Reconstruction because they wanted to restore the Antebellum social and political norms. During this time of transition, Bibb, Dallas, and Pickens counties held the third-highest number of lynchings in the state. On June 18, 1919, Jim McMillan was lynched by a White mob. On November 7, 2000, Bibb County voted against a proposed amendment to Alabama&#x27;s constitution to abolish the prohibition of interracial marriages.

<doc id="76931" wikidata="Q118958" url="?curid=76931" title="Leuven">
<text>Leuven (, , ), also called Louvain (, , ), is the capital and largest city of the province of Flemish Brabant in the Flemish Region of Belgium. It is located about east of Brussels. The municipality itself comprises the sub-municipalities of Heverlee, Kessel-Lo, Leuven proper, Wilsele, Wijgmaal and part of Haasrode and Korbeek-Lo. It is the eighth largest city in Belgium, with more than 100,244 inhabitants.

Leuven has been a university city since 1425. This makes it the oldest university city in the Low Countries. KU Leuven, the largest Dutch-speaking university in the world and the largest university in the Low Countries (and thus also Belgium&#x27;s largest university), has its flagship campus in Leuven.

The city is home of the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world&#x27;s largest beer brewer and sixth-largest fast-moving consumer goods company.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

The earliest mention of Leuven (&quot;Loven&quot;) dates from 891, when a Viking army was defeated by the Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia (see: Battle of Leuven). According to a legend, the city&#x27;s red and white arms depict the blood-stained shores of the river Dyle after this battle, similarly to the flag of Austria and the flag of Latvia.

Situated beside this river, and near to the stronghold of the Dukes of Brabant, Leuven became the most important centre of trade in the duchy between the 11th and 14th centuries. A token of its former importance as a centre of cloth manufacture is shown in that ordinary linen cloth was known, in late-14th-century and 15th-century texts, as &quot;lewyn&quot; (other spellings: &quot;Leuwyn&quot;, &quot;Levyne&quot;, &quot;Lewan(e)&quot;, &quot;Lovanium&quot;, &quot;Louvain&quot;).

===Early modern period===
In the 15th century, a new golden era began with the founding of the largest and oldest university in the Low Countries, the University of Leuven, in 1425. Prestigious buildings like the Town Hall and the Saint Peter&#x27;s Church (itself designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999) were constructed. The art of painting flourished with painters such as Dirk Bouts, Albrecht Bouts and Jan Rombouts the Elder. The painter Quinten Metsys was born and trained in Leuven.

By the turn of the 16th century, Leuven had become a major European center for art and knowledge with humanists like Erasmus and Hieronymus van Busleyden working there. In 1517 the latter founded the Collegium Trilingue in which the three ancient languages: Latin, Greek and Hebrew were taught. It promoted the critical study of classical literature and the Bible. Thomas More published his &quot;Utopia&quot; at Dirk Martens printing house in Leuven in 1516. Gemma Frisius laid the foundation for modern triangulation methods and cartography. He further made important contributions to mathematics, geography and astronomy. Gerardus Mercator and John Dee were among his students. Leuven became a leading centre for the fabrication of precision astronomical instruments, such as the planetaria and the terrestrial and celestial globes built by Gaspard van der Heyden and Gualterus Arsenius. Andreas Vesalius completed his medicine studies in Leuven, before moving to Padova and Basel. Religious persecutions of Protestants, followed by greater religious and political turmoil starting in the late 1560s, greatly affected intellectual life in Leuven. Many professors and alumni from Leuven moved abroad. The newly founded University of Leiden in Holland, amongst others, would profit greatly from this brain drain. Despite this the university continued to excel in disciplines like theology with Johannes Molanus and classical studies with Justus Lipsius.

===18th and 19th centuries===
In the 18th century, the brewery Den Horn (meaning &quot;the horn&quot;) flourished. In 1708, Sebastien Artois became the master brewer at Den Horn, and gave his name to the brewery in 1717, now part of AB InBev, whose flagship beer, Stella Artois, is brewed in Leuven and sold in many countries.

Leuven developed considerably during the 19th century. Dozens of squares were created, including the Sint-Jacobsplein, the Volksplaats (today&#x27;s Ladeuzeplein) and the Statieplein (today&#x27;s Martelarenplein). From 1835, the streets of the city were lit with gas. The Voer stream was vaulted, the channels occupying the middle of the streets were removed, a number of narrow streets were widened or simply destroyed and a considerable number of sewers were installed. The municipal theatre and the main post office were built, respectively in 1866 and between 1893 and 1895. It was also at this time that the central prison was built.

===20th century===

====World War I====

Leuven has several times been besieged or occupied by foreign armies; these include the Battle of Leuven (891), the Siege of Leuven (1635) and the Battle of Leuven (1831). In the 20th century, both world wars inflicted major damage upon the city. Upon Germany&#x27;s entry into World War I, the town was heavily damaged by rampaging soldiers. In all, about 300 civilians died. The university library was destroyed on 25 August 1914, using petrol and incendiary pastilles. Approximately 230,000 volumes were lost in the destruction, including Gothic and Renaissance manuscripts, a collection of 750 medieval manuscripts, and more than 1,000 incunabula (books printed before 1501). The German atrocities and the cultural destruction caused worldwide outrage. The burning of the city was done as a reprisal, which at the time was legal under international law, as the Germans alleged that Belgian civilians had taken part in the fighting and killed German troops. The old library building was rebuilt after the war, and much of the collection was replaced. A new, dedicated Central Library was built on the square now known as Ladeuzeplein; it was officially opened on 4 July 1928.

====World War II====
In World War II, after the start of the German offensive, Leuven formed part of the British Expeditionary Force&#x27;s front line and was defended by units of the 3rd Division and Belgian troops. From 14 to 16 May 1940, the German Army Group B assaulted the city with heavy air and artillery support. The British withdrew their forces to the River Senne on the night of 16 May and the town was occupied the next day. The new university library building was set on fire by shelling, on 16 May, and nearly a million books were lost.

==Climate==
==Economy==
Given the presence of the KU Leuven, Europe&#x27;s most innovative university according to Reuters, much of the local economy is concentrated on spin-offs from academic research. In addition, the Leuven-based research centre, IMEC, is a research centre in the field of nano-electronics and digital technologies. As a result, dozens of companies in high technological fields such as biotech, robotics, additive manufacturing and IT, are located near these research institutes on the Arenberg Science Park and Haasrode Research-Park. Quite a few international companies such as Siemens, Huawei, Nitto Denko, JSR Corporation or Commscope have important, often research oriented branches, in Leuven. The academic hospital UZ Leuven, first in Europe regarding the number of clinical tests per capita and approval rates for clinical trials, UZ Leuven is another advanced research institute. It is one of Europe&#x27;s largest academic hospitals. As a result, large numbers of private service providers are active in the medical, financial and legal fields.

Because it is the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant, many governmental institutions are located in Leuven, as well as the regional headquarters of transport corporations such as De Lijn. As one of Flanders Art-Cities, with a large range of cafés, restaurants, cultural institutions and shopping neighbourhoods, Leuven also attracts a growing number of tourists.

Leuven is the worldwide headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the largest beer company in the world and is considered one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. InBev&#x27;s Stella Artois brewery and main offices dominate the entire north-eastern part of the town, between the railway station and the canal to Mechelen. Finally, Leuven is the ancestral home of the KBC Group. KBC is one of the leading financial groups in Europe. It is a multi-channel bank-insurance group, with a geographic focus on Belgium and Central Europe, catering mainly to retail clients, SMEs and local midcaps. As one of the largest companies in Belgium and it has its insurance and auto lease HQ in Leuven.

The city itself is made up out of the centre of Leuven (30,313), Kessel-Lo (29,147), Heverlee (22,521), Wilsele (9,786) and Wijgmaal (3,592).

===Student population===
Leuven has a large international student population, mainly concentrated around the city centre. The Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven; University of Leuven) has three campuses in the city, with a total of more than 50,000 students as of June 2024. It is the oldest Catholic university still in existence in the world, and the largest university in Belgium. There are also a number of &quot;hogescholen&quot; (universities of applied sciences), such as the UC Leuven-Limburg (UCLL).

==Transport==
Within the city and its immediate surroundings, most distances can be covered on foot or with a bicycle. Several streets are off-limits to vehicle traffic and, within the city centre, road speed regulations prescribe as the maximum speed limit, making it a pedestrian and bicycle-friendly city. There are also a few car parking lots.

There are numerous buses, primarily operated by the public transport company De Lijn, that connect the city with the region while providing travel options within the city centre. The so-called Ringbus follows the ring road of the city. Buses 91 and 616 connect Leuven with Brussels Airport.

Leuven railway station is located on the NMBS railway lines 35 (Leuven–Aarschot–Hasselt), 36 (Brussels–Liège), 36N (Schaerbeek–Leuven), 53 (Schellebelle–Leuven), and 139 (Leuven–Ottignies). In Bierbeek, south-east of Leuven, lies the beginning of HSL 2, the high-speed railway towards Liège.

The European route E40 passes Leuven in the south, the European route E314 connects Leuven with the city of Aachen.

<doc id="76932" wikidata="Q111259" url="?curid=76932" title="Bullock County, Alabama">
<text>Bullock County is a county of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,357. Union Springs was chosen as the county seat in 1867, and presently is the county&#x27;s only incorporated city. The county was named for Confederate Army Colonel Edward C. Bullock who was a state senator and outspoken secessionist who died during the American Civil War.

A National Center for Education Statistics report released in January 2009 showed that Bullock County had the highest illiteracy rate in Alabama at 34 percent.

==History==
Bullock County was established by act of the state legislature dated December 5, 1866, with areas partitioned from Macon, Pike, Montgomery, and Barbour counties. The boundaries were changed in February 1867.

Prior to the arrival of white settlers, the future Bullock County was inhabited by Creek Indians. The Treaty of Fort Jackson (1814) ceded much of Alabama and Georgia to the US government, and the Creeks were removed completely after 1830. From 1818 through the 1830s, white settlers poured into the area, turning the rich soil into cotton-producing plantations and the area into one of the state&#x27;s richest.

Bullock County was devastated by the Civil War. Its once-enslaved population (about seventy percent of the total population) had sustained its output, but their emancipation caused a sharp decline in the economy. In the aftermath, Bullock County elected two former slaves to the state legislature, but with end of Reconstruction, the black population were severely restricted and kept down.

By 1877 the boll weevil had migrated into Bullock County cotton fields from Mexico, and the area&#x27;s economy was further depressed. A significant portion of the once-cotton-producing area was converted to a site of the Amateur Field Trial competition for bird dogs and a game preserve.

==Geography==
Prior to white settlement, the future Bullock County terrain was completely wooded. It still bears a significant coverage of trees, with the remainder having been cleared for agricultural or urban usage. A range of hills, called Chunnenugga Ridge, bisects the county running east to west. It forms the watershed for the Tallapoosa River on the north, and streams on the south that flow to the Gulf of Mexico, including the Conecuh River, which flows through the extreme west end of Florida to reach the Gulf. The highest point on this ridge (approximately ASL) lies about west of Sehoy Lake.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water.

<text>Butler County is a county located in the south central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 19,051. Its county seat is Greenville. Its name is in honor of Captain William Butler, who was born in Virginia and fought in the Creek War, and who was killed in May 1818.

==History==
Butler County was formed from Conecuh County, Alabama, and Monroe County, Alabama, by an act passed December 13, 1819, by the Legislature while in session at Huntsville. This was the first session of the Legislature of Alabama as a State. The name of Fairfield was first proposed for this county, but was changed on the passage of the bill to Butler, in honor of Captain William Butler.

The precise date of the first settlement made by whites in Butler County is unclear. Some have it as early as 1814, but the earliest settler of no dispute is James K. Benson, who settled in the Flat in 1815, where he built a log house near the current location of Pine Flat Methodist Church. He was soon followed by William Ogly and John Dickerson and their families, who settled on the Federal Road, some south of where later Fort Dale was built. In the fall of 1816, a group of people from Georgia settled in a tent camp in Pine Flat, and the year after, another group settled near Fort Dale.

<doc id="76934" wikidata="Q147676" url="?curid=76934" title="Giovanni da Verrazzano">
<text>Giovanni da Verrazzano ( , ; often misspelled Verrazano in English; 1485–1528) was an Italian (Florentine) explorer of North America, who led most of his later expeditions, including the one to America, in the service of King Francis I of France.

He is renowned as the first European to explore the Atlantic coast of North America between Florida and New Brunswick in 1524, including New York Bay and Narragansett Bay.

==Early life==
Verrazzano was born in Val di Greve, south of Florence, the capital and main city of the Republic of Florence, the son of Piero Andrea di Bernardo da Verrazzano and Fiammetta Cappelli. It is generally claimed that he was born in the Castello di Verrazzano, hence its birth indicator (similar to Leonardo &quot;da Vinci&quot;). 

Some alternative theories have been elaborated; for example, certain French scholars assume that Verrazzano was born in Lyon, France, the son of Alessandro di Bartolommeo da Verrazano and Giovanna Guadagni. 

&quot;Whatever the case,&quot; writes Ronald S. Love, &quot;Verrazzano always considered himself to be Florentine,&quot; and he was considered a Florentine by his contemporaries as well. 

He signed documents employing a Latin version of his name, &quot;Janus Verrazanus&quot;, and he called himself &quot;Jehan de Verrazane&quot; in his will dated 11 May 1526 in Rouen, France (preserved at the Archives départementales de la Seine-Maritime).

In contrast to his detailed account of his voyages to North America, little is definitively known about his personal life. After 1506, he settled in the port of Dieppe, Kingdom of France, where he began his career as a navigator.

He embarked for the American coast probably in 1508 in the company of captain Thomas Aubert, on the ship &quot;La Pensée&quot;, equipped by the owner, Jean Ango. He explored the region of Newfoundland, possibly during a fishing trip, and possibly the St. Lawrence River in Canada; on other occasions, he made numerous voyages to the eastern Mediterranean.

== 1522–24 voyage to North America ==

In September 1522, the surviving members of the Magellan expedition returned to Spain, having circumnavigated the globe. Competition in trade was becoming urgent, especially with Portugal. 

French merchants and financiers urged King Francis I of France to establish new trade routes. In 1523, the king asked Verrazzano to explore on France&#x27;s behalf an area between Florida and Newfoundland, intending to find a sea route to the Pacific Ocean.

Within months, four ships set sail due west for the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, but a violent storm and rough seas caused the loss of two ships. The remaining two damaged ships, &quot;La Dauphine&quot; and &quot;La Normande&quot;, were forced to return to Brittany.

Repairs were completed in the final weeks of 1523, and the ships set sail again. This time, the ships headed south toward calmer waters under hostile Spanish and Portuguese control. 

After a stop in Madeira, complications forced &quot;La Normande&quot; back to home port, but Verrazzano&#x27;s ship &quot;La Dauphine&quot; departed on January 17, 1524, piloted by Antoine de Conflans, and headed once more for the North American continent. 

It neared the area of Cape Fear on March 21, 1524
and, after a short stay, reached the Pamlico Sound lagoon of modern North Carolina. In a letter to Francis I, described by historians as the &quot;Cèllere Codex&quot;, Verrazzano wrote that he was convinced that the Sound was the beginning of the Pacific Ocean from which access could be gained to China.

Continuing to explore the coast further northwards, Verrazzano and his crew came into contact with Native Americans living on the coast. However, he did not notice the entrances to the Chesapeake Bay or the mouth of the Delaware River.

In New York Bay, he encountered the Lenape in about 30 Lenape canoes and observed what he deemed to be a large lake, really the entrance to the Hudson River. He then sailed along Long Island and entered Narragansett Bay, where he received a delegation of Wampanoag and Narragansett people. 

The words &quot;Norman villa&quot; are found on the 1527 map by Visconte Maggiolo identifying the site. The historian Samuel Eliot Morison writes that &quot;this occurs at Angouleme (New York) rather than Refugio (Newport). It was probably intended to compliment one of Verrazzano&#x27;s noble friends. There are several places called &#x27;Normanville&#x27; in Normandy, France. The main one is located near Fécamp and another important one near Évreux, which would naturally be it. West of it, conjecturally on the Delaware or New Jersey coast, is a &quot;Longa Villa&quot;, which Verrazzano certainly named after François d&#x27;Orléans, duc de Longueville.&quot; He stayed there for two weeks and then moved northwards.

He discovered Cape Cod Bay, his claim being proved by a map of 1529 that clearly outlined Cape Cod. He named the cape after a general, calling it Pallavicino. He then followed the coast up to modern Maine, southeastern Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland, and he then returned to France by 8 July 1524. Verrazzano named the region that he explored &quot;Francesca&quot; in honour of the French king, but his brother&#x27;s map labelled it &quot;Nova Gallia&quot; (New France). Stefaan Missinne, discoverer of the 1504 Globe da Vinci, has critically analyzed the contents of Verrazzano&#x27;s travel diary. In the process, he has uncovered important, hitherto unknown iconographic aspects that shed new light on Verrazzano and his connection to Leonardo da Vinci evidence.

==Later life and death==

Verrazzano arranged a second voyage, with financial support from Jean Ango and Philippe de Chabot, which departed from Dieppe with four ships early in 1527. One ship was separated from the others in a gale near the Cape Verde Islands. Still, Verrazzano reached the coast of Brazil with two ships and harvested a cargo of brazilwood before returning to Dieppe in September. The third ship returned later, also with a cargo of brazilwood.

The partial success did not find the desired passage to the Pacific Ocean, but it inspired Verrazzano&#x27;s final voyage, which left Dieppe in early 1528.

There are conflicting accounts of Verrazzano&#x27;s demise. In one version, during his third voyage to North America in 1528, after he had explored Florida, the Bahamas, and the Lesser Antilles, Verrazzano anchored out to sea and rowed ashore, probably on the island of Guadeloupe. He was allegedly killed and eaten by the native Caribs. The fleet of two or three ships was anchored out of gunshot range, and no one could respond in time. However, older historical accounts suggest that Verrazzano was the same person as the corsair Jean Fleury, who was executed for piracy by the Spanish at Puerto del Pico, Spain.

==Legacy==
The geographic information derived from this voyage significantly influenced sixteenth-century cartographers. Despite his discoveries, Verrazzano&#x27;s reputation did not proliferate as much as other explorers of that era. For example, Verrazzano gave the European name Francesca to the new land that he had seen, in accordance with contemporary practices, after the French king in whose name he sailed. That and other names he bestowed on features he discovered have not survived. He had the misfortune of making significant discoveries in the same three years (1519 to 1521) that the dramatic Conquest of the Aztec Empire and Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s circumnavigation of the world occurred. Magellan did not complete his voyage, but his publicist Antonio Pigafetta did so, and Spanish publicity outweighed the news of the French voyage.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a great debate in the United States about the authenticity of the letters that he wrote to Francis I to describe the geography, flora, fauna, and native population of the east coast of North America. Others thought that they were authentic, almost universally the current opinion, particularly after the discovery of a letter signed by Francis I, which referred to Verrazzano&#x27;s letter.

Verrazzano&#x27;s reputation was particularly obscure in New York City, where the 1609 voyage of Henry Hudson on behalf of the Dutch Republic came to be regarded as the &quot;de facto&quot; start of European exploration of New York. It was only by a great effort in the 1950s and 1960s that Verrazzano&#x27;s name and reputation were re-established as the European discoverer of the harbour, during an effort to name the newly built Narrows bridge after him.

===Commemorations===


*In 1909, during the Hudson-Fulton Celebration, a bronze statue of Verrazzano by Ettore Ximenes was installed in Battery Park in Manhattan.
*There are numerous commemorations of the explorer on Staten Island.
**The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, spanning The Narrows that separate Staten Island from Brooklyn, is perhaps the best known. Until October 2018, it was known as the &quot;Verrazano-Narrows Bridge&quot; with one &quot;z&quot;.
**A Staten Island Ferry boat that served New York from the 1950s to the 1990s was also named for Verrazzano. The ferry was named the &quot;Verrazzano&quot;, while the bridge was named &quot;Verrazano&quot;.
**A Little League team on Staten Island is also named for him.
*The Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, is named for him, as is Maryland&#x27;s Verrazano Bridge.
*A vessel of the Regia Marina, a destroyer of the , was named after Verrazzano. She was launched in 1930 and sunk by a British submarine in 1942.
*There is a statue of him in the town of Greve in Chianti, Italy.
*There is a monument commemorating him in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware; it states on its south face:

:The monument further states on its east face:

A native of Val Di Greve in the Tuscany region of Italy, he studied navigation as a young man and became a master mariner. He was engaged by the King of France to lead a voyage to North America in 1524. The purpose of Verrazzano&#x27;s journey was to learn more about the continent. Traveling in a small ship known as the Dauphine, he explored coastal areas from the present-day State of North Carolina to Canada, observing the natural abundance of the land and the vibrant culture of its native peoples. His voyage is the earliest documented European exploration of this part of the Atlantic Coast.This monument rests upon stone from Castello di Verrazzano, the explorer&#x27;s ancestral home.

<doc id="76938" wikidata="Q108856" url="?curid=76938" title="Calhoun County, Alabama">
<text>Calhoun County is a county in the east central part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 116,441. Its county seat is Anniston. It is named in honor of John C. Calhoun, a US Senator from South Carolina.

Calhoun County comprises the Anniston-Oxford Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Benton County was established on December 18, 1832, named for Thomas Hart Benton, a member of the United States Senate from Missouri. Its county seat was Jacksonville. Benton, an enslaver, was a political ally of John C. Calhoun, a U.S. senator from South Carolina, and also a slaveholder and planter. Through the 1820s-1840s, however, Benton&#x27;s and Calhoun&#x27;s political interests diverged. Calhoun was increasingly interested in using the threat of secession as a weapon to maintain and expand slavery throughout the United States. Benton, on the other hand, was slowly concluding that slavery was wrong and that the preservation of the union was paramount. On January 29, 1858, Alabama supporters of slavery, objecting to Benton&#x27;s change of heart, renamed Benton County as Calhoun County.

During the Reconstruction era and widespread violence by whites to suppress black and white Republican voting in the state during the campaign for the 1870 gubernatorial election, four blacks and one white were lynched.

After years of controversy and a State Supreme Court ruling in June 1900, the county seat was moved to Anniston. 

The county was hit by an F4 tornado during the 1994 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak on March 27, 1994. Twelve minutes after the National Weather Service of Birmingham issued a tornado warning for northern Calhoun, southeastern Etowah, and southern Cherokee counties, the tornado destroyed Piedmont&#x27;s Goshen United Methodist Church.

<text>Phenomenology is a philosophical study and movement largely associated with the early 20th century that seeks to objectively investigate the nature of subjective, conscious experience. It attempts to describe the universal features of consciousness while avoiding assumptions about the external world, aiming to describe phenomena as they appear, and to explore the meaning and significance of lived experience.

This approach, while philosophical, has found many applications in qualitative research across different scientific disciplines, especially in the social sciences, humanities, psychology, and cognitive science, but also in fields as diverse as health sciences, architecture, and human-computer interaction, among many others. The application of phenomenology in these fields aims to gain a deeper understanding of subjective experience, rather than focusing on behavior.

Phenomenology is contrasted with phenomenalism, which reduces mental states and physical objects to complexes of sensations, and with psychologism, which treats logical truths or epistemological principles as the products of human psychology. In particular, transcendental phenomenology, as outlined by Edmund Husserl, aims to arrive at an objective understanding of the world via the discovery of universal logical structures in human subjective experience.

There are important differences in the ways that different branches of phenomenology approach subjectivity. For example, according to Martin Heidegger, truths are contextually situated and dependent on the historical, cultural, and social context in which they emerge. Other types include hermeneutic, genetic, and embodied phenomenology. All these different branches of phenomenology may be seen as representing different philosophies despite sharing the common foundational approach of phenomenological inquiry; that is, investigating things just as they appear, independent of any particular theoretical framework.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;phenomenology&quot; derives from the Greek φαινόμενον, &quot;phainómenon&quot; (&quot;that which appears&quot;) and λόγος, &quot;lógos&quot; (&quot;study&quot;). It entered the English language around the turn of the 18th century and first appeared in direct connection to Husserl&#x27;s philosophy in a 1907 article in &quot;The Philosophical Review&quot;.

In philosophy, &quot;phenomenology&quot; refers to the tradition inaugurated by Edmund Husserl at the beginning of the 20th century. The term, however, had been used in different senses in other philosophy texts since the 18th century. These include those by Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777), Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831), and Carl Stumpf (1848–1936), among others.

It was, however, the usage of Franz Brentano (and, as he later acknowledged, Ernst Mach) that would prove definitive for Husserl. From Brentano, Husserl took the conviction that philosophy must commit itself to &quot;description&quot; of what is &quot;given in direct &#x27;self-evidence&#x27;.&quot;

Central to Brentano&#x27;s phenomenological project was his theory of intentionality, which he developed from his reading of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;On the Soul&quot;. According to the phenomenological tradition, &quot;the central structure of an experience is its intentionality, it being directed &quot;towards&quot; something, as it is an experience &quot;of&quot; or &quot;about&quot; some object.&quot; Also, on this theory, every intentional act is implicitly accompanied by a secondary, pre-reflective awareness of the act as one&#x27;s own.

==Overview==

Phenomenology proceeds systematically, but it does not attempt to study consciousness from the perspective of clinical psychology or neurology. Instead, it seeks to determine the essential properties and structures of experience. Phenomenology is not a matter of individual introspection: &quot;a subjective account of experience&quot;, which is the topic of psychology, must be distinguished from &quot;an account of subjective experience&quot;, which is the topic of phenomenology. Its topic is not &quot;mental states&quot;, but &quot;worldly things considered in a certain way&quot;.

Phenomenology is a direct reaction to the psychologism and physicalism of Husserl&#x27;s time. It takes as its point of departure the question of how objectivity is possible at all when the experience of the world and its objects is thoroughly subjective.

So far from being a form of subjectivism, phenomenologists argue that the scientific ideal of a purely objective third-person is a fantasy and falsity. The perspective and presuppositions of the scientist must be articulated and taken into account in the design of the experiment and the interpretation of its results. Inasmuch as phenomenology is able to accomplish this, it can help to improve the quality of empirical scientific research.

Notwithstanding of the field&#x27;s internal diversity, Shaun Gallagher and Dan Zahavi argue that the phenomenological method is composed of four basic steps: the epoché, the phenomenological reduction, the eidetic variation, and intersubjective corroboration.

# The &quot;epoché&quot; is Husserl&#x27;s term for the procedure by which the phenomenologist endeavors to suspend commonsense and theoretical assumptions about reality (what he terms the natural attitude) in order to attend only to what is directly given in experience. This is not a skeptical move; reality is never in doubt. The purpose is to see it more closely as it truly is. The underlying insight is that objects are &quot;experienced and disclosed in the ways they are, thanks to the way consciousness is structured.&quot;
# The &quot;phenomenological reduction&quot; is closely linked to the epoché. The aim of the reduction is to analyze the correlations between what is given in experience and specific structures of subjectivity shaping and enabling this givenness. This &quot;leads back&quot; (Latin: &quot;re-ducere&quot;) to the world.
# &quot;Eidetic variation&quot; is the process of imaginatively stripping away the properties of things to determine what is essential to them, that is, what are the characteristics without which a thing would not be the thing that it is (&quot;Eidos&quot; is Plato&#x27;s Greek word for the essence of a thing). Significantly for the phenomenological researcher, eidetic variation can be practiced on acts of consciousness themselves to help clarify, for instance, the structure of perception or memory. Husserl openly acknowledges that the essences uncovered by this method include various degrees of vagueness and also that such analyses are defeasible. He contends, however, that this does not undermine the value of the method.
# &quot;Intersubjective corroboration&quot; is simply the sharing of one&#x27;s results with the larger research community. This allows for comparisons that help to sort out what is idiosyncratic to the individual from what might be essential to the structure of experience as such.

According to phenomenologist Maurice Natanson, &quot;The radicality of the phenomenological method is both continuous and discontinuous with philosophy&#x27;s general effort to subject experience to fundamental, critical scrutiny: to take nothing for granted and to show the warranty for what we claim to know.&quot; Husserl says that the suspension of belief in what is ordinarily taken for granted or inferred by conjecture diminishes the power of what is customarily embraced as objective reality. In the words of philosopher Rüdiger Safranski, &quot;[Husserl and his followers&#x27;] great ambition was to disregard anything that had until then been thought or said about consciousness or the world [while] on the lookout for a new way of letting the things [they investigated] approach them, without covering them up with what they already knew.&quot;

==History==
Edmund Husserl &quot;set the phenomenological agenda&quot; for even those who did not strictly adhere to his teachings, such as Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, to name just the foremost. Each thinker has &quot;different conceptions of phenomenology, different methods, and different results.&quot;

===Husserl&#x27;s conceptions===
Husserl derived many important concepts central to phenomenology from the works and lectures of his teachers, the philosophers and psychologists Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf. An important element of phenomenology that Husserl borrowed from Brentano is intentionality (often described as &quot;aboutness&quot; or &quot;directedness&quot;), the notion that consciousness is always consciousness &quot;of&quot; something. The object of consciousness is called the &quot;intentional object&quot;, and this object is constituted for consciousness in many different ways, through, for instance, perception, memory, signification, and so forth. Throughout these different intentionalities, though they have different structures and different ways of being &quot;about&quot; the object, an object is still constituted as the identical object; consciousness is directed at the same intentional object in direct perception as it is in the immediately-following retention of this object and the eventual remembering of it.

As envisioned by Husserl, phenomenology is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since Plato in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual&#x27;s &quot;lived experience.&quot; Loosely rooted in an epistemological device called epoché, Husserl&#x27;s method entails the suspension of judgment while relying on the intuitive grasp of knowledge, free of presuppositions and intellectualizing. Sometimes depicted as the &quot;science of experience,&quot; the phenomenological method, rooted in intentionality, represents an alternative to the representational theory of consciousness. That theory holds that reality cannot be grasped directly because it is available only through perceptions of reality that are representations in the mind. In Husserl&#x27;s own words:

experience is not an opening through which a world, existing prior to all experience, shines into a room of consciousness; it is not a mere taking of something alien to consciousness into consciousness... Experience is the performance in which for me, the experiencer, experienced being &quot;is there&quot;, and is there &quot;as what&quot; it is, with the whole content and the mode of being that experience itself, by the performance going on in its intentionality, attributes to it.

In effect, he counters that consciousness is not &quot;in&quot; the mind; rather, consciousness is conscious of something other than itself (the intentional object), regardless of whether the object is a physical thing or just a figment of the imagination.

====&quot;Logical Investigations&quot; (1900/1901)====
In the first edition of the &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;, under the influence of Brentano, Husserl describes his position as &quot;descriptive psychology.&quot; Husserl analyzes the intentional structures of mental acts and how they are directed at both real and ideal objects. The first volume of the &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;, the &quot;Prolegomena to Pure Logic&quot;, begins with a critique of psychologism, that is, the attempt to subsume the &quot;a priori&quot; validity of the laws of logic under psychology. Husserl establishes a separate field for research in logic, philosophy, and phenomenology, independently from the empirical sciences.

&quot;Pre-reflective self-consciousness&quot; is Shaun Gallagher and Dan Zahavi&#x27;s term for Husserl&#x27;s (1900/1901) idea that self-consciousness always involves a self-appearance or self-manifestation prior to self-reflection. This is one point of nearly unanimous agreement among phenomenologists: &quot;a minimal form of self-consciousness is a constant structural feature of conscious experience. Experience happens for the experiencing subject in an immediate way and as part of this immediacy, it is implicitly marked as &quot;my&quot; experience.&quot;

====&quot;Ideas&quot; (1913)====
In 1913, Husserl published &quot;Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology&quot;. In this work, he presents phenomenology as a form of &quot;transcendental idealism&quot;. Although Husserl claimed to have always been a transcendental idealist, this was not how many of his admirers had interpreted the &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;, and some were alienated as a result.

This work introduced distinctions between the act of consciousness (&quot;noesis&quot;) and the phenomena at which it is directed (the &quot;noemata&quot;). &quot;Noetic&quot; refers to the intentional act of consciousness (believing, willing, etc.). &quot;Noematic&quot; refers to the object or content &quot;(noema)&quot;, which appears in the noetic acts (the believed, wanted, hated, loved, etc.).

What is observed is not the object as it is in itself, but how and inasmuch it is given in the intentional acts. Knowledge of essences would only be possible by &quot;bracketing&quot; all assumptions about the existence of an external world and the inessential (subjective) aspects of how the object is concretely given to us. This &quot;phenomenological reduction&quot; is the second stage of Husserl&#x27;s procedure of epoché. That which is essential is then determined by the imaginative work of &quot;eidetic variation&quot;, which is a method for clarifying the features of a thing without which it would not be what it is.

Husserl concentrated more on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. As he wanted to exclude any hypothesis on the existence of external objects, he introduced the method of phenomenological reduction to eliminate them. What was left over was the pure transcendental ego, as opposed to the concrete empirical ego.

&quot;Transcendental phenomenology&quot; is the study of the essential structures that are left in pure consciousness: this amounts in practice to the study of the noemata and the relations among them.

====Munich phenomenology====
Some phenomenologists were critical of the new theories espoused in &quot;Ideas&quot;. Members of the Munich group, such as Max Scheler and Roman Ingarden, distanced themselves from Husserl&#x27;s new transcendental phenomenology. Their theoretical allegiance was to the earlier, realist phenomenology of the first edition of &quot;Logical Investigations&quot;.

===Heidegger&#x27;s conception===
Martin Heidegger modified Husserl&#x27;s conception of phenomenology because of what Heidegger perceived as Husserl&#x27;s subjectivist tendencies. Whereas Husserl conceived humans as having been constituted by states of consciousness, Heidegger countered that consciousness is peripheral to the primacy of one&#x27;s existence, for which he introduces Dasein as a technical term, which cannot be reduced to a mode of consciousness. From this angle, one&#x27;s state of mind is an &quot;effect&quot; rather than a determinant of existence, including those aspects of existence of which one is not conscious. By shifting the center of gravity to existence in what he calls fundamental ontology, Heidegger altered the subsequent direction of phenomenology.

According to Heidegger, ontologically-inflected phenomenology is more fundamental than modern scientific inquiry. According to him, science is only one way of knowing the world with no special access to truth. Furthermore, the scientific mindset itself is built on a much more &quot;primordial&quot; foundation of practical, everyday knowledge. This emphasis on the fundamental status of a person&#x27;s pre-cognitive, practical orientation in the world, sometimes called &quot;know-how&quot;, would be adopted by both Sartre and Merleau-Ponty.

While for Husserl, in the epoché, being appeared only as a correlate of consciousness, for Heidegger the pre-conscious grasp of being is the starting point. For this reason, he replaces Husserl&#x27;s concept of intentionality with the notion of &quot;comportment&quot;, which is presented as &quot;more primitive&quot; than the &quot;conceptually structured&quot; acts analyzed by Husserl. Paradigmatic examples of comportment can be found in the unreflective &quot;dealing&quot; with &quot;equipment&quot; that presents itself as simply &quot;ready-to-hand&quot; in what Heidegger calls the normally &quot;circumspect&quot; mode of engagement within the world.

For Husserl, all concrete determinations of the empirical ego would have to be abstracted in order to attain pure consciousness. By contrast, Heidegger claims that &quot;the possibilities and destinies of philosophy are bound up with man&#x27;s existence, and thus with temporality and with historicality.&quot; For this reason, all experience must be seen as shaped by social context, which for Heidegger joins phenomenology with philosophical hermeneutics.

Husserl charged Heidegger with raising the question of ontology but failing to answer it, instead switching the topic to Dasein. That is neither ontology nor phenomenology, according to Husserl, but merely abstract anthropology.

While &quot;Being and Time&quot; and other early works are clearly engaged with Husserlian issues, Heidegger&#x27;s later philosophy has little relation to the problems and methods of classical phenomenology.

===Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s conception===

Maurice Merleau-Ponty develops his distinctive mode of phenomenology by drawing, in particular, upon Husserl&#x27;s unpublished writings, Heidegger&#x27;s analysis of being-in-the-world, Gestalt theory, and other contemporary psychology research. In his most famous work, &quot;The Phenomenology of Perception&quot;, Merleau-Ponty critiques empiricist and intellectualist accounts to chart a &quot;third way&quot; that avoids their metaphysical assumptions about an objective, pre-given world.

The central contentions of this work are that the body is the locus of engagement with the world, and that the body&#x27;s modes of engagement are more fundamental than what phenomenology describes as consequent acts of objectification. Merleau-Ponty reinterprets concepts like intentionality, the phenomenological reduction, and the eidetic method to capture our inherence in the perceived world, that is, our embodied coexistence with things through a kind of reciprocal exchange. According to Merleau-Ponty, perception discloses a meaningful world that can never be completely determined, but which nevertheless aims at truth.

==Varieties==

Some scholars have differentiated phenomenology into seven types:
# Transcendental constitutive phenomenology studies how objects are constituted in transcendental consciousness, setting aside questions of any relation to the natural world.
# Naturalistic constitutive phenomenology studies how consciousness constitutes things in the world of nature, assuming with the natural attitude that consciousness is part of nature.
# Generative historicist phenomenology studies how meaning—as found in human experience—is generated in historical processes of collective experience over time.
# Genetic phenomenology (sometimes &quot;phenomenology of genesis&quot;) studies the emergence of meanings of things within the stream of experience.
# Hermeneutic(al) phenomenology studies interpretive structures of experience. This approach was introduced in Martin Heidegger&#x27;s early work.
# Existential phenomenology studies concrete human existence, including human experience of free choice and/or action in concrete situations.
# Realist(ic) phenomenology (sometimes &quot;phenomenology of essences&quot;) studies the structure of consciousness and intentionality as &quot;it occurs in a real world that is largely external to consciousness and not somehow brought into being by consciousness.&quot;

The contrast between &quot;constitutive phenomenology&quot; (sometimes &quot;static/descriptive phenomenology&quot;) and &quot;genetic phenomenology&quot; is due to Husserl.

Modern scholarship also recognizes the existence of the following varieties: early-Heideggerian transcendental hermeneutic phenomenology, Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s embodied phenomenology, Michel Henry&#x27;s material phenomenology, Alva Noë&#x27;s analytic phenomenology, and J. L. Austin&#x27;s linguistic phenomenology.

==Concepts==
===Intentionality===
Intentionality refers to the notion that consciousness is always the consciousness &quot;of&quot; something. The word itself should not be confused with the &quot;ordinary&quot; use of the word intentional, but should rather be taken as playing on the etymological roots of the word. Originally, intention referred to a &quot;stretching out&quot; (&quot;in tension,&quot; from Latin &quot;intendere&quot;), and in this context it refers to consciousness &quot;stretching out&quot; towards its object. However, one should be careful with this image: there is not some consciousness first that, subsequently, stretches out to its object; rather, consciousness &quot;occurs as&quot; the simultaneity of a conscious act and its object.

Intentionality is often summed up as &quot;aboutness.&quot; Whether this &quot;something&quot; that consciousness is about is in direct perception or in fantasy is inconsequential to the concept of intentionality itself; whatever consciousness is directed at, &quot;that&quot; is what consciousness is conscious of. This means that the object of consciousness does not &quot;have&quot; to be a &quot;physical&quot; object apprehended in perception: it can just as well be a fantasy or a memory. Consequently, these &quot;structures&quot; of consciousness, such as perception, memory, fantasy, and so forth, are called &quot;intentionalities&quot;.

The term &quot;intentionality&quot; originated with the Scholastics in the medieval period and was resurrected by Brentano who in turn influenced Husserl&#x27;s conception of phenomenology, who refined the term and made it the cornerstone of his theory of consciousness. The meaning of the term is complex and depends entirely on how it is conceived by a given philosopher. The term should not be confused with &quot;intention&quot; or the psychoanalytic conception of unconscious &quot;motive&quot; or &quot;gain&quot;.

Significantly, &quot;intentionality is not a relation, but rather an intrinsic feature of intentional acts.&quot; This is because there are no independent relata. It is (at least in the first place) a matter of indifference to the phenomenologist whether the intentional object has any existence independent of the act.

===Intuition===
Intuition in phenomenology refers to cases where the intentional object is directly present to the intentionality at play; if the intention is &quot;filled&quot; by the direct apprehension of the object, one has an intuited object. Having a cup of coffee in front of oneself, for instance, seeing it, feeling it, or even imagining it – these are all filled intentions, and the object is then &quot;intuited&quot;. The same goes for the apprehension of mathematical formulae or a number. If one does not have the object as referred to directly, the object is not intuited, but still intended, but then &quot;emptily&quot;. Examples of empty intentions can be signitive intentions – intentions that only &quot;imply&quot; or &quot;refer to&quot; their objects.

===Evidence===
In everyday language, the word evidence is used to signify a special sort of relation between a state of affairs and a proposition: State A is evidence for the proposition &quot;A is true.&quot; In phenomenology, however, the concept of evidence is meant to signify the &quot;subjective achievement of truth.&quot; This is not an attempt to reduce the objective sort of evidence to subjective &quot;opinion,&quot; but rather an attempt to describe the structure of having something present in intuition with the addition of having it present as &quot;intelligible&quot;: &quot;Evidence is the successful presentation of an intelligible object, the successful presentation of something whose truth becomes manifest in the evidencing itself.&quot;

In &quot;Ideas&quot;, Husserl presents as the &quot;Principle of All Principles&quot; that, &quot;every originary presentive intuition is a legitimizing source of cognition, that everything originally (so to speak, in its &#x27;personal&#x27; actuality) offered to us in &#x27;intuition&#x27; is to be accepted simply as what it is presented as being, but also only within the limits in which it is presented there.&quot; It is in this realm of phenomenological givenness, Husserl claims, that the search begins for &quot;indubitable evidence that will ultimately serve as the foundation for every scientific discipline.&quot;

===Noesis and noema===

Franz Brentano introduced a distinction between sensory and noetic consciousness: the former describes presentations of sensory objects or intuitions, while the latter describes the thinking of concepts.

In Husserl&#x27;s phenomenology, this pair of terms, derived from the Greek &quot;nous&quot; (mind) designate respectively the real content, noesis, and the ideal content, noema, of an intentional act (an act of consciousness). The noesis is the part of the act that gives it a particular sense or character (as in judging or perceiving something, loving or hating it, accepting or rejecting it, etc.). This is real in the sense that it is actually part of what takes place in the consciousness of the subject of the act. The noesis is always correlated with a noema. For Husserl, the full noema is a complex ideal structure comprising at least a noematic sense and a noematic core. The correct interpretation of what Husserl meant by the noema has long been controversial, but the noematic sense is generally understood as the ideal meaning of the act. For instance, if A loves B, loving is a real part of A&#x27;s conscious activity – noesis – but gets its sense from the general concept of loving, which has an abstract or ideal meaning, as &quot;loving&quot; has a meaning in the English language independently of what an individual means by the word when they use it. The noematic core as the act&#x27;s referent or object &quot;as it is meant in the act&quot;. One element of controversy is whether this noematic object is the same as the actual object of the act (assuming it exists) or is some kind of ideal object.

===Empathy and intersubjectivity===

In phenomenology, empathy refers to the experience of one&#x27;s own body &quot;as&quot; another. While people often identify others with their physical bodies, this type of phenomenology requires that they focus on the subjectivity of the other, as well as the intersubjective engagement with them. In Husserl&#x27;s original account, this was done by a sort of apperception built on the experiences of one&#x27;s own lived body. The lived body is one&#x27;s own body as experienced by oneself, &quot;as&quot; oneself. One&#x27;s own body manifests itself mainly as one&#x27;s possibilities of acting in the world. It is what lets oneself reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows for the possibility of changing one&#x27;s point of view. This helps to differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that one saw other aspects of just a moment ago (it is identical). One&#x27;s body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (one&#x27;s ability to touch one&#x27;s own hand) and as one&#x27;s own subjectivity (one&#x27;s experience of being touched).

The experience of one&#x27;s own body as one&#x27;s own subjectivity is then applied to the experience of another&#x27;s body, which, through apperception, is constituted as another subjectivity. One can thus recognise the Other&#x27;s intentions, emotions, etc. This experience of empathy is important in the phenomenological account of intersubjectivity. In phenomenology, intersubjectivity constitutes objectivity (i.e., what one experiences as objective is experienced as being intersubjectively available – available to all other subjects. This does not imply that objectivity is reduced to subjectivity nor does it imply a relativist position, cf. for instance intersubjective verifiability).

In the experience of intersubjectivity, one also experiences oneself as being a subject among other subjects, and one experiences oneself as existing objectively &quot;for&quot; these Others; one experiences oneself as the noema of Others&#x27; noeses, or as a subject in another&#x27;s empathic experience. As such, one experiences oneself as objectively existing subjectivity. Intersubjectivity is also a part in the constitution of one&#x27;s lifeworld, especially as &quot;homeworld.&quot;

===Lifeworld===
The lifeworld (German: &quot;Lebenswelt&quot;) is the &quot;world&quot; each one of us &quot;lives&quot; in. One could call it the &quot;background&quot; or &quot;horizon&quot; of all experience, and it is that on which each object stands out as itself (as different) and with the meaning it can only hold for us. According to Husserl, the lifeworld is both personal and intersubjective (it is then called a &quot;homeworld&quot;), and, as such, it avoids the threat of solipsism.

==Phenomenology and empirical science==
The phenomenological analysis of objects is notably different from traditional science. However, several frameworks do phenomenology with an empirical orientation or aim to unite it with the natural sciences or with cognitive science.

For a classical critical point of view, Daniel Dennett argues for the wholesale uselessness of phenomenology considering &quot;phenomena&quot; as qualia, which cannot be the object of scientific research or do not exist in the first place. Liliana Albertazzi counters such arguments by pointing out that empirical research on phenomena has been successfully carried out employing modern methodology. Human experience can be investigated by surveying, and with brain scanning techniques. For example, ample research on color perception suggests that people with normal color vision see colors similarly and not each in their own way. Thus, it is possible to universalize phenomena of subjective experience on an empirical scientific basis.

In the early twenty-first century, phenomenology has increasingly engaged with cognitive science and philosophy of mind. Some approaches to the naturalization of phenomenology reduce consciousness to the physical-neuronal level and are therefore not widely acknowledged as representing phenomenology. These include the frameworks of neurophenomenology, embodied constructivism, and the cognitive neuroscience of phenomenology. Other likewise controversial approaches aim to explain life-world experience on a sociological or anthropological basis despite phenomenology being mostly considered descriptive rather than explanatory.

<text>In geometry, two geometric objects are perpendicular if they intersect at right angles, i.e. at an angle of 90 degrees or π/2 radians. The condition of perpendicularity may be represented graphically using the &quot;perpendicular symbol&quot;, ⟂. Perpendicular intersections can happen between two lines (or two line segments), between a line and a plane, and between two planes.

&quot;Perpendicular&quot; is also used as a noun: a perpendicular is a line which is perpendicular to a given line or plane.

Perpendicularity is one particular instance of the more general mathematical concept of &quot;orthogonality&quot;; perpendicularity is the orthogonality of classical geometric objects. Thus, in advanced mathematics, the word &quot;perpendicular&quot; is sometimes used to describe much more complicated geometric orthogonality conditions, such as that between a surface and its &quot;normal vector&quot;.

A line is said to be perpendicular to another line if the two lines intersect at a right angle. Explicitly, a first line is perpendicular to a second line if (1) the two lines meet; and (2) at the point of intersection the straight angle on one side of the first line is cut by the second line into two congruent angles. Perpendicularity can be shown to be symmetric, meaning if a first line is perpendicular to a second line, then the second line is also perpendicular to the first. For this reason, we may speak of two lines as being perpendicular (to each other) without specifying an order. A great example of perpendicularity can be seen in any compass, note the cardinal points; North, East, South, West (NESW)
The line N-S is perpendicular to the line W-E and the angles N-E, E-S, S-W and W-N are all 90° to one another.

Perpendicularity easily extends to segments and rays. For example, a line segment formula_1 is perpendicular to a line segment formula_2 if, when each is extended in both directions to form an infinite line, these two resulting lines are perpendicular in the sense above. In symbols, formula_3 means line segment AB is perpendicular to line segment CD.

A line is said to be perpendicular to a plane if it is perpendicular to every line in the plane that it intersects. This definition depends on the definition of perpendicularity between lines.

Two planes in space are said to be perpendicular if the dihedral angle at which they meet is a right angle.

==Foot of a perpendicular==
The word foot is frequently used in connection with perpendiculars. This usage is exemplified in the top diagram, above, and its caption. The diagram can be in any orientation. The foot is not necessarily at the bottom.

More precisely, let be a point and a line. If is the point of intersection of and the unique line through that is perpendicular to , then is called the &quot;foot&quot; of this perpendicular through .
== Construction of the perpendicular ==
To make the perpendicular to the line AB through the point P using compass-and-straightedge construction, proceed as follows (see figure left):

* Step 1 (red): construct a circle with center at P to create points A&#x27; and B&#x27; on the line AB, which are equidistant from P.
* Step 2 (green): construct circles centered at A&#x27; and B&#x27; having equal radius. Let Q and P be the points of intersection of these two circles.
* Step 3 (blue): connect Q and P to construct the desired perpendicular PQ.

To prove that the PQ is perpendicular to AB, use the SSS congruence theorem for QPA&#x27; and QPB&#x27; to conclude that angles OPA&#x27; and OPB&#x27; are equal. Then use the SAS congruence theorem for triangles OPA&#x27; and OPB&#x27; to conclude that angles POA and POB are equal.

To make the perpendicular to the line g at or through the point P using Thales&#x27;s theorem, see the animation at right.

The Pythagorean theorem can be used as the basis of methods of constructing right angles. For example, by counting links, three pieces of chain can be made with lengths in the ratio 3:4:5. These can be laid out to form a triangle, which will have a right angle opposite its longest side. This method is useful for laying out gardens and fields, where the dimensions are large, and great accuracy is not needed. The chains can be used repeatedly whenever required.

== In relationship to parallel lines ==
If two lines (&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;) are both perpendicular to a third line (&quot;c&quot;), all of the angles formed along the third line are right angles. Therefore, in Euclidean geometry, any two lines that are both perpendicular to a third line are parallel to each other, because of the parallel postulate. Conversely, if one line is perpendicular to a second line, it is also perpendicular to any line parallel to that second line.

In the figure at the right, all of the orange-shaded angles are congruent to each other and all of the green-shaded angles are congruent to each other, because vertical angles are congruent and alternate interior angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines are congruent. Therefore, if lines &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are parallel, any of the following conclusions leads to all of the others:

* One of the angles in the diagram is a right angle.
* One of the orange-shaded angles is congruent to one of the green-shaded angles.
* Line &quot;c&quot; is perpendicular to line &quot;a&quot;.
* Line &quot;c&quot; is perpendicular to line &quot;b&quot;.
* All four angles are equal.

==In computing distances==
== Graph of functions ==

In the two-dimensional plane, right angles can be formed by two intersected lines if the product of their slopes equals −1. Thus for two linear functions formula_4 and formula_5, the graphs of the functions will be perpendicular if formula_6 

The dot product of vectors can be also used to obtain the same result: First, shift coordinates so that the origin is situated where the lines cross. Then define two displacements along each line, formula_7, for formula_8 Now, use the fact that the inner product vanishes for perpendicular vectors:
:formula_9
:formula_10
:formula_11
:formula_12 (unless formula_13 or formula_14 vanishes.)

Both proofs are valid for horizontal and vertical lines to the extent that we can let one slope be formula_15, and take the limit that formula_16 If one slope goes to zero, the other goes to infinity.

==In circles and other conics==

===Circles===

Each diameter of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent line to that circle at the point where the diameter intersects the circle.

A line segment through a circle&#x27;s center bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord.

If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and divides the other chord into lengths &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, then equals the square of the diameter.

The sum of the squared lengths of any two perpendicular chords intersecting at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8&quot;r&quot;2 – 4&quot;p&quot;2 (where &quot;r&quot; is the circle&#x27;s radius and &quot;p&quot; is the distance from the center point to the point of intersection).

Thales&#x27; theorem states that two lines both through the same point on a circle but going through opposite endpoints of a diameter are perpendicular. This is equivalent to saying that any diameter of a circle subtends a right angle at any point on the circle, except the two endpoints of the diameter.

===Ellipses===

The major and minor axes of an ellipse are perpendicular to each other and to the tangent lines to the ellipse at the points where the axes intersect the ellipse.

The major axis of an ellipse is perpendicular to the directrix and to each latus rectum.

===Parabolas===

In a parabola, the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to each of the latus rectum, the directrix, and the tangent line at the point where the axis intersects the parabola.

From a point on the tangent line to a parabola&#x27;s vertex, the other tangent line to the parabola is perpendicular to the line from that point through the parabola&#x27;s focus.

The orthoptic property of a parabola is that If two tangents to the parabola are perpendicular to each other, then they intersect on the directrix. Conversely, two tangents which intersect on the directrix are perpendicular. This implies that, seen from any point on its directrix, any parabola subtends a right angle.

===Hyperbolas===

The transverse axis of a hyperbola is perpendicular to the conjugate axis and to each directrix.

The product of the perpendicular distances from a point P on a hyperbola or on its conjugate hyperbola to the asymptotes is a constant independent of the location of P.

A rectangular hyperbola has asymptotes that are perpendicular to each other. It has an eccentricity equal to formula_17

==In polygons==

===Triangles===

The legs of a right triangle are perpendicular to each other.

The altitudes of a triangle are perpendicular to their respective bases. The perpendicular bisectors of the sides also play a prominent role in triangle geometry.

The Euler line of an isosceles triangle is perpendicular to the triangle&#x27;s base.

The Droz-Farny line theorem concerns a property of two perpendicular lines intersecting at a triangle&#x27;s orthocenter.

Harcourt&#x27;s theorem concerns the relationship of line segments through a vertex and perpendicular to any line tangent to the triangle&#x27;s incircle.

===Quadrilaterals===

In a square or other rectangle, all pairs of adjacent sides are perpendicular. A right trapezoid is a trapezoid that has two pairs of adjacent sides that are perpendicular.

Each of the four maltitudes of a quadrilateral is a perpendicular to a side through the midpoint of the opposite side.

An orthodiagonal quadrilateral is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are perpendicular. These include the square, the rhombus, and the kite. By Brahmagupta&#x27;s theorem, in an orthodiagonal quadrilateral that is also cyclic, a line through the midpoint of one side and through the intersection point of the diagonals is perpendicular to the opposite side.

By van Aubel&#x27;s theorem, if squares are constructed externally on the sides of a quadrilateral, the line segments connecting the centers of opposite squares are perpendicular and equal in length.

==Lines in three dimensions==

Up to three lines in three-dimensional space can be pairwise perpendicular, as exemplified by the &quot;x, y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; axes of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.

<text>Chilton County is a county located in the central portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 45,014. The county seat is Clanton. Its name is in honor of William Parish Chilton, Sr. (1810–1871), a lawyer who became Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and later represented Montgomery County in the Congress of the Confederate States of America.

Chilton County is included in the Birmingham Metropolitan Statistical Area.

In 2010, the center of population of Alabama was located in Chilton County, near the city of Jemison, an area known as Jemison Division.

The county is known for its peaches and its unique landscape. It is home to swamps, prairies, and mountains due to the foothills of the Appalachians which end in the county, the Coosa River basin, and its proximity to the Black Belt Prairie that was long a center of cotton production.

==History==
Baker County was established on December 30, 1868, named for Alfred Baker, with its county seat at Grantville. Residents of the county petitioned the Alabama legislature for the renaming of their county; it was not something forced upon them. On December 17, 1874, the petitioners accepted the suggestion of Chilton County, even though the Chief Justice had not lived within its boundaries. In 1871, the county seat was moved to what is now Clanton after the Grantville courthouse burned.

In 1942, the U.S. Navy commissioned a new vessel, the USS &quot;Chilton&quot;, in honor of Chilton County.

About 12.60% of families and 15.70% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.40% of those under age 18 and 18.20% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
Chilton County contains one public school district. There are approximately 7,700 students in public PK-12 schools in Chilton County.

===Districts===
School districts include:

* Chilton County School District

==Government==
The County Commission is made up of seven members elected by cumulative vote (CV). &quot;Chilton County adopted cumulative voting in 1988 as part of the settlement of a vote dilution lawsuit brought against its previous election system. According to the 1990 Census, African Americans constituted 9.9% of the county&#x27;s voting age population.&quot; Although passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 enabled African Americans to register and vote, in Chilton County no African American was elected to the County Commission until the first cumulative voting election, held in 1988.

African Americans in Alabama had been essentially disenfranchised by the 1901 state constitution, which required payment of a poll tax and qualification by a literacy test in order to register to vote. Discriminatory in practice as administered by white officials, this system excluded most blacks from the state&#x27;s political system for decades in the 20th century before Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. After that, African Americans were able finally to register and vote in the county and state for the first time since the late 19th century.

In counties in which there is a minority population and members are elected at-large or by single-member districts, minorities may be unable to elect representatives in a system dominated by the majority. The adoption of cumulative voting in Chilton County has enabled the minority to elect candidates of their choice by pooling their votes. Bobby Agee was elected as a Chilton County Commissioner in 1988 and again in the second cumulative voting election in 1992. Cumulative voting depends on a multi-seat election, whether at-large or by district. &quot;The cumulative options provide a minority of voters an opportunity to concentrate their support for a candidate or candidates more effectively than they can under the more traditional voting rules used in this country.&quot; In 2014, the county commission had an African-American commissioner among its seven members. However, in 2018, the county commissioners were all white males.

The commission hires a County Administrator to handle daily management of county business.

Chilton County is reliably Republican at the presidential level. The last Democrat to win the county in a presidential election is Jimmy Carter, who won it by a majority in 1976.

<text>The Thames Barrier is a retractable barrier system built to protect the floodplain of most of Greater London from exceptionally high tides and storm surges moving up from the North Sea. It has been operational since 1982. When needed, it is closed (raised) during high tide; at low tide, it can be opened to restore the river&#x27;s flow towards the sea. Built about east of the Isle of Dogs, its northern bank is in Silvertown in the London Borough of Newham and its southern bank is in the New Charlton area of the Royal Borough of Greenwich.

==History==
===Background===
Flooding in London has been a problem since Roman times. In 1954, the Waverley Committee, established to investigate the serious North Sea flood of 1953 which affected parts of the Thames Estuary and parts of London, recommended that &quot;as an alternative to raising the banks, the possibility and cost of erecting a structure across the Thames which could be closed in a surge should be urgently investigated&quot;. A number of designs were put forward, from a huge road viaduct with two 500 foot (150 m) sluice gates crossing the Thames at Crayfordness to flap gates lying on the river bed and floated up by compressed air. By 1965, when the Greater London Council (GLC) took over responsibility, two major schemes were under consideration, costed at £24 million and £41 million respectively (£500 million and £800 million at 2020 prices).

In 1966, Sir Hermann Bondi was asked to take an independent view of the situation. He considered the estimated construction costs and the probability of a flood and of damage if the barrier was not built. He strongly recommended that a barrier should be built in order to avoid the catastrophe of flooding central London, and a site was agreed at Woolwich.

The barrier protects central London against a storm surge, caused when a deep depression forms to the north of Scotland and progresses across the North Sea and south-easterly towards southern Scandinavia. When such a surge coincides with a high spring tide, the high winds associated with the depression can funnel the water up the Thames Estuary and cause surges of up to 3.5 metres (11.6 feet). The planners assessed that in the absence of a barrier, such a surge could inundate 45 square miles (117 km2) of land, put hospitals, power stations and the London Underground out of action and cause damage estimated in 1966 at £2 billion (about £50 billion at 2020 prices). The barrier was designed to provide a flood defence capable of resisting a once in 1000 year surge tide at a base date of 2030.

===Design and construction===
The concept of the rising sector gates was devised by (Reginald) Charles Drapeer. In 1969, from his parents&#x27; house in Pellatt Grove, Wood Green, London, he constructed a working model. The novel rotating cylinders were based on the design of the taps on his gas cooker. The barrier was designed by Rendel, Palmer and Tritton for the Greater London Council and the concept tested at the Hydraulics Research Station, Wallingford. The site at New Charlton was chosen because of the relative straightness of the banks, and because the underlying river chalk was strong enough to support the barrier.

The Thames Barrier and Flood Prevention Act, authorising construction, was passed in 1972. In 1974, the GLC placed the two major construction contracts. Civil construction was undertaken by a Costain/Hollandsche Beton Maatschappij/Tarmac Construction consortium. A separate contract for the gates and operating machinery was placed with the Davy Cleveland Barrier Consortium, formed by Davy McKee Ltd of Sheffield and Cleveland Bridge UK Ltd.

Work began at the barrier site in 1974 and progressed in two phases. The southern piers (9 to 6) were built first, with river traffic diverted to the north side, then traffic routed through the completed southern spans whilst the north side piers (1 to 5) were built. During construction of the piers, precast concrete sills were built in a cofferdam on the north side of the river and floated out and sunk between the piers to form the gate recesses, with access tunnels at the upstream and downstream ends.

The gates of the barrier were fabricated in sections at Cleveland Bridge&#x27;s Darlington works and assembled at Port Clarence on the River Tees. The gates, gate arms and rocking beams were transported from the Tees to the Thames by barge and lifted into position by two very large floating cranes operated by Neptun of Hamburg (now part of Smit International). The mechanical and hydraulic machinery was built by Davy Loewy, Henry Berry and Vickers and trial assembled in Davy&#x27;s Darnall works. Delays to the civil works required changes to the construction and installation sequence, but commissioning was relatively uneventful and the first trial operation of all the gates together was carried out on 31 October 1982.

In addition to the barrier, the flood defences down river were raised and strengthened. The barrier was officially opened on 8 May 1984 by Queen Elizabeth II. The barrier cost £ (£ now). Total construction cost was around £535 million (£2.4 billion at 2024 prices) with an additional £100 million for river defences.

Built across a wide stretch of the river, the barrier divides the river into four and two approximately 30-metre (100 ft) navigable spans. There are also four smaller non-navigable channels between nine concrete piers and two abutments. The flood gates across the openings are circular segments in cross section, and they operate by rotating, raised to allow &quot;underspill&quot; to allow operators to control upstream levels and a complete 180 degree rotation for maintenance. All the gates are hollow and made of steel up to thick. The gates are filled with water when submerged and empty as they emerge from the river. The four large central gates are high and weigh 3,700 tonnes each. Four radial gates by the river banks, also about 30 metres (100 ft) wide, can be lowered. These gate openings, unlike the main six, are non-navigable.

===Predictions for operation===
A Thames Barrier flood defence closure is triggered when a combination of high tides forecast in the North Sea and high river flows at the tidal limit at Teddington Lock indicate that water levels would exceed in central London. Though Teddington marks the Normal Tidal Limit, in periods of very high fluvial flow the tidal influence can be seen as far upstream as East Molesey on the Thames.


===Barrier closures and incidents===
, there have been 221 flood defence closures. The barrier was closed twice on 9 November 2007 after a storm surge in the North Sea which was compared to the one in 1953. The main danger of flooding from the surge was on the coast above the Thames Barrier, where evacuations took place, but the winds abated a little and, at the Thames Barrier, the 9 November 2007 storm surge did not completely coincide with high tide.

On 20 August 1989, hours after the &quot;Marchioness&quot; disaster, the barrier was closed against a spring tide for 16 hours &quot;to assist the diving and salvage operations&quot;.

The barrier has survived 15 boat collisions without serious damage.

On 27 October 1997, the barrier was damaged when the dredger MV &quot;Sand Kite&quot; hit one of the piers in thick fog. As the ship started to sink she dumped her 3,300-tonne load of aggregate, finally sinking by the bow on top of one of the barrier&#x27;s gates, where she lay for several days. Initially the gate could not be closed as it was covered in a thick layer of gravel. A longer-term problem was the premature loss of paint on the flat side of the gate caused by abrasion. The vessel was refloated in mid-November 1997.

The annual full test closure in 2012 was scheduled for 3 June to coincide with the Thames pageant celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Environment Agency said the pageant provided &quot;a unique opportunity to test its design for a longer period than we would normally be able to&quot;, and performance under conditions of &quot;a higher water level upstream than downstream&quot;; also that the &quot;more stable tidal conditions … in central London … will help the vessels taking part&quot;.

===Ownership and operating authority===
The barrier was originally commissioned by the Greater London Council under the guidance of Ray Horner. After the 1986 abolition of the GLC it was operated successively by Thames Water Authority (dissolved 1989) and then the National Rivers Authority until April 1996 when it passed to the Environment Agency.

===Operations===
The barrier was originally designed to protect London against a very high flood level (with an estimated return period of one hundred years) up to the year 2030, after which the protection would decrease, while remaining within acceptable limits. At the time of its construction, the barrier was expected to be used 2–3 times per year. By the mid-2000s it was being operated 6–7 times a year. In the 2010s, the barrier was generally (as a median) closed twice a year but the average is still 6–7 due to the extreme of 50 times in 2013–14.

This defence level allowed for long-term changes in sea and land levels as understood at that time (c. 1970). From 1982 until 19 March 2007, the barrier was raised one hundred times to prevent flooding. It is also raised monthly for testing, with a full test closure over high tide once a year.

===Past proposals for development===
Released in 2005, a study by four academics contained a proposal to supersede the Thames Barrier with a more ambitious 16 km (10 mi) long barrier across the Thames Estuary from Sheerness in Kent to Southend-on-Sea in Essex.

In November 2011, a new Thames Barrier, further downstream at Lower Hope between East Tilbury in Essex and Cliffe in Kent, was proposed as part of the Thames Hub integrated infrastructure vision. The barrier would incorporate turbines to generate renewable energy and include road and rail tunnels, providing connections from Essex to a major new Thames Estuary Airport on the Isle of Grain.

In 2019 architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands and marine engineers Beckett Rankine launched a proposal for a pedestrian and cycle bridge located next to the Thames Barrier; the scheme, called the Thames Barrier Bridge, was promoted as the only location in east London where a low-level opening bridge across the Thames could have relatively moderate opening spans of about .

==Future==
===2012 debate on changing climatic conditions===
In a January 2013 letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, a former member of the Thames Barrier Project Management Team, Dr Richard Bloore, stated that it was not designed with increased storminess and sea level rises in mind, and called for a new barrier to be looked into immediately. 

The Environment Agency responded that it did not plan to replace the Thames Barrier before 2070, as it was designed with an allowance for sea level rise of per year, which has not happened in the intervening years. At the time, the barrier was around halfway through its designed lifespan. The standard of protection it provides will gradually decline over time after 2030, from a 1-in-1000-year event. The Environment Agency was examining the Thames Barrier for its potential design life under climate change, with early indications being that subject to appropriate modification, the Thames Barrier would be capable of providing continued protection to London against rising sea levels.

===2023 review - decision by 2040===
A UK Environment Agency review in 2023 said that new climate models showed heightened risk of flooding, implying a need for raised defences upstream of the Thames Barrier by 2050, but that the Thames Barrier was expected to continue to operate until 2070.
A decision on the best option for adapting to sea level rise to 2100 will be taken by 2040.
As of 2024 concerns exist that climate change is occurring faster than previously expected.

<text>The Château de Villandry is a grand country house located in Villandry, in the &quot;département&quot; of Indre-et-Loire, France. It is especially known for its beautiful gardens.

==History==
The lands where an ancient fortress once stood were known as &quot;Columbine&quot; until the 17th century. They were acquired in the early 16th century by Jean Le Breton, France&#x27;s Controller-General for War under King Francis I, and a new château was constructed around the original 14th-century keep where King Philip II of France once met Richard I of England to discuss peace.

The château remained in the Le Breton family for more than two centuries until it was acquired by the Marquis de Castellane. During the French Revolution the property was confiscated and in the early 19th century, Emperor Napoleon acquired it for his brother Jérôme Bonaparte.

In 1906, Joachim Carvallo purchased the property, financed by his wife Ann Coleman, who was an heiress to the Coleman fortune. Extensive time, money, and devotion were then poured into repairing it and creating extraordinary gardens. Its famous Renaissance gardens include a water garden, ornamental flower gardens, and vegetable gardens. The gardens are laid out in formal patterns created with low box hedges. In 1934, Château de Villandry was designated a Monument historique. Like all the other châteaux of the Loire Valley, it is a World Heritage Site.

==Recent times==
Still owned by the Carvallo family, the Château de Villandry is open to the public and is one of the most visited châteaux in France; in 2007 the château received about 330,000 visitors.

<doc id="76951" wikidata="Q111254" url="?curid=76951" title="Choctaw County, Alabama">
<text>Choctaw County is a county located in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,665. The county seat is Butler. The county was established on December 29, 1847, and named for the Choctaw tribe of Native Americans.

==History==
Choctaw County was originally part of the Choctaw Nation, with Choctaw settlements known to be in the vicinity of Pushmataha prior to the removal of Native Americans from the southeastern United States during the Trail of Tears.

Most of the early European American pioneers of Choctaw County were farmers from North and South Carolina. In 1912 the Alabama, Tennessee and Northern Railroad was completed through the county from north to south, connecting the area to the Port of Mobile and northern Alabama. It induced a population shift from areas near the Tombigbee River to the central part of the county.

The county&#x27;s population reached its peak in the 1920s, due in part from jobs created by a sawmill boom with companies as the E. E. Jackson Lumber Company and Choctaw Lumber Company. The sawmill industry collapsed during the Great Depression. The first successful oil well in Alabama was drilled at Gilbertown in 1944, with oil and gas becoming the county&#x27;s most important industry. This industry waned by the 1970s as the wells lost profitability.

An African-American family, the Thorntons of Mobile, was featured in the September 24, 1956, issue of &quot;Life&quot;. The article included an interview with the Thorntons&#x27; daughter, Allie Lee Causey, of Shady Grove in Choctaw County. In the article, Mrs. Causey, a schoolteacher, spoke openly about her family&#x27;s life, stating that &quot;integration is the only way in which Negroes will receive justice. We cannot get it as a separate people. If we can get justice on our jobs, and equal pay, then we&#x27;ll be able to afford better homes and good education.&quot; When the magazine was seen in Choctaw County, the Causeys were subjected to brutal economic retaliation by white residents, who tried to coerce Mrs. Causey into recanting her remarks. Their loans were called in, local stores refused to sell them food and gasoline, Willie Causey was cut off from his employment as a woodcutter, and Mrs. Causey was fired from her job as a teacher. The Causeys left Shady Grove and Alabama for good in October 1956.

Apparel factories opened during the 1950s–60s in Silas, Toxey, and Butler, although the plants had largely closed by the 21st century. The 1950s also saw the building a paper mill at Naheola, now owned and operated by Georgia-Pacific. The county was declared a disaster area in September 1979, due to damage from Hurricane Frederic. The 1980s saw the main railroad close and the tracks removed.

<text>The Qibya massacre occurred during Operation Shoshana, an Israeli so-called reprisal operation that occurred in October 1953, when IDF&#x27;s Unit 101 led by future Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon attacked the village of Qibya in the West Bank, which was then under Jordanian control, and killed more than sixty-nine Palestinian civilians, two-thirds of whom were women and children. 

Forty-five houses, a school, and a mosque were destroyed. Ariel Sharon wrote in his diary that &quot;Qibya was to be an example for everyone,&quot; and that he ordered &quot;maximal killing and damage to property&quot;. Post-operational reports speak of breaking into houses and clearing them with grenades and shooting. 

The attack followed cross-border raids from the West Bank. Israel framed the Qibya massacre as a response to the Yehud attack, in which an Israeli woman and her two children were killed.

The massacre was condemned by the U.S. State Department, the UN Security Council, and by Jewish communities worldwide. The State Department described the raid as &quot;shocking&quot; and used the occasion to confirm publicly that economic aid to Israel had been suspended previously, for other non-compliance regarding the 1949 Armistice Agreements.

==Background==
The attack took place in the context of border clashes between Israel and neighbouring states, which had begun almost immediately after the signing of the 1949 Armistice Agreements following onset of the Nakba. Along the 1949 armistice line, infiltrations, armed or otherwise, were frequent from both sides. Many infiltrations from Jordanian territory in the West Bank consisted of unarmed Palestinian refugees attempting to rejoin their families. During 1948–49, most of the infiltrators crossed the borders to harvest crops left behind, to plant new crops in their abandoned lands, or to retrieve goods. Many others came to resettle in their old villages or elsewhere inside Israel, or to visit relatives, or simply to get a glimpse of their abandoned homes and fields. During the following years the vast majority came to steal crops, irrigation pipes, farm animals, or other property belonging to settlers, or to graze their flocks. Some engaged in smuggling goods or mail—certain items, such as Bedouin clothing, were often unavailable in Israel, and there were no postal services between Israel and the Arab states. Others moved through Israeli territory in order to reach other Arab countries, most frequently from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank. Most of the infiltrators were unarmed individuals, though it appears that the proportion who came armed and in groups steadily increased after 1950.

Half of Jordan&#x27;s prison population at the time consisted of people arrested for attempting to return to, or illegally enter, Israeli territory, but the number of complaints filed by Israel over infiltrations from the West Bank show a considerable reduction, from 233 in the first nine months of 1952, to 172 for the same period in 1953, immediately before the attack. This marked reduction was in good part the result of increased Jordanian efficiency in patrolling.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/635/Rev.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Between June 1949 and the end of 1952, a total of 57 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed by Palestinian infiltrators from the Jordanian West Bank. The Israeli death toll for the first nine months of 1953 was 32. Over roughly the same time (November 1950 – November 1953), the Mixed Armistice Commission condemned Israeli raids 44 times. For the same period, 1949–1953, Jordan maintained that it alone suffered 629 killed and injured from Israeli incursions and cross-border bombings. UN sources for the period, based on the documentation at General Bennike&#x27;s disposal (prepared by Commander E H Hutchison USNR), lower both estimates.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/636/Rev.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the year leading up to the raid, Israeli forces and civilians had conducted many punitive expeditions, causing destruction of infrastructure and crops and many civilian casualties against Palestinian villages, with Latrun, Falameh (Falāma, Falamya), Rantis, Qalqiliya, Khirbet al-Deir, Khirbet Rasm Nofal, Khirbet Beit Emin, Qatanna, Wadi Fukin, Idhna, and Surif being the most notable examples. Meanwhile, Palestinian guerilla raids into Israel continued. Over a two-week period in late May and early June, four raids by Palestinian fedayeen killed 3 and wounded 6 people in Israel, at Beit Arif, Beit Nabala, Tirat Yehuda and Kfar Hess which, according to the UN, greatly concerned both the Israeli and Jordanian governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/PV.630&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific incident which the Israeli government used to justify its assault on Qibya occurred on 12 October 1953, when a Jewish woman, Suzanne Kinyas, and her two children were killed by a grenade thrown into their house in the Israeli town of Yehud, some inside of the Green Line. The attack initially drew a sharp rebuke to Jordan from the Mixed Armistice Commission. The Israeli government immediately claimed that the killings were perpetrated by Palestinian infiltrators, a charge queried by Jordanian officials, who were skeptical, and who offered to collaborate with Israel in order to apprehend the guilty parties, whoever and wherever they were. Moshe Sharett said later that &quot;the Commander of the Jordan Legion, Glubb Pasha, had asked for police bloodhounds to cross over from Israel to track down the Yahud attackers&quot;. On the other hand, some weeks later, while assisting a United Nations and Jordanian team following the tracks of the person(s) who on 1 November had blown up a water-line in Jordanian territory supplying the Arab quarter of Jerusalem, tracks that led to the Scopus fence, the Israeli inspector delegated to the team denied them permission to enter the Jewish area around Mount Scopus and prosecute their investigation. For the first time, Israel accepted Jordan&#x27;s offer of assistance and the tracks of the perpetrator were traced to a point 1400m over the border, to a road near Rantis, but dried up there. The United Nations observer team&#x27;s investigation failed to find any evidence indicating who committed the crime, and the Jordanian delegate to the Mixed Commission condemned the act in strong language on 14 October. The Chief of Staff of the Arab Legion in Amman flew to Jerusalem to ask that no retaliatory actions take place that might compromise Jordanian investigations underway on their side of the border.

According to the former &quot;Time&quot; correspondent to Jerusalem, Donald Neff: &quot;Force had to be used to demonstrate to the Arabs that Israel was in the Middle East to stay, Ben Gurion believed, and to that end he felt strongly that his retaliatory policy had to be continued.&quot;

Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon gave the order, in coordination with Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. The Israeli elected governing cabinet was not informed, and though Minister of Foreign Affairs Moshe Sharett was privy to prior deliberations on whether or not such a punitive raid ought to be conducted, he expressed strong disapproval of the proposal, and was deeply shocked when informed of the outcome.

== The attack ==
According to the Mixed Armistice Commission report, approved on the afternoon immediately following the operation, and delivered by Major General Vagn Bennike to the UN Security Council, the raid at Qibya took place on the evening of 14 October 1953 at around 9.30 pm, and was taken by roughly half a battalion strength of soldiers from the Israeli regular army. Later sources state the force consisted of 130 IDF troops of whom a third came from Unit 101. The American chairman of the Mixed Armistice Commission in his report to the UN Security Council estimated that between 250 and 300 Israeli soldiers were involved in the attack. The raid was personally led by future Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who at the time was a Major in the IDF and the commander of Unit 101.

The attack began with a mortar barrage on the village until Israeli forces reached the outskirts of the village. Israeli troops employed Bangalore torpedoes to breach the barbed-wire fences surrounding the village, and mined roads to prevent Jordanian forces from intervening. At the same time at least 25 mortar shells were fired into the neighbouring village of Budrus. The Israeli troops simultaneously entered the village from three sides. IDF soldiers encountered resistance from soldiers and village guards, and in the gunbattle that followed, 10–12 soldiers and guards defending the village were killed and an Israeli soldier was lightly wounded. Military engineers dynamited dozens of buildings across the village, killing scores of civilians. In the words of historian Rashid Khalidi, the operation “blew up forty-five homes with their inhabitants inside.&quot; At dawn, the operation was considered complete, and the Israelis returned home.

Ariel Sharon later wrote in his diary that he had received orders to inflict heavy damage on the Arab Legion forces in Qibya: &quot;The orders were utterly clear: Qibya was to be an example for everyone.&quot; Original documents of the time showed that Sharon personally ordered his troops to achieve &quot;maximal killing and damage to property&quot;, and post-operational reports speak of breaking into houses and clearing them with grenades and shooting. UN observers noted that they observed bodies near doorways, and bullet marks on the doors of demolished houses, and later concluded that residents might have been forced by heavy fire to stay in their homes.

==International reaction==
An emergency meeting of the Mixed Armistice Commission (MAC) was held in the afternoon of 15 October and a resolution condemning the regular Israel army for its attack on Qibya, as a breach of article III, paragraph 2,62/ of the Israel-Jordan General Armistice Agreement was adopted by a majority vote.

The UN Security Council subsequently adopted Resolution 100 on 27 October 1953. On 24 November, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 101 and expressed the &quot;strongest possible censure of this action.&quot;

The attack was universally condemned by the international community. The U.S. State Department issued a bulletin on 18 October 1953, expressing its &quot;deepest sympathy for the families of those who lost their lives&quot; in Qibya as well as the conviction that those responsible &quot;should be brought to account and that effective measures should be taken to prevent such incidents in the future.&quot; The State Department described the raid as &quot;shocking&quot;, and used the occasion to confirm publicly that economic aid to Israel had been previously suspended. The aid, as Israel had been informed on 18 September, had been &quot;deferred&quot; until Israel saw fit to cooperate with the United Nations in the Demilitarized Zone, in relation to its ongoing water diversion work near Bnot Ya&#x27;akov Bridge; that site had been chosen as the original location for the intake of Israel&#x27;s National Water Carrier, but it would be moved downstream to the Sea of Galilee at Eshed Kinrot, following this US pressure.

==Israeli reaction==
The international outcry caused by the operation required a formal reply by Israel. Intense discussions took place, and Moshe Sharett summed up, in his diary on 16 October, the opinion that:
Now the army wants to know how we (the Foreign Ministry) are going to explain the issue. In a joint meeting of army and foreign ministry officials Shmuel Bendor suggested that we say that the army had no part in the operation, but that the inhabitants of the border villages, infuriated by previous incidents and seeking revenge, operated on their own. Such a version will make us appear ridiculous: any child would say that this was a military operation. (16 October 1953)

Notwithstanding Sharett&#x27;s advice that broadcasting this version would make Israel appear patently &quot;ridiculous&quot;, on 19 October Ben-Gurion publicly asserted that the raid had been carried out by Israeli civilians.

None deplores it more than the Government of Israel, if ... innocent blood was spilled ... The Government of Israel rejects with all vigor the absurd and fantastic allegation that 600 men of the IDF took part in the action ... We have carried out a searching investigation and it is clear beyond doubt that not a single army unit was absent from its base on the night of the attack on Qibya. (Statement by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, ISA FM 2435/5)

On Israeli Radio that same day, Ben-Gurion addressed the nation, repeating the accusation that the massacre had been perpetrated by Israeli civilians:

The [Jewish] border settlers in Israel, mostly refugees, people from Arab countries and survivors from the Nazi concentration camps, have, for years, been the target of (...) murderous attacks and had shown a great restraint. Rightfully, they have demanded that their government protect their lives and the Israeli government gave them weapons and trained them to protect themselves.

But the armed forces from Transjordan did not stop their criminal acts, until [the people in] some of the border settlements lost their patience and after the murder of a mother and her two children in Yahud, they attacked, last week, the village of Kibya across the border, that was one of the main centers of the murderers&#x27; gangs. Every one of us regrets and suffers when blood is shed anywhere and nobody regrets more than the Israeli government the fact that innocent people were killed in the retaliation act in Kibya. But all the responsibility rests with the government of Transjordan that for many years tolerated and thus encouraged attacks of murder and robbery by armed powers in its country against the citizens of Israel.

Israeli historian Avi Shlaim observed that the official Israeli version was not believed, and it did nothing to reduce the damage to Israel&#x27;s image. &quot;This was not Ben-Gurion&#x27;s first lie for what he saw as the good of his country, nor was it to be the last, but it was one of the most blatant.&quot;

Sharon later claimed that he had &quot;thought the houses were empty&quot; and that the unit had checked all houses before detonating the explosives. In his autobiography &quot;Warrior&quot; (1987) Sharon wrote:
I couldn&#x27;t believe my ears. As I went back over each step of the operation, I began to understand what must have happened. For years Israeli reprisal raids had never succeeded in doing more than blowing up a few outlying buildings, if that. Expecting the same, some Arab families must have stayed in their houses rather than running away. In those big stone houses [...] some could easily have hidden in the cellars and back rooms, keeping quiet when the paratroopers went in to check and yell out a warning. The result was this tragedy that had happened.

Uri Avnery, founder and editor of the magazine &quot;HaOlam HaZeh&quot;, relates that he had both his hands broken when he was ambushed for criticizing the massacre at Qibya in his newspaper.

==Results==
According to Daniel Byman, the attack, &quot;controversial, brutal, and bloody – worked,&quot; leading Jordan to arrest more than a thousand fedayeen and stepped up its patrolling of the border.

Following the attack, the Arab Legion deployed soldiers on the border segment near Qibya to stop further infiltrations and deter further Israeli incursions. There was a brief overall reduction in incursions along the border.

After this incident, Israel restricted attacks on civilian targets. Despite the U.S. request that those involved be brought to account, Sharon was not prosecuted. The independence of Unit 101 was cancelled and several weeks later it was dismantled altogether.

Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon&#x27;s words to the General Staff in July 1954 were, &quot;Guys, you have to understand [that] there can be the greatest and most successful military operation, and it will turn into a political failure, meaning eventually a military failure as well. I&#x27;ll give a simple example: Qibya.&quot;

<text>Galerius Valerius Maximinus Daza, born as Daza (; 20 November 270 – July 313), was Roman emperor from 310 to 313. He became embroiled in the civil wars of the Tetrarchy between rival claimants for control of the empire, in which he was defeated by Licinius. A committed pagan, he engaged in one of the last persecutions of Christians, before issuing an edict of tolerance granting Christians their freedoms back near his death. Maximinus Daza is the last to be referred as Pharaoh of Egypt.

==Name==
The emperor Maximinus was originally called &quot;Daza&quot;, an ancient name with various unknown high distinction meanings in Illyria, where he was born. The form &quot;Daia&quot; given by the Christian writer Lactantius, an important source on the emperor&#x27;s life, is considered a misspelling. He acquired the name &quot;Maximinus&quot; at the request of his maternal uncle, Galerius (a Roman emperor of Dacian and Thracian origin), and his full name as emperor was &quot;Galerius Valerius Maximinus Daza&quot;. Modern scholarship often refers to him as &quot;Maximinus Daza&quot;, though this particular form is not attested by epigraphic or literary evidence.

==Early career==
He was born in the Roman Illyria region to the sister of emperor Galerius near their family lands around Felix Romuliana, in Roman Dacia, a rural area then also in the former Danubian region of Moesia, now modern Eastern Serbia. He showed signs of having a strong Military Aptitude at a young age. He later rose to high distinction after joining the Roman Army.

In 305, his maternal uncle Galerius became the eastern &quot;Augustus&quot; and adopted Maximinus as a son and heir, raising him to the rank of &quot;Caesar&quot; (that is, the junior eastern ruler), and granting him the government of Syria and Egypt.

==Civil war==
In 308, after the elevation of Licinius to &quot;Augustus&quot;, Maximinus and Constantine I were declared &quot;filii Augustorum&quot; (&quot;sons of the Augusti&quot;), but Maximinus probably started styling himself as &quot;Augustus&quot; with support of his troops during a campaign against the Sassanids in 310. On the death of Galerius in 311, Maximinus divided the Eastern Empire between Licinius and himself. When Licinius and Constantine I began to make common cause, Maximinus entered into a secret alliance with the usurper Maxentius, who controlled Italy. He came to an open rupture with Licinius in 313; he summoned an army of 70,000 men but sustained a crushing defeat at the Battle of Tzirallum in the neighbourhood of Heraclea Perinthus on 30 April. He fled, first to Nicomedia and afterwards to Tarsus, where he died the following August.

==Persecution of Christians==

Maximinus has a controversial name in Christian annals for renewing their persecution after the publication of the Edict of Toleration by Galerius, acting in response to the demands of various urban authorities asking to expel Christians. In one rescript replying to a petition made by the inhabitants of Tyre, transcribed by Eusebius of Caesarea, Maximinus expounds a pagan orthodoxy, explaining that it is through &quot;the kindly care of the gods&quot; that one could hope for good crops, health, and the peaceful sea, and that not being the case, one should blame &quot;the destructive error of the empty vanity of those impious men [that] weighed down the whole world with shame&quot;. In one extant inscription (CIL III.12132, from Arycanda) from the cities of Lycia and Pamphylia asking for the interdiction of the Christians, Maximinus replied, in another inscription, by expressing his hope that &quot;may those [...] who, after being freed from [...] those by-ways [...] rejoice [as] snatched from a grave illness&quot;.

After the victory of Constantine over Maxentius, however, Maximinus wrote to the Praetorian Prefect Sabinus that it was better to &quot;recall our provincials to the worship of the gods rather by exhortations and flatteries&quot;. Eventually, on the eve of his clash with Licinius, he accepted Galerius&#x27; edict; after being defeated by Licinius, shortly before his death at Tarsus, he issued an edict of tolerance on his own, granting Christians the rights of assembling, of building churches, and the restoration of their confiscated properties.
==Pharaoh of Egypt==

As Christianity continued to spread in Egypt, the title of Pharaoh was increasingly incompatible with the new religious movements. Maximinus&#x27;s status as a non-Christian accorded the priests of Egypt an opportunity to style him as Pharaoh, in the same manner that other foreign rulers of Egypt had been styled before. That said, the Roman emperors themselves mostly ignored the status accorded to them by the Egyptians; and their role as god-kings was only ever acknowledged domestically by the Egyptians themselves. Maximinus would prove to be the last person afforded the traditional titulature of Pharaoh – no Christian Roman/Byzantine emperor, nor Islamic or modern leader, has revived the title since. As the last monarch to employ traditional pharaonic titulature, Maximinus&#x27; death can be seen as marking the end of a 3,400-year-old office.

==Death==
Maximinus&#x27; death was variously ascribed &quot;to despair, to poison, and to the divine justice&quot;.

Based on descriptions of his death given by Eusebius, and Lactantius as well as the appearance of Graves&#x27; ophthalmopathy in a Tetrarchic statue bust from Anthribis in Egypt sometimes attributed to Maximinus, endocrinologist Peter D. Papapetrou has advanced a theory that Maximinus may have died from severe thyrotoxicosis due to Graves&#x27; disease.

Maximinus was married at the time of his death, and he left behind an 8 year old son named Maximus and an unnamed 7 year old daughter.

==Eusebius on Maximinus==
The Christian writer Eusebius claims that Maximinus was consumed by avarice and superstition. He also allegedly lived a highly dissolute lifestyle:

And he went to such an excess of folly and drunkenness that his mind was deranged and crazed in his carousals; and he gave commands when intoxicated of which he repented afterward when sober. He suffered no one to surpass him in debauchery and profligacy, but made himself an instructor in wickedness to those about him, both rulers and subjects. He urged on the army to live wantonly in every kind of revelry and intemperance, and encouraged the governors and generals to abuse their subjects with rapacity and covetousness, almost as if they were rulers with him.&lt;br&gt;
Why need we relate the licentious, shameless deeds of the man, or enumerate the multitude with whom he committed adultery? For he could not pass through a city without continually corrupting women and ravishing virgins.

According to Eusebius, only Christians resisted him.

For the men endured fire and sword and crucifixion and wild beasts and the depths of the sea, and cutting off of limbs, and burnings, and pricking and digging out of eyes, and mutilations of the entire body, and besides these, hunger and mines and bonds. In all they showed patience in behalf of religion rather than transfer to idols the reverence due to God.
And the women were not less manly than the men in behalf of the teaching of the Divine Word, as they endured conflicts with the men, and bore away equal prizes of virtue. And when they were dragged away for corrupt purposes, they surrendered their lives to death rather than their bodies to impurity.

He refers to one high-born Christian woman who rejected his advances. He exiled her and seized all of her wealth and assets. Eusebius does not give the girl a name, but Tyrannius Rufinus calls her &quot;Dorothea,&quot; and writes that she fled to Arabia. This story may have evolved into the legend of Dorothea of Alexandria. Caesar Baronius identified the girl in Eusebius&#x27; account with Catherine of Alexandria, but the Bollandists rejected this theory.

<doc id="76955" wikidata="Q111273" url="?curid=76955" title="Clarke County, Alabama">
<text>Clarke County is a county located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2020 census, the population was 23,087. The county seat is Grove Hill. The county&#x27;s largest city is Jackson. The county was created by the legislature of the Mississippi Territory in 1812. It is named in honor of General John Clarke of Georgia, who was later elected governor of that state.

The county museum is housed in the Alston-Cobb House in Grove Hill.

==History==
===Pre-European era===
For thousands of years, this area was occupied along the rivers by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. At the time of European encounter, Clarke County was the traditional home of the Choctaw and the Creek people. They traded with the French, who had settlements in Mobile and New Orleans. They also were reached by some English and Scots traders from the British colonies along the Atlantic Coast. After the Louisiana Purchase, they started to establish relations with the United States.

In 1805, by the Treaty of Mount Dexter, the Choctaw conveyed large amounts of land in what is now southeastern Mississippi and southwestern Alabama, including much of the western portion of Clarke County, to the United States for settlement by European Americans.

===Modern era===
Clarke County was established on December 10, 1812, by the Mississippi Territory. The county had numerous forts, built by settlers for protection during the Creek War (1813–1814). Some of these forts included: Fort Carney, Fort Easley, Fort Glass, Fort Landrum, Fort Madison, Fort Sinquefield, Turner&#x27;s Fort, and Fort White. The first county seat was Clarkesville, founded in 1820. The seat was moved to Macon, later renamed Grove Hill, in 1831. 

In 1883, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Tony Pace and Mary Cox for interracial dating, in &quot;Pace v. Alabama&quot;. That precedent was subsequently overturned. In 1892, Clarke County was the scene of a violent confrontation around economic divides that later became known as the Mitcham War.

===Alcohol prohibition===
Following the national repeal of prohibition in 1933, Clarke County voted to become a dry county in 1937, when wet-dry counties were established in Alabama.

In the first decade of the 21st century, the county&#x27;s largest communities voted to legalize alcohol sales: Jackson on May 10, 2005; Thomasville on August 14, 2007; and Grove Hill on November 3, 2009.

===Salt production===
Clarke County is home to numerous salt springs. These springs have been used as a source for salt as early as the Mississippian period in 1100 AD. During the Civil War, the county was notable for its salt production due to the naval blockade of southern ports. The Commissioner&#x27;s Court of Clarke County appropriated $1500 in 1862 for the manufacturing of salt at the salt springs and the State of Alabama operated multiple salt works during the Civil War. These salt works had housing for workers, hospitals, and cemeteries and the salt was produced for military and civilian use. Forts were built at Oven Bluff (Fort Sidney Johnston) and Carney Bluff (Fort Gullett) to protect the salt works and the approach up the Tombigbee River while an additional fort was built at Choctaw Bluff (Fort Stonewall) to protect any advance up the Alabama River.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (or 1.1%) is water. It is the third-largest county in Alabama by land area and the fourth-largest by total area.

==Education==
Clarke County contains two public school districts. There are approximately 3,400 students in public PK-12 schools in Clarke County.

===Districts===
School districts include:

* Clarke County School District
* Thomasville City School District

==Government==
Since 1960, the majority of Clarke County voters has mostly supported Republican candidates for the presidency, but party affiliations have changed. Prior to the civil rights era, most whites were members of the Democratic Party, although they began to vote for Nixon and other Republican presidential candidates.

After the Civil War, many African Americans had joined the Republican Party, but they were essentially disenfranchised around the turn of the 20th century by state changes to its constitution and laws, making voter registration more difficult. After they regained their ability to vote through national legislation in the mid-1960s, they largely joined the Democratic Party, which had supported their effort to regain their constitutional civil rights.

Most conservative whites gradually left that party and joined the Republican Party. Voting and party affiliation in Clarke County, as throughout much of Alabama, is aligned by ethnicity, with conservative whites, the majority, voting for Republican candidates and African Americans supporting Democratic candidates.

For some positions, white voters have sometimes continued to vote for state-level Democrats, such as Doug Jones in 2017.

<doc id="76956" wikidata="Q210" url="?curid=76956" title="Right angle">
<text>In geometry and trigonometry, a right angle is an angle of exactly 90 degrees or radians corresponding to a quarter turn. If a ray is placed so that its endpoint is on a line and the adjacent angles are equal, then they are right angles. The term is a calque of Latin &quot;angulus rectus&quot;; here &quot;rectus&quot; means &quot;upright&quot;, referring to the vertical perpendicular to a horizontal base line.

Closely related and important geometrical concepts are perpendicular lines, meaning lines that form right angles at their point of intersection, and orthogonality, which is the property of forming right angles, usually applied to vectors. The presence of a right angle in a triangle is the defining factor for right triangles, making the right angle basic to trigonometry.

== Etymology ==
The meaning of &quot;right&quot; in &quot;right angle&quot; possibly refers to the Latin adjective &quot;rectus&quot; &#x27;erect, straight, upright, perpendicular&#x27;. A Greek equivalent is &quot;orthos&quot; &#x27;straight; perpendicular&#x27; (see orthogonality).

== In elementary geometry ==
A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. A square has four right angles, in addition to equal-length sides.

The Pythagorean theorem states how to determine when a triangle is a right triangle.

== Symbols ==

In Unicode, the symbol for a right angle is . It should not be confused with the similarly shaped symbol . Related symbols are , , and .

In diagrams, the fact that an angle is a right angle is usually expressed by adding a small right angle that forms a square with the angle in the diagram, as seen in the diagram of a right triangle (in British English, a right-angled triangle) to the right. The symbol for a measured angle, an arc, with a dot, is used in some European countries, including German-speaking countries and Poland, as an alternative symbol for a right angle.

== Euclid ==
Right angles are fundamental in Euclid&#x27;s Elements. They are defined in Book 1, definition 10, which also defines perpendicular lines. Definition 10 does not use numerical degree measurements but rather touches at the very heart of what a right angle is, namely two straight lines intersecting to form two equal and adjacent angles. The straight lines which form right angles are called perpendicular. Euclid uses right angles in definitions 11 and 12 to define acute angles (those smaller than a right angle) and obtuse angles (those greater than a right angle). Two angles are called complementary if their sum is a right angle.

Book 1 Postulate 4 states that all right angles are equal, which allows Euclid to use a right angle as a unit to measure other angles with. Euclid&#x27;s commentator Proclus gave a proof of this postulate using the previous postulates, but it may be argued that this proof makes use of some hidden assumptions. Saccheri gave a proof as well but using a more explicit assumption. In Hilbert&#x27;s axiomatization of geometry this statement is given as a theorem, but only after much groundwork. One may argue that, even if postulate 4 can be proven from the preceding ones, in the order that Euclid presents his material it is necessary to include it since without it postulate 5, which uses the right angle as a unit of measure, makes no sense.

== Conversion to other units ==
A right angle may be expressed in different units:
* turn
* 90° (degrees)
* radians
* 100 grad (also called &quot;grade&quot;, &quot;gradian&quot;, or &quot;gon&quot;)
* 8 points (of a 32-point compass rose)
* 6 hours (astronomical hour angle)

== Rule of 3-4-5 ==
Throughout history, carpenters and masons have known a quick way to confirm if an angle is a true right angle. It is based on the Pythagorean triple and the rule of 3-4-5. From the angle in question, running a straight line along one side exactly three units in length, and along the second side exactly four units in length, will create a hypotenuse (the longer line opposite the right angle that connects the two measured endpoints) of exactly five units in length.

== Thales&#x27; theorem ==

Thales&#x27; theorem states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle (with a vertex on the semicircle and its defining rays going through the endpoints of the semicircle) is a right angle.

Two application examples in which the right angle and the Thales&#x27; theorem are included (see animations).

== Generalizations ==
The solid angle subtended by an octant of a sphere (the spherical triangle with three right angles) equals /2  sr.

<text>Marcus Aurelius Valerius Maxentius ( 283 – 28 October 312) was a Roman emperor from 306 until his death in 312. Despite ruling in Italy and North Africa, and having the recognition of the Senate in Rome, he was not recognized as a legitimate emperor by his fellow emperors.

He was the son of former Emperor Maximian and the son-in-law of Emperor Galerius. The latter part of his reign was preoccupied with civil war, allying with Maximinus against Licinius and Constantine. The latter defeated him at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312, where Maxentius, with his army in flight, purportedly perished by drowning in the Tiber river.

Maxentius was the last emperor permanently to reside in Rome. He attempted to embellish, restore and improve the ancient capital, carrying out important building works, including the Temple of the Divine Romulus (dedicated to his deceased son), the Basilica of Maxentius, which was completed by Constantine, the villa and the circus of Maxentius.

== Early life, family, and accession ==

=== Early life and family ===

Maxentius was the son of Emperor Maximian and his Syrian wife Eutropia. As his father became emperor in 285, he was regarded as the crown prince who would eventually follow his father on the throne. He seems not to have served, however, in any important military or administrative position during the reign of Diocletian and his father. The exact date of his marriage to Valeria Maximilla, daughter of Galerius, is unknown. He had two sons, Valerius Romulus (ca. 295 – 309) and an unknown one.

In 305, Diocletian and Maximian abdicated, and the former &quot;Caesares&quot; Constantius and Galerius became &quot;Augusti&quot;. Although two sons of emperors – Constantine and Maxentius – were available, they were passed over for the new tetrarchy, and Valerius Severus and Maximinus Daza were appointed Caesars. Lactantius&#x27; &quot;Epitome&quot; states that Galerius hated Maxentius and used his influence with Diocletian to see that Maxentius was ignored in the succession; perhaps Diocletian also thought Maxentius was not qualified for the military duties of the imperial office. Maxentius retired to an estate some miles from Rome.

When Constantius died in 306, his son Constantine was crowned emperor on July 25 and subsequently accepted by Galerius into the Tetrarchy as &quot;Caesar&quot;. This set the precedent for Maxentius&#x27; accession later in the same year.

===Accession===
When rumours reached the capital that the emperors tried to subject the Roman population to the capitation tax, like every other city of the empire, and wanted to dissolve the remnants of the Praetorian Guard which were still stationed at Rome, riots broke out. A group of officers of the city&#x27;s garrisons (Zosimus calls them Marcellianus, Marcellus and Lucianus) turned to Maxentius to accept the imperial purple, probably judging that the official recognition which was granted to Constantine would not be withheld from Maxentius, son of an emperor as well. Maxentius accepted the honour, promised donations to the city&#x27;s troops, and was publicly acclaimed emperor on 28 October 306. The usurpation obviously went largely without bloodshed (Zosimus names only one victim); the prefect of Rome went over to Maxentius and retained his office. Apparently the conspirators turned to Maximian as well, who had retired to a palace in Lucania, but he declined to resume power for the time being.

Maxentius managed to be recognized as emperor in Central Italy and Southern Italy, the islands of Corsica and Sardinia and Sicily, and the African provinces. Northern Italy remained under the control of the western Augustus Valerius Severus, who resided in Mediolanum (Milan).

Maxentius refrained from using the titles &quot;Augustus&quot; or &quot;Caesar&quot; at first and styled himself &quot;princeps invictus&quot; (&quot;undefeated prince&quot;), in the hope of obtaining recognition of his reign by the senior emperor Galerius. However, the latter refused to do so. Apart from his alleged antipathy towards Maxentius, Galerius probably wanted to deter others from following the examples of Constantine and Maxentius and declaring themselves emperors. Constantine firmly controlled his father&#x27;s army and territories, and Galerius could pretend that his accession was part of the regular succession in the tetrarchy, but neither was the case with Maxentius: he would be the fifth emperor, and he had only few troops at his command. Galerius reckoned that it would be not too difficult to quell the usurpation, and early in 307, the Augustus Severus marched on Rome with a large army.

The majority of this army consisted of soldiers who had fought under Maxentius&#x27; father Maximian for years, and as Severus reached Rome, the majority of his army went over to Maxentius and received a large amount of money. When Maximian himself finally left his retreat and returned to Rome to assume the imperial office once again and support his son, Severus with the rest of his army retreated to Ravenna. Shortly after, he surrendered to Maximian, who promised that his life would be spared.

After the defeat of Severus, Maxentius took possession of northern Italy up to the Alps and the Istrian peninsula to the east, and assumed the title of Augustus, which (in his eyes) had become vacant with the surrender of Severus.

==Emperor==

=== Early reign ===
The joint rule of Maxentius and Maximian in Rome was tested further when Galerius marched to Italy in the summer of 307 with an even larger army. While negotiating with the invader, Maxentius could repeat what he did to Severus, by the promise of large sums of money and the authority of Maximian, many soldiers of Galerius defected to him. Galerius was forced to withdraw, plundering Italy on his way. Some time during the invasion, Severus was put to death by Maxentius, probably at Tres Tabernae near Rome (the exact circumstances of his death are not certain). After the failed campaign of Galerius, Maxentius&#x27; reign over Italy and Africa was firmly established. Beginning in 307, he tried to arrange friendly contacts with Constantine and in the summer of that year, Maximian travelled to Gaul, where Constantine married his daughter Fausta and was in turn appointed &quot;Augustus&quot; by the senior emperor. Constantine tried to avoid breaking with Galerius and did not openly support Maxentius during the invasion.

In 308, probably April, Maximian tried to depose his son in an assembly of soldiers in Rome; surprisingly to him, the present troops remained faithful to his son and he had to flee to Constantine. On 20 April, Maxentius proclaimed himself as the new consul of the year, alongside his son Romulus. In the conference of Carnuntum, in the autumn of that same year, Maxentius was once again denied recognition as legitimate emperor, and Licinius was appointed &quot;Augustus&quot; with the task of regaining the lost domains. Late in 308, Domitius Alexander was acclaimed emperor in Carthage, and the African provinces seceded from Maxentian rule. This produced a dangerous situation for Maxentius, as Africa was critical to Rome&#x27;s food supply.
Maxentius&#x27; eldest son Valerius Romulus died in 309, at the age of about fourteen, was deified and buried in a mausoleum in the Villa of Maxentius at the Via Appia. Nearby, Maxentius also constructed the Circus of Maxentius. After the death of Maximian in 309 or 310, relations with Constantine rapidly deteriorated and Maxentius allied with Maximinus to counter an alliance between Constantine and Licinius. He allegedly tried to secure the province of Raetia north of the Alps, thereby dividing the realms of Constantine and Licinius (reported by Zosimus); the plan was not carried out, as Constantine acted first.

In 310, Maxentius lost Istria to Licinius, who could not continue the campaign. By the middle of 310 Galerius had become too ill to involve himself in imperial politics and he died soon after 30 April 311. Galerius&#x27; death destabilized what remained of the Tetrarchic system. On hearing the news, Maximinus mobilized against Licinius and seized Asia Minor before meeting Licinius on the Bosphorus to arrange terms for peace. In the meantime, Maxentius fortified northern Italy against potential invasions and sent a small army to Africa under the command of his praetorian prefect Rufius Volusianus which defeated and executed the usurper Domitius Alexander in 310 or 311. Maxentius used the opportunity to seize the wealth of his supporters, and to bring large amounts of grain to Rome. He also strengthened his support among the Christians of Italy by allowing them to elect a new Bishop of Rome, Eusebius.
Maxentius was far from secure, his early support dissolving into open protest; by 312, he was a man barely tolerated. Without the revenues of the empire, Maxentius was forced to resume taxation in Italy to support his army and his building projects in Rome. The election of a bishop did not aid much, either, as Diocletian&#x27;s persecution had split the Italian church into competing factions over the issue of apostasy (see Donatism). The Christians of Italy could easily see that Constantine was more sympathetic to their plight than Maxentius. In the summer of 311, Maxentius mobilized against Constantine while Licinius was occupied with affairs in the East. He declared war on Constantine, vowing to avenge his father&#x27;s &quot;murder&quot;. Constantine, to prevent Maxentius from forming a hostile alliance with Licinius, forged his own alliance with the man over the winter of 311–12 by offering to him his sister Constantia in marriage. Maximinus Daza considered Constantine&#x27;s arrangement with Licinius an affront to his authority. In response, he sent ambassadors to Rome, offering political recognition to Maxentius in exchange for military support. Two alliances, Maximinus and Maxentius, Constantine and Licinius, lined up against one another. The emperors prepared for war.

===War against Constantine===

==== Verona ====
Maxentius expected an attack along his eastern flank from Licinius and stationed an army in Verona. Constantine had smaller forces than his opponent: with his forces withdrawn from Africa, with the praetorian and Imperial Horse Guard, and with the troops he had taken from Severus, Maxentius had an army equal to approximately 100,000 soldiers to use against his opponents in the north. Many of these he used to garrison fortified towns across the region, keeping most stationed with him in Verona. Against this, Constantine could only bring a force of between twenty-five and forty thousand men. The bulk of his troops simply could not be withdrawn from the Rhine frontiers without negative consequences. It was against the recommendations of his advisers and generals, against popular expectation, that Constantine anticipated Maxentius, and struck first.

==== Turin ====
As early as weather permitted, late in the spring of 312, Constantine crossed the Alps with a quarter of his army, a force equivalent to something less than forty thousand men. Having crossed the Cottian Alps at the Mont Cenis pass, he first came to Segusium (Susa, Italy), a heavily fortified town containing a military garrison, which shut its gates to him. Constantine ordered his forces to set its gates on fire and scale its walls, and took the town quickly. Constantine forbade the plunder of the town and advanced into northern Italy.

At the approach to the west of the important city of Augusta Taurinorum (Turin, Italy), Constantine encountered a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry, labeled &quot;clibanarii&quot; or &quot;cataphracti&quot; in the ancient sources. In the ensuing battle Constantine spread his forces into a line, allowing Maxentius&#x27; cavalry to ride into the middle of his forces. As his forces broadly encircled the enemy cavalry, Constantine&#x27;s own cavalry charged at the sides of the Maxentian cataphracts, beating them with iron-tipped clubs. Many Maxentian cavalrymen were dismounted, while most others were variously incapacitated by the blows. Constantine then commanded his foot soldiers to advance against the surviving Maxentian infantry, cutting them down as they fled. Victory, the panegyrist who speaks of the events declares, came easily. Turin refused to give refuge to the retreating forces of Maxentius. It opened its gates to Constantine instead. Other cities of the north Italian plain, recognizing Constantine&#x27;s quick and clement victories, sent him embassies of congratulation for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. He resided there until the middle of the summer of 312 before moving on.

==== Milvian bridge ====
It was expected that Maxentius would try the same strategy as against Severus and Galerius earlier; that is, remaining in the well-defended city of Rome, and sit out a siege which would cost his enemy much more. For somewhat uncertain reasons, he abandoned this plan, however, and offered battle to Constantine near the Milvian Bridge on 28 October 312. Ancient sources usually attribute this action to superstition or (if pro-Constantinian) divine providence. Maxentius of course had consulted soothsayers before battle, as was customary practice, and it can be assumed that they reported favourable omens, especially as the day of battle would be his &quot;dies imperii&quot;, the day of his accession to the throne (which was 28 October 306). What else may have motivated him is open to speculation.

The armies of Maxentius and Constantine met north of the city, some distance outside the walls, beyond the Tiber river on the Via Flaminia. Christian tradition, especially Lactantius and Eusebius of Caesarea, claims that Constantine fought under the labarum in that battle, revealed to him in a dream. Of the battle itself, not much is known – Constantine&#x27;s forces defeated Maxentius&#x27;s troops, who retreated to the Tiber, and in the chaos of the fleeing army trying to cross the river, Maxentius fell into the water and drowned. His body was found the next day and paraded through the city, and later sent to Africa, as a sign that he had surely perished. Maxentius&#x27; entire family, including his two orphaned children, were also executed.

==Overview and legacy==
Studies conducted between 2021 and 2022 have made it possible to identify the manuscript tradition of Maxentius&#x27; epistles, which have undergone numerous interpolations and attempts of forgery to adapt the texts to a pro-Constantinian hagiographic narrative (Passio of Saint Catherine).
A comparison with Roman law, legal papyri and the primary sources such as Diocletian&#x27;s Senateconsult and edict of persecution has allowed an integrated critical reconstruction of the original texts, which perfectly mirrors what Eusebius of Caesarea, Optatus of Milevi and Saint Augustine report about Maxentius&#x27; pro-Christian policy.
According to these new documents found in the Biblioteca Marciana of Venice, we learn that Maxentius ended the Great Persecution in his territories at least five years in advance of the Edict of Milan:

1- made Christianity a licit religion welcoming the &quot;New Gods&quot; in the Pax Deorum (Epistle 1)

2- abolished the edict of persecution of Diocletian by law (Epistle 1)

3- threatens serious punishments for anyone persisting in the persecution of Christians (Epistle 1)

4- He raged against the Donatist sect in Africa, reaffirming its strategic alliance with the Church of Rome (Epistle 2)

The Diocletianic Persecutions extended from 303 to 311 in all territories of the Empire, except at this point those under the jurisdiction of Maxentius the Roman empire&#x27;s last, largest, and bloodiest official persecution of Christianity. 
Constantine came to power in 311 after defeating Maxentius at the Milvian bridge, where Maxentius drowned.

Maxentius was a prolific builder, whose achievements were overshadowed by Constantine&#x27;s issue of a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; against him. Many buildings in Rome that are commonly associated with Constantine, such as the great basilica in the forum Romanum, were in fact built by Maxentius.

===Discovery of Imperial insignia===
In December 2006, Italian archaeologists announced that an excavation under a shrine near the Palatine Hill had unearthed several items in wooden boxes, which they identified as the imperial &quot;regalia&quot;, possibly belonging to Maxentius. The items in these boxes, which were wrapped in linen and what appears to be silk, include three complete lances, four javelins, what appears to be a base for standards, and three glass and chalcedony spheres. The most important find was a sceptre of a flower holding a blue-green globe, which is believed to have belonged to the Emperor himself because of its intricate workmanship, and has been dated to his rule.

These are the only known imperial insignia so far recovered, which hitherto had only been known from representations on coins and in relief sculptures. Clementina Panella, the archaeologist who made the discovery, states that &quot;These artifacts clearly belonged to the emperor, especially the sceptre, which is very elaborate. It&#x27;s not an item you would let someone else have.&quot; Panella notes that the insignia were likely hidden by Maxentius&#x27; supporters in an attempt to preserve the emperor&#x27;s memory after he was defeated at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge by Constantine. The items have been restored and are on temporary display at the Museo Nazionale Romano at the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme.

<text>Quercus palustris, also called pin oak, swamp oak, or Spanish oak, is a tree in the red oak section (&quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Lobatae&quot;) of the genus &quot;Quercus&quot;. Pin oak is one of the most commonly used landscaping oaks in its native range due to its ease of transplant, relatively fast growth, and pollution tolerance.

==Description==
Quercus palustris is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to tall, with a trunk up to in diameter. It has an spread. A 10-year-old tree grown in full sun will be about tall. Young trees have a straight, columnar trunk with smooth bark and a pyramidal canopy.

By the time the tree is 40 years old, it develops more rough bark with a loose, spreading canopy. This canopy is considered one of the most distinctive features of the pin oak: the upper branches point upwards, the middle branches are at right angles to the trunk, and the lower branches droop downwards.

The leaves are long and broad, lobed, with five or seven lobes. Each lobe has five to seven bristle-tipped teeth. The sinuses are typically U-shaped and extremely deep cut. In fact, roughly the same amount of sinus area exists as actual leaf area. The leaf is mostly hairless, except for a very characteristic tuft of pale orange-brown down on the lower surface where each lobe vein joins the central vein. Overall autumn leaf coloration is generally bronze, though individual leaves may be red for a time, and is not considered particularly distinctive. The acorns, borne in a shallow, thin cap, are hemispherical, long and broad, green maturing pale brown about 18 months after pollination. Unless processed using traditional methods, the acorn is unpalatable because the kernel is very bitter.

In its natural environment pin oak is a relatively short-lived, fast-growing pioneer or riparian species with a lifespan of approximately 120 years against many oaks which can live several centuries. Despite this there are many examples of pin oak that exceed this lifespan. It develops a shallow, fibrous root system, unlike many oaks, which have a strong, deep taproot when young.

A characteristic shared by a few other oak species, and also some beeches and hornbeams, is the retention of leaves through the winter on juvenile trees, a natural phenomenon referred to as marcescence. Young trees under are often covered with leaves year-round, though the leaves die in the fall, remaining attached to the shoots until the new leaves appear in the spring. As with many other oak species, dead pin oak branches stay on the tree for many years.

=== Flowering and fruiting ===
Like all oaks, flowering and leaf-out occur in late spring when all frost danger has passed. The flowers are monoecious catkins which, being self-incompatible, require the presence of another oak for pollination. Any species in the red oak group can serve as a pollinator, but in pin oak&#x27;s natural range, this will usually be northern red oak or scarlet oak. Interspecies hybridization occurs freely. The acorns require two growing seasons to develop.

==Name==
The Latin specific epithet &quot;palustris&quot; means &quot;of marshland&quot; or &quot;of swamps&quot;, referring to its natural habitat.

The common name &quot;pin oak&quot; is possibly due to the many small, slender twigs, but may also be from the historical use of the hard wood for pins in wooden building construction.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Q. palustris&quot; is mainly distributed in the eastern and central United States from Connecticut in the northeast, west to eastern Oklahoma and Kansas, and south to Georgia. It is also native in the extreme south of Ontario, Canada.

The pin oak is also well adapted to life in Australia (where it has been introduced), and is quite widespread across the Australian continent, especially in the cooler southern States such as Victoria and New South Wales. It is also well adapted to life in South Africa and Argentina, especially in the Río de la Plata region.

It is naturally a wetland tree, confined to acidic soils, and does not tolerate limestone or sandy Florida soil, and grows at low altitudes from sea level up to .

It grows primarily on level or nearly level, poorly drained, alluvial floodplain and river-bottom soils with high clay content. They are usually found on sites that flood intermittently during the dormant season, but do not ordinarily flood during the growing season. They do not grow on the lowest, most poorly drained sites that may be covered with standing water through much of the growing season. However, they do grow extensively on poorly drained upland &quot;pin oak flats&quot; on the glacial till plains of southwestern Ohio, southern Illinois and Indiana, and northern Missouri. The level topography and presence of a claypan in the soil of these areas cause these sites to be excessively wet in winter and spring.

==Ecology==
=== Associated forest cover ===

Pin oak is a major species in only one forest cover type, pin oak–sweetgum, which is found on bottom lands and some upland sites throughout the central portion of the pin oak range. Pin oak and sweetgum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;) vary in their relative proportions in this cover type. Large areas of almost pure pin oak occur on the &quot;pin oak flats&quot; of the upland glacial till plains or in the bottom lands of the lower Ohio and central Mississippi River valleys. Associated species in this forest type include red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;), American elm (&quot;Ulmus americana&quot;), black tupelo (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;), swamp white oak (&quot;Quercus bicolor&quot;), willow oak (&quot;Quercus phellos&quot;), overcup oak (&quot;Quercus lyrata&quot;), bur oak (&quot;Quercus macrocarpa&quot;), green ash (&quot;Fraxinus pennsylvanica&quot;), Nuttall&#x27;s oak (&quot;Quercus texana&quot;), swamp chestnut oak (&quot;Quercus michauxii&quot;), and shellbark (&quot;Carya laciniosa&quot;) and shagbark (&quot;Carya ovata&quot;) hickories.

Pin oak is an associated species in silver maple–American elm forests in the bottom lands along the Ohio, Wabash, Mississippi, and Missouri Rivers. A variant of this type, silver maple–American elm–pin oak–sweetgum, is found along major streams in southern Illinois and Indiana.

Pin oak also occurs in black ash–American elm–red maple forests in poorly drained bottom lands in northern Ohio and Indiana along with silver maple (&quot;Acer saccharinum&quot;), swamp white oak, sycamore (&quot;Platanus occidentalis&quot;), black tupelo, and eastern cottonwood (&quot;Populus deltoides&quot;).

=== Reaction to competition ===
Pin oak is classed as intolerant of shade. It is less tolerant than elm, boxelder &quot;(Acer negundo)&quot;, sweetgum, hackberry &quot;(Celtis occidentalis)&quot;, and ash, but is more tolerant than eastern cottonwood and black willow. Pin oak usually grows in even-aged stands of dominant and co-dominant trees. Intermediate and suppressed trees in such stands usually die within a few years of being overtopped. Single pin oaks in mixed stands usually are dominants. Pin oak is considered a subclimax species. It persists on heavy, wet soils because it produces an abundance of acorns which, if released, grow faster on these sites than most of its competitors.

=== Damaging agents ===
Although pin oak is very tolerant of dormant-season flooding, it is much less tolerant of growing-season flooding. Trees may be injured or killed by intermittent growing-season flooding over several successive years. The trees can usually survive one growing season of continuous flooding, but will be killed by continuous flooding over 2 or 3 consecutive years. Pin oak is rated as &quot;intermediately tolerant&quot; to growing-season flooding. Also, since the bark of pin oak is relatively thin, the species is especially susceptible to damage by fire and decay associated with fire wounds.

=== Associated species ===
Due to similarity in leaf shape, the pin oak is often confused with scarlet oak and black oak, and occasionally, red oak. However, it can be distinguished by its distinctive dead branches on the lower trunk (&quot;pins&quot;), and its uniquely shaped crown. The sinuses on pin oak leaves are also deeply cut, often covering just as much area as the leaf itself.

The pin oak is the only known food plant of &quot;Bucculatrix domicola&quot; caterpillars.

==Uses==
In its native range, pin oak is the most commonly used landscaping oak along with northern red oak due to its ease of transplant, relatively fast growth, and pollution tolerance. However, as it is naturally adapted to moist, acidic soils, it may develop a condition known as iron chlorosis on less suitable locations, causing the tree to shed leaves during the growing season and rot from the top down. Mature pin oaks are often too big to treat and this nutrient deficiency on alkaline soil may eventually kill them. The drooping lower branches can also be a problem, interfering with access for traffic and pedestrians.

It is also cultivated in parks and large gardens in the United Kingdom, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

The wood is generally marketed as red oak, but is of significantly inferior quality, being somewhat weaker, often with many small knots. The wood is hard and heavy and is used in general construction and for firewood. The bark was used by some Native American tribes to make a drink for treatment of intestinal pain.

<text>The Royal Abbey of Our Lady of Fontevraud or Fontevrault (in French: &quot;abbaye de Fontevraud&quot;) was a monastery in the village of Fontevraud-l&#x27;Abbaye, near Chinon, in the former French Duchy of Anjou. It was founded in 1101 by the itinerant preacher Robert of Arbrissel. The foundation flourished and became the centre of a new monastic Order, the Order of Fontevraud. This order was composed of double monasteries, in which the community consisted of both men and women — in separate quarters of the abbey — all of whom were subject to the authority of the Abbess of Fontevraud. The Abbey of Fontevraud itself consisted of four separate communities, all managed by the same abbess.

The first permanent structures were built between 1110 and 1119. The area where the Abbey is located was then part of what is sometimes referred to as the Angevin Empire. The king of England, Henry II, his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and their son, King Richard the Lionheart, were all buried here at the end of the 12th century. It was seized and disestablished as a monastery during the French Revolution.

The Abbey is situated in the Loire Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, between Chalonnes-sur-Loire and Sully-sur-Loire within the Loire-Anjou-Touraine French regional natural park (&quot;Parc naturel régional Loire-Anjou-Touraine&quot;).

The complex of monastic buildings served as a prison from 1804 to 1963. Since 1975, it has hosted a cultural centre, the Centre Culturel de l&#x27;Ouest.

==History==

===Founder===


Robert of Arbrissel had served as the Archpriest of the Diocese of Rennes, carrying out the reformist agenda of its bishop. When the bishop died in 1095, Robert was driven out of the diocese due to the hostility of the local clergy. He then became a hermit in the forest of Craon, where he practiced a life of severe penance, together with a number of other men who went on to found major monastic institutions. His eloquence and asceticism attracted many followers, for whom in 1096 he founded a monastery of canons regular at La Roë, of which he was the first abbot. In that same year Pope Urban II summoned him to Angers and appointed him an apostolic missionary, authorizing him to preach anywhere. His preaching drew large crowds of devoted followers, both men and women, even lepers. As a result, many men wished to embrace the religious life, and he sent these to his abbey. When the canons of that house objected to the influx of candidates of lower social states, he resigned his office and left the community.

===Fontevraud===

Around 1100 Robert and his followers settled in a valley called &quot;Fons Ebraldi&quot; where he established a monastic community. Initially the men and women lived together in the same house, in an ancient ascetic practice called Syneisaktism. This practice had been widely condemned by Church authorities, however, and under pressure the community soon segregated according to gender, with the monks living in small priories where they lived in community in service to the nuns and under their rule. Sometime before 1106, Fulk IV, Count of Anjou gave a significant property gift to the abbey.

They were recognized as a religious community in 1106, both by the Bishop of Angers and by Pope Paschal II. Robert, who soon resumed his life of itinerant preaching, appointed Hersende of Champagne to lead the community. Later her assistant, Petronilla of Chemillé, was elected as the first abbess in 1115.

Robert wrote a brief Rule of Life for the community, based upon the Rule of St. Benedict. Unlike the other monastic orders characterized by double monasteries, the monks and nuns of the Order of Fontevrault followed the same Rule. In his Rule, Robert dealt with four principal points: silence, good works, food and clothing, encouraging the utmost in simplicity of life and dress. He directed that the abbess should never be chosen from among those who had been brought up at Fontevrault, but that she should be someone who had had experience of the world (&quot;de conversis sororibus&quot;). This latter injunction was observed only in the case of the first two abbesses and was canceled by Pope Innocent III in 1201. At the time of Robert&#x27;s death in 1117, there were about 3,000 nuns in the community.
In the early years the Plantagenets were great benefactors of the abbey and while Isabella d&#x27;Anjou was the abbess, King Henry II&#x27;s widow, Eleanor of Aquitaine, made the abbey her place of residence. Abbess Louise de Bourbon left her crest on many of the alterations to the abbey building which she made during her term of office.
===Decline===
With the passing of the Plantagenet dynasty, Fontevrault and her dependencies began to fall upon hard times. At the end of the 12th century, the Abbess of Fontevrault, Matilda of Flanders (1189–1194), complained about the extreme poverty which the abbey was suffering. As a result, in 1247 the nuns were permitted to receive inheritances to provide income for their needs, contrary to monastic custom. The fragile economic basis of the Order was exacerbated by the devastation of the Hundred Years War, which lasted throughout the 14th century. A canonical visitation of fifty of the priories of the Order in 1460 showed most of them to be barely occupied, if not abandoned.

===Later history and suppression===

Due to financial pressures the youngest four of the six daughters of Louis XV were sent to the abbey to be raised. Each was brought up at the abbey until the age of 15.

The Order was dispersed during the French Revolution. In November 1789, all property of the Catholic Church in France was declared to be the property of the nation. On 17 August 1792, a Revolutionary decree ordered evacuation of all monasteries, to be completed by 1 October 1792. At that time, there were still some 200 nuns and a small community of monks in residence at Fontevraud. The last abbess, Julie Sophie Charlotte de Pardaillan d&#x27;Antin, is said to have died in poverty in Paris in 1797. The abbey became a prison in 1804.

The prison was planned to hold 1,000 prisoners and the former abbey required major changes, including new barracks in addition to the transformation of monastic buildings into dormitories, workshops, and common areas. Prisoners—men, women and children—began arriving in 1814. Eventually it held some 2,000 prisoners, earning the prison the reputation of being the &quot;toughest in France after Clairvaux&quot; (also a former abbey). Political prisoners were subjected to the harshest conditions. Under the Vichy Government, some French Resistance prisoners were shot there.

In 1963 it was given to the French Ministry of Culture, and a major restoration was undertaken. In 1975 the Centre culturel de l&#x27;Ouest was formed to preserve the abbey and promote it as a cultural venue. The complex was opened to the public in 1985. Restoration of the abbey church according to the earlier restoration under the architect Lucien Magne was completed in 2006.

The order was revived by Mme Rose in 1806 as one for women only and following a modified rule.

The abbey was originally the site of the graves of King Henry II of England, his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, their son King Richard I of England, their daughter Joan, their grandson Raymond VII of Toulouse, and Isabella of Angoulême, wife of Henry and Eleanor&#x27;s son King John. However, there is no remaining corporal presence of Henry, Eleanor, Richard, or the others on the site. Their remains were possibly destroyed during the French Revolution. The bodies of the French monarchs were likewise removed from the Basilica of St Denis in 1793 by order of the French government.

Henriette Louise de Bourbon, granddaughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, grew up here. Princess Thérèse of France, daughter of Louis XV, is also buried here.

Jean Genet described the experiences of a thirty-year-old prisoner at Fontevraud in his semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;Miracle de la rose&quot;, although there is no evidence that Genet was ever imprisoned there himself.

&quot;La Cage aux Rossignols&quot; (&quot;A Cage of Nightingales&quot;), a French film released in 1945, was filmed at the abbey.

<text>Denmark is a Nordic country in Northern Europe. It is the metropole and most populous constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark, also known as the Danish Realm, a constitutionally unitary state that includes the autonomous territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland in the north Atlantic Ocean. Metropolitan Denmark, also called &quot;continental Denmark&quot; or &quot;Denmark proper&quot;, consists of the northern Jutland peninsula and an archipelago of 406 islands. It is the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries, lying southwest of Sweden, south of Norway, and north of Germany, with which it shares a short border. Denmark proper is situated between the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the east.

The Kingdom of Denmark, including the Faroe Islands and Greenland, has roughly 1,400 islands greater than in area; 443 have been named and 78 are inhabited. Denmark&#x27;s population is close to 6 million, of which roughly 40% live in Zealand, the largest and most populated island in Denmark proper; Copenhagen, the capital and largest city of the Danish Realm, is situated on Zealand and Amager. Composed mostly of flat, arable land, Denmark is characterised by sandy coasts, low elevation, and a temperate climate. Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving powers to the other constituent entities to handle their internal affairs. Home rule was established in the Faroe Islands in 1948; Greenland achieved home rule in 1979 and further autonomy in 2009.

The unified Kingdom of Denmark emerged in the eighth century AD as a maritime power amid the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. In 1397, it formed the Kalmar Union with Norway and Sweden. This union persisted until Sweden&#x27;s secession in 1523. The remaining Kingdom of Denmark–Norway endured a series of wars in the 17th century that resulted in further territorial cessions. A surge of nationalist movements in the 19th century were defeated in the First Schleswig War of 1848. The adoption of the Constitution of Denmark on 5 June 1849 ended the absolute monarchy and introduced the current parliamentary system. 

Denmark began industrialising in the mid 19th century, becoming a major agricultural exporter. It introduced social and labour market reforms in the early 20th century, forming the basis for the present welfare state model and advanced mixed economy. Denmark remained neutral during World War I; Danish neutrality was violated in World War II by a rapid German invasion in April 1940. During occupation, a resistance movement emerged in 1943, while Iceland declared independence in 1944; Denmark was liberated after the end of the war in May 1945. In 1973, Denmark, together with Greenland but not the Faroe Islands, became a member of what is now the European Union; however, it negotiated certain opt-outs, such as retaining its own currency, the krone. 

Denmark is a developed country with an advanced high-income economy, high standard of living, and robust social welfare policies. Danish culture and society are broadly progressive egalitarian, and socially liberal; Denmark was the first country to legally recognise same-sex partnerships. It is a founding member of NATO, the Nordic Council, the OECD, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the United Nations, and is part of the Schengen Area. Denmark maintains close political, cultural, and linguistic ties with its Scandinavian neighbours. The Danish political system, which emphasizes broad consensus, is used by American political scientist, Francis Fukuyama, as a reference point for near-perfect governance; his phrase &quot;getting to Denmark&quot; refers to the country&#x27;s status as a global model for social and political institutions.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name &quot;Denmark&quot;, the relationship between &quot;Danes&quot; and &quot;Denmark&quot;, and the emergence of Denmark as a unified kingdom are topics of continuous scholarly debate. This is centred primarily on the morpheme &quot;Dan&quot; and whether it refers to the Dani or a historical person Dan and the exact meaning of the -&quot;mark&quot; ending.

Most etymological dictionaries and handbooks derive &quot;Dan&quot; from a word meaning &quot;flat land&quot;, related to German &quot;threshing floor&quot;, English &quot;den&quot; &quot;cave&quot;. The element &quot;mark&quot; is believed to mean woodland or borderland (see marches), with probable references to the border forests in south Schleswig.

The first recorded use of the word &quot;Danmark&quot; within Denmark itself is found on the two Jelling stones, which are runestones believed to have been erected by Gorm the Old () and Harald Bluetooth (). The larger of the two stones is popularly cited as the &quot;baptismal certificate&quot; () of Denmark, though both use the word &quot;Denmark&quot;, in the accusative () on the large stone, and the genitive &quot;tanmarkar&quot; (pronounced ) on the small stone, while the dative form &quot;tąnmarku&quot; (pronounced ) is found on the contemporaneous Skivum stone. The inhabitants of Denmark are there called (), or &quot;Danes&quot;, in the accusative.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
The earliest archaeological finds in Denmark date back to the Eem interglacial period from 130,000 to 110,000 BC. Denmark has been inhabited since around 12,500 BC and agriculture has been evident since 3900 BC. The Nordic Bronze Age (1800–600 BC) in Denmark was marked by burial mounds, which left an abundance of findings including lurs and the Sun Chariot.

During the Pre-Roman Iron Age (500 BC – AD 1), native groups began migrating south, and the first tribal Danes came to the country between the Pre-Roman and the Germanic Iron Age, in the Roman Iron Age (AD 1–400). The Roman provinces maintained trade routes and relations with native tribes in Denmark, and Roman coins have been found in Denmark. Evidence of strong Celtic cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of North-West Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the Gundestrup cauldron.

The tribal Danes came from the east Danish islands (Zealand) and Scania and spoke an early form of North Germanic. Historians believe that before their arrival, most of Jutland and the nearest islands were settled by tribal Jutes. Many Jutes migrated to Great Britain, according to legend some as mercenaries of Brythonic King Vortigern, and formed the south-eastern territories of Kent, the Isle of Wight and other areas, where they settled. They were later absorbed or ethnically cleansed by the invading Angles and Saxons, who formed the Anglo-Saxons. The remaining Jutish population in Jutland assimilated in with the settling Danes.

A short note about the &quot;Dani&quot; in &quot;Getica&quot; by the historian Jordanes is believed to be an early mention of the Danes, one of the ethnic groups from whom modern Danes are descended. The Danevirke defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in AD 737 are attributed to the emergence of a Danish king. A new runic alphabet was first used around the same time and Ribe, the oldest town of Denmark, was founded about AD 700.

=== Viking and Middle Ages ===


From the 8th to the 10th century the wider Scandinavian region was the source of Vikings. They colonised, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. The Danish Vikings were most active in the eastern and southern British Isles and Western Europe. They settled in parts of England (known as the Danelaw) under King Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013, and in France where Danes and Norwegians were allowed to settle in what would become Normandy in exchange of allegiance to Robert I of France with Rollo as first ruler. Some Anglo-Saxon pence of this period have been found in Denmark.

Denmark was largely consolidated by the late 8th century and its rulers are consistently referred to in Frankish sources as kings (&quot;reges&quot;). Under the reign of Gudfred in 804 the Danish kingdom may have included all the lands of Jutland, Scania and the Danish islands, excluding Bornholm.

The extant Danish monarchy traces its roots back to Gorm the Old, who established his reign in the early 10th century. As attested by the Jelling stones, the Danes were Christianised around 965 by Harald Bluetooth, the son of Gorm and Thyra. It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the Holy Roman Empire. A rising Christian power in Europe, the Holy Roman Empire was an important trading partner for the Danes. As a deterrent against this threat, Harald built six fortresses around Denmark called Trelleborg and built a further Danevirke. In the early 11th century, Canute the Great won and united Denmark, England, and Norway for almost 30 years with a Scandinavian army.

Throughout the High and Late Middle Ages, Denmark also included Skåneland (the areas of Scania, Halland, and Blekinge in present-day south Sweden) and Danish kings ruled Danish Estonia, as well as the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Most of the latter two now form the state of Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany.

In 1397, Denmark entered into a personal union known as the Kalmar Union with Norway and Sweden, united under Queen Margaret I. The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union. However, even from the start, Margaret may not have been so idealistic—treating Denmark as the clear &quot;senior&quot; partner of the union. Thus, much of the next 125 years of Scandinavian history revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly. The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as Swedish King Gustav Vasa conquered the city of Stockholm. The Protestant Reformation spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the Count&#x27;s Feud civil war, Denmark converted to Lutheranism in 1536. Later that year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway.

=== Early modern history (1536–1849) ===


After Sweden permanently broke away from the personal union, Denmark tried on several occasions to reassert control over its neighbour. King Christian IV attacked Sweden in the 1611–1613 Kalmar War but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the union. The war led to no territorial changes, but Sweden was forced to pay a war indemnity of 1 million silver riksdaler to Denmark, an amount known as the &quot;Älvsborg ransom&quot;. King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses, most notably Glückstadt (founded as a rival to Hamburg) and Christiania. Inspired by the Dutch East India Company, he founded a similar Danish company and planned to claim Ceylon as a colony, but the company only managed to acquire Tranquebar on India&#x27;s Coromandel Coast. Denmark&#x27;s large colonial aspirations included a few key trading posts in Africa and India. While Denmark&#x27;s trading posts in India were of little note, it played an important role in the highly lucrative Atlantic slave trade, through its trading outposts in Fort Christiansborg in Osu, Ghana through which 1.5 million slaves were traded. While the Danish colonial empire was sustained by trade with other major powers, and plantations – ultimately a lack of resources led to its stagnation.

In the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Christian tried to become the leader of the Lutheran states in Germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Lutter. The result was that the Catholic army under Albrecht von Wallenstein was able to invade, occupy, and pillage Jutland, forcing Denmark to withdraw from the war. Denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions, but King Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; intervention in Germany was seen as a sign that the military power of Sweden was on the rise while Denmark&#x27;s influence in the region was declining. Swedish armies invaded Jutland in 1643 and claimed Scania in 1644. In the 1645 Treaty of Brømsebro, Denmark surrendered Halland, Gotland, the last parts of Danish Estonia, and several provinces in Norway.

Seeing an opportunity to tear up the Treaty of Brømsebro, King Frederick III of Denmark, in 1657, declared war on Sweden, the latter being deeply involved in the Second Northern War (1655–1660), and marched on Bremen-Verden. This led to a massive Danish defeat as the armies of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden conquered Jutland and, following the Swedish March across the frozen Danish straits, occupied Funen and much of Zealand before signing the Peace of Roskilde in February 1658, which gave Sweden control of Scania, Blekinge, Bohuslän, Trøndelag, and the island of Bornholm. Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having ruined Denmark and in August 1658, he launched a second attack on Denmark, conquered most of the Danish islands, and began a two-year-long siege of Copenhagen. King Frederick III actively led the defence of the city, rallying its citizens to take up arms, and repelled the Swedish attacks. The siege ended following the death of Charles X Gustav in 1660. In the ensuing peace settlement, Denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Trøndelag and Bornholm. Attaining great popularity following the war, Frederick III used this to disband the elective monarchy in favour of absolute monarchy, which lasted until 1848 in Denmark.

Denmark tried but failed to regain control of Scania in the Scanian War (1675–1679). After the Great Northern War (1700–21), Denmark managed to regain control of the parts of Schleswig and Holstein ruled by the house of Holstein-Gottorp in the 1720 Treaty of Frederiksborg and the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo, respectively. Denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the 18th century due to its neutral status allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars. In the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark traded with both France and the United Kingdom and joined the League of Armed Neutrality with Russia, Sweden, and Prussia. British fears that Denmark-Norway would ally with France led to two attacks against Danish targets in Copenhagen in 1801 and 1807. These attacks resulted in the British capturing most of the Dano-Norwegian navy and led to the outbreak of the Gunboat War. British control of the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the union&#x27;s economy and in 1813 Denmark–Norway went bankrupt.

The union was dissolved by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814; the Danish monarchy &quot;irrevocably and forever&quot; renounced claims to the Kingdom of Norway in favour of the Swedish king. Denmark kept the possessions of Iceland (which retained the Danish monarchy until 1944), the Faroe Islands and Greenland, all of which had been governed by Norway for centuries. Apart from the Nordic colonies, Denmark continued to rule over Danish India from 1620 to 1869, the Danish Gold Coast (Ghana) from 1658 to 1850, and the Danish West Indies from 1671 to 1917.

=== Constitutional monarchy (1849–present) ===
A nascent Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s; after the European Revolutions of 1848, Denmark peacefully became a constitutional monarchy on 5 June 1849. A new constitution established a two-chamber parliament. Denmark faced war against both Prussia and the Austrian Empire in what became known as the Second Schleswig War, lasting from February to October 1864. Denmark was defeated and obliged to cede Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia. This loss came as the latest in the long series of defeats and territorial losses that had begun in the 17th century. After these events, Denmark pursued a policy of neutrality in Europe.

Industrialisation came to Denmark in the second half of the 19th century. The nation&#x27;s first railways were constructed in the 1850s, and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of Denmark&#x27;s lack of natural resources. Trade unions developed, starting in the 1870s. There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and Danish agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products.

Denmark maintained its neutral stance during World War I. After the defeat of Germany, the Versailles powers offered to return the region of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. Fearing German irredentism, Denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a plebiscite; the two Schleswig Plebiscites took place on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively. On 10 July 1920, Northern Schleswig was recovered by Denmark, thereby adding some 163,600 inhabitants and . The country&#x27;s first social democratic government took office in 1924.

In 1939, Denmark signed a 10-year nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany. However, Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940, and the Danish government quickly surrendered. World War II in Denmark was characterised by economic co-operation with Germany until 1943, when the Danish government refused further co-operation and its navy scuttled most of its ships and sent many of its officers to Sweden, which was neutral. The Danish resistance performed a rescue operation that managed to evacuate several thousand Jews and their families to safety in Sweden before the Germans could send them to death camps. Some Danes supported Nazism by joining the Danish Nazi Party or volunteering to fight with Germany as part of the Frikorps Danmark. Iceland severed ties with Denmark and became an independent republic in 1944; Germany surrendered in May 1945. In 1948, the Faroe Islands gained home rule. In 1949, Denmark became a founding member of NATO.

Denmark was a founding member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). During the 1960s, the EFTA countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven, as opposed to the Inner Six of what was then the European Economic Community (EEC). In 1973, along with Britain and Ireland, Denmark joined the European Economic Community (now the European Union) after a public referendum. The Maastricht Treaty, which involved further European integration, was rejected by the Danish people in 1992; it was only accepted after a second referendum in 1993, which provided for four opt-outs from policies. The Danes rejected the euro as the national currency in a referendum in 2000. Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded self-determination in 2009. Neither the Faroe Islands nor Greenland are members of the European Union, the Faroese having declined membership of the EEC in 1973 and Greenland in 1986, in both cases because of fisheries policies.

Constitutional change in 1953 led to a single-chamber parliament elected by proportional representation, female accession to the Danish throne, and Greenland becoming an integral part of Denmark. The centre-left Social Democrats led a string of coalition governments for most of the second half of the 20th century, introducing the Nordic welfare model. The Liberal Party and the Conservative People&#x27;s Party have also led centre-right governments.

== Geography ==

Located in Northern Europe, Denmark consists of the northern part of the Jutland peninsula and an archipelago of 406 islands. Of these, the largest island is Zealand, on which the capital Copenhagen is situated, followed by the North Jutlandic Island, Funen, and Lolland. The island of Bornholm is located some 150 km east of the rest of the country, in the Baltic Sea. Many of the larger islands are connected by bridges; a bridge-tunnel across the Øresund connects Zealand with Sweden; the Great Belt Fixed Link connects Funen with Zealand; and the Little Belt Bridge connects Jutland with Funen. Ferries or small aircraft connect to the smaller islands. The four cities with populations over 100,000 are the capital Copenhagen on Zealand; Aarhus and Aalborg in Jutland; and Odense on Funen.

The metropolitan part occupies a total area of . The area of inland water is . The size of the land area cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline, and because of human land reclamation projects (to counter erosion). Post-glacial rebound raises the land by a bit less than per year in the north and east, extending the coast. A circle enclosing the same area as Denmark would be in diameter with a circumference of (land area only: and respectively). It shares a border of with Germany to the south and is otherwise surrounded by of tidal shoreline (including small bays and inlets). No location in Denmark is farther from the coast than . On the south-west coast of Jutland, the tide is between , and the tideline moves outward and inward on a stretch. Denmark&#x27;s territorial waters total .

Denmark&#x27;s northernmost point is Skagen point (the north beach of the Skaw) at 57° 45&#x27; 7&quot; northern latitude; the southernmost is Gedser point (the southern tip of Falster) at 54° 33&#x27; 35&quot; northern latitude; the westernmost point is Blåvandshuk at 8° 4&#x27; 22&quot; eastern longitude; and the easternmost point is Østerskær at 15° 11&#x27; 55&quot; eastern longitude. This is in the small Ertholmene archipelago north-east of Bornholm. The distance from east to west is , from north to south .

The metropolitan part is flat with little elevation, having an average height above sea level of . The highest natural point is Møllehøj, at . Although this is by far the lowest high point in the Nordic countries and also less than half of the highest point in Southern Sweden, Denmark&#x27;s general elevation in its interior is generally at a safe level from rising sea levels. A sizeable portion of Denmark&#x27;s terrain consists of rolling plains whilst the coastline is sandy, with large dunes in northern Jutland. Although once extensively forested, today Denmark largely consists of arable land. It is drained by a dozen or so rivers, and the most significant include the Gudenå, Odense, Skjern, Suså and Vidå—a river that flows along its southern border with Germany. The country has 1008 lakes, 16 have an area of more than . Lake Arresø, located northwest of Copenhagen, is the largest lake.

The Kingdom of Denmark includes two overseas territories, both well to the west of Denmark: Greenland, the world&#x27;s largest island, and the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean. These territories are self-governing under their own parliaments (the Løgting and Inatsisartut) and form, together with continental Denmark, part of the Danish Realm, a country.

=== Climate ===
Denmark has a temperate climate, characterised by cool to cold winters, with mean temperatures in January of , and mild summers, with a mean temperature in August of . The most extreme temperatures recorded in Denmark, since 1874 when recordings began, was in 1975 and in 1982. Denmark has an average of 179 days per year with precipitation, on average receiving a total of per year; autumn is the wettest season and spring the driest. The position between a continent and an ocean means that the weather is often unstable.

Because of Denmark&#x27;s northern location, there are large seasonal variations in daylight: short days during the winter with sunrise coming around 8:45 am and sunset 3:45 pm (standard time), as well as long summer days with sunrise at 4:30 am and sunset at 10 pm (daylight saving time).

=== Ecology ===

Denmark belongs to the Boreal Kingdom and can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Atlantic mixed forests and Baltic mixed forests. Almost all of Denmark&#x27;s primeval temperate forests have been destroyed or fragmented, chiefly for agricultural purposes during the last millennia. The deforestation has created large swaths of heathland and devastating sand drifts. In spite of this, there are several larger second growth woodlands in the country and, in total, 12.9% of the land is now forested. Norway spruce is the most widespread tree (2017); an important tree in the Christmas tree production. Denmark holds a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.5/10, ranking it 171st globally out of 172 countries—behind only San Marino.

Roe deer occupy the countryside in growing numbers, and large-antlered red deer can be found in the sparse woodlands of Jutland. Denmark is also home to smaller mammals, such as polecats, hares and hedgehogs. Approximately 400 bird species inhabit Denmark and about 160 of those breed in the country. Large marine mammals include healthy populations of harbour porpoises, growing numbers of pinnipeds and occasional visits of whales, including blue whales and orcas. Cod, herring and plaice are abundant culinary fish in Danish waters and form the basis for a large fishing industry.

=== Environment ===
Denmark historically taken a progressive stance on environmental preservation: In 1971, it established a Ministry of Environment and was the first country in the world to implement an environmental law in 1973. Land and water pollution are two of Denmark&#x27;s most significant environmental issues, although much of its household and industrial waste is now increasingly filtered and sometimes recycled. Denmark is a signatory to the Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, its national ecological footprint is 8.26 global hectares per person, which is very high compared to a world average of 1.7 in 2010. Contributing factors are an exceptionally high value for cropland and grazing land, possibly due to substantially high meat production ( meat annually per capita) and economic size of the meat and dairy industries. 

Notwithstanding its relatively high emissions, Denmark topped the list of the 2015 Climate Change Performance Index due to its implementation effective climate protection policies. The country has consistently placed first since 2020. Denmark ranked 10th in the Environmental Performance Index, which measures progress at mitigating climate change, safeguarding ecosystem vitality, and promoting environmental health. In 2021, Denmark joined Costa Rica to launch the &quot;Beyond Oil and Gas alliance&quot; for stopping use fossil fuels. The Danish government stopped issuing new licences for oil and gas extraction in December 2020.

Denmark&#x27;s territories, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, catch approximately 650 whales per year. Greenland&#x27;s quotas for the catch of whales are determined according to the advice of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), having quota decision-making powers.

== Government and politics ==

Politics in Denmark operate under a framework laid out in the Constitution of Denmark. First written in 1849, it establishes a sovereign state in the form of a constitutional monarchy, with a representative unicameral parliamentary system. The monarch officially retains executive power and presides over the Council of State (privy council). In practice, the duties of the monarch are strictly representative and ceremonial, such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the Prime Minister and other Government ministers. The Monarch is not answerable for his or her actions, and their person is sacrosanct. Hereditary monarch King Frederik X has been head of state since 14 January 2024.

=== Government ===


The Danish parliament is unicameral and called the Folketing (). It is the legislature of the Kingdom of Denmark, passing acts that apply in Denmark and, variably, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The Folketing is also responsible for adopting the state&#x27;s budgets, approving the state&#x27;s accounts, appointing and exercising control of the Government, and taking part in international co-operation. Bills may be initiated by the Government or by members of parliament. All bills passed must be presented before the Council of State to receive Royal Assent within thirty days in order to become law.

Denmark is a representative democracy with universal suffrage. Membership of the Folketing is based on proportional representation of political parties, with a 2% electoral threshold. Denmark elects 175 members to the Folketing, with Greenland and the Faroe Islands electing an additional two members each—179 members in total. Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years, but it is within the powers of the prime minister to ask the monarch to call for an election before the term has elapsed. On a vote of no confidence, the Folketing may force a single minister or an entire government to resign.

The Government of Denmark operates as a cabinet government, where executive authority is exercised—formally, on behalf of the monarch—by the prime minister and other cabinet ministers, who head ministries. As the executive branch, the Cabinet is responsible for proposing bills and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies of Denmark. The position of prime minister belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of a majority in the Folketing; this is often the current leader of the largest political party or, more effectively, through a coalition of parties. A single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a cabinet on its own; Denmark has often been ruled by coalition governments, themselves usually minority governments dependent on non-government parties.

Following the 2022 Danish general election in November 2022, incumbent prime minister and Social Democratic leader Mette Frederiksen in December 2022 formed the current Frederiksen II Cabinet, a coalition government with the until then leading opposition party Venstre and the recently founded Moderate party.

=== Law and judicial system ===


Denmark has a civil law system with some references to Germanic law. Denmark resembles Norway and Sweden in never having developed a case-law like that of England and the United States nor comprehensive codes like those of France and Germany. Much of its law is customary.

The judicial system of Denmark is divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Articles sixty-two and sixty-four of the Constitution ensure judicial independence from government and Parliament by providing that judges shall only be guided by the law, including acts, statutes and practice. The Kingdom of Denmark does not have a single unified judicial system – Denmark has one system, Greenland another, and the Faroe Islands a third. However, decisions by the highest courts in Greenland and the Faroe Islands may be appealed to the Danish High Courts. The Danish Supreme Court is the highest civil and criminal court responsible for the administration of justice in the Kingdom.

=== Danish Realm ===


The Kingdom of Denmark is a unitary state that comprises, in addition to metropolitan Denmark, two autonomous territories in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. They have been integrated parts of the Danish Realm since the 18th century; however, due to their separate historical and cultural identities, these parts of the Realm have extensive political powers and have assumed legislative and administrative responsibility in a substantial number of fields. Home rule was granted to the Faroe Islands in 1948 and to Greenland in 1979, each having previously had the status of counties.

The Faroe Islands and Greenland have their own home governments and parliaments and are effectively self-governing in regards to domestic affairs apart from the judicial system and monetary policy. High Commissioners (&quot;&quot;) act as representatives of the Danish government in the Faroese Løgting and in the Greenlandic Parliament, but they cannot vote. The Faroese home government is defined to be an equal partner with the Danish national government, while the Greenlandic people are defined as a separate people with the right to self-determination.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Denmark, with a total area of , is divided into five administrative regions (). The regions are further subdivided into 98 municipalities (&quot;&quot;). The easternmost land in Denmark, the Ertholmene archipelago, with an area of 39 hectares (0.16 sq mi), is neither part of a municipality nor a region but belongs to the Ministry of Defence. The provinces of Denmark are statistical divisions of Denmark, positioned between the administrative regions and municipalities. They are not administrative divisions, nor subject for any kind of political elections, but are mainly for statistical use.

The regions were created on 1 January 2007 to replace the 16 former counties. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, reducing the number from 270. Most municipalities have a population of at least 20,000 to give them financial and professional sustainability, although a few exceptions were made to this rule. The administrative divisions are led by directly elected councils, elected proportionally every four years; the most recent Danish local elections were held on 16 November 2021. Other regional structures use the municipal boundaries as a layout, including the police districts, the court districts and the electoral wards.

==== Regions ====
The governing bodies of the regions are the regional councils, each with forty-one councillors elected for four-year terms. The councils are headed by regional district chairmen (&quot;&quot;), who are elected by the council.
The areas of responsibility for the regional councils are the national health service, social services and regional development. Unlike the counties they replaced, the regions are not allowed to levy taxes and the health service is partly financed by a national health care contribution until 2018 (&quot;&quot;), partly by funds from both government and municipalities. From 1 January 2019 this contribution will be abolished, as it is being replaced by higher income tax instead.

The area and populations of the regions vary widely; for example, the Capital Region has a population three times larger than that of North Denmark Region. Under the county system certain densely populated municipalities, such as Copenhagen Municipality and Frederiksberg, had been given a status equivalent to that of counties, making them first-level administrative divisions. These &quot;sui generis&quot; municipalities were incorporated into the new regions under the 2007 reforms.

=== Foreign relations ===

Denmark wields considerable influence in Northern Europe and is a middle power in international affairs. In recent years, Greenland and the Faroe Islands have been guaranteed a say in foreign policy issues such as fishing, whaling, and geopolitical concerns. The foreign policy of Denmark is substantially influenced by its membership of the European Union (EU); Denmark including Greenland joined the European Economic Community (EEC), the EU&#x27;s predecessor, in 1973. Denmark held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union on seven occasions, most recently from January to June 2012. Following World War II, Denmark ended its two-hundred-year-long policy of neutrality. It has been a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since 1949, and membership remains highly popular.

As a member of Development Assistance Committee (DAC), Denmark has for a long time been among the countries of the world contributing the largest percentage of gross national income to development aid. In 2015, Denmark contributed 0.85% of its gross national income (GNI) to foreign aid and was one of only six countries meeting the longstanding UN target of 0.7% of GNI. The country participates in both bilateral and multilateral aid, with the aid usually administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The organisational name of Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) is often used, in particular when operating bilateral aid. According to the 2024 Global Peace Index, Denmark is the 8th most peaceful country in the world.

=== Military ===


Denmark&#x27;s armed forces are known as the Danish Defence (). The Minister of Defence is commander-in-chief of the Danish Defence, and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad. During peacetime, the Ministry of Defence employs around 33,000 in total. The main military branches employ almost 27,000: 15,460 in the Royal Danish Army, 5,300 in the Royal Danish Navy and 6,050 in the Royal Danish Air Force (all including conscripts). The Danish Emergency Management Agency employs 2,000 (including conscripts), and about 4,000 are in non-branch-specific services like the Danish Defence Command and the Danish Defence Intelligence Service. Furthermore, around 44,500 serve as volunteers in the Danish Home Guard.

Denmark is a long-time supporter of international peacekeeping, but since the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the War in Afghanistan in 2001, Denmark has also found a new role as a warring nation, participating actively in several wars and invasions. This relatively new situation has stirred some internal critique, but the Danish population has generally been very supportive, in particular of the War in Afghanistan. The Danish Defence has around 1,400 staff in international missions, not including standing contributions to NATO SNMCMG1. Danish forces were heavily engaged in the former Yugoslavia in the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), with IFOR, and now SFOR. Between 2003 and 2007, there were approximately 450 Danish soldiers in Iraq. Denmark also strongly supported American operations in Afghanistan and has contributed both monetarily and materially to the ISAF. These initiatives are often described by the authorities as part of a new &quot;active foreign policy&quot; of Denmark.

== Economy ==

Denmark has a developed mixed economy that is classed as a high-income economy by the World Bank. In 2017, it ranked 16th in the world in terms of gross national income (PPP) per capita and 10th in nominal GNI per capita. Denmark&#x27;s economy stands out as one of the most free in the Index of Economic Freedom and the Economic Freedom of the World. It is the 10th most competitive economy in the world, and 6th in Europe, according to the World Economic Forum in its &quot;Global Competitiveness Report 2018&quot;.

Denmark has the fourth highest ratio of tertiary degree holders in the world. The country ranks highest in the world for workers&#x27; rights. GDP per hour worked was the 13th highest in 2009. The country has a market income inequality close to the OECD average, but after taxes and public cash transfers the income inequality is considerably lower. According to Eurostat, Denmark&#x27;s Gini coefficient for disposable income was the 7th-lowest among EU countries in 2017.
According to the International Monetary Fund, Denmark has the world&#x27;s highest minimum wage. As Denmark has no minimum wage legislation, the high wage floor has been attributed to the power of trade unions. For example, as the result of a collective bargaining agreement between the 3F trade union and the employers group Horesta, workers at McDonald&#x27;s and other fast food chains make the equivalent of US$20 an hour, which is more than double what their counterparts earn in the United States, and have access to paid vacation, parental leave and a pension plan. Union density in 2015 was 68%.

Once a predominantly agricultural country on account of its arable landscape, since 1945 Denmark has greatly expanded its industrial base and service sector. By 2017 services contributed circa 75% of GDP, manufacturing about 15% and agriculture less than 2%. Major industries include wind turbines, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, machinery and transportation equipment, food processing, and construction. Circa 60% of the total export value is due to export of goods, and the remaining 40% is from service exports, mainly sea transport. The country&#x27;s main export goods are: wind turbines, pharmaceuticals, machinery and instruments, meat and meat products, dairy products, fish, furniture and design. Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and has for a number of years had a balance of payments surplus which has transformed the country from a net debitor to a net creditor country. By 1 July 2018, the net international investment position (or net foreign assets) of Denmark was equal to 64.6% of GDP.
Denmark is part of the European Union&#x27;s internal market, which represents more than 508 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. Support for free trade is high among the Danish public; in a 2016 poll 57% responded saw globalisation as an opportunity whereas 18% viewed it as a threat. 70% of trade flows are inside the European Union. , Denmark&#x27;s largest export partners are Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Denmark&#x27;s currency, the &quot;krone&quot; (DKK), is pegged at approximately 7.46 kroner per euro through the ERM II. Although a September 2000 referendum rejected adopting the euro, the country follows the policies set forth in the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU) and meets the economic convergence criteria needed to adopt the euro. The majority of the political parties in the Folketing support joining the EMU, but since 2010 opinion polls have consistently shown a clear majority against adopting the euro. In March 2018, 29% of respondents from Denmark in a Eurobarometer opinion poll stated that they were in favour of the EMU and the euro, whereas 65% were against it. The exact same poll conducted in November 2023, was almost unchanged with 31% in favour and 63% against.

Ranked by turnover in Denmark, the largest Danish companies are: A.P. Møller-Mærsk (international shipping), Novo Nordisk (pharmaceuticals), ISS A/S (facility services), Vestas (wind turbines), Arla Foods (dairy), DSV (transport), Carlsberg Group (beer), Salling Group (retail), Ørsted A/S (power), Danske Bank.

The Danish government focused into methods to increase taxes on energy dealers in 2023.

=== Public policy ===

Danes enjoy a high standard of living and the Danish economy is characterised by extensive government welfare provisions. Denmark has a corporate tax rate of 22% and a special time-limited tax regime for expatriates. The Danish taxation system is broad based, with a 25% value-added tax, in addition to excise taxes, income taxes and other fees. The overall level of taxation (sum of all taxes, as a percentage of GDP) was 46% in 2017. The tax structure of Denmark (the relative weight of different taxes) differs from the OECD average, as the Danish tax system in 2015 was characterised by substantially higher revenues from taxes on personal income and a lower proportion of revenues from taxes on corporate income and gains and property taxes than in OECD generally, whereas no revenues at all derive from social security contributions. The proportion deriving from payroll taxes, VAT, and other taxes on goods and services correspond to the OECD average

, 6% of the population was reported to live below the poverty line, when adjusted for taxes and transfers. Denmark had the 2nd lowest relative poverty rate in the OECD, below the 11.3% OECD average. The 6% of the population reporting that they could not afford to buy sufficient food was less than half of the OECD average.

=== Labour market ===
Like other Nordic countries, Denmark has adopted the Nordic Model, which combines free market capitalism with a comprehensive welfare state and strong worker protection. As a result of its acclaimed &quot;flexicurity&quot; model, Denmark has the freest labour market in Europe, according to the World Bank. Employers can hire and fire whenever they want (flexibility), and between jobs, unemployment compensation is relatively high (security). According to OECD, initial as well as long-term net replacement rates for unemployed persons were 65% of previous net income in 2016, against an OECD average of 53%. No restrictions apply regarding overtime work, which allows companies to operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. With an employment rate in 2017 of 74.2% for people aged 15–64-years, Denmark ranks 9th highest among the OECD countries, and above the OECD average of 67.8%. The unemployment rate was 5.7% in 2017, which is considered close to or below its structural level.

The level of unemployment benefits is dependent on former employment and normally on membership of an unemployment fund, which is usually closely connected to a trade union, and previous payment of contributions. Circa 65% of the financing comes from earmarked member contributions, whereas the remaining third originates from the central government and hence from general taxation.

===Business===
Establishing a business in Denmark can be undertaken in a matter of hours and at very low costs. The Danish government operates a &quot;Danish Business Authority&quot;, and launched a series of initiatives in 2012 aiming to simplify business rules, making it easier to run a business without jeopardising the intended goals of relevant legislation.

=== Science and technology ===
Denmark has a long tradition of scientific and technological invention and engagement, and has been involved internationally from the very start of the scientific revolution. In current times, Denmark is participating in many high-profile international science and technology projects, including CERN, ITER, ESA, ISS and E-ELT. Denmark was ranked 10th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, down from 6th in 2020 and from 7th in 2019.

In the 20th century, Danes have also been innovative in several fields of the technology sector. Danish companies have been influential in the shipping industry with the design of the largest and most energy efficient container ships in the world, the Maersk Triple E class, and Danish engineers have contributed to the design of MAN Diesel engines. In the software and electronic field, Denmark contributed to design and manufacturing of Nordic Mobile Telephones, and the now-defunct Danish company DanCall was among the first to develop GSM mobile phones.

Life science is a key sector with extensive research and development activities. Danish engineers are world-leading in providing diabetes care equipment and medication products from Novo Nordisk and, since 2000, the Danish biotech company Novozymes, the world market leader in enzymes for first generation starch-based bioethanol, has pioneered development of enzymes for converting waste to cellulosic ethanol. &quot;Medicon Valley&quot;, spanning the Øresund Region between Zealand and Sweden, is one of Europe&#x27;s largest life science clusters.

Danish-born computer scientists and software engineers have taken leading roles in some of the world&#x27;s programming languages: Anders Hejlsberg (Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C#); Rasmus Lerdorf (PHP); Bjarne Stroustrup (C++); David Heinemeier Hansson (Ruby on Rails); Lars Bak, a pioneer in virtual machines (V8, Java VM, Dart). Physicist Lene Vestergaard Hau is the first person to stop light, leading to advances in quantum computing, nanoscale engineering, and linear optics.

=== Energy ===


Denmark has considerably large deposits of oil and natural gas in the North Sea and ranks as number 32 in the world among net exporters of crude oil and was producing 259,980 barrels of crude oil a day in 2009. Denmark is a long-time leader in wind power: In 2015 wind turbines provided 42.1% of the total electricity consumption. Denmark derived 3.1% of its gross domestic product from renewable (clean) energy technology and energy efficiency, or around €6.5 billion ($9.4 billion). Denmark is connected by electric transmission lines to other European countries.

Denmark&#x27;s electricity sector has integrated energy sources such as wind power into the national grid. Denmark now aims to focus on intelligent battery systems (V2G) and plug-in vehicles in the transport sector. The country is a member nation of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Denmark exported roughly 460 million GJ of energy in 2018.

=== Transport ===


Significant investment has been made in building road and rail links between regions in Denmark, most notably the Great Belt Fixed Link, which connects Zealand and Funen. It is now possible to drive from Frederikshavn in northern Jutland to Copenhagen on eastern Zealand without leaving the motorway. The main railway operator is DSB for passenger services and DB Cargo for freight trains. The railway tracks are maintained by Banedanmark. The North Sea and the Baltic Sea are intertwined by various, international ferry links. Construction of the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link, connecting Denmark and Germany with a second link, Started in 2021. Copenhagen has a rapid transit system, the Copenhagen Metro, and an extensive electrified suburban railway network, the S-train. In the four largest cities – Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, Aalborg – light rail systems are planned to be in operation around 2020.

Cycling in Denmark is a very common form of transport, particularly for the young and for city dwellers. With a network of bicycle routes extending more than 12,000 km and an estimated 7,000 km of segregated dedicated bicycle paths and lanes, Denmark has a solid bicycle infrastructure.

Private vehicles are increasingly used as a means of transport. Because of the high registration tax (150%), VAT (25%), and one of the world&#x27;s highest income tax rates, new cars are very expensive. The purpose of the tax is to discourage car ownership.
In 2007, an attempt was made by the government to favour environmentally friendly cars by slightly reducing taxes on high mileage vehicles. However, this has had little effect, and in 2008 Denmark experienced an increase in the import of fuel inefficient old cars, as the cost for older cars—including taxes—keeps them within the budget of many Danes.
, the average car age is 9.2 years.

With Norway and Sweden, Denmark is part of the Scandinavian Airlines flag carrier. Copenhagen Airport is Scandinavia&#x27;s busiest passenger airport, handling over 25 million passengers in 2014. Other notable airports are Billund Airport, Aalborg Airport, and Aarhus Airport.

== Demographics ==


=== Population ===
In April 2020, the population of Denmark, as registered by Statistics Denmark, was 5.825 million. Denmark has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 41.9 years, with 0.97 males per female. Despite a low birth rate, the population is growing at an average annual rate of 0.59% because of net immigration and increasing longevity. The World Happiness Report frequently ranks Denmark&#x27;s population as the happiest in the world. This has been attributed to the country&#x27;s highly regarded education and health care systems, and its low level of income inequality. People in Denmark feel responsible for social welfare. The rate of taxation is among the world&#x27;s highest and can be half a Dane&#x27;s income but they get most healthcare free, university tuition is also free and students get grants, there is subsidized child care and old people get pensions and care helpers.

Denmark is a historically homogeneous nation. However, as with its Scandinavian neighbours, Denmark has recently transformed from a nation of net emigration, up until World War II, to a nation of net immigration. Today, residence permits are issued mostly to immigrants from other EU countries (54% of all non-Scandinavian immigrants in 2017). Another 31% of residence permits were study- or work-related, 4% were issued to asylum seekers and 10% to persons who arrive as family dependants. Overall, the net migration rate in 2017 was 2.1 migrant(s)/1,000 population, somewhat lower than the United Kingdom and the other Nordic countries.

There are no official statistics on ethnic groups, but according to 2020 figures from Statistics Denmark, 86.1% of the population in Denmark was of Danish descent (including &quot;Faroese&quot; and &quot;Greenlandic&quot;), defined as having at least one parent who was born in the Kingdom of Denmark and holds Danish nationality. The remaining 13.89% were of foreign background, defined as immigrants or descendants of recent immigrants. With the same definition, the most common countries of origin were Turkey, Poland, Syria, Germany, Iraq, Romania, Lebanon, Pakistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Somalia. Minorities in Denmark include Turks, Poles, Syrians, Germans, Iraqis, Romanians and people from former Yugoslavia. There are also other Asian and African populations in the country. Small numbers of Romani people and Hungarians live in Denmark. There is also a small Jewish population.

The Inuit are Indigenous to Greenland in the Kingdom and have traditionally inhabited Greenland and the northern parts of Canada and Alaska in the Arctic. From the 18th century up to the 1970s, the Danish government (Dano-Norwegian until 1814) tried to assimilate the Greenlandic Inuit, encouraging them to adopt the majority language and culture. Because of this &quot;Danization process&quot;, some persons of Inuit ancestry now identify their mother tongue as Danish.

=== Languages ===
Danish is the &quot;de facto&quot; national language of Denmark. Faroese and Greenlandic are the official languages of the Faroe Islands and Greenland respectively. German is a recognised minority language in the area of the former South Jutland County (now part of the Region of Southern Denmark), which was part of the German Empire prior to the Treaty of Versailles. Danish and Faroese belong to the North Germanic (Nordic) branch of the Indo-European languages, along with Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish. There is some degree of mutual intelligibility between Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Danish is more distantly related to German, which is a West Germanic language. Greenlandic or &quot;Kalaallisut&quot; is an Inuit language, and is entirely unrelated to Danish, although it has adopted many Danish loanwords including the words for numbers.

A large majority (86%) of Danes speak English as a second language, generally with a high level of proficiency. German is the second-most spoken foreign language, with 47% reporting a conversational level of proficiency. Denmark had 25,900 native speakers of German in 2007 (mostly in the South Jutland area).

=== Religion ===


Christianity is the dominant religion in Denmark. As of 2024, 71.2% of the population of Denmark were members of the Church of Denmark (), the officially established church, which is Protestant in classification and Lutheran in orientation. The membership percentage has been in steady decline since the 1970s, mainly as fewer newborns are being baptised into it. Only 3% of the population regularly attend Sunday services and only 19% of Danes consider religion to be an important part of their life.

The Constitution states that the sovereign must have the Lutheran faith, though the rest of the population is free to adhere to other faiths. In 1682 the state granted limited recognition to three religious groups dissenting from the Established Church: Roman Catholicism, the Reformed Church and Judaism, although conversion to these groups from the Church of Denmark remained illegal initially. Until the 1970s, the state formally recognised &quot;religious societies&quot; by royal decree. Today, religious groups do not need official government recognition, they can be granted the right to perform weddings and other ceremonies without this recognition. Denmark&#x27;s Muslims make up approximately 4.4% of the population and form the country&#x27;s second largest religious community and largest minority religion. The Danish Foreign Ministry estimates that other religious groups comprise less than 1% of the population individually and approximately 2% when taken all together. Just under 20% of the Danish population identifies as atheist.

According to a 2010 Eurobarometer poll, 28% of Danish nationals polled responded that they &quot;believe there is a God&quot;, 47% responded that they &quot;believe there is some sort of spirit or life force&quot; and 24% responded that they &quot;do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force&quot;. Another poll, carried out in 2009, found that 25% of Danes believe Jesus is the son of God, and 18% believe he is the saviour of the world.

In its 2024 Freedom in the World report, Freedom House rated the country 4 out of 4 for religious freedom.

=== Education ===


All educational programmes in Denmark are regulated by the Ministry of Education and administered by local municipalities. &quot;Folkeskole&quot; covers the entire period of compulsory education, encompassing primary and lower secondary education. Most children attend &quot;folkeskole&quot; for 10 years, from the ages of 6 to 16. There are no final examinations, but pupils can choose to sit an exam when finishing ninth grade (14–15 years old). The test is obligatory if further education is to be attended. Alternatively pupils can attend an independent school (), or a private school (), such as Christian schools or Waldorf schools.

Following graduation from compulsory education, there are several continuing educational opportunities; the Gymnasium (STX) attaches importance in teaching a mix of humanities and science, Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX) focuses on scientific subjects and the Higher Commercial Examination Programme emphasises on subjects in economics. Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) is similar to &quot;Gymnasium (STX)&quot;, but is one year shorter. For specific professions, there is vocational education, training young people for work in specific trades by a combination of teaching and apprenticeship.

The government records upper secondary school completion rates of 95% and tertiary enrollment and completion rates of 60%. All university and college (tertiary) education in Denmark is free of charges; there are no tuition fees to enrol in courses. Students aged 18 or above may apply for state educational support grants, known as &quot;Statens Uddannelsesstøtte (SU)&quot;, which provides fixed financial support, disbursed monthly. Danish universities offer international students a range of opportunities for obtaining an internationally recognised qualification in Denmark. Many programmes may be taught in the English language, the academic lingua franca, in bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, doctorates and student exchange programmes.

=== Health ===
, Denmark has a life expectancy of 80.6 years at birth (78.6 for men, 82.5 for women), up from 76.9 years in 2000. This ranks it 27th among 193 nations, behind the other Nordic countries. The &quot;National Institute of Public Health&quot; of the University of Southern Denmark has calculated 19 major risk factors among Danes that contribute to a lowering of the life expectancy; this includes smoking, alcohol, drug abuse and physical inactivity. Although the obesity rate is lower than in North America and most other European countries, the large number of overweight Danes results in an annual additional consumption in the health care system of DKK 1,625 million. In a 2012 study, Denmark had the highest cancer rate of all countries listed by the World Cancer Research Fund International; researchers suggest the reasons are better reporting, but also lifestyle factors like heavy alcohol consumption, smoking and physical inactivity.

Denmark has a universal health care system, characterised by being publicly financed through taxes and, for most of the services, run directly by the regional authorities. One of the sources of income was a national health care contribution (&quot;&quot;) (2007–11:8%; &#x27;12:7%; &#x27;13:6%; &#x27;14:5%; &#x27;15:4%; &#x27;16:3%; &#x27;17:2%; &#x27;18:1%; &#x27;19:0%) but it was phased out from January 2019 in favour of income taxes. This means that most health care provision is free at the point of delivery for all residents. Additionally, roughly two in five have complementary private insurance to cover services not fully covered by the state, such as physiotherapy. , Denmark spends 11.2% of its GDP on health care; this is up from 9.8% in 2007 (US$3,512 per capita). This places Denmark above the OECD average and above the other Nordic countries.

=== Vulnerable residential areas ===
Certain social housing districts in Denmark fulfilling specific statistical criteria of relatively low employment, school attendance, relatively low income, a relatively low educational level or relatively many convicted inhabitants are officially listed by the government as vulnerable residential areas. In some cases, the majority of the neighbourhoods consist of non-Western immigrants and their descendants. Over the years, several government initiatives have been taken to further integration and counter urban decay in these neighbourhoods. Major plans to this end were presented in 1994 and 2000 by the governments of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, in 2004 by the Anders Fogh Rasmussen I Cabinet, in 2010 by the Lars Løkke Rasmussen I Cabinet, in 2013 by the Helle Thorning-Schmidt I Cabinet, in 2018 by the Lars Løkke Rasmussen III Cabinet, and in 2021 by the Mette Frederiksen I Cabinet. Some of the policies have been criticised for undercutting &#x27;equality before law&#x27; and for portraying immigrants, especially Muslim immigrants, in a bad light.

During the years 2010–2021, the term &quot;ghetto&quot; was used officially to designate some or all of the vulnerable areas. The term was considered controversial, however, and removed in 2021. Denmark is the only country to have officially used the word &#x27;ghetto&#x27; in the 21st century to denote certain residential areas. From 2021, four different lists are published, depending on the residents&#x27; income levels, employment status, education levels, criminal convictions and origin (a statistical criterion based on parents&#x27; geographical birthplace and citizenship). In 2023, there were 19 vulnerable residential areas in Denmark.

== Culture ==
Denmark shares strong cultural and historic ties with its Scandinavian neighbours Sweden and Norway. It has historically been one of the most socially progressive cultures in the world. In 1969, Denmark was the first country to legalise pornography, and in 2012, Denmark replaced its &quot;registered partnership&quot; laws, which it had been the first country to introduce in 1989, with gender-neutral marriage, and allowed same-sex marriages to be performed in the Church of Denmark. Modesty and social equality are important parts of Danish culture. In a 2016 study comparing empathy scores of 63 countries, Denmark ranked 4th world-wide having the highest empathy among surveyed European countries.

The astronomical discoveries of Tycho Brahe, Ludwig A. Colding&#x27;s neglected articulation of the principle of conservation of energy, and the contributions to atomic physics of Niels Bohr indicate the range of Danish scientific achievement. The fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen, the philosophical essays of Søren Kierkegaard, the short stories of Karen Blixen (penname Isak Dinesen), the plays of Ludvig Holberg, and the dense, aphoristic poetry of Piet Hein, have earned international recognition, as have the symphonies of Carl Nielsen. From the mid-1990s, Danish films have attracted international attention, especially those associated with Dogme 95 like those of Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg.

A major feature of Danish culture is Jul (Danish Christmas). The holiday is celebrated throughout December, starting either at the beginning of Advent or on 1 December with a variety of traditions, culminating with the Christmas Eve meal.

There are seven heritage sites inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in Northern Europe: Christiansfeld, a Moravian Church Settlement, the Jelling Mounds (Runic Stones and Church), Kronborg Castle, Roskilde Cathedral, and The par force hunting landscape in North Zealand and 3 in the World Heritage list in North America: Ilulissat Icefjord, Aasivissuit—Nipisat, Kujataa within the Kingdom of Denmark.

=== Human rights ===
Denmark is usually considered a progressive country, which has adopted legislation and policies to support women&#x27;s rights, minority rights, and LGBT rights. Human rights in Denmark are protected by the state&#x27;s Constitution of the Realm &quot;(Danmarks Riges Grundlov)&quot;; applying equally in Denmark proper, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, and through the ratification of international human rights treaties. Denmark has held a significant role in the adoption of both the European Convention on Human Rights and in the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). In 1987, the Kingdom Parliament (&quot;Folketinget&quot;) established a national human rights institution, the Danish Centre of Human Rights, now the Danish Institute for Human Rights.

In 2009, a referendum on changing the Danish Act of Succession were held to grant absolute primogeniture to the Danish throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. As it was not retroactive, the current successor to the throne is the eldest son of the King, rather than his eldest child. The Danish constitution Article 2 states that &quot;The monarchy is inherited by men and women&quot;.

The Inuit have for decades been the subject of discrimination and abuse by the dominant colonisers from Europe, those countries claiming possession of Inuit lands. The Inuit have never been a single community in a single region of Inuit. From the 18th century up to the 1970s, the Danish government (Dano-Norwegian until 1814) tried to assimilate the Indigenous people of Greenland, the Greenlandic Inuit, encouraging them to adopt the majority language, culture and religion. Denmark has been greatly criticised by the Greenlandic community for the politics of &quot;Danisation&quot; (1950s and 1960s) of and discrimination against the Indigenous population of the country. Critical treatment paying non-Inuit workers higher wages than the local people, the relocation of entire families from their traditional lands into settlements, and separating children from their parents and sending them away to Denmark for schooling has been practised. Nevertheless, Denmark ratified, in 1996, to recognise the ILO-convention 169 on Indigenous people recommended by the UN.

Denmark was the first country in the world to grant legal recognition to same-sex unions in the form of registered partnerships in 1989. On 7 June 2012, the law was replaced by a new same-sex marriage law, which came into effect on 15 June 2012. Greenland and the Faroe Islands legalised same-sex marriage in April 2016, and in July 2017 respectively. In January 2016, a resolution was implemented by the Danish parliament which prevented transgender identity being classified as a mental health condition. In doing so, Denmark became the first country in Europe to go against the World Health Organization (WHO) standards, which classified transgender identity as being a mental health issue until June 2018.

In its 2024 Freedom in the World report, Freedom House rated the country &quot;free&quot; with a score of 97 (out of 100).

=== Media ===

Danish cinema dates back to 1897 and since the 1980s has maintained a steady stream of productions due largely to funding by the state-supported Danish Film Institute. There have been three big internationally important waves of Danish cinema: erotic melodrama of the silent era; the increasingly explicit sex films of the 1960s and 1970s; and lastly, the Dogme 95 movement of the late 1990s, where directors often used hand-held cameras to dynamic effect in a conscious reaction against big-budget studios. Danish films have been noted for their realism, religious and moral themes, sexual frankness and technical innovation. The Danish filmmaker Carl Th. Dreyer is considered one of the greatest directors of early cinema.

Other Danish filmmakers of note include Erik Balling, the creator of the popular &quot;Olsen-banden&quot; films; Gabriel Axel, an Oscar-winner for &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot; in 1987; and Bille August, the Oscar-, - and Golden Globe-winner for &quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot; in 1988. In the modern era, notable filmmakers in Denmark include Lars von Trier, who co-created the Dogme 95 movement with Thomas Vinterberg, and multiple award-winners Susanne Bier and Nicolas Winding Refn. Mads Mikkelsen is a world-renowned Danish actor, as is Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.

Danish mass media date back to the 1540s, when handwritten fly sheets reported on the news. In 1666, Anders Bording, the father of Danish journalism, began a state paper. In 1834, the first liberal, factual newspaper appeared, and the 1849 Constitution established lasting freedom of the press in Denmark.

Modern Danish mass media and news programming are dominated by a few large corporations. In printed media JP/Politikens Hus and Berlingske Media, between them, control the largest newspapers &quot;Politiken&quot;, &quot;Berlingske Tidende&quot; and and major tabloids &quot;B.T.&quot; and . In television, publicly owned stations DR and TV 2 have large shares of the viewers. DR in particular is famous for its high quality TV-series often sold to foreign broadcasters and often with leading female characters like internationally known actresses Sidse Babett Knudsen and Sofie Gråbøl. In radio, DR has a near monopoly, currently broadcasting on all four nationally available FM channels, competing only with local stations.

=== Music ===

Denmark and its multiple outlying islands have a wide range of folk traditions. The country&#x27;s most famous classical composer is Carl Nielsen (1865–1931), especially remembered for his six symphonies and his Wind Quintet, while the Royal Danish Ballet specialises in the work of the Danish choreographer August Bournonville. The Royal Danish Orchestra is among the world&#x27;s oldest orchestras. Danes have distinguished themselves as jazz musicians, and the Copenhagen Jazz Festival has acquired international recognition.

The modern pop and rock scene has produced a few names of international fame, including Aqua, Alphabeat, D-A-D, King Diamond, Kashmir, Lukas Graham, Mew, Michael Learns to Rock, MØ, Oh Land, The Raveonettes and Volbeat, among others. Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band Metallica, has become the first Danish musician to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Roskilde Festival near Copenhagen is the largest music festival in Northern Europe since 1971 and Denmark has many recurring music festivals of all genres throughout, including Aarhus International Jazz Festival, Skanderborg Festival, The Blue Festival in Aalborg, Esbjerg International Chamber Music Festival and Skagen Festival among many others.

Denmark has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since 1957 and has won the contest three times, in 1963, 2000 and 2013.

=== Architecture and design ===

Denmark&#x27;s architecture became firmly established in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. From the 16th century, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country&#x27;s fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the Renaissance style.
During the 17th century, many impressive buildings were built in the Baroque style, both in the capital and the provinces. Neoclassicism from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of Historicism ultimately merged into the 19th-century National Romantic style.

The 20th century brought along new architectural styles; including expressionism, best exemplified by the designs of architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint, which relied heavily on Scandinavian brick Gothic traditions; and Nordic Classicism, which enjoyed brief popularity in the early decades of the century. It was in the 1960s that Danish architects such as Arne Jacobsen entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalist architecture. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class masterpieces including Jørn Utzon&#x27;s Sydney Opera House and Johan Otto von Spreckelsen&#x27;s Grande Arche in Paris, paving the way for a number of contemporary Danish designers such as Bjarke Ingels to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad.

Danish design is a term often used to describe a style of functionalistic design and architecture that was developed in the mid-20th century, originating in Denmark. Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards. The Royal Porcelain Factory is famous for the quality of its ceramics. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous, 20th-century designers and architects such as Børge Mogensen, Finn Juhl, Hans Wegner, Arne Jacobsen, Poul Henningsen and Verner Panton. Other designers of note include Kristian Solmer Vedel in the area of industrial design, Jens Quistgaard for kitchen furniture and implements and Ole Wanscher who had a classical approach to furniture design.

=== Literature and philosophy ===

The first known Danish literature is myths and folklore from the 10th and 11th century. Saxo Grammaticus, normally considered the first Danish writer, worked on a chronicle of Danish history (). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the Middle Ages. With the Age of Enlightenment came Ludvig Holberg whose comedy plays are still being performed.

In the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the Modern Breakthrough, this movement was championed by Georg Brandes, Henrik Pontoppidan (awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature) and J. P. Jacobsen. Romanticism influenced the renowned writer and poet Hans Christian Andersen, known for his stories and fairy tales, e.g. &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;. In recent history Johannes Vilhelm Jensen was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Karen Blixen is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are Herman Bang, Gustav Wied, William Heinesen, Martin Andersen Nexø, Piet Hein, Hans Scherfig, Klaus Rifbjerg, Dan Turèll, Tove Ditlevsen, Inger Christensen and Peter Høeg.

Danish philosophy has a long tradition as part of Western philosophy. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was Søren Kierkegaard, the creator of Christian existentialism. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including Harald Høffding, who later in his life moved on to join the movement of positivism. Another Danish philosopher of note is Grundtvig, whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.

=== Painting and photography ===

While Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th and 16th century church frescos, which can be seen in many of the country&#x27;s older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.

The Danish Golden Age, which began in the first half of the 19th century, was inspired by a new feeling of nationalism and romanticism, typified in the later previous century by history painter Nicolai Abildgaard. Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg was not only a productive artist in his own right but taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where his students included Wilhelm Bendz, Christen Købke, Martinus Rørbye, Constantin Hansen, and Wilhelm Marstrand.

In 1871, Holger Drachmann and Karl Madsen visited Skagen in the far north of Jutland where they quickly built up one of Scandinavia&#x27;s most successful artists&#x27; colonies specialising in Naturalism and Realism rather than in the traditional approach favoured by the academy. Hosted by Michael and his wife Anna, they were soon joined by P.S. Krøyer, Carl Locher and Laurits Tuxen. All participated in painting the natural surroundings and local people. Similar trends developed on Funen with the &quot;Fynboerne&quot; who included Johannes Larsen, Fritz Syberg and Peter Hansen, and on the island of Bornholm with the Bornholm school of painters including Niels Lergaard, Kræsten Iversen and Oluf Høst.

Painting has continued to be a prominent form of artistic expression in Danish culture, inspired by and also influencing major international trends in this area. These include impressionism and the modernist styles of expressionism, abstract painting and surrealism. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes De Tretten (1909–1912), Linien (1930s and 1940s), COBRA (1948–1951), Fluxus (1960s and 1970s), De Unge Vilde (1980s) and more recently Superflex (founded in 1993). Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various art movements include Theodor Philipsen (impressionism and naturalism), Anna Klindt Sørensen (expressionism), Franciska Clausen (Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), Henry Heerup (naivism), Robert Jacobsen (abstract painting), Carl Henning Pedersen (abstract painting), Asger Jorn (Situationist, abstract painting), Bjørn Wiinblad (art deco, orientalism), Per Kirkeby (neo-expressionism, abstract painting), Per Arnoldi (pop art), and Michael Kvium (neo-surrealism).

Danish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the art of photography in 1839. Pioneers such as Mads Alstrup and Georg Emil Hansen paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century. Today Danish photographers such as Astrid Kruse Jensen and Jacob Aue Sobol are active in key exhibitions around the world.

=== Cuisine ===


The traditional cuisine of Denmark, like that of the other Nordic countries and of Northern Germany, consists mainly of meat, fish and potatoes. Danish dishes are highly seasonal, stemming from the country&#x27;s agricultural past, its geography, and its climate of long, cold winters.

The open sandwiches on rye bread, known as &quot;smørrebrød&quot;, can be considered a national speciality. Hot meals traditionally consist of ground meats, such as &quot;frikadeller&quot; (meat balls of veal and pork) and &quot;hakkebøf&quot; (minced beef patties), or of more substantial meat and fish dishes such as &quot;flæskesteg&quot; (roast pork with crackling) and &quot;kogt torsk&quot; (poached cod) with mustard sauce. Denmark is known for its Carlsberg and Tuborg beers and for its akvavit and bitters.

Since around 1970, chefs and restaurants across Denmark have introduced gourmet cooking, largely influenced by French cuisine. Also inspired by continental practices, Danish chefs have recently developed a new innovative cuisine and a series of gourmet dishes based on high-quality local produce known as New Danish cuisine. As a result of these developments, Denmark now has a considerable number of internationally acclaimed restaurants of which several have been awarded Michelin stars. This includes Geranium and Noma in Copenhagen.

=== Sports ===

Sports are popular in Denmark, and its citizens participate in and watch a wide variety. The national sport is football, with over 320,000 players in more than 1600 clubs. Denmark qualified six times consecutively for the European Championships between 1984 and 2004, and were crowned European champions in 1992; other significant achievements include winning the Confederations Cup in 1995 and reaching the quarter-final of the 1998 World Cup.
The Denmark women&#x27;s national handball team celebrated great successes during the 1990s and has won a total of 13 medals—seven gold (in 1994, 1996 (2), 1997, 2000, 2002 and 2004), four silver (in 1962, 1993, 1998 and 2004) and two bronze (in 1995 and 2013). On the men&#x27;s side, Denmark has won 12 medals—four gold (in 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2019), four silver (in 1967, 2011, 2013 and 2014) and four bronze (in 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2007)—the most that have been won by any team in European Handball Championship history. In 2019, the Danish men&#x27;s national handball team won their first World Championship title.

In recent years, Denmark has made a mark as a strong cycling nation, with Michael Rasmussen reaching King of the Mountains status in the Tour de France in 2005 and 2006. Other popular sports include golf—which is mostly popular among those in the older demographic; tennis—in which Denmark is successful on a professional level; basketball—Denmark joined the international governing body FIBA in 1951; rugby—the Danish Rugby Union dates back to 1950; ice hockey—often competing in the top division in the Men&#x27;s World Championships; rowing—Denmark specialise in lightweight rowing and are particularly known for their lightweight coxless four, having won six gold and two silver World Championship medals and three gold and two bronze Olympic medals; and several indoor sports—especially badminton, table tennis and gymnastics, in each of which Denmark holds World Championships and Olympic medals.

<text>Limited animation is a process in the overall technique of traditional animation that reuses frames of character animation.

==Early history==
The use of budget-cutting and time-saving animation measures in animation dates back to the earliest commercial animation, including cycled animations, mirror-image and symmetrical drawings, still characters, and other labor-saving methods. In general, the progression was from early productions in which every frame was drawn by hand, independent of each other drawing, toward more limited animation that made use of the same drawings in different ways. 

Winsor McCay, a man who put an unprecedented amount of detail into his animations, boasted that in his 1914 film, &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot;, everything moved, including the rocks and blades of grass in the background. In contrast, his 1918 film &quot;The Sinking of the Lusitania&quot; progressed to using cels over still backgrounds, while still maintaining a level of detail comparable to that of &quot;Gertie&quot;. 

The 1942 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon &quot;The Dover Boys&quot;, directed by Chuck Jones, is one of the earliest Warner Bros. cartoons to extensively employ some of the processes of what would become known as &quot;limited animation&quot;, particularly its use of characters that either stand still or move so quickly that the actual motion appears to be a blur. This animation technique has come to be known as the smear frame.

== Countries ==

=== United States ===

Hanna-Barbera Productions used limited animation throughout its existence. When the company&#x27;s namesakes, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, separated from the MGM studio in 1957, they opted to take a drastically different approach to animation than they had for their fully animated short films; as television screens were much smaller than theater screens at the time, limited animation, with its emphasis on character close-ups and dialogue-based humor, was a better fit for the more intimate home viewer experience. At the time, most feature films (along with animated shorts, including Hanna and Barbera&#x27;s own work on &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;) were transitioning to the widescreen CinemaScope process, which made it more difficult to replicate intimacy; The Walt Disney Company, though they continued to use full animation, had also used character close-ups and personality-driven humor in their early films. When Disney produced &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; in CinemaScope, the process made it difficult to replicate that style, a problem that Hanna-Barbera did not have with smaller, more square television screens.

The financial benefits of limited animation led to television animation companies relying on the process extensively in the television era. Jay Ward Productions relied on limited animation for those reasons, compensating with its heavy Cold War satire and a style of deadpan comedy that would become a trademark of the studio&#x27;s style. One of the frequent users of limited animation was HB&#x27;s Saturday-morning rival Filmation (makers of &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; and &quot;BraveStarr&quot;) which gave their work a distinct look. Bill Melendez used a form of limited animation to adapt the &quot;Peanuts&quot; franchise to television and later film; in addition to the cost and time concerns (especially for his first special &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, which was given only a $76,000 budget and four months to produce 30 minutes of animation), Meléndez also noted that &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles M. Schulz had designed the characters with a flat style well-suited for limited animation. The short-lived Cambria Studios turned out three serials (including &quot;Clutch Cargo&quot;) using one of the most inexpensive approaches to animation possible: known as Syncro-Vox, it involved superimposing film of the voice actor&#x27;s moving lips over a still frame of the character. Disney themselves resorted to some limited animation tricks in an effort to cut its budget during the 1960s, particularly with its usage of xerography in &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, which resulted in artwork with heavier, rougher outlines than had previously been seen in Disney films up to that point. 

By the 1970s, the usage of limited animation in Saturday morning cartoons had become common. Walter Williams, creator of &quot;The Mr. Bill Show&quot;, noted that cartoons in the 1970s were so static, he expected the artist&#x27;s hands to enter the screen at any moment and physically start moving the drawings around. This inspired him to create the &quot;Mr. Hands&quot; character in &quot;The Mr. Bill Show&quot;, who literally did just that.

=== Japan ===

Limited animation proved to be particularly popular in Japan, such that the Japanese word for animation, &quot;anime&quot;, entered the English lexicon as a loanword for the distinctive style of Japanese animation that took root there. Anime features scenes of mouth moving with occasional eye blinks, rendered long shots of detailed backgrounds, a low frame rate (especially in earlier productions) and rare use of 2D fluidity on motion-blur filled action alongside reused drawings, using style conventions from Japanese comic books (manga). It also has the benefit of lower cost productions and stylized content as opposed to realistic animation. As was the case in the United States, television was a major impetus for the growth of anime in Japan; the country&#x27;s recovery from World War II led to economic prosperity and a boom in Japanese television ownership, and the development of anime allowed Japan to compete in an animation field where they had previously lagged well behind the West.

=== Philippines ===

Limited animation made an early history of Philippine animation in the 1970s, established a historical propaganda film &quot;Tadhana&quot;, directed by Nonoy Marcelo. Unlike any influential animated films in the Philippines, &quot;Tadhana&quot;&#x27;s use of animation is crude but unique with distinctive features.

<text>Electrocardiography is the process of producing an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), a recording of the heart&#x27;s electrical activity through repeated cardiac cycles. It is an electrogram of the heart which is a graph of voltage versus time of the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes detect the small electrical changes that are a consequence of cardiac muscle depolarization followed by repolarization during each cardiac cycle (heartbeat). Changes in the normal ECG pattern occur in numerous cardiac abnormalities, including:

* Cardiac rhythm disturbances, such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia; 
* Inadequate coronary artery blood flow, such as myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction; 

* and electrolyte disturbances, such as hypokalemia.

Traditionally, &quot;ECG&quot; usually means a 12-lead ECG taken while lying down as discussed below.
However, other devices can record the electrical activity of the heart such as a Holter monitor but also some models of smartwatch are capable of recording an ECG.
ECG signals can be recorded in other contexts with other devices.

In a conventional 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes are placed on the patient&#x27;s limbs and on the surface of the chest. The overall magnitude of the heart&#x27;s electrical potential is then measured from twelve different angles (&quot;leads&quot;) and is recorded over a period of time (usually ten seconds). In this way, the overall magnitude and direction of the heart&#x27;s electrical depolarization is captured at each moment throughout the cardiac cycle.

There are three main components to an ECG: 
* The P wave, which represents depolarization of the atria.
* The QRS complex, which represents depolarization of the ventricles.
* The T wave, which represents repolarization of the ventricles.

During each heartbeat, a healthy heart has an orderly progression of depolarization that starts with pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, spreads throughout the atrium, and passes through the atrioventricular node down into the bundle of His and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading down and to the left throughout the ventricles. This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic ECG tracing. To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a large amount of information about the structure of the heart and the function of its electrical conduction system. Among other things, an ECG can be used to measure the rate and rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the heart chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart&#x27;s muscle cells or conduction system, the effects of heart drugs, and the function of implanted pacemakers.

==Medical uses==

The overall goal of performing an ECG is to obtain information about the electrical functioning of the heart. Medical uses for this information are varied and often need to be combined with knowledge of the structure of the heart and physical examination signs to be interpreted. Some indications for performing an ECG include the following:
* Chest pain or suspected myocardial infarction (heart attack), such as ST elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
* Symptoms such as shortness of breath, murmurs, fainting, seizures, funny turns, or arrhythmias including new onset palpitations or monitoring of known cardiac arrhythmias
* Medication monitoring (e.g., drug-induced QT prolongation, digoxin toxicity) and management of overdose (e.g., tricyclic overdose)
* Electrolyte abnormalities, such as hyperkalemia
* Perioperative monitoring in which any form of anesthesia is involved (e.g., monitored anesthesia care, general anesthesia). This includes preoperative assessment and intraoperative and postoperative monitoring.
* Cardiac stress testing
* Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the heart (ECG is used to &quot;gate&quot; the scanning so that the anatomical position of the heart is steady)
* Clinical cardiac electrophysiology, in which a catheter is inserted through the femoral vein and can have several electrodes along its length to record the direction of electrical activity from within the heart.

ECGs can be recorded as short intermittent tracings or &quot;continuous&quot; ECG monitoring. Continuous monitoring is used for critically ill patients, patients undergoing general anesthesia, and patients who have an infrequently occurring cardiac arrhythmia that would unlikely be seen on a conventional ten-second ECG. Continuous monitoring can be conducted by using Holter monitors, internal and external defibrillators and pacemakers, and/or biotelemetry.

===Screening===

For adults, evidence does not support the use of ECGs among those without symptoms or at low risk of cardiovascular disease as an effort for prevention. This is because an ECG may falsely indicate the existence of a problem, leading to misdiagnosis, the recommendation of invasive procedures, and overtreatment. However, persons employed in certain critical occupations, such as aircraft pilots, may be required to have an ECG as part of their routine health evaluations. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening may also be considered in adolescents as part of a sports physical out of concern for sudden cardiac death.

==Electrocardiograph machines==
Electrocardiograms are recorded by machines that consist of a set of electrodes connected to a central unit. Early ECG machines were constructed with analog electronics, where the signal drove a motor to print out the signal onto paper. Today, electrocardiographs use analog-to-digital converters to convert the electrical activity of the heart to a digital signal. Many ECG machines are now portable and commonly include a screen, keyboard, and printer on a small wheeled cart. Recent advancements in electrocardiography include developing even smaller devices for inclusion in fitness trackers and smart watches. These smaller devices often rely on only two electrodes to deliver a single lead I. Portable twelve-lead devices powered by batteries are also available.

Recording an ECG is a safe and painless procedure. The machines are powered by mains power but they are designed with several safety features including an earthed (ground) lead.
Other features include:
* Defibrillation protection: any ECG used in healthcare may be attached to a person who requires defibrillation and the ECG needs to protect itself from this source of energy.
* Electrostatic discharge is similar to defibrillation discharge and requires voltage protection up to 18,000 volts.
* Additionally, circuitry called the right leg driver can be used to reduce common-mode interference (typically the 50 or 60 Hz mains power).
* ECG voltages measured across the body are very small. This low voltage necessitates a low noise circuit, instrumentation amplifiers, and electromagnetic shielding.
* Simultaneous lead recordings: earlier designs recorded each lead sequentially, but current models record multiple leads simultaneously.

Most modern ECG machines include automated interpretation algorithms. This analysis calculates features such as the PR interval, QT interval, corrected QT (QTc) interval, PR axis, QRS axis, rhythm and more. The results from these automated algorithms are considered &quot;preliminary&quot; until verified and/or modified by expert interpretation. Despite recent advances, computer misinterpretation remains a significant problem and can result in clinical mismanagement.

===Cardiac monitors===
Besides the standard electrocardiograph machine, there are other devices capable of recording ECG signals. Portable devices have existed since the Holter monitor was introduced in 1962.
Traditionally, these monitors have used electrodes with patches on the skin to record the ECG, but new devices can stick to the chest as a single patch without need for wires, developed by Zio (Zio XT), TZ Medical (Trident), Philips (BioTel) and BardyDx (CAM) among many others.
Implantable devices such as the artificial cardiac pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator are capable of measuring a &quot;far field&quot; signal between the leads in the heart and the implanted battery/generator that resembles an ECG signal (technically, the signal recorded in the heart is called an electrogram, which is interpreted differently).
Advancement of the Holter monitor became the implantable loop recorder that performs the same function but in an implantable device with batteries that last on the order of years.

Additionally, there are available various Arduino kits with ECG sensor modules and smartwatch devices that are capable of recording an ECG signal as well, such as with the 4th generation Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and newer devices.

==Electrodes and leads==


Electrodes are the actual conductive pads attached to the body surface. Any pair of electrodes can measure the electrical potential difference between the two corresponding locations of attachment. Such a pair forms &quot;a lead&quot;. However, &quot;leads&quot; can also be formed between a physical electrode and a &quot;virtual electrode,&quot; known as Wilson&#x27;s central terminal (WCT), whose potential is defined as the average potential measured by three limb electrodes that are attached to the right arm, the left arm, and the left foot, respectively.

Commonly, 10 electrodes attached to the body are used to form 12 ECG leads, with each lead measuring a specific electrical potential difference (as listed in the table below).

=== Electrodes applied to patient&#x27;s body ===
Leads are broken down into three types: limb; augmented limb; and precordial or chest. The 12-lead ECG has a total of three &quot;limb leads&quot; and three &quot;augmented limb leads&quot; arranged like spokes of a wheel in the coronal plane (vertical), and six &quot;precordial leads&quot; or &quot;chest leads&quot; that lie on the perpendicular transverse plane (horizontal).

Leads should be placed in standard positions. Exceptions due to emergency or other issues should be recorded to avoid erroneous analysis.

The 12 standard ECG leads are listed below. All leads are effectively bipolar, with one positive and one negative electrode; the term &quot;unipolar&quot; is not useful.

Two types of electrodes in common use are a flat paper-thin sticker and a self-adhesive circular pad.
The former are typically used in a single ECG recording while the latter are for continuous recordings as they stick longer.
Each electrode consists of an electrically conductive electrolyte gel and a silver/silver chloride conductor.
The gel typically contains potassium chloride – sometimes silver chloride as well – to permit electron conduction from the skin to the wire and to the electrocardiogram.

The common virtual electrode, known as Wilson&#x27;s central terminal (VW), is produced by averaging the measurements from the electrodes RA, LA, and LL to give an average potential of the body:
:formula_1
In a 12-lead ECG, all leads except the limb leads are assumed to be unipolar (aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6).
The measurement of a voltage requires two contacts and so, electrically, the unipolar leads are measured from the common lead (negative) and the unipolar lead (positive).
This averaging for the common lead and the abstract unipolar lead concept makes for a more challenging understanding and is complicated by sloppy usage of &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;electrode&quot;.
In fact, instead of being a constant reference, VW has a value that fluctuates throughout the heart cycle. It also does not truly represent the center-of-heart potential due to the body parts the signals travel through. Because voltage is by definition a bipolar measurement between two points, describing an electrocardiographic lead as &quot;unipolar&quot; makes little sense electrically and should be avoided. The American Heart Association states &quot;All leads are effectively &#x27;bipolar,&#x27; and the term &#x27;unipolar&#x27; in description of the augmented limb leads and the precordial leads lacks precision.&quot;

===Limb leads===
Leads I, II and III are called the &quot;limb leads&quot;. The electrodes that form these signals are located on the limbs – one on each arm and one on the left leg. The limb leads form the points of what is known as Einthoven&#x27;s triangle.
* Lead I is the voltage between the (positive) left arm (LA) electrode and right arm (RA) electrode:
:formula_2
* Lead II is the voltage between the (positive) left leg (LL) electrode and the right arm (RA) electrode:
:formula_3
* Lead III is the voltage between the (positive) left leg (LL) electrode and the left arm (LA) electrode:
:formula_4

===Augmented limb leads===
Leads aVR, aVL, and aVF are the &quot;augmented limb leads&quot;. They are derived from the same three electrodes as leads I, II, and III, but they use Goldberger&#x27;s central terminal as their negative pole. Goldberger&#x27;s central terminal is a combination of inputs from two limb electrodes, with a different combination for each augmented lead. It is referred to immediately below as &quot;the negative pole&quot;.
* Lead &quot;augmented vector right&quot; (aVR) has the positive electrode on the right arm. The negative pole is a combination of the left arm electrode and the left leg electrode: formula_5
* Lead &quot;augmented vector left&quot; (aVL) has the positive electrode on the left arm. The negative pole is a combination of the right arm electrode and the left leg electrode: formula_6
* Lead &quot;augmented vector foot&quot; (aVF) has the positive electrode on the left leg. The negative pole is a combination of the right arm electrode and the left arm electrode: formula_7

Together with leads I, II, and III, augmented limb leads aVR, aVL, and aVF form the basis of the hexaxial reference system, which is used to calculate the heart&#x27;s electrical axis in the frontal plane.

Older versions of the nodes (VR, VL, VF) use Wilson&#x27;s central terminal as the negative pole, but the amplitude is too small for the thick lines of old ECG machines. The Goldberger terminals scale up (augments) the Wilson results by 50%, at the cost of sacrificing physical correctness by not having the same negative pole for all three.

===Precordial leads===
The &quot;precordial leads&quot; lie in the transverse (horizontal) plane, perpendicular to the other six leads. The six precordial electrodes act as the positive poles for the six corresponding precordial leads: (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6). Wilson&#x27;s central terminal is used as the negative pole. Recently, unipolar precordial leads have been used to create bipolar precordial leads that explore the right to left axis in the horizontal plane.

===Specialized leads===
Additional electrodes may rarely be placed to generate other leads for specific diagnostic purposes. &quot;Right-sided&quot; precordial leads may be used to better study pathology of the right ventricle or for dextrocardia (and are denoted with an R (e.g., V5R). &quot;Posterior leads&quot; (V7 to V9) may be used to demonstrate the presence of a posterior myocardial infarction. The Lewis lead or S5-lead (requiring an electrode at the right sternal border in the second intercostal space) can be used to better detect atrial activity in relation to that of the ventricles.

An &quot;esophageal lead&quot; can be inserted to a part of the esophagus where the distance to the posterior wall of the left atrium is only approximately 5–6 mm (remaining constant in people of different age and weight). An esophageal lead avails for a more accurate differentiation between certain cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial flutter, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. It can also evaluate the risk in people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, as well as terminate supraventricular tachycardia caused by re-entry.

An intracardiac electrogram (ICEG) is essentially an ECG with some added &quot;intracardiac leads&quot; (that is, inside the heart). The standard ECG leads (external leads) are I, II, III, aVL, V1, and V6. Two to four intracardiac leads are added via cardiac catheterization. The word &quot;electrogram&quot; (EGM) without further specification usually means an intracardiac electrogram.

===Lead locations on an ECG report===
A standard 12-lead ECG report (an electrocardiograph) shows a 2.5 second tracing of each of the twelve leads. The tracings are most commonly arranged in a grid of four columns and three rows. The first column is the limb leads (I, II, and III), the second column is the augmented limb leads (aVR, aVL, and aVF), and the last two columns are the precordial leads (V1 to V6).
Additionally, a rhythm strip may be included as a fourth or fifth row.

The timing across the page is continuous and notes tracings of the 12 leads for the same time period.
In other words, if the output were traced by needles on paper, each row would switch which leads as the paper is pulled under the needle.
For example, the top row would first trace lead I, then switch to lead aVR, then switch to V1, and then switch to V4, and so none of these four tracings of the leads are from the same time period as they are traced in sequence through time.

===Contiguity of leads===

Each of the 12 ECG leads records the electrical activity of the heart from a different angle, and therefore align with different anatomical areas of the heart. Two leads that look at neighboring anatomical areas are said to be &quot;contiguous&quot;.

In addition, any two precordial leads next to one another are considered to be contiguous. For example, though V4 is an anterior lead and V5 is a lateral lead, they are contiguous because they are next to one another.

==Electrophysiology==
The study of the conduction system of the heart is called cardiac electrophysiology (EP). An EP study is performed via a right-sided cardiac catheterization: a wire with an electrode at its tip is inserted into the right heart chambers from a peripheral vein, and placed in various positions in close proximity to the conduction system so that the electrical activity of that system can be recorded.

Standard catheter positions for an EP study include &quot;high right atrium&quot; or hRA near the sinus node, a &quot;His&quot; across the septal wall of the tricuspid valve to measure bundle of His, a &quot;coronary sinus&quot; into the coronary sinus, and a &quot;right ventricle&quot; in the apex of the right ventricle.

==Interpretation==
Interpretation of the ECG is fundamentally about understanding the electrical conduction system of the heart.
Normal conduction starts and propagates in a predictable pattern, and deviation from this pattern can be a normal variation or be pathological.
An ECG does not equate with mechanical pumping activity of the heart; for example, pulseless electrical activity produces an ECG that should pump blood but no pulses are felt (and constitutes a medical emergency and CPR should be performed).
Ventricular fibrillation produces an ECG but is too dysfunctional to produce a life-sustaining cardiac output. Certain rhythms are known to have good cardiac output and some are known to have bad cardiac output.
Ultimately, an echocardiogram or other anatomical imaging modality is useful in assessing the mechanical function of the heart.

Like all medical tests, what constitutes &quot;normal&quot; is based on population studies. The heartrate range of between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) is considered normal since data shows this to be the usual resting heart rate.

===Theory===

Interpretation of the ECG is ultimately that of pattern recognition.
In order to understand the patterns found, it is helpful to understand the theory of what ECGs represent.
The theory is rooted in electromagnetics and boils down to the four following points:
* depolarization of the heart &quot;toward&quot; the positive electrode produces a positive deflection
* depolarization of the heart &quot;away&quot; from the positive electrode produces a negative deflection
* repolarization of the heart &quot;toward&quot; the positive electrode produces a negative deflection
* repolarization of the heart &quot;away&quot; from the positive electrode produces a positive deflection

Thus, the overall direction of depolarization and repolarization produces positive or negative deflection on each lead&#x27;s trace.
For example, depolarizing from right to left would produce a positive deflection in lead I because the two vectors point in the same direction.
In contrast, that same depolarization would produce minimal deflection in V1 and V2 because the vectors are perpendicular, and this phenomenon is called isoelectric.

Normal rhythm produces four entities – a P wave, a QRS complex, a T wave, and a U wave – that each have a fairly unique pattern.
* The P wave represents atrial depolarization.
* The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization.
* The T wave represents ventricular repolarization.
* The U wave represents papillary muscle repolarization.

Changes in the structure of the heart and its surroundings (including blood composition) change the patterns of these four entities.

The U wave is not typically seen and its absence is generally ignored. Atrial repolarization is typically hidden in the much more prominent QRS complex and normally cannot be seen without additional, specialized electrodes.

===Background grid===
ECGs are normally printed on a grid.
The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents voltage.
The standard values on this grid are shown in the adjacent image at 25mm/sec (or 40ms per mm):
* A small box is 1 mm × 1 mm and represents 0.1 mV × 0.04 seconds.
* A large box is 5 mm × 5 mm and represents 0.5 mV × 0.20 seconds.

The &quot;large&quot; box is represented by a heavier line weight than the small boxes.


The standard printing speed in the United States is 25 mm per sec (5 big boxes per second), but in other countries it can be 50 mm per sec.
Faster speeds such as 100 and 200 mm per sec are used during electrophysiology studies.

Not all aspects of an ECG rely on precise recordings or having a known scaling of amplitude or time.
For example, determining if the tracing is a sinus rhythm only requires feature recognition and matching, and not measurement of amplitudes or times (i.e., the scale of the grids are irrelevant).
An example to the contrary, the voltage requirements of left ventricular hypertrophy require knowing the grid scale.

===Rate and rhythm===
In a normal heart, the heart rate is the rate at which the sinoatrial node depolarizes since it is the source of depolarization of the heart.
Heart rate, like other vital signs such as blood pressure and respiratory rate, change with age.
In adults, a normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm (normocardic), whereas it is higher in children.
A heart rate below normal is called &quot;bradycardia&quot; (&lt;60 in adults) and above normal is called &quot;tachycardia&quot; (&gt;100 in adults).
A complication of this is when the atria and ventricles are not in synchrony and the &quot;heart rate&quot; must be specified as atrial or ventricular (e.g., the ventricular rate in ventricular fibrillation is 300–600 bpm, whereas the atrial rate can be normal [60–100] or faster [100–150]).

In normal resting hearts, the physiologic rhythm of the heart is normal sinus rhythm (NSR).
Normal sinus rhythm produces the prototypical pattern of P wave, QRS complex, and T wave.
Generally, deviation from normal sinus rhythm is considered a cardiac arrhythmia.
Thus, the first question in interpreting an ECG is whether or not there is a sinus rhythm.
A criterion for sinus rhythm is that P waves and QRS complexes appear 1-to-1, thus implying that the P wave causes the QRS complex.

Once sinus rhythm is established, or not, the second question is the rate.
For a sinus rhythm, this is either the rate of P waves or QRS complexes since they are 1-to-1.
If the rate is too fast, then it is sinus tachycardia, and if it is too slow, then it is sinus bradycardia.

If it is not a sinus rhythm, then determining the rhythm is necessary before proceeding with further interpretation.
Some arrhythmias with characteristic findings:
* Absent P waves with &quot;irregularly irregular&quot; QRS complexes are the hallmark of atrial fibrillation.
* A &quot;saw tooth&quot; pattern with QRS complexes is the hallmark of atrial flutter.
* A sine wave pattern is the hallmark of ventricular flutter.
* Absent P waves with wide QRS complexes and a fast heart rate are ventricular tachycardia.

Determination of rate and rhythm is necessary in order to make sense of further interpretation.

===Axis===

The heart has several axes, but the most common by far is the axis of the QRS complex (references to &quot;the axis&quot; imply the QRS axis).
Each axis can be computationally determined to result in a number representing degrees of deviation from zero, or it can be categorized into a few types.

The QRS axis is the general direction of the ventricular depolarization wavefront (or mean electrical vector) in the frontal plane.
It is often sufficient to classify the axis as one of three types: normal, left deviated, or right deviated.
Population data shows that a normal QRS axis is from −30° to 105°, with 0° being along lead I and positive being inferior and negative being superior (best understood graphically as the hexaxial reference system).
Beyond +105° is right axis deviation and beyond −30° is left axis deviation (the third quadrant of −90° to −180° is very rare and is an indeterminate axis).
A shortcut for determining if the QRS axis is normal is if the QRS complex is mostly positive in lead I and lead II (or lead I and aVF if +90° is the upper limit of normal).

The normal QRS axis is generally &quot;down and to the left&quot;, following the anatomical orientation of the heart within the chest. An abnormal axis suggests a change in the physical shape and orientation of the heart or a defect in its conduction system that causes the ventricles to depolarize in an abnormal way.

The extent of a normal axis can be +90° or 105° depending on the source.

===Amplitudes and intervals===
All of the waves on an ECG tracing and the intervals between them have a predictable time duration, a range of acceptable amplitudes (voltages), and a typical morphology. Any deviation from the normal tracing is potentially pathological and therefore of clinical significance.

For ease of measuring the amplitudes and intervals, an ECG is printed on graph paper at a standard scale: each 1 mm (one small box on the standard 25mm/s ECG paper) represents 40 milliseconds of time on the x-axis, and 0.1 millivolts on the y-axis.
===Time-Frequency Analysis in ECG Signal Processing===
In electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing, Time-Frequency Analysis (TFA) is an important technique used to reveal how the frequency characteristics of ECG signals change over time, especially in non-stationary signals such as arrhythmias or transient cardiac events.

Common Methods for Time-Frequency Analysis
Steps for Time-Frequency Analysis

Step1: Preprocessing
* Signal Denoising: Use wavelet denoising, band-pass filtering (0.5–50 Hz), or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to remove electromyographic (EMG) noise.
* Signal Segmentation: Segment the signal based on heartbeat cycles (e.g., R-wave detection).
Step2: Select an Appropriate TFA Method
* Choose methods such as STFT, WT, or HHT based on the application requirements.
Step3: Compute the Time-Frequency Spectrum
* Calculate the time-frequency distribution using the selected method to generate a time-frequency representation.
Step4: Feature Extraction
* Extract power features from specific frequency bands, such as low-frequency (LF: 0.04–0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF: 0.15–0.4 Hz) components.
Step5: Pattern Recognition or Diagnosis
* Apply machine learning or deep learning models to detect or classify cardiac events based on the time-frequency features.
Application Scenarios

Heart Rate Variability Analysis (HRV):
* Time-frequency analysis helps to separate sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity.

Atrial Fibrillation Detection:
* Analyze the time-frequency characteristics of atrial activity.

Ventricular Fibrillation Analysis:
* Detect time-frequency changes in high-frequency abnormal components.
=== Limb leads and electrical conduction through the heart ===

The animation shown to the right illustrates how the path of electrical conduction gives rise to the ECG waves in the limb leads. 
What is green zone ?
Recall that a positive current (as created by depolarization of cardiac cells) traveling towards the positive electrode and away from the negative electrode creates a positive deflection on the ECG. Likewise, a positive current traveling away from the positive electrode and towards the negative electrode creates a negative deflection on the ECG. The red arrow represents the overall direction of travel of the depolarization. The magnitude of the red arrow is proportional to the amount of tissue being depolarized at that instance. The red arrow is simultaneously shown on the axis of each of the 3 limb leads. Both the direction and the magnitude of the red arrow&#x27;s projection onto the axis of each limb lead is shown with blue arrows. Then, the direction and magnitude of the blue arrows are what theoretically determine the deflections on the ECG. For example, as a blue arrow on the axis for Lead I moves from the negative electrode, to the right, towards the positive electrode, the ECG line rises, creating an upward wave. As the blue arrow on the axis for Lead I moves to the left, a downward wave is created. The greater the magnitude of the blue arrow, the greater the deflection on the ECG for that particular limb lead.

Frames 1–3 depict the depolarization being generated in and spreading through the sinoatrial node. The SA node is too small for its depolarization to be detected on most ECGs. Frames 4–10 depict the depolarization traveling through the atria, towards the atrioventricular node. During frame 7, the depolarization is traveling through the largest amount of tissue in the atria, which creates the highest point in the P wave. Frames 11–12 depict the depolarization traveling through the AV node. Like the SA node, the AV node is too small for the depolarization of its tissue to be detected on most ECGs. This creates the flat PR segment.

Frame 13 depicts an interesting phenomenon in an over-simplified fashion. It depicts the depolarization as it starts to travel down the interventricular septum, through the bundle of His and bundle branches. After the Bundle of His, the conduction system splits into the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch. Both branches conduct action potentials at about 1 m/s. However, the action potential starts traveling down the left bundle branch about 5 milliseconds before it starts traveling down the right bundle branch, as depicted by frame 13. This causes the depolarization of the interventricular septum tissue to spread from left to right, as depicted by the red arrow in frame 14. In some cases, this gives rise to a negative deflection after the PR interval, creating a Q wave such as the one seen in lead I in the animation to the right. Depending on the mean electrical axis of the heart, this phenomenon can result in a Q wave in lead II as well.

Following depolarization of the interventricular septum, the depolarization travels towards the apex of the heart. This is depicted by frames 15–17 and results in a positive deflection on all three limb leads, which creates the R wave. Frames 18–21 then depict the depolarization as it travels throughout both ventricles from the apex of the heart, following the action potential in the Purkinje fibers. This phenomenon creates a negative deflection in all three limb leads, forming the S wave on the ECG. Repolarization of the atria occurs at the same time as the generation of the QRS complex, but it is not detected by the ECG since the tissue mass of the ventricles is so much larger than that of the atria. Ventricular contraction occurs between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. During this time, there is no movement of charge, so no deflection is created on the ECG. This results in the flat ST segment after the S wave.

Frames 24–28 in the animation depict repolarization of the ventricles. The epicardium is the first layer of the ventricles to repolarize, followed by the myocardium. The endocardium is the last layer to repolarize. The plateau phase of depolarization has been shown to last longer in endocardial cells than in epicardial cells. This causes repolarization to start from the apex of the heart and move upwards. Since repolarization is the spread of negative current as membrane potentials decrease back down to the resting membrane potential, the red arrow in the animation is pointing in the direction opposite of the repolarization. This therefore creates a positive deflection in the ECG, and creates the T wave.

===Ischemia and infarction===

Ischemia or non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions (non-STEMIs) may manifest as ST depression or inversion of T waves. It may also affect the high frequency band of the QRS.

ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) have different characteristic ECG findings based on the amount of time elapsed since the MI first occurred. The earliest sign is &quot;hyperacute T waves,&quot; peaked T waves due to local hyperkalemia in ischemic myocardium. This then progresses over a period of minutes to elevations of the ST segment by at least 1 mm. Over a period of hours, a pathologic Q wave may appear and the T wave will invert. Over a period of days the ST elevation will resolve. Pathologic Q waves generally will remain permanently.

The coronary artery that has been occluded can be identified in an STEMI based on the location of ST elevation. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery supplies the anterior wall of the heart, and therefore causes ST elevations in anterior leads (V1 and V2). The LCx supplies the lateral aspect of the heart and therefore causes ST elevations in lateral leads (I, aVL and V6). The right coronary artery (RCA) usually supplies the inferior aspect of the heart, and therefore causes ST elevations in inferior leads (II, III and aVF).

===Artifacts===
An ECG tracing is affected by patient motion. Some rhythmic motions (such as shivering or tremors) can create the illusion of cardiac arrhythmia. Artifacts are distorted signals caused by a secondary internal or external sources, such as muscle movement or interference from an electrical device.

Distortion poses significant challenges to healthcare providers, who employ various techniques and strategies to safely recognize these false signals. Accurately separating the ECG artifact from the true ECG signal can have a significant impact on patient outcomes and legal liabilities.

Improper lead placement (for example, reversing two of the limb leads) has been estimated to occur in 0.4% to 4% of all ECG recordings, and has resulted in improper diagnosis and treatment including unnecessary use of thrombolytic therapy.

=== A Method for Interpretation ===
Whitbread, consultant nurse and paramedic, suggests ten rules of the normal ECG, deviation from which is likely to indicate pathology. These have been added to, creating the 15 rules for 12-lead (and 15- or 18-lead) interpretation.

Rule 1: All waves in aVR are negative.

Rule 2: The ST segment (J point) starts on the isoelectric line (except in V1 &amp; V2 where it may be elevated by not greater than 1 mm).

Rule 3: The PR interval should be 0.12–0.2 seconds long.

Rule 4: The QRS complex should not exceed 0.11–0.12 seconds.

Rule 5: The QRS and T waves tend to have the same general direction in the limb leads.

Rule 6: The R wave in the precordial (chest) leads grows from V1 to at least V4 where it may or may not decline again.

Rule 7: The QRS is mainly upright in I and II.

Rule 8: The P wave is upright in I II and V2 to V6.

Rule 9: There is no Q wave or only a small q (&lt;0.04 seconds in width) in I, II and V2 to V6.

Rule 10: The T wave is upright in I II and V2 to V6. The end of the T wave should not drop below the isoelectric baseline.

Rule 11: Does the deepest S wave in V1 plus the tallest R wave in V5 or V6 equal &gt;35 mm?

Rule 12: Is there an Epsilon wave?

Rule 13: Is there an J wave?

Rule 14: Is there a Delta wave?

Rule 15: Are there any patterns representing an occlusive myocardial infarction (OMI)?

==Diagnosis==
Numerous diagnoses and findings can be made based upon electrocardiography, and many are discussed above. Overall, the diagnoses are made based on the patterns. For example, an &quot;irregularly irregular&quot; QRS complex without P waves is the hallmark of atrial fibrillation; however, other findings can be present as well, such as a bundle branch block that alters the shape of the QRS complexes. ECGs can be interpreted in isolation but should be applied – like all diagnostic tests – in the context of the patient. For example, an observation of peaked T waves is not sufficient to diagnose hyperkalemia; such a diagnosis should be verified by measuring the blood potassium level. Conversely, a discovery of hyperkalemia should be followed by an ECG for manifestations such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and loss of P waves.

==History==
* In 1872, Alexander Muirhead is reported to have attached wires to the wrist of a patient with fever to obtain an electronic record of their heartbeat.
* In 1882, John Burdon-Sanderson working with frogs, was the first to appreciate that the interval between variations in potential was not electrically quiescent and coined the term &quot;isoelectric interval&quot; for this period.
* In 1887, Augustus Waller invented an ECG machine consisting of a Lippmann capillary electrometer fixed to a projector. The trace from the heartbeat was projected onto a photographic plate that was itself fixed to a toy train. This allowed a heartbeat to be recorded in real time.
* In 1895, Willem Einthoven assigned the letters P, Q, R, S, and T to the deflections in the theoretical waveform he created using equations which corrected the actual waveform obtained by the capillary electrometer to compensate for the imprecision of that instrument. Using letters different from A, B, C, and D (the letters used for the capillary electrometer&#x27;s waveform) facilitated comparison when the uncorrected and corrected lines were drawn on the same graph. Einthoven probably chose the initial letter P to follow the example set by Descartes in geometry. When a more precise waveform was obtained using the string galvanometer, which matched the corrected capillary electrometer waveform, he continued to use the letters P, Q, R, S, and T, and these letters are still in use today. Einthoven also described the electrocardiographic features of a number of cardiovascular disorders.
* In 1897, the string galvanometer was invented by the French engineer Clément Ader.
* In 1901, Einthoven, working in Leiden, the Netherlands, used the string galvanometer: the first practical ECG. This device was much more sensitive than the capillary electrometer Waller used.
* In 1924, Einthoven was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his pioneering work in developing the ECG.
* By 1927, General Electric had developed a portable apparatus that could produce electrocardiograms without the use of the string galvanometer. This device instead combined amplifier tubes similar to those used in a radio with an internal lamp and a moving mirror that directed the tracing of the electric pulses onto film.
* In 1937, Taro Takemi invented a new portable electrocardiograph machine.
* In 1942, Emanuel Goldberger increases the voltage of Wilson&#x27;s unipolar leads by 50% and creates the augmented limb leads aVR, aVL and aVF. When added to Einthoven&#x27;s three limb leads and the six chest leads we arrive at the 12-lead electrocardiogram that is used today.
* In the late 1940s, Rune Elmqvist invented an inkjet printer involving thin jets of ink deflected by electrical potentials from the heart, with good frequency response and direct recording of ECG on paper. The device, called the Mingograf, was sold by Siemens Elema until the 1990s.

=== Etymology ===
The word is derived from the Greek &quot;electro&quot;, meaning related to electrical activity; &quot;kardia&quot;, meaning heart; and &quot;graph&quot;, meaning &quot;to write&quot;.

<text>Francisco Javier Varela García (September 7, 1946 – May 28, 2001) was a Chilean biologist, philosopher, cybernetician, and neuroscientist who, together with his mentor Humberto Maturana, is best known for introducing the concept of autopoiesis to biology, and for co-founding the Mind and Life Institute to promote dialog between science and Buddhism.

==Life and career==
Varela was born in 1946 in Talcahuano in Chile, the son of Corina María Elena García Tapia and Raúl Andrés Varela Rodríguez. After completing secondary school at the Liceo Alemán del Verbo Divino in Santiago (1951–1963), like his mentor Humberto Maturana, Varela temporarily studied medicine at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and graduated with a degree in biology from the University of Chile. He later obtained a Ph.D. in biology at Harvard University. His thesis, defended in 1970 and supervised by Torsten Wiesel, was titled &quot;Insect Retinas: Information processing in the compound eye&quot;.

After the 1973 military coup led by Augusto Pinochet, Varela and his family spent 7 years in exile in the United States before he returned to Chile to become a professor of biology at the Universidad de Chile.

Varela became familiar, by practice, with Tibetan Buddhism in the 1970s, initially studying, together with Keun-Tshen Goba (&quot;né&quot; Ezequiel Hernandez Urdaneta), with the meditation master Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, founder of Vajradhatu and Shambhala Training, and later with Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche. 

In 1986, he settled in France, where he first taught cognitive science and epistemology at the École Polytechnique, and later neuroscience at the University of Paris. From 1988 until his death, he led a research group, as Director of Research at the CNRS (Centre National de Recherche Scientifique).

In 1987, Varela, along with R. Adam Engle, founded the Mind and Life Institute, initially to sponsor a series of dialogues between scientists and the Dalai Lama about the relationship between modern science and Buddhism. The Institute continues today as a major nexus for such dialog as well as promoting and supporting multidisciplinary scientific investigation in mind sciences, contemplative scholarship and practice and related areas in the interface of science with meditation and other contemplative practices, especially Buddhist practices.

Varela died in 2001 in Paris of Hepatitis C after having written an account of his 1998 liver transplant. Varela had four children, including the actress, environmental spokesperson, and model Leonor Varela.

==Work and legacy==

Varela was trained as a biologist, mathematician and philosopher through the influence of different teachers, Humberto Maturana and Torsten Wiesel.

He wrote and edited a number of books and numerous journal articles in biology, neurology, cognitive science, mathematics, and philosophy. He founded, with others, the Integral Institute, a thinktank dedicated to the cross-fertilization of ideas and disciplines.

Varela supported embodied philosophy, viewing human cognition and consciousness in terms of the enactive structures in which they arise. These comprise the body (as a biological system and as personally experienced) and the physical world which it enacts.

Varela&#x27;s work popularized within the field of neuroscience the concept of neurophenomenology. This concept combined the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, with &quot;first-person science.&quot; Neurophenomenology requires observers to examine their own conscious experience using scientifically verifiable methods.

In the 1996 popular book &quot;The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems&quot;, physicist Fritjof Capra makes extensive reference to Varela and Maturana&#x27;s theory of autopoiesis as part of a new, systems-based scientific approach for describing the interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena. Written for a general audience, &quot;The Web of Life&quot; helped popularize the work of Varela and Maturana, as well as that of Ilya Prigogine and Gregory Bateson.

Varela&#x27;s 1991 book &quot;The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience&quot;, co-authored with Evan Thompson and Eleanor Rosch, is considered a classic in the field of cognitive science, offering pioneering phenomenological connections and introducing the Buddhism-informed enactivist and embodied cognition approach. A revised edition of &quot;The Embodied Mind&quot; was published in 2017, featuring substantive introductions by the surviving authors, as well as a preface by Jon Kabat-Zinn.

<text>Ewald André Dupont (25 December 1891 – 12 December 1956) was a German film director, one of the pioneers of the German film industry. He was often credited as E. A. Dupont.

==Early life and career==
Born in Zeitz, Saxony and raised in Berlin, DuPont was the son of journalists Hedwig Friedlander and Hermann DuPont, then-editor of &quot;Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung&quot;. After briefly attending the University of Berlin, DuPont began work in 1911 as a reporter, columnist, and, eventually, editor of the &quot;Berliner Allgemeinen Zeitung&quot;. 

A newspaper columnist in 1916, Dupont became a screenwriter and began directing his own crime-story scripts in 1918. After several successes in his native Germany in silent films, he worked in London and in Hollywood, California. One of his greatest successes was the silent film &quot;Varieté&quot; (1925). This film, about an ex-trapeze artist, was noted for its innovative camerawork with highly expressive movement through space, accomplished by the expressionist cinematographer Karl Freund. &quot;Varieté&quot; even did well in the United States, screening for 12 weeks at New York&#x27;s Rialto Theatre.

==United States==
Dupont&#x27;s success was noticed by Carl Laemmle at Universal, who offered Dupont a lucrative contract. His first project was &quot;Love Me and the World Is Mine&quot; in the early summer of 1926, which ran well over budget ($350,000) and was not a success.

==Britain==
Dupont then headed to Britain and made the film &quot;Piccadilly&quot; (1929), a late silent, which is remembered for the central performance of the Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong. &quot;Atlantic&quot; (also 1929) is a retelling of the Titanic disaster and is seen as one of the most innovative uses of sound film technology available at the time. Dupont made several more films in Britain and a few in Germany and France.

==Later career==
After a brief return to Germany, the Jewish director emigrated to the United States in 1933, where he was assigned to several B movies and low budget &quot;programmer&quot; films. Unhappy with the lack of opportunities afforded him in Hollywood, Dupont became a talent agent in 1940.

Dupont returned to filmmaking when he wrote and directed &quot;The Scarf&quot; (1951). In 1952 and 1953, he wrote 23 episodes for the TV series &quot;Big Town&quot; (1950–56) and directed two of those episodes, &quot;Tape Recorder&quot; (19 June 1952) and &quot;The Story of Jerry Baxter&quot; (1 January 1953). Dupont directed several more low-budget films, such as &quot;The Neanderthal Man&quot; (1953).

<text>Tartaric acid is a white, crystalline organic acid that occurs naturally in many fruits, most notably in grapes but also in tamarinds, bananas, avocados, and citrus. Its salt, potassium bitartrate, commonly known as cream of tartar, develops naturally in the process of fermentation. Potassium bitartrate is commonly mixed with sodium bicarbonate and is sold as baking powder used as a leavening agent in food preparation. The acid itself is added to foods as an antioxidant E334 and to impart its distinctive sour taste. Naturally occurring tartaric acid is a useful raw material in organic synthesis. Tartaric acid, an alpha-hydroxy-carboxylic acid, is diprotic and aldaric in acid characteristics and is a dihydroxyl derivative of succinic acid.

==History==
Tartaric acid has been known to winemakers for centuries. However, the chemical process for extraction was developed in 1769 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele.

Tartaric acid played an important role in the discovery of chemical chirality. This property of tartaric acid was first observed in 1832 by Jean Baptiste Biot, who observed its ability to rotate polarized light. Louis Pasteur continued this research in 1847 by investigating the shapes of sodium ammonium tartrate crystals, which he found to be chiral. By manually sorting the differently shaped crystals, Pasteur was the first to produce a pure sample of levotartaric acid.

== Stereochemistry ==
Naturally occurring form of the acid is dextro tartaric acid or -(+)-tartaric acid (obsolete name &quot;d&quot;-tartaric acid). Because it is available naturally, it is cheaper than its enantiomer and the meso isomer. The &quot;dextro&quot; and &quot;levo&quot; prefixes are archaic terms. Modern textbooks refer to the natural form as (2&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;R&quot;)-tartaric acid (-(+)-tartaric acid), and its enantiomer as (2&quot;S&quot;,3&quot;S&quot;)-tartaric acid (D-(-)-tartaric acid). The &quot;meso&quot; diastereomer is referred to as (2&quot;R&quot;,3&quot;S&quot;)-tartaric acid or (2&quot;S&quot;,3&quot;R&quot;)-tartaric acid.

*Dextro and levo form monoclinic sphenoidal crystals and orthorhombic crystals.
*Racemic tartaric acid forms monoclinic and triclinic crystals (space group P). 
*Anhydrous meso tartaric acid form two anhydrous polymorphs: triclinic and orthorhombic.
*Monohydrated meso tartaric acid crystallizes as monoclinic and triclinic polymorphys depending on the temperature at which crystallization from aqueous solution occurs.
Tartaric acid in Fehling&#x27;s solution binds to copper(II) ions, preventing the formation of insoluble hydroxide salts.


==Production==

===-(+)-Tartaric acid===
The -(+)-tartaric acid isomer of tartaric acid is industrially produced in the largest amounts. It is obtained from lees, a solid byproduct of fermentations. The former byproducts mostly consist of potassium bitartrate (). This potassium salt is converted to calcium tartrate () upon treatment with calcium hydroxide ():

In practice, higher yields of calcium tartrate are obtained with the addition of calcium sulfate. Calcium tartrate is then converted to tartaric acid by treating the salt with aqueous sulfuric acid:

===Racemic tartaric acid===
Racemic tartaric acid can be prepared in a multistep reaction from maleic acid. In the first step, the maleic acid is epoxidized by hydrogen peroxide using as a catalyst.

In the next step, the epoxide is hydrolyzed.

===&quot;meso&quot;-Tartaric acid===
A mixture of racemic acid and &quot;meso&quot;-tartaric acid is formed when &quot;dextro&quot;-Tartaric acid is heated in water at 165 °C for about 2 days. &quot;meso&quot;-Tartaric acid can also be prepared from dibromosuccinic acid using silver hydroxide:

&quot;meso&quot;-Tartaric acid can be separated from residual racemic acid by crystallization, the racemate being less soluble.

==Reactivity==
L-(+)-tartaric acid, can participate in several reactions. As shown the reaction scheme below, dihydroxymaleic acid is produced upon treatment of L-(+)-tartaric acid with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a ferrous salt.
:HO2CCH(OH)CH(OH)CO2H + H2O2 → HO2CC(OH)C(OH)CO2H + 2 H2O

Dihydroxymaleic acid can then be oxidized to tartronic acid with nitric acid.

==Derivatives==
Important derivatives of tartaric acid include:
*Sodium ammonium tartrate, the first material separated into its enantiomers
*cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate), used in cooking
*Rochelle salt (potassium sodium tartrate), which has unusual piezoelectric properties
*tartar emetic (antimony potassium tartrate), a resolving agent. Diisopropyl tartrate is used as a co-catalyst in asymmetric synthesis.

Tartaric acid is a muscle toxin, which works by inhibiting the production of malic acid, and in high doses causes paralysis and death. The median lethal dose (LD50) is about 7.5 grams/kg for a human, 5.3 grams/kg for rabbits, and 4.4 grams/kg for mice. Given this figure, it would take over to kill a person weighing with 50% probability, so it may be safely included in many foods, especially sour-tasting sweets. As a food additive, tartaric acid is used as an antioxidant with E number E334; tartrates are other additives serving as antioxidants or emulsifiers.

When cream of tartar is added to water, a suspension results which serves to clean copper coins very well, as the tartrate solution can dissolve the layer of copper(II) oxide present on the surface of the coin. The resulting copper(II)-tartrate complex is easily soluble in water.

==Tartaric acid in wine==

Tartaric acid may be most immediately recognizable to wine drinkers as the source of &quot;wine diamonds&quot;, the small potassium bitartrate crystals that sometimes form spontaneously on the cork or bottom of the bottle. These &quot;tartrates&quot; are harmless, despite sometimes being mistaken for broken glass, and are prevented in many wines through cold stabilization (which is not always preferred since it can change the wine&#x27;s profile). The tartrates remaining on the inside of aging barrels were at one time a major industrial source of potassium bitartrate.

Tartaric acid plays an important role chemically, lowering the pH of fermenting &quot;must&quot; to a level where many undesirable spoilage bacteria cannot live, and acting as a preservative after fermentation. In the mouth, tartaric acid provides some of the tartness in the wine, although citric and malic acids also play a role.

== Tartaric acid in fruits ==
Grapes and tamarinds have the highest levels of tartaric acid concentration. Other fruits with tartaric acid are bananas, avocados, prickly pear fruit, apples, cherries, papayas, peaches, pears, pineapples, strawberries, mangoes and citrus fruits.

Trace amounts of tartaric acid have been found in cranberries and other berries.

Tartaric acid is also present in the leaves and pods of Pelargonium plants and beans.

== Applications ==
Tartaric acid and its derivatives have a plethora of uses in the field of pharmaceuticals. For example, it has been used in the production of effervescent salts, in combination with citric acid, to improve the taste of oral medications. The potassium antimonyl derivative of the acid known as tartar emetic is included, in small doses, in cough syrup as an expectorant.

Tartaric acid also has several applications for industrial use. The acid has been observed to chelate metal ions such as calcium and magnesium. Therefore, the acid has served in the farming and metal industries as a chelating agent for complexing micronutrients in soil fertilizer and for cleaning metal surfaces consisting of aluminium, copper, iron, and alloys of these metals, respectively.

== Toxicity in canines ==
While tartaric acid is well-tolerated by humans and lab animals, an April 2021 letter to the editor of &quot;JAVMA&quot; hypothesized that the tartaric acid in grapes could be the cause of grape and raisin toxicity in dogs. Other studies have observed tartaric acid toxicity in kidney cells of dogs, but not in human kidney cells.

In dogs, the tartaric acid of tamarind causes acute kidney injury, which can often be fatal.

A review identified a relationship between grape ingestion and illness, though the specific type or quantity of grapes that cause toxicity remains unclear. Grape ingestion commonly leads to gastrointestinal and/or renal issues, with treatment depending on the symptoms; outcomes can vary.
