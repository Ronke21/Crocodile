<text>The Human Comedy is a 1943 novel by William Saroyan. It originated as a 240-page film script written for MGM. Saroyan was planning to produce and direct the film, but he was dropped from the project either because the script was too long or because a short film he directed as a test was not considered acceptableor both. He walked off the lot, went home, and swiftly created a novelization, which was published just before the film came out. It was the March 1943 Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and became a best-seller a week after its release. Saroyan won the Academy Award for Best Story for the film, &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;.

==Plot==
Homer Macauley is a 14-year-old boy growing up fatherless in the San Joaquin Valley of California during World War II. His oldest brother, Marcus, is off fighting the war, and Homer feels he needs to be the man of the family. To make money, he takes an evening job as a telegraph boy, meaning sometimes he has to deliver the news to a family that a son has died in the war. Yet Homer keeps up his normal life, going to school, to church, and to the movies. He is encouraged by his home environment and his loving family, including a very young brother and a mother who plays the harp. His roots and an almost instinctive sense of right and wrong keep him honest and hopeful. The novel&#x27;s optimistic tone came, at least in part, from starting as a screen-treatment for MGM&#x27;s Louis B. Mayer.

==Characters==
* Homer Macauley – Protagonist, 14-year-old telegraph messenger living in fictional town of Ithaca, California
* Katie Macauley – Homer&#x27;s mother, who plays the harp

* Mr. Spangler – Manager of telegraph station

* Miss Hicks – Homer&#x27;s history teacher, who moralizes during Homer&#x27;s detention
* Hubert Ackley III – Homer&#x27;s rival
* Auggie Gottlieb – Newspaper boy and leader of a neighborhood gang of young boys
* Matthew Macauley – Homer&#x27;s deceased father
* Marcus Macauley – Homer&#x27;s elder brother, enrolled in the Army
* Mr. Ara – Town grocer
* Diana Steed – Mr. Spangler&#x27;s girlfriend
* &quot;Girl on the corner&quot;

==Themes and setting==
The story of &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;, including the characters Homer and Ulysses in particular, is based on Saroyan&#x27;s life, living fatherless with his siblings and his mother. The town in the novel, Ithaca, California, is based on the real town of Fresno, California, Saroyan&#x27;s hometown.

The book contains several references to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, including the use of Homer as the name of the main character in this novel. Homer&#x27;s young brother&#x27;s name, Ulysses, is the Roman form of the name Odysseus, the protagonist of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The books share the theme of returning home. Ithaca is both Homer&#x27;s and Ulysses&#x27; hometown in the novel and Odysseus&#x27; home island in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The name Helen Eliot (a nod to Homer&#x27;s Helen of Troy) is used as the name of the girl that Homer loves. 

The story occurs during World War II.

==Revision==
Dell Paperbacks released a revised edition of the novel in 1966. The revised edition is credited to William Saroyan, with several substantial edits that reduce the story to 192 pages.

==Adaptations==
The film based on Saroyan&#x27;s script, &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;, was released in 1943. 

In 1943, Nick Hoffer drew a newspaper comic strip, &quot;La Comédie Humaine&quot;, based on &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;. It ran in &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, a Québec newspaper. 

An adaption by S. Lee Pogostin aired on television on the &quot;DuPont Show of the Month&quot; in March 1959. Pogostin&#x27;s adaptation was highly praised by the &quot;New York Times&quot;. This production starred Michael J. Pollard and featured narration by Burgess Meredith.

A musical adaptation for the stage, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as a &quot;pop folk opera&quot;, opened at Joseph Papp&#x27;s Public Theatre on December 28, 1983, and eventually transferred to Broadway, where it closed after 19 previews and 13 performances.

In 1992, Richard Klautsch directed an adaptation for the stage by Phil Atlakson at Boise State University that featured Randy Davison. 

A second film version, &quot;Ithaca&quot; (2015), was directed by Meg Ryan. Filming began in Richmond, Virginia and Petersburg, Virginia in July 2014.

<text>In Which We Serve is a 1942 British patriotic war film directed by Noël Coward and David Lean, who made his debut as a director. It was made during the Second World War with the assistance of the Ministry of Information.

The screenplay by Coward was inspired by the exploits of Captain Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was in command of the destroyer when it was sunk during the Battle of Crete.

Coward composed the music as well as starring in the film as the ship&#x27;s captain. The film also starred John Mills, Bernard Miles, Celia Johnson and Richard Attenborough in his first screen role.

&quot;In Which We Serve&quot; received the full backing of the Ministry of Information, which offered advice on what would make good propaganda and facilitated the release of military personnel. The film is a classic example of wartime British cinema through its patriotic imagery of national unity and social cohesion within the context of the war.

==Plot==
The film opens with the narration: &quot;This is the story of a ship&quot;. In 1941 HMS &quot;Torrin&quot; engages German transports in a night-time action during the Battle of Crete, but at dawn, the destroyer comes under attack from German bombers. A critical hit forces the crew to abandon the ship as it rapidly capsizes. Some of the officers and ratings manage to find a life raft while being intermittently strafed by German planes.

The story of the ship is told in flashbacks, using their memories. The first person to reveal his thoughts is Captain Kinross, who recalls the summer of 1939 when the &quot;Torrin&quot; is being rushed into commission as the possibility of war becomes a near certainty.

The Torrin spends a quiet Christmas in the north of Scotland during the Phoney War, but in 1940 it fights its first engagement during the Battle of Narvik. During that action, the ship is struck by a torpedo. The damaged &quot;Torrin&quot; is towed back to port, all the time being harried by dive bombers.

Safely back in harbour, Captain Kinross tells the assembled ship&#x27;s company that during the battle nearly all the crew performed as he would expect, but one man did not. However, he surprises everyone when he says that he let him off with caution as he feels that, as captain, he failed to make him understand his duty.

Returning to the present, the float survivors watch the capsized &quot;Torrin&quot; take on water and slowly sink. The raft is again strafed by German planes and some men are killed or wounded. Shorty Blake recalls in flashback how he met his wife-to-be, Freda, on a train while on leave. She is related to the &quot;Torrin&quot;″s affable Chief Petty Officer Hardy. When both men return to sea, Freda moves in with Hardy&#x27;s wife and mother-in-law.

The &quot;Torrin&quot; participates in the Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (portrayed in the film by the 5th Battalion of the Coldstream Guards). Blake gets a letter to say that Freda has given birth to his son during the Plymouth Blitz, but that Hardy&#x27;s wife and mother-in-law were killed. He has to tell Hardy, who is writing a letter home, the bitter news.

The survivors on the life raft watch the &quot;Torrin&quot; finally sink. Captain Kinross leads a final &quot;three cheers&quot; for the &quot;Torrin&quot;. A British destroyer soon begins rescuing the men. Captain Kinross talks to the survivors and collects addresses from the dying.

Telegrams are sent to the crew&#x27;s loved ones. Kinross addresses the ship&#x27;s survivors in a military depot in Alexandria in Egypt. He tells them that although they lost their ship and many friends, who now &quot;lie together in fifteen hundred fathoms&quot;, he notes that these losses should inspire them to fight even harder in the battles to come. Captain Kinross then shakes hands with all the ratings as they leave the depot. When the last man goes, the emotionally tired captain silently acknowledges his surviving officers before walking away.

An epilogue concludes: Bigger and stronger ships are being launched to avenge the &quot;Torrin&quot;; Britain is an island nation with a proud, indefatigable people; Captain Kinross is now in command of a battleship. Its massive main guns fire at the enemy.

==Cast==
==Production==
Shortly after his play &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; opened in the West End in July 1941, Noël Coward was approached by Anthony Havelock-Allan, who was working with the production company Two Cities Films. Its founder, Filippo Del Giudice, was interested in making a propaganda film and wanted someone well-known to write the screenplay.

===Screenplay development===
Coward agreed to work on the project as long as the subject was the Royal Navy, and he was given complete control.

As the sinking of on 23 May 1941 was still on Coward&#x27;s mind, he decided to use the ship&#x27;s demise as the basis for his script. Mountbatten, aware that there was some public antipathy to his political ambitions, agreed to support the project as long as it was not a conspicuous biography of his own experiences. In order to do research, Coward visited the naval base in Plymouth, where Michael Redgrave, with whom he was in a relationship at the time, was stationed. He also visited Portsmouth and the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow, where he sailed on .

Coward spent the final months of 1941 drafting a screenplay. However, when he submitted it to Havelock-Allan, the producer told him the film would run between eight and nine hours if it was made as written because it included lengthy scenes in Paris, China, and the West Indies. Havelock-Allan told Coward he needed to trim the plot down to the basics by eliminating everything that was not related to the &quot;Torrin&quot; or its crew. Heeding the advice, Coward started his story with the laying of the ship&#x27;s keel in 1939 and concluded it soon after it sank off the coast of Crete. For the speech at the end of the film, when Capt. Kinross addresses the survivors from the &quot;Torrin&quot; in Alexandria, Coward used the real speech that Mountbatten gave to the surviving crew of HMS &quot;Kelly&quot; after they were rescued and taken to Egypt.

===Pre-production roles===
Coward was determined to portray Captain Kinross in the film despite the studio&#x27;s concern that his public &quot;dressing gown and cigarette-holder&quot; persona might make it difficult for audiences to accept him in the role of a tough navy man. Havelock-Allan supported him, although he later called his performance &quot;always interesting, if not quite convincing.&quot; Coward also needed to convince the censors that the sinking of the ship was a crucial scene and not the threat to public morale they perceived it to be.

Coward had experience directing plays, but he was a novice when it came to films, and he knew he needed to surround himself with professionals if the project was to succeed. He had seen and admired Ronald Neame&#x27;s work and he hired him as cinematographer and chief lighting technician. The Italian film director Filippo Del Giudice was released from his internment as an enemy alien to work on the film at Coward&#x27;s insistence. MI5 supplied Ann Elwell as his secretary. She was translating for him as he took on the role of art director and she also did some scriptwriting. Coward could handle the direction of the actors but would be at a loss with the action scenes, so he asked David Lean to supervise the filming of those. &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; proved to be the first of several films on which the two would collaborate.

===Filming===
Shooting began at Denham Studios on 5 February 1942. From the start, Coward was happy to let production crew members take charge in their areas of expertise while he concentrated on directing the actors and creating his own portrayal of Kinross. However, he soon became bored with the mechanics of filmmaking and after six weeks he came to the studio only when scenes in which he appeared were being filmed. At one point, he invited the royal family to the set and newsreel footage of their visit proved to be good publicity for the film.

During the filming, the character of Albert Fosdike, &quot;Shorty&quot; Blake&#x27;s brother-in-law, was recast after actor William Hartnell turned up late for his first day of shooting. Coward berated Hartnell in front of cast and crew for his unprofessionalism. He then made him personally apologise to everyone before sacking him. Michael Anderson, the film&#x27;s first-assistant director, took over the part (credited as &quot;Mickey Anderson&quot;).

Coward was anxious that it succeed, not only because it was his first film project, but because he felt it was his contribution to the war effort and he wanted it to be perceived as such by the public. The première was a gala event held as a benefit for several naval charities and Coward was pleased to see a large presence of military personnel.

Richard Attenborough appeared as a sailor deserting his post under fire. His name and character were omitted from the original release-print credits but were subsequently added.

===Locations===
Interiors were filmed at Denham Studios, in Denham, Buckinghamshire. 
The destroyer played HMS &quot;Torrin&quot;. The Kinross family picnic scene, set during the Battle of Britain in 1940, was filmed on location on the Dunstable Downs in Bedfordshire.

Although the filmmakers took great care to conceal locations because of wartime censorship, scenes were shot at Plymouth&#x27;s naval dockyard in Devon and the naval station on the Isle of Portland. For example, the departure of Blake and Hardy was filmed in front of Devonport&#x27;s original main entrance, the Keyham Dock Gate. Smeaton&#x27;s Tower on the seafront at Plymouth Hoe was used for the shore-leave scenes between Shorty Blake (Mills) and his wife Freda (Kay Walsh).

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was the second most popular movie at the British box office in 1943. (According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the film was the most popular.)

The film was one of the most successful British films ever released in the US, earning $1.8 million in rentals ($ in dollars).

===Critics===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed, &quot;There have been other pictures which have vividly and movingly conveyed in terms of human emotion the cruel realities of this present war. None has yet done it so sharply and so truly as &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;... For the great thing which Mr. Coward has accomplished in this film is a full and complete expression of national fortitude ... Yes, this is truly a picture in which the British may take a wholesome pride and we may regard as an excellent expression of British strength.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a grim tale sincerely picturized and splendidly acted throughout&quot; and added, &quot;Only one important factor calls for criticism. It is that all the details are too prolonged. The author-producer-scriptwriter-composer and co-director gives a fine performance as the captain of the vessel, but acting honors also go to the entire company. Stark realism is the keynote of the writing and depiction, with no glossing of the sacrifices constantly being made by the sailors.&quot;

===Naval response===
Despite largely positive reviews by audiences and critics alike, the film was not well received by some within the Admiralty who dubbed it &quot;In Which We Sink&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
On Christmas Eve 1942 in New York the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures honoured the film as the Best English Language Film of the Year, citing Bernard Miles and John Mills for their performances.

The film was nominated in the 1943 Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay (losing out to &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Princess O&#x27;Rourke&quot; respectively). However, Coward was presented with an Academy Honorary Award for &quot;his outstanding production achievement.&quot;

&quot;In Which We Serve&quot; also won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film (beating &quot;Casablanca&quot;) and the Argentine Film Critics Association Award for Best Foreign Film in 1943.

==Home media==
A Region 2 DVD with a running time of 96 minutes was released by Carlton on 11 October 1999. A Region 1 DVD was released as part of the David Lean Collection by MGM on 7 September 2004. It features subtitles in English, Spanish, and French and an English audio track in Dolby Digital 1.0. In March 2012 The Criterion Collection released &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; on Blu-ray and DVD as part of the &#x27;David Lean Directs Noël Coward&#x27; box set, which includes a short documentary on the making of &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;.

<text>Hagfish, of the class Myxini (also known as Hyperotreti) and order Myxiniformes , are eel-shaped jawless fish (occasionally called slime eels). Hagfish are the only known living animals that have a skull but no vertebral column, although they do have rudimentary vertebrae. Hagfish are marine predators and scavengers who can defend themselves against other larger predators by releasing copious amounts of slime from mucous glands in their skin.

Although their exact relationship to the only other living group of jawless fish, the lampreys, was long the subject of controversy, genetic evidence suggests that hagfish and lampreys are more closely related to each other than to jawed vertebrates, thus forming the clade Cyclostomi. The oldest-known stem group hagfish are known from the Late Carboniferous, around 310 million years ago, with modern representatives first being recorded in the mid-Cretaceous around 100 million years ago.

==Physical characteristics==
===Body features===
Hagfish are typically about in length. The largest-known species is &quot;Eptatretus goliath&quot;, with a specimen recorded at , while &quot;Myxine kuoi&quot; and &quot;Myxine pequenoi&quot; seem to reach no more than . Some have been seen as small as .

Hagfish have elongated, eel-like bodies, and paddle-like tails. The skin is naked and covers the body like a loosely fitting sock. They are generally a dull pink color and look quite worm-like. They have cartilaginous skulls (although the part surrounding the brain is composed primarily of a fibrous sheath) and tooth-like structures composed of keratin. Colors depend on the species, ranging from pink to blue-grey, and black or white spots may be present. Eyes are simple eyespots, not lensed eyes that can resolve images. Hagfish have no true fins and have six or eight barbels around the mouth and a single nostril. Instead of vertically articulating jaws like Gnathostomata (vertebrates with jaws), they have a pair of horizontally moving structures with tooth-like projections for pulling off food. The mouth of the hagfish has two pairs of horny, comb-shaped teeth on a cartilaginous plate that protracts and retracts. These teeth are used to grasp food and draw it toward the pharynx.
Its skin is attached to the body only along the center ridge of the back and at the slime glands, and is filled with close to a third of the body&#x27;s blood volume, giving the impression of a blood-filled sack. It is assumed this is an adaptation to survive predator attacks. The Atlantic hagfish, representative of the subfamily Myxininae, and the Pacific hagfish, representative of the subfamily Eptatretinae, differ in that the latter has muscle fibers embedded in the skin. The resting position of the Pacific hagfish also tends to be coiled, while that of the Atlantic hagfish is stretched.

===Slime===
Hagfish can exude copious quantities of a milky and fibrous slime or mucus, from specialized slime glands. When released in seawater, the slime expands to 10,000 times its original size in 0.4 seconds. This slime that hagfish excrete has very thin fibers that make it more durable and retentive than the slime excreted by other animals. The fibers are made of proteins and also make the slime flexible. If they are caught by a predator, they can quickly release a large amount of slime to escape. If they remain captured, they can tie themselves in an overhand knot, and work their way from the head to the tail of the animal, scraping off the slime and freeing themselves from their captor. Rheological investigations showed that hagfish slime viscosity increases in elongational flow which favors gill clogging of suction feeding fish, while its viscosity decreases in shear which facilitates scraping off the slime by the travelling-knot.

Recently, the slime was reported to entrain water in its keratin-like intermediate filaments excreted by gland thread cells, creating a slow-to-dissipate, viscoelastic substance, rather than a simple gel. It has been shown to impair the function of a predator fish&#x27;s gills. In this case, the hagfish&#x27;s mucus would clog the predator&#x27;s gills, disabling their ability to respire. The predator would release the hagfish to avoid suffocation. Because of the mucus, few marine predators target the hagfish. Other predators of hagfish are varieties of birds or mammals.

Free-swimming hagfish also slime when agitated, and later clear the mucus using the same travelling-knot behavior. The reported gill-clogging effect suggests that the travelling-knot behavior is useful or even necessary to restore the hagfish&#x27;s own gill function after sliming.

Hagfish thread keratin (EsTKα and EsTKγ; and ), the protein that make up its slime filaments, is under investigation as an alternative to spider silk for use in applications such as body armor. These alpha-keratin proteins in hagfish slime transform from an α-helical structure to a stiffer β sheet structure when stretched. With combined draw-processing (stretching) and chemical crosslinking, recombinant slime keratin turns into a very strong fiber with an elastic modulus reaching 20 GPa.

When in 2017 a road accident on U.S. Highway 101 resulted in of hagfish being spilled, they emitted sufficient slime to cover the road and a nearby car.

===Respiration===
A hagfish generally respires by taking in water through its pharynx, past the velar chamber, and bringing the water through the internal gill pouches, which can vary in number from five to 16 pairs, depending on species. The gill pouches open individually, but in&quot; Myxine&quot;, the openings have coalesced, with canals running backwards from each opening under the skin, uniting to form a common aperture on the ventral side known as the branchial opening. The esophagus is also connected to the left branchial opening, which is therefore larger than the right one, through a pharyngocutaneous duct (esophageocutaneous duct), which has no respiratory tissue. This pharyngocutaneous duct is used to clear large particles from the pharynx, a function also partly taking place through the nasopharyngeal canal. In other species, the coalescence of the gill openings is less complete, and in &quot;Bdellostoma&quot;, each pouch opens separately to the outside, as in lampreys. The unidirectional water flow passing the gills is produced by rolling and unrolling velar folds located inside a chamber developed from the nasohypophyseal tract, and is operated by a complex set of muscles inserting into cartilages of the neurocranium, assisted by peristaltic contractions of the gill pouches and their ducts. Hagfish also have a well-developed dermal capillary network that supplies the skin with oxygen when the animal is buried in anoxic mud, as well as a high tolerance for both hypoxia and anoxia, with a well-developed anaerobic metabolism. Members of the group have spent 36 hours in water completely devoid of dissolved oxygen, and made a complete recovery. The skin has also been suggested to be capable of cutaneous respiration.

===Nervous system===

The origins of the vertebrate nervous system are of considerable interest to evolutionary biologists, and cyclostomes (hagfish and lampreys) are an important group for answering this question. The complexity of the hagfish brain has been an issue of debate since the late 19th century, with some morphologists suggesting that they do not possess a cerebellum, while others suggest that it is continuous with the midbrain. It is now considered that the hagfish neuroanatomy is similar to that of lampreys. A common feature of both cyclostomes is the absence of myelin in neurons. The brain of a hagfish has specific parts similar to the brains of other vertebrates. The dorsal and ventral muscles located towards the side of the hagfish body are connected to spinal nerves. The spinal nerves that connect to the muscles of the pharyngeal wall grow individually to reach them.

===Eye===
The hagfish eye lacks a lens, extraocular muscles, and the three motor cranial nerves (III, IV, and VI) found in more complex vertebrates, which is significant to the study of the evolution of more complex eyes. A parietal eye is also absent in extant hagfish. Hagfish eyespots, when present, can detect light, but as far as it is known, none can resolve detailed images. In &quot;Myxine&quot; and &quot;Neomyxine&quot;, the eyes are partly covered by the trunk musculature. Paleontological evidence suggests, however, that the hagfish eye is not plesiomorphic but rather degenerative, as fossils from the Carboniferous have revealed hagfish-like vertebrates with complex eyes. This would suggest that ancestrally Myxini possessed complex eyes.

===Cardiac function, circulation, and fluid balance===
Hagfish are known to have one of the lowest blood pressures among the vertebrates. One of the most primitive types of fluid balance found in animals is among these creatures; whenever a rise in extracellular fluid occurs, the blood pressure rises and this, in turn, is sensed by the kidney, which excretes excess fluid. They also have the highest blood volume to body mass of any chordate, with 17 ml of blood per 100 g of mass.

The hagfish circulatory system has been of considerable interest to evolutionary biologists and present day readers of physiology. Some observers first believed that the hagfish heart was not innervated (as the hearts of jawed vertebrates are), but further investigation revealed that the hagfish does have a true innervated heart. The hagfish circulatory system also includes multiple accessory pumps throughout the body, which are considered auxiliary &quot;hearts&quot;.

Hagfish are the only known vertebrates with osmoregulation isosmotic to their external environment. Their renal function remains poorly described. There is a hypothesis that they excrete ions in bile salts.

===Musculoskeletal system===
Hagfish musculature differs from jawed vertebrates in that they have neither a horizontal septum nor a vertical septum, which in jawed vertebrates are junctions of connective tissue that separate the hypaxial musculature and epaxial musculature. They do, however, have true myomeres and myosepta like all vertebrates. The mechanics of their craniofacial muscles in feeding have been investigated, revealing advantages and disadvantages of their dental plate. In particular, hagfish muscles have increased force and gape size compared to similar-sized jawed vertebrates, but lack the speed amplification given by jawed vertebrates&#x27; muscles, suggesting that jaws are faster acting than hagfish dental plates.


The hagfish skeleton comprises the skull, the notochord, and the caudal fin rays. The first diagram of the hagfish endoskeleton was made by Frederick Cole in 1905. In Cole&#x27;s monograph, he described sections of the skeleton that he termed &quot;pseudo-cartilage&quot;, referring to its distinct properties compared to jawed chordates. The lingual apparatus of hagfish is composed of a cartilage base bearing two teeth-covered plates (dental plates) articulated with a series of large cartilage shafts. The nasal capsule is considerably expanded in hagfish, comprising a fibrous sheath lined with cartilage rings. In contrast to lampreys, the braincase is noncartilaginous. The role of their branchial arches is still highly speculative, as hagfish embryos undergo a caudal shift of the posterior pharyngeal pouches; thus, the branchial arches do not support gills. While parts of the hagfish skull are thought to be homologous with lampreys, they are thought to have very few elements homologous with jawed vertebrates.

==Reproduction==
Very little is known about hagfish reproduction. Obtaining embryos and observing reproductive behavior are difficult due to the deep-sea habitat of many hagfish species. In the wild, females outnumber males, with the exact sex-ratio differing depending on the species. &quot;E. burgeri&quot;, for example, has nearly a 1:1 ratio, while &quot;M. glutinosa&quot; females are significantly more common than males. Some species of hagfish are sexually undifferentiated before maturation, and possess gonadal tissue for both ovaries and testis. It has been suggested that females develop earlier than males, and that this may be the reason for unequal sex ratios. Hagfish testis are relatively small.

Depending on species, females lay from one to 30 tough, yolky eggs. These tend to aggregate due to having Velcro-like tufts at either end. It is unclear how hagfish go about laying eggs, although researchers have proposed three hypotheses based on observations of the low percentage of males and small testis. The hypotheses are that female hagfish lay eggs in small crevices in rock formations, the eggs are laid in burrow beneath the sand, and the slime produced by the hagfish is used to hold the eggs in a small area. It is worth noting that no direct evidence has been found to support any of these hypotheses. Hagfish do not have a larval stage, in contrast to lampreys.

Hagfish have a mesonephric kidney and are often neotenic of their pronephric kidney. The kidney(s) are drained via mesonephric/archinephric duct. Unlike many other vertebrates, this duct is separate from the reproductive tract, and the proximal tubule of the nephron is also connected with the coelom, providing lubrication. The single testicle or ovary has no transportation duct. Instead, the gametes are released into the coelom until they find their way to the posterior end of the caudal region, whereby they find an opening in the digestive system.

The hagfish embryo can develop for as long as 11 months before hatching, which is shorter in comparison to other jawless vertebrates. Not much was known about hagfish embryology until recently, when husbandry advances enabled considerable insight into the group&#x27;s evolutionary development. New insights into the evolution of neural crest cells, support the consensus that all vertebrates share these cells, which might be regulated by a common subset of genes. Their genome has a large number of microchromosomes which are lost during the animal&#x27;s development, leaving only the reproductive organs with a complete genome. Hagfish possess gonadotropins which secrete from pituitary glands to the gonads to stimulate development. This suggests that hagfish have an early version of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, a system which once thought to be exclusive to the Gnathostomes.Some species of hagfish reproduce seasonally, stimulated by hormones from their pituitary gland. &quot;E. burgeri&quot; is known to reproduce and migrate annually.

==Feeding==

While polychaete marine worms on or near the sea floor are a major food source, hagfish can feed upon and often even enter and eviscerate the bodies of dead and dying/injured sea creatures much larger than themselves. They are known to devour their prey from the inside. Hagfish have the ability to absorb dissolved organic matter across the skin and gill, which may be an adaptation to a scavenging lifestyle, allowing them to maximize sporadic opportunities for feeding. From an evolutionary perspective, hagfish represent a transitory state between the generalized nutrient absorption pathways of aquatic invertebrates and the more specialized digestive systems of aquatic vertebrates.

Like leeches, they have a sluggish metabolism and can survive months between feedings; their feeding behavior, however, appears quite vigorous. Analysis of the stomach content of several species has revealed a large variety of prey, including polychaetes, shrimp, hermit crabs, cephalopods, brittle stars, bony fishes, sharks, birds, and whale flesh.

In captivity, hagfish are observed to use the overhand-knot behavior in reverse (tail-to-head) to assist them in gaining mechanical advantage to pull out chunks of flesh from carrion fish or cetaceans, eventually making an opening to permit entry to the interior of the body cavity of larger carcasses. A healthy larger sea creature likely would be able to outfight or outswim this sort of assault.

This energetic opportunism on the part of the hagfish can be a great nuisance to fishermen, as they can devour or spoil entire deep drag-netted catches before they can be pulled to the surface. Since hagfish are typically found in large clusters on and near the bottom, a single trawler&#x27;s catch could contain several dozen or even hundreds of hagfish as bycatch, and all the other struggling, captive sea life make easy prey for them.

The digestive tract of the hagfish is unique among chordates because the food in the gut is enclosed in a permeable membrane, analogous to the peritrophic matrix of insects. They are also able to absorb nutrients directly through their skin.

Hagfish have also been observed actively hunting the red bandfish, &quot;Cepola haastii&quot;, in its burrow, possibly using their slime to suffocate the fish before grasping it with their dental plates and dragging it from the burrow.

==Classification==

Originally, &quot;Myxine&quot; was included by Linnaeus (1758) in Vermes. The fossil hagfish &quot;Myxinikela siroka&quot;, from the Late Carboniferous of the United States, is the oldest-known member of the group. It is in some respects more similar to lampreys, but shows key autapomorphies of hagfish. In recent years, hagfish have become of special interest for genetic analysis investigating the relationships among chordates. Their classification as agnathans places hagfish as elementary vertebrates in between invertebrates and gnathostomes. However, discussion has long occurred in scientific literature about whether the hagfish were even invertebrate. Using fossil data, paleontologists posited that lampreys are more closely related to gnathostomes than hagfish. The term &quot;Craniata&quot; was used to refer to animals that had a developed skull, but were not considered true vertebrates. Molecular evidence in the early 1990s first began suggesting that lampreys and hagfish were more closely related to each other than to gnathostomes. The validity of the taxon &quot;Craniata&quot; was further examined by Delarbre et al. (2002) using mtDNA sequence data, concluding the Myxini are more closely related to the Hyperoartia than to the Gnathostomata—i.e., that modern jawless fishes form a clade called the Cyclostomata. The argument is that if the Cyclostomata are indeed monophyletic, Vertebrata would return to its old content (Gnathostomata + Cyclostomata) and the name Craniata, being superfluous, would become a junior synonym. Nowadays, molecular data are almost unanimously in consensus of cyclostome monophyly, with more recent work being directed at shared microRNAs between cyclostomes and gnathostomes. The current classification supported by molecular analyses (which show that lampreys and hagfishes are sister taxa), as well as the fact that hagfishes do, in fact, have rudimentary vertebrae, which places hagfishes in Cyclostomata.

==Phylogeny==
Hagfish are in the group Cyclostomata which includes jawless fish. The group Cyclostomata is characterized by two significant characteristics; keratinous tooth plates and movement of postotic myomeres to the orbitals. According to fossil record, hagfish and lampreys have been estimated to have diverged from one another during the Paleozoic period. An experiment used an estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions for nucleotides and supplemented that data with pre-existing data into a clock that would calculate divergence times for the taxons &quot;Myxine&quot; and &quot;Eptatretus&quot;. This data found that the lineage diverged around 93–28 Mya; however, later studies have found even earlier divergence times within the group, with &quot;Myxine&quot; and &quot;Eptatretus&quot; diverging during the Triassic and the ancestor of &quot;Rubicundus&quot; diverging during other extant hagfishes during the Permian. Hagfish are excluded from the subphylum Gnathostomata because of morphological characteristics including the hagfish arched tongue. Hagfish embryos have characteristics of gnathostomes and may be plesiomorphic; however, these characteristics drastically change morphologically as the hagfish matures. The following hagfish and lamprey phylogeny is an adaptation based on the 2019 work of Miyashita et al.

==Commercial use==
===As food===
In most of the world, hagfish are not often eaten. But in Korea, the hagfish is a valued food, where it is generally skinned, coated in spicy sauce, and grilled over charcoal or stir-fried. It is especially popular in the southern port cities of the peninsula, such as Busan and coastal cities in South Gyeongsang Province. 

Due to their value in Korean cuisine, most hagfish caught for food elsewhere in the world is fished with intent of being exported to South Korea. The inshore hagfish, found in the northwest Pacific, is eaten in Japan and South Korea. As hagfish slime binds vast amounts of liquid even at low temperatures, it was proposed as an energy-saving alternative for the production of tofu that does not require heating.

===In textiles===
The hagfish slime threads can be used as ultra-strong fiber for clothing. Douglas Fudge, of Chapman University, has conducted research in this area.

===Skins===
Hagfish skin, used in a variety of clothing accessories, is usually referred to as &quot;eel skin&quot;. It produces a particularly durable leather, especially suitable for wallets and belts.

<text>Madame Curie is a 1943 American biographical film made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film was directed by Mervyn LeRoy and produced by Sidney Franklin from a screenplay by Paul Osborn, Paul H. Rameau, and Aldous Huxley (uncredited), adapted from the biography by Ève Curie. It stars Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, with supporting performances by Robert Walker, Henry Travers, and Albert Bassermann.

The film tells the story of Polish-French physicist Marie Curie in 1890s Paris as she begins to share a laboratory with her future husband Pierre Curie.

This was the fourth of nine onscreen pairings with Pidgeon and Garson.

In several versions, much of the scientific aspects of the film were cut or removed entirely. Turner Classic Movies has shown it unedited at 124 minutes.

==Plot==

Marie Skłodowska is a poor, idealistic student living in Paris and studying at the Sorbonne. She neglects her health and one day faints during class. Her tutor, Prof. Perot is sympathetic and, finding that she has no friends or family in Paris, invites her to a &quot;soirée&quot; his wife is throwing for a &quot;few friends&quot; (primarily professors and their wives). Among the many guests is physicist Pierre Curie, an extremely shy and absentminded man completely devoted to his work. He allows Marie to share his lab and finds that she is a gifted scientist. Appalled that she plans on returning to Poland to teach after graduation rather than devoting her life to further study, he takes her to visit his family in their country home. Marie and Pierre both tend to concentrate on science to the extent that they don&#x27;t realize until the last minute they have fallen in love. Even when Pierre asks Marie to be his wife, he does so in terms of reason, logic and chemistry.

Fascinated by a demonstration she saw as an undergraduate, of a pitchblende rock that seems to generate enough energy to take small photographs, Marie decides to make the rock&#x27;s energy the subject of her doctoral study. The measurements she takes don&#x27;t seem to add up, and she decides there must be a third radioactive element in the rock in addition to the two she knows are in it. In the midst of discussing this, she discloses offhandedly to Pierre&#x27;s family that she is pregnant.

The physics department at the Sorbonne refuses to fund their research without more proof of the element&#x27;s existence, but allows them to use a dilapidated old shed across the courtyard from the physics building. In spite of its disadvantages, they import eight tons of pitchblende ore and cook it down to look for the element they call radium. In spite of inability to separate out pure radium, they know something is definitely there, as Marie&#x27;s hands are being burned. They hit on a tedious method of crystallization to isolate pure radium. After four years, they find only a stain on the bottom of the dish that should have held the radium. They return to the shed that night and find the dish glowing, confirming that they have isolated the radium.

Now world-famous, they go on vacation to rest after all the press conferences and the Nobel Prize. They&#x27;re granted a new laboratory by the university; before its dedication, Marie shows off her new dress, inspiring Pierre to get her a set of earrings to go with it. Walking home in the rain, he absentmindedly crosses the street in front of a delivery wagon, and he is run down and killed. Marie almost loses her mind, but after the concerned Prof. Perot counsels her, she remembers Pierre&#x27;s words that if one of them is gone, the other must go on working just the same. Finally, Marie gives a speech at the 25th anniversary celebration of the discovery of radium, expressing her belief that science is the path to a better world.

==Cast==
==Production==
Universal Studios quickly bought the rights to Ève Curie&#x27;s book, with Irene Dunne in mind to play Marie. Dunne traveled to Europe and met with Ève Curie to discuss the project, but Universal sold the property to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer a few years later. In March 1938, Anita Loos contacted Aldous Huxley, then recently moved to Hollywood, saying she would put him in touch with MGM for a writing contract. &quot;Madame Curie&quot; was originally set for production in 1941 starring Greta Garbo with George Cukor directing. MGM ultimately rejected Huxley&#x27;s script for &quot;Madame Curie&quot; as &quot;too literary,&quot; and after Garbo&#x27;s success in &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, MGM wanted her to star in another romantic comedy. The project was shelved and Garbo left MGM for good in 1942.

MGM&#x27;s star Joan Crawford was interested in the role Marie as she wanted to play serious characters, but her request was rejected by Mayer. The role went to Greer Garson, and Crawford cited it as a reason to leave MGM and sign to Warner Brothers.

Mervyn LeRoy replaced Albert Lewin, who was fired shortly before production began.

While the film is heavily fictionalized for dramatic purposes, the plot managed to adhere to the facts more than most biopics of the 1930s and 1940s. &quot;Madame Curie&quot; completely omits any mention of Marie&#x27;s family in Paris, including her sister Bronisława, an obstetrician, with whom she was very close. There is also virtually no mention of Marie&#x27;s intense devotion to politics and the liberation/independence of her native Poland.

Author James Hilton was the narrator for this film.

==Box office==
According to MGM records the film earned $2,575,000 in the US and Canada and $2,035,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $1,086,000.

==Accolades==
;Others
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers – #97

==In popular culture==
&quot;Madame Curie&quot; was satirized in a 1976 episode of &quot;SCTV&quot; as &quot;Madame Blitzman&quot; (mistakenly shown on &#x27;Monster Chiller Horror Theater&#x27;) in which Frances Blitzman/Marie Curie (Andrea Martin) works alongside her husband Louis Blitzman/Pierre Curie (Eugene Levy) in creating a life-extension formula derived from radiation exposure. However, Louis suffers from painful recurring headaches which kill him eventually; at a meeting of the &#x27;Academy of Science&#x27;, an aged Frances reveals that Louis&#x27;s experiments caused a plaque to grow in his brain, causing the painful headaches which killed him, and which are also affecting her.

<text>CompuServe, Inc. (CompuServe Information Service, Inc., also known by its initialism CIS or later CSi) was an American Internet company that provided an eponymous online service, the first major commercial one in the world. It opened in 1969 as a timesharing and remote access service marketed to corporations. After a successful 1979 venture selling otherwise under-utilized after-hours time to Radio Shack customers, the system was opened to the public, roughly the same time as The Source.

H&amp;R Block bought the company in 1980 and began to advertise the service aggressively. CompuServe dominated the industry during the 1980s, buying their competitor The Source. One popular use of CompuServe during the 1980s was file exchange, particularly pictures. In 1985, it hosted one of the earliest online comics, &quot;Witches and Stitches&quot;. CompuServe introduced a simple black-and-white image format known as RLE (run-length encoding) to standardize the images so they could be shared among different types of microcomputers. With the introduction of more powerful machines enabling display of color, CompuServe introduced the much more capable Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), invented by Steve Wilhite. GIF later became the most common format for 8-bit images transmitted by Internet during the early and mid-1990s.

At its peak during the early 1990s, CIS had an online chat system, message forums for a variety of topics, extensive software libraries for most personal computers, and a series of popular online games, including &quot;MegaWars III&quot; and &quot;Island of Kesmai&quot;. In 1994, it was described as &quot;the oldest of the Big Three information services (the others are Prodigy and America Online)&quot;. However, the rise of modern systems like AOL, as well as the open World Wide Web system, led to it losing marketshare. In 1997, a complex deal was devised with WorldCom acting as a broker, resulting in the company being sold to AOL. New products under the CompuServe sub-brand ceased in 2002, and the original CompuServe Information Service, later rebranded as CompuServe Classic, was eventually shut down in 2009 after 30 years. The CompuServe website still remains in operation mirroring other current AOL services, which is now under the Yahoo! Inc. banner and owned by Verizon.

==Company history and development of the service==
===Founding===
CompuServe was initiated during 1969 as Compu-Serv Network, Inc. in Columbus, Ohio, as a subsidiary of Golden United Life Insurance.

Though Golden United founder Harry Gard Sr.&#x27;s son-in-law Jeffrey Wilkins is widely miscredited as the first president of CompuServe, its first president was actually John R. Goltz. Wilkins replaced Goltz as CEO within the first year of operation. Goltz and Wilkins were both graduate students of electrical engineering at the University of Arizona. Other early recruits from the same University included Sandy Trevor (inventor of the CompuServe CB Simulator chat system), Doug Chinnock, and Larry Shelley.

The company&#x27;s objectives were twofold: to provide in-house computer processing for Golden United Life Insurance; and to develop as an independent business in the computer time-sharing industry, by renting time on its PDP-10 midrange computers during business hours, mainly to other businesses. It was divested as a separate company during 1975, trading on the NASDAQ using the symbol CMPU.

Concurrently, the company recruited executives who changed the emphasis from offering time-sharing services, for which customers wrote their own applications, to a service providing application programs. The first of these new executives was Robert Tillson, who quit Service Bureau Corporation (then a subsidiary of Control Data Corporation, but originally formed as a division of IBM) to become CompuServe&#x27;s Executive Vice President of Marketing. He then recruited Charles McCall (who succeeded Jeff Wilkins as CEO, and later became CEO of the medical information company HBO &amp; Co.), Maury Cox (who became CEO after the departure of McCall), and Robert Massey (who succeeded Cox as CEO).

In 1977, CompuServe&#x27;s board changed the company&#x27;s name to CompuServe Incorporated. In 1979, it began &quot;offering a dial-up online information service to consumers&quot;. In May 1980, at which time Compuserve had fewer than 1,000 subscribers to its consumer information service, H&amp;R Block acquired the company for $25 million and within four years had grown its subscriber base to about 110,000.

===Technology===
The original 1969 dial-up technology was fairly simple—the local telephone number in Cleveland, for example, was a line connected to a time-division multiplexer that connected via a leased line to a matched multiplexer in Columbus that was connected to a time-sharing host system. In the earliest buildups, each line terminated at a single machine of CompuServe&#x27;s host service, so that one dialed different telephone numbers to reach different computers.

Later, the central multiplexers in Columbus were replaced with PDP-8 minicomputers, and the PDP-8s were connected to a DEC PDP-15 minicomputer that acted as switches so a telephone number was not tied to a particular destination host. Finally, in 1977, CompuServe developed its own packet switching network, implemented by DEC PDP-11 minicomputers acting as network nodes that were installed throughout the United States (and later, in other countries) and interconnected. Over time, the CompuServe network evolved into a complicated multi-tiered network incorporating Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay (FR), Internet Protocol (IP) and X.25 technologies.

In 1981, &quot;The Times&quot; explained CompuServe&#x27;s technology in one sentence:

CompuServe is offering a video-text-like service permitting personal computer users to retrieve software from the mainframe computer over telephone lines.
&quot;The New York Times&quot; described them as &quot;the most international of the Big Three&quot; and noted that &quot;it can be reached by a local phone call in more than 700 cities&quot;.

CompuServe was also a vendor of other commercial services. One of these was the Financial Services group, which collected and consolidated financial data from myriad data feeds, including CompuStat, Disclosure, I/B/E/S as well as the price and quote feeds from the major exchanges. CompuServe developed extensive screening and reporting programs that were used by many investment banks on Wall Street.

===CIS===
In 1979, Radio Shack marketed the residential information service MicroNET, in which home users accessed the computers during evening hours when the CompuServe computers were otherwise idle. This was a success and CompuServe began to advertize it more widely, as &quot;MicroNET, CompuServe&#x27;s Personal Computing Division&quot;. Its success prompted CompuServe to disuse the MicroNET name in favor of its own, becoming CompuServe Information Service, or CIS. CIS&#x27; 1979 origin was approximately concurrent with that of The Source.

By the mid-1980s, CompuServe was one of the largest information and networking services companies, and it was the largest consumer information service. It operated commercial branches in more than 30 US cities, selling primarily network services to major corporations throughout the United States. Consumer accounts could be bought in most computer stores (a box with an instruction manual and a trial account login) and this service was well known to the public. By 1987, consumer business would provide 50% of CompuServe revenues.

The corporate culture was entrepreneurial, encouraging &quot;skunkworks projects&quot;. Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Trevor secluded himself for a weekend, writing the &quot;CB Simulator&quot;, a chat system that soon became one of CIS&#x27;s most popular features. Instead of hiring employees to manage the forums, they contracted with systems operators (sysops), who received compensation based on the success of their own forum&#x27;s boards, libraries, and chat areas.

===Newspapers===
In July 1980, working with &quot;Associated Press&quot;, CompuServe began hosting text versions of the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Virginian-Pilot and Ledger Star&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; were added in 1981; additional newspapers followed.

Although accessing articles in these newspapers comprised 5% of CompuServe&#x27;s traffic, reading an entire newspaper using this method was impractical; the text of a $0.20 print edition newspaper would take two to six hours to download at a cost of $5 per hour (after 6 p.m.).

===Selling connectivity===
Another major unit of CompuServe, the CompuServe Network Services, was formed in 1982 to generate revenue by selling connectivity to the nationwide packet network CompuServe had built to support its time-sharing service. CompuServe designed and manufactured its own network processors, based on the DEC PDP-11, and developed all the software that operated on the network. Often (and erroneously) termed an X.25 network, the CompuServe network implemented a mixture of standardized and proprietary layers throughout the network.

One of the proprietary layers was termed Adaptive Routing. The Adaptive Routing system implemented two powerful features. One is that the network operated entirely in a self-discovery mode. When a new switch was added to the network by connecting it to a neighbor via a leased telephone circuit, the new switch was discovered and absorbed into the network without explicit configuration. To change the network configuration, all that was needed was to add or remove connections, and the network would automatically reconfigure. The second feature implemented by Adaptive Routing was often discussed by network engineers, but was implemented only by CNS establishing connection paths on the basis of real-time performance measurements. As one circuit became busy, traffic was diverted to alternative paths to prevent overloading and poor performance for users.

While the CNS network was not itself based on the X.25 protocol, the network presented a standard X.25 interface to customers, providing dial-up connectivity to corporate hosts, and allowing CompuServe to form alliances with private networks Tymnet and Telenet, among others. This gave CompuServe the largest selection of local dial-up telephone connections in the world, in an era when network usage charges were expensive, but still less than long-distance charges. Other networks permitted CompuServe access to still more locations, including international locations, usually with substantial connect-time surcharges. It was common during the early 1980s to pay a $30-per-hour charge to connect to CompuServe, which at the time cost $5 to $6 per hour before factoring in the connection-time surcharges. This resulted in the company being nicknamed &quot;CompuSpend&quot;, &quot;Compu$erve&quot; or &quot;CI$&quot;.

CNS has been the primary supplier of dial-up communications for credit-card authorizations for more than 20 years, a competence developed as a result of its long-time relationship with Visa International. At the peak of this type of business, CompuServe transmitted millions of authorization transactions each month, representing several billion dollars of consumer purchase transactions. For many businesses an always-on connection was an extravagance, and a dial-up option made better sense. This service presently remains in operation, as part of Verizon (see below). There are no other competitors remaining in this market.

The company was notable for introducing a number of online services to personal computer users. CompuServe began offering electronic mail capabilities and technical support to commercial customers in 1978 using the name InfoPlex, and was also a pioneer of the real-time chat market with its CB Simulator service introduced on February 21, 1980, as the first public, commercial multi-user chat program. Introduced in 1985, EaasySABRE, a customer-accessible extension of the Sabre travel system, made it possible for individuals to find and book airline flights and hotel rooms without the help of a travel agent. CompuServe also introduced a number of online games.

===File transfers===
Around 1981, CompuServe introduced its CompuServe B protocol, a file-transfer protocol, allowing users to send files to each other. This was later expanded to the better-performance B+ version, intended for downloads from CIS itself. Although the B+ protocol was not widely supported by other software, it was used by default for some time by CIS itself. The B+ protocol was later extended to include the Host-Micro Interface (HMI), a mechanism for communicating commands and transaction requests to a server application operating on the mainframes. HMI could be used by &quot;front end&quot; client software to present a GUI-based interface to CIS, without having to use the error-prone CLI to route commands.

CompuServe began to expand its business operations outside the United States. It began in Japan in 1986 with Fujitsu and Nissho Iwai, and developed a Japanese-language version of CompuServe named &quot;NIFTY-Serve&quot; in 1989. In 1993, CompuServe Hong Kong was initiated as a joint venture with Hutchison Telecom and was able to acquire 50,000 customers before the dial-up ISP frenzy. Between 1994 and 1995 Fujitsu and CompuServe co-developed WorldsAway, an interactive virtual environment. As of 2014 the original virtual environment that began on CompuServe in 1995, known as the Dreamscape, was still operating.

During the late 1980s, it was possible to log on to CompuServe via worldwide X.25 packet switching networks, which bridged onto CompuServe&#x27;s existing US-based network. It gradually introduced its own direct dial-up access network in many countries, a more economical solution. With its network expansion, CompuServe also extended the marketing of its commercial services, opening branches in London and Munich.

=== CCAC ===
CompuServe, and its outside telecommunications attorney, Randy May, directed appeals to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to exempt data networks from having to pay the common carrier access charge (CCAC) that was levied by the telephone local exchange carriers (primarily the Baby Bell companies) on long-distance carriers. The primary argument was that data networking was a new industry, and the country would be served better by not exposing this important new industry to the aberrations of the voice telephone economics (the CCAC is the mechanism used to subsidize the cost of local telephone service from long-distance revenue). The FCC agreed with CompuServe&#x27;s argument, and the consequence is that all dial-up networking in the United States, whether using private networks or the public internet, is much less expensive than it otherwise would have been.

===Internet===
CompuServe was the first online service to offer Internet connectivity, albeit with limited access, as early as 1989, when it connected its proprietary e-mail service to allow incoming and outgoing messages to be exchanged with Internet-based e-mail addresses.

During the early 1990s, CompuServe had hundreds of thousands of users visiting its thousands of moderated forums, forerunners to the discussion sites of the World Wide Web. (Like the Web, many forums were managed by independent producers who then administered the forum and recruited moderators, termed sysops.) Among these were many in which computer hardware and software companies offered customer assistance. This broadened the audience from primarily business users to the technical &quot;geek&quot; crowd, some of whom had earlier used &quot;Byte Magazine&quot;″s Bix online service.

There were special forums, special groups, but many had &quot;relatively large premiums&quot; (as did &quot;some premium data bases&quot; with charges of &quot;$7.50 each time you enter a search request&quot;.)

In 1992, CompuServe hosted the first known WYSIWYG e-mail content and forum posts. Fonts, colors and emoticons were encoded into 7-bit text-based messages via the third party product NavCIS (by Dvorak Development) operating with the operating systems DOS and Windows 3.1, and later, Windows 95. NavCIS included features for offline work, similar to offline readers used with bulletin board systems, allowing users to connect to the service and exchange new mail and forum content in a largely automated fashion. Once the &quot;run&quot; was complete, the user edited their messages locally while offline. The system also allowed interactive navigation of the system to support services like the chat system. Many of these services remained text based.

CompuServe later introduced CompuServe Information Manager (CIM) to compete more directly with AOL. Unlike Navigator, CIM was adapted for online work, and used a point-and-click interface very similar to AOLs. Later versions interacted with the hosts using the &quot;HMI&quot; communications protocol. For some types of service which were not compatible with HMI, the older text-based interface could be used. WinCIM also allowed caching of forum messages, news articles and e-mail, so that reading and posting could be performed offline, without incurring hourly connection costs. Previously, this was a luxury of the NavCIS, AutoSIG and TapCIS applications for power users.

CIS users could purchase services and software from other CompuServe members using their CompuServe account, something Internet users could not do until the NSFNET lifted the prohibition on commercial Internet use in 1989.

During the early 1990s, the hourly rate decreased from more than $10 per hour to $1.95 per hour. In March 1992, it began online signups with credit card based payments and a desktop application to connect online and check emails. In April 1995, CompuServe had more than three million members, still the largest online service provider, and began its NetLauncher service, providing WWW access capability via Spry, a Mosaic browser. AOL, however, introduced a much cheaper flat-rate, unlimited-time, advertisement-funded price plan in the US to compete with CompuServe&#x27;s hourly charges. In conjunction with AOL&#x27;s marketing campaigns, this caused a significant loss of customers until CompuServe responded with a similar plan of its own at $24.95 per month in late 1997.

As the World Wide Web grew in popularity with the general public, company after company terminated their once-busy CompuServe customer assistance forums to offer customer assistance to a larger audience directly through their own company websites, an activity which the CompuServe forums of the time could not address because they did not yet have universal WWW access.

In 1992, CompuServe acquired Mark Cuban&#x27;s company, MicroSolutions, for $6 million.

AOL&#x27;s entry into the PC market in 1991 marked the beginning of the end for CIS. AOL charged $2.95 an hour versus $5.00 an hour for CompuServe. AOL used a freely available graphical user interface-based client; CompuServe&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t free, and it only had a subset of the system&#x27;s functionality. In response, CIS decreased its hourly rates on several occasions. Subsequently, AOL switched to a monthly subscription instead of hourly rates, so for active users AOL was much less expensive. By late 1994, CompuServe was offering &quot;unlimited use of the standard services (including news, sports, weather) ... and limited electronic mail&quot; for $8.95 per month what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;probably the best deal.&quot;

CIS&#x27;s number of users grew, maximizing in April 1995 at 3 million worldwide. By this time AOL had more than 20 million users in the United States alone, but this was less than their maximum of 27 million, due to customers quitting for lesser-cost offerings. By 1997 the number of users quitting all online services for dial-up Internet service providers was reaching a climax.

In 1997, CompuServe began converting its forums from its proprietary Host-Micro Interface (HMI) to HTML web standards. The 1997 change discontinued text based access to the forums, but the forums were accessible both through the web as well as through CompuServe&#x27;s proprietary HMI protocol. In 2004 CompuServe discontinued HMI and converted the forums to web access only. The forums remained active on CompuServe.com until the end of 2017.

=== Acquisitions ===
CompuServe made a number of acquisitions in its history, both before and after being acquired by H&amp;R Block:

* Early 1970s Alpha Systems of Dallas, Texas, a small regional timesharing company which was also based on PDP-10 technology. It was operated as a standalone company for a brief time, but later their PDP-10 was moved to CompuServe&#x27;s Columbus, Ohio, datacenter and the Dallas operation ended.
* ~1986 Software House developer of System 1022, a relational database system.
* ~1986 Collier-Jackson developer of human resource management products.
* 1988 Access Technology developer of the 20/20 spreadsheet program.
* 1995 Spry, Inc. developer of Internet in a Box, the first consumer internet suite.

== Software and features ==

=== User IDs and e-mail addresses ===
The original CompuServe user identifiers consisted of seven octal digits in the form 7xxxx,xx – a legacy of PDP-10 architecture – (later eight and nine octal digits in the form 7xxxx,xxx and 7xxxx,xxxx and finally ten octal digits in the form 1xxxxx,xxxx) that were generated in advance and issued on printed &quot;Snap Paks&quot;.

From 1989, CompuServe users had email access to the internet, using their user ID in the form xxxxx.xxxx@compuserve.com – where the comma in the original ID was replaced with a period. In 1996, users were allowed to create an alias for their internet e-mail address, which could also be used for a personal webpage; the longest-term members were allowed first choice of the new addresses. In 1998, users were offered the option of switching their mailbox to a newer system that provided POP3 access via the internet, so that any internet email program could be used. Current CompuServe email addresses look like XXXXXX@cs.com for users of the CompuServe 2000 service.

=== Custom portals ===
CompuServe has a long history offering a custom portal of the CompuServe Information Service to the airline industry. Beginning during the 1970s, CompuServe offered a customized version of its service that allowed pilots and flight attendants to bid for flight schedules with their airline. CompuServe offered customized products to other industries as well, including a service termed CompuServe for Lawyers; another was &quot;the African-American Culture and Arts Forum.&quot;

As part of CompuServe 2000, another customized portal made a two-year deal with WebMD.

=== CompuServe GUIs ===
Over time, there were several graphical user interfaces developed for accessing CompuServe. Unlike what AOL gave for free, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote about them &quot;which Compuserve ought to give away, but does not&quot;. Among their names were WinCIM, TapCIS and NavCIS.

At a time when subscribers paid for timed access (as well as long-distance calls in some countries) and had to spend time online reading and replying to messages, their goal was to bypass CompuServe&#x27;s WinCim interface, and streamline sending all pre-written email and forum postings that the user had written offline, then receiving new messages, downloading requested files, and logging off CompuServe.

==== TapCIS ====
TapCIS (The Access Program for the Compuserve Information Service) was an automated MS-DOS-based software application that sped up access to, and management of, CompuServe email accounts and forum memberships for PC users from 1981 until 2004 when advances in CompuServe technology rendered it obsolete. It was described as &quot;archaic-looking (but) .. remains a powerful tool for accessing CompuServe forums.&quot;

TapCIS was written in Borland&#x27;s Turbo Pascal code by Howard Benner, a marketing executive from Wilmington, Delaware, who joined CompuServe in 1981. The software, which was shareware and retailed at , had a community of users who continued to maintain their own website.

Since it was able to issue administrative commands, TapCIS was the preferred program for dozens of CompuServe system operators (sysops).

==== CIM and WinCIM ====
Regarding WinCIM (and predecessor CIM), &quot;PC Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;They give you a broader view of what&#x27;s available&quot; and by using it &quot;you can more easily navigate the service.&quot; They explicitly caution that, unlike TapCIS, it &quot;won&#x27;t save any money ... it could actually take you longer to retrieve and answer messages ... than without it.&quot;

==== OzCIS and OzWIN ====
Although OzCIS and OzWIN (its Windows-based successor) were described as &quot;free for personal use&quot; by &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, it was shareware, like WinCIM, TapCIS and NavCIS.

The programming was done by Steve Sneed using Pascal-like Delphi code; the software was published by Ozarks West Software Inc.

Like TapCIS, it had sysop features such as moving and deleting messages, administering the file libraries, and &quot;flagging&quot; users (giving and denying sysop rights). Unlike other offline readers such as TapCIS and NavCIS, which added proprietary ways of formatting text (colors, fonts, attributes), OzWin always remained &quot;plain text&quot; and never displayed any custom styles.

In May 2005, CompuServe discontinued access to the OzCis and TapCIS forums on CompuServe.

==== AutoSIG ====
AutoSIG was free, unlike WinCIM, TapCIS, NavCIS and OzCIS/OzWIN.

==== VisCIS ====
Visual CompuServe, also known as VisCIS, was a demonstration concept of a VRML-based client by programmer John D. Gwinner which modelled the CompuServe interface into a 3D virtual environment. It was later redeveloped by Gwinner into VisMenu, a general-purpose VRML menuing system.

=== Software applications ===
==== FILe Generator and Editor (FILGE) ====
FILe Generator and Editor (FILGE) was a command-oriented text editor created by CompuServe in the early 1970s. Later it was replaced by screen-oriented WYSIWYG editors. FILGE&#x27;s commands were preceded by a forward slash (/) character.

For example, if a text file contained the line &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,&quot; the word &#x27;fox&#x27; could be replaced with word &#x27;wolf&#x27; using the command:

codice_1

To see the result of the edit, the user could type:

codice_2

and in this case, would see &quot;The quick brown wolf jumps over the lazy dog&quot;

There were many other commands, including a repeating capability later, which allowed significant file manipulations without the need to write special programs.

==Market share==

Long the largest online service provider, by 1987 CompuServe had 380,000 subscribers, compared to 320,000 at the Dow Jones News/Retrieval, 80,000 at The Source, and 70,000 at GEnie.

CompuServe had three million users worldwide at its peak, compared to AOL&#x27;s 27 million. By early 1999, many home users had switched to standard dial-up Internet access, and CompuServe had decreased to two million users, most of which were business or professional users&quot;.

== Legal cases ==
In 1991, CompuServe was sued for defamation in one of the early cases testing the application of traditional law to the internet in &quot;Cubby v. CompuServe&quot;. Although defamatory content was posted on one of its forums, CompuServe was not liable for this content because it was unaware of the content and did not exercise editorial control of the forum.

A November 1993 copyright infringement lawsuit regarding about 900 songs was settled two years later, with payment to be divided among publishers of the songs.

In 1995, CompuServe blocked access to sex-oriented newsgroups after being pressured by Bavarian prosecutors. In 1997, after CompuServe reopened the newsfeeds, Felix Somm, the former managing director for CompuServe Germany, was charged with violating German child pornography laws because of the material CompuServe&#x27;s network was transmitting into Germany. He was first convicted in November 1997, and after another hearing sentenced to two years&#x27; probation on May 28, 1998. He was acquitted on appeal on November 17, 1999.

== WOW! service ==
 
Wow! (styled WOW!) was an unlimited-access flat-rate online service operated by CompuServe, starting March 1996; its closure was announced by November of the same year, to be effective at the end of January 1997.

Several class-action lawsuits were filed, claiming that WOW! was sold to stockholders with false and misleading information. Wow! was supposed to make the company competitive with AOL – &quot;a proprietary service aimed at families and novice computer users.&quot; The &quot;Wow! Information Service&quot;, announced in late 1995, was supposed to commence with Microsoft Windows 95 SR2, the first to include Internet Explorer. Knowing that bundling their browser would be considered anti-competitive, Microsoft also planned to bundle installers for several major ISPs into Windows, but CompuServe&#x27;s software was not ready.

=== Wow.com domain ===
AOL retained the domain name wow.com after it acquired CompuServe, and kept it dormant from the shut-down of Wow! until 2007. In mid-2007, AOL considered transferring its Digg-style news aggregator, then hosted at Netscape.com, to wow.com, before ultimately transferring it to Propeller.com. Toward the end of the year, AOL was reportedly working on using the domain for a social networking service concerning the popular online role-playing game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;.

From October 2010 until its 2015 shut-down, some of that was transferred to a subdomain of Joystiq. The domain wow.com was used simultaneously as a deal of the day site similar to Groupon. However, that site was also short-lived, shutting down in late 2011.

As of January 2019, wow.com is a search engine powered by Bing, using the same back-end as AOL Search, which is now part of Oath Inc.

== AOL acquisition and post–1997 history ==

The competition for customers between AOL and CompuServe became one of customers transferring back and forth, using free hours and other enticements. There were technical problems—the thousands of new generation U.S. Robotics dial-up modems deployed in the network would crash during high call volumes. For the first time in decades, CompuServe began losing money, and at a prodigious rate. An effort, code-named &quot;Red-Dog&quot;, was initiated to convert CompuServe&#x27;s long-time PDP-10 based technologies to servers based on Intel x86 architectures and the Microsoft operating system Windows NT.

Parent company H&amp;R Block was going through its own management changes at the same time, beginning with the retirement of CEO Henry Bloch. A series of successors ensued. In 1997, H&amp;R Block announced its intention to divest itself of CompuServe. A number of potential buyers came to the forefront, but the terms they offered were unacceptable to management. AOL, the most likely buyer, made several offers to purchase CompuServe using AOL stock, but H&amp;R Block management sought cash, or at least a better quality stock.

In February 1998, John W. Sidgmore, then vice chairman of WorldCom, and the former CEO of UUNET, devised a complex transaction which was ultimately satisfactory to all parties. Step one was that WorldCom purchased all the shares of CompuServe with $1.2 billion of WCOM stock. The next day, WorldCom sold the CompuServe Information Service portion of the company to AOL, retaining the CompuServe Network Services portion. AOL sold its networking division, Advanced Network Services (ANS), to WorldCom. Sidgmore said at this time that the world was in balance: the accountants were doing taxes, AOL was doing information services, and WorldCom was doing networks.

WorldCom&#x27;s newly acquired CompuServe Network Services was renamed WorldCom Advanced Networks, and continued to operate as a discrete company within WorldCom after being combined with AOL&#x27;s network subsidiary, ANS, and an existing WorldCom networking company named Gridnet. In 1999, Worldcom acquired MCI and became MCI WorldCom, WorldCom Advanced Networks briefly became MCI WorldCom Advanced Networks. MCI WorldCom Advanced Networks was ultimately absorbed into UUNET. Soon thereafter, WorldCom began its spiral to bankruptcy, re-emerging as MCI.

CompuServe was changed to the version &quot;CompuServe 7.0.&quot; in 2001. In September 2003 CompuServe Information Service, which had become a division of AOL, added CompuServe Basic to its product lines, selling via Netscape.com.

=== 2006–present ===
In 2006, MCI was sold to Verizon. As a result, the organization that had once been the networking business within CompuServe is now part of Verizon Business.

In January 2007, CompuServe e-mailed members that Windows Vista was not supported, and suggested switching to the AOL-branded service. Like many older programs, however, CompuServe client software can operate with Windows Vista in compatibility mode. 

While dividing CompuServe into its two major businesses, CompuServe Information Services and CompuServe Network Services, WorldCom and AOL both desired to make use of the CompuServe name and trademarks. Consequently, a jointly owned holding company was formed for no other purpose than to possess title to various trademarks, patents and other intellectual property, and to license that intellectual property at no cost to both WorldCom (now Verizon) and AOL.

CIS was then the value market-provider for several million customers, as part of the AOL Web Products Group. Recent U.S. versions of the CompuServe client software—essentially an enhanced Web browser—used the Gecko layout engine (developed for Mozilla) within a derivative of the AOL client and using the AOL dial-up network. The previous CompuServe service offering, re-branded as &quot;CompuServe Classic&quot;, remained available in the US and also in other countries where CompuServe 2000 was not offered.

CompuServe announced on April 15, 2009, that CompuServe Classic would &quot;no longer operate as an Internet Service Provider&quot; and would terminate on June 30, 2009. All CompuServe Classic services, including OurWorld Web pages, were taken offline as of that date. CompuServe Classic e-mail users would be able to continue using their CompuServe e-mail addresses via a new e-mail system.

In 2015, when Verizon acquired AOL, all of CompuServe&#x27;s original properties became parts of Verizon.

CompuServe announced in November 2017 that the CompuServe Forums would be closed on December 15, 2017.

AOL used the CompuServe brand for CompuServe 2000 (a rebranded low-cost offering), which ended in 2011 (including Mac), and CompuServe Dialer (a low-cost dial-up ISP that became a Web portal).

, Compuserve.com serves a rebranded version of the Netscape Internet Service Web portal.

==International operations==
Before the widespread use of the Internet and World Wide Web, the United Kingdom&#x27;s first national major-brands online shopping service was developed by the UK subsidiary of CompuServe/CIS as part of its proprietary closed-system collection of consumer services. Andrew Gray initiated CompuServe UK&#x27;s operations as the European subsidiary of the US company during the late 1980s and later became the company&#x27;s European general manager, while David Gilroy was CompuServe&#x27;s UK director of customer services. The service continued to grow and offered technical assistance managed by Suzanne Gautier and sales managed by Colin Campbell.

The service was proposed by Paul Stanfield, an independent business-to-consumer electronic commerce consultant, to Martin Turner, Product Marketing Director for CIS UK, in August 1994. Turner agreed and the project started in September with rapid market research, product development and sales of online space to major UK retail and catalogue companies. These included WH Smith, Tesco, Virgin/Our Price, Great Universal Stores/GUS, Interflora, Dixons Retail, Past Times, PC World (retailer) and Innovations.

The service began on Thursday April 27, 1995, with Paul Stanfield&#x27;s purchase of a book from the WH Smith shop. This was a repeat of the first formal test of the service on February 9, 1995, which included secure payment and subsequent fulfilment of the order by Royal Mail postal delivery. Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG), the UK&#x27;s industry association for e-retailing, believes that the UK&#x27;s first national shopping service secure online transaction was the purchase of a WH Smith book from the CompuServe facility.

Approximately 1,000,000 UK customers had access to the shops at that time and it was British retailers&#x27; first major exposure to the medium. Other retailers joined the service soon after and included Sainsbury&#x27;s Wine and Jaguar Cars (branded lifestyle goods). CompuServe UK commissioned writer Sue Schofield to produce a &#x27;retail&#x27; pack including a new &quot;UK CompuServe Book&quot; and a free CD-ROM containing the CIS software to access the service.

CompuServe, with its closed private network system, was slow to react to the rapid development of the open World Wide Web and it was not long before major UK retailers started to develop their own websites independently of CompuServe.

In Germany, CompuServe 2000 was introduced in 1999 and withdrawn in 2001 because of market failure, but CompuServe Classic service remained for a while. CompuServe Germany introduced its own products for dial-up and DSL internet access, and its own client software (termed &quot;CompuServe 4.5 light&quot;).

In July 2007, CompuServe Pacific announced cessation as of August 31, 2007. In September 2007, it was announced that CompuServe France would end its operations on November 30, 2007. In the Pacific region (Australia, New Zealand, etc.) Fujitsu Australia operated the CompuServe Pacific franchise. In July 2008, CompuServe Germany informed its customers that it would end its operations on July 31, 2008. Its legacy service &quot;CompuServe Classic&quot; would not be affected by this decision.

<text>The More the Merrier is a 1943 American romantic comedy film produced and directed by George Stevens, and starring Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea, and Charles Coburn. The film&#x27;s script—from &quot;Two&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, an original screenplay by Garson Kanin (uncredited)—was written by Robert Russell, Frank Ross, Richard Flournoy, and Lewis R. Foster. Set in Washington, D.C., the film presents a comic look at the housing shortage during World War II.

The film received six nominations at the 16th Academy Awards, among them Best Picture, Best Director for Stevens, Best Actress for Arthur, Best Writing (Original Motion Picture Story), and Best Writing (Screenplay). Coburn won Best Supporting Actor.

The film was remade in 1966 as &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; starring Cary Grant, Samantha Eggar, and Jim Hutton. The setting was changed to Tokyo, which had experienced housing shortages due to the 1964 Summer Olympics.

==Plot==
Retired millionaire Benjamin Dingle arrives in Washington, D.C., as an adviser on the housing shortage, and finds that his hotel suite will not be available for two days. He sees a classified ad for a roommate and talks the reluctant young woman, Connie Milligan, into letting him sublet half of her apartment. The next morning, after Connie leaves for work, Dingle meets Sergeant Joe Carter, who is interested in a room to stay for a week while waiting to be shipped overseas. Recognizing Joe as a suitable young man for Connie, Dingle rents him half of his half.

When Connie discovers the new arrangement, she angrily orders both men to leave, but is forced to relent because she has already spent the pair&#x27;s rent. Joe and Connie soon develop a mutual attraction, though she is engaged to pompous bureaucrat Charles J. Pendergast. Connie&#x27;s mother married for love, not security, and Connie is determined not to repeat that mistake. Dingle meets Pendergast by chance at a business luncheon the following day and decides that Joe would be a better match for Connie.

One day, Dingle reads aloud to Joe from Connie&#x27;s diary, including her thoughts about Joe. Dingle is caught by Connie, who demands they both leave the next day. Dingle takes full blame for the incident, and retreats to his now-available hotel room. Joe gives Connie a traveling bag as an apology gift, and she allows him to stay until he departs for Africa in two days.

Joe asks Connie out to dinner that night; she is initially reluctant but decides she will accept his invitation if Pendergast does not call her by 8:00. At 8:00, Joe and Connie prepare to leave, but her nosy teenage neighbor seeks her advice and delays her until Pendergast arrives downstairs. As Connie and Pendergast leave together, Joe spies on the couple from his window with binoculars. When the neighbor asks what he is doing, Joe flippantly tells him he is a Japanese spy.

Dingle calls Joe to meet him for dinner at a restaurant, where they run into Connie and Pendergast. Playing Cupid, Dingle invites Pendergast to his suite to discuss the housing shortage, so that Joe and Connie can be alone together. Later, Joe walks Connie home. The two share their romantic pasts and end up kissing on the front steps. Inside, a sleepless Joe confesses through his bedroom wall that he loves her. She tells him she feels the same way, but refuses to marry him, as they will soon be forced apart when he leaves for Africa.

Joe and Connie are interrupted by the arrival of two brusque FBI agents, who have been tipped off that Joe is a Japanese spy. Joe and Connie are taken to FBI headquarters. They assert that Dingle can vouch for Joe&#x27;s identity and innocence. Dingle arrives, bringing Pendergast. During questioning, Pendergast is shocked to learn that Joe and Connie share the same address. When they ask Dingle to tell Pendergast that their living arrangement is purely innocent, he denies knowing them.

Outside the station, Dingle says he lied to protect his reputation. Taking a taxi home, they all discuss what to do to avoid a scandal. Connie grows angry when Pendergast only cares about his career and returns his ring. When another passenger in the shared cab turns out to be a reporter, Pendergast runs after him to try to stop him from writing about his fiancée cohabiting with Joe.

Dingle assures Connie that if she marries Joe, the crisis will be averted, and they can file for a quick annulment afterwards. With 26 hours until Joe leaves for Africa, they follow his advice and fly to South Carolina to wed, where a license can be more quickly obtained than in D.C. Returning home, Connie allows Joe to spend his final night in her apartment. As Dingle had foreseen, Connie&#x27;s attraction to Joe may yet overcome her misgivings; this is facilitated by Dingle having conscripted a group of men living downstairs to remove the wall between their two bedrooms. Outside, Dingle changes the nameplate on the apartment door to read &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Sgt. Carter&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
Jean Arthur got the ball rolling on &quot;The More The Merrier&quot;, paying playwright and writer Garson Kanin $25,000 to adapt his short story &quot;Two&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; into a screenplay. She hoped to take the role of Connie and serve out her contract with Columbia Studios, which had become irksome due to her deteriorating relationship with studio boss Harry Cohn. Kanin co-wrote the script with Robert Russell and Frank Ross, Arthur&#x27;s husband. Arthur also brought director George Stevens (with whom she had recently worked on 1942&#x27;s &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot;) and co-star Joel McCrea to the project.

Principal photography took place between September 11 and December 19, 1942, with additional &quot;inserts&quot; filmed in late January 1943.

Stevens, known as a perfectionist, filmed many takes of each scene and shot from multiple angles. McCrea recalled that studio boss Cohn approached him during production, saying, &quot;What&#x27;s that son of a bitch Stevens doing, making all that film? He used more exposed film in one picture than in any five pictures I&#x27;ve ever made.&quot;

Stevens was working under a three-film contract at Columbia Studios, and completed the terms of his contract with &quot;The More the Merrier&quot;. He had previously shot two Cary Grant vehicles at Columbia—the melodrama &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; (1941) and the comedy-drama &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; (1942). Less than a month after finishing work on &quot;The More the Merrier&quot;, he traveled to North Africa with the Army&#x27;s combat photography unit. &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; was Stevens&#x27; last comedy, as he turned to drama and Westerns after the war.

In early drafts, &quot;The More The Merrier&quot; was titled &quot;Two&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;. Other titles considered included &quot;Washington Story&quot;; &quot;Full Steam Ahead&quot;; &quot;Come One, Come All&quot;; and &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;, which actually tested best with audiences. Washington officials, though, objected to a title and plot elements that suggested &quot;frivolity on the part of Washington workers&quot;. &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; was finally approved as the title.

McCrea was exhausted after already shooting three films in 1942, and signed on to &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; only at Arthur&#x27;s request. The pair had a working relationship dating back more than a decade, having met on precode romantic melodrama &quot;The Silver Horde&quot; (1930). McCrea was initially suspicious that the studio was willing to cast him as Joe Carter, feeling that if it were a good part, they would have pursued Grant or Gary Cooper, but the role later became his own favorite of his comic performances.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Contemporary reviews were broadly positive. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; enjoyed &quot;The More the Merrier&quot;, calling the film &quot;as warm and refreshing a ray of sunshine as we&#x27;ve had in a very late Spring&quot;. He praised all three leads, the writers, and the director, singling out Coburn as &quot;the comical crux of the film&quot; who &quot;handles the job in fine fettle&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a sparkling and effervescing piece of entertainment&quot;.

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;Excellent entertainment! George Stevens&#x27; masterful direction, and the fine acting of Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea, and Charles Coburn make this one of the brightest and gayest comedies to have come out of Hollywood in many a season.&quot;

David Lardner of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;As is the case with a lot of madcap comedies, this one tends to fall apart somewhat toward the end, when all the accumulated mixups are supposed to be resolved without a complete sacrifice of logic, but by no means are. As long as these mixups are purely being established, however, and nobody&#x27;s worrying about clearing them up, everything is fine.&quot;

&quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; noted, &quot;Despite a belated drift towards sentimentality, this remains a refreshingly intimate movie.&quot;

TV Guide characterized the film as &quot;[a] delightful and effervescent comedy marked with terrific performances&quot; and praises Coburn as &quot;nothing short of superb, stealing scene after scene with astonishing ease&quot;.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 19 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10.

<text>The University of Stirling (, (abbreviated as Stir or Shruiglea, in post-nominals)) is a public university in Stirling, Scotland, founded by a royal charter in 1967. It is located in the Central Belt of Scotland, built within the walled Airthrey Castle estate. 

The university campus is approximately in size, incorporating the Stirling University Innovation Park and the Dementia Centre. The campus is located in the foothills of the Ochil Hills. In 2002, the University of Stirling and the landscape of the Airthrey Estate was designated by the International Council on Monuments and Sites as one of the UK&#x27;s top 20 heritage sites of the 20th century. 

As of 2022, the university has 14,000 part-time and full-time students. Stirling has international degree programme partnerships in China with Hebei Normal University, Singapore with Singapore Institute of Management, and Oman. The university offers a MSc in Human Rights &amp; Diplomacy, which is the only Human Rights and Diplomacy programme in the world taught in partnership with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research.

==History==
Stirling was the first new university to be established in Scotland for nearly 400 years. The original site of the campus was selected from shortlisted competing sites, which include Falkirk, Perth and Inverness. The author of the Robbins Review, which recommended an expansion of the number of universities in the UK during the 1960s, Lord Robbins, was appointed as the university&#x27;s first chancellor in 1968. In 1967 a house for the university principal Tom Cottrell was completed, designed by architects Morris and Steedman. It was listed as category A in 2009.
The Pathfoot Building, which represented the first phase of development on the campus, was completed in 1968 and originally housed lecture theatres, offices and classrooms in addition to the &#x27;crush hall&#x27; where the university displayed its emerging collection of contemporary Scottish art. The building was extended in 1979 to include a Tropical Aquarium and again in 1987 to include a Virology Unit associated with the university&#x27;s Institute of Aquaculture. In 1993, the Pathfoot Building was selected by the international conservation organisation DoCoMoMo as one of sixty key Scottish monuments of the post-war era. It was also voted as one of Prospect&#x27;s 100 best modern Scottish buildings. In 1970, development began on what was subsequently named the Cottrell Building, in memory of the university&#x27;s first principal Cottrell. It comprises two parallel buildings with cross link corridors and interspersed courtyard gardens. The building today houses most of the university administration, lecture theatres, departmental offices, classrooms and computer laboratories. The University Library, Atrium and MacRobert Centre are housed in an adjoining building, the Andrew Miller Building, which was completed in 1971.

On 13 October 1972, during a visit to the new campus by HM The Queen, she was subjected to a rowdy reception by booing students, widely reported in the media. The students were protesting about the lack of social spaces in what was at the time a relatively newly built university. On the 14 October 1972 the University Court ordered an immediate investigation into the students’ behaviour. Twenty-four students allegedly involved were charged for the disruption. Jackie McKie was cleared on 15 December 1972. On February 12 1973 students boycotted the ensuing disciplinary trials. When Linda Quinn, the President of the Council of Students’ Association, appealed against her conviction in early March 1973, students organised a mass demonstration to mark the event. Eventually all charges were dropped. Linda Quinn completed her studies at Stirling. There were no further Royal visits until 2011, when Prince Edward formally opened the refurbished library.

A department of Business studies was set up in 1982. The Institute of Aquaculture, a research institute specialising in fish farming and genetics, opened the same year. In 1983 it sold 300 acres of land to Wang Laboratories. The R.G. Bomont Building (named after the second University Secretary), which houses the Faculty of Social Science, was completed in 1998. The Iris Murdoch building was opened in 2002 to house The Dementia Services Development Centre, and the Colin Bell Building was completed in 2003.

== Campus ==

The university campus is set within of grounds beneath the Ochil Hills, from the centre of Stirling, close to the town of Bridge of Allan. It is regularly described as one of the most beautiful campuses in the world and was ranked 1st in the UK for its campus environment in the International Student Barometer 2016. It is situated on the site of the historic Airthrey estate which includes the Robert Adam-designed 18th-century Airthrey Castle and includes the Hermitage woods, Airthrey Loch, Airthrey Golf Course. The Andrew Miller Building incorporates an Atrium, which contains several retail and food outlets including a bookstore, bank and general store. This building links the Library and Robbins&#x27; Centre Students&#x27; Union and has connecting bridges to the Cottrell Building, on-campus student residences and the MacRobert Arts Centre. The Library holds over 500,000 volumes and over 9,000 journals. Home to the archives of both the novelist Patrick McGrath and filmmaker Norman McLaren, the Library reopened in August 2010 after a major refurbishment programme. MacRobert Arts Centre is a small theatre and cinema complex open to members of the university community and the general public. The university houses a considerable fine art collection in the Pathfoot Building, comprising over 300 works including paintings, tapestries and sculpture.

The university previously maintained campuses in Inverness and Stornoway, which specialised in Nursing and Midwifery. The Highland site was on the outskirts of Inverness within the grounds of Raigmore Hospital. The Western Isles campus was located in Stornoway and the teaching accommodation was part of the Western Isles Hospital. In 2016, it was announced that the University of Stirling would be transferring delivery of its programmes on these campuses to the University of the Highlands and Islands.

===Accommodation===

The University of Stirling student accommodation can cater for almost 3,000 students in over 20 properties located on and off campus. Most accommodation is in university halls and located on campus. There are town houses at Alexander Court for families and groups of students. Of the 2,000 rooms located on-campus, 800 were built since 2013 as part of a £40m investment programme in student accommodation which was completed in September 2015.

Halls of Residence located on campus include: 
* Andrew Stewart Hall

===Sport facilities===

Stirling was designated as Scotland&#x27;s University for Sporting Excellence by the Scottish Government in 2008. Scholarships are available in five core sports: football, golf, swimming, tennis and triathlon, which allow student athletes to prepare for international competition.

The university has a comprehensive range of sports facilities including a 9-hole Airthrey Golf Course and a 50-metre swimming pool completed in 2001 as part of the National Swimming Academy – a partnership between the university, Scottish Swimming and British Swimming. The sports centre also holds the Gannochy National Tennis Centre, badminton and squash courts, a fitness centre, strength and conditioning centre, sports halls and all-weather playing fields available for students, university staff and the public. The campus is the headquarters for a number of sports agencies including the sportscotland institute of sport, Commonwealth Games Scotland, Scottish Swimming and triathlonscotland.

At Rio 2016, a number of students and alumni from the university competed for Great Britain. Swimmers included Duncan Scott and Robbie Renwick, who both earned silver medals, as well as Commonwealth gold medalist Ross Murdoch.

Top seed tennis player Andy Murray and his brother Jamie Murray trained on the university courts when they were young. Gordon Reid, wheelchair Olympic gold medalist in 2016, was a tennis scholar at the university. The university men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf teams are consistently ranked among the best in Europe.

The university&#x27;s most senior football teams compete in the main Scottish league pyramid; the men&#x27;s team in the regional fifth tier, and the women&#x27;s team in the second tier. Lower teams compete in the BUCS Football Leagues. In January 2023, the men&#x27;s football team made history by reaching the 4th round of the Scottish Cup. Losing 1-0 away to Dundee United.

In 2018, the university announced a £20 million transformation of its sports facilities. The project included construction of a new sports centre, which opened in November 2020. The university&#x27;s new sports centre includes a fitness suite with more than 100 stations, wireless connectivity, three Outrace functional rigs across the new spaces, and new public strength and conditioning area.

==Academic profile==

===Teaching===
Most Scottish degree programmes are designed to include four years of study with the intention of providing a broad and flexible education. Stirling has offered four-year, modular degree programmes since the university was first founded. In the 1960s and 1970s Credit Accumulation and Transfer Schemes, which create flexible pathways for students to acquire qualifications, were predominantly used in the US with the UK system operating on a disciplinary progression model. Initially, Stirling&#x27;s modular approach, and its inherent flexibility, was seen as novel in the UK, but through time, more institutions moved to a semester basis and today almost all universities operate in this way.

Teaching at Stirling is delivered on a two-semester basis with the academic year beginning in mid-September and the first semester ending in mid-December. The second semester runs from the beginning of January to the end of May each year. At undergraduate level, three modules are taken in the first semester and three in the second. The basic module of study at Stirling is assigned 20 Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) credit points. Ordinary degrees have a minimum credit total of 360 points.

The university offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses covering the liberal arts, natural science, management school and health science. Stirling achieved a 5 Star Excellence Award for Teaching by QS Stars in 2016.

===Research===
Stirling is an interdisciplinary research-intensive University with a range of research activity focused on Health and Wellbeing; Culture and Society; Environment; Enterprise and the Economy; and Sport. The Research Excellence Framework also rated almost three-quarters of research activity either world-leading or internationally excellent.

=== Business links ===

The university has major industrial research links through Stirling University Innovation Park. This large science park was founded in 1993 and is located adjacent to the main university campus. It is home to around 50 companies engaging in various forms of research and development. During the 1990s the university built a stand-alone Management Centre on the campus. This developed over time into a Conference Centre with residential accommodation. In 2015, the Management Centre was rebranded the Stirling Court Hotel.

==Student life==

=== Students&#x27; Union ===
The University of Stirling Students&#x27; Union is based in the university&#x27;s Robbins Centre Students&#x27; Union on campus and is affiliated to the National Union of Students. The union provides students with entertainment, welfare and information services and represents students interests to a range of organisations, including the university. Senior members of the union are entitled to seats on the University Court. The union supports more than 90 clubs and societies. The Sports Union supports 53 sports clubs. The university has student-run media services. &quot;Brig&quot; has been the campus newspaper since 1969. &quot;Air3 Radio&quot; was the first campus radio station in Scotland (previously URA – University Radio Airthrey), and &quot;AirTV&quot; (formerly Videoworks) is a television station for students, set up in 2002.

The Students&#x27; Union is governed by a board of trustees as well as a Chief Executive. The four sabbatical officers of the SU are the Union President, Sports President, Vice-President Education and Vice-President Communities. Alongside these full-time, paid officers are numerous part-time volunteer executive officers.

On 14 November 2022, the student union voted to transition to 100% plant-based catering and all vegan meals within three years. The student union&#x27;s three cafes will serve menus that are half vegan in 2023–2024 academic year and be fully vegan by 2025. The transition was initiated by the student chapter of Plant-Based Universities. Animal-based agricultural groups on campus criticised the move and student activists faced personal abuse at their homes.

<text>The Richmond–Petersburg campaign was a series of battles around Petersburg, Virginia, fought from June 9, 1864, to March 25, 1865, during the American Civil War. Although it is more popularly known as the siege of Petersburg, it was not a classic military siege, in which a city is encircled with fortifications blocking all routes of ingress and egress, nor was it strictly limited to actions against Petersburg. The campaign consisted of nine months of trench warfare in which Union forces commanded by Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant assaulted Petersburg unsuccessfully and then constructed trench lines that eventually extended over from the eastern outskirts of Richmond, Virginia, to around the eastern and southern outskirts of Petersburg. Petersburg was crucial to the supply of Confederate General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army and the Confederate capital of Richmond. Numerous raids were conducted and battles fought in attempts to cut off the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad. Many of these battles caused the lengthening of the trench lines.

Lee finally gave in to the pressure and abandoned both cities in April 1865, leading to his retreat and surrender at Appomattox Court House. The siege of Petersburg foreshadowed the trench warfare that would be seen fifty years later in World War I, earning it a prominent position in military history. It also featured the war&#x27;s largest concentration of African-American troops, who suffered heavy casualties at such engagements as the Battle of the Crater and Chaffin&#x27;s Farm.

==Background==

===Military situation===

In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant was promoted to lieutenant general and was given command of the Union Army. He devised a coordinated strategy to apply pressure on the Confederacy from many points, something President Abraham Lincoln had urged his generals to do from the beginning of the war. Grant put Major General William T. Sherman in immediate command of all forces in the West and moved his own headquarters to be with the Army of the Potomac (still commanded by Major General George G. Meade) in Virginia, where he intended to maneuver Lee&#x27;s army to a decisive battle; his secondary objective was to capture Richmond (the capital of the Confederacy), but Grant knew that the latter would happen automatically once the former was accomplished. His coordinated strategy called for Grant and Meade to attack Lee from the north, while Major General Benjamin Butler drove toward Richmond from the southeast; Major General Franz Sigel to control the Shenandoah Valley; Sherman to invade Georgia, defeat General Joseph E. Johnston, and capture Atlanta; Brig. Gens. George Crook and William W. Averell to operate against railroad supply lines in West Virginia; and Major General Nathaniel P. Banks to capture Mobile, Alabama.

Most of these initiatives failed, often because of the assignment of generals to Grant for political rather than military reasons. Butler&#x27;s Army of the James bogged down against inferior forces under General P.G.T. Beauregard before Richmond in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign. Sigel was soundly defeated at the Battle of New Market in May and soon afterward he was replaced by Major General David Hunter. Banks was distracted by the Red River Campaign and failed to move on to Mobile, Alabama. However, Crook and Averell were able to cut the last railway linking Virginia and Tennessee, and Sherman&#x27;s Atlanta Campaign was a success, although it dragged on through the fall.

On May 4, Grant and Meade&#x27;s Army of the Potomac crossed the Rapidan River and entered the area known as the Wilderness of Spotsylvania, beginning the six-week Overland Campaign. At the bloody but tactically inconclusive Battle of the Wilderness (May 5–7) and Battle of Spotsylvania Court House (May 8–21), Grant failed to destroy Lee&#x27;s army but, unlike his predecessors, did not retreat after the battles; he repeatedly moved his army leftward to the southeast in a campaign that kept Lee on the defensive and moved ever closer to Richmond. Grant spent the remainder of May maneuvering and fighting minor battles with the Confederate army as he attempted to turn Lee&#x27;s flank and lure him into the open. Grant knew that his larger army and base of manpower in the North could sustain a war of attrition better than Lee and the Confederacy could. This theory was tested at the Battle of Cold Harbor (May 31 – June 12) when Grant&#x27;s army once again came into contact with Lee&#x27;s near Mechanicsville. He chose to engage Lee&#x27;s army directly, by ordering a frontal assault on the Confederate fortified positions on June 3. This attack was repulsed with heavy losses. Cold Harbor was a battle that Grant regretted more than any other and Northern newspapers thereafter frequently referred to him as a &quot;butcher&quot;. Although Grant suffered high losses during the campaign—approximately 50,000 casualties, or 41%—Lee lost even higher percentages of his men—approximately 32,000, or 46%—losses that could not be replaced.

On the night of June 12, Grant again advanced by his left flank, marching to the James River. He planned to cross to the south bank of the river, bypassing Richmond, and isolate Richmond by seizing the railroad junction of Petersburg to the south. While Lee remained unaware of Grant&#x27;s intentions, the Union army constructed a pontoon bridge 2,100 feet (640 m) long and crossed the James River on June 14–18. What Lee had feared most of all—that Grant would force him into a siege of Richmond—was poised to occur. Petersburg, a prosperous city of 18,000, was a supply center for Richmond, given its strategic location just south of Richmond, its site on the Appomattox River that provided navigable access to the James River, and its role as a major crossroads and junction for five railroads. Since Petersburg was the main supply base and rail depot for the entire region, including Richmond, the taking of Petersburg by Union forces would make it impossible for Lee to continue defending Richmond (the Confederate capital). This represented a change of strategy from that of the preceding Overland Campaign, in which confronting and defeating Lee&#x27;s army in the open was the primary goal. Now, Grant selected a geographic and political target and knew that his superior resources could besiege Lee there, pin him down, and either starve him into submission or lure him out for a decisive battle. Lee at first believed that Grant&#x27;s main target was Richmond and devoted only minimal troops under Beauregard to the defense of Petersburg.

==Opposing forces==

===Union===

At the beginning of the campaign, Grant&#x27;s Union forces consisted of the Army of the Potomac, under Meade, and the Army of the James, under Butler.

The Army of the Potomac included:
*II Corps, under Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, including the divisions of Maj. Gens. David B. Birney and John Gibbon and Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow.
*V Corps, under Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, including the divisions of Brig. Gens. Charles Griffin, Romeyn B. Ayres, Samuel W. Crawford, and Lysander Cutler.
*VI Corps, under Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright, including the divisions of Brig. Gens. David A. Russell, Thomas H. Neill, and Truman Seymour. (The VI Corps was on detached service in the Shenandoah Valley from mid-July to early December 1864.)
*IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, including the divisions of Brig. Gens. James H. Ledlie, Robert B. Potter, Orlando B. Willcox, and Edward Ferrero (the latter division being manned by United States Colored Troops [USCTs]). Maj. Gen. John G. Parke replaced Burnside after the Battle of the Crater.
*Cavalry Corps, under Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan, including the divisions of Brig. Gens. Alfred T.A. Torbert, David McM. Gregg, and James H. Wilson. Sheridan and much of his command were on detached service in the Shenandoah Valley from mid-July 1864 to late March 1865. Upon their return, Sheridan often referred to his Cavalry Corps as the Army of the Shenandoah, reflecting their role in the Valley Campaigns of 1864.

The Army of the James included:
*X Corps, under Maj. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore (initially - June 15, 1864), Maj. Gen David B. Birney (from July 23, 1864 – October 10, 1864) and Brig. Gen. Alfred H. Terry, including the divisions of Brig. Gens. Robert S. Foster and Adelbert Ames.
*XVIII Corps, under Maj. Gen. William F. &quot;Baldy&quot; Smith, including the divisions of Brig. Gens. William T. H. Brooks, John H. Martindale, and Edward W. Hinks (the latter also a USCT division).
*XXIV Corps, under Maj. Gen. Edward O.C. Ord, including the divisions of Brig. Gen. Robert S. Foster, Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Harris, and Brig. Gen. Charles Devens.
*XXV Corps, under Maj. Gen. Godfrey Weitzel, including the divisions of Brig. Gens. Charles J. Paine, William Birney, and Edward A. Wild.
*Cavalry Division, under Brig. Gen. August Kautz.

On December 3, 1864, the racially integrated X Corps and XVIII Corps were reorganized to become the all-white XXIV Corps and the all-black (officers excepted) XXV Corps.

Grant made his headquarters in a cabin on the lawn of Appomattox Manor, the home of Richard Eppes and the oldest home (built in 1763) in what was then City Point, but is now Hopewell, Virginia.

===Confederate===

Lee&#x27;s Confederate force consisted of his own Army of Northern Virginia, as well as a scattered, disorganized group of 10,000 men defending Richmond under Beauregard. Many of the men under Beauregard&#x27;s command consisted of soldiers who were either too young or too old to fight in the Army of Northern Virginia, or men who had been discharged from Lee&#x27;s army due to wounds that rendered them unfit for service. The Army of Northern Virginia was initially organized into four corps:
*First Corps, under Lt. Gen. Richard H. Anderson, including the divisions of Maj. Gens. George E. Pickett, Charles W. Field, and Joseph B. Kershaw. Lt. Gen. James Longstreet returned from medical leave and resumed command of the corps on October 19. Anderson was given command of the new Fourth Corps, which included the division of Maj. Gen. Bushrod R. Johnson.
*Second Corps, under Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early, was detached on June 12 for operations in the Shenandoah Valley and played no direct role in the defense of Petersburg.
*Third Corps, under Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill, including the divisions of Maj. Gens. Henry Heth and Cadmus M. Wilcox and Brig. Gen. William Mahone.
*Cavalry Corps, under Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton, including the divisions of Maj. Gens. Fitzhugh Lee and W.H.F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee.

Beauregard&#x27;s Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia had four depleted divisions commanded by major generals Robert Ransom Jr., Robert F. Hoke William H. C. Whiting, and Brigadier General Alfred H. Colquitt. (Later in the campaign, Beauregard&#x27;s department was expanded and reorganized to consist of the divisions of major generals Hoke and Bushrod Johnson).

===Comparison between Union and Confederate armies===

Grant&#x27;s armies were significantly larger than Lee&#x27;s during the campaign, although the strengths varied. During the initial assaults on the city, 15,000 Federal troops faced about 5,400 men under Beauregard. By June 18, the Federal strength exceeded 67,000 against the Confederate 20,000. More typical of the full campaign was in mid-July, when 70,000 Union troops faced 36,000 Confederates around Petersburg, and 40,000 men under Butler faced 21,000 around Richmond. The Union Army, despite suffering horrific losses during the Overland Campaign, was able to replenish its soldiers and equipment, taking advantage of garrison troops from Washington, D.C., and the increasing availability of African-American soldiers. By the end of the siege, Grant had 125,000 men to begin the Appomattox campaign. The Confederate army, in contrast, had difficulty replacing men lost through battle, disease, and desertion. As a result of this severe lack of manpower facing the Confederates, when Beauregard&#x27;s men occupied the trenches around the city, there were gaps in the line of up to between men.

==Role of African Americans==

At the siege of Petersburg in June 1864, enslaved African Americans worked on digging trenches and other manual labor on behalf of the Confederacy, while African Americans fought in the Union Army of the Potomac as soldiers of the United States Colored Troops.

===In Petersburg===
At the beginning of the American Civil War, Virginia had a black population of about 549,000. This meant that of the Confederacy&#x27;s total black population, one in six blacks lived in Virginia. Of those African Americans in Virginia 89% were slaves. In Petersburg about half the population was black of which nearly 35% were free. Petersburg was considered to have the largest number of free blacks of any Southern city at that time. Many of the freedmen prospered there as barbers, blacksmiths, boatmen, draymen, livery stable keepers, and caterers.

===Serving the Confederacy===
When Petersburg became a major supply center for the newly formed Confederacy and its nearby capital in Richmond, both freedmen and slaves were employed in various war functions, one of which was working for the numerous railroad companies that operated in and out of the city. In 1862 Captain Charles Dimmock used freedmen and slave labor to construct a ten-mile long defensive line of trenches and batteries around the city.

Once the siege began in June, African Americans continued working for the Confederacy. In September, Lee asked for an additional 2,000 blacks to be added to his labor force. On January 11, 1865, Lee wrote the Confederate Congress urging them to pass pending legislation to arm and enlist black slaves in exchange for their freedom. On March 13, the Confederate Congress passed legislation to raise and enlist companies of black soldiers. The legislation was then promulgated into military policy by Davis in General Order No. 14 on March 23. The emancipation offered, however, was still reliant upon one&#x27;s master agreement; &quot;no slave will be accepted as a recruit unless with his own consent and with the approbation of his master by a written instrument conferring, as far as he may, the rights of a freedman&quot;.

===Serving the Union===
During the war a total of nearly 187,000 African Americans served in the Union Army. Of those the greatest concentration of U.S. Colored Troops was at Petersburg. In the initial assault upon the city on June 15, a division of USCTs in the XVIII Corps helped capture and secure a section of the Dimmock line. The other division at Petersburg was with the IX Corps and it fought in the Battle of the Crater, July 30.

In December, all the USCTs around Petersburg were incorporated into three divisions and became the XXV Corps of the Army of the James. It was the largest black force assembled during the war and varied between 9,000 and 16,000 men. Overall in the Petersburg Campaign USCTs would participate in 6 major engagements and earn 15 of the 25 total Medals of Honor that were awarded to African American soldiers in the Civil War.

===At City Point===
African Americans served in varying capacities at the Union supply base at City Point. They served as pickets, railroad workers, and laborers &quot;discharging the ships, wheeling the dirt, sawing the timber and driving the piles.&quot; Many also worked at the Depot Field Hospital as cooks.

==Initial attempts to capture Petersburg==

===Butler&#x27;s assault (June 9)===

While Lee and Grant faced each other after Cold Harbor, Benjamin Butler became aware that Confederate troops had been moving north to reinforce Lee, leaving the defenses of Petersburg in a vulnerable state. Sensitive to his failure in the Bermuda Hundred campaign, Butler sought to achieve a success to vindicate his generalship. He wrote, &quot;the capture of Petersburg lay near my heart.&quot;

Petersburg was protected by multiple lines of fortifications, the outermost of which was known as the Dimmock line, a line of earthworks and trenches long, with 55 redoubts, east of the city. The 2,500 Confederates stretched thin along this defensive line were commanded by a former Virginia governor, Brigadier General Henry A. Wise. Despite the number of fortifications, because of a series of hills and valleys around the outskirts of Petersburg there were several places along the outer defenses where cavalry could easily ride through undetected until they reached the inner defenses of the city.

Butler&#x27;s plan was formulated on the afternoon of June 8, calling for three columns to cross the Appomattox and advance with 4,500 men. The first and second consisted of infantry from Gillmore&#x27;s X Corps and USCTs from Hinks&#x27;s 3rd Division of XVIII Corps, which was to attack the Dimmock line east of the city. The third was 1,300 cavalrymen under Kautz, who were to sweep around Petersburg and strike it from the southeast. The troops moved out on the night of June 8, but made poor progress. Eventually the infantry crossed by 3:40 a.m. on June 9 and by 7 a.m., both Gillmore and Hinks had encountered the enemy, but stopped at their fronts. Gillmore told Hinks that he would attack but that both of the infantry columns should await the cavalry assault from the south.

Kautz&#x27;s men did not arrive until noon, however, having been delayed en route by numerous enemy pickets. They assaulted the Dimmock line where it crossed the Jerusalem Plank Road (present-day U.S. Route 301, Crater Road). The Confederates&#x27; Battery 27, also known as Rives&#x27;s Salient, was manned by 150 militiamen commanded by Major Fletcher H. Archer. Kautz first launched a probing attack, then paused. His main attack was by the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry against the home guard, a group consisting primarily of teenagers, elderly men, and some wounded soldiers from city hospitals. The home guards retreated to the city with heavy losses, but by this time Beauregard had been able to bring reinforcements from Richmond to bear, which were able to repulse the Union assault. Kautz, hearing no activity on Gillmore&#x27;s front, presumed that he was left on his own and withdrew. Confederate casualties were about 80, Union 40. Butler was furious with Gillmore&#x27;s timidity and incompetence and arrested him. Gillmore requested a court of inquiry, which was never convened, but Grant later reassigned him and the incident was dropped.

===Meade&#x27;s assaults (June 15–18, 1864)===

Grant selected Butler&#x27;s Army of the James, which had performed poorly in the Bermuda Hundred campaign, to lead the expedition toward Petersburg. On June 14 he directed Butler to augment the XVIII Corps, commanded by Smith, to a strength of 16,000 men, including Kautz&#x27;s cavalry division, and use the same route employed in the unsuccessful attacks of June 9. Since Beauregard had insufficient men available to defend the entire Dimmock defensive line, he concentrated 2,200 troops under Wise in the northeastern sector. Even with this concentration, infantrymen were spaced an unacceptable apart. His remaining 3,200 men were facing Butler&#x27;s army at Bermuda Hundred.

Smith and his men crossed the Appomattox shortly after dawn on June 15. Kautz&#x27;s cavalry, leading the advance, encountered an unexpected stronghold at Baylor&#x27;s farm northeast of Petersburg. Hinks&#x27;s men launched two attacks on the Confederates and captured a cannon, but the overall advance was delayed until early afternoon. Smith started his attack after delaying until about 7 p.m., deploying a strong skirmish line that swept over the earthworks on a front, causing the Confederates to retreat to a weaker defensive line on Harrison&#x27;s Creek. Despite this initial success and the prospect of a virtually undefended city immediately to his front, Smith decided to wait until dawn to resume his attack. By this time Hancock, the II Corps commander, had arrived at Smith&#x27;s headquarters. The normally decisive and pugnacious Hancock, who outranked Smith, was uncertain of his orders and the disposition of forces, and uncharacteristically deferred to Smith&#x27;s judgment to wait.

Beauregard wrote later that Petersburg &quot;at that hour was clearly at the mercy of the Federal commander, who had all but captured it.&quot; But he used the time he had been granted to good advantage. Receiving no guidance from Richmond in response to his urgent requests, he unilaterally decided to strip his defenses from the Howlett defensive line, which was bottling up Butler&#x27;s army in Bermuda Hundred. This made the divisions under Hoke and Johnson available for the new Petersburg defensive line. Butler might have used this opportunity to move his army between Petersburg and Richmond, which would have doomed the Confederate capital, but he once again failed to act.

By the morning of June 16, Beauregard had concentrated about 14,000 men in his defensive line, but this paled in comparison to the 50,000 federals that now faced him. Grant had arrived with Burnside&#x27;s IX Corps, addressed the confusion of Hancock&#x27;s orders, and ordered a reconnaissance for weak points in the defensive line. Hancock, in temporary command of the Army of the Potomac until Meade arrived, prepared Smith&#x27;s XVIII corps on the right, his own II Corps in the center, and Burnside&#x27;s IX Corps on the left. Hancock&#x27;s assault began around 5:30 p.m. as all three corps moved slowly forward. Beauregard&#x27;s men fought fiercely, erecting new breastworks to the rear as breakthroughs occurred. Upon the arrival of Meade, a second attack was ordered and led his division forward. Although Barlow&#x27;s men managed to capture their objectives, a counterattack drove them back, taking numerous Union prisoners. The survivors dug in close to the enemy works.

June 17 was a day of uncoordinated Union attacks, starting on the left flank where two brigades of Burnside&#x27;s IX Corps under Potter stealthily approached the Confederate line and launched a surprise attack at dawn. Initially successful, it captured nearly a mile of the Confederate fortifications and about 600 prisoners, but the effort eventually failed when Potter&#x27;s men moved forward to find another line of entrenchments. IX Corps assaults at 2 p.m., led by the brigade of Brigadier General John F. Hartranft, and in the evening, by Ledlie&#x27;s division, both failed.

During the day, Beauregard&#x27;s engineers had laid out new defensive positions a mile to the west of the Dimmock line, which the Confederates occupied late that night. Lee had systematically ignored all of Beauregard&#x27;s pleas for reinforcements until now, but dispatched two divisions of his men, exhausted from the Overland campaign, to Petersburg, beginning at 3 a.m. on June 18. With the arrival of Lee&#x27;s two divisions, under Kershaw and Field, Beauregard had over 20,000 men to defend the city, but Grant&#x27;s force had been augmented by the arrival of Warren&#x27;s V Corps and 67,000 Federals were present.

On the morning of June 18, Meade went into a rage directed at his corps commanders because of his army&#x27;s failure to take the initiative and break through the thinly defended Confederate positions and seize the city. He ordered the entire Army of the Potomac to attack the Confederate defenses. The first Union attack began at dawn, started by the II and XVIII Corps on the Union right. The II Corps was surprised to make rapid progress against the Confederate line, not realizing that Beauregard had moved it back the night before. When they encountered the second line, the attack immediately ground to a halt and the corps suffered under heavy Confederate fire for hours.

By noon, another attack plan had been devised to break through the Confederate defenses. However, by this time, elements of Lee&#x27;s army had reinforced Beauregard&#x27;s troops. By the time the Union attack was renewed, Lee himself had taken command of the defenses. Willcox&#x27;s division of the IX Corps led the renewed attack but it suffered significant losses in the marsh and open fields crossed by the watercourse, Taylor&#x27;s Branch. Warren&#x27;s V Corps was halted by murderous fire from the position known as Rives&#x27; salient, an attack in which Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, commanding the 1st Brigade, First Division, V Corps, was severely wounded. At 6:30 p.m., Meade ordered a final assault, which also failed with more horrendous losses. One of the leading regiments was the 1st Maine Heavy Artillery Regiment, which lost 632 of 900 men in the assault, the heaviest single-battle loss of any regiment during the entire war.

Having achieved almost no gains from four days of assaults, and with Lincoln facing re-election in the upcoming months in the face of a loud public outcry against the casualty figures, Meade ordered his army to dig in, starting the ten-month siege. During the four days of fighting, Union casualties were 11,386 (1,688 killed, 8,513 wounded, 1,185 missing or captured), while Confederate casualties were 4,000 (200 killed, 2,900 wounded, 900 missing or captured).

==Initial attempts to cut the railroads (June 21–30)==
After failing to capture Petersburg by assault, Grant&#x27;s first objective was to secure the three remaining open rail lines that served Petersburg and Richmond: the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad; the South Side Railroad, which reached to Lynchburg in the west; and the Weldon Railroad, also called the Petersburg and Weldon Railroad, which led to Weldon, North Carolina, and the Confederacy&#x27;s only remaining major port, Wilmington, North Carolina. Grant decided on a wide-ranging cavalry raid (the Wilson–Kautz Raid) against the South Side and Weldon railroads, but he also directed that a significant infantry force be sent against the Weldon closer to his current position. Meade selected the II Corps, still temporarily commanded by Birney, and Wright&#x27;s VI Corps.

===Jerusalem Plank Road (June 21–23)===

On June 21, elements of the II Corps probed toward the railroad and skirmished with Confederate cavalry. By the morning of June 22, a gap opened up between the two corps. While the II Corps moved forward, the VI Corps encountered Confederate troops from Wilcox&#x27;s division of Hill&#x27;s corps and they began to entrench rather than advance. Mahone observed that the gap between the two Union corps was widening, creating a prime target. Mahone had been a railroad engineer before the war and had personally surveyed this area south of Petersburg, so he was familiar with a ravine that could be used to hide the approach of a Confederate attack column. At 3 p.m., Mahone&#x27;s men emerged in the rear Barlow&#x27;s division (II Corps), catching them by surprise, and the division quickly collapsed. Gibbon&#x27;s division, which had erected earthworks, was also surprised by an attack from the rear and many of the regiments ran for safety. The II Corps troops rallied around earthworks that they had constructed on the night of June 21 and stabilized their lines. Darkness ended the fighting.

On June 23, the II Corps advanced to retake its lost ground, but the Confederates had pulled back, abandoning the earthworks they had captured. Under orders from Meade, the VI Corps sent out a heavy skirmish line after 10 a.m. in a second attempt to reach the Weldon Railroad. Men from Brigadier General Lewis A. Grant&#x27;s 1st Vermont Brigade had begun tearing up the track when they were attacked by a larger force of Confederate infantry. Numerous Vermonters were taken prisoner and only about half a mile of track had been destroyed when they were chased away. Meade was unable to urge Wright forward and called off the operation. Union casualties were 2,962 and Confederate 572. The battle was inconclusive, with advantages gained on both sides. The Confederates were able to retain control of the Weldon Railroad. The Federals were able to destroy a short segment of the Weldon before being driven off, but more importantly, the siege lines were stretched further to the west.

===Wilson–Kautz Raid (June 22 – July 1) ===

In parallel to Birney&#x27;s and Wright&#x27;s infantry action at the Jerusalem Plank Road, Wilson was ordered by Meade to conduct a raid destroying as much track as possible south and southwest of Petersburg. Grant considered Wilson&#x27;s 3rd Division of the Cavalry Corps too small to conduct the operation alone, particularly since Meade required Wilson to leave 1,400 men behind for picket duty, so he directed Butler to contribute Kautz&#x27;s small division (2,000 troopers) to the effort. Early on the morning of June 22, 3,300 men, and 12 guns organized into two batteries, departed Mount Sinai Church and began to destroy railroad track and cars of the Weldon Railroad at Reams Station, south of Petersburg. Kautz&#x27;s men moved to the west to Ford&#x27;s Station and began destroying track, locomotives, and cars on the South Side Railroad.

On June 23, Wilson proceeded to the junction of the Richmond and Danville Railroad at Burkeville, where he encountered elements of Rooney Lee&#x27;s cavalry between Nottoway Court House and Black&#x27;s and White&#x27;s (modern-day Blackstone). The Confederates struck the rear of his column, forcing Colonel George A. Chapman&#x27;s brigade to fend them off. Wilson followed Kautz along the South Side Railroad, destroying about 30 miles (50 km) of track as they went. On June 24, while Kautz remained to skirmish around Burkeville, Wilson crossed over to Meherrin Station on the Richmond and Danville and began destroying track.

On June 25, Wilson and Kautz continued tearing up track south to the Staunton River Bridge at Roanoke Station (modern-day Randolph), where they encountered approximately 1,000 &quot;old men and boys&quot; (the Home Guard), commanded by Captain Benjamin L. Farinholt, dug in with earthworks and prepared artillery positions at the bridge. The Battle of Staunton River Bridge was a minor affair in which Kautz attempted multiple frontal assaults against the Home Guard, but his men never came closer than . Lee&#x27;s cavalry division closed on the Federals from the northeast and skirmished with Wilson&#x27;s rear guard. Casualties on the Union side amounted to 42 killed, 44 wounded, and 30 missing or captured. Confederate losses were 10 killed and 24 wounded. Kautz&#x27;s men gave up and retreated to the railroad depot at 9 p.m. Despite these relatively minor losses, the two Union cavalry generals decided to abandon their mission, leaving the Staunton River bridge intact and having inflicted only minor damage on the railroads.

As Wilson and Kautz turned back to the east after their defeat at Staunton River Bridge, Lee&#x27;s cavalry pursued and threatened their rear. Meanwhile, Robert E. Lee ordered Hampton&#x27;s cavalry, which had been engaged with Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry at the Battle of Trevilian Station on June 11–12, to join the pursuit and attack Wilson and Kautz. Before leaving on his raid, Wilson had received assurances from Meade&#x27;s chief of staff, Major General Andrew A. Humphreys, that the Army of the Potomac would be immediately taking control of the Weldon Railroad at least as far south as Reams Station, so Wilson decided that would be an appropriate place to return to Union lines. The Union defeat at Jerusalem Plank Road made those assurances inoperable. Wilson and Kautz were surprised on the afternoon of June 28 when they reached Stony Creek Station, south of Reams, as hundreds of Hampton&#x27;s cavalrymen (under Brigadier General John R. Chambliss) and infantry blocked their path. In the Battle of Sappony Church, Wilson&#x27;s men tried to break through but had to fall back when Confederate brigadier generals Matthew C. Butler and Thomas L. Rosser threatened to envelop Wilson&#x27;s left flank. Kautz&#x27;s division, following Wilson&#x27;s, took a back road in the direction of Reams Station and was attacked by Lee&#x27;s division late in the day. The Union cavalrymen were able to slip out of the trap under the cover of darkness and rode north on the Halifax Road for the supposed security of Reams Station.

In the First Battle of Reams Station on June 29, Kautz approached Reams Station from the west expecting to find the friendly infantry promised by Humphreys but found Confederate infantry instead—Mahone&#x27;s division blocking the approaches to the Halifax Road and the railroad behind well-constructed earthworks. Kautz&#x27;s attack by the 11th Pennsylvania and the 1st District of Columbia Cavalry along the Depot Road was unsuccessful and Mahone counterattacked against the flank of the Pennsylvanians. On the Stage Road to the north of the station, the brigades of brigadier generals Lunsford L. Lomax and Williams C. Wickham maneuvered around the 2nd Ohio Cavalry and 5th New York Cavalry, turning the Federal left flank. Wilson sent a messenger north who was able to slip through the Confederate lines and urgently requested help from Meade at City Point. Meade alerted Wright to prepare to move his entire VI Corps to Reams Station, but he realized that it would take too long on foot and requested help from Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry as well. Sheridan demurred, complaining of the effect on his &quot;worn-out horses and exhausted men.&quot; After the war, arguments persisted between Sheridan and Wilson about whether the former had adequately protected the raiders from the Confederate cavalry of Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee. Sheridan did reach Reams Station by 7 p.m., only to find that the VI Corps infantry had in fact arrived but that Wilson and Kautz had departed.

Caught in a trap without the promise of immediate aid, the Wilson–Kautz raiders burned their wagons and destroyed their artillery pieces and fled to the north before the reinforcements arrived. They lost hundreds of men as prisoners in what was called &quot;a wild skedaddle.&quot; At least 300 escaped slaves who had joined the Union cavalrymen during the raid were abandoned during the retreat. The raiders reentered Federal lines around 2 p.m. on July 1. They had destroyed of track, which took the Confederates several weeks to repair, but it came at the cost of 1,445 Union casualties, or about a quarter of their force. Wilson lost 33 killed, 108 wounded, and 674 captured or missing. Kautz lost 48 killed, 153 wounded, and 429 captured or missing. Although Wilson counted the raid as a strategic success, Grant reluctantly described the expedition as a &quot;disaster.&quot;

==First Battle of Deep Bottom (July 27–29)==

In preparation for the forthcoming Battle of the Crater, Grant wanted Lee to dilute his forces in the Petersburg trenches by attracting them elsewhere. He ordered Hancock&#x27;s II Corps and two divisions of Sheridan&#x27;s Cavalry Corps to cross the James River to Deep Bottom by pontoon bridge and advance against the Confederate capital. His plan called for Hancock to pin down the Confederates at Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff and prevent reinforcements from opposing Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry, which would attack Richmond if practicable. If not—a circumstance Grant considered more likely—Sheridan was ordered to ride around the city to the north and west and cut the Virginia Central Railroad, which was supplying Richmond from the Shenandoah Valley.

When Lee found out about Hancock&#x27;s pending movement, he ordered that the Richmond lines be reinforced to 16,500 men. Kershaw&#x27;s division and brigades from Wilcox&#x27;s division moved east on New Market Road and took up positions on the eastern face of New Market Heights. Hancock and Sheridan crossed the pontoon bridge starting at 3 a.m., July 27. II Corps took up positions on the east bank of Bailey&#x27;s Creek, from New Market Road to near Fussell&#x27;s Mill. Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry captured the high ground on the right, overlooking the millpond, but they were counterattacked and driven back. The Confederate works on the west bank of Bailey&#x27;s Creek were formidable and Hancock chose not to attack them, spending the rest of the day performing reconnaissance.

While Hancock was checked at Bailey&#x27;s Creek, Lee began bringing up more reinforcements from Petersburg, reacting as Grant had hoped. He assigned Anderson to take command of the Deep Bottom sector and sent in Heth&#x27;s infantry division &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee&#x27;s cavalry division. Troops were also hurriedly detailed from the Department of Richmond to help man the trenches.

On the morning of July 28, Grant reinforced Hancock with a brigade of the XIX Corps. Sheridan&#x27;s men attempted to turn the Confederate left, but their movement was disrupted by a Confederate attack. Three brigades attacked Sheridan&#x27;s right flank, but they were unexpectedly hit by heavy fire from the Union repeating carbines. Mounted Federals in Sheridan&#x27;s reserve pursued and captured nearly 200 prisoners.

Satisfied that the operation had distracted sufficient Confederate forces from the defense of Petersburg the Federal attacks ended in the afternoon of July 28. Grant then proceed with a renewed assault against Petersburg on July 30.

Union casualties at the First Battle of Deep Bottom were 488 (62 killed, 340 wounded, and 86 missing or captured). Confederate casualties were 679 (80 killed, 391 wounded, 208 missing or captured).

==The Crater (July 30) ==

Grant wanted to defeat Lee&#x27;s army without resorting to a lengthy siege—his experience in the siege of Vicksburg told him that such affairs were expensive and difficult on the morale of his men. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Pleasants, commanding the 48th Pennsylvania Infantry of Burnside&#x27;s IX Corps, offered a novel proposal to solve Grant&#x27;s problem. Pleasants, a mining engineer from Pennsylvania in civilian life, proposed digging a long mine shaft underneath the Confederate lines and planting explosive charges directly underneath a fort (Elliott&#x27;s Salient) in the middle of the Confederate First Corps line. If successful, Union troops could drive through the resulting gap in the line into the Confederate rear area. Digging began in late June, creating a mine in a &quot;T&quot; shape with an approach shaft long. At its end, a perpendicular gallery of extended in both directions. The gallery was filled with pounds of gunpowder, buried underneath the Confederate works.

Burnside had trained the division of USCTs under Ferrero to lead the assault. Two regiments were to leave the attack column and extend the breach by rushing perpendicular to the crater, while the remaining regiments were to rush through, seizing the Jerusalem Plank Road. Burnside&#x27;s two other divisions, made up of white troops, would then move in, supporting Ferrero&#x27;s flanks and race for Petersburg itself. However, the day before the attack, Meade, who lacked confidence in the operation, ordered Burnside not to use the black troops in the lead assault, claiming that if the attack failed black soldiers would be killed needlessly, creating political repercussions in the North. Burnside protested to Grant, who sided with Meade. When volunteers were not forthcoming, Burnside selected a replacement white division by having the three commanders draw lots. Ledlie&#x27;s 1st Division was selected, but he failed to brief the men on what was expected of them. During the battle, Ledlie was reportedly drunk well behind the lines and providing no leadership. He was later dismissed for his actions during the battle.
At 4:44 a.m. on July 30, the charges were exploded. A crater (still visible today) was created long by 60 to wide and deep. The blast destroyed the Confederate fortifications in the immediate vicinity and instantly killed between 250 and 350 Confederate soldiers. Ledlie&#x27;s untrained division was not prepared for the explosion and reports indicate they waited ten minutes before leaving their own entrenchments. Instead of moving around the crater as Ferrero&#x27;s troops had been trained to do, they moved down into the crater itself. Since this was not the planned movement, there were no ladders provided for the men to use in exiting the crater. Mahone assembled a counterattacking force. By about an hour later, they had formed up around the crater and began firing rifles and artillery down into it, in what Mahone later described as a &quot;turkey shoot&quot;. The plan had failed but Burnside, instead of cutting his losses, sent in Ferrero&#x27;s men. Now faced with considerable flanking fire, they also went down into the crater and for the next few hours, Mahone&#x27;s soldiers, reinforced by Johnson and artillery, slaughtered the men of the IX Corps as they attempted to escape from the crater. Some Union troops eventually advanced and flanked to the right beyond the crater to the earthworks and assaulted the Confederate lines, driving the Confederates back for several hours in hand-to-hand combat. Mahone&#x27;s Confederates conducted a sweep out of a sunken gully area about from the right side of the Union advance. This charge reclaimed the earthworks and drove the Union force back towards the east.

Confederate casualties were approximately 1,500 (200 killed, 900 wounded, 400 missing or captured). Union casualties were 3,798 (504 killed, 1,881 wounded, 1,413 missing or captured). Grant wrote that, &quot;It was the saddest affair I have witnessed in the war.&quot; Many of the Union casualties were suffered by Ferrero&#x27;s division. Burnside was relieved of command.

==Second Deep Bottom (August 14–20)==

On the same day the Union failed at the Crater, Early, commanding the Confederate Second Corps, was burning the town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, as he operated out of the Shenandoah Valley, threatening towns in Maryland and Pennsylvania, as well as the District of Columbia. Lee was concerned about actions that Grant might take against Early and sent the Kershaw&#x27;s infantry division from Anderson&#x27;s corps and the cavalry division commanded Fitzhugh Lee to Culpeper, Virginia, where they could either provide aid to Early or be recalled to the Richmond-Petersburg front as needed. Grant misinterpreted this movement and assumed that Anderson&#x27;s entire corps had been removed from the vicinity of Richmond, leaving only about 8,500 men north of the James River. He determined to try again with an advance toward the Confederate capital led by Hancock. This would either prevent reinforcements from aiding Early or once again dilute the Confederate strength in the defensive lines around Petersburg.

On August 13, X Corps, commanded by Birney, and Gregg&#x27;s cavalry division crossed pontoon bridges from Bermuda Hundred to Deep Bottom. II Corps crossed by steamships the night of August 13–14. Birney&#x27;s troops successfully pushed aside pickets on the Kingsland Road, but were stopped by the fortifications on New Market Heights. The II Corps units moved slowly into position, suffering numerous deaths from heat stroke.

It was not until midday on August 14 that the Union made contact with the Confederates, manning rifle pits on the Darbytown Road just north of the Long Bridge Road. The Union generals were surprised at the Confederate strength. On the right, a full Confederate division commanded by Field was dug in. Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff was defended by a division under Wilcox and reinforcements were arriving. Barlow&#x27;s 10,000 men in two divisions of II Corps attacked Fussell&#x27;s Mill. They were able to drive away two Confederate cavalry regiments at the mill, but they were repulsed by Brigadier General George T. Anderson&#x27;s brigade. When Field took Anderson&#x27;s brigade from his right flank, it weakened the line in front of Birney&#x27;s corps, which moved forward and occupied some of the Confederate entrenchments and captured four guns.

Although the Union attacks had been generally unsuccessful, they had some of the effect Grant desired. Lee became convinced that the threat against Richmond was a serious one and he dispatched two infantry brigades of Mahone&#x27;s division and the cavalry divisions of Hampton and &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee. Hancock ordered Birney&#x27;s corps to make a night march to join Barlow&#x27;s end of the line. Birney&#x27;s movement was delayed by difficult terrain for most of August 15 and Hancock&#x27;s plan for an attack was abandoned for the day.

On August 16, Gregg&#x27;s cavalry swept to the right and rode northwest on the Charles City Road toward Richmond. They found Rooney Lee&#x27;s cavalry division blocking the road and a full day of fighting resulted. Confederate Brigadier General Chambliss was killed during the fighting. The infantrymen of the X Corps had a better start to the day, as Terry&#x27;s division broke through the Confederate line. Brigadier General Ambrose R. Wright&#x27;s brigade was hit hard and retreated, opening a significant gap. The heavily wooded terrain prevented Birney and Hancock from understanding that they had reached a position of advantage and they were unable to exploit it before Field rearranged his lines to fill the gap and drive back the Federals.

Lee planned a counterattack against the Union right for 11 a.m. on August 18, but it was poorly coordinated and made no significant gains. On the night of August 20, Hancock withdrew his force back over the James. Union casualties were approximately 2,900 men, some due to heat stroke. Confederate casualties were 1,500.

==Operations against the Weldon Railroad==

===Globe Tavern (August 18–21)===

While II Corps fought at Deep Bottom, Grant planned another attack against the Weldon. He chose Warren&#x27;s V Corps to lead the operation. Grant was encouraged by a message he received August 17 from Lincoln:

Grant remarked to his staff, &quot;The President has more nerve than any of his advisors.&quot;

At dawn on August 18, Warren advanced to the south and reached the railroad at Globe Tavern around 9 a.m. Parts of the division under Griffin began to destroy the track while a brigade from Ayres&#x27; division formed in line of battle and moved north to block any Confederate advance from that direction. Ayres encountered Confederate troops at about 1 p.m. and Warren ordered the division under Crawford to move forward on Ayres&#x27; right in an attempt to outflank the Confederate left. Hill sent three brigades to meet the advancing Union divisions. At about 2 p.m. they launched a strong attack and pushed the Union troops back to within less than a mile of Globe Tavern. Warren counterattacked and regained his lost ground. His men entrenched for the night.

Reinforcements arrived during the night—the Union IX Corps under Parke and, three infantry brigades from Mahone&#x27;s division and &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee&#x27;s cavalry division. In the late afternoon of August 19, Mahone launched a flanking attack that found a weak spot in Crawford&#x27;s line, causing hundreds of Crawford&#x27;s men to flee in panic. Heth launched a frontal assault against the center and left, which was easily repulsed by Ayres&#x27; division. XI Corps counterattacked and fighting ended at dusk. On the night of August 20–21, Warren pulled his troops back two miles (3 km) to a new line of fortifications, which were connected with the main Union lines on the Jerusalem Plank Road. The Confederates attacked at 9 a.m. on August 21, with Mahone striking the Federal left and Heth the center. Both attacks were unsuccessful against the strong entrenchments and resulted in heavy losses. By 10:30 a.m., the Confederates withdrew.

Union casualties at Globe Tavern were 4,296 (251 killed, 1,148 wounded, 2,897 missing/captured). Confederate casualties were 1,620 (211 killed, 990 wounded, 419 missing/captured). The Confederates had lost a key section of the Weldon Railroad and were forced to carry supplies by wagon from the railroad at Stony Creek up the Boydton Plank Road into Petersburg. This was not yet a critical problem for the Confederates. A member of Lee&#x27;s staff wrote, &quot;Whilst we are inconvenienced, no material harm is done us.&quot; Grant was not entirely satisfied with Warren&#x27;s victory, which he rightly characterized as wholly defensive in nature.

Globe Tavern was the first Union victory of the campaign.

===Second Reams Station (August 25)===
Grant wanted the Weldon line closed permanently by destroying of track from Warren&#x27;s position near Globe Tavern as far south as Rowanty Creek (about north of the town of Stony Creek). He assigned the operation to Hancock&#x27;s II Corps, which was in the process of moving south from their operation at Deep Bottom. While Hancock&#x27;s corps was exhausted from their efforts north of the James and their forced march south, Warren&#x27;s troops were tasked with extending the fortifications at Globe Tavern. Grant augmented Hancock&#x27;s corps with Gregg&#x27;s cavalry division. Gregg&#x27;s division departed on August 22. After driving off Confederate pickets, they and the II Corps infantry division commanded by Brigadier General Nelson A. Miles destroyed the railroad tracks to within of Reams Station. Early on August 23, Hancock&#x27;s other division, commanded by Gibbon, occupied Reams Station, taking up positions in earthworks that had been constructed by the Union cavalry during the Wilson–Kautz Raid in June.

Lee considered that the Union troops at Reams Station represented not only a threat to his supply line, but also to the county seat of Dinwiddie County. If Dinwiddie Court House were to fall, the Confederates would be forced to evacuate both Petersburg and Richmond because it represented a key point on the army&#x27;s potential withdrawal route. He also saw an opportunity—that he could impose a strategic defeat upon the Union Army shortly before the presidential election in November. Lee ordered Hill to take the overall command of a combined cavalry and infantry force of 8,000–10,000 men.

Wilcox&#x27;s division assaulted the Union position at about 2 p.m. on August 25. Despite launching two attacks, Wilcox was driven back by Miles&#x27;s division, which was manning the northern part of the earthworks. To the south, Gibbon&#x27;s division was blocking the advance of Hampton&#x27;s cavalry, which had swept around the Union line. Confederate reinforcements from Heth&#x27;s and Mahone&#x27;s divisions arrived while the Confederate artillery bombarded the Union position. The final attack began around 5:30 p.m. against Miles&#x27;s position and it broke through the northwest corner of the Union fortifications. Hancock galloped from one threatened point to the next, attempting to rally his men. As he witnessed the men of his corps reluctant to retake their positions from the enemy, he remarked to a colonel, &quot;I do not care to die, but I pray God I may never leave this field.&quot; By this time, Hampton&#x27;s cavalry was making progress against Gibbon&#x27;s infantry to the south, launching a surprise dismounted attack that caused many of Gibbon&#x27;s men to flee or surrender. This allowed Hampton to flank Miles. Hancock ordered a counterattack, which provided time to allow for an orderly Union withdrawal to Petersburg after dark.

The Union suffered approximately 2,700 casualies and the Confederate approximately 800. Although the Confederates had won a clear victory, they had lost a vital piece of the Weldon Railroad. From this point on they were only able to transport supplies by rail on this line as far north as the Stony Creek Depot, south of Petersburg. From there, supplies then had to be unloaded and tranported by wagon to Petersburg. The South Side Railroad was the only railroad left to directly supply Petersburg and Lee&#x27;s army.

==Beefsteak Raid (September 14–17)==
On September 5, a Confederate scout gave a report to Hampton on his reconnaissance behind the Union lines. At a supply depot at Coggins Point on the James River, he found approximately 3,000 beef cattle, attended by 120 men and 30 citizens, without arms. Just two days earlier, Lee had suggested to Hampton that Grant&#x27;s rear area was &quot;open to attack.&quot; On September 14 Hampton led about 4,000 men in four brigades southwest from Petersburg along the Boydton Plank Road and followed course through Dinwiddie Court House, Stony Creek Station. By the morning of September 15 the force had crossed Blackwater Swamp at Cook&#x27;s Bridge. In the early morning of September 16, Hampton launched a surprise attack which met only minimal resistance. Hampton&#x27;s men drove the captured herd of 2,486 cattle south toward Cook&#x27;s Bridge. An attempted intervention by 2,100 Union cavalrymen under Brigadier General Henry Davies was unsuccessful. Hampton was able to retraced his steps back to Petersburg and turned the cattle over to the Confederate commissary department. For days, the Confederate troops feasted on beef and taunted their Union counterparts across the lines. A visitor to Grant&#x27;s headquarters asked the general, &quot;When do you expect to starve out Lee and capture Richmond?&quot; Grant replied, &quot;Never, if our armies continue to supply him with beef cattle.&quot;

==Union offensives, late September==

===New Market Heights (September 29–30)===
During the night of September 28–29, Butler&#x27;s Army of the James crossed the James River to assault the Richmond defenses north of the river. The columns attacked at dawn. After initial Union successes at New Market Heights and Fort Harrison, the Confederates rallied and contained the breakthrough. Lee reinforced his lines north of the James and, on September 30, he counterattacked unsuccessfully. The Federals entrenched, and the Confederates erected a new line of works cutting off the captured forts. As Grant anticipated, Lee shifted troops to meet the threat against Richmond, weakening his lines at Petersburg.

===Peebles Farm (September 30 – October 2)===
In combination with Butler&#x27;s offensive north of the James River, Grant extended his left flank to cut Confederate lines of communication southwest of Petersburg. Two divisions of the IX corps under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, two divisions of the V Corps under Warren, and Gregg&#x27;s cavalry division were assigned to the operation. On September 30, the Federals marched via Poplar Spring Church to reach Squirrel Level and Vaughan Roads. The initial Federal attack overran Fort Archer, flanking the Confederates out of their Squirrel Level Road line. Late afternoon, Confederate reinforcements arrived, slowing the Federal advance. On October 1, the Federals repulsed a Confederate counterattack directed by A.P. Hill. Reinforced by Maj. Gen. Gershom Mott&#x27;s division, the Federals resumed their advance on October 2, captured Fort MacRae (which was lightly defended) and extended their left flank to the vicinity of Peebles&#x27; and Pegram&#x27;s Farms. With these limited successes, Meade suspended the offensive. A new line was entrenched from the Federal works on Weldon Railroad to Pegram&#x27;s Farm.

==Actions near Richmond, October==

===Darbytown and New Market Roads (October 7)===
Responding to the loss of Fort Harrison and the increasing Federal threat against Richmond, Gen. Robert E. Lee directed an offensive against the Union far right flank on October 7. After routing the Federal cavalry from their position covering Darbytown Road, Field&#x27;s and Hoke&#x27;s divisions assaulted the main Union defensive line along New Market Road and were repulsed. The Federals were not dislodged, and Lee withdrew into the Richmond defenses.

===Darbytown Road (October 13)===
On October 13, Union forces advanced to find and feel the new Confederate defensive line in front of Richmond. While mostly a battle of skirmishers, a Federal brigade assaulted fortifications north of Darbytown Road and was repulsed with heavy casualties. The Federals retired to their entrenched lines along New Market Road.

===Fair Oaks and Darbytown Road (October 27–28)===
In combination with movements against the Boydton Plank Road at Petersburg, Benjamin Butler attacked the Richmond defenses along Darbytown Road with the X Corps. The XVIII Corps marched north to Fair Oaks where it was soundly repulsed by Field&#x27;s Confederate division. Confederate forces counterattacked, taking some 600 prisoners. The Richmond defenses remained intact. Of Grant&#x27;s offensives north of the James River, this was repulsed most easily.

==Boydton Plank Road (October 27–28)==

Directed by Hancock, divisions from three Union corps (II, V, and IX) and Gregg&#x27;s cavalry division, numbering more than 30,000 men, withdrew from the Petersburg lines and marched west to operate against the Boydton Plank Road and South Side Railroad. The initial Union advance on October 27 gained the Boydton Plank Road, a major campaign objective. But that afternoon, a counterattack near Burgess&#x27; Mill spearheaded by Henry Heth&#x27;s division, and Wade Hampton&#x27;s cavalry isolated the II Corps and forced a retreat. The Confederates retained control of the Boydton Plank Road for the rest of the winter. It marked the last battle for Hancock, who resigned from field command because of wounds sustained at Gettysburg.

==Hatcher&#x27;s Run (February 5–7, 1865)==
On February 5, 1865, Gregg&#x27;s cavalry division rode out to the Boydton Plank Road via Ream&#x27;s Station and Dinwiddie Court House in an attempt to intercept Confederate supply trains. Warren&#x27;s V Corps crossed Hatcher&#x27;s Run and took up a blocking position on the Vaughan Road to prevent interference with Gregg&#x27;s operations. Two divisions of the II Corps under Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys shifted west to near Armstrong&#x27;s Mill to cover Warren&#x27;s right flank. Late in the day, John B. Gordon attempted to turn Humphrey&#x27;s right flank near the mill but was repulsed. During the night, the Federals were reinforced by two divisions. On February 6, Gregg returned to Gravelly Run on Vaughan Road from his unsuccessful raid and was attacked by elements of Brig. Gen. John Pegram&#x27;s Confederate division. Warren pushed forward a reconnaissance in the vicinity of Dabney&#x27;s Mill and was attacked by Pegram&#x27;s and Mahone&#x27;s divisions. Pegram was killed in the action. Although the Union advance was stopped, the Federals extended their siegeworks to the Vaughan Road crossing of Hatcher&#x27;s Run.

==Confederate breakout attempt at Fort Stedman (March 25)==

By March, Lee&#x27;s army was weakened by desertion, disease, and shortage of supplies and he was outnumbered by Grant by about 125,000 to 50,000. Lee knew that an additional 50,000 men under Sheridan would be returning soon from the Shenandoah Valley and Sherman was marching north through the Carolinas to join Grant as well. Lee had Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon plan a surprise attack on the Union lines that would force Grant to contract his lines and disrupt his plans to assault the Confederate works (which, unbeknownst to Lee and Gordon, Grant had already ordered for March 29). The attack would be launched with almost half of Lee&#x27;s infantry from Colquitt&#x27;s Salient against Fort Stedman, and Gordon had hopes that he could drive into the Union rear area as far as City Point.

Gordon&#x27;s attack started at 4:15 a.m. Lead parties of sharpshooters and engineers masquerading as deserting soldiers headed out to overwhelm Union pickets and to remove obstructions that would delay the infantry advance. They were followed by three groups of 100 men assigned to storm the Union works and stream back into the Union rear area. Realizing there was a breach in his lines, US Brig. Gen. Napoleon B. McLaughlen rode to Fort Haskell, just to the south of Battery XII, which he found to be ready to defend itself. As he moved north, he ordered Battery XII to open fire on Battery XI and a reserve infantry regiment briefly re-captured Battery XI. Assuming that he had sealed the only breach in the line, McLaughlen rode into Fort Stedman and began giving orders to the men. He suddenly realized that they were Confederates and they realized he was a Union general, capturing him.

Gordon soon arrived at Fort Stedman and found his attack had so far exceeded his &quot;most sanguine expectations.&quot; Within minutes, Batteries X, XI, and XII and Fort Stedman had been seized, opening a gap nearly long in the Union line. Gordon turned his attention to the southern flank of his attack and Fort Haskell. The Confederate artillery from Colquitt&#x27;s Salient began bombarding Fort Haskell and the Federal field artillery returned fire, along with the massive siege guns in the rear.

Gordon&#x27;s attack began to flounder. His three 100-man detachments were wandering around the rear area in confusion and many had stopped to satisfy their hunger with captured Federal rations, as the main Union defense force began to mobilize. Maj. Gen. John G. Parke of the IX Corps acted decisively, ordering the reserve division under Brig. Gen. John F. Hartranft to close the gap. Hartranft organized defensive forces that completely ringed the Confederate penetration by 7:30 a.m., stopping it just short of the military railroad depot. The Union artillery, aware that Confederates occupied the batteries and Fort Stedman, launched punishing fire against them. By 7:45 a.m., 4,000 Union troops under Hartranft were positioned in a semicircle of a mile and a half, and counterattacked, causing heavy casualties to the now-retreating Confederates.

The attack on Fort Stedman had no impact on the Union lines. The Confederate Army was forced to set back its own lines, as the Union attacked further down the front line. To give Gordon&#x27;s attack enough strength to be successful, Lee had weakened his own right flank. The II and VI Corps seized much of the entrenched Confederate picket line southwest of Petersburg, but found the main line still well manned. This Union advance prepared the ground for Grant&#x27;s breakthrough attack in the Third Battle of Petersburg on April 2, 1865.

Union casualties in the Battle of Fort Stedman were 1,044 (72 killed, 450 wounded, 522 missing or captured), Confederate casualties a considerably heavier 4,000 (600 killed, 2,400 wounded, 1,000 missing or captured). But more seriously, the Confederate positions were weakened. After the battle, Lee&#x27;s defeat was only a matter of time. His final opportunity to break the Union lines and regain the momentum was gone.

==Aftermath==
After nearly ten months of siege, the loss at Fort Stedman was a devastating blow for Lee&#x27;s army, setting up the Confederate defeat at Five Forks on April 1, the Union breakthrough at Petersburg on April 2, the surrender of the city of Petersburg at dawn on April 3, and Richmond that same evening.

After his victory at Five Forks, Grant ordered an assault along the entire Confederate line beginning at dawn on April 2. Parke&#x27;s IX Corps overran the eastern trenches but were met with stiff resistance. At 5:30 a.m. on April 2, Wright&#x27;s VI Corps made a decisive breakthrough along the Boydton Plank Road line. While riding between the lines to rally his men, A.P. Hill was shot and killed by two Union soldiers. Wright&#x27;s initial breakthrough was halted mid-day at Fort Gregg. Gibbon&#x27;s XXIV Corps overran Fort Gregg after a strong Confederate defense. This halt in the advance into the city of Petersburg allowed Lee to pull his forces out of Petersburg and Richmond on the night of April 2, and head for the west in an attempt to meet up with forces under the command of Johnston in North Carolina. The resulting Appomattox Campaign ended with Lee&#x27;s surrender to Grant on April 9 at Appomattox Court House.

Richmond–Petersburg was a costly campaign for both sides. The initial assaults on Petersburg in June 1864 cost the Union 11,386 casualties, to approximately 4,000 for the Confederate defenders. The casualties for the siege warfare that concluded with the assault on Fort Stedman are estimated to be 42,000 for the Union and 28,000 for the Confederates.

==Classifying the campaigns ==
Military historians do not agree on precise boundaries between the campaigns of this era. This article uses the classification maintained by the U.S. National Park Service&#x27;s American Battlefield Protection Program.

An alternative classification is maintained by West Point; in their &quot;Atlas of American Wars&quot; (Esposito, 1959), the siege of Petersburg ends with the Union assault and breakthrough of April 2. The remainder of the war in Virginia is classified as &quot;Grant&#x27;s Pursuit of Lee to Appomattox Court House (3–9 April 1865)&quot;. Trudeau&#x27;s &quot;Last Citadel&quot; conforms to this classification.

==Battlefield preservation==
The various historic sites and battlegrounds related to the siege of Petersburg are spread out across a vast area in the Petersburg vicinity. These sites and battlefields are primarily preserved by the National Park Service as the Petersburg National Battlefield, which features 13 separate sites on a 33-mile driving tour. The park&#x27;s primary sections are the City Point Unit, where Grant had his headquarters; the Eastern Front battlefield, which features the Crater and the main visitor center; the Five Forks battlefield and the Poplar Grove National Cemetery. The siege-ending &quot;Breakthrough&quot; battlefield is preserved as Pamplin Historical Park, a privately owned park open to the public. In addition, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved more than of battlefield land in five transactions since 2005, including a 33-acre parcel where Hill was killed on April 2, 1865.

<text>A scar (or scar tissue) is an area of fibrous tissue that replaces normal skin after an injury. Scars result from the biological process of wound repair in the skin, as well as in other organs, and tissues of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the healing process. With the exception of very minor lesions, every wound (e.g., after accident, disease, or surgery) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this are animals with complete regeneration, which regrow tissue without scar formation.

Scar tissue is composed of the same protein (collagen) as the tissue that it replaces, but the fiber composition of the protein is different; instead of a random basketweave formation of the collagen fibers found in normal tissue, in fibrosis the collagen cross-links and forms a pronounced alignment in a single direction. This collagen scar tissue alignment is usually of inferior functional quality to the normal collagen randomised alignment. For example, scars in the skin are less resistant to ultraviolet radiation, and sweat glands and hair follicles do not grow back within scar tissues. A myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, causes scar formation in the heart muscle, which leads to loss of muscular power and possibly heart failure. However, there are some tissues (e.g. bone) that can heal without any structural or functional deterioration.
== Types ==

All scarring is composed of the same collagen as the tissue it has replaced, but the composition of the scar tissue, compared to the normal tissue, is different. Scar tissue also lacks elasticity unlike normal tissue which distributes fiber elasticity. Scars differ in the amounts of collagen overexpressed. Labels have been applied to the differences in overexpression. Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and keloid scarring, both of which experience excessive stiff collagen bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an overexpression of collagen blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the collagen bundles do not overextend the tissue. Stretch marks (striae) are regarded as scars by some.

High melanin levels and either African or Asian ancestry may make adverse scarring more noticeable.

=== Hypertrophic ===

Hypertrophic scars occur when the body overproduces collagen, which causes the scar to be raised above the surrounding skin. Hypertrophic scars take the form of a red raised lump on the skin for lighter pigmented skin and the form of dark brown for darker pigmented skin. They usually occur within 4 to 8 weeks following wound infection or wound closure with excess tension and/or other traumatic skin injuries.

===Keloid===

Keloid scars are a more serious form of excessive scarring, because they can grow indefinitely into large, tumorous (although benign) neoplasms.

Hypertrophic scars are often distinguished from keloid scars by their lack of growth outside the original wound area, but this commonly taught distinction can lead to confusion.

Keloid scars can occur on anyone, but they are most common in dark-skinned people. They can be caused by surgery, cuts, accident, acne or, sometimes, body piercings. In some people, keloid scars form spontaneously. Although they can be a cosmetic problem, keloid scars are only inert masses of collagen and therefore completely harmless and not cancerous. However, they can be itchy or painful in some individuals. They tend to be most common on the shoulders and chest. Hypertrophic scars and keloids tend to be more common in wounds closed by secondary intention. Surgical removal of keloid is risky and may exacerbate the condition and worsening of the keloid.

=== Atrophic ===

An atrophic scar takes the form of a sunken recess in the skin, which has a pitted appearance. These are caused when underlying structures supporting the skin, such as fat or muscle, are lost. This type of scarring is often associated with acne, chickenpox, other diseases (especially &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; infection), surgery, certain insect and spider bites, or accidents. It can also be caused by a genetic connective tissue disorder, such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.

=== Stretch marks ===

Stretch marks (technically called &quot;striae&quot;) are also a form of scarring. These are caused when the skin is stretched rapidly (for instance during pregnancy, significant weight gain, or adolescent growth spurts), or when skin is put under tension during the healing process (usually near joints). This type of scar usually improves in appearance after a few years.

Elevated corticosteroid levels are implicated in striae development.

=== Umbilical ===
Humans and other placental mammals have an umbilical scar (commonly referred to as a navel) which starts to heal when the umbilical cord is cut after birth. Egg-laying animals have an umbilical scar which, depending on the species, may remain visible for life or disappear within a few days after birth.

== Pathophysiology ==
A scar is the product of the body&#x27;s repair mechanism after tissue injury. If a wound heals quickly within two weeks with new formation of skin, minimal collagen will be deposited and no scar will form. When the extracellular matrix senses elevated mechanical stress loading, tissue will scar, and scars can be limited by stress shielding wounds. Small full thickness wounds under 2mm reepithelize fast and heal scar free. Deep second-degree burns heal with scarring and hair loss. Sweat glands do not form in scar tissue, which impairs the regulation of body temperature. Elastic fibers are generally not detected in scar tissue younger than 3 months old. In scars, rete pegs are lost; through a lack of rete pegs, scars tend to shear easier than normal tissue.

The endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus, is the only adult tissue to undergo rapid cyclic shedding and regeneration without scarring, shedding and restoring roughly inside a 7-day window on a monthly basis. All other adult tissues, upon rapid shedding or injury, can scar.

Prolonged inflammation, as well as the fibroblast proliferation, can occur. Redness that often follows an injury to the skin is not a scar and is generally not permanent (see wound healing). The time it takes for this redness to dissipate may, however, range from a few days to, in some serious and rare cases, a few years.

Scars form differently based on the location of the injury on the body and the age of the person who was injured.

The worse the initial damage is, the worse the scar will generally be. 

Skin scars occur when the dermis (the deep, thick layer of skin) is damaged. Most skin scars are flat and leave a trace of the original injury that caused them.

Wounds allowed to heal secondarily tend to scar worse than wounds from primary closure.

===Collagen synthesis===
An injury does not become a scar until the wound has completely healed; this can take many months, or years in the worst pathological cases, such as keloids. To begin to patch the damage, a clot is created; this clot is the beginning process that results in a provisional matrix. In the process, the first layer is a provisional matrix and is not a scar. Over time, the wounded body tissue overexpresses collagen inside the provisional matrix to create a collagen matrix. This collagen overexpression continues and crosslinks the fiber arrangement inside the collagen matrix, making the collagen dense. This densely packed collagen, morphing into an inelastic whitish collagen scar wall, blocks off cell communication and regeneration; as a result, the new tissue generated will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding unwounded tissue. This prolonged collagen-producing process results in a fortuna scar.

====Fibroblasts====
The scarring is created by fibroblast proliferation, a process that begins with a reaction to the clot. To mend the damage, fibroblasts slowly form the collagen scar. The fibroblast proliferation is circular and cyclically, the fibroblast proliferation lays down thick, whitish collagen inside the provisional and collagen matrix, resulting in the abundant production of packed collagen on the fibers giving scars their uneven texture. Over time, the fibroblasts continue to crawl around the matrix, adjusting more fibers and, in the process, the scarring settles and becomes stiff. This fibroblast proliferation also contracts the tissue. In unwounded tissue, these fibers are not overexpressed with thick collagen and do not contract.

EPF and ENF fibroblasts have been genetically traced with the Engrailed-1 genetic marker. EPFs are the primary contributors to all fibrotic outcomes after wounding. ENFs do not contribute to fibrotic outcomes.

====Myofibroblast====
Mammalian wounds that involve the dermis of the skin heal by repair, not regeneration (except in 1st trimester inter-uterine wounds and in the regeneration of deer antlers). Full-thickness wounds heal by a combination of wound contracture and edge re-epitheliasation. Partial thickness wounds heal by edge re-epithelialisation and epidermal migration from adnexal structures (hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands). The site of keratinocyte stem cells remains unknown but stem cells are likely to reside in the basal layer of the epidermis and below the bulge area of hair follicles.

The fibroblast involved in scarring and contraction is the myofibroblast, which is a specialized contractile fibroblast. These cells express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). 
The myofibroblasts are absent in the first trimester in the embryonic stage where damage heals scar-free; in small incisional or excision wounds less than 2 mm that also heal without scarring; and in adult unwounded tissues where the fibroblast in itself is arrested; however, the myofibroblast is found in massive numbers in adult wound healing which heals with a scar.

The myofibroblasts make up a high proportion of the fibroblasts proliferating in the postembryonic wound at the onset of healing. In the rat model, for instance, myofibroblasts can constitute up to 70% of the fibroblasts, and is responsible for fibrosis on tissue. Generally, the myofibroblasts disappear from the wound within 30 days, but can remain in pathological cases in hypertrophy, such as keloids. Myofibroblasts have plasticity and in mice can be transformed into fat cells, instead of scar tissue, via the regeneration of hair follicles.

==Mechanical stress==
Wounds under 2mm generally do not scar but larger wounds generally do scar. In 2011 it was found that mechanical stress can stimulate scarring and that stress shielding can reduce scarring in wounds. In 2021 it was found that using chemicals to manipulate fibroblasts to not sense mechanical stress brought scar-free healing. The scar-free healing also occurred when mechanical stress was placed onto a wound.

== Treatment ==
Early and effective treatment of acne scarring can prevent severe acne and the scarring that often follows. In 2004, no prescription drugs for the treatment or prevention of scars were available.

=== Chemical peels ===
Chemical peels are chemicals which destroy the epidermis in a controlled manner, leading to exfoliation and the alleviation of certain skin conditions, including superficial acne scars. Various chemicals can be used depending upon the depth of the peel, and caution should be used, particularly for dark-skinned individuals and those individuals susceptible to keloid formation or with active infections.

=== Filler injections ===
Filler injections of collagen can be used to raise atrophic scars to the level of surrounding skin. Risks vary based upon the filler used, and can include further disfigurement and allergic reaction.

=== Laser treatment ===
Nonablative lasers, such as the 585 nm pulsed dye laser, 1064 nm and 1320 nm , or the 1540 nm are used as laser therapy for hypertrophic scars and keloids. There is tentative evidence for burn scars that they improve the appearance.

Ablative lasers such as the carbon dioxide laser (CO) or offer the best results for atrophic and acne scars. Like dermabrasion, ablative lasers work by removing the epidermis. Healing times for ablative therapy are much longer and the risk profile is greater compared to nonablative therapy; however, nonablative therapy offers only minor improvements in cosmetic appearance of atrophic and acne scars.

=== Radiotherapy ===
Low-dose, superficial radiotherapy is sometimes used to prevent recurrence of severe keloid and hypertrophic scarring. It is thought to be effective despite a lack of clinical trials, but only used in extreme cases due to the perceived risk of long-term side effects.

=== Dressings and topical silicone===
Silicone scar treatments are commonly used in preventing scar formation and improving existing scar appearance. A meta-study by the Cochrane collaboration found weak evidence that silicone gel sheeting helps prevent scarring. However, the studies examining it were of poor quality and susceptible to bias.

Pressure dressings are commonly used in managing burn and hypertrophic scars, although supporting evidence is lacking. Care providers commonly report improvements, however, and pressure therapy has been effective in treating ear keloids. The general acceptance of the treatment as effective may prevent it from being further studied in clinical trials.

=== Verapamil-containing silicone gel ===
Verapamil, a type of calcium channel blocker, is considered a candidate drug for the treatment of hypertrophic scars. A study conducted by the Catholic University of Korea concluded that verapamil-releasing silicone gel is effective and is a superior alternative to the conventional silicone gel where decreased median SEI, fibroblast count, and collagen density in all verapamil-added treatment groups were observed. Gross morphologic features suggested that the combination of verapamil and silicone improves the overall quality of hypertrophic scars by reducing scar height and redness. This was verified with quantifiable histomorphometric parameters; however, oral verapamil is not a good choice because of its effect of lowering blood pressure. Intralesional injection of verapamil is also suboptimal because of the required frequency for injections. Topical silicone gel combined with verapamil does not lead to systemic hypotension, is convenient to apply, and shows enhanced results.

=== Steroids ===
A long-term course of corticosteroid injections into the scar may help flatten and soften the appearance of keloid or hypertrophic scars.

Topical steroids are ineffective. However, clobetasol propionate can be used as an alternative treatment for keloid scars.

Topical steroid applied immediately after fractionated laser treatment is however very effective (and more efficacious than laser treatment alone) and has shown benefit in numerous clinical studies.

=== Surgery ===
Scar revision is a process of cutting the scar tissue out. After the excision, the new wound is usually closed up to heal by primary intention, instead of secondary intention. Deeper cuts need a multilayered closure to heal optimally, otherwise depressed or dented scars can result.

Surgical excision of hypertrophic or keloid scars is often associated to other methods, such as pressotherapy or silicone gel sheeting. Lone excision of keloid scars, however, shows a recurrence rate close to 45%. A clinical study is currently ongoing to assess the benefits of a treatment combining surgery and laser-assisted healing in hypertrophic or keloid scars.

&quot;Subcision&quot; is a process used to treat deep rolling scars left behind by acne or other skin diseases. It is also used to lessen the appearance of severe glabella lines, though its effectiveness in this application is debatable. Essentially the process involves separating the skin tissue in the affected area from the deeper scar tissue. This allows the blood to pool under the affected area, eventually causing the deep rolling scar to level off with the rest of the skin area. Once the skin has leveled, treatments such as laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion or chemical peels can be used to smooth out the scarred tissue.

===Vitamins===
Research shows the use of vitamin E and onion extract (sold as Mederma) as treatments for scars is ineffective. Vitamin E causes contact dermatitis in up to 33% of users and in some cases it may worsen scar appearance and could cause minor skin irritations, but Vitamin C and some of its esters fade the dark pigment associated with some scars.

===Other===
* Cosmetics; Medical makeup can temporarily conceal scars. This is most commonly used for facial scars.
* Dermabrasion involves the removal of the surface of the skin with special equipment, and usually involves a local anaesthetic.
* A 2012 literature review found weak evidence that massage was efficacious in scar management. Any beneficial effect appeared to be greater in wounds created by surgical incision than for traumatic or burn wounds. A 2022 scoping review covering twenty-five studies of 1515 participants reported that all studies reviewed reported favorable outcomes for scar massage, but that &quot;while there may be benefits to scar massage in reducing pain, increasing movement and improving scar characteristics&quot;, there was a lack of &quot;consistent research methods, intervention protocols and outcome measures&quot;.
* Microneedling

==Society and culture==

=== Intentional scarring ===
The permanence of scarring has led to its intentional use as a form of body art within some cultures and subcultures. These forms of ritual and non-ritual scarring practices can be found in many groups and cultures around the world.

===Etymology===
First attested in English in the late 14th century, the word &quot;scar&quot; derives from a conflation of Old French &quot;escharre&quot;, from Late Latin &quot;eschara&quot;, which is the Latinisation of the Greek ἐσχάρα (&quot;eskhara&quot;), meaning &quot;hearth, fireplace&quot;, but in medicine &quot;scab, eschar on a wound caused by burning or otherwise&quot;, and Middle English &quot;skar&quot; (&quot;cut, crack, incision&quot;), which is from Old Norse &quot;skarð&quot; (&quot;notch, gap&quot;). The conflation helped to form the English meaning. Compare the place name Scarborough for evolution of &quot;skarð&quot; to &quot;scar&quot;.

==Research==

Research, before 2009, focused on scar improvements with research into molecular mechanisms. Treatments involving molecular mechanisms including avotermin, ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK), and osteopontin were investigated at the time. After successful phase I/II trials, human recombinant TGF-β3 (avotermin, planned trade name Juvista) failed in Phase III trials.
In 2011, the scientific literature highlighted stress shielding a fresh wound through the wound healing process, brings significant scar improvement and smaller scars.

By 2016, skin had been regenerated &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot;. and scar-free healing had been operationalized and induced by four main regeneration techniques: by instrument, by materials, by drugs, and by &quot;in vitro&quot; 3-D printing. In 2018, a silk-derived sericin hydrogel dressing was undergoing research, the material was shown to prevent scar formation. By 2021, more people were paying attention to the possibility of scar revision and new technologies.

In 2021, researchers found that, verteporfin, an FDA-approved drug for eye disease, could enable scar-free healing in mice. According to the study, the drug works by blocking mechanical stress signals in fibroblast cells.

<text>Hopewell is an independent city surrounded by Prince George County and the Appomattox River in the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 23,033. The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines the city of Hopewell with Prince George County for statistical purposes.

Hopewell is in the Tri-Cities area of the Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).

==History==
=== City Point ===

The city was founded to take advantage of its site overlooking the James and Appomattox Rivers. City Point, the oldest part of Hopewell, was established in 1613 by Sir Thomas Dale. It was first known as &quot;Bermuda City&quot;. (At this time, Bermuda, the Atlantic archipelago, was considered part of the Colony of Virginia and appeared on its maps.) The name soon changed to Charles City. In 1619 Samuel Sharpe and Samuel Jordan from were burgesses from Charles City at the first meeting of the House of Burgesses. &quot;Charles City Point&quot; was in Charles City Shire when the first eight shires were established in the Colony of Virginia in 1634. Charles City Shire soon became known as Charles City County in 1643. 
The burgesses separated an area of the county south of the river, including City Point, establishing it separately as Prince George County in 1703. 

During the American Civil War, Union General Ulysses S. Grant used City Point as his headquarters during the Siege of Petersburg in 1864 and 1865. Grant&#x27;s headquarters, which President Lincoln visited, were located at Appomattox Manor, one of the three plantations of Richard Eppes, who cultivated wheat and other grains and held 130 slaves at the beginning of the war.

His property included most of the present-day city of Hopewell and Eppes Island, a plantation across the James River from City Point. Richard Slaughter, a former slave of Eppes, escaped to a Union ship during the Civil War, as did all but 12 of Eppes&#x27; 130 slaves, choosing freedom. Slaughter recounted his life story for a Works Progress Administration interviewer in 1936.

The City Point Railroad, built in 1838 between City Point and Petersburg, was used as a critical part of the siege strategy. It is considered the oldest portion of the Norfolk and Western Railway, now a part of Norfolk Southern.

City Point was an unincorporated town in Prince George County until the City of Hopewell annexed the Town of City Point in 1923. Despite the evolving name, Hopewell/City Point is the second oldest continuously inhabited English settlement in the United States after Hampton. Jamestown no longer is inhabited.

===Hopewell Farm===
Hopewell, part of the Eppes&#x27; plantation, was developed by DuPont Company in 1914 as Hopewell Farm, an incorporated area in Prince George County. DuPont first built a dynamite factory there, then switched to the manufacture of guncotton during World War I.

Nearly burned to the ground in the Hopewell Fire of 1915, the city prospered afterward and became known as the &quot;Wonder City&quot; as the village of Hopewell grew from a hamlet of 400 in 1916 to a city of more than 20,000 people in a few short months. Unlike most cities in Virginia, Hopewell was never incorporated as a town, but it was incorporated as an independent city in 1916.

After DuPont abandoned the city following World War I, moving its manufacturing facilities elsewhere and specializing in other products, Hopewell briefly became a ghost town until 1923 when Tubize Corporation established a plant on the old DuPont site. The same year, the city of Hopewell annexed the neighboring town of City Point, which enabled it to expand and thrive. The Tubize plant was later acquired by Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and was a major employer in Hopewell for decades. Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation and Hercules Chemical also established plants on portions of the old DuPont site.

===20th century populace===
As early as its incorporation, Hopewell was a city of industrious migrants. Immigrants from Bohemia (now the western lands of the Czech Republic), Italy, and Greece populated the city, working in factories and opening small businesses. Others migrated from other parts of Virginia and neighboring states of North Carolina and West Virginia to work in Hopewell&#x27;s industries.

As was the case in most southern cities, African Americans in Hopewell were subject to Jim Crow segregation until the success of the Civil Rights Movement. The picturesque theater in the middle of town, the Beacon Theatre, only allowed Blacks in the balcony. In August 1966, the Ku Klux Klan confronted the Reverend Curtis Harris and other Black Hopewell citizens when they attempted to petition the city manager to find an alternate location for a landfill that was going to be opened in the middle of a Black neighborhood. Hopewell public schools were desegregated under court order in 1963, following &quot;Renee Patrice GILLIAM et al v. School Board of the City of Hopewell, Virginia.&quot;

===1935 bus tragedy===
Hopewell made national news when, on December 22, 1935, a bus plunged through the open draw of the Appomattox River Drawbridge on State Route 10 just outside Hopewell&#x27;s city limits. Only one of the 15 occupants of the bus survived. The modern twin spans of the Charles Hardaway Marks Bridges were built to replace that bridge and cross the river nearby.

===Urban renewal===
Like many cities, Hopewell embarked on an urban renewal plan in the 1960s in an attempt to revitalize its downtown retail area. The plan was a failure because many of the retail businesses that had been located downtown moved elsewhere to new shopping centers being developed outside the city limits in Petersburg, Chester, and Prince George County. With the exception of a new branch bank and a Hardee&#x27;s fast food restaurant constructed in the late 1970s, the former downtown area that was razed for redevelopment remained a vast gravel parking lot for decades.

However, a new urbanization is occurring, and many long vacant storefronts are now refurbished and occupied. Several others are now under construction. Further, the City invested $12 million in a new beautiful state of the art flagship library for the busy Appomattox Regional Library System, the Maude Langhorne Nelson Library. The library has a cyber cafe, extensive YA and children&#x27;s collections, and a replica of the historic, 1600s-era frigate ship, &quot;Hopewell&quot;, installed as a centerpiece. The city also restored the Beacon Theatre, which was built in 1928, and there are 70 or more concerts and other events annually. Performers there include The Temptations, The Four Tops, Vince Gill, Travis Tritt, Clint Black, Amy Grant, Average White Band, Vanilla Ice, The Commodores, Pure Prairie League, Delbert McClinton, and many more.

New plantings and street beautification projects have been put into place, to attract more businesses and shoppers to the East Broadway area.

===Toxic waste dumping ground===
Hopewell is located at the confluence of the Appomattox and James rivers. The James River has suffered from serious water pollution problems attributable to chemical dumping; Kepone insecticide (manufactured in Hopewell from 1966–1975) was dumped in the river by the pesticide&#x27;s manufacturer Allied Signal and subcontractor LifeSciences Product Company. The LifeSciences facility in Hopewell was the world&#x27;s only manufacturer of Kepone, producing up to 6,000 pounds daily. Although closely related to the toxic pesticide DDT, which was banned in the U.S. in 1972 because of the dangers it presents to humans and wildlife, Kepone was not federally regulated until after the Hopewell disaster, in which 29 factory workers were hospitalized with various ailments. In 1975, the state health department shut down the facility, and fishing in the James River from Richmond to the Chesapeake Bay was banned due to contamination concerns.

Kepone is cited amongst a handful of other noxious substances as the driver for Gerald Ford&#x27;s half-hearted approval of the Toxic Substances Control Act, which &quot;remains one of the most controversial regulatory bills ever passed&quot;. Since the discovery of the Kepone disaster in 1975, the water quality has improved, and the fishing ban was lifted after 13 years. In 2019, after years of planning, the city opened a &quot;Riverwalk&quot; boardwalk, seeking to use scenic views and water access as part of overall economic redevelopment efforts. Bass and catfish are now routinely fished at a Hopewell marina.

Hopewell is the location of several large chemical plants owned by the Honeywell Corporation, Ashland, Evonik Industries, as well as a Green Plains Inc. ethanol plant and paper mill owned by WestRock.

===Recent history===
The Federal Correctional Complex, Petersburg (FCC Petersburg), two federal prisons which house 3400 inmates, are located just outside the Hopewell city limits, in Prince George County

In 1977, Hopewell again made the national news due to another accident involving a drawbridge when the tanker S.S. Marine Floridian outbound under the command of a James River pilot suffered a steering malfunction just after dawn on February 24 that caused it to veer out of the channel and hit the Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge just east of town. The accident caused serious damage to the bridge and it was closed for months.

In 1983, Hopewell again received negative publicity from the national news media when it was discovered that Evelyn Rust Wells, an elderly woman, had been held captive and terrorized in her home in the City Point section. Her captors, mostly male teenagers under 18, cashed her Social Security checks at local grocery stores. A local grocer noted a change in purchases from when neighborhood kids assisted Wells and called the police. They investigated and freed Wells who was by then severely malnourished.

Although still an important industrial city, Hopewell has struggled with transitions through loss of jobs due to plant closures, changes in residential housing patterns, and the costs of environmental clean-up. Much of its middle-class population moved to neighboring Prince George and Chesterfield Counties for newer housing during the suburban expansion of the 1960s and 1970s. The city&#x27;s housing stock is dominated by relatively small homes with a significant percentage being offered as rental properties. Of these, many were hastily constructed over a century ago by DuPont to house plant workers during the First World War.

Hopewell has encouraged re-development along its waterfront areas along the James and Appomattox Rivers, in the downtown area, and the City Point Historic District, as well as the sites of several long vacant industrial plants. Due to its hasty construction as a mill town during the First World War, Hopewell had a large number of kit homes that were hauled in and erected in neighborhoods laid out by DuPont known as &quot;A Village&quot; and &quot;B Village&quot;. The city has a surviving group of Sears Catalog Homes, with several available for exterior viewing on a self-guided tour. The city also has numerous Aladdin Kit Homes; at one time, it may have had the most such homes in the nation. Because residents moved to newer houses and the Aladdin Homes were abandoned and deteriorated, many have been razed. 

Hopewell has struggled with high rates of violent crime.
In September 2010, a series of explosions occurred at a controversial new ethanol plant that had recently been constructed on a long vacant site formerly occupied by a Firestone plant. In 2007, former Hopewell mayor and civil rights leader Curtis W. Harris, had marched against the proposed ethanol plant being built in Hopewell with support from the national Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The plant had not yet become fully operational when the explosions occurred. There was no loss of life due to the accident but shortly after the explosion Osage BioEnergy, the owners of the $150 million facility, announced that the plant was for sale. Although the facility was sitting idle through 2013 with the city of Hopewell taking legal action to recoup unpaid taxes on the property, the facility was eventually purchased by another firm and operations were restarted in 2014. In 2015 the troubled ethanol plant closed again for a second time after less than a year in operation with its owners citing a lack of profitability as the reason for the shutdown. The plant has since been purchased and re-opened by Green Plains Inc. of Omaha, Nebraska.

Hopewell has come to the attention of AAA because some of its members have complained that Hopewell is a speed trap for its practice of citing drivers for speeding along a 1.7 mile stretch of Interstate 295, nicknamed the &quot;Million Dollar Mile&quot; by disgruntled drivers. AAA, claimed in a press release that Hopewell employs 11 sheriff&#x27;s deputies working in 14-hour shifts to patrol less than two miles of the highway that lie within the city limits of Hopewell. However, this statistic has been denied by the sheriff of Hopewell, who was baffled as to where that information was generated as he said the deputies working on I-295 only work eight-hour shifts. This practice, which it has been claimed, annually generated $1.8 million in revenue from speeding tickets, of which 75% were issued to out of state drivers, triggered a court clash between the Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney and the city prosecutor, and elicited an official ruling from the Attorney General of Virginia. Sheriff Luther Sodat said that the almost two-mile stretch of highway &quot;is a safety issue for Hopewell.&quot; Virginia&#x27;s urban interstates have a fatality rate about one-third the Statewide rate for all roads combined.

<text>Bering Island () is located off the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Bering Sea.

==Description==
At long by wide, it is the largest and westernmost of the Commander Islands, with an area of . Most of Bering Island and several of the smaller islands in their entirety are now part of the Komandorsky Zapovednik nature preserve.

Bering Island is treeless, desolate and experiences severe weather, including high winds, persistent fog and earthquakes. It had no year-round human residents until roughly 1826. Now, the village of Nikolskoye is home to 800 people, roughly three hundred of them identifying as Aleuts. The island&#x27;s small population is involved mostly in fishing.

 off Bering Island&#x27;s western shore lies small Toporkov Island (Ostrov Toporkov) . It is a round island with a diameter of .

==History==
In 1741 Commander Vitus Bering, sailing in &quot;Svyatoy Pyotr&quot; (&quot;St. Peter&quot;) for the Russian Navy, was shipwrecked and died of scurvy on Bering Island, along with 28 of his men. His ship had been destroyed by storms as they returned from an expedition that discovered mainland Alaska as well as the Aleutian Islands for Russians. The survivors under the command of the Swedish born lieutenant were stranded on the island for 10 months, and managed to survive by killing seals and birds. They were able to build a boat out of their stranded wreck and managed to return to Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula in 1742 with sea otter furs and preserved meat from the newly discovered island.

Another of the expedition&#x27;s survivors was Georg Wilhelm Steller, who eventually managed to convince his companions to eat seaweed (thus curing their scurvy). Steller explored Bering Island and cataloged its fauna, including Steller&#x27;s sea cow, which became extinct within three decades due to being hunted for its meat. The island&#x27;s highest point () is now named to honor the German-born naturalist. Upon returning to the Russian mainland, Steller then explored the Kamchatka peninsula and ultimately published &quot;De Bestiis Marinis&quot; (‘On the Beasts of the Sea’). However, his sympathies for the native peoples led to accusations that he was fomenting rebellion, so he was imprisoned and recalled to St. Petersburg, dying en route at age 37, although his diaries were later published to great acclaim and historic significance.

In 1743 Emilian Basov landed on Bering Island to hunt sea otter, beginning the island&#x27;s documented human habitation as well as ecological destruction. Promyshlenniki began to island-hop across the Bering Sea to the Aleutian islands and ultimately Alaska. In 1825 the Russian-American Company transferred Aleut families from Attu Island to Bering Island to hunt, and another group of Aleut and mixed-race settlers followed the following year, thus establishing the first known permanent human habitation on Bering Island. After Russia sold Alaska and the Aleutian islands to the United States in 1867, Bering Island was placed under the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky jurisdiction. The population grew from 110 people in 1827 (17 Russians, 45 Aleuts and 48 mixed race) to more than 300 people in 1879 (100 Aleuts on Copper island alone, along with 332 mixed-race and about 10% Russian or other nationalities). In 1990, after 170 years of separation and loss of cultural traditions, a planeload of Aleuts from Nikolskoye met another planeload of Alaskan Aleuts in Kamchatka&#x27;s capital, and were surprised they could still communicate in the old Aleut language. Because of their isolation, like the now-Alaskan Pribilof Islands, the Aleuts have been used for studies of genetic drift.

==Nature==
The area surrounding Bering Island is now a biosphere reserve, known for its diverse wildlife, and particularly marine mammals. The island&#x27;s shores form a natural habitat for sea otters, and their population now appears stable, unlike on other Aleutian islands, and although they had been hunted to near extinction on the then-recently discovered Bering Island by 1854. Steller sea lions continue to summer on Bering Island, but the manatee-like Steller&#x27;s sea cows, which fed on the kelp beds surrounding the island, were hunted to extinction by 1768. 

Bering Island has also long been famous for its seal rookeries, including northern fur seals, common seals and larga seals, although that population dropped to but 2 rookeries totaling 3,000 seals by 1913 (two years after the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911), particularly after the 20 year hunting lease of Hutchinson, Kohl and Company of San Francisco, which removed over 800,000 pelts.

Whale species sighted in the surrounding waters include sperm whales, orcas, several species of beaked whales, humpback, and right whales. Porpoises also frequent these waters.

Bering Island also has numerous seabirds. UNESCO noted that 203 bird species have been sighted on the Commander Islands, including 58 nesting there. Puffins are abundant, although the semi-flightless spectacled cormorant became extinct circa 1850. Two species of the Arctic foxes that tormented Bering&#x27;s crew remain. Humans introduced reindeer, American mink and rats to the islands, with negative effects on native wildlife.

==Climate==
Like the rest of Kamchatka Krai, Bering Island has a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;), though the ocean makes temperatures much less extreme than interior Siberia, with winters being about four degrees milder than in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The transition to the subpolar oceanic climate of southwest Alaska to the east is very apparent, especially in the extremely low sunshine hours, which average only around 2.8 h per day due to the consistent fog from the Aleutian Low and the Oyashio Current on its western flank.
Extreme temperatures have ranged from , with the latter occurring as recently as July 11, 2022.

<doc id="77672" wikidata="Q669749" url="?curid=77672" title="The Song of Bernadette (film)">
<text>The Song of Bernadette is a 1943 American biographical drama film based on the 1941 novel of the same name by Franz Werfel. It stars Jennifer Jones in the title role, which portrays the story of Bernadette Soubirous, who reportedly experienced eighteen visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary from February to July 1858 and was canonized in 1933. The film was directed by Henry King, from a screenplay by George Seaton.

The novel was extremely popular, spending more than a year on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and thirteen weeks heading the list. The story was also turned into a Broadway play, which opened at the Belasco Theatre in March 1946.

== Plot ==
In 1858, 14-year-old Bernadette Soubirous lives in poverty with her family in Lourdes, France. She is shamed by her Catholic school teacher, Sister Vauzou for falling behind in her studies because of her asthma. That afternoon, while fetching firewood with her sister Marie and a friend, Bernadette waits for them in the Massabielle grotto. Distracted by a strange breeze and a change in the light, Bernadette sees a beautiful lady clad in white, standing on a rock niche. Bernadette tells her companions what she saw, and they promise not to tell anyone else. However, Marie tells their mother when they return home, and the story soon spreads all over Lourdes.

Many, including Bernadette&#x27;s Aunt Bernarde, are convinced of her sincerity, standing up for her against her disbelieving parents. Bernadette, continues to repeatedly visit the grotto as requested by the lady, accompanied by other citizens of Lourdes. While Abbé Dominique Peyramale refuses to get involved; civil authorities threateningly interrogate Bernadette, but she confounds them with her simplicity and stands behind her story. On one visit, the lady asks Bernadette to drink and wash at a seemingly nonexistent spring. Bernadette obediently digs a hole in the ground and smears her face with dirt. Though she is initially ridiculed, water later begins to flow, which exhibits miraculous healing properties; and ailing people soon begin flocking to Lourdes.

On Bernadette’s last visit to the grotto, the lady finally identifies herself as the &quot;Immaculate Conception.&quot; When civil authorities try to have Bernadette declared insane, Peyramale, who once doubted her, now becomes her staunchest ally and asks for a formal church investigation to verify if Bernadette is a fraud, insane, or genuine.

The grotto is fenced off, and the Bishop of Tarbes declares that unless the Emperor orders the grotto to open, there will be no investigation. When The Emperor’s infant son is cured of his illness by water from Lourdes, the Empress demands that the grotto be reopened. The Bishop of Tarbes then directs the commission to convene. The investigation takes many years, and Bernadette is questioned again and again, but the commission eventually determines that Bernadette truly experienced the visions and was visited by the Virgin Mary.

Believing it unsuitable for her to live an ordinary life, Peyramale persuades Bernadette to join the Sisters of Charity of Nevers. Bernadette undergoes rigorous spiritual training and works hard at the convent but is also subjected to emotional abuse from Sister Vauzou, now mistress of novices at the convent. Vauzou tells Bernadette that doubt consumes her, and that she cannot believe that Bernadette, who has never suffered, would be chosen by God when she has spent her life suffering in his service. 
Though Bernadette agrees that she has not suffered, she then reveals a tumor hidden under the skirt of her habit, much to Vauzou’s horror. The doctor diagnoses tuberculosis of the bone; the condition causes unspeakable pain, yet Bernadette had never mentioned it. Vauzou, realizing her error, prays for forgiveness and vows to serve Bernadette for the rest of her life. Despite the severity of her illness, Bernadette refuses to partake of the grotto’s healing waters.

On her deathbed, Bernadette sends for Peyramale and confesses her feelings of unworthiness while sorrowfully maintaining that she may never see the lady again. However, the lady appears in the room, smiles, and gestures to Bernadette warmly. Bernadette joyfully cries out to the apparition before finally dying. Upon her death, Peyramale remarks, &quot;You are now in Heaven and on earth. Your life begins, O Bernadette.&quot;

==Historical accuracy==
The film&#x27;s plot follows the novel by Franz Werfel, which is not a documentary but a historical novel blending fact and fiction. Bernadette&#x27;s real-life friend Antoine Nicolau is portrayed as being deeply in love with her and vowing to remain unmarried when Bernadette enters the convent. No such relationship is documented as existing between them. In addition, the government authorities, in particular, Imperial Prosecutor Vital Dutour (played by Vincent Price) are portrayed as being much more anti-religion than they actually were; in fact, Dutour was himself a devout Catholic who simply thought Bernadette was hallucinating. Other portrayals come closer to historical accuracy, particularly Anne Revere and Roman Bohnen as Bernadette&#x27;s overworked parents, Charles Bickford as Father Peyramale (although his presence at Bernadette&#x27;s deathbed was an artistic embellishment; in reality, Peyramale had died a few years before Bernadette), and Blanche Yurka as formidable Aunt Bernarde.

The portrayal of Sister Marie Therese Vauzou is also inaccurate. There is no evidence that Sister Vazou was Bernadette’s elementary school teacher or that they met prior to the time that Bernanette entered the convent.

The film combines the characters of Vital Dutour and the man of letters Hyacinthe de La Fite, who appears in the novel and believes he has cancer of the larynx. La Fite does not appear at all in the movie. In the film, it is Dutour who is dying of cancer of the larynx at the end, and who goes to the Lourdes shrine, kneels at the gates to the grotto and says, &quot;Pray for me, Bernadette.&quot;

The film ends with the death of Bernadette and does not mention the exhumation of her body or her canonization, as the novel does.

==Music==
Igor Stravinsky was initially informally approached to write the film score. On February 15, 1943, he started writing music for the &quot;Apparition of the Virgin&quot; scene. However, the studio never approved a contract with Stravinsky, and the project went to Alfred Newman, who won an Oscar. The music Stravinsky had written for the film made its way into the second movement of his Symphony in Three Movements.

==Reception==
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the movie a mostly negative review, praising the acting, especially Jones&#x27;s, but regretting the movie&#x27;s &quot;tedious and repetitious&quot; narrative, its emphasis on &quot;images that lack visual mobility&quot; and &quot;dialectic discourse that will clutter and fatigue the average mind,&quot; and the decision to make Bernadette&#x27;s &quot;lady&quot; visible to viewers.

==Awards and nominations==
==Radio adaptation==
&quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; was presented on &quot;Hollywood Star Time&quot; April 21, 1946. The 30-minute adaptation starred Vincent Price, Lee J. Cobb, Pedro DeCordoba, and Vanessa Brown.

<text>Watch on the Rhine is a 1943 American drama film directed by Herman Shumlin and starring Bette Davis and Paul Lukas. The screenplay by Dashiell Hammett is based on the 1941 play &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; by Lillian Hellman. &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Paul Lukas won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Kurt Muller, a German-born anti-fascist in this film.

==Plot==
In 1940, German engineer Kurt Muller, his American wife Sara, and their children Joshua, Babette, and Bodo cross the Mexican border into the United States to visit Sara&#x27;s brother David Farrelly and their mother Fanny in Washington, D.C. For the past 17 years, the Muller family has lived in Europe, where Kurt responded to the rise of Nazism by engaging in anti-fascist activities. Sara tells her family they are seeking peaceful sanctuary on American soil, but their quest is threatened by the presence of house guest Teck de Brancovis, an opportunistic Romanian count who has been conspiring with the German Embassy. Teck, married to the younger Marthe, tries to force her to learn more about the Mullers. She and David are attracted to each other and she finds her husband&#x27;s politics horrendous.

Teck searches the Mullers&#x27; room and discovers a gun and money intended to finance underground operations in Germany. Shortly after, the Mullers learn that resistance worker Max Freidank has been arrested. Because Max once rescued Kurt from the Gestapo, Kurt plans to return to Germany to assist him and those arrested with him. Aware that Kurt will be in great danger if the Nazis discover he is returning to Germany, Teck demands $10,000 ($ today) to keep silent. After considerable bargaining, Kurt kills him, having concluded that Teck cannot be trusted. Realizing the dangers Kurt faces, Fanny and David agree to help him return.

Time passes, and when the Mullers fail to hear from Kurt, Joshua announces he plans to search for his father as soon as he turns 18. Although distraught by the possibility of losing her son as well as her husband, Sara resolves to be brave when the time comes for Joshua to leave.

==Cast==
==Production==
The Lillian Hellman play had enjoyed a respectable run of 378 performances on Broadway. Feeling its focus on patriotism would make it an ideal and prestigious propaganda film at the height of World War II, Jack L. Warner paid $150,000 for the screen rights in 1941. The play&#x27;s producer Herman Shumlin was hired as director, while many of the actors from the play reprised their role in the film.

Because Bette Davis was involved with &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;, producer Hal B. Wallis began searching for another actress for the role of Sara Muller while Hellman&#x27;s lover Dashiell Hammett began writing the screenplay at their farm in Pleasantville, New York. Irene Dunne liked the material but felt the role was too small, and Margaret Sullavan expressed no interest whatsoever. Edna Best, Rosemary DeCamp, and Helen Hayes also were considered.

For the role of Kurt Muller, Wallis wanted Charles Boyer. He, however, felt his French accent was wrong for the character, so the producer decided to cast Paul Lukas, who had originated the role on Broadway and had been honored by The Drama League for his performance.

Paul Henreid later said Jack Warner offered him the lead but turned it down because he did not want to be typecast, and felt that it was based on a &quot;contrived play, in no way up to Elmer Rice&#x27;s &quot;Flight to the West&quot;. My original contract stipulated that I always get the girl and I used that as an excuse to get out of the movie.&quot;

Meanwhile, Hammett was sidelined by an injured back, and by the time he was ready to resume work on the script, Davis was close to completing her work in &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;. Wallis sent Davis, a staunch supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and a fierce opponent of the Nazi Party, the screenplay-in-progress, and she immediately accepted the offer.

With Davis cast as Sara, Wallis encouraged Hammett to embellish what essentially was a secondary role to make it worthy of the leading lady&#x27;s status as a star, and to open the story by adding scenes outside the Farrelly living room, which had been the sole setting on stage.

The Production Code Administration was concerned that Kurt Muller escaped prosecution for his murder of Teck de Brancovis, and the Hays Office suggested it be established Kurt was killed by the Nazis at the end of the film in order to show he paid for his crime. Hellman objected, the studio agreed Kurt had been justified in shooting Teck, and the scene remained. In his afterword to the April 25, 2020 airing of &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; on TCM, Dave Karger describes this controversy in more detail. According to Karger&#x27;s script, Joe Breen demanded a new scene in which Muller suffered the consequences of his actions, but Lukas did not show up for the filming. The censor insisted that Muller could not be allowed to get away with murder, even of a Nazi, so the last scene of the film, between Sara and her son, Joshua, was added. Many months have passed without word from Muller, strongly suggesting that he has been captured and/or killed.

Filming began on June 9, 1942, and did not go smoothly. Beginning only a week after &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; had ended production, Davis was working without a substantial vacation and was on edge. As a result, she immediately clashed with Herman Shumlin, who had directed the play but had no experience in film, and she tended to ignore his suggestions.

Her emotional overacting prompted Wallis to send Shumlin numerous memos urging the director to tone down her performance. Shumlin threatened to quit because he was unhappy with cinematographer Merritt B. Gerstad, who eventually was replaced by Hal Mohr in order to appease the director. Meanwhile, Davis also was at odds with Lucile Watson who was reprising the role of the mother she had portrayed on stage, because Watson was a Republican whose political views sharply contrasted with those of the Democratic Davis. She and Lukas, however, got along quite well.

Several exterior scenes shot on location in Washington were cut from the film before its release due to wartime restrictions on the filming of government buildings. Other locations included the Warner Bros. Ranch in Burbank, Busch Gardens in Pasadena, Los Angeles Union Station, and the Graves Mansion in San Marino, California.

When Wallis announced he was giving Davis top billing, she argued it was ridiculous to do so given hers was a supporting role. The studio&#x27;s publicity department argued it was her name that would attract an audience, and despite her resistance, the film&#x27;s credits and all promotional materials listed her first.

Davis and Lukas reprised their roles for a radio adaptation that aired in the January 10, 1944 broadcast of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;.

==Box office==
According to Warner Bros records the film earned $2,149,000 domestically and $1,243,000 foreign.

==Critical reception==
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; &quot;a distinguished film — a film full of sense, power and beauty&quot; and added, &quot;Its sense resides firmly in its facing one of civilization&#x27;s most tragic ironies, its power derives from the sureness with which it tells a mordant tale and its beauty lies in its disclosures of human courage and dignity. It is meager praise to call it one of the fine adult films of these times.&quot; He continued, &quot;Miss Hellman&#x27;s play tends to be somewhat static in its early stretches on the screen. With much of the action confined to one room in the American home, development depends largely on dialogue — which is dangerous in films. But the prose of Miss Hellman is so lucid, her characters so surely conceived and Mr. Shumlin has directed for such fine tension in this his first effort for the screen that movement is not essential. The characters propel themselves.&quot; In conclusion, he said, &quot;An ending has been given the picture which advances the story a few months and shows the wife preparing to let her older son follow his father back to Europe. This is dramatically superfluous, but the spirit is good in these times. And it adds just that much more heroism to a fine, sincere, outspoken film.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a distinguished picture...even better than its powerful original stage version. It expresses the same urgent theme, but with broader sweep and in more affecting terms of personal emotion. The film more than retains the vital theme of the original play. It actually carries the theme further and deeper, and it does so with passionate conviction and enormous skill...Just as he was in the play, Paul Lukas is the outstanding star of the film. Anything his part may have lost in the transfer of key lines to Bette Davis is offset by the projective value of the camera for closeups. His portrayal of the heroic German has the same quiet strength and the slowly gathering force that it had on the stage, but it now seems even better defined and carefully detailed, and it has much more vitality. In the lesser starring part of the wife Davis gives a performance of genuine distinction.&quot;

Davis stated in a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett that she played the role of the wife for &#x27;name value&#x27; because the studio did not consider the film a good financial risk and that her name above the credits would draw audiences. Davis gladly took the secondary role because she felt the story was so important, and that Hellman&#x27;s writing was &quot;super brilliant&quot;.

The National Board of Review of Motion Pictures observed &quot;Paul Lukas here has a chance to be indisputably the fine actor he always has shown plenty signs of being. Bette Davis subdues herself to a secondary role almost with an air of gratitude for being able to at last be uncomplicatedly decent and admirable. It is not a very colorful performance, but quiet loyalty and restrained heroism do not furnish many outlets for histrionic show, and Miss Davis is artist enough not to throw any extra bits of it to prove she is one of the stars.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
The film won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Picture.

It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Paul Lukas won the Academy Award for Best Actor, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama (the first time the award was presented), and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.

Lucile Watson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress but lost to Katina Paxinou in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls.&quot; Dashiell Hammett was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) but lost to the trio of Philip G. Epstein, Julius J. Epstein, and Howard Koch, who won for the work in &quot;Casablanca&quot;.

==Home media==
On April 1, 2008, Warner Home Video released the film as part of the box set &quot;The Bette Davis Collection, Volume 3&quot;.

<text>Christopher S. Claremont (; born November 25, 1950) is an American comic book writer and novelist. Claremont is best known for his 16-year stint on &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; from 1975 to 1991, far longer than that of any other writer, during which he is credited with developing strong female characters as well as introducing complex literary themes into superhero narratives, turning the once underachieving comic into one of Marvel&#x27;s most popular series. During his tenure, &quot;X-Men&quot; was the best-selling comic book in the world.

During his tenure at Marvel, Claremont co-created numerous X-Men characters, such as Rogue, Psylocke (Betsy Braddock), Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat, Phoenix, the Brood, Lockheed, Shi&#x27;ar, Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Guard, Mystique, Destiny, Selene, Reverend William Stryker, Lady Mastermind, Emma Frost, Tessa, Siryn, Jubilee, Rachel Summers, Madelyne Pryor, Moira MacTaggert, Lilandra, Shadow King, Cannonball, Warpath, Mirage, Wolfsbane, Karma, Cypher, Sabretooth, Empath, Sebastian Shaw, Donald Pierce, Avalanche, Pyro, Legion, Nimrod, Gateway, Strong Guy, Proteus, Mister Sinister, Marauders, Purifiers, Captain Britain, Sunspot, Forge, and Gambit.

Claremont wrote many classic stories, including &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; and &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, on which he collaborated with John Byrne. He developed the character of Wolverine into a fan favorite. &quot;X-Men&quot; #1, the 1991 spinoff series premiere that Claremont co-wrote with Jim Lee, remains the bestselling comic book of all time, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. In 2015, Claremont and his &quot;X-Men&quot; collaborator John Byrne were entered into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Claremont was born in London, England. His father was an internist and his mother was a pilot and caterer. Claremont is Jewish on his mother&#x27;s side, and lived in a kibbutz in Israel during his youth. His family moved to the United States when he was three years old, and he was raised primarily on Long Island. Alienated by the sports-oriented suburbs, his grandmother purchased for him a subscription to &quot;Eagle&quot; when he was a child, and he grew up reading &quot;Dan Dare&quot;, finding them more exciting than the Batman and Superman comics of the 1950s and early 1960s. He read works by science fiction writers such as Robert Heinlein, as well as writers of other genres such as Rudyard Kipling and C. S. Forester.

==Career==
===Comics===
====1969–1991====

Claremont initially did not view the comic book industry as the place where he would make his career, as he believed the dwindling readership to be a sign that the industry was dying, and found the material being published to be uninteresting. Instead, when he began at Bard College, he did so as a political theorist, studying acting and political theory, and writing novels with the hope of becoming a director. His first professional sale was a prose story. He graduated in 1972.

Claremont&#x27;s career began in 1969, as a college undergraduate, when he was hired as a gofer/editorial assistant at Marvel Comics. His first professional scripting assignment was &quot;Daredevil&quot; #102 (Aug. 1973). As an entry into regular comics writing, Claremont was given the fledgling feature &quot;Iron Fist&quot; in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; as of issue #23 (Aug. 1975). He was joined two issues later by artist John Byrne. The Claremont/Byrne team continued to work together when the character received its own self-titled series in November 1975. This title lasted 15 issues.

Though his acting career did not yield great success, he functioned well at Marvel, where he obtained a full-time position. One of the first new characters created by Claremont was Madrox the Multiple Man in &quot;Giant-Size Fantastic Four&quot; #4 (Feb. 1975). Marvel&#x27;s editor-in-chief at the time, Len Wein, who recognized Claremont&#x27;s enthusiasm for the new X-Men that Wein and Dave Cockrum had created in 1975, hired Claremont, a relatively young writer, to take over the series as of issue #94 (May 1975), reasoning that doing so would not draw opposition from other writers, given the book&#x27;s poor standing. Claremont approached the job as a method actor, developing the characters by examining their motives, desires and individual personalities. This approach drew immediate positive reaction. According to former Marvel editor-in-chief Bob Harras, &quot;He lived it and breathed it. He would write whole paragraphs about what people were wearing. He really got into these people&#x27;s thoughts, hopes, dreams.&quot; Claremont&#x27;s take on the series has been likened to writing &quot;the Great American Novel about complex characters who just happened to fly&quot;, incorporating surprise character developments and emotional nuances amid the operatic battles that otherwise typified American superhero comics. By his own admission, Claremont acquired a reputation for taking a long time to resolve plot threads, and longtime X-Men editor Louise Simonson recounted that whenever she was at a loss for story ideas, &quot;All I&#x27;d have to do was go through all of the plot threads that he had left for the last year or two.&quot;

Claremont introduced new supporting characters to the &quot;X-Men&quot; series including Moira MacTaggert in issue #96 and Lilandra Neramani in #97. Jean Grey a.k.a. Marvel Girl, one of Marvel&#x27;s first female heroes, underwent a dramatic transformation into the extremely powerful Phoenix in issue #101. Issue #107 (Oct. 1977) saw the introduction of the Starjammers as well as the departure of artist Dave Cockrum. Claremont began his collaboration with artist John Byrne in the following issue.

During his 17 years as &quot;X-Men&quot; writer, Claremont wrote or co-wrote many classic X-Men stories, such as &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; and &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;. Comics writers and historians Roy Thomas and Peter Sanderson observed that &quot;&#x27;The Dark Phoenix Saga&#x27; is to Claremont and Byrne what the &#x27;Galactus Trilogy&#x27; is to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It is a landmark in Marvel history, showcasing its creators&#x27; work at the height of their abilities.&quot; Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;The controversial story created a sensation and &quot;The X-Men&quot; became the comic book to watch.&quot; In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Claremont and Byrne&#x27;s run on &quot;The X-Men&quot; second on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;. Claremont and artist Frank Miller crafted a &quot;Wolverine&quot; limited series in 1982. With artist Walt Simonson, Claremont produced &quot;The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans&quot; in 1982, an intercompany crossover between the top-selling Marvel and DC titles. The New Mutants were introduced by Claremont and Bob McLeod in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #4 (Dec. 1982) and received their own ongoing series soon after. The second X-Men film was loosely based on his 1982 &quot;X-Men&quot; graphic novel &quot;God Loves, Man Kills.&quot;

Besides his work on &quot;X-Men&quot; and its spinoffs, Claremont wrote &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; and &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; during this time. He and artist John Bolton created the Marada the She-Wolf character in 1981. Claremont&#x27;s stories for &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; included the cast of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearing in issue #74 (Oct. 1978) and the introduction of Karma, a character that later joined the New Mutants, in #100 (Dec. 1980). Claremont helped launch the &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; title in March 1982.

Claremont co-created numerous other important female X-Men characters, including Rogue, Betsy Braddock, Mariko Yashida, Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat, Phoenix, Mystique, Lady Mastermind, Emma Frost, Siryn, Rachel Summers, Madelyne Pryor, and Jubilee. He co-created such notable male characters as Sabretooth, Pyro, Avalanche, Strong Guy, Captain Britain, Forge, Mister Sinister, and Gambit.

Claremont launched various &quot;X-Men&quot; spin-offs, beginning with &quot;The New Mutants&quot; in 1982. The spinoffs &quot;Excalibur&quot; and &quot;Wolverine&quot;, initially written by Claremont, followed in 1987 and 1988, respectively. &quot;X-Men&quot; crossover stories written by Claremont during the latter half of his tenure on the series include &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot;, &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot;, and &quot;X-Tinction Agenda&quot;. In 1991, Marvel launched a second &quot;X-Men&quot; title simply called &quot;X-Men&quot; with Claremont and penciler Jim Lee as co-writers. &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 is still the bestselling comic book of all-time, with sales of over 8.1 million copies (and nearly $7 million), according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, which presented honors to Claremont at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con. The sales figures were generated in part by publishing the issue with four different variant covers which showed different characters from the book (and later a fifth gatefold cover that combined all four), large numbers of which were purchased by retailers, who anticipated fans and speculators who would buy multiple copies in order to acquire a complete collection of the covers. Claremont left the series after the first three-issue story arc, due to clashes with editor Bob Harras.

====1992–present====
The 1990s saw Claremont diversify his comics work, as he wrote for other publishers, and wrote his own creator-owned properties. In December 1991, he sent artist Whilce Portacio a proposal to illustrate Claremont&#x27;s project, &quot;The Huntsman&quot;, as a creator-owned project, and when the then-new comics publisher Image Comics was announced in 1992, Claremont was named as one of its founders. However, the project was canceled when Portacio decided instead to do &quot;Wetworks&quot;. Claremont attempted to find other artist for the series, but all those in whom he was interested were either drawing &quot;X-Men&quot; or had their own projects with Image, and thus he did not become one of Image&#x27;s founders. In 1992 he wrote the graphic novel &quot;Star Trek: Debt of Honor&quot;, which was illustrated by Adam Hughes. Stan Lee interviewed Claremont for episode 7 of the 1991–92 documentary series &quot;The Comic Book Greats.&quot;

In 1993, he began writing the 12-issue miniseries &quot;Aliens/Predator: Deadliest of the Species&quot; for Dark Horse Comics, which was completed in 1995. That year saw a decline in his comics output, however, as he turned his focus to writing novels, citing frustration with how the comics industry had become dominated by artists and editors. In 1994, he wrote issues #10–13 of Jim Lee and Brandon Choi&#x27;s series, &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; at Image Comics, in which he finally introduced his creator-owned character, Huntsman.

In 1995, Claremont began writing his creator-owned series, &quot;Sovereign Seven&quot;, which was published by DC Comics, running for 36 issues until 1998.

In 1998, Claremont returned to Marvel as editorial director and the regular writer of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, where he created Valeria Richards. The book was pencilled by artist Salvador Larrocca and inked by Art Thibert for the entirety of his duration on the series. Claremont&#x27;s run on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; would last for 29 issues and 2 annuals, making it his longest tenure on a title outside of the X-Men. Despite outselling books such as &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;, Claremont was fired by editor Bobbie Chase in early 2000, a decision that he was angered by. Claremont also wrote &quot;The Fantastic 4th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; in 2001, a one shot starring the Fantastic Four on an adventure with Sinbad the Sailor. The comic was pencilled Pascual Ferry.

In 2000, as part of the company&#x27;s &quot;Revolution&quot; event, he wrote &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot; until he moved to &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot;, again working with penciller Salvador Larroca. He returned to &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; again for a two-year run starting in 2004, while teaming up with his former &quot;Excalibur&quot; collaborator and artist, Alan Davis.

In 2004, Claremont was co-writer on &quot;JLA&quot; issues #94–99, the &quot;Tenth Circle&quot; story arc for DC Comics, which reunited him with his former &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; artist John Byrne, with Jerry Ordway as inker.

In 2007, Claremont returned to &quot;New Excalibur&quot;, writing a story arc in which the character Nocturne has a stroke. He has completed his first arc on &quot;Exiles,&quot; adding Betsy Braddock to the team.

In 2008 Claremont wrote the miniseries &quot;GeNEXT&quot;, followed by its 2009 sequel, &quot;GeNext: United&quot;. He was the writer of an &quot;X-Men Forever&quot; series which was set in an alternate universe, and focuses on the present day lives of the X-Men in a reality where Magneto never returned following the destruction of Asteroid M in &quot;X-Men&quot; #3 (December 1991). In 2010, Claremont collaborated with Italian comics artist Milo Manara on &quot;X-Women&quot;.

As of 2014 Claremont was under an exclusive contract for Marvel. In April of that year, Marvel launched a &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; series with Claremont as writer, which he finished in March 2015. He re-united with his former &quot;New Mutants&quot; artist Bill Sienkiewicz for the oneshot &quot;New Mutants: War Children&quot; in 2019.

====Writing style====

According to writer/editor Paul Levitz, Claremont&#x27;s complex story structures &quot;played a pivotal role in assembling the audience that enabled American comics to move to more mature and sophisticated storytelling, and the graphic novel.&quot; Claremont&#x27;s editor on the series, Louise Simonson, attributes the X-Men&#x27;s success to his approach to the characters: &quot;Chris took them very seriously. They were real people to him.&quot;

As the writer of &quot;X-Men&quot;, Claremont became known for certain characteristic phrases, such as Wolverine&#x27;s saying, &quot;I&#x27;m the best there is at what I do. And what I do...isn&#x27;t very nice&quot;, which became closely associated with the character.

A 2009 &quot;Slate&quot; article called Claremont the &quot;soapiest writer in comic books... The classic Claremont pose is either a character, head hung in shame with two enormous rivers of tears running down the cheeks as he or she delivers a self-loathing monologue, or a character with head thrown back and mouth open in a shout of rage, shaking tiny fists at heaven and vowing that the whole world will soon learn about his or her feelings.&quot; However, the article goes to state that &quot;the genius of Chris Claremont was that he made mutants a generic stand-in for all minorities&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m an immigrant,&quot; said Claremont in 2014, describing his affinity with outsiders. After arriving in the United States from England, he was beaten up &quot;because I looked like a geek.&quot; His emphasis on the theme of prejudice resonated with readers as the &quot;X-Men&quot; series rose in popularity.

===Novels and acting===
In 1987 Claremont began writing genre novels. His first was a science fiction trilogy about female USAF pilot/astronaut Nicole Shea, consisting of &quot;First Flight&quot; (1987), &quot;Grounded!&quot; (1991), and &quot;Sundowner&quot; (1994). Claremont co-wrote the &quot;Chronicles of the Shadow War&quot; trilogy, &quot;Shadow Moon&quot; (1995), &quot;Shadow Dawn&quot; (1996), and &quot;Shadow Star&quot; (1999), with George Lucas, which continued the story of Elora Danan from the movie&quot; Willow&quot;. Claremont was a contributor to the &quot;Wild Cards&quot; anthology series.

Claremont made a cameo appearance in the opening scene of the 2006 film &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, for which he is credited as &quot;Lawnmower man&quot;. He made a cameo appearance as a Congressional committee member alongside fellow comic book writer Len Wein in an early scene in the 2014 film &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;.

===Charity work===

In December 2010 Claremont appeared at a book signing at Borders at Penn Plaza in Manhattan as part of a series of events nationwide to commemorate World AIDS Day, with 25% of the proceeds of books sold at the event donated to Lifebeat, a nonprofit organization that educates young people on HIV/AIDS prevention.

In July 2011 Claremont signed a deed of gift to Columbia University&#x27;s Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, donating his archives of all his major writing projects over the previous 40 years to the Library&#x27;s nascent comics archives collection, forming the foundation of a research collection focusing on New York City-based cartoonists and comics writers. Following the examination and processing of the materials, which include notebooks, correspondence, early story drafts, plays, novels, comic books and materials from Claremont&#x27;s early training in the theater and his career as an actor, Claremont&#x27;s archive will be housed at the Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library in Butler Library, separate from the graphic novels collection, and will be open to anyone who demonstrates a need for its use, with a Finding Aid being made available online. Claremont&#x27;s longtime editor Louise Simonson said, &quot;his papers will provide many clues, not only to the evolving way comic books are created and presented, but also how they are perceived, licensed, bought and sold in America and around the world.&quot;

A symposium called Comic New York was held March 24–25, 2012 at Columbia University&#x27;s Low Memorial Library to mark the occasion, which was organized by Graphic Novels Librarian Karen Green, Professor Jeremy Dauber, and editor Danny Fingeroth. A discussion between Claremont and Simonson held in recognition of Claremont&#x27;s gift was the keynote event of the symposium, which focused on the intertwined histories of American comics and New York City, which has served both as a breeding ground for creators and the home of the Big Two publishers, Marvel and DC. Signings and panel discussions with other creators, scholars and academics of the comics medium were held during the two-day event. Among the other creators in attendance were Paul Levitz, Al Jaffee, Peter Kuper, Denis Kitchen, Molly Crabapple, John Romita, John Romita Jr., Irwin Hasen, Miss Lasko-Gross and Dean Haspiel.

==Personal life==
In the mid-1970s, Claremont was married to Bonnie Wilford. Following the dissolution of that marriage, he married Beth Fleisher, with whom Claremont co-authored &quot;Dragon Moon&quot;. Fleisher is the cousin (through marriage) of editor Dan Raspler, who was the editor on &quot;JLA&quot; during the six-issue &quot;Tenth Circle&quot; story arc Claremont and John Byrne wrote in 2004. Claremont and Fleisher have twin sons.

<text>Aegimius (Ancient Greek: Αἰγίμιος) was the Greek mythological ancestor of the Dorians, who is described as their king and lawgiver at the time when they were yet inhabiting the northern parts of Thessaly. 

== Mythology ==
Aegimius asked Heracles for help in a war against the Lapiths and, in gratitude, offered him one-third of his kingdom. The Lapiths were conquered, but Heracles did not take for himself the territory promised to him by Aegimius, and left it in trust to the king, who was to preserve it for the sons of Heracles, the Heracleidae.

Aegimius had two sons, Dymas and Pamphylus, who migrated to the Peloponnese and were regarded as the ancestors of two branches of the Doric race, the &quot;Dymanes&quot; and the &quot;Pamphylians&quot; of Anatolia, while the third branch, the &quot;Hylleans&quot;, derived its name from Hyllas, the son of Heracles, who had been adopted by Aegimius.

There existed in antiquity an epic poem &quot;Aegimius&quot; of which a few fragments are extant, and which is sometimes ascribed to Hesiod and sometimes to Cercops of Miletus. The poem, printed among Hesiodic fragments, survives in fewer than a dozen quotations, and seems to have been in part concerned with the myth of Io and Argos Panoptes.

<text>In Greek mythology, Hyllus (; Ancient Greek: Ὕλλος, &quot;Hyllos&quot;) or Hyllas (Ὕλλᾱς, &quot;Hyllas&quot;) was a son of Heracles and Deianira and the husband of Iole.

== Mythology ==
Heracles, whom Zeus had originally intended to be ruler of Argos, Lacedaemon and Messenian Pylos, had been supplanted by the cunning of Hera, and his intended possessions had fallen into the hands of Eurystheus, king of Mycenae. After the death of Heracles, his children, after many wanderings, found refuge from Eurystheus at Athens. Eurystheus, on his demand for their surrender being refused, attacked Athens, but was defeated and slain.

Hyllus and his brothers invaded Peloponnesus, but after a year&#x27;s stay were forced by a pestilence to quit.

They withdrew to Thessaly, where Aegimius, the mythical ancestor of the Dorians, whom Heracles had assisted in war against the Lapidae, adopted Hyllus and made over to him a third part of his territory. After the death of Aegimius, his two sons, Pamphylus and Dymas, voluntarily submitted to Hyllus (who was, according to the Dorian tradition in Herodotus V. 72, really an Achaean), who thus became ruler of the Dorians, the three branches of that race being named after these three heroes. Being desirous of reconquering his paternal inheritance, Hyllus consulted the Delphic oracle, which told him to wait for &quot;the third fruit,&quot; and then enter Peloponnesus by &quot;a narrow passage by sea.&quot;

Accordingly, after three years, Hyllus marched across the isthmus of Corinth to attack Atreus, the successor of Eurystheus, but was slain in single combat by Echemus, king of Tegea. This second attempt was followed by a third under his son Cleodaeus and a fourth under his grandson Aristomachus, both of which were equally unsuccessful. At last, Temenus, Cresphontes and Aristodemus, the sons of Aristomachus, complained to the oracle that its instructions had proved fatal to those who had followed them. They received the answer that by the &quot;third fruit&quot; the &quot;third generation&quot; was meant, and that the &quot;narrow passage&quot; was not the isthmus of Corinth, but the straits of Rhium.

They accordingly built a fleet at Naupactus, but before they set sail, Aristodemus was struck by lightning (or shot by Apollo) and the fleet destroyed, because one of the Heracleidae had slain an Acarnanian soothsayer. The oracle, being again consulted by Temenus, bade him offer an expiatory sacrifice and banish the murderer for ten years, and look out for a man with three eyes to act as guide. On his way back to Naupactus, Temenus fell in with Oxylus, an Aetolian, who had lost one eye, riding on a horse (thus making up the three eyes) and immediately pressed him into his service. According to another account, a mule on which Oxylus rode had lost an eye.

The Heracleidae repaired their ships, sailed from Naupactus to Antirrhium, and thence to Rhium in Peloponnesus. A decisive battle was fought with Tisamenus, son of Orestes, the chief ruler in the peninsula, who was defeated and slain. The Heracleidae, who thus became practically masters of Peloponnesus, proceeded to distribute its territory among themselves by lot. Argos fell to Temenus, Lacedaemon to Procles and Eurysthenes, the twin sons of Aristodemus; and Messene to Cresphontes. The fertile district of Elis had been reserved by agreement for Oxylus.

The Heracleidae ruled in Lacedaemon until 221 BC, but disappeared much earlier in the other countries. This conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians, commonly called the &quot;Return of the Heracleidae,&quot; is represented as the recovery by the descendants of Heracles of the rightful inheritance of their hero ancestor and his sons. The Dorians followed the custom of other Greek tribes in claiming as ancestor for their ruling families one of the legendary heroes, but the traditions must not on that account be regarded as entirely mythical. They represent a joint invasion of Peloponnesus by Aetolians and Dorians, the latter having been driven southward from their original northern home under pressure from the Thessalians.

It is noticeable that there is no mention of these Heracleidae or their invasion in Homer or Hesiod. Herodotus (vi. 52) speaks of poets who had celebrated their deeds, but these were limited to events immediately succeeding the death of Heracles. The story was first amplified by the Greek tragedians, who probably drew their inspiration from local legends, which glorified the services rendered by Athens to the rulers of Peloponnesus.

After Heracles was poisoned by Deianira, Heracles charged Hyllus to marry Iole when he came of age. Hyllus and Iole had a son Cleodaeus, and three daughters, Evaechme, Aristaechme, and Hyllis.

<text>Since You Went Away is a 1944 American epic drama film directed by John Cromwell for Selznick International Pictures and distributed by United Artists. It is an epic about the US home front during World War II that was adapted and produced by David O. Selznick from the 1943 novel &quot;Since You Went Away: Letters to a Soldier from His Wife&quot; by Margaret Buell Wilder. The music score was by Max Steiner, and the cinematography by Stanley Cortez, Lee Garmes, George Barnes (uncredited), and Robert Bruce (uncredited).

The film is set in a mid-sized American town, where people with loved ones in the armed forces try to cope with their changed circumstances and make their own contributions to the war effort. The town is near a military base, and some of the characters are troops serving Stateside.

Though sentimental in places, &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; is somber at times about the effects of war on ordinary people. Some characters on the home front are dealing with grief, loneliness, or fear for the future. Wounded and disabled troops are shown in the hospital scenes.

==Plot==
&quot;This is a story of the Unconquerable Fortress: the American Home...1943&quot; In January 1943, Anne Hilton is an upper-middle-class housewife living in a Midwestern town near a military base with her two teenage daughters, Jane and Bridget (&quot;Brig&quot;). Anne&#x27;s beloved husband Tim Hilton has volunteered for U.S. Army service in World War II. Anne has just returned from seeing her husband off to Camp Claiborne, and she and her daughters must adjust to Tim&#x27;s absence and make other sacrifices for the war effort, including food rationing; planting a victory garden; giving up the services of their loyal maid Fidelia who nevertheless offers to continue working part-time for the Hiltons while foregoing wages; and taking in a boarder, the curmudgeonly retired Colonel Smollett. When the Hiltons travel by train in a failed attempt to see Tim one last time before he ships out, they encounter or travel with many other people whose lives have been affected by the war, and they end up not getting to see Tim because their train is delayed to allow a defense supply train to go through first. In contrast, the Hiltons&#x27; socialite neighbor Emily Hawkins complains about the inconveniences caused by the war and engages in unsupportive behaviors such as hoarding food and criticizing the Hiltons&#x27; efforts.

The Colonel has a strained relationship with his young grandson, Bill Smollett, because Bill &quot;was kicked out&quot; of West Point and is now serving in the U.S. Army as a mere corporal rather than an officer. An old friend of Anne and Tim&#x27;s, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Tony Willett, also visits the Hiltons while awaiting his orders. Bill quickly falls for Jane, who has a crush on Tony, who in turn has long been attracted to Anne. However, after Tony leaves, Bill and Jane&#x27;s relationship slowly develops and they fall in love. They become engaged, but Bill convinces Jane to wait until after the war to get married. Bill finally is sent overseas and Jane tearfully runs after his departing train to tell him goodbye. The Colonel, who under his gruff exterior really does care about his grandson, conveys his good wishes to Bill via Anne, but arrives too late to say goodbye in person.

Jane is determined to do more for the war effort and begins volunteering as a nurses&#x27; aide at the nearby military hospital, where returning veterans with physical and mental injuries are sent to recover. The family learns via telegram that Tim Hilton is missing in action in the Southwest Pacific. Shortly after Bill&#x27;s departure, the Hiltons receive word that he was killed in action at Salerno. The Hiltons and the Colonel grieve together for Bill. Jane and Anne finally tell off Emily Hawkins after Emily suggests that it is unseemly for Jane to volunteer at the hospital, and Anne decides she herself must do more to help and trains as a welder for defense work at the shipyard.

Tony returns on leave and talks to Anne about his feelings for her, but she believes that he only keeps her as a romantic ideal because she is married to his friend Tim and therefore unattainable. Anne and Tony decide to leave things as they are and remain friends. On Christmas Eve, Fidelia places gifts under the tree that Tim had given her months earlier to leave for his family, and Anne is moved to tears. Anne then gets a cablegram by telephone informing her that Tim is safe and is coming home, and she and her daughters joyfully embrace. &quot;Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord.&quot;

==Reception==
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther, &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; features a script with an &quot;excess of exhausting emotional detail&quot;; Crowther was impressed with the performances, but had issues with the film as a whole:

As the mother and center of the family, Claudette Colbert gives an excellent show of gallantly self-contained emotion, and Jennifer Jones is surpassingly sweet as a well-bred American daughter in the first bloom of womanhood and love. Robert Walker is uncommonly appealing as the young soldier whom she tragically adores, and Shirley Temple, now grown to &quot;teen-age freshness&quot;, is pert as the young sister. Monty Woolley makes a full-blown character of the man who comes to lodge; Joseph Cotten is droll as the Navy playboy, and Hattie McDaniel does an Andy-act quite well... No doubt, this would have been a sharper picture if Mr. Selznick had played it in much less time, and it would have been considerably more significant had he kept it somewhat closer to average means. Two hours and fifty-one minutes is a lot of time to harp upon one well-known theme -lonesomeness and anxiety. And that is all this picture really does.

Literary critic Manny Farber, writing in The New Republic registers this appraisal:

The movie was successful and earned $4,950,000 in North American rentals during its theatrical release, and over $7 million in rentals overall.

==Accolades==
==Home media==
&quot;Since You Went Away&quot; was released to DVD by MGM Home Video on October 19, 2004, in a Region 1 fullscreened DVD. It was later released on Blu-ray by Kino Classics on November 21, 2017.

==In popular culture==
The farewell scene between Jones and Walker at the railway station was parodied in the film &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980).

<text>The Emergency Broadcast System (EBS), sometimes called the Emergency Action Notification System (EANS), was an emergency warning system used in the United States. It was the most commonly used, along with the Emergency Override system. It replaced the previous CONELRAD system and was used from 1963 to 1997, at which point it was replaced by the Emergency Alert System.

==Purpose==
The system was established to provide the president of the United States with an expeditious method of communicating with the American public in the event of war, threat of war, or grave national crisis. It was modeled after Civ-Alert, an emergency warning system in Hawaii. The Emergency Broadcast System replaced CONELRAD on August 5, 1963. In later years, it was expanded for use during peacetime emergencies at the state and local levels.

Although the system was never used for a national emergency, it was activated more than 20,000 times between 1976 and 1996 to broadcast civil emergency messages and warnings of severe weather hazards.

== National level EBS ==
An order to activate the EBS at the national level would have originated with the president and been relayed via the White House Communications Agency duty officer to one of two origination points – either the Aerospace Defense Command (ADC) or the Federal Preparedness Agency (FPA) – as the system stood in 1978. Participating telecommunications common carriers, radio and television networks, the Associated Press, and United Press International would receive and authenticate (by means of code words) an Emergency Action Notification (EAN) via a teletypewriter network designed specifically for this purpose. These recipients would relay the EAN to their subscribers and affiliates.

Enemy attack or nuclear attack warning procedures under EBS changed with time. In 2024, the United States National Archives made available prerecorded messages dating to 1972 that were intended to be played during a national activation of the Emergency Broadcast System. A presidential EBS activation message without attack warning appears at 1:05:55 on side 2 of prerecorded tape number 027:

&quot;The United States Emergency Broadcast System has been activated by direction of the President of the United States because of a grave national emergency. The Emergency Broadcast System comprises all communications facilities designated and authorized by the Federal Communications Commission to operate during a period of national emergency.&quot;

This &quot;grave national emergency&quot; message recording and script above was not in use by individual stations or published in any known FCC document. 

The release of the EAN by the Aerospace Defense Command or the Federal Preparedness Agency would initiate a process by which the common carriers would link otherwise independent networks such as ABC, CBS, and NBC into a single national network from which even independent stations could receive programming. &quot;Broadcast stations would have used the 2-tone Attention Signal on their assigned broadcast frequency to alert other broadcast stations to stand by for a message from the president.&quot; The transmission of programming on a broadcast station&#x27;s assigned frequency, and the fact that television networks/stations and FM radio stations could participate, distinguished EBS from CONELRAD. EBS radio stations would not necessarily transmit on 640 or 1240 on the AM dial, and FM radio and television would carry the same audio program as AM radio stations did.

==Activation procedure==
Actual activations originated with a primary station known as a Common Program Control Station (CPCS-1), which would transmit the . The Attention Signal most commonly associated with the system was a combination of the sine waves of 853 and 960 Hzsuited to attract attention due to its unpleasantness. Decoders at relay stations would sound an alarm, alerting station personnel to the incoming message. Then, each relay station would broadcast the alert tone and rebroadcast the emergency message from the primary station. The Attention Signal was developed in the mid-1960s.

A nationwide activation of the EBS was called an Emergency Action Notification (EAN) and was the only activation that stations were not allowed to ignore; the Federal Communications Commission made local civil emergencies and weather advisories optional (except for stations that agreed to be the &quot;primary&quot; source of such messages).

To activate the EAN protocol, the Associated Press and United Press International wire services would notify stations with a special message. It began with a full line of X&#x27;s, and a bell inside the Teletype machine would sound ten times. To avoid abuse and mistakes, the message included a confirmation password which changed daily. Stations that subscribed to one of the wire services were not required to activate the EBS if the activation message did not have proper confirmation.

===False alarm of 1971===
A properly authenticated Emergency Action Notification was incorrectly sent to United States broadcast stations at 9:33 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 20, 1971.
At the usual time a weekly EAN test was performed, teletype operator W.S. Eberhart had three tapes in front of him: a test tape, and two tapes indicating a real emergency, instructing the use of EAN Message #1, and #2, respectively. He inadvertently used the wrong tape, which used an unexpected codeword, &quot;HATEFULNESS&quot;. The message ordered stations to cease regular programming immediately and begin an Emergency Action Notification using Message #1. Message 1 stated that regular programming had been interrupted at the request of the United States government but was not specific about the cause. A cancellation message was sent at 9:59 a.m. EST, but it used the same codeword as the original message. A cancellation message with the &quot;correct&quot; codeword was not sent until 10:13 a.m. EST. After 40 minutes and six incorrect or improperly formatted cancellation messages, the accidental activation was officially terminated.

This false alarm demonstrated major flaws in the practical implementation of an EAN. Many stations didn&#x27;t receive the alert but more importantly, those that did either ignored it (convinced it was false because it came at the time of a scheduled test), canceled the EAN prematurely with or without any coded indication that the alert was erroneous, or didn&#x27;t have EAN procedure documents readily accessible to them, so they had no indication of what to do. It is estimated that only 20% of the stations that received the activation followed the procedures completely. Several stations went off the air, as they were instructed to do. Recordings from stations that did not (and are not supposed to, according to EAN procedures) include one from WOWO in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for which a recording of the EAN activation exists.

This false alarm was sufficiently disruptive to move the FCC to temporarily suspend the use and testing of Emergency Action Notifications (EANs) by codeword effective February 25, 1971. In the meantime, a national EBS activation (actual or test) would be routed through news service broadcast desks, then authenticated with the White House communications center, introducing a delay of approximately one minute. Numerous investigations were launched and several changes were made to the EBS. Among them, EAN Message #2, which contains specific language indicating an imminent attack, was eliminated. Another change was moving the tapes for genuine alerts away from the broadcasting machines to prevent them from being mistaken for the weekly test tapes. After numerous safeguards were put in place, the FCC voted to resume automatic national activation of the EBS using EANs in mid-December 1972, almost 20 months after they were suspended.

A United States Emergency Broadcast System prerecorded announcement for presidential EBS activation without attack warning did exist, and it could have been distributed from national activation points (such as Federal Preparedness Agency) to radio and TV stations. No such distribution occurred in the 1971 incident, underscoring its falsity.

Following the 1971 incident, FCC publications ultimately removed Message 2 attack warning functions from EBS. FEMA nevertheless confidentially retained EBS attack warning capabilities into the Reagan presidency. Adding somewhat to the confusion, the confidential plan called for distributing prerecorded warning messages through Priority Four channels; in other words, not via any of the published FCC plans cited elsewhere here.

Citations to this confidential plan presently remain limited to a 1981 Reagan White House memo and the actual recorded attack warning announcement itself. 

== System uses ==
Though it was never used, the FCC&#x27;s EBS plan involved detailed procedures for stations to follow during an EAN. It included precise scripts that announcers were to read at the outset of the emergency, as well as whenever detailed information was scarce. Among other things, citizens were instructed not to use the telephone, but rather continue listening to broadcast stations for information.

&quot;The Emergency Broadcast System will carry presidential messages from the National Command Post as they are broadcast. Locally programmed broadcasts from the Emergency Broadcast System will provide you with news of the situation and emergency instructions for your area.&quot;

As late as 1981, the Emergency Broadcast System was capable of carrying messages pertaining to both immediate threats of nuclear attack and messages from the President of the United States. In the event of a national emergency, the White House Press Secretary would be expected to report to the FEMA Special Facility at Mount Weather and order the playing of prerecorded messages. These tapes contained scripted attack warnings, recorded siren sounds and other emergency information for use in the event of nuclear war.

As official information began to emerge from various sources, non-primary stations were to broadcast it according to the following priority list:
* Messages from the president of the United States
* Statewide emergency information
* Local emergency information (for a station&#x27;s operational area, i.e. evacuation and sheltering plans, and severe weather)
* National programming and news (other than a presidential message)

A presidential message was always required to be aired live during an EAN. For other information, stations were to follow the priority list to decide what should be disseminated first. Lower priority official programming - such as an address by a State Governor - was to be recorded for the earliest available rebroadcast unless it were to be an &quot;unusually long&quot; message, in which case it would be carried live.

Participation in EAN emergency broadcasting was done with the &quot;voluntary cooperation&quot; of each station (as noted in the classic test announcement). Stations that were not prepared to be part of the national EBS network were classified as &quot;non-participating&quot; by the FCC. During an EAN, a non-participating station was required to advise listeners/viewers to tune elsewhere to find emergency bulletins. The station&#x27;s transmitter would then be turned off. Non-participating stations had to remain off the air until the EAN was terminated. Under no circumstances could any broadcast station continue with normal programming during a national emergency.

&quot;&quot;All stations not authorized to remain on the air as part of the United States Emergency Broadcast System have been instructed to go off the air&quot;.&quot;

Since FCC rules prohibited unofficial or non-governmental news, information, or entertainment programming during EBS operations, the federal government established a newsroom at Mount Weather. President Gerald Ford&#x27;s White House Press Secretary, Ron Nessen, confirmed the existence of the news center in his book: &quot;&quot;I was shown the president&#x27;s office and living quarters, my office, and facilities for a small number of reporters who would be evacuated with the president&quot;.&quot;

==Testing the system==

Until the system was suspended, radio and television stations were required to perform a &quot;Weekly Transmission Test of the Attention Signal and Test Script&quot; randomly between 8:30 a.m. and local sunset. Stations were required to perform the test at least once a week, and were only exempt from doing so if they had activated the EBS for a state or local emergency, or participated in a coordinated state or local EBS test, during the past week. Additionally, stations were required to log tests they received from each station they monitored for EBS messages. This served as an additional check, as these stations could expect to hear a weekly test from each source. Failure to receive a signal at least once a week meant that either the monitored station was having a problem transmitting the alert signal or the monitoring station was having a problem receiving it.

===Test procedure===
====Opening announcement====
First, normal programming was suspended, though tests were typically conducted during commercial breaks for continuity reasons. Television stations would transmit a video slide such as those seen throughout this article; numerous designs were available or used over the years. Some stations even had multiple slides that they used for their tests in rotation, one for the opening announcement, another for the attention signal transmission, and another for the closing announcement. One of the following announcements was transmitted:
* &quot;&quot;This is a test. For the next sixty&quot; (or thirty) &quot;seconds, this station will conduct a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test.&quot;&quot;
* &quot;(name of host station in a particular market) &quot;is conducting a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test.&quot; (mainly radio stations used this particular announcement)
* &quot;This is a test. (Name of Host Station) is conducting a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test.&quot;&quot;
* &quot;This is a test. This station is conducting a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test.&quot;
* &quot;&quot;This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test.&quot;
* &quot;The following is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System.&quot;&quot;
* &quot;This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. Important information will follow this tone.&quot;

Alternatively, the name &quot;Emergency Broadcasting System&quot; or &quot;Emergency Action Notification System&quot; could be used.

====Attention Signal====
Next, the Attention Signal was transmitted. Prior to 1976, primary stations would turn their transmitters off for five seconds, back on for five seconds, off for five seconds more, then go back on air and transmit a 1000 Hz tone for 15 seconds to alert secondary stations, as was used by predecessor CONELRAD. Television stations adhered to similar rules, but switched only their sound carriers off. This quick off-and-on became known to broadcast engineers as the &quot;EBS Stress Test&quot;, as older transmitters would sometimes fail after the quick cycling on and off.

Starting in 1976, the two-tone Attention Signal (853 Hz and 960 Hz) was implemented, replacing the 1000 Hz tone and eliminating the need to switch the transmitter on and off. From 1976 to 1995, stations were required to broadcast the Attention Signal from the EBS encoder for 20 to 25 seconds; in mid-1995, a new rule was put in place that gave stations the option to transmit the attention signal for anywhere from eight to 25 seconds. Noncommercial educational FM radio stations operating at 10 watts or less and low-powered TV stations were exempt from transmitting the Attention Signal.

====Mid-test announcement====
Third, another announcement was transmitted following the attention signal. The first part read either:
* &quot;&quot;This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. The broadcasters of your area in voluntary cooperation with the FCC and other authorities&quot; (or, in later years, &quot;federal, state and local authorities&quot;) &quot;have developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an emergency.&quot;
* &quot;This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. Broadcasters, in cooperation with the FCC and other authorities&quot; (or, in later years, &quot;federal, state and local authorities&quot;) &quot;have developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an emergency.&quot;

Some stations began their tests with this first part of the announcement, then proceeded to the Attention Signal, and then continued with the second part of the announcement described below.
There were a number of variations for the second half of the statement. During the system&#x27;s early days, stations other than the designated primary station for an operational area were required to shut down in the event of an emergency (reminiscent of the CONELRAD days), and the message was a variation of:
* &quot;If this had been an actual emergency, you would have been instructed to tune in to one of the broadcast stations in your area.&quot;
* &quot;If this had been an actual emergency, you would have been instructed where to tune in your area for news and official information.&quot;

By the early 1980s, it had become easier for stations to record and relay messages from a primary station, and the risk of hostile bombers using broadcast signals to navigate lessened due to the development of ICBMs, as well as more capable on-board navigation systems for manned aircraft. As a result, the requirement for non-primary stations to shut down during an activation of the system was dropped, and the message became:
* &quot;If this had been an actual emergency, the Attention Signal you just heard would have been followed by official information, news, or instructions.&quot;

Stations could also list emergencies that the EBS would potentially be activated for (i.e. tornado warnings, flash flood warnings, hurricane warnings and/or earthquakes); at least two stations - WRTI-AM-FM in Philadelphia and WXYZ-TV in Detroit - infamously made explicit reference to an attack on the United States as being a possible scenario for an EBS activation in their test scripts.
In the late 1980s and early 90s, several television stations in the Los Angeles area had specific test scripts that emphasized earthquake preparedness. People living in the Los Angeles area were urged to study an emergency preparedness section in their telephone directories to be prepared for an earthquake or other types of emergencies.

As the EBS was about to be replaced by its successor, the aforementioned Emergency Alert System in the mid-1990s, some stations used the following message:
* &quot;This station is testing its Emergency Broadcast System equipment. The EBS will soon be replaced with the Emergency Alert System; the EAS will provide timely emergency warnings.&quot;&quot;

====Conclusion====
Lastly, the test concluded with one of these phrases:
* &quot;(Name of host station) &quot;serves&quot; (name of operational area). &quot;This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System.&quot;
* &quot;Stations of the&quot; (name of the station public broadcasting network, for example: South Dakota Public Broadcasting Network) &quot;serve all operational areas in&quot; (name of state). &quot;This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System.&quot; (Used mostly by statewide public television and/or radio networks.)
* &quot;&quot;This station serves the&quot; (name of operational area). &quot;This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System.&quot;&quot;
* &quot;This station &quot;serves&quot; (name of operational area). &quot;This concludes this Emergency Broadcast System Test.&quot;
* &quot;This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System serving the&quot; (name of operational area).&quot;
* &quot;&quot;This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System on&quot; (name of station).&quot;

====Variations====
Variations of the test script were heard in different parts of the country throughout the years depending on FCC regulations at the time, local preferences, and whether the specific station performing the test was a primary EBS station or not. The announcement text was mandated by the FCC. Stations had the option of either reading the test script live, or using recorded versions. WHEN radio in Syracuse, New York and WGR radio in Buffalo, New York both had a sung version of the most common script. There was also a version done by Los Angeles-based Cheap Radio Thrills, as well as another by the comedy team of Bob and Ray. The FCC declared it illegal to sing the test message, or read it as a joke. However, it was acceptable to read it in another language (for example, French or Spanish), if a station broadcast in a language other than English, as was done on KWEX-TV in San Antonio, Texas. Copies of the warning message script had a note saying that it was acceptable to broadcast in any other language, so long as it was broadcast in English as well.

Additionally, for a time during the 1980s, WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut had a woman appearing onscreen to deliver the opening and closing test announcements by using sign language (for the deaf people across the Hartford television market), accompanied by a male announcer reading both announcements as they were displayed on screen.

===Purpose of the Test, Cultural Impact and Criticism===
The purpose of the tests was to allow the FCC and broadcasters to verify that EBS tone transmitters and decoders were functioning properly. In addition to the weekly tests, test activations of the entire system were conducted periodically for many years. These tests showed that about 80% of broadcast outlets nationwide would carry emergency programming within a period of five minutes if it had ever become necessary to activate the EBS at the national level.

The weekly broadcasts of the EBS attention signal and test scripts made it a significant part of the American cultural fabric of its time, and became the subject of a great number of jokes and skits, such as the sung versions of the announcement in the mid-1970s. In addition, many people have testified to being frightened by the test patterns and attention signal as children, and even more so by actual emergencies.

Although intended for the president to communicate with the American people in the event of a national emergency, many critics questioned whether the EBS would work in an actual emergency scenario. Curt Beckmann of WCCO-AM expressed his doubts about the system&#x27;s effectiveness in a 1984 interview:

<text>An attosecond (abbreviated as as) is a unit of time in the International System of Units (SI) equal to 10−18 or 1⁄1 000 000 000 000 000 000 (one quintillionth) of a second. 

An attosecond is to a second, as a second is to approximately 31.69 billion years. 

The attosecond is a tiny unit, but it has various potential applications: it can observe oscillating molecules, the chemical bonds formed by atoms in chemical reactions, and other extremely tiny and extremely fast things.

One attosecond is equal to 1000 zeptoseconds, or 1/1000 femtosecond. Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger, measurements of 10−17 and 10−16 second are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of attoseconds.

== Common measurements ==

* 0.247 attoseconds: travel time of a photon across &quot;the average bond length of molecular hydrogen&quot;
* 24.189... attoseconds: the atomic unit of time
* 43 attoseconds: the shortest pulses of laser light yet created
* 53 attoseconds: the shortest electron laser pulse ever created 
* 53 attoseconds: the second-shortest pulses of laser light created
* 82 attoseconds (approximately): half-life of beryllium-8, maximum time available for the triple-alpha process for the synthesis of carbon and heavier elements in stars
* 84 attoseconds: the approximate half-life of a neutral pion
* 100 attoseconds: fastest-ever view of molecular motion
* 320 attoseconds: the estimated time it takes electrons to transfer between atoms

== Historical development ==

In 2001, Ferenc Krausz and his team at the Technical University of Vienna fired an ultrashort wavelength (7 femtoseconds) red laser pulse into a stream of neon atoms, where the stripped electrons were carried by the pulse and almost immediately re-ejected into the neon nucleus.

While capturing the attosecond pulse, the physicists also demonstrated its utility. They aimed attosecond and longer-wavelength red pulses at a type of krypton atom simultaneously: first, the electrons were knocked off; then, the red light pulse hit the electrons; finally, the energy was tested. Judging from the difference in the timing of these two pulses, the scientists obtained a very precise measurement of how long it took the electron to decay (how many attoseconds). Never before have scientists used such a short time scale to study the energy of electrons.

== Applications ==

=== Need for more precise units ===
The crystal lattice vibrates and molecules rotate on a scale of picoseconds. The creation and breaking of chemical bonds and molecular vibration happen in femtoseconds. Observing the motion of electrons happens on the attosecond scale.

The number of electrons in an atom and their configuration define an element. Because attosecond pulses are faster than the motion of electrons in atoms and molecules, attosecond provides a new tool for controlling and measuring quantum states of matter. These pulses have been used to explore the detailed physics of atoms and molecules and have potential applications in fields ranging from electronics to medicine.

=== Directly observing the wave oscillations of light ===
Using a method called attosecond streaking, people can see the electrical components of EM waves. Scientists start with a gas of neon atoms and ionize them with a single ultrashort burst of UV radiation measured in attoseconds. The electric field of the infrared can then strongly influence the motion of the electrons. The electrons will be forced up and down as the field oscillates. Depending on when the electron is released, this process will emit different final energies. The final measurement of the electron&#x27;s energy, as a function of the relative delay between the two pulses, clearly shows the traces of the electric field of the attosecond pulse.

=== Short pulses of light ===
The 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz, and Anne L&#x27;Huillier for demonstrating a way to create &quot;almost unimaginably&quot; short pulses of light, measured in attoseconds. These pulses can be used to capture and study rapid processes inside atoms, such as the behavior of electrons.

<text>A femtosecond is a unit of time in the International System of Units (SI) equal to 10 or of a second; that is, one quadrillionth, or one millionth of one billionth, of a second. 

A femtosecond is to a second, as a second is to approximately 31.69 million years.

For context, a ray of light travels approximately 0.3 μm (micrometers) in 1 femtosecond, a distance comparable to the diameter of a virus. The first to make femtosecond measurements was the Egyptian Nobel Laureate Ahmed Zewail, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1999. Professor Zewail used lasers to measure the movement of particles at the femtosecond scale, thereby allowing chemical reactions to be observed for the first time.

The word &quot;femtosecond&quot; is formed by the SI prefix &quot;femto&quot; and the SI unit &quot;second&quot;. Its symbol is fs.

A femtosecond is equal to 1000 attoseconds, or 1/1000 picosecond. Because the next higher SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10−14 and 10−13 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of femtoseconds.

* Typical time steps for molecular dynamics simulations are on the order of 1 fs.
* The periods of the waves of visible light have a duration of about 2 femtoseconds. formula_1 The precise duration depends on the energy of the photons, which determines their color. (&quot;See wave–particle duality&quot;.) This time can be calculated by dividing the wavelength of the light by the speed of light (approximately 3×108 m/s) to determine the time required for light to travel that distance.
==Examples==
* 46 fs – the swiftest chemical reaction known (radiolysis of water leads to the formation of a H2O+ ion, which rapidly reacts to become hydronium (H3O+) and a short lived hydroxyl radical (•OH))
* 200 fs – the average chemical reaction, such as the reaction of pigments in an eye to light
* 300 fs – the duration of a vibration of the atoms in an iodine molecule

<doc id="77691" wikidata="Q10690215" url="?curid=77691" title="Figure of speech">
<text>A figure of speech or rhetorical figure is a word or phrase that intentionally deviates from straightforward language use or literal meaning to produce a rhetorical or intensified effect (emotionally, aesthetically, intellectually, etc.). In the distinction between literal and figurative language, figures of speech constitute the latter. Figures of speech are traditionally classified into &quot;schemes&quot;, which vary the ordinary sequence of words, and &quot;tropes&quot;, where words carry a meaning other than what they ordinarily signify. 

An example of a scheme is a polysyndeton: the repetition of a conjunction before every element in a list, whereas the conjunction typically would appear only before the last element, as in &quot;Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!&quot;—emphasizing the danger and number of animals more than the prosaic wording with only the second &quot;and&quot;. An example of a trope is the metaphor, describing one thing as something it clearly is not, as a way to illustrate by comparison, as in &quot;All the world&#x27;s a stage.&quot;

== Four rhetorical operations ==
Classical rhetoricians classified figures of speech into four categories or :

* addition (), also called repetition/expansion/superabundance
* omission (), also called subtraction/abridgement/lack
* transposition (), also called transferring
* permutation (), also called switching/interchange/substitution/transmutation

These categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot;, of unknown authorship, where they are called —addition), —permutation). Quintillian then mentioned them in &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;. Philo of Alexandria also listed them as addition ().

== Examples ==

Figures of speech come in many varieties. The aim is to use the language imaginatively to accentuate the effect of what is being said. A few examples follow:

* &quot;Round and round the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran&quot; is an example of alliteration, where the consonant &quot;r&quot; is used repeatedly. &quot;Sister Suzy‘s sewing socks for soldiers&quot; is a particular form of alliteration called sibilance, repeating an &quot;s&quot; sound. Both are commonly used in poetry.

* &quot;She would run up the stairs and then a new set of curtains&quot; is a variety of zeugma called a syllepsis. &quot;Run up&quot; can refer either to a quick ascent or to manufacture. The effect is enhanced by the momentary suggestion, through a pun, that she might be climbing the curtains. The ellipsis or omission of the second use of the verb makes the reader think harder about what is being said.
* &quot;Painful pride&quot; is an oxymoron, where two contradictory ideas are placed in the same sentence.
* &quot;I had butterflies in my stomach&quot; is a metaphor, referring to a nervous feeling as if there were flying insects in one&#x27;s stomach.
:To say &quot;it was like having some butterflies in my stomach&quot; is a simile, because it uses the word &quot;like&quot;, which a metaphor does not.
:To say &quot;It was like having a butterfly farm in my stomach&quot;, &quot;It felt like a butterfly farm in my stomach&quot;, or &quot;I was so nervous that I had a butterfly farm in my stomach&quot; could be a hyperbole, because it is exaggerated.
*&quot;That filthy place was really dirty&quot; is an example of tautology, as there are the two words (&#x27;filthy&#x27; and &#x27;dirty&#x27;) having almost the same meaning and are repeated so as to make the text more emphatic.
== Types ==

Scholars of classical Western rhetoric have divided figures of speech into two main categories: schemes and tropes. Schemes (from the Greek , &#x27;form or shape&#x27;) are figures of speech that change the ordinary or expected pattern of words. For example, the phrase, &quot;John, my best friend&quot; uses the scheme known as apposition. Tropes (from Greek , &#x27;to turn&#x27;) change the general meaning of words. An example of a trope is irony, which is the use of words to convey the opposite of their usual meaning (&quot;For Brutus is an honorable man; / So are they all, all honorable men&quot;).

During the Renaissance, scholars meticulously enumerated and classified figures of speech. Henry Peacham, for example, in his &quot;The Garden of Eloquence&quot; (1577), enumerated 184 different figures of speech. Professor Robert DiYanni, in his book &quot;Literature: Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay&quot; wrote: &quot;Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different &quot;figures of speech&quot;, expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense.&quot;

For simplicity, this article divides the figures between schemes and tropes, but does not further sub-classify them (e.g., &quot;Figures of Disorder&quot;). Within each category, words are listed alphabetically. Most entries link to a page that provides greater detail and relevant examples, but a short definition is placed here for convenience. Some of those listed may be considered rhetorical devices, which are similar in many ways.

=== Schemes ===
Schemes are words or phrases whose syntax, sequence, or pattern occurs in a manner that varies from an ordinary usage.
* : restating, through accumulation, already said arguments in a concise and forceful manner.
* Alliteration: the occurrence of the same letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words.
*: Example: &quot;She sells sea shells by the sea shore&quot;.
* Anadiplosis: repetition of a word at the end of a clause and then at the beginning of its succeeding clause.
* Anaphora: the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses.
* Anastrophe: changing the object, subject and verb order in a clause.
* Anti-climax: an abrupt descent (either deliberate or unintended) on the part of a speaker or writer from the strong conclusion that appeared imminent.
*: Example: &quot;People, pets, batteries, ... all are dead.&quot;
* Antimetabole: a sentence consisting of the repetition of words in successive clauses, but in reverse order.
* Antithesis: juxtaposition of opposing or contrasting ideas in separate clauses. 
* Aphorismus: statement that calls into question if a word or phrase is properly used to characterize a subject.
* Aposiopesis: breaking off or pausing speech for dramatic or emotional effect, often through the use of dashes or ellipses.
* Assonance: repetition of vowel sounds: &quot;Smooth move!&quot; or &quot;Please leave!&quot; or &quot;That&#x27;s the fact Jack!&quot;
* Asyndeton: omission of conjunctions between related clauses.
* Chiasmus: two or more clauses related to each other through a reversal of structures in order to make a larger point. subordinate class to antimetabole.
* Climax: arrangement of words in an ascending order.
* Consonance: repetition of consonant sounds, most commonly within a short passage of verse.
* Correlative verse: matching items in two sequences.
* Diacope: repetition of a word or phrase with one or two intervening words.
* Elision: omission of one or more letters in speech, making it colloquial.
* Enallage: wording ignoring grammatical rules or conventions.
* Epanalepsis: ending sentences with their beginning.
* Epiphrase: one or more sentences (typically of the author&#x27;s understanding/expression of the issue) added to the end of a completed sentence
* Epistrophe (also known as antistrophe): repetition of the same word or group of words at the end of successive clauses. The counterpart of anaphora.
* Epizeuxis: repetition of a single word, with no other intervening words.
* Hendiadys: use of two nouns to express an idea when it normally would consist of an adjective and a noun.
* Hendiatris: use of three nouns to express one idea.
* Homeoteleuton: words with the same ending.
* Hypallage: a transferred epithet from a conventional choice of wording.
* Hyperbaton: two ordinary associated words are detached. The term is also used more generally for any figure of speech that transposes natural word order.
* Hypozeuxis: every clause having its own independent subject and predicate.
* Hysteron proteron: the inversion of the usual temporal or causal order between two elements.

<text>The shang () is a Tibetan ritual upturned flat handbell employed by Bonpos and shamans.

==Description==
Shang range in size from approximately three to 20 inches in diameter. They are traditionally believed to originate in Zhangzhung and are symbolically similar to the &quot;dril bu&quot; or ghanta.
Shang are traditionally consecrated and made of sophisticated metallic alloy.

==Use==
A shang consists of three principal parts: the flat bell part proper; the gankyil, which is the centre piece that holds the knocker; and the knocker or striker proper, which is often made of animal horn.

The shang was believed to be useful in receiving information from the Eastern concept of æther, to induce trance or call spirits. The shang is often used in rites in conjunction with the phurba and namkha.

<doc id="77695" wikidata="Q487994" url="?curid=77695" title="Antithesis">
<text>Antithesis (: antitheses; Greek for &quot;setting opposite&quot;, from &quot;against&quot; and &quot;placing&quot;) is used in writing or speech either as a proposition that contrasts with or reverses some previously mentioned proposition, or when two opposites are introduced together for contrasting effect.

Antithesis can be defined as &quot;a figure of speech involving a seeming contradiction of ideas, words, clauses, or sentences within a balanced grammatical structure. Parallelism of expression serves to emphasize opposition of ideas&quot;.

An antithesis must always contain two ideas within one statement. The ideas may not be structurally opposite, but they serve to be functionally opposite when comparing two ideas for emphasis.

According to Aristotle, the use of an antithesis makes the audience better understand the point the speaker is trying to make. Further explained, the comparison of two situations or ideas makes choosing the correct one simpler. Aristotle states that antithesis in rhetoric is similar to syllogism due to the presentation of two conclusions within a statement.

Antitheses are used to strengthen an argument by using either exact opposites or simply contrasting ideas, but can also include both. They typically make a sentence more memorable for the reader or listener through balance and of the words.

== Rhetorical antithesis ==
In rhetoric, antithesis is a figure of speech involving the bringing out of a contrast in the ideas by an obvious contrast in the words, clauses, or sentences, within a parallel grammatical structure.

The term &quot;antithesis&quot; in rhetoric goes back to the 4th century BC, for example Aristotle, &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, 1410a, in which he gives a series of examples.

An antithesis can be a simple statement contrasting two things, using a parallel structure:

*I defended the Republic as a young man; I shall not desert her now that I am old. (Cicero, &quot;2nd Philippic&quot;, 2.118)

Often there is a double antithesis, as in the following proverb, where &quot;man&quot; is opposed to &quot;God&quot;, and &quot;proposes&quot; is contrasted with &quot;disposes&quot;:

*Man proposes, God disposes. (anonymous)

Another type is of the form &quot;not A, but B&quot; (negative-positive), in which the point made is emphasised by first being contrasted with its negative:

*I came not to bring peace but a sword. (St Matthew&#x27;s Gospel, 10:34)

Another type involves an antimetabole (AB, BA word order), in which the contrasted words switch places:

*In peace you long for war, and in war you long for peace.
*Two things show feebleness of mind: holding your breath at the time for speaking, and speaking when you should be silent. (Saadi)

The negative-positive antithesis and the antimetabole-antithesis can be combined, as in the following sentence:
*Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country. – Inauguration of John F. Kennedy, 1961.

An antithesis can also be combined with synonymous parallelism. In the following example, the first (A, A&#x27;) and second couplet (B, B&#x27;) are parallel synonymously with the same adverb and verb combination distinguishing the couplets: &quot;still do&quot;/&quot;still be&quot;//&quot;still do&quot;/&quot;still be.&quot; An antithesis is formed with line A contrasting &quot;evil&quot; with &quot;right&quot; in line B. Line A&#x27; contrasts the &quot;filthy&quot; with the &quot;holy&quot; in line B&#x27;.
::• A Let the evildoer still do evil, 
::• A&#x27; and the filthy still be filthy,
::• B and the righteous still do right. 
::• B&#x27; and the holy still be holy (Revelation 22:11).

Twentieth-century rhetorician Kenneth Burke discusses the rhetorical aesthetic and stylistic effects of antithesis in one of the most referenced passages of &quot;A Rhetoric of Motives&quot;, one of his most famous works. In that book, Burke describes how antithesis can invite people to hold an &quot;attitude of collaborative expectancy&quot; through the rhetorical aesthetic principle of form.

=== Some literary examples ===
Some other examples of antithesis are:

* Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice. (William Shakespeare, &quot;Hamlet&quot;)
* For many are called, but few are chosen. (Matthew 22:14)
* Never give in — never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. (by Winston Churchill)
* It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way... (Charles Dickens, &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;)
* We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools. (Martin Luther King Jr., speech at St. Louis, 1964.)
* The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. (Abraham Lincoln, The Gettysburg Address, 1863.)
* He who desires peace, should prepare for war. (Vegetius, &quot;Epitoma Rei Militaris&quot;, book 3, introduction.)
* For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood. (St Paul, 1st Epistle to the Corinthians 13:12, Revised Standard Version-Catholic Edition)
* My men have become women, and my women, men. (King Xerxes at the Battle of Salamis (480 BC), according to Herodotus 8.88.3)
* Senator, in everything I said about Iraq I turned out to be right and you turned out to be wrong. (George Galloway at a US Senate hearing, May 2005.)
* I&#x27;m not saying that this or that statue was stolen from there; I&#x27;m saying this, that you, Verres, left not one single statue in Aspendus. (Cicero, &quot;In Verrem&quot;, 2.1.53.)
* I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. (Martin Luther King Jr., 1963.)
* For contemplation he and valour formed, For softness she and sweet attractive grace; He for God only, she for God in him. (John Milton, Paradise Lost)

== The &quot;Antitheses&quot; in St Matthew&#x27;s Gospel ==
&quot;Matthew&#x27;s Antitheses&quot; is the traditional name given to a section of the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus takes six well known prescriptions of the Mosaic Law and calls his followers to do more than the Law requires. Protestant scholars since the Reformation have generally believed that Jesus was setting his teaching over against false interpretations of the Law current at the time. &quot;Antithesis&quot; was the name given by Marcion of Sinope to a manifesto in which he contrasted the Old Testament with the New Testament and defined what came to be known as Marcionism.

== In philosophical discussion ==

In dialectics (any formal system of reasoning that arrives at the truth by the exchange of logical arguments) antithesis is the juxtaposition of contrasting ideas, usually in a balanced way. The logical arguments are said to be stated in the order thesis, antithesis, synthesis.

Although this style of philosophical discussion (stating a point of view, then its opposite, and finally drawing a conclusion) was commonly used by ancient philosophers, the use of the trio &quot;thesis, antithesis, synthesis&quot; itself to describe it goes back only to the 18th century, to a work published in 1794 by the German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte.

The phrase is sometimes incorrectly stated to originate from the German philosopher Hegel. However, Hegel never actually used the trio of terms except once in a lecture, in which he reproached Immanuel Kant for having &quot;everywhere posited thesis, antithesis, synthesis&quot;.

<doc id="77697" wikidata="Q155656" url="?curid=77697" title="Will and testament">
<text>A will and testament is a legal document that expresses a person&#x27;s (testator) wishes as to how their property (estate) is to be distributed after their death and as to which person (executor) is to manage the property until its final distribution. For the distribution (devolution) of property not determined by a will, see inheritance and intestacy.

Though it has been thought a &quot;will&quot; historically applied only to real property, while &quot;testament&quot; applied only to personal property (thus giving rise to the popular title of the document as &quot;last will and testament&quot;), records show the terms have been used interchangeably. Thus, the word &quot;will&quot; validly applies to both personal and real property. A will may also create a testamentary trust that is effective only after the death of the testator.

==History==

Throughout most of the world, the disposition of a dead person&#x27;s estate has been a matter of social custom. According to Plutarch, the written will was invented by Solon. Originally, it was a device intended solely for men who died without an heir.

The English phrase &quot;will and testament&quot; is derived from a period in English law when Old English and Law French were used side by side for maximum clarity. Other such legal doublets include &quot;breaking and entering&quot; and &quot;peace and quiet&quot;.

== Freedom of disposition ==
The concept of the freedom of disposition by will, familiar as it is in modern England and the United States, both generally considered common law systems, is by no means universal. In fact, complete freedom is the exception rather than the rule. Civil law systems often put restrictions on the possibilities of disposal; see for example &quot;Forced heirship&quot;.

LGBT advocates have pointed to the inheritance rights of spouses as desirable for same-sex couples as well, through same-sex marriage or civil unions. Opponents of such advocacy rebut this claim by pointing to the ability of same-sex couples to disperse their assets by will. Historically, however, it was observed that &quot;[e]ven if a same-sex partner executes a will, there is risk that the survivor will face prejudice in court when disgruntled heirs challenge the will&quot;, with courts being more willing to strike down wills leaving property to a same-sex partner on such grounds as incapacity or undue influence.

==Types of wills==
Types of wills generally include:
* nuncupative (non-culpatory) – oral or dictated; often limited to sailors or military personnel.
* holographic will – written in the hand of the testator; in many jurisdictions, the signature and the material terms of the holographic will must be in the handwriting of the testator.
* self-proved – in solemn form with affidavits of subscribing witnesses to avoid probate.
* notarial – will in public form and prepared by a civil-law notary (civil-law jurisdictions and Louisiana, United States).
* mystic – sealed until death.
* serviceman&#x27;s will – will of person in active-duty military service and usually lacking certain formalities, particularly under English law.
* reciprocal/mirror/mutual/husband and wife wills – wills made by two or more parties (typically spouses) that make similar or identical provisions in favor of each other.
* joint will – similar to reciprocal wills but one instrument; has a binding effect on the surviving testator(s). First documented in English law in 1769.
* unsolemn will – will in which the executor is unnamed.
* will in solemn form – signed by testator and witnesses.

Some jurisdictions recognize a holographic will, made out entirely in the testator&#x27;s own hand, or in some modern formulations, with material provisions in the testator&#x27;s hand. The distinctive feature of a holographic will is less that it is handwritten by the testator, and often that it need not be witnessed. In Louisiana this type of testament is called an olographic testament. It must be entirely written, dated, and signed in the handwriting of the testator. Although the date may appear anywhere in the testament, the testator must sign the testament at the end of the testament. Any additions or corrections must also be entirely hand written to have effect.

In England, the formalities of wills are relaxed for soldiers who express their wishes on active service; any such will is known as a serviceman&#x27;s will. A minority of jurisdictions even recognize the validity of nuncupative wills (oral wills), particularly for military personnel or merchant sailors. However, there are often constraints on the disposition of property if such an oral will is used.

== Terminology ==
* Administrator – person appointed or who petitions to administer an estate in an intestate succession. The antiquated English term of administratrix was used to refer to a female administrator but is generally no longer in standard legal usage.
* Apertura tabularum – in ancient law books, signifies the breaking open of a last will and testament.
* Beneficiary – anyone receiving a gift or benefiting from a trust
* Bequest – testamentary gift of personal property, traditionally other than money.
* Codicil – (1) amendment to a will; (2) a will that modifies or partially revokes an existing or earlier will.
* Decedent – the deceased (U.S. term)
* Demonstrative Legacy – a gift of a specific sum of money with a direction that is to be paid out of a particular fund.
* Descent – succession to real property.
* – testamentary gift of real property.
* Devisee – beneficiary of real property under a will.
* Distribution – succession to personal property.
* Executor/executrix or personal representative [PR] – person named to administer the estate, generally subject to the supervision of the probate court, in accordance with the testator&#x27;s wishes in the will. In most cases, the testator will nominate an executor/PR in the will unless that person is unable or unwilling to serve. In some cases a literary executor may be appointed to manage a literary estate.
* clause is the first paragraph or sentence in a will and testament, in which the testator identifies himself or herself, states a legal domicile, and revokes any prior wills.
* Inheritor – a beneficiary in a succession, testate or intestate.
* Intestate – person who has not created a will, or who does not have a valid will at the time of death.
* – testamentary gift of personal property, traditionally of money. Note: historically, a legacy has referred to either a gift of real property or personal property.
* Legatee – beneficiary of personal property under a will, i.e., a person receiving a legacy.
* Probate – legal process of settling the estate of a deceased person.
* Residuary estate - the portion of an estate remaining after the payment of expenses and the distribution of specific bequests; this passes to the residuary legatees.
* Specific legacy (or specific bequest) – a testamentary gift of a precisely identifiable object.
* Testate – person who dies having created a will before death.
* Testator – person who executes or signs a will; that is, the person whose will it is. The antiquated English term of Testatrix was used to refer to a female.
* Trustee – a person who has the duty under a will trust to ensure that the rights of the beneficiaries are upheld.

==Requirements for creation==

Any person over the age of majority and having &quot;testamentary capacity&quot; (i.e., generally, being of sound mind) can make a will, with or without the aid of a lawyer.

===Content of the will===
Required content varies, depending on the jurisdiction, but generally includes the following:
* The testator must clearly identify themselves as the maker of the will, and that a will is being made; this is commonly called &quot;publication&quot; of the will, and is typically satisfied by the words &quot;last will and testament&quot; on the face of the document.
* The testator should declare that he or she revokes all previous wills and codicils. Otherwise, a subsequent will revokes earlier wills and codicils only to the extent to which they are inconsistent. However, if a subsequent will is completely inconsistent with an earlier one, the earlier will is considered completely revoked by implication.
* The testator may demonstrate that he or she has the capacity to dispose of their property (&quot;sound mind&quot;), and does so freely and willingly.
* The testator must sign and date the will, usually in the presence of at least two disinterested witnesses (persons who are not beneficiaries). There may be extra witnesses, these are called &quot;supernumerary&quot; witnesses, if there is a question as to an interested-party conflict. Some jurisdictions, notably Pennsylvania, have long abolished any requirement for witnesses. In the United States, Louisiana requires both attestation by two witnesses as well as notarization by a notary public. Holographic wills generally require no witnesses to be valid, but depending on the jurisdiction may need to be proved later as to the authenticity of the testator&#x27;s signature.
* If witnesses are designated to receive property under the will they are witnesses to, this has the effect, in many jurisdictions, of either (i) disallowing them to receive under the will, or (ii) invalidating their status as a witness. In a growing number of states in the United States, however, an interested party is only an improper witness as to the clauses that benefit him or her (for instance, in Illinois).
* The testator&#x27;s signature must be placed at the end of the will. If this is not observed, any text following the signature will be ignored, or the entire will may be invalidated if what comes after the signature is so material that ignoring it would defeat the testator&#x27;s intentions.
* One or more beneficiaries (devisees, legatees) must generally be clearly stated in the text, but some jurisdictions allow a valid will that merely revokes a previous will, revokes a disposition in a previous will, or names an executor.

A will may not include a requirement that an heir commit an illegal, immoral, or other act against public policy as a condition of receipt.

In community property jurisdictions, a will cannot be used to disinherit a surviving spouse, who is entitled to at least a portion of the testator&#x27;s estate. In the United States, children may be disinherited by a parent&#x27;s will, except in Louisiana, where a minimum share is guaranteed to surviving children except in specifically enumerated circumstances. Many civil law countries follow a similar rule. In England and Wales from 1933 to 1975, a will could disinherit a spouse; however, since the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 such an attempt can be defeated by a court order if it leaves the surviving spouse (or other entitled dependent) without &quot;reasonable financial provision&quot;.

===Role of lawyers===
There is no legal requirement that a will be drawn up by a lawyer, and some people may resist hiring a lawyer to draft a will. People may draft a will with the assistance of a lawyer, use a software product or will form, or write their wishes entirely on their own. Some lawyers offer educational classes for people who want to write their own will.

When obtained from a lawyer, a will may come as part of an estate planning package that includes other instruments, such as a living trust. A will that is drafted by a lawyer should avoid possible technical mistakes that a layperson might make that could potentially invalidate part or all of a will. While wills prepared by a lawyer may seem similar to each other, lawyers can customize the language of wills to meet the needs of specific clients.

===International wills===
In 1973 an international convention, the &quot;Convention providing a Uniform Law on the Form of an International Will&quot;, was concluded in the context of UNIDROIT. The Convention provided for a universally recognised code of rules under which a will made anywhere, by any person of any nationality, would be valid and enforceable in every country that became a party to the Convention. These are known as &quot;international wills&quot;. It is in force in Australia, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Canada (in 9 provinces, not Quebec), Croatia, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Italy, Libya, Niger, Portugal and Slovenia. The Holy See, Iran, Laos, the Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, the United Kingdom, and the United States have signed but not ratified. International wills are only valid where the convention applies. Although the U.S. has not ratified on behalf of any state, the Uniform law has been enacted in 23 states and the District of Columbia.

For individuals who own assets in multiple countries and at least one of those countries are not a part of the Convention, it may be appropriate for the person to have multiple wills, one for each country. In some nations, multiple wills may be useful to reduce or avoid taxes upon the estate and its assets. Care must be taken to avoid accidental revocation of prior wills, avoid conflicts between the wills, and anticipate jurisdictional and choice of law issues that may arise during probate.

== Revocation ==

=== Methods and effect ===

Intentional physical destruction of a will by the testator will revoke it, through deliberately burning or tearing the physical document itself, or by striking out the signature. In most jurisdictions, partial revocation is allowed if only part of the text or a particular provision is crossed out. Other jurisdictions will either ignore the attempt or hold that the entire will was actually revoked. A testator may also be able to revoke by the physical act of another (as would be necessary if he or she is physically incapacitated), if this is done in their presence and in the presence of witnesses. Some jurisdictions may presume that a will has been destroyed if it had been last seen in the possession of the testator but is found mutilated or cannot be found after their death.

A will may also be revoked by the execution of a new will. Most wills contain stock language that expressly revokes any wills that came before them, because otherwise a court will normally still attempt to read the wills together to the extent they are consistent.

In some jurisdictions, the complete revocation of a will automatically revives the next-most recent will, while others hold that revocation leaves the testator with no will, so that their heirs will instead inherit by intestate succession.

In England and Wales, marriage will automatically revoke a will, for it is presumed that upon marriage a testator will want to review the will. A statement in a will that it is made in contemplation of forthcoming marriage to a named person will override this.

Divorce, conversely, will not revoke a will, but in many jurisdictions will have the effect that the former spouse is treated as if they had died before the testator and so will not benefit.

Where a will has been accidentally destroyed, on evidence that this is the case, a copy will or draft will may be admitted to probate.

=== Dependent relative revocation ===

Many jurisdictions exercise an equitable doctrine known as &quot;dependent relative revocation&quot; (&quot;DRR&quot;). Under this doctrine, courts may disregard a revocation that was based on a mistake of law on the part of the testator as to the effect of the revocation. For example, if a testator mistakenly believes that an earlier will can be revived by the revocation of a later will, the court will ignore the later revocation if the later will comes closer to fulfilling the testator&#x27;s intent than not having a will at all. The doctrine also applies when a testator executes a second, or new will and revokes their old will under the (mistaken) belief that the new will would be valid. However, if for some reason the new will is not valid, a court may apply the doctrine to reinstate and probate the old will, if the court holds that the testator would prefer the old will to intestate succession.

Before applying the doctrine, courts may require (with rare exceptions) that there have been an alternative plan of disposition of the property. That is, after revoking the prior will, the testator could have made an alternative plan of disposition. Such a plan would show that the testator intended the revocation to result in the property going elsewhere, rather than just being a revoked disposition. Secondly, courts require either that the testator have recited their mistake in the terms of the revoking instrument, or that the mistake be established by clear and convincing evidence. For example, when the testator made the original revocation, he must have erroneously noted that he was revoking the gift &quot;because the intended recipient has died&quot; or &quot;because I will enact a new will tomorrow&quot;.

DRR may be applied to restore a gift erroneously struck from a will if the intent of the testator was to enlarge that gift, but will not apply to restore such a gift if the intent of the testator was to revoke the gift in favor of another person. For example, suppose Tom has a will that bequeaths $5,000 to his secretary, Alice Johnson. If Tom crosses out that clause and writes &quot;$7,000 to Alice Johnson&quot; in the margin, but does not sign or date the writing in the margin, most states would find that Tom had revoked the earlier provision, but had not effectively amended his will to add the second; however, under DRR the revocation would be undone because Tom was acting under the mistaken belief that he could increase the gift to $7,000 by writing that in the margin. Therefore, Alice will get 5,000 dollars. However, the doctrine of relative revocation will not apply if the interlineation decreases the amount of the gift from the original provision (e.g., &quot;$5,000 to Alice Johnson&quot; is crossed out and replaced with &quot;$3,000 to Alice Johnson&quot; without Testator&#x27;s signature or the date in the margin; DRR does not apply and Alice Johnson will take nothing).

Similarly, if Tom crosses out that clause and writes in the margin &quot;$5,000 to Betty Smith&quot; without signing or dating the writing, the gift to Alice will be effectively revoked. In this case, it will not be restored under the doctrine of DRR because even though Tom was mistaken about the effectiveness of the gift to Betty, that mistake does not affect Tom&#x27;s intent to revoke the gift to Alice. Because the gift to Betty will be invalid for lack of proper execution, that $5,000 will go to Tom&#x27;s residuary estate.

=== Election against the will ===
Also referred to as &quot;electing to take against the will&quot;. In the United States, many states have probate statutes that permit the surviving spouse of the decedent to choose to receive a particular share of deceased spouse&#x27;s estate in lieu of receiving the specified share left to him or her under the deceased spouse&#x27;s will. As a simple example, under Iowa law (see Code of Iowa Section 633.238 (2005) ), the deceased spouse leaves a will which expressly devises the marital home to someone other than the surviving spouse. The surviving spouse may elect, contrary to the intent of the will, to live in the home for the remainder of his/her lifetime. This is called a &quot;life estate&quot; and terminates immediately upon the surviving spouse&#x27;s death.

The historical and social policy purposes of such statutes are to assure that the surviving spouse receives a statutorily set minimum amount of property from the decedent. Historically, these statutes were enacted to prevent the deceased spouse from leaving the survivor destitute, thereby shifting the burden of care to the social welfare system.

In New York, a surviving spouse is entitled to one-third of her deceased spouse&#x27;s estate. The decedent&#x27;s debts, administrative expenses and reasonable funeral expenses are paid prior to the calculation of the spousal elective share. The elective share is calculated through the &quot;net estate&quot;. The net estate is inclusive of property that passed by the laws of intestacy, testamentary property, and testamentary substitutes, as enumerated in EPTL 5-1.1-A. New York&#x27;s classification of testamentary substitutes that are included in the net estate make it challenging for a deceased spouse to disinherit their surviving spouse.

== Notable wills ==

In antiquity, Julius Caesar&#x27;s will, which named his grand-nephew Octavian as his adopted son and heir, funded and legitimized Octavian&#x27;s rise to political power in the late Republic; it provided him the resources necessary to win the civil wars against the &quot;Liberators&quot; and Antony and to establish the Roman Empire under the name Augustus. Antony&#x27;s officiating at the public reading of the will led to a riot and moved public opinion against Caesar&#x27;s assassins. Octavian&#x27;s illegal publication of Antony&#x27;s sealed will was an important factor in removing his support within Rome, as it described his wish to be buried in Alexandria beside the Egyptian queen Cleopatra.

In the modern era, the &quot;Thellusson v Woodford&quot; will case led to British legislation against the accumulation of money for later distribution and was fictionalized as &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Bleak House&quot;. The Nobel Prizes were established by Alfred Nobel&#x27;s will. Charles Vance Millar&#x27;s will provoked the Great Stork Derby, as he successfully bequeathed the bulk of his estate to the Toronto-area woman who had the greatest number of children in the ten years after his death. (The prize was divided among four women who had nine, with smaller payments made to women who had borne 10 children but lost some to miscarriage. Another woman who bore ten children was disqualified, for several were illegitimate.)

The longest known legal will is that of Englishwoman Frederica Evelyn Stilwell Cook. Probated in 1925, it was 1,066 pages, and had to be bound in four volumes; her estate was worth $102,000. The shortest known legal wills are those of Bimla Rishi of Delhi, India (four characters in Hindi meaning &quot;all to son&quot;) and Karl Tausch of Hesse, Germany, (&quot;Alles meiner Frau&quot;, meaning &quot;all to wife&quot;). The shortest will is of Shripad Krishnarao Vaidya of Nagpur, Maharashtra, consisting of five letters (&quot;HEIR&#x27;S&quot;).

An unusual holographic will, accepted into probate as a valid one, came out of an accident. On 8 June 1948 in Saskatchewan, Canada, a farmer named Cecil George Harris became trapped under his own tractor. Thinking he would not survive (though found alive later, he died of his injuries in hospital), Harris carved a will into the tractor&#x27;s fender, which read:

The fender was probated and stood as his will. The fender is currently on display at the law library of the University of Saskatchewan College of Law.

==Probate==
After the testator has died, an application for probate may be made in a court with probate jurisdiction to determine the validity of the will or wills that the testator may have created, i.e., which will satisfy the legal requirements, and to appoint an executor. In most cases, during probate, at least one witness is called upon to testify or sign a &quot;proof of witness&quot; affidavit. In some jurisdictions, however, statutes may provide requirements for a &quot;self-proving&quot; will (must be met during the execution of the will), in which case witness testimony may be forgone during probate. Often there is a time limit, usually 30 days, within which a will must be admitted to probate. In some jurisdictions, only an original will may be admitted to probate—even the most accurate photocopy will not suffice. Some jurisdictions will admit a copy of a will if the original was lost or accidentally destroyed and the validity of the copy can be proved to the satisfaction of the court.

If the will is ruled invalid in probate, then inheritance will occur under the laws of intestacy as if a will were never drafted.

<text>The Sistine Chapel ( ; ; ) is a chapel in the Apostolic Palace, the pope&#x27;s official residence in Vatican City. Originally known as the &quot;Cappella Magna&quot; (&#x27;Great Chapel&#x27;), it takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV, who had it built between 1473 and 1481. Since that time, it has served as a place of both religious and functionary papal activity. Today, it is the site of the papal conclave, the process by which a new pope is selected. The chapel&#x27;s fame lies mainly in the frescoes that decorate its interior, most particularly the Sistine Chapel ceiling and &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, both by Michelangelo.

During the reign of Sixtus IV, a team of Renaissance painters including Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli, created a series of frescos depicting the &quot;Life of Moses&quot; and the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;, offset by papal portraits above and &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; drapery below. They were completed in 1482, and on 15 August 1483 Sixtus IV celebrated the first mass in the Sistine Chapel for the Feast of the Assumption, during which the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

Between 1508 and 1512, under the patronage of Pope Julius II, Michelangelo painted the chapel&#x27;s ceiling, a project that changed the course of Western art and is regarded as one of the major artistic accomplishments of human civilization. In a different political climate, after the Sack of Rome, he returned and, between 1535 and 1541, painted &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; for Popes Clement VII and Paul III. The fame of Michelangelo&#x27;s paintings has drawn multitudes of visitors to the chapel since they were revealed five centuries ago.

== History ==
While known as the location of papal conclaves, the primary function of the Sistine Chapel is as the chapel of the Papal Chapel (&quot;Cappella Pontificia&quot;), one of the two bodies of the papal household, called until 1968 the &quot;Papal Court&quot; (&quot;Pontificalis Aula&quot;). At the time of Pope Sixtus IV in the late 15th century, the Papal Chapel comprised about 200 people, including clerics, officials of the Vatican and distinguished laity. There were 50 occasions during the year on which it was prescribed by the Papal Calendar that the whole Papal Chapel should meet. Of these 50 occasions, 35 were masses, of which 8 were held in basilicas, in general St. Peter&#x27;s, and were attended by large congregations. These included the Christmas Day and Easter masses, at which the Pope himself was the celebrant. The other 27 masses could be held in a smaller, less public space, for which the &quot;Cappella Maggiore&quot; was used before it was rebuilt on the same site as the Sistine Chapel.

The &quot;Cappella Maggiore&quot; derived its name, the Greater Chapel, from the fact that there was another chapel also in use by the Pope and his retinue for daily worship. At the time of Pope Sixtus IV, this was the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V, which had been decorated by Fra Angelico. The &quot;Cappella Maggiore&quot; is recorded as existing in 1368. According to a communication from Andreas of Trebizond to Pope Sixtus IV, by the time of its demolition to make way for the present chapel, the &quot;Cappella Maggiore &quot;was in a ruinous state with its walls leaning.

The present chapel, on the site of the &quot;Cappella Maggiore&quot;, was designed by Baccio Pontelli for Pope Sixtus IV, for whom it is named, and built under the supervision of Giovannino de Dolci between 1473 and 1481. The proportions of the present chapel appear to closely follow those of the original. After its completion, the chapel was decorated with frescoes by a number of the most famous artists of the High Renaissance, including Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Pietro Perugino, and Michelangelo.

The first mass in the Sistine Chapel was celebrated on 15 August 1483, the Feast of the Assumption, at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

The Sistine Chapel has maintained its function to the present day and continues to host the important services of the Papal Calendar, unless the Pope is travelling. There is a permanent choir, the Sistine Chapel Choir, for whom much original music has been written, the most famous piece being Gregorio Allegri&#x27;s &quot;Miserere&quot;.

=== Papal conclave ===

One of the functions of the Sistine Chapel is as a venue for the election of each successive pope in a conclave of the College of Cardinals. On the occasion of a conclave, a chimney is installed in the roof of the chapel, from which smoke arises as a signal. If white smoke, which is created by burning the ballots of the election, appears, a new Pope has been elected. If no candidate receives the required two-thirds vote, the cardinals send up black smoke—created by burning the ballots along with wet straw and chemical additives—it means that no successful election has yet occurred.

The first papal conclave to be held on the Sistine Chapel was the conclave of 1492, which took place from 6 to 11 August of the same year and in which Pope Alexander VI, also known as Rodrigo Borja, was elected.

The conclave also provided for the cardinals a space in which they could hear mass, and in which they could eat, sleep, and pass time attended by servants. From 1455, conclaves have been held in the Vatican Palace; until the Great Schism, they were held in the Dominican convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Since 1996, John Paul II&#x27;s Apostolic Constitution &quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot; requires the cardinals to be lodged in the Domus Sanctae Marthae during a papal conclave, but to continue to vote in the Sistine Chapel.

Canopies for each cardinal-elector were once used during conclaves—a sign of equal dignity. After the new Pope accepts his election, he would give his new name; at this time, the other Cardinals would tug on a rope attached to their seats to lower their canopies. Until reforms instituted by Saint Pius X, the canopies were of different colours to designate which Cardinals had been appointed by which Pope. Paul VI abolished the canopies altogether, since, under his papacy, the population of the College of Cardinals had increased so much to the point that they would need to be seated in rows of two against the walls, making the canopies obstruct the view of the cardinals in the back row. In the wake of a conclave taking place to preserve the integrity of the marble floor on the Sistine Chapel, carpenters install a slightly elevated wooden floor alongside a wooden ramp in the entrance for those Cardinals who for one reason or another need to be transported in a wheelchair.

== Architecture ==
=== Structure ===
The chapel is about 35 metres (118 feet) long and wide, with the ceiling rising to about above the main floor.

Its exterior is unadorned by architectural or decorative details, as is common in many Italian churches of the Medieval and Renaissance eras. It has no exterior façade or exterior processional doorways, as the ingress has always been from internal rooms within the Apostolic Palace (Papal Palace), and the exterior can be seen only from nearby windows and light-wells in the palace. Subsidence and cracking of masonry also have affected the Cappella Maggiore, necessitating the building of very large buttresses to brace the exterior walls. The accretion of other buildings has further altered the exterior appearance of the chapel.

The building is divided into three stories of which the lowest is a very tall basement level with several utilitarian windows and a doorway giving onto the exterior court. Internally, the basement is robustly vaulted to support the chapel. The building had six tall arched windows down each side and two at either end, several of which have been blocked. Above the vault is a third story with wardrooms for guards. At this level, an open projecting was constructed, which encircled the building supported on an arcade springing from the walls. The gangway has been roofed as it was a continual source of water leaking into the vault of the chapel.

=== Interior of the Sistine Chapel ===
The general proportions of the chapel use the length as the unit of measurement. This has been divided by three to get the width and by two to get the height. Maintaining the ratio, there were six windows down each side and two at either end. Defined proportions were a feature of Renaissance architecture and reflected the growing interest in the Classical heritage of Rome.


The ceiling of the chapel is a flattened barrel vault springing from a course that encircles the walls at the level of the springing of the window arches. This barrel vault is cut transversely by smaller vaults over each window, which divide the barrel vault at its lowest level into a series of large pendentives rising from shallow pilasters between each window. The barrel vault was originally painted brilliant-blue and dotted with gold stars, to the design of Piermatteo Lauro de&#x27; Manfredi da Amelia. The pavement is in opus alexandrinum, a decorative style using marble and coloured stone in a pattern that reflects the earlier proportion in the division of the interior and also marks the processional way from the main door, used by the Pope on important occasions such as Palm Sunday.

A screen or &quot;transenna&quot; in marble by Mino da Fiesole, Andrea Bregno, and Giovanni Dalmata divides the chapel into two parts. Originally these made equal space for the members of the Papal Chapel within the sanctuary near the altar and the pilgrims and townsfolk without. However, with growth in the number of those attending the Pope, the screen was moved giving a reduced area for the faithful laity. The &quot;transenna&quot; is surmounted by a row of ornate candlesticks, once gilt, and has a wooden door, where once there was an ornate door of gilded wrought iron. The sculptors of the &quot;transenna&quot; also provided the &quot;cantoria&quot; or projecting choir gallery.

== Decoration ==
=== History ===
The first stage in the decoration of the Sistine Chapel was the painting of the ceiling in blue, studded with gilt stars, and with decorative borders around the architectural details of the pendentives. This was entirely replaced when Michelangelo came to work on the ceiling in 1508.

Of the present scheme of frescos, the earliest part is that of the side walls. They are divided into three main tiers. The central tier of the walls has two cycles of paintings, which complement each other, &quot;The Life of Moses&quot; and &quot;The Life of Christ&quot;. They were commissioned in 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV and executed by Domenico Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Cosimo Rosselli and their workshops. They originally ran all round the walls, but have since been replaced on both end walls.

The project was perhaps supervised by Perugino, who arrived at the chapel prior to the Florentines. It is probable that the commission of Ghirlandaio, Botticelli and Roselli was part of a reconciliation project between Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Florence, and Pope Sixtus IV. The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel in the spring of 1481.

Beneath the cycles of &quot;The Life of Moses&quot; and &quot;The Life of Christ&quot;, the lower level of the walls is decorated with frescoed hangings in silver and gold. Above the narrative frescos, the upper tier is divided into two zones. At the lower level of the windows is a &quot;Gallery of Popes&quot; painted at the same time as the &quot;Lives&quot;. Around the arched tops of the windows are areas known as the &quot;lunettes&quot; which contain the &quot;Ancestors of Christ&quot;, painted by Michelangelo as part of the scheme for the ceiling.

The ceiling was commissioned by Pope Julius II and painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512. The commission was originally to paint the twelve apostles on the triangular pendentives which support the vault; however, Michelangelo demanded a free hand in the pictorial content of the scheme. He painted a series of nine pictures showing &quot;God&#x27;s Creation of the World&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s Relationship with Mankind&quot;, and &quot;Mankind&#x27;s Fall from God&#x27;s Grace&quot;. On the large pendentives he painted twelve Biblical and Classical men and women who prophesied that God would send Jesus Christ for the salvation of mankind, and around the upper parts of the windows, the &quot;Ancestors of Christ&quot;.

In 1515, Raphael was commissioned by Pope Leo X to design a series of ten tapestries to hang around the lower tier of the walls. The tapestries depict events from the &quot;Life of St. Peter&quot; [four tapestries] the &quot;Life of St. Paul&quot; [six tapestries], the founders of the Christian Church in Rome. Work began in mid-1515. Due to their large size, manufacture of the hangings was carried out in Brussels, and took four years under the hands of the weavers in the shop of Pieter van Aelst. Raphael&#x27;s tapestries were looted during the Sack of Rome in 1527 and were either burnt for their precious metal content or were scattered around Europe. In the late 20th century, a set was reassembled from several further sets that had been made after the first set, and displayed again in the Sistine Chapel in 1983. The tapestries continue to be used at occasional ceremonies of particular importance. The full-size preparatory cartoons for seven of the 10 tapestries are known as the Raphael Cartoons and are in London.

At this point, the decorative scheme displayed a consistent iconographical pattern. The tier of Popes, which, in the scheme intended by Pope Julius, would have appeared immediately below the Twelve Apostles, would have emphasised the apostolic succession. It has been argued that the present scheme shows the two Biblical Testaments merged in order to reveal the Old predicting and framing the New, synthesizing the logic of the Christian Bible.

This was disrupted by a further commission to Michelangelo to decorate the wall above the altar with &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, 1537–1541. The painting of this scene necessitated the obliteration of two episodes from the &quot;Lives&quot;—the &quot;Nativity of Jesus&quot; and the &quot;Finding of Moses&quot;; several of the &quot;Popes&quot;; and two sets of &quot;Ancestors&quot;.

== Frescoes ==
=== Southern wall ===
The southern wall is decorated with the &quot;Stories of Moses&quot;, painted in 1481–1482. Starting from the altar, they include:
* &quot;Moses Leaving for Egypt&quot; by Pietro Perugino and assistants
* &quot;The Trials of Moses&quot; by Sandro Botticelli and his workshop
* &quot;The Crossing of the Red Sea&quot; by Cosimo Rosselli, Domenico Ghirlandaio or Biagio di Antonio Tucci
* &quot;Descent from Mount Sinai&quot; by Cosimo Rosselli or Piero di Cosimo
* &quot;Punishment of the Rebels&quot; by Sandro Botticelli
* &quot;Testament and Death of Moses&quot; by Luca Signorelli or Bartolomeo della Gatta
=== Northern wall ===

The northern wall houses the &quot;Stories of Jesus&quot;, dating to 1481–1482. They include:
* &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot; by Pietro Perugino and assistants
* &quot;Temptations of Christ&quot; by Sandro Botticelli
* &quot;Vocation of the Apostles&quot; by Domenico Ghirlandaio
* The &quot;Sermon on the Mount&quot;, attributed to Cosimo Rosselli
* The &quot;Delivery of the Keys&quot; by Pietro Perugino
* The &quot;Last Supper&quot; by Cosimo Rosselli

=== Eastern wall ===

*&quot;Resurrection of Christ&quot; by Hendrick van den Broeck (1572) over Domenico Ghirlandaio&#x27;s original
* &quot;Disputation over Moses&#x27; Body&quot; by Matteo da Lecce (1574) over Luca Signorelli&#x27;s original

=== Michelangelo&#x27;s frescoes ===

Michelangelo was commissioned by Pope Julius II in 1508 to repaint the vault, or ceiling, of the chapel. The work was completed between 1508 and late 1512. He painted the &quot;Last Judgment&quot; over the altar, between 1535 and 1541, on commission from Pope Paul III Farnese.

Michelangelo was intimidated by the scale of the commission, and made it known from the outset of Julius II&#x27;s approach that he would prefer to decline. He felt he was more of a sculptor than a painter, and was suspicious that such a large-scale project was being offered to him by enemies as a set-up for an inevitable fall. For Michelangelo, the project was a distraction from the major marble sculpture that had preoccupied him for the previous few years.
The sources of Michelangelo&#x27;s inspiration are not easily determined; both Joachite and Augustinian theologians were within the sphere of Julius&#x27; influence.

==== Ceiling ====

To be able to reach the ceiling, Michelangelo needed a support; the first idea was by Julius&#x27; favoured architect Donato Bramante, who wanted to build for him a scaffold to be suspended in the air with ropes. However, Bramante did not successfully complete the task, and the structure he built was flawed. He had perforated the vault in order to lower strings to secure the scaffold. Michelangelo laughed when he saw the structure, and believed it would leave holes in the ceiling once the work was ended. He asked Bramante what was to happen when the painter reached the perforations, but the architect had no answer.

The matter was taken before the Pope, who ordered Michelangelo to build a scaffold of his own. Michelangelo created a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from holes in the wall, high up near the top of the windows. Contrary to popular belief, he did not lie on this scaffolding while he painted, but painted from a standing position.

Michelangelo used bright colours, easily visible from the floor. On the lowest part of the ceiling he painted the ancestors of Christ. Above this he alternated male and female prophets, with Jonah over the altar. On the highest section, Michelangelo painted nine stories from the Book of Genesis. He was originally commissioned to paint only twelve figures, the Apostles. He turned down the commission because he saw himself as a sculptor, not a painter. The Pope offered to allow Michelangelo to paint biblical scenes of his own choice as a compromise. After the work was finished, there were more than three hundred figures. His figures showed the creation, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the Great Flood.

The painted area is about 40 m (131 ft) long by 13 m (43 ft) wide. This means that Michelangelo painted well over of frescoes.

====&quot;The Last Judgement&quot;====

&quot;The Last Judgement&quot; was painted by Michelangelo from 1535 to 1541, between two important historic events: the Sack of Rome by mercenary forces of the Holy Roman Empire in 1527, and the Council of Trent which commenced in 1545. The work was designed on a grand scale, and spans the entire wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel. The painting depicts the second coming of Christ on the Day of Judgment as described in the Revelation of John, Chapter 20. High on the wall is the heroic figure of Christ, with the saints clustered in groups around him. At the bottom left of the painting the dead are raised from their graves and ascend to be judged. To the right are those who are assigned to Hell and are dragged down by demons.

&quot;The Last Judgement&quot; was an object of a bitter dispute between Cardinal Carafa and Michelangelo. Because he depicted naked figures, the artist was accused of immorality and obscenity. A censorship campaign (known as the &quot;Fig-Leaf Campaign&quot;) was organized by Carafa and Monsignor Sernini (Mantua&#x27;s ambassador) to remove the frescoes. From this campaign drew support for the more natural state of the figures. In response, phallic imagery began permeating throughout Vatican City, beginning the trend of the crude drawings in places such as in graffiti art in bathrooms, textbooks, and other public places to be easily found. This trend continues to the present day.

The Pope&#x27;s Master of Ceremonies Biagio da Cesena said &quot;it was most disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully, and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather for the public baths and taverns.&quot; In response Michelangelo worked da Cesena&#x27;s semblance into the scene as Minos, judge of the underworld. It is said that when he complained to the Pope, the pontiff responded that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell, so the portrait would have to remain. Michelangelo also painted his own portrait, on the flayed skin held by St. Bartholomew.

The genitalia in the fresco were later covered by the artist Daniele da Volterra, whom history remembers by the derogatory nickname &quot;Il Braghettone&quot; (&quot;the breeches-painter&quot;).

== Restoration and controversy ==

The Sistine Chapel&#x27;s ceiling restoration began on 7 November 1984. When the restoration was completed, the chapel was re-opened to the public on 8 April 1994. The part of the restoration in the Sistine Chapel that has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe and removed the original intent of the artist.

The problem lies in the analysis and understanding of the techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to that understanding. A close examination of the frescoes of the lunettes convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in &quot;buon fresco&quot;; that is, the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state. In other words, they believed Michelangelo did not work &quot;a secco&quot;; he did not come back later and add details onto the dry plaster.

The restorers, by assuming that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, took a universal approach to the restoration. A decision was made that all of the shadowy layer of animal glue and &quot;lamp black&quot;, all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of one sort or another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts, and painted definition by later restorers in an attempt to enliven the appearance of the work. Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau&#x27;s critical reading of the restoration data that have been provided, the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster. After treatment, only that which was painted &quot;buon fresco&quot; would remain.
== Replicas ==

The only reproduction of the Sistine Chapel ceiling was painted by Gary Bevans at English Martyrs&#x27; Catholic Church in Goring-by-Sea, Worthing, West Sussex, England. A full-size architectural and photographic replica of the entire building was commissioned by the Mexican government and funded by private donors. It was on view at Mexico City from 1 June to 15 July 2016. It took 2.6 million high definition photographs to reproduce the totality of the frescoes and tapestries. A video of the history of the chapel was shown to visitors before entering the building; inside, a light-and-sound demonstration explained the content of each of the frescoes.

== Music ==
Since the chapel&#x27;s inception, the Sistine Chapel Choir has sung without the accompaniment of musical instruments as instruments were not permitted to be played inside the chapel. This was problematic as there was no way of giving the musical starting pitch to the choir. Instead of allowing an instrument to give the starting pitch, the solution was to allow the individual singing first to choose the starting pitch. This instruction was given after an apostolic visitation of the choir in 1630:

&quot;Quando si ha da cominciare a cantare ciascuno lasci cominciare il più vecchio, quale se non intonata bene dovere essere puntato con rigore.&quot;

On February 19, 2014, Canadian violinist Rosemary Siemens became the first solo instrumentalist to perform at the Sistine Chapel. The historic performance was for an event entitled Spiritual Elevation as part of the Fondazione Pro Musical e Arte Sacra where Siemens was a featured guest soloist alongside vocalist Mary Zilba and harpist Mark Edward Spencer. Siemens, Zilba, and Spencer performed a medley that included the hymns &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and &quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot;. The historic performance took place in concert with the Continuo Arts Symphonic Chorus, led by conductor Candace Wicke. Siemens also joined the Continuo Arts Symphonic Chorus for a Requiem entitled &quot;Requiem For My Mother&quot;, composed by Stephen Edwards.

On April 29, 2016, The Edge (U2) became the first rock artist to stage a contemporary music concert at the chapel as part of a conference on regenerative medicines entitled Cellular Horizons. The Edge performed &quot;Walk On&quot;, &quot;Yahweh&quot;, &quot;Ordinary Love&quot;, by U2 as well as a Leonard Cohen cover of &quot;If It Be Your Will&quot; backed by an Irish Choir.

In 2017, Cecilia Bartoli became the first woman to perform alongside the all-male Sistine Chapel Choir. Bartoli performed Beata Viscera by medieval composer Pérotin.

The first ever live-streamed concert at the chapel took place on April 22, 2018, featuring a performance of Scottish composer James MacMillian&#x27;s version of the Stabat Mater by the British Choir group The Sixteen and chamber orchestra ensemble Britten Sinfonia. The concert was attended live by over three hundred people and streamed live over the website of Classic FM.

<text>A picosecond (abbreviated as ps) is a unit of time in the International System of Units (SI) equal to 10−12 or (one trillionth) of a second. That is one trillionth, or one millionth of one millionth of a second, or 0.000 000 000 001 seconds.

A picosecond is to one second, as one second is to approximately 31,688.76 years.

Multiple technical approaches achieve imaging within single-digit picoseconds: for example, the streak camera or intensified CCD (ICCD) cameras are able to picture the motion of light.

One picosecond is equal to 1000 femtoseconds, or 1/1000 nanoseconds. Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger, measurements of 10−11 and 10−10 second are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of picoseconds. Some notable measurements in this range include:

* 1.0 picoseconds (1.0 ps) – cycle time for electromagnetic frequency 1 terahertz (THz) (1 x 1012 hertz), an inverse unit. This corresponds to a wavelength of 0.3 mm, as can be calculated by multiplying 1 ps by the speed of light (approximately 3 x 108 m/s) to determine the distance traveled. 1 THz is in the far infrared.
* 1 picosecond – time taken by light in vacuum to travel approximately 0.30 mm
* 1 picosecond – half-life of a bottom quark
* ~1 picosecond – lifetime of a single (hydronium) ion in water at 20 °C
* picoseconds to nanoseconds – phenomena observable by dielectric spectroscopy
* 1.2 picoseconds – switching time of the world&#x27;s fastest transistor (845 GHz, as of 2006)
* 1.7 picoseconds – rotational correlation time of water
* 3.3 picoseconds (approximately) – time taken for light to travel 1 millimeter
* 10 picoseconds after the Big Bang – electromagnetism separates from the other fundamental forces
* 34 picoseconds – signal rise time (20% to 80%) of a SFP+ transmitter for 10 Gigabit Ethernet.
* 10 to 150 picoseconds – rotational correlation times of a molecule (184 g/mol) from hot to frozen water
* 100 picoseconds – Unit Interval of a 10 Gbit/s serial communication link, such as USB 3.1.
* 108.7827757 picoseconds – transition time between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom at absolute zero
* 330 picoseconds (approximately) – the time it takes a common 3.0 GHz computer CPU to complete a processing cycle

<text>Gardner Francis Cooper Fox (May 20, 1911 – December 24, 1986) was an American writer known best for creating numerous comic book characters for DC Comics. He is estimated to have written more than 4,000 comics stories, including 1,500 for DC Comics. Fox was also a science fiction author and wrote many novels and short stories.

Fox is known as the co-creator of DC Comics heroes Barbara Gordon, the original Flash, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Doctor Fate, Zatanna and the original Sandman, and was the writer who first teamed several of those and other heroes as the Justice Society of America, and later recreated the team as the Justice League of America. Fox introduced the concept of the Multiverse to DC Comics in the 1961 story &quot;Flash of Two Worlds!&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Gardner Cooper Fox was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Julia Veronica (Gardner) and Leon Francis Fox, an engineer. Unlike many of his contemporaries in the comic book field, such as Jack Kirby and Jerry Siegel, who came from poor backgrounds, Fox came from an affluent family from Long Island. His family was of Irish and English descent, with his first known American ancestor being the either Irish-or-English born Richard Fox arriving in Connecticut in 1635. Fox had a sister, Catherine (born 1916), known as &quot;Kay&quot;.

Fox recalled being inspired at an early age by the great fantasy fiction writers. On or about his eleventh birthday, he was given &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; and &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; by Edgar Rice Burroughs, books which &quot;opened up a complete new world for me.&quot; He &quot;read all of Burroughs, Harold Lamb, Talbot Mundy,&quot; maintaining copies &quot;at home in my library&quot; some 50 years later.

Fox received a law degree from St. John&#x27;s College and was admitted to the New York bar in 1935. He practiced for about two years, but as the Great Depression continued he began writing for DC Comics editor Vin Sullivan. Debuting as a writer in the pages of &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, Fox &quot;intermittently contributed tales to nearly every book in the DC lineup during the Golden Age.&quot; He was a frequent contributor of prose stories to the pulp science fiction magazines of the 1930s and 1940s.

On November 14, 1937, Fox married Lynda J. Negrini. They had two children, Jeffrey Francis Fox (born April 9, 1940), and Lynda Anne Fox (born March 21, 1943).

A polymath, Fox included numerous real-world historical, scientific, and mythological references in his comic strips, once saying, &quot;Knowledge is kind of a hobby with me&quot;. For instance, during a year&#x27;s worth of &quot;Atom&quot; comic strip stories, Fox referred to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the space race, 18th-century England, miniature card painting, Norse mythology, and numismatics. He revealed in letters to fan Jerry Bails that he kept large troves of reference material, mentioning during 1971, &quot;I maintain two file cabinets chock full of stuff. And the attic is crammed with books and magazines...Everything about science, nature, or unusual facts, I can go to my files or the at least 2,000 books that I have&quot;.

==Novels==
Fox wrote both comic book scripts and prose fiction throughout his career. He began writing fiction for the pulp magazines and transferred to writing original paperback novels as the market shifted to that format in the 1950s.

During the mid-to-late 1940s, and into the 1950s, Fox wrote a number of short stories and text pieces for &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and &quot;Planet Stories,&quot; and was published in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;Marvel Science Stories.&quot; He wrote for a diverse range of pulp magazines, including &quot;Baseball Stories,&quot; &quot;Big Book Football Western,&quot; &quot;Fighting Western,&quot; &quot;Football Stories,&quot; &quot;Lariat Stories,&quot; &quot;Ace Sports,&quot; &quot;SuperScience,&quot; &quot;Northwest Romances,&quot; &quot;Thrilling Western,&quot; and &quot;Ranch Romances&quot; for a number of publishing companies.

His first novel, a historical romance entitled &quot;The Borgia Blade&quot;, was published by Belmont Books in 1953. He went on to write novels and short stories using a variety of male and female pseudonyms for a number of publishers, including Ace, Gold Medal, Tower Publications, Belmont Books, Dodd Mead, Hillman, Pocket Library, Pyramid Books and Signet Books.

Fox wrote a pair of sword and planet novels titled &quot;Warriors of Llarn&quot; (1964) and &quot;Thief of Llarn&quot; (1966).

From 1969 to 1970, Belmont Books published a series of sword and sorcery novels by Fox, featuring the barbarian character Kothar. These were &quot; Kothar: Barbarian Swordsman&quot;, &quot; Kothar of the Magic Sword&quot;, &quot; Kothar and the Demon Queen&quot;, &quot;Kothar and the Conjurer&#x27;s Curse&quot; and finally &quot;Kothar and the Wizard Slayer&quot;. These were followed in 1976 by another series (published by Leisure Books) featuring the barbarian Kyrik: &quot; Kyrik: Warlock Warrior&quot;, &quot; Kyrik Fights the Demon World&quot;, &quot; Kyrik and the Wizard&#x27;s Sword&quot; and &quot;Kyrik and the Lost Queen&quot;.

&quot;Kothar and the Conjurer&#x27;s Curse&quot; was adapted by Marvel Comics as a six-part Conan story, loosely following Fox&#x27;s plot but with Conan replacing Kothar, starting with &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; #46 (&quot;The Curse of the Conjurer&quot;, Jan. 1975). The story was produced by scripter Roy Thomas and artists John Buscema, Joe Sinnott, Dan Adkins, and Dick Giordano.

==Comics==

===Golden Age===

Fox&#x27;s earliest stories for DC Comics featured the fictional district attorney Speed Saunders with art by Creig Flessel and later Fred Guardineer beginning at least with &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #4 (June 1937). Speed Saunders was initially credited to &quot;E.C. Stoner,&quot; which many believe to be a Fox pseudonym, and Fox has gone on record as claiming he created the character, &quot;cashing in on my law school work&quot;. As the 1930s progressed, Fox added writing credits for Steve Malone and Bruce Nelson for &quot;Detective Comics&quot; to his workload, as well as Zatara for early issues of &quot;Action Comics&quot;.

During World War II, Fox assumed responsibility for a variety of characters and books of several of his colleagues who had been drafted. He worked for numerous companies including Marvel Comics&#x27; 1940s predecessor, Timely Comics; Vin Sullivan&#x27;s Magazine Enterprises, Columbia Comics where he created Skyman; and at EC, where he served a brief stint as chief writer. With the waning popularity of superheroes, Fox contributed western, science fiction, humor, romance, and talking animal stories.

====Batman====

During July 1939, just two issues after the debut of the character Batman by artist Bob Kane and scripter Bill Finger, Fox wrote the first of his several tales for that character, introducing an early villain in the story &quot;The Batman Meets Doctor Death&quot;. Alongside Kane and Finger, Fox contributed to the evolution of the character, including the character&#x27;s first use of his utility belt, which &quot;contain[ed] choking gas capsules,&quot; as well as writing the first usages of both the Batarang and the Batgyro, an autogyro precursor to the Batcopter, two issues later.

Fox returned to the Batman in 1964. 

====Sandman====

During 1939, Fox and artist Bert Christman co-created the character of the Sandman, a gasmask-wearing costumed crime-fighter whose first appearance in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #40 (July 1939) was pre-empted by an appearance in &quot;New York World&#x27;s Fair Comics&quot;.

====The Flash====
Fox is credited with writing the first three of six stories in the inaugural issue of &quot;Flash Comics&quot; (Jan. 1940), including the debut of the titular character, The Flash. With a hero described as a &quot;modern-day Mercury&quot;, the title feature saw college student Jay Garrick imbued with superhuman speed after inhaling hard water vapors. The character went on to appear in a host of nineteen-forties comics, including &quot;All Star&quot;, &quot;Comic Cavalcade&quot;, &quot;The Big All-American Comic Book&quot;, &quot;Flash Comics&quot; and his own title, &quot;All-Flash,&quot; so named because, unlike &quot;Flash Comics&quot;, all the stories in it were about The Flash.

====Hawkman====

Describing the origins of Hawkman, Fox recalled, &quot;I was faced with the problem of filling a new book that publisher Max Gaines was starting... As I sat by the window I noticed a bird collecting twigs for a nest. The bird would swoop down, pick up the twig, and fly away. I thought, &#x27;Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if the bird was a lawman and the twig a crook!&#x27;&quot; The character bore a visual resemblance to the Hawkmen who had appeared in the Flash Gordon comic strip in the mid-1930s.

Debuting as the third story in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 (Jan. 1940) — &quot;Fox&#x27;s imagination [transformed] that bird [into] the soaring, mysterious Hawkman.&quot; With art by Dennis Neville, the origin of the &#x27;Winged Wonder&#x27; featured archaeologist and collector Carter Hall reliving his past life as Prince Khufu of ancient Egypt, creating a costume (powered by Nth metal), confronting the reincarnation of Hath-Set, his former nemesis, and meeting his reincarnated love interest, Shiera Saunders.

====The Justice Society of America====

Regularly writing more than six stories in five titles per month, every month throughout the early 1940s, Fox continued to create new features.

At the time, DC Comics consisted of two discrete sub-companies, Max Gaines&#x27; All-American Publications and Harry Donenfeld &amp; Jack Liebowitz&#x27;s National Periodical Publications. Though he continued to script for National/Detective Comics, Inc., Fox became the chief writer for All-American. While Fox&#x27;s Dr. Fate (and other titles) was published by National; Sandman, Hawkman and the Flash were released by All-American. For Winter 1940, the third issue of All-American&#x27;s &quot;All Star Comics&quot; debuted the Justice Society of America, the first superhero team in comics. Fox had worked on the Hawkman, Flash and Sandman features in &quot;All-Star&quot; for its first two issues (Summer and Autumn 1940), but from issue #3 (Winter), he assumed full writing duties for the issue, with all features by different artists working within the framing device wherein the characters were described as part of a &quot;Justice Society&quot;.

In the pages of &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; #3, in collaboration with editor Sheldon Mayer and with artists including E. E. Hibbard, Fox created the first superhero team, the Justice Society of America. Each character – Dr. Fate, the Sandman, the Flash, and Hawkman were joined by Hour-Man, the Spectre, the Atom and Green Lantern – was introduced individually (by Johnny Thunder), and related a solo adventure, before being charged at the title&#x27;s end with remaining a loose team by the Director of the FBI. During April 1941, Fox created the character of Starman with artist Jack Burnley in the pages of &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #61 (April 1941), and the character would later join the JSA. Fox wrote the Justice Society&#x27;s adventures from &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #3 until leaving the feature as of issue #34 (April–May 1947) with a story that introduced a new super-villain, the Wizard.

====Non-DC work====

Between 1940 and 1941, Fox wrote for the Columbia Comic Corporation, penning stories featuring characters including &quot;Face,&quot; &quot;Marvelo,&quot; &quot;Rocky Ryan,&quot; &quot;Skyman,&quot; and &quot;Spymaster.&quot; For approximately three years (1947–1950), Fox wrote for EC Comics, including scripts and text pieces which appeared in the titles &quot;The Crypt of Terror&quot;, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; and &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot;, as well as in the lesser-known &quot;Gunfighter&quot;, &quot;Happy Houlihans&quot;, &quot;Moon Girl&quot;, &quot;Saddle Justice&quot; and the new trend title &quot;Valor&quot;, among others.

Towards the end of the decade, and the start of the 1950s, he worked for Magazine Enterprises on features including &quot;The Durango Kid,&quot; the first Ghost Rider, &quot;Red Hawk,&quot; &quot;Straight Arrow&quot; and &quot;Tim Holt,&quot; in whose comic the Ghost Rider appeared. Fox wrote some of the required text pieces for Magazine Enterprises, which were required by the Post Office to qualify magazines and comics for cheaper postal rates.

Throughout the 1950s, Fox wrote stories for Avon Comics, most notably tales of &quot;Crom the Barbarian&quot;, the first sword and sorcery comic series and of &quot;Kenton of the Star Patrol.&quot;

===Silver Age===

During the early 1950s, Fox wrote Vigilante in &quot;Action Comics&quot;, as well as Western stories in the pages of &quot;Western Comics&quot; and science-fiction stories for DC&#x27;s &quot;Mystery in Space&quot; and &quot;Strange Adventures&quot;. During 1953, he entered into correspondence with fan Jerry Bails, which initially emphasized Bails&#x27; fondness for the Justice Society and &quot;All-Star Comics&quot;, but ultimately became a friendship that not only influenced the beginning of comics&#x27; so-called &quot;Silver Age&quot;, but also comics fandom, in which Bails had a major role.

During the mid-1950s, after Fredric Wertham&#x27;s publication of &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; and the United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency hearings on the dangers of comic books, the content of comics was changed and became subject to censoring by the private Comics Code Authority. In partial response to this shift, DC editor Julius Schwartz began a widespread reinvention/revival of many earlier characters, and &quot;Fox was one of the first writers... Schwartz called in to help&quot;. The Silver Age of Comic Books began in the pages of &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 (Oct. 1956) with a radically changed Flash character by writers Robert Kanigher and John Broome with penciler Carmine Infantino.

Fox scripted most of the Silver Age adventures of science-fiction hero Adam Strange, who debuted in the comic book &quot;Showcase&quot; #17 (Nov. 1958) with art by Mike Sekowsky. The Adam Strange stories were co-plotted by Fox and the character&#x27;s creator, Julius Schwartz. With the &quot;creative guidance&quot; of Fox and Schwartz, &quot;Hawkman and the Atom were given new costumes, new identities,&quot; and drew an audience of fans old and new. Fox penned the reinvention of the new Hawkman in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #34 (March 1961) and the Atom, who debuted in &quot;Showcase&quot; #34 (Sep–Oct. 1961) with art by Gil Kane.

====Justice League of America====

Another of Fox&#x27;s major achievements was his revival of the concept of the Justice Society as the Justice League of America, debuting in the comic book &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #28 (Feb.–Mar. 1960). Soon given their own title during Oct.–Nov. 1960, the Justice League would become the basis of the DC Universe. The supervillain Doctor Light first battled the team in issue #12 (June 1962). &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #21 and #22 (August–September 1963) featured the first team-up of the Justice League and the Justice Society of America as well as the first use of the term &quot;Crisis&quot; in reference to a crossover between characters. The next year&#x27;s team-up with the Justice Society introduced the threat of the Crime Syndicate of America of Earth-Three. The character Zatanna, introduced by Fox and artist Murphy Anderson in &quot;Hawkman&quot; #4 (Nov. 1964), was the center of a plotline which ran through several DC titles and was resolved in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #51 (Feb. 1967). Fox and Sekowsky were the creative team for the title&#x27;s first eight years. Sekowsky&#x27;s last issue was #63 (June 1968) and Fox departed with #65 (September 1968).

====Multiverse====
Fox&#x27;s script for &quot;Flash of Two Worlds!&quot;, from &quot;The Flash&quot; #123 (Sept. 1961), introduced the concept that the Golden Age heroes existed on a parallel Earth named Earth-Two, as the current Flash, Barry Allen, travels to the Earth of Jay Garrick, the 1940s Flash. This event heralded more generally the concept of the DC Comics Multiverse, a decades-long recurring theme of the DC Comics universe, allowing old and new heroes to co-exist and crossover.

In a mischievous twist, Gardner Fox is actually referenced in the story—in Barry Allen&#x27;s world, the adventures of Jay Garrick&#x27;s Flash appeared in comic books written by Fox. As Barry explains, &quot;A writer named Gardner Fox wrote about your adventures -- which he claimed came to him in dreams! Obviously when Fox was asleep, his mind was &#x27;tuned in&#x27; on your vibratory Earth! That explains how he &#x27;dreamed up&#x27; the Flash!&quot; At the end of the story, Barry says, &quot;I&#x27;m going to look up Gardner Fox, who wrote the original Flash stories, and tell it to him! He can write the whole thing up... in a comic book!&quot;

====Silver Age Batman====
During 1964, Schwartz was made responsible for reviving the Batman titles and Fox returned to writing Batman stories. Obeying the Silver Age trends, he reintroduced characters including the Riddler and the Scarecrow. Fox&#x27;s &quot;Remarkable Ruse of the Riddler&quot; with art by Sheldon Moldoff in &quot;Batman&quot; #171 (May 1965). Eighteen issues later, Fox and Moldoff similarly resuscitated and relocated Professor Jonathan Crane, launching the Earth-1 Scarecrow in &quot;Fright of the Scarecrow&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; #189 (Feb 1967). He and artist Carmine Infantino created the Blockbuster in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #345 (Nov. 1965) and the Cluemaster in issue #351 (May 1966). Fox and Infantino introduced Barbara Gordon as a new version of Batgirl in a story titled &quot;The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #359 (January 1967). Fox&#x27;s final Batman story, &quot;Whatever Will Happen to Heiress Heloise?&quot;, was published in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #384 (Feb. 1969).

===Leaving DC===
Fox stopped receiving work from DC during 1968, when the comics company refused to give health insurance and other benefits to its older creators. Fox, who had written a number of historical adventure, mystery and science fiction novels during the 1940s and the 1950s, began to produce novels full time, using his own name and several pseudonyms. He produced a small number of comics during this period, but predominantly produced novels, writing more than 100 in genres such as science fiction, espionage, crime, fantasy, romance, western, and historical fiction.

Among his output was the modern novelisation of the Irwin Allen production of &quot;Jules Verne&#x27;s Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot;, two books of the &quot;Llarn&quot; series; five books about the barbarian swordsman Kothar, starting during 1969 with the anthology &quot;Kothar—Barbarian Swordsman&quot;, and four books about the adventures of &quot;Kyrik,&quot; starting with &quot;Warlock Warrior&quot; (1975).

For Tower Books, Belmont Books, and Belmont-Tower, he produced between thirteen and twenty-five &quot;Lady from L.U.S.T.&quot; (League of Undercover Spies and Terrorists) novels between 1968 and 1975 using the name Rod Gray. (see also: &quot;The Man from O.R.G.Y.&quot;) With Rochelle Larkin and Leonard Levinson, Fox used the pen-name &quot;Glen Chase&quot; to write entries in the &quot;Cherry Delight, The Sexecutioner&quot; series.

===Later comics work===
During the early 1970s, Fox briefly worked for DC&#x27;s rival publisher, Marvel Comics, writing scripts for &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;, &quot;Red Wolf&quot;, and the &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; feature in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot;. During 1971, Skywald Publications reprinted some of his earlier work in titles such as &quot;Demona&quot;, &quot;Nightmare&quot;, &quot;Red Mask&quot; and &quot;Zanagar&quot;, and Fox also found work with Warren Publications on &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot; during the same period.

Towards the end of his life, during 1985, he worked briefly for Eclipse Comics including on the science fiction anthology &quot;Alien Encounters&quot;.

Fox died on December 24, 1986. He died at Princeton Medical Center in Princeton, New Jersey from pneumonia. He is interred in Holy Cross Burial Park and Mausoleum in East Brunswick, New Jersey, alongside his wife Lynda.

==Hobbies and achievements==
During the course of his career, Fox can be definitely credited with about 1500 stories for DC Comics, making him the second most prolific DC creator (after Robert Kanigher) by a considerable margin over his nearest rival. In July 1971, Fox estimated he had written &quot;[f]ifty million words&quot; over the course of his career to date.

He was a member of a number of literary and genre organisations, including the Academy of Comic Book Arts, the Authors Guild, the Authors League of America, and the Science Fiction Writers of America. As a lawyer, he was a member of the legal fraternity Phi Delta Phi.

A sports fan, he liked both &quot;the Mets and the Jets,&quot; and (during 1971) had &quot;season tickets to the St. John&#x27;s games.&quot; He enjoyed making and collecting miniature soldiers, focusing on ancient and medieval figures. A voracious reader, he stated, &quot;I have two writers that I reread and reread. One that I&#x27;m sure nobody&#x27;s every heard of is Jeffery Pond . I have every book he ever wrote. The other is the mystery writer John Dickson Carr, whose style I admire tremendously... and of course the old standbys – Merritt I always particularly liked – and Burroughs.&quot;

===Awards===
Fox won two 1962 Alley Awards – for Best Script Writer and for Best Book-Length Story (&quot;The Planet that Came to a Standstill&quot; in &quot;Mystery in Space&quot; #75), with penciler Carmine Infantino — as well as a 1963 Alley, for Favorite Novel (&quot;Crisis on Earths 1 and 2&quot; in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #21–22, with penciler Mike Sekowsky), and the 1965 Alley for Best Novel (&quot;Solomon Grundy Goes on a Rampage&quot; in &quot;Showcase&quot; #55) with penciler Murphy Anderson.

He was honored at the New York Comic Art Convention during 1971. During 1982, at Skycon II, he was awarded the &quot;Jules Verne Award for Life-time achievement.&quot;

==Legacy==
During 1967, Fox&#x27;s literary agent, August Lenniger, suggested that Fox donate his notes, correspondence, and samples of his work to the University of Oregon as a tax deduction. Fox donated over fourteen boxes of comics, books, scripts, plot ideas, and fan letters dating back to the 1940s. His records comprise the bulk of the university&#x27;s Fox Collection.

The Guy Gardner character is named after Fox. During 1985, DC Comics named Fox as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.

During 1998, he was posthumously awarded a Harvey Award and entered into the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame; a year later, he was inducted into the Eisner Award Hall of Fame.

During 2007, Fox was one of the year&#x27;s two recipients of the Bill Finger Award for Excellence in Comic Book Writing, given under the auspices of San Diego Comic-Con.

During 2002, the Cartoon Network broadcast an episode of the &quot;Justice League&quot; animated TV series titled &quot;Legends&quot;, an homage to Fox&#x27;s Justice Society and his annual Silver Age Justice Society/Justice League crossovers. The episode was dedicated to Fox. Additionally, in the episode titled &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, a TV news reporter refers to Hurricane Gardner.

In the sixth episode of the second season of &quot;Young Justice&quot;, during a disaster which destroys part of the city, the Flash directs a woman to a homeless shelter that is located between streets named Gardner and Fox.

<text>Fenian Ram is a submarine designed by John Philip Holland for use by the Fenian Brotherhood, the American counterpart to the Irish Republican Brotherhood, against the British. The Fenian Ram was the world&#x27;s first practical submarine. It was powered by a double acting Brayton Ready Motor which used kerosene fuel. It was able to dive and submerge successfully. The &quot;Ram&quot;&#x27;s construction and launching in 1881 by the Delamater Iron Company in New York was funded by the Fenians&#x27; Skirmishing Fund. Officially Holland Boat No. II, the role of the Fenians in its funding led the New York Sun newspaper to name the vessel the &quot;Fenian Ram&quot;.

==Design==
&quot;Fenian Ram&quot;&#x27;s design was partly modelled on the Whitehead torpedo, and it had similar cruciform control fins near the tail. The boat did not simply take on ballast until she sank like other contemporary submarines; she maintained a slightly positive buoyancy, and tilted her horizontal planes so that her forward motion forced her under.

&quot;Fenian Ram&quot; was armed with a pneumatic gun some long, mounted along the boat&#x27;s centerline and firing forward out of her bow. It operated like modern submarine torpedo tubes: a watertight bow cap was normally kept shut, allowing the dynamite-filled steel projectiles to be loaded into the tube from the interior of the submarine. The inner door was then shut and the outer door opened by a remote mechanism. Finally, air was used to shoot the projectile out of the tube. To reload, the outer door was again shut and the water in the tube was blown into the surrounding ballast tank by more compressed air. It was powered by a Brayton piston engine.

==Ship history==

During extensive trials, Holland made numerous dives and test-fired the gun using dummy projectiles. However, due to funding disputes within the IRB and disagreement over payments from the IRB to Holland, the IRB stole &quot; Fenian Ram&quot; and the &quot;Holland III&quot; prototype in November 1883. Although &quot;Holland III&quot; accidentally sank in the East River, the Fenians took the &quot;Fenian Ram&quot; to New Haven, Connecticut, but discovered that no one knew how to operate it. Holland refused to help. Unable to use or sell the boat, the Brotherhood had the &quot;Ram&quot; hauled into a shed on the Mill River.

In 1916, &quot;Fenian Ram&quot; was exhibited in Madison Square Garden to raise funds for victims of the Easter Rising. Afterwards, she was moved to Clason Point Military Academy, Bronx, NY. In 1927, the Academy relocated to Long Island and the hull was sold for scrap. Prior to demolition, Irish-American activist Harry Cunningham intervened and purchased the &quot;Fenian Ram&quot; from the junkyard in order to preserve it as a symbol of Irish-American ingenuity. In September, 1927, Cunningham sold the submarine to Edward Browne of Paterson, NJ, who offered the vessel to the City of Paterson as a memorial to Holland&#x27;s work. Today, she can still be seen at the Paterson Museum.

Holland started the Holland Torpedo Boat Company in 1896 after the US Navy showed interest in the design.

<text>The Dead Sea Scrolls, also called the Qumran Caves Scrolls, are a set of ancient Jewish manuscripts from the Second Temple period. They were discovered over a period of 10 years, between 1946 and 1956, at the Qumran Caves near Ein Feshkha in the West Bank, on the northern shore of the Dead Sea. Dating from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE, the Dead Sea Scrolls include the oldest surviving manuscripts of entire books later included in the biblical canons, including deuterocanonical manuscripts from late Second Temple Judaism and extrabiblical books. At the same time, they cast new light on the emergence of Christianity and of Rabbinic Judaism. Almost all of the 15,000 scrolls and scroll fragments are held in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum located in Jerusalem. The Israeli government&#x27;s custody of the Dead Sea Scrolls is disputed by Jordan and the Palestinian Authority on territorial, legal, and humanitarian grounds—they were mostly discovered following the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank and were acquired by Israel after Jordan lost the 1967 Arab–Israeli War—whilst Israel&#x27;s claims are primarily based on historical and religious grounds, given their significance in Jewish history and in the heritage of Judaism.

Many thousands of written fragments have been discovered in the Dead Sea area. They represent the remnants of larger manuscripts damaged by natural causes or through human interference, with the vast majority holding only small scraps of text. However, a small number of well-preserved and nearly intact manuscripts have survived—fewer than a dozen among those from the Qumran Caves. Researchers have assembled a collection of 981 different manuscripts (discovered in 1946/1947 and in 1956) from 11 caves, which lie in the immediate vicinity of the Hellenistic Jewish settlement at the site of Khirbet Qumran in the eastern Judaean Desert in the West Bank. The caves are located about west of the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, whence the scrolls derive their name. Archaeologists have long associated the scrolls with the ancient Jewish sect known as the Essenes, although some recent interpretations have challenged this connection and argue that priests in Jerusalem or other unknown Jewish groups wrote the scrolls.

Most of the manuscripts are written in Hebrew, with some written in Aramaic (for example the Son of God Text; in different regional dialects, including Nabataean) and a few in Greek. Other discoveries from the Judaean Desert add Latin (from Masada), and some later Arabic manuscripts from the 7th-8th centuries CE (from Khirbet al-Mird). Most of the texts are written on parchment, some on papyrus, and one on copper. Though scholarly consensus dates the Dead Sea Scrolls to between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century CE, there are Arabic manuscripts from associated Judaean Desert sites that are dated between the 8th and 10th century CE. Bronze coins found at the same sites form a series beginning with John Hyrcanus, a ruler of the Hasmonean Kingdom (in office 135–104 BCE), and continuing until the period of the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE), supporting the paleography and radiocarbon dating of the scrolls.

Owing to the poor condition of some of the scrolls, scholars have not identified all of their texts. The identified texts fall into three general groups:
# About 40% are copies of texts from Hebrew scriptures.
# Approximately 30% are texts from the Second Temple period that ultimately were not canonized in the Hebrew Bible, such as the Book of Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, the Book of Tobit, the Wisdom of Sirach, Psalms 152–155, etc.
# The remainder (roughly 30%) are sectarian manuscripts of previously unknown documents that shed light on the rules and beliefs of a particular sect or groups within greater Judaism, such as the Community Rule, the War Scroll, the Pesher on Habakkuk, and The Rule of the Blessing.

==Discovery==

The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in a series of 12 caves around the site originally known as Ein Feshkha near the Dead Sea in the West Bank (then controlled by Jordan) between 1946 and 1956 by Bedouin shepherds and a team of archaeologists. The practice of storing worn-out sacred manuscripts in earthenware vessels buried in the earth or within caves is related to the ancient Jewish custom of genizah.

===Initial discovery (1946–1947)===
The initial discovery by Bedouin shepherd Muhammed edh-Dhib, his cousin Jum&#x27;a Muhammed, and Khalil Musa took place between November 1946 and February 1947. The shepherds discovered seven scrolls housed in jars in a cave near what is now known as the Qumran site. John C. Trever reconstructed the story of the scrolls from several interviews with the Bedouins. Edh-Dhib&#x27;s cousin noticed the caves, but edh-Dhib was the first to actually fall into one (the cave now called Cave 1). He retrieved a handful of scrolls, which Trever identifies as the Isaiah Scroll, Habakkuk Commentary, and the Community Rule, and took them back to the camp to show to his family. None of the scrolls were destroyed in this process. The Bedouins kept the scrolls hanging on a tent pole while they contemplated what they should do with them, periodically showing the scrolls to their people. At some point during this time, the Community Rule was split in two. The Bedouins first took the scrolls to a dealer named Ibrahim &#x27;Ijha in Bethlehem. &#x27;Ijha returned them, saying they were worthless, after being warned that they might have been stolen from a synagogue. Undaunted, the Bedouins went to a nearby market, where a Syrian Christian offered to buy them. A sheikh joined their conversation and suggested that they take the scrolls to Khalil Eskander Shahin, &quot;Kando&quot;, a cobbler and part-time antiques dealer. The Bedouins and the dealers returned to the site, leaving one scroll with Kando and selling three others to a dealer for seven Jordanian pounds (approximately $28, or $ in dollars). The original scrolls continued to change hands after the Bedouins left them in the possession of a third party until a sale could be arranged. 

In 1947 the original seven scrolls caught the attention of Trever of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), who compared the script in the scrolls to the Nash Papyrus, the oldest biblical manuscript then known, and found similarities between them. In March the 1948 Arab–Israeli War prompted the move of some of the scrolls to Beirut, Lebanon, for safekeeping. On 11 April 1948, Millar Burrows, head of the ASOR, announced the discovery of the scrolls in a general press release.

===Search for the Qumran caves (1948–1949)===
Early in September 1948, Metropolitan bishop Mar Samuel brought some additional scroll fragments that he had acquired to professor Ovid R. Sellers, the succeeding director of ASOR. By the end of 1948, nearly two years after the discovery of the scrolls, scholars had yet to locate the original cave where the fragments had been found. With unrest in the country at that time, no large-scale search could be safely undertaken. Sellers tried to persuade the Syrians to assist in the search for the cave, but he was unable to pay their price. In early 1949, the government of Jordan granted permission to the Arab Legion to search the area in which the original Qumran cave was believed to exist. Consequently, Cave 1 was rediscovered on 28 January 1949 by Belgian United Nations observer captain Phillipe Lippens and Arab Legion captain Akkash el-Zebn.

===Qumran caves rediscovery and new scroll discoveries (1949–1951)===
The rediscovery of what became known as Cave 1 at Qumran prompted the initial excavation of the site from 15 February to 5 March 1949 by the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, led by Gerald Lankester Harding and Roland de Vaux. The Cave 1 site yielded discoveries of additional Dead Sea Scroll fragments, linen cloth, jars, and other artefacts.

===Excavations of Qumran and new cave discoveries (1951–1956, 2017, 2021)===
In November 1951, de Vaux and his team from the ASOR began a full excavation of Qumran. By February 1952, the Bedouins had discovered 30 fragments in what was to be designated Cave 2. The discovery of a second cave eventually yielded 300 fragments from 33 manuscripts, including fragments of Jubilees and the Wisdom of Sirach written in Hebrew. The following month, on 14 March 1952, the ASOR team discovered a third cave with fragments of Jubilees and the Copper Scroll. Between September and December 1952, the fragments and scrolls of Caves 4, 5, and 6 were discovered by the ASOR teams.

With the monetary value of the scrolls rising as their historical significance was made more public, the Bedouins and the ASOR archaeologists accelerated their search for the scrolls separately in the same general area of Qumran, which was more than one kilometre in length. Between 1953 and 1956, de Vaux led four more archaeological expeditions in the area to uncover scrolls and artefacts. Cave 11 was discovered in 1956 and yielded the last fragments to be found in the vicinity of Qumran.

Caves 4–10 are clustered in an area lying in relative proximity from Khirbet Qumran, while caves 1, 2, 3 and 11 are located 1 mile (1–2 kilometres) north, with Cave 3 the most remote. In February 2017, Hebrew University archaeologists announced the discovery of a new 12th cave. There was one blank parchment found in a jar, but broken and empty scroll jars and pickaxes suggest that the cave was looted in the 1950s.

In March 2021, Israeli archaeologists announced the discovery of dozens of fragments bearing biblical text, written in Greek, from the books of Zechariah and Nahum. This group of findings is believed to have been hidden in a cave between 132 and 136 CE during the Bar Kokhba revolt. However, a 10,500-year-old basket made of woven reeds was also discovered in the Muraba&#x27;at caves in the Nahal Darga Reserve. Other discoveries included the remains of a child wrapped in cloth dated to around 6,000 years ago, and a cache of coins from the days of the Bar Kochba revolt. In 2021, more scrolls were discovered by Israeli authorities in a different cave near the Dead Sea called the Cave of Horrors.

==Caves and their contents==
The 972 manuscripts found at Qumran were found primarily in two separate formats: as scrolls and as fragments of previous scrolls and texts. In the fourth cave the fragments were torn into up to 15,000 pieces. These small fragments created somewhat of a problem for scholars. G.L. Harding, director of the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, began working on piecing the fragments together but did not finish this before his death in 1979.

; Cave 1
Wadi Qumran Cave 1 was discovered for the first time in 1946. The original seven Dead Sea Scrolls from Cave 1 are the Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa), a second copy of Isaiah (1QIsa), the Community Rule Scroll (1QS), the Pesher on Habakkuk (1QpHab), the War Scroll (1QM), the Thanksgiving Hymns (1QH), and the Genesis Apocryphon (1QapGen). One of the pottery jars containing the scrolls from Cave 1 is now kept in the British Museum.

; Cave 2
Wadi Qumran Cave 2 was discovered in February 1952 in which the Bedouins discovered 30 fragments. The cave eventually yielded 300 fragments from 33 manuscripts of Dead Sea Scrolls, including fragments of Jubilees and the Wisdom of Sirach written in Hebrew.

; Cave 3
Wadi Qumran Cave 3 was discovered on 14 March 1952 by the ASOR team. The cave initially yielded fragments of Jubilees and the Copper Scroll.

; Caves 4a and 4b

Wadi Qumran Cave 4 was discovered in August 1952 and was excavated from 22–29 September 1952 by Harding, de Vaux, and Józef Milik. Cave 4 is actually two hand-cut caves (4a and 4b), but since the fragments were mixed they are labelled as 4Q. Cave 4 is the most famous of Qumran caves both because of its visibility from the Qumran plateau and its productivity. It is visible from the plateau to the south of the Qumran settlement. It is by far the most productive of all Qumran caves, producing 90% of the Dead Sea Scrolls and scroll fragments (approx. 15,000 fragments from 500 different texts), including 9–10 copies of Jubilees, along with 21 &quot;tefillin&quot; and 7 &quot;mezuzot&quot;.

; Cave 5
Wadi Qumran Cave 5 was discovered in 1952, shortly after the discovery of Cave 4. Cave 5 produced approximately 25 manuscripts.

; Cave 6
Wadi Qumran Cave 6 was discovered alongside Cave 5 in 1952, shortly after the discovery of Cave 4. Cave 6 contained fragments of about 31 manuscripts.

; Cave 7
Wadi Qumran Cave 7 yielded fewer than 20 fragments of Greek documents, including 7Q2 (the &quot;Letter of Jeremiah&quot; = Baruch 6), 7Q5 (which became the subject of much speculation in later decades), and a Greek copy of a scroll of Enoch. Cave 7 also produced several inscribed potsherds and jars.

; Cave 8

Wadi Qumran Cave 8, along with caves 7 and 9, is one of the only caves that are accessible by passing through the settlement at Qumran. Carved into the southern end of the Qumran plateau, cave 8 was excavated by archaeologists in 1957. Cave 8 produced five fragments: Genesis (8QGen), Psalms (8QPs), a tefillin fragment (8QPhyl), a mezuzah (8QMez), and a hymn (8QHymn). Cave 8 also produced several tefillin cases, a box of leather objects, many lamps, jars, and the sole of a leather shoe.

; Cave 9
Wadi Qumran Cave 9, along with caves 7 and 8, was one of the only caves that are accessible by passing through the settlement at Qumran. Carved into the southern end of the Qumran plateau, Cave 9 was excavated by archaeologists in 1957. There was only one manuscript fragment found in Cave 9.

; Cave 10
In Qumran Cave 10 archaeologists found two ostraca with writing on them, along with an unknown symbol on a grey stone slab.

; Cave 11
Wadi Qumran Cave 11 was discovered in 1956 and yielded 21 texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls, some of which were quite lengthy. The Temple Scroll, so called because more than half of it pertains to the construction of the Temple of Jerusalem, was found in Cave 11 and is by far the longest scroll. It is 26.7 feet (8.15 m) long; its original length may have been over 28 feet (8.75 m). The Temple Scroll was regarded by scholar Yigael Yadin as &quot;The Torah According to the Essenes&quot;. On the other hand, Hartmut Stegemann, a contemporary and friend of Yadin, believes the scroll was not to be regarded as such but was a document without exceptional significance. Stegemann notes that it is not mentioned or cited in any known Essene writing.

An eschatological fragment about the biblical figure Melchizedek (11Q13) was found in Cave 11. Cave 11 also produced a copy of Jubilees, and a proto-Masoteric text of the Torah scroll (only a fragment of the Book of Leviticus surviving), known as the Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus Scroll. According to former chief editor of the Dead Sea Scrolls editorial team John Strugnell, there are at least four privately owned scrolls from Cave 11 that have not yet been made available for scholars. Among them is a complete Aramaic manuscript of the Book of Enoch.

; Cave 12
Cave 12 was discovered in February 2017 on cliffs west of Qumran, near the north-western shore of the Dead Sea. Archaeological examination found pickaxes and empty broken scroll jars, indicating that the cave had been discovered and looted in the 1950s. One of the joint Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Liberty University project&#x27;s lead researchers, Oren Gutfeld, stated, &quot;Although at the end of the day no scroll was found, and instead we &#x27;only&#x27; found a piece of parchment rolled up in a jug that was being processed for writing, the findings indicate beyond any doubt that the cave contained scrolls that were stolen.&quot;

; Fragments with unknown provenance
Some fragments of scrolls have neither significant archaeological provenance nor records that reveal in which designated Qumran cave area they were found. They are believed to have come from Wadi Qumran caves but are just as likely to have come from other archaeological sites in the Judaean Desert area. These fragments have therefore been designated to the temporary &quot;X&quot; series.

==Origin==
There has been much debate about the origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The dominant theory remains that the scrolls were produced by the Essenes, a sect of Jews living at nearby Qumran, but this theory has come to be challenged by several modern scholars.

===Qumran–Essene theory===
The view among scholars, almost universally held until the 1990s, is the &quot;Qumran–Essene&quot; hypothesis originally posited by Roland Guérin de Vaux and Józef Tadeusz Milik, though independently both Eliezer Sukenik and Butrus Sowmy of St Mark&#x27;s Monastery connected scrolls with the Essenes well before any excavations at Qumran. The Qumran–Essene theory holds that the scrolls were written by the Essenes or by another Jewish sectarian group residing at Khirbet Qumran. They composed the scrolls and ultimately hid them in the nearby caves during the Jewish Revolt sometime between 66 and 68 CE. The site of Qumran was destroyed and the scrolls never recovered. Arguments supporting this theory include:
* There are striking similarities between the description of an initiation ceremony of new members in the Community Rule and descriptions of the Essene initiation ceremony mentioned in the works of Flavius Josephus, a Jewish-Roman historian of the Second Temple period.
* Josephus mentioned the Essenes as sharing property among the members of the community, as does the Community Rule.
* During the excavation of Khirbet Qumran, two inkwells and plastered elements thought to be tables were found, offering evidence that some form of writing was done there. More inkwells were discovered nearby. De Vaux called this area the &quot;scriptorium&quot; based upon this discovery.
* Several Jewish ritual baths (Hebrew: ) were discovered at Qumran, offering evidence of an observant Jewish presence at the site.
* Pliny the Elder (a geographer writing after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE) described a group of Essenes living in a desert community on the northwest shore of the Dead Sea near the ruined town of &#x27;Ein Gedi.

===Qumran–Sectarian theory===
Qumran–Sectarian theories are variations on the Qumran–Essene theory. The main point of departure from the Qumran–Essene theory is hesitation to link the Dead Sea Scrolls specifically with the Essenes. Most proponents of the Qumran–Sectarian theory posit a group of Jews living in or near Qumran were responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls but do not necessarily conclude that the sectarians were Essenes.

A specific variation on the Qumran–Sectarian theory emerged in the 1990s that has gained much recent popularity is the work of Lawrence H. Schiffman, who proposes that the community was led by a group of Zadokite priests (Sadducees). The most important document in support of this view is the &quot;Miqsat Ma&#x27;ase Ha-Torah&quot; (4QMMT), which cites purity laws (such as the transfer of impurities) identical to those attributed in rabbinic writings to the Sadducees. 4QMMT also reproduces a festival calendar that follows Sadducee principles for the dating of certain festival days.

===Christian origin theory===
Spanish Jesuit José O&#x27;Callaghan Martínez argued in the 1960s that one fragment (7Q5) preserves a portion of text from the New Testament Gospel of Mark 6:52–53. This theory was scrutinized in the year 2000 by paleographic analysis of the particular fragment. However, this faced some contention, and O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s theory remains an area of great dispute. Later analyses in 2004 and 2018 lent credence to O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s original assertion.

Robert Eisenman has advanced the theory that some scrolls describe the early Christian community. Eisenman also argues that the careers of James the Just and Paul the Apostle correspond to events recorded in some of these documents.

===Jerusalem origin theory===
Some scholars have argued that the scrolls were the product of Jews living in Jerusalem who hid the scrolls in the caves near Qumran while fleeing from the Romans during the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Karl Heinrich Rengstorf first proposed in the 1960s that the Dead Sea Scrolls originated at the library of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. Later, Norman Golb suggested that the scrolls were the product of multiple libraries in Jerusalem and not necessarily the Jerusalem Temple library. Proponents of the Jerusalem origin theory point to the diversity of thought and handwriting among the scrolls as evidence against a Qumran origin of the scrolls. Several archaeologists have also accepted an origin of the scrolls other than Qumran, including Yizhar Hirschfeld and more recently Yizhak Magen and Yuval Peleg, who all understand the remains of Qumran to be those of a Hasmonean fort that was reused during later periods.

==Physical characteristics==
===Radiocarbon dating===

Parchment from a number of the Dead Sea Scrolls has been carbon dated. The initial test performed in 1950 was on a piece of linen from one of the caves. This test gave an indicative dating of 33 CE plus or minus 200 years, eliminating early hypotheses relating the scrolls to the Medieval period. Since then two large series of tests have been performed on the scrolls. The results were summarized by VanderKam and Flint, who said the tests give &quot;strong reason for thinking that most of the Qumran manuscripts belong to the last two centuries BCE and the first century CE.&quot;

===Paleographic dating===
Analysis of letter forms, or palaeography, was applied to the texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls by a variety of scholars in the field. Major linguistic analysis by Cross and Avigad dates fragments from 225 BCE to 50 CE. These dates were determined by examining the size, variability, and style of the text. The same fragments were later analysed using radiocarbon dating and were dated to an estimated range of 385 BCE to 82 CE with a 68% accuracy rate.

===Ink and parchment===
The scrolls were analysed using a cyclotron at the University of California, Davis, where it was found that all black ink was carbon black. The red ink on the scrolls was found to be made with cinnabar (HgS, mercury sulfide). There are only four uses of this red ink in the entire collection of Dead Sea Scroll fragments. The black inks found on the scrolls are mostly made of carbon soot from olive oil lamps. Honey, oil, vinegar, and water were often added to the mixture to thin the ink to a proper consistency for writing. Galls were sometimes added to the ink to make it more resilient. In order to apply the ink to the scrolls, its writers used reed pens.

The Dead Sea Scrolls were written on parchment made of processed animal hide known as vellum (approximately 85.5–90.5% of the scrolls), papyrus (estimated at 8–13% of the scrolls), and sheets of bronze composed of about 99% copper and 1% tin (approximately 1.5% of the scrolls). For those scrolls written on animal hides, scholars with the Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA), by use of DNA testing for assembly purposes, believe that there may be a hierarchy in the religious importance of the texts based on which type of animal was used to create the hide. Scrolls written on goat and calf hides are considered by scholars to be more significant in nature, while those written on gazelle or ibex are considered to be less religiously significant in nature.

Tests by the National Institute of Nuclear Physics in Sicily have suggested that the origin of parchment of select Dead Sea Scroll fragments is from the Qumran area, by using X-ray and particle-induced X-ray emission testing of the water used to make the parchment that were compared with the water from the area aroundQumran.

===Preservation===

The Dead Sea Scrolls that were found were originally preserved by the arid conditions present within the Qumran area adjoining the Dead Sea. In addition, the lack of the use of tanning materials on the parchment of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the very low airflow in the caves also contributed significantly to their preservation. Some of the scrolls were found stored in clay jars, further helping to preserve them from deterioration. The original handling of the scrolls by archaeologists and scholars was done inappropriately, and, along with their storage in an uncontrolled environment, they began a process of more rapid deterioration than they had experienced at Qumran. During the first few years in the late 1940s and early 1950s, adhesive tape used to join fragments and seal cracks caused significant damage to the documents. The government of Jordan had recognized the urgency of protecting the scrolls from deterioration and the presence of the deterioration among the scrolls. However, the government did not have adequate funds to purchase all the scrolls for their protection and agreed to have foreign institutions purchase the scrolls and have them held at their museum in Jerusalem until they could be &quot;adequately studied&quot;.

In early 1953, the scrolls were moved to the Palestine Archaeological Museum (commonly called the Rockefeller Museum) in East Jerusalem and through their transportation suffered more deterioration and damage. The museum was underfunded and had limited resources with which to examine the scrolls, and as a result conditions of the &quot;scrollery&quot; and storage area were left relatively uncontrolled by modern standards. The museum had left most of the fragments and scrolls lying between window glass, trapping the moisture in with them, causing an acceleration in the deterioration process. During the Suez Crisis the scrolls collection of the Palestine Archaeological Museum was stored in the vault of the Ottoman Bank in Amman, Jordan. Damp conditions from temporary storage of the scrolls in the Ottoman Bank vault from 1956 to 1957 led to a more rapid rate of deterioration of the scrolls. The conditions caused mildew to develop on the scrolls and fragments, and some fragments were partially destroyed or made illegible by the glue and paper of the manila envelopes in which they were stored while in the vault. By 1958 it was noted that up to 5% of some of the scrolls had completely deteriorated. Many of the texts had become illegible, and many of the parchments had darkened considerably.

Until the 1970s, the scrolls continued to deteriorate because of poor storage arrangements, exposure to different adhesives, and being stored in moist environments. Fragments written on parchment (rather than papyrus or bronze) in the hands of private collectors and scholars suffered an even worse fate than those in the hands of the museum, with large portions of fragments being reported to have disappeared by 1966. In the late 1960s, the deterioration was becoming a major concern with scholars and museum officials alike. Scholars John Allegro and Sir Francis Frank were among the first to strongly advocate for better preservation techniques. Early attempts made by both the British and Israel museums to remove the adhesive tape ended up exposing the parchment to an array of chemicals, including &quot;British Leather Dressing,&quot; and darkening some of them significantly. In the 1970s and 1980s, other preservation attempts were made that included removing the glass plates and replacing them with cardboard and removing pressure against the plates that held the scrolls in storage; however, the fragments and scrolls continued to rapidly deteriorate during this time.

In 1991, the IAA established a temperature-controlled laboratory for the storage and preservation of the scrolls. The actions and preservation methods of Rockefeller Museum staff were concentrated on the removal of tape, oils, metals, salt, and other contaminants. The fragments and scrolls are preserved using acid-free cardboard and stored in solander boxes in the climate-controlled storage area. Nine tiny tefellin strips were rediscovered by the IAA in 2014, after they had been stored unopened for six decades following their excavation in 1952.

==Photography and assembly==
Since the Dead Sea Scrolls were initially held by different parties during and after the excavation process, they were not all photographed by the same organization.

===First photographs (1948)===
The first individual to photograph a portion of the collection was Trever, who was a resident for the American Schools of Oriental Research. He photographed three of the scrolls discovered in Cave 1 on 21 February 1948, both on black-and-white and color film. Although an amateur photographer, the quality of his photographs often exceeded the visibility of the scrolls themselves as, over the years, the ink of the texts quickly deteriorated after they were removed from their linen wrappings.

===Infrared photography and plate assembly (1952–1967)===
A majority of the collection from the Qumran caves was acquired by the Palestine Archaeological Museum. The museum had the scrolls photographed by Najib Albina, a local Arab photographer trained by Lewis Larsson of the American Colony in Jerusalem, Between 1952 and 1967, Albina documented the five-stage process of the sorting and assembly of the scrolls, done by the curator and staff of the Palestine Archaeological Museum, using infrared photography. Using a process known today as broadband fluorescence infrared photography, or NIR photography, Najib and the team at the museum produced over 1,750 photographic plates of the scrolls and fragments. The photographs were taken with the scrolls laid out on animal skin using large format film, which caused the text to stand out, making the plates especially useful for assembling fragments. These are the earliest photographs of the museum&#x27;s collection, which was the most complete in the world at the time, and they recorded the fragments and scrolls before their further decay in storage, so they are often considered the best recorded copies of the scrolls.

===Digital infrared imaging (1993–2012)===
Beginning in 1993, the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used digital infrared imaging technology to produce photographs of Dead Sea Scrolls fragments. In partnership with the Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center and West Semitic Research, NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory successfully worked to expand on the use of infrared photography previously used to evaluate ancient manuscripts by expanding the range of spectra at which images are photographed. 

NASA used multispectral imaging adapted from its remote sensing and planetary probes in order to reveal previously illegible text on the fragments. The process uses a liquid crystal tunable filter in order to photograph the scrolls at specific wavelengths of light and, as a result, image distortion is significantly diminished. This method was used with select fragments to reveal text and details a larger light spectrum could not reveal. The camera and digital imaging assembly were developed specifically for the purpose of photographing illegible ancient texts.

On 18 December 2012 the first output of this project was launched together with Google on the dedicated site &quot;Deadseascrolls.org.il.&quot; The site contains both digitizations of old images taken in the 1950s and about 1,000 images taken with multispectral imaging.

===DNA scroll assembly (2006–2020)===
Scientists with the IAA have used DNA from the parchment on which the fragments were written, in concert with infrared digital photography, to assist in the reassembly of the scrolls. For scrolls written on parchment made from animal hide and papyrus, scientists with the museum are using DNA code to associate fragments with different scrolls and to help scholars determine which scrolls may hold greater significance based on the type of material that was used. In a paper published in 2020 in the journal &quot;Cell&quot;, researchers from Tel Aviv University have shown that DNA extracted from the scrolls can be used to sort different scroll fragments not only based on the animal species but also based on variations in the nuclear genome of individual fragments. This effort enabled the researchers to match different fragments to each other based on their genetics and separate fragments which were falsely connected in the past.

===Digitization project (2011–2016)===
In partnership with Google, the Museum of Jerusalem is working to photograph the Dead Sea Scrolls and make them available to the public digitally, albeit not in the public domain. The lead photographer of the project, Ardon Bar-Hama, and his team are utilizing the Alpa 12 MAX camera accompanied with a Leaf Aptus-II back to produce ultra-high resolution digital images of the scrolls and fragments. With photos taken at 1,200 megapixels, the results are digital images that can be used to distinguish details that are invisible to the naked eye. In order to minimize damage to the scrolls and fragments, photographers are using a 1/4000th of a second exposure time and UV-protected flash tubes. The digital photography project was estimated in 2011 to cost 3.5 million U.S. dollars.

==Scholarly examination==
After most of the scrolls and fragments were moved to the Palestine Archaeological Museum in 1953, scholars began to assemble them and log them for translation and study in a room that became known as the &quot;scrollery&quot;.

The text of the Dead Sea Scrolls is written in four languages: Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Nabataean.

==Publication==
===Physical publication===
Some of the fragments and scrolls were published early. Most of the longer, more complete scrolls were published soon after their discovery. All the writings in Cave 1 appeared in print between 1950 and 1956; those from eight other caves were released in 1963; and in 1965 the Psalms Scroll from Cave 11 was published. Their translations into English soon followed.

Publication of the scrolls has taken many decades, and delays have been a source of academic controversy. The scrolls were controlled by a small group of scholars headed by John Strugnell, while a majority of scholars had access neither to the scrolls nor even to photographs of the text. Scholars such as Norman Golb, publishers and writers such as Hershel Shanks, and many others argued for decades for publishing the texts, so that they become available to researchers. This controversy only ended in 1991, when the Biblical Archaeology Society was able to publish the &quot;Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls&quot;, after an intervention of the Israeli government and the IAA. In 1991 Emanuel Tov was appointed as the chairman of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation, and publication of the scrolls followed in the same year.

The majority of the scrolls consist of tiny, brittle fragments, which were published at a pace considered by many to be excessively slow. During early assembly and translation work by scholars through the Rockefeller Museum from the 1950s through the 1960s, access to the unpublished documents was limited to the editorial committee.

====&quot;Discoveries in the Judaean Desert&quot; (1955–2009)====
The content of the scrolls was published in a 40-volume series by Oxford University Press between 1955 and 2009 known as &quot;Discoveries in the Judaean Desert&quot;. In 1952 the Jordanian Department of Antiquities assembled a team of scholars to begin examining, assembling, and translating the scrolls with the intent of publishing them. The initial publication, assembled by Dominique Barthélemy and Józef Milik, was published as &quot;Qumran Cave 1&quot; in 1955. After a series of other publications in the late 1980s and early 1990s and with the appointment of the respected Dutch-Israeli textual scholar Emanuel Tov as editor-in-chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls Publication Project in 1990 publication of the scrolls accelerated. Tov&#x27;s team had published five volumes covering the Cave 4 documents by 1995. Between 1990 and 2009, Tov helped the team produce 32 volumes. The final volume, Volume XL, was published in 2009.

====&quot;A Preliminary Edition of the Unpublished Dead Sea Scrolls&quot; (1991)====
In 1991, researchers at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio, Ben Zion Wacholder and Martin Abegg, announced the creation of a computer program that used previously published scrolls to reconstruct the unpublished texts. Officials at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, led by head librarian William Andrew Moffett, announced that they would allow researchers unrestricted access to the library&#x27;s complete set of photographs of the scrolls. In the fall of that year, Wacholder published 17 documents that had been reconstructed in 1988 from a concordance and had come into the hands of scholars outside of the international team; in the same month, there occurred the discovery and publication of a complete set of facsimiles of the Cave 4 materials at the Huntington Library. Thereafter, the officials of the IAA agreed to lift their long-standing restrictions on the use of the scrolls.

====&quot;A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls&quot; (1991)====
After further delays, attorney William John Cox undertook representation of an &quot;undisclosed client&quot;, who had provided a complete set of the unpublished photographs, and contracted for their publication. Professors Robert Eisenman and James Robinson indexed the photographs and wrote an introduction to &quot;A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls&quot;, which was published by the Biblical Archaeology Society in 1991. Following the publication of the &quot;Facsimile Edition&quot;, Professor Elisha Qimron sued Hershel Shanks, Eisenman, Robinson and the Biblical Archaeology Society for copyright infringement for publishing without authorization or attribution his decipherment of one of the scrolls, MMT. The District Court of Jerusalem found in favour of Qimron. The court issued a restraining order which prohibited the publication of the deciphered text, and ordered defendants to pay Qimron NIS 100,000 for infringing his copyright and the right of attribution. Defendants appealed the Supreme Court of Israel which approved the district court&#x27;s decision. The Supreme Court further ordered that the defendants hand over to Qimron all the infringing copies. The decision met Israeli and international criticism from copyright law scholars.

====The Facsimile Edition (2007–2008)====
In November 2007 the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation commissioned the London publisher Facsimile Editions Limited to produce a facsimile edition of The Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa), The Order of the Community (1QS), and The Pesher to Habakkuk (1QpHab). The facsimile was produced from 1948 photographs and so more faithfully represents the condition of the Isaiah Scroll at the time of its discovery than does the current condition of the Isaiah Scroll.

Of the first three facsimile sets, one was exhibited at the &quot;Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls&quot; exhibition in Seoul, South Korea, and a second set was purchased by the British Library in London. A further 46 sets including facsimiles of three fragments from Cave 4 (now in the collection of the National Archaeological Museum in Amman, Jordan) Testimonia (4Q175), Pesher Isaiahb (4Q162) and Qohelet (4Q109) were announced in May 2009. The edition is strictly limited to 49 numbered sets of these reproductions on either specially prepared parchment paper or real parchment. The facsimiles have since been exhibited in &quot;Qumrân. Le secret des manuscrits de la mer Morte&quot; at the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, France (2010) and &quot;Verbum Domini&quot; at the Vatican, Rome, Italy (2012).

===Digital publication===
The text of nearly all of the non-biblical scrolls has been recorded and tagged for morphology by Martin Abegg, Jr., the Ben Zion Wacholder Professor of Dead Sea Scroll Studies at Trinity Western University located in Langley, British Columbia, Canada. It is available on handheld devices through Olive Tree Bible Software and Logos Bible Software.

The text of almost all of the non-biblical texts was released on CD-ROM by publisher E.J. Brill in 2005. The 2,400 page, six-volume series, was assembled by an editorial team led by Donald W. Parry and Emanuel Tov. Unlike the text translations in the physical publication, &quot;Discoveries in the Judaean Desert,&quot; the texts are sorted by genres that include religious law, parabiblical texts, calendrical and sapiental texts, and poetic and liturgical works.

On 25 September 2011 the Israel Museum Digital Dead Sea Scrolls site went online. It gives users access to searchable, high-resolution images of the scrolls, as well as short explanatory videos and background information on the texts and their history. , five complete scrolls from the Israel Museum have been digitized for the project and are accessible online: the Great Isaiah Scroll, the Community Rule Scroll, the Commentary on Habakkuk Scroll, the Temple Scroll, and the War Scroll.

==Biblical significance==
Before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest Hebrew-language manuscripts of the Bible were Masoretic texts dating to the 10th century CE, such as the Aleppo Codex. Today, the oldest known extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century. The biblical manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls push that date back more than a millennium to the 2nd century BCE. This was a significant discovery for Old Testament scholars who anticipated that the Dead Sea Scrolls would either affirm or repudiate the reliability of textual transmission from the original texts to the oldest Masoretic texts at hand. The discovery demonstrated the unusual accuracy of transmission over a thousand-year period, rendering it reasonable to believe that current Old Testament texts are reliable copies of the original works.

According to &quot;The Dead Sea Scrolls&quot; by Hebrew scholar Millar Burrows

Of the 166 &quot;words&quot; in Isaiah 53, there are only seventeen &quot;letters&quot; in question. Ten of these letters are simply a matter of spelling, which does not affect the sense. Four more letters are minor stylistic changes, such as conjunctions. The remaining three letters comprise the word &quot;light,&quot; which is added in verse 11, and does not affect the meaning greatly.

Differences were found among fragments of texts. According to &quot;The Oxford Companion to Archaeology&quot;:

The majority of the texts found is non-biblical in nature and were thought to be insignificant for understanding the composition or canonization of the biblical books, but a consensus has emerged which sees many of these works as being collected by the Essene community instead of being composed by them. Scholars now recognize that some of these works were composed earlier than the Essene period, when some of the biblical books were still being written or redacted into their final form.

===Biblical books found===
There are 235 biblical texts, including 10 deuterocanonical books, included in the Dead Sea Scroll documents, or around 22% of the total. The Dead Sea Scrolls contain parts of all but one of the books of the Tanakh of the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament protocanon. They also include four of the deuterocanonical books included in Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles: Tobit, Sirach, Baruch 6 (also known as the Letter or Epistle of Jeremiah), and Psalm 151. The Book of Esther has not yet been found, and scholars believe Esther is missing because, as a Jew, her marriage to a Persian king may have been looked down upon by the inhabitants of Qumran, or because the book has the Purim festival which is not included in the Qumran calendar. 

Listed below are the most represented books, along with the deuterocanonicals, of the Bible found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including the number of translatable Dead Sea texts that represent a copy of scripture from each biblical book:

==Museum exhibitions and displays==

Small portions of the Dead Sea Scrolls collections have been put on temporary display in exhibitions at museums and public venues around the world. The majority of these exhibitions took place in 1965 in the United States and the United Kingdom and from 1993 to 2011 in locations around the world. Many of the exhibitions were co-sponsored by either the Jordanian government (pre-1967) or the Israeli government (post-1967). Exhibitions were discontinued after 1965 due to the Six-Day War conflicts and have slowed down in post-2011 as the IAA works to digitize the scrolls and place them in permanent cold storage.

The majority of the Dead Sea Scrolls collection was moved to Jerusalem&#x27;s Shrine of the Book (a part of the Israel Museum) after the building&#x27;s completion in April 1965. The museum falls under the auspices of the IAA. The permanent exhibition at the museum features a reproduction of the Great Isaiah Scroll, surrounded by reproductions of other fragments that include Community Rule, the War Scroll, and the Thanksgiving Psalms Scroll.

Some of the collection held by the Jordanian government prior to 1967 was stored in Amman rather than at the Palestine Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem. As a consequence, that part of the collection remained in Jordanian hands under their Department of Antiquities. Since 2013, the part of the collection held by Jordan has been on display at The Jordan Museum in Amman. Among the display items are artefacts from the Qumran site and the Copper Scroll.

==Ownership==
Upon their discovery in 1947 in what was then Mandatory Palestine, the Dead Sea Scrolls were first moved to the Palestine Archaeological Museum. Following the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the museum&#x27;s management become the responsibility of Jordan.

Following the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, Jordan was defeated and Israel began to occupy the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Palestine Archeological Museum (renamed the Rockefeller Archeological Museum) fell under Israeli administration, and the Dead Sea Scrolls collection held there was moved to the Shrine of the Book. Israel claims ownership of the Dead Sea Scrolls collection currently housed at the Israel Museum. This claimed ownership is contested by both Jordan and the Palestinian Authority.

===Forgeries and claimed private ownership===
Arrangements with the Bedouins left the scrolls in the hands of a third party until a profitable sale of them could be negotiated. That third party, George Isha&#x27;ya, was a member of the Syriac Orthodox Church, who soon contacted St Mark&#x27;s Monastery in the hope of getting an appraisal of the nature of the texts. News of the find then reached Metropolitan Athanasius Yeshue Samuel, better known as Mar Samuel. After examining the scrolls and suspecting their antiquity, Mar Samuel expressed an interest in purchasing them. Four scrolls found their way into his hands: the Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaa), the Community Rule, the Habakkuk Pesher (a commentary on the book of Habakkuk), and the Genesis Apocryphon. More scrolls soon surfaced in the antiquities market, and Professor Eleazer Sukenik and Professor Benjamin Mazar, archaeologists at Hebrew University, soon found themselves in possession of three, The War Scroll, Thanksgiving Hymns, and another, more fragmented, Isaiah Scroll (1QIsab).

Four of the Dead Sea Scrolls eventually went up for sale in an advertisement on 1 June 1954, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. On 1 July 1954, the scrolls, after delicate negotiations and accompanied by three people including Mar Samuel, arrived at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. They were purchased by Professor Mazar and the son of Professor Sukenik, Yigael Yadin, for $250,000 (approximately $ in dollars), and brought to Jerusalem.

Since 2002, many forgeries of Dead Sea Scrolls have appeared on black markets. In 2020, the Museum of the Bible in the United States (also known as Green Collection) reported that all 16 purported &quot;Dead Sea Scroll fragments&quot; they had acquired between 2009 and 2014 were in fact modern forgeries.

===Copyright disputes===
There are three types of documents relating to the Dead Sea Scrolls in which copyright status can be considered ambiguous; the documents themselves, images taken of the documents, and reproductions of the documents. This ambiguity arises from differences in copyright law across different countries and the variable interpretation of such law.

In 1992 a copyright case &quot;Qimron v. Shanks&quot; was brought before the Israeli District court by scholar Elisha Qimron against Hershel Shanks of the Biblical Archaeology Society for violations of United States copyright law regarding his publishing of reconstructions of Dead Sea Scroll texts done by Qimron in &quot;A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls&quot; which were included without his permission. Qimron&#x27;s suit against the Biblical Archaeology Society was done on the grounds that the research they had published was his intellectual property as he had reconstructed about 40% of the published text. In 1993, the district court Judge Dalia Dorner ruled for the plaintiff, Elisha Qimron, in context of both United States and Israeli copyright law and granted the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against Hershel Shanks and others. In an appeal in 2000 in front of Judge Aharon Barak, the verdict was upheld in Israeli Supreme Court in Qimron&#x27;s favour. The court case established the two main principles from which facsimiles are examined under copyright law of the United States and Israel: authorship and originality.

The court&#x27;s ruling not only affirms that the &quot;deciphered text&quot; of the scrolls can fall under copyright of individuals or groups, but makes it clear that the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves do not fall under this copyright law and scholars have a degree of, in the words of U.S. copyright law professor David Nimmer, &quot;freedom&quot; in access. Nimmer has shown how this freedom was in the theory of law applicable, but how it did not exist in reality as the IAA tightly controlled access to the scrolls and photographs of the scrolls.

<text>Asopus (; &quot;Āsōpos&quot;) is the name of four different rivers in Greece and one in Turkey. In Greek mythology, it was also the name of the gods of those rivers. Zeus carried off Aegina, Asopus&#x27; daughter, and Sisyphus, who had witnessed the act, told Asopus that he could reveal the identity of the person who had abducted Aegina, but in return Asopus would have to provide a perennial fountain of water at Corinth, Sisyphus&#x27; city. Accordingly, Asopus produced a fountain at Corinth, and pursued Zeus, but had to retreat for fear of Zeus&#x27; terrible thunderbolt.

==Rivers==
===The rivers in Greece===
#Asopos (Boeotia), a river of Boeotia originating on Mt. Cithaeron and flowing through the district of Plataea into the Euripus Strait.
#Asopos (Corinthia) or Phliasian Asopus, originating in Phliasian territory and flowing through Sicyonian territory into the Gulf of Corinth near Sicyon. Pausanias mentions that Phliasians and Sicyonians claimed that its source was in fact the Phrygian and Carian river Maeander that purportedly descended underground where it appeared to enter the sea at Miletus and rose again in the Peloponnesos as Asopus.
#Asopos (Thessaly) or Trachean Asopus, a river originating on Mount Oeta in Thessaly and emptying into the Malian Gulf near Thermopylae, mentioned by Herodotus (7.199, 216–17).
#Asopus, a river in Corfu

===The river in Turkey===
#Phrygian Asopus, a small river in Phrygia which joins the River Lycus near Laodicea on the Lycus.

==Mythology==
As mythological entities, the Boeotian river Asopus and the Phliasian river Asopus are much confounded. They are duplicated a second time as supposed mortal kings who gave their names to the corresponding rivers. Indeed, logically, since the children fathered by gods on various daughters of either Boeotian or Phliasian Asopus were mortal in these tales, then the daughters themselves must have been mortal, and therefore either the mother of these daughters (often given as Metope daughter of river Ladon) or their father Asopus must have been mortal, or both of them.

The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; informs that the river Asopus was a son of Oceanus and Tethys or, according to Acusilaus, of Poseidon by Pero (otherwise unknown to us), or according to yet others of Zeus by Eurynome; it is uncertain whether he knows there is more than one river named Asopus.

===Boeotian Asopus===
===Phliasian Asopus===
Pausanias writes that during the reign of Aras, the first earth-born king of Sicyonian land, Asopus, said to be son of Poseidon by Celusa (this Celusa otherwise unknown but possibly identical to Pero mentioned above), discovered for him the river called Asopus and gave it his name. Diodorus Siculus similarly presents Asopus (here son of Oceanus and Tethys) as a settler in Phlius and husband of Metope daughter of Ladon, presumably here and elsewhere the Arcadian river Ladon.

Pausanias mentions his daughter Nemea, eponym for the region of the same name (possibly the mother of Archemorus in Aeschylus&#x27; lost play &quot;Nemea&quot;). Pausanias and Diodorus Siculus also mention a daughter Harpina and state that according to the traditions of the Eleans and Phliasians, Ares lay with her in the city of Pisa and they had a son, Oenomaus, who Pausanias says founded the city of Harpina named after her, not far from the river Harpinates.

The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; refers to Ismene daughter of Asopus who was wife of Argus Panoptes to whom she bore Iasus, the father of Io.

===Mixed tales===
====Daughters of Asopus (Asopides)====

We find first in Pindar&#x27;s odes the sisters, Aegina and Thebe, here the youngest daughters of Boeotian Asopus by Metope who came from Stymphalia in Arcadia. Both are abducted by the god Zeus, one carried to the island of Oenone later to be named &quot;Aegina&quot; and the other to Dirce&#x27;s water to be queen there.

Corinna, Pindar&#x27;s contemporary, in a damaged fragment, mentions nine daughters of Boeotian Asopus: Aegina, Thebe, and Plataea abducted by Zeus; Corcyra, Salamis, and Euboea abducted by Poseidon; Sinope and Thespia (who has been dealt with above) abducted by Apollo; and Tanagra abducted by Hermes. Asopus cannot discover what has become of them until the seer Acraephen (otherwise unknown) tells him that the gods Eros and Aphrodite persuaded the four gods to come secretly to his house and steal his nine daughters. He advises Asopus to yield to the immortals and cease grieving since he is father-in-law to gods. This hints that perhaps, for Corinna, Asopus himself is not a god. Asopus accepts Acraephen&#x27;s advice.

Of these daughters, Thebe, Plataea, Thespia and Tanagra are properly Boeotian. Euboea is near Boeotia, but Salamis and Aegina are regions that would perhaps associate better with the Phliasian Asopus. Korkyra (Corfu) is definitely Corinthian rather than Boeotian. Sinope is surely the colony of Sinope on the Black Sea (founded from Miletus).

It is notable that tradition as it comes down to us does not record any children resulting from a union of gods with Thebe, Plataea, Thespia or Tanagra and only Diodorus mentions the otherwise unknown sons Phaiax, son of Poseidon by Corcyra, and Syrus sprung from Apollo by Sinope and that this child of Sinope is opposed by a conflicting tradition that Sinope tricked Zeus, Apollo and Halys and remained a virgin.

Later texts mostly indicate Zeus&#x27; abduction of Aegina, presented as a solitary abduction. Asopus is often clearly the Phliasian Asopus (so indicated by Pherecydes) but not always so. Asopus chases after Zeus and his daughter until Zeus turns upon him and strikes him with a thunderbolt, whence ever after Asopus is lame and flows very slowly, a feature ascribed to both the Boeotian and Phliasian Asopus. In these tales Asopus discovers the truth about the abduction from Sisyphus, King of Corinth in return for creating a spring on the Corinthian Acropolis. This spring, according to Pausanias was behind the temple of Aphrodite and people said its water was the same as that of the spring Peirene, the water in the city flowing from it underground.

Diodorus Siculus who, as mentioned, places his Asopus in Phlius, gives him twelve daughters. Diodorus&#x27; list omits the Plataea and Boeotia included by Corinna&#x27;s list of nine daughters. But it introduces Chalcis which was the chief city of Boeotia and may represent Boeotia. To make up the twelve Diodorus&#x27; list also adds Peirene (the famous spring in Corinth), Cleone (possible eponym of the small city of Cleonae on the road from Corinth to Argos according to Pausanias), Ornia (possible eponym of the small town of Orneai south of Phlius), and Asopis. But &quot;Asopis&quot; may mean &quot;Asopian&quot; and be an epithet for one of the other known daughters. Ovid in his poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; twice calls Aegina by the name &quot;Asopis&quot;. Indeed, in his very next section Diodorus discusses Asopus&#x27; daughter Harpina who has been discussed above.

Apollodorus claims Asopus had twenty daughters but he does not provide a list.

Pausanias mentions three supposed daughters of Phliasian Asopus named Corcyra, Aegina, and Thebe according to the Phliasians and notes additionally that the Thebans insist that this Thebe was daughter of the Boeotian Asopus. He mentions no dispute about the others which suggests that in his time the assignment of Aegina to the Phliasian Asopus was generally admitted.

Pausanias also describes a group sculpture in the sanctuary of Hippodamia at Olympia donated by the Phliasians. It included Nemea, Zeus seizing Aegina, Harpina, Corcyra, Thebe, and Asopus himself. It seems the Phliasians were insistent that Thebe belonged to their Asopus.

According to Pherecydes, Asopus also fathered Philyra who became the mother of Hypseus by Peneus. In some sources, Pronoe who was the mother of Phocus by Poseidon was a daughter of Asopus.

====Sons of Asopus====

Both Apollodrus and Diodorus also mention two sons of Asopus, the first named Ismenus and the second named Pelagon (by Apollodorus) or Pelasgus (by Diodorus). Nothing else has survived about this Pelagon. Of Ismenus, Diodorus states only that he emigrated to Boeotia and settled near the Boeotian river, which was afterwards named Ismenus from his name. Another son, Hypseus who fought in the war of the Seven against Thebes was killed by Capaneus.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Myrmidons (or Myrmidones; , &quot;Murmidónes&quot;, singular: , &quot;Murmidṓn&quot;) were an ancient Thessalian tribe.

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Myrmidons are the soldiers commanded by Achilles. Their eponymous ancestor was Myrmidon, a king of Phthiotis, who was a son of Zeus and &quot;wide-ruling&quot; Eurymedousa, a princess of Phthiotis. In one account, Zeus seduced Eurymedousa in the form of an ant.

An etiological myth of their origins, simply expanding upon their supposed etymology—the name in Classical Greek was interpreted as &quot;ant-people&quot;, from &quot;myrmedon&quot; (, &quot;murmēdṓn&quot;, plural: , &quot;murmēdónes&quot;), which means &quot;ant-nest&quot;—was first mentioned by Ovid in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. In Ovid&#x27;s telling, the Myrmidons were simple worker-ants on the island of Aegina.

== Ovid&#x27;s myth of the repopulation of Aegina ==
Hera, queen of the gods, sent a plague to kill all the human inhabitants of Aegina because the island was named for one of the lovers of Zeus. King Aeacus, a son of Zeus and the intended target of Hera along with his mother, prayed to his father for a means to repopulate the island.

As the &quot;myrmekes&quot; (Ancient Greek: μύρμηκες, &quot;múrmēkes&quot;, singular: μύρμηξ, &quot;múrmēx&quot;), the ants of the island, were unaffected by the sickness, Zeus responded by transforming them into a race of men, the Myrmidons. They were as fierce and hardy as ants, and intensely loyal to their leader.

After a time, Aeacus exiled his two sons, Peleus and Telamon, for murdering their half-brother, Phocus. Peleus went to Phthia and a group of Myrmidons followed him to Thessaly. Peleus&#x27;s son, Achilles, brought them to Troy to fight in the Trojan War. They feature as the loyal followers of Achilles in most accounts of the Trojan War.

Another tradition states that the Myrmidons had no such remarkable beginnings, but were merely the descendants of Myrmidon, a Thessalian nobleman, who married Peisidice, the daughter of Aeolus, king of Thessaly. Myrmidon was the father of Actor and Antiphus. As king of Phthia, Actor (or his son) invited Peleus to stay in Thessaly.

== Medieval Myrmidons ==
Achilles was described by Leo the Deacon (born ca. 950) not as Hellene, but as Scythian, while according to the Byzantine author John Malalas (c. 491–578), his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and &quot;known now as Bulgars&quot;. The 12th-century Byzantine poet John Tzetzes also identified the Myrmidons with the Bulgars, whom he also identified with the Paeonians, although the latter may be intended in a purely geographical sense. In the 11th century, Michael Attaleiates called the Rus&#x27; Myrmidons, but this usage did not catch on.

According to Byzantine history scholar Andrew J. Ekonomou, these represent intentional distortions designed to &quot;minimize the valor of pagan heroes, and eventually to extinguish their memory altogether&quot;. Anthony Kaldellis, on the other hand, argues that such use of classical ethnonyms for modern peoples &quot;do not really fall under the category of distortion at all&quot;.

== Modern Myrmidons ==
The Myrmidons of Greek myth were known for their loyalty to their leaders, so that in pre-industrial Europe the word &quot;myrmidon&quot; carried many of the same connotations that &quot;robot&quot; does today. &quot;Myrmidon&quot; later came to mean &quot;hired ruffian&quot;, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

* Henry Fielding in &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1749, Book XV, ch. 5) employs the term in the sense of &quot;hired thugs&quot;: &quot;The door flew open, and in came Squire Western, with his parson and a set of myrmidons at his heels.&quot;
* The Royal Navy has had several ships called HMS &quot;Myrmidon&quot;.
* The United States Navy has had one vessel named USS &quot;Myrmidon&quot; (ARL-16)
* &quot;The Myrmidons&quot; was the name adopted in 1865 by a private dining society in Merton College, Oxford, which continues in existence. Max Beerbohm was a member (and Hon. Secretary), and the club called &quot;The Junta&quot; that features in his Oxford novel &quot;Zuleika Dobson&quot; is probably modelled on the Myrmidons. Other former members include Lord Randolph Churchill and Andrew Irvine.

<text>In Greek mythology, Queen Endeïs (; Ancient Greek: Ενδηίς or Ενδαΐς) was the wife of King Aeacus and mother of the heroes Telamon and Peleus (since Peleus was the father of Achilles, Endeïs was Achilles&#x27;s grandmother). The name is a dialect variant of Engaios (&quot;Ἐγγαῖος&quot;, &quot;in the earth&quot;).

== Family ==
Endeïs was either the daughter of Chiron and the nymph Chariclo; the daughter of Pandion of Athens; or the daughter of the Megarian warlord Sciron.

In some versions, Endeïs&#x27;s father, Sciron, married her to Aeacus after he declared Sciron the military leader of Megara.

== Mythology ==
Endeïs hated her stepson Phocus, Aeacus&#x27;s son by the Nereid Psamathe, and wished he were dead. It is also thought that Telamon and Peleus were jealous of Phocus because he excelled at athletic sports. In either case they drew lots and Telamon was chosen to murder Phocus, his half brother. This was done in a ruse at the pentathlon which they convinced Phocus to participate in. In the sport, Telamon threw a discus under the pretense of participating in the competition. The projectile hit its target, &quot;accidentally&quot; killing Phocus.

Both Telamon and Peleus hid the body of Phocus, but it was soon discovered. For this Aeacus exiled them both from Aegina.

<text>In Greek mythology, Telamon (; Ancient Greek: , &quot;Telamōn&quot; means &quot;broad strap&quot;) was the son of King Aeacus of Aegina, and Endeïs, a mountain nymph. The elder brother of Peleus, Telamon sailed alongside Jason as one of his Argonauts, and was present at the hunt for the Calydonian Boar. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, he was the father of Greek heroes Ajax the Great and Teucer by different mothers. Some accounts mention a third son of his, Trambelus. He and Peleus were also close friends of Heracles, assisting him on his expeditions against the Amazons and his assault on Troy (see below).

In an earlier account recorded by Pherecydes of Athens, Telamon and Peleus were not brothers, but friends. According to this account, Telamon was the son of Actaeus and Glauce, with the latter being the daughter of Cychreus, king of Salamis; and Telamon married Periboea (Eriboea), daughter of King Alcathous of Megara.

==Mythology==
After killing their half-brother, Phocus, Telamon and Peleus fled Aegina and made their way to the island of Salamis, where King Cychreus welcomed Telamon and befriended him. Telamon married Cychreus&#x27; daughter Periboea, who gave birth to Ajax; sometime later, Cychreus gave Telamon his kingdom. In other versions of the myth Cychreus&#x27; daughter is named Glauce, and Periboea is Telamon&#x27;s second wife, and the daughter of Alcathous.

===Trojan War===
Telamon also features in both versions of Heracles&#x27; sacking of Troy, which was ruled by King Laomedon (or Tros in the alternate versions). Before the Trojan War, Poseidon sent a sea monster to attack Troy.

; Tros version
In the King Tros version, Heracles (along with Telamon and Oicles) agreed to kill the monster if Tros would give him the horses he received from Zeus as compensation for Zeus&#x27; kidnapping Tros&#x27; son, Ganymede. Tros agreed; Heracles succeeded and Telamon married Hesione, Tros&#x27; daughter, by whom he sired Teucer.

; Laomedon version
In the King Laomedon version, Laomedon planned on sacrificing his daughter Hesione to Poseidon in the hope of appeasing him. Heracles rescued her at the last minute and killed both the monster and Laomedon and Laomedon&#x27;s sons, except for Ganymede, who was on Mount Olympus, and Podarces, who saved his own life by giving Heracles a golden veil Hesione had made. Telamon took Hesione as a war prize and married her, and she gave birth by him to Teucer. When Ajax later committed suicide at Troy, Telamon banished Teucer from Salamis for failing to bring his brother home.

; Bibliotheca version
In Apollodorus&#x27; &quot;Library&quot;, Telamon was almost killed during the siege of Troy. Telamon was the first one to break through the Trojan wall, which enraged Hercules as he was coveting that glory for himself. Hercules was about to cut him down with his sword when Telamon began to quickly assemble an altar out of nearby stones in honor of Hercules. Hercules was so pleased, after the sack of Troy he gave Telamon Hesione as a wife. Hesione requested that she be able to bring her brother Podarces with her. Hercules would not allow it unless Hesione bought Podarces as a slave. Hesione paid for her brother with a veil. Podarces&#x27; name was then changed to Priam – which, according to Greek author Apollodorus, was derived from the Greek phrase &quot;to buy&quot;.

==In architecture==
In architecture, telamons are colossal male figures used as columns. These are also called atlas, atlantes, or atlantids; they are the male versions of caryatids.

==The Telamon==

The &quot;Telamon&quot; (also &quot;Song of Telamon&quot;, &quot;Telamon Song&quot;, &quot;Telamon-song&quot;) is an ancient Greek song (fl. 5th century BC) only found referred to by name in some ancient Greek plays and later scholia or commentaries. It is usually thought to be a warlike song about Telamon&#x27;s son Ajax, though some other commentaries thought it to be a mournful song about Telamon himself. It began with: &quot;Son of Telamon, warlike Ajax! They say you are the bravest of the Greeks who came to Troy, next to Achilles.&quot;

<text>In Greek mythology and later art, the name Hesione (; Ancient Greek: Ἡσιόνη) refers to various mythological figures, of whom the Trojan princess Hesione is most known.

==Mythology==
According to the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, the most prominent Hesione was a Trojan princess, daughter of King Laomedon of Troy, sister of Priam and second wife of King Telamon of Salamis. The first notable myth Hesione is cited in is that of Hercules, who saves her from a sea monster. However, her role becomes significant many years later when she is described as a potential trigger of the Trojan War.

Apollo and Poseidon were angry at King Laomedon because he refused to pay the wage he promised them for building Troy&#x27;s walls. Apollo sent a plague and Poseidon a sea monster to destroy Troy. Oracles promised deliverance if Laomedon would expose his daughter Hesione to be devoured by the sea monster Cetus (in other versions, the lot happened to fall on her) and he exposed her by fastening her naked to the rocks near the sea. Heracles, Telamon, and Oicles happened to arrive on their return from the expedition against the Amazons. Seeing her exposed, Heracles promised to save her on condition that Laomedon would give him the wonderful horses he had received from Zeus as compensation for Zeus&#x27; kidnapping of Ganymede. Laomedon agreed, and Heracles slew the monster. In some accounts, after being swallowed by it, he hacked at its innards for three days before it died. He emerged, having lost all his hair. However, Laomedon refused to give him the promised award.

In a later expedition, Heracles attacked Troy, slew Laomedon and all of Laomedon&#x27;s sons except the youngest, Podarces. Heracles gave Laomedon&#x27;s daughter Hesione as a prize to Telamon instead of keeping her for himself. He allowed her to take with her any captives that she wished; she chose her brother Podarces. Heracles allowed her to ransom him in exchange for her veil. Therefore, Podarces henceforth became known as Priam, from ancient Greek πρίασθαι priasthai, meaning &quot;to buy&quot;. Heracles then bestowed the government of Troy on Priam. However, it is also claimed that Priam simply happened to be absent campaigning in Phrygia during Heracles&#x27; attack on Troy.

Hesione was taken home by Telamon, married him, and bore him a son, Teucros, half-brother to Telamon&#x27;s son from his first marriage, Ajax. Alternatively, she became pregnant with Trambelus while still on board the ship and then escaped; it is also possible, though, that the mother of Trambelus was not Hesione, but a certain Theaneira.

Many years later, when Hesione was an old woman, Priam sent Antenor and Anchises to Greece to demand Hesione&#x27;s return, but they were rejected and driven away. Priam then sent Paris and Aeneas to retrieve her, but Paris got sidetracked and instead brought back Helen, queen of Sparta and wife of Menelaus. Priam was ultimately willing to accept the abduction of Helen, due to the Greeks&#x27; refusal to return Hesione.

===Spurious references===
The name Hesione in Dictys Cretensis 4.22 appears to be an error for Plesione of Dictys 1.9 and that in turn an error for Pleione.

<text>In Greek mythology, Teucer (; , also Teucrus, Teucros or Teucris), was the son of King Telamon of Salamis Island and his second wife Hesione, daughter of King Laomedon of Troy. He fought alongside his half-brother, Ajax, in the Trojan War and is the legendary founder of the city of Salamis on Cyprus. Through his mother, Teucer was the nephew of King Priam of Troy and the cousin of Hector and Paris—all of whom he fought against in the Trojan War.

==Myths==
During the Trojan War, Teucer was mainly a great archer, who loosed his shafts from behind the giant shield of his half-brother Ajax the Great. When Hector was driving the Achaeans back toward their ships, Teucer gave the Argives some success by killing many of the charging Trojans, including Hector&#x27;s charioteer, Archeptolemus son of Iphitos. However, every time he shot an arrow at Hector, Apollo, the protector of the Trojans, would foil the shot. At one point in his rage at Teucer&#x27;s success, Hector picked up a huge rock and flung it at him. The rock injured Teucer, so that he retired from the fighting for a time. He took up a spear to fight in the war after his bow was broken by Zeus. He once again challenged Hector, and narrowly avoided the path of Hector&#x27;s flying javelin in the ensuing battle. He was also one of the Danaans to enter the Trojan Horse. In total, Teucer slew thirty Trojans during the war; of those Homer mentions Aretaon, Orsilochus, Ormenus, Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, Lycophontes, Amopaon, Melanippus, Prothoon and Periphetes, as well as the aforementioned Archeptolemus. He also wounded Glaucus, son of Hippolochus.

After Ajax&#x27;s suicide, Teucer guarded the body to make sure it was buried, insulting Menelaus and Agamemnon when they tried to stop the burial. Finally, Odysseus persuaded Agamemnon to let the burial happen. Because of his half-brother&#x27;s suicide, Teucer stood trial before his father, where he was found guilty of negligence for not bringing his dead half-brother&#x27;s body or his arms back with him. He was disowned by his father, wasn&#x27;t allowed back on Salamis Island, and set out to find a new home. His departing words were introduced in the seventh ode of the first book of the Roman poet Horace&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot;, in which he exhorts his companions &quot;nil desperandum&quot;, &quot;do not despair&quot;, and announces &quot;cras ingens iterabimus aequor&quot;, &quot;tomorrow we shall set out upon the vast ocean&quot;. This speech has been given a wider applicability in relation to the theme of voyages of discovery, also found in the &quot;Ulysses&quot; of Tennyson.

Teucer eventually joined King Belus of Tyre in his campaign against Cyprus, and when the island was seized, Belus handed it over to him in reward for his assistance. Teucer founded the city of Salamis on Cyprus, which he named after his home state. He further married Eune, daughter of Cinyras, king of Cyprus, and had by her a daughter Asteria. Anaxarete of Cyprus was called &quot;a proud princess in the line of Teucer&#x27;s descendants&quot;.

The name Teucer is believed to be related to the name of the West Hittite God Tarku (East Hittite Teshub)—the Indo-European Storm God—a role which explains his relationship to Belus, who is associated with the Carthaginian god Baal Hammon.

Local legends of the city of Pontevedra (Galicia) relate the foundation of this city to Teucer (&quot;Teucro&quot;), although this seems to be based more on the suspicions that Greek traders might have reached that area in ancient times, hence introducing a number of Greek stories. The city is sometimes poetically called &quot;The City of Teucer&quot; and its inhabitants &quot;teucrinos&quot;. A number of sporting clubs in the municipality use names related to Teucer. Some versions of the legend say that Teucer reached Galicia by following a sea nymph or mermaid called Leucoina, while others point to her as the cause of his death, when the hero drowned trying to reach her.

<text>Glenn Branca (October 6, 1948 – May 13, 2018) was an American avant-garde composer, guitarist, and luthier. Known for his use of volume, alternative guitar tunings, repetition, droning, and the harmonic series, he was a driving force behind the genres of no wave, totalism and noise rock. Branca received a 2009 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award.

==Life and work==

===Beginnings: 1960s and early 1970s===
Born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Branca started playing the guitar at age 15. He also created a number of tape sound art collage pieces for his own amusement. After attending York College in 1966–1967, he started the short-lived cover band The Crystal Ship with Al Whiteside and Dave Speece in the summer of 1967. In the early 1970s, Branca studied theater at Emerson College in Boston. In 1973, he moved from Boston to London with his then girlfriend Meg English.

After moving back to Boston in 1974, he met John Rehberger. While there, he began experimenting with sound as the founder of an experimental theater group called Bastard Theatre in 1975. Working out of a loft on Massachusetts Avenue they wrote and produced the music/theater piece &quot;Anthropophagoi&quot; for a two-week run. In 1976, The Bastard Theatre&#x27;s second production was &quot;What Actually Happened&quot; at a new loft in Central Square, Cambridge and later at The Boston Arts Group. Considering the unconventional and sometimes confrontational nature of the productions, the shows still received interested reviews from the &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. All music for Bastard Theatre productions were original compositions by Branca or Rehberger and were performed live by the actor/musicians.

===New York: Late 1970s and 1980s===
In 1976, Branca moved to New York City to continue in experimental theater. He encountered the N. Dodo Band and watched their rehearsals in Chelsea, hoping to use the space for a theater production. Branca spent time with one of its members, Jeffrey Lohn, who introduced him to bands such as Suicide. The two began forming a theater group when Branca decided he wanted to form a band, which he called the Static and later Theoretical Girls. Branca put up posters to recruit members, and after seeing one of the posters, Lohn expressed interest.

Lohn&#x27;s girlfriend Margaret De Wys joined the band as its bassist, and they borrowed drummer Mike Anthol from the N. Dodo Band. Artist Dan Graham booked the band at Franklin Furnace for its first performance. The group reformed in 1977 with Wharton Tiers as its drummer. Branca also recorded Barbara Ess&#x27;s band Y Pants for their debut release on 99 Records and performed with Rhys Chatham&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Trio&quot; on occasion from 1977 to 1979, a noise music experience that was very important in the development of his compositional voice (Branca 1979). In 1982, Branca launched his own record label, Neutral Records, releasing Y Pants&#x27; LP and the first few records by New York noise rockers Sonic Youth.

In 1978, Branca participated in the inception of the No Wave movement by participating twice in a five night no wave music festival at Artists Space organized by artists Michael Zwack and Robert Longo. It featured ten post-punk New York City bands; including Rhys Chatham&#x27;s The Gynecologists, Communists, Branca&#x27;s Theoretical Girls, Terminal, Chatham&#x27;s Tone Death (performing his composition for electric guitars &quot;Guitar Trio&quot;) and Branca&#x27;s Daily Life (with Barbara Ess, Paul McMahon and Christine Hahn).

In the early 1980s, Branca released his first album under his own name, &quot;Lesson No. 1&quot;. In the same year, he composed several medium-length compositions for electric guitar ensembles, including &quot;The Ascension&quot; (1981) and &quot;Indeterminate Activity of Resultant Masses&quot; (1981). &quot;The Ascension&quot; appeared on his second same titled solo album in 1981, &quot;Indeterminate Activity of Resultant Masses&quot; wasn&#x27;t released until 2008. 

Soon after these two compositions, he began composing symphonies for orchestras of electric guitars and percussion, which blended droning industrial cacophony and microtonality with quasi-mysticism and advanced mathematics. In 1982 he worked with Z&#x27;EV for Branca&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 in which Z&#x27;EV had a solo segment swinging with metal can overhead, and rattling chains and sheets of steel. With Symphony No. 3 (&quot;Gloria&quot;) (1983), he began to systematically compose for the harmonic series, which he considered to be the structure underlying not only all music but most human endeavors. In this project, Branca was initially influenced by the writings of Dane Rudhyar, Hermann von Helmholtz, and Harry Partch.

Early members of his group included Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth, Page Hamilton of Helmet, Phil Kline of The Del-Byzanteens, and several members of Swans including Michael Gira, Dan Braun, and Algis Kizys.

===Custom-built musical instruments===
To further develop his compositions based on the harmonic series Branca built several electrically amplified instruments of his own invention, expanding his ensemble beyond the guitar. A few of these instruments were third bridge zithers he called &quot;harmonics guitars&quot;. He also built instruments with many strings which he referred to as &quot;mallet guitars&quot; because they were percussion instruments played with drumsticks and monotone electric cymbaloms with an additional third bridge on resonating positions. Many of these instruments can be seen in the live performances that appeared on the DVD &quot;Glenn Branca - Symphonies 8 &amp; 10 - Live at The Kitchen&quot;.
===Late work: 1990s to 2018===

In the early 1990s, David Baratier attempted to document Branca&#x27;s teaching style in &quot;They Walked in Line&quot;. In September 1996, The Glenn Branca Ensemble played at the opening ceremony for the Aarhus Festival in Denmark. The ceremony took place in the Musikhuset Opera House, and in the audience were the Queen of Denmark, the mayor of Aarhus and other dignitaries. After the composer received more than 25 major commissions starting in 1981 until the time of his death in 2018, Branca&#x27;s music has started to receive academic attention. Some scholars, most prominently Kyle Gann, consider him (and Rhys Chatham) to be a member of the totalist school of post-minimalism.

Beginning with Symphony No. 7, Branca began composing for traditional orchestra, although he never abandoned the electric guitar. Branca also played duets for excessively amplified guitars with his wife, Reg Bloor, and conducted his 13th symphony for 100 electric guitars at the base of the World Trade Center in New York City on June 13, 2001, less than three months before the center&#x27;s destruction in the September 11 attacks. Since that time his 100 guitar piece has been performed in cities all over the U.S. and Europe. In 2008, he wrote his 14th Symphony, entitled &quot;The Harmonic Series&quot;, which is performed by a traditional orchestra. The first (and only completed) movement of this symphony, named &quot;2,000,000,000 Light Years From Home&quot; premiered in St. Louis performed by the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra conducted by David Robertson on November 13, 2008. This was the 12th major orchestra to perform Branca&#x27;s orchestral work since 1986.

In 2008, he was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award as well as a CAPS grant in 1983, an award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1988 and a NYSCA grant in 1998, all for music composition. In 2010, BBN Music re-released Branca&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;The Ascension&quot; as a special edition on 180 gram vinyl and Branca wrote a piece &quot;The Ascension: The Sequel&quot;, which was released in the same year on the label Systems Neutralizers. This follow up piece led to new interest in his work and notable performances at Primavera Sound Festival 2011 and Villette Sonique 2011.

In October 2014, Branca premiered &quot;Ascension Three&quot;, touring it with Glenn Branca Ensemble in Europe. In February 2015, Branca&#x27;s second 100 electric guitars piece, &quot;Symphony No. 16 (Orgasm)&quot;, was premiered at Cité de la Musique in Paris. &quot;The Light (for David)&quot; for four guitars, bass and drums, premiered in October 2016 at the Roulette in Brooklyn.

===Death===
On May 14, 2018, Reg Bloor&#x27;s official Facebook page revealed in a post that Branca had died from throat cancer the night before. He was 69.

==Legacy==
Branca was featured in 2023 at the Centre Pompidou in a Nicolas Ballet curated exhibition entitled &quot;Who You Staring At: Culture visuelle de la scène no wave des années 1970 et 1980&quot; (&quot;Visual culture of the no wave scene in the 1970s and 1980s&quot;).

<doc id="77736" wikidata="Q505677" url="?curid=77736" title="Thurston Moore">
<text>Thurston Joseph Moore (born July 25, 1958) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter best known as a member of the rock band Sonic Youth. He has also participated in many solo and group collaborations outside Sonic Youth, as well as running the Ecstatic Peace! record label. Moore was ranked 34th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2004 edition of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

In 2012, Moore started a new band Chelsea Light Moving, whose eponymous debut was released on March 5, 2013. In 2015, Chelsea Light Moving disbanded after one studio album release. Moore and the other members of the band continue to make music under his solo project and other bands.

==Early years==
Moore was born July 25, 1958, at Doctors Hospital in Coral Gables, Florida, to George E. Moore, a professor of music, and Eleanor Nann Moore. In 1967, he and his family (including brother Frederick Eugene Moore, born 1953, and sister Susan Dorothy Moore, born 1956) moved to Bethel, Connecticut. Raised Catholic, he attended St. Joseph&#x27;s School in Danbury, CT followed by St. Mary&#x27;s School in Bethel and attended Bethel High School from 1973 to 1976. In the summer of 1963, he experienced his first exposure to rock music through his brother bringing home the record &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and bought him his first electric guitar. 

He enrolled at Western Connecticut State University in fall 1976, but left after one quarter and moved to East 13th Street between Avenues A and B in New York City to join the burgeoning post-punk and no wave music scenes. It was there that he was able to watch shows by the likes of Patti Smith and spoken-word performances by William S. Burroughs. At that time, the arrival of new groups changed his view on music and all of his records &quot;got kind of put into the basement. And they were supplanted by [...] the Sex Pistols and Blondie and Talking Heads and Siouxsie and the Banshees. It was a completely new world, a new identity of music that was an option for youth culture.&quot; In 1980, he moved in with Kim Gordon to an apartment at 84 Eldridge St. below artist Dan Graham, eventually befriending him, sometimes using records from Graham&#x27;s collection for mix tapes.

Once in the city, Moore was briefly a member of the hardcore punk band Even Worse, featuring future &quot;The Big Takeover&quot; editor (and future Springhouse drummer) Jack Rabid. After exiting the band, Moore and Lee Ranaldo learned experimental guitar techniques in Glenn Branca&#x27;s &quot;guitar orchestras&quot;. Moore has spoken about influences on his music tastes at this time, including British bands Wire, the Pop Group, the Raincoats, the Slits, and Public Image Ltd (&quot;I used to have these fantasies in the 70s about leaving New York and coming to London to hang out with Public Image&quot;).

==Sonic Youth==

Moore met Kim Gordon in 1980 at the final gig of the Coachmen, the band he was in with J.D. King, Daniel Walworth (replaced by Dave Keay), and Bob Pullin. Moore, with Gordon, Anne Demarinis and Dave Keay formed a band, appearing under names like Male Bonding, Red Milk, and the Arcadians, before settling on Moore&#x27;s choice of Sonic Youth just before June 1981. The band played Noise Fest in June 1981 at New York&#x27;s White Columns gallery, where Lee Ranaldo was playing as a member of Glenn Branca&#x27;s electric guitar ensemble as well as in duo with David Linton as Avoidance Behavior. Moore invited Ranaldo, who he had known when the Coachmen shared a CBGB stage with Ranaldo&#x27;s 1970s band the Flux, to join the band. The new trio played three songs at the festival later in the week without a drummer. Each band member took turns playing the drums, until they met drummer Richard Edson. The band signed to Neutral Records, then to Homestead Records, and then to SST Records.

Moore and Ranaldo make extensive use of unusual guitar tunings, often heavily modifying their instruments to provide unusual timbres and drones. They are known for bringing upwards of fifty guitars to every gig, using some guitars for one song only. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Moore and Ranaldo the 33rd and 34th &quot;Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

Thurston Moore has explained the band&#x27;s decision to sign with DGC Records at a time when many were fiercely dedicated to independent record labels like SST, Dischord and Sub Pop:
&quot;We noticed Hüsker Dü&#x27;s music hadn&#x27;t changed when they signed to Warner. On the independent labels we dealt with, SST Records, Blast First Records and Neutral Records, if there was accounting, it was always somewhat suspect. With Geffen, we would get an advance that would allow us to be able to pay our rents, get health insurance, have a slightly better lifestyle, and maybe, just maybe, not have to work day jobs. We felt like we could negotiate a contract that would make sense.&quot;

When Steve Albini accused corporate labels of ripping off artists, Moore wrote in response that a band &quot;getting butt fucked by corporate labels [must] be really &quot;stupid&quot;&quot;. He defended the band&#x27;s decision to sign with DGC Records explaining that they knew what they were getting into and viewed it more as &quot;buying in&quot; than &quot;selling out&quot;.

In 2011, Moore and his wife, Sonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon, separated; shortly afterward, Sonic Youth went on indefinite hiatus. Though his marriage was ending Moore never claimed that Sonic Youth was finished.

==Work outside Sonic Youth==
In addition to his work with Sonic Youth, Moore has also released albums as a solo artist. He and Gordon released a few songs as Mirror/Dash. Moore established Protest Records as an online gesture of activism but the project has since lapsed. Moore has collaborated with scores of musicians, including Maryanne Amacher, Lydia Lunch, Don Dietrich and Jim Sauter of Borbetomagus, DJ Spooky, William Hooker, Daniel Carter, Christian Marclay, Mike Watt, Five Starcle Men, Loren Mazzacane Connors, Dredd Foole, William Winant, the Thing, Nels Cline, Cock E.S.P., John Moloney, Glenn Branca, Yamantaka Eye, Beck, My Cat is an Alien, John Russell, Steve Noble, John Edwards, Haino Keiji, John Zorn, Yoko Ono, Takehisa Kosugi, and others. Moore was a member of the earliest incarnations of Swans in 1982 and &#x27;83, playing bass guitar.

In the early 1990s, Moore formed the side band Dim Stars, with Richard Hell, Don Fleming, Steve Shelley with a guest appearance by Robert Quine. Moore performed solo on the side stage of the 1993 Lollapalooza tour. Additionally, Moore also contributed guitar work and backing vocals on &quot;Crush with Eyeliner&quot;, which appeared on R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Monster&quot;. He played Fred Cracklin in the &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode dedicated to Sonny Sharrock. In 2000 he contributed improvised guitar pieces for a collaborative project with conceptual artist/guitarist Marco Fusinato. Since 2004, he has recorded and performed with the noise collective To Live and Shave in L.A., the lineup of which also features Andrew W.K. He recorded with the band at Sonic Youth&#x27;s former studio in Manhattan, and later performed with them at the George W. Bush &quot;anti-inaugural&quot; Noise Against Fascism concert in Washington, D.C., which Moore curated, named in reference to Sonic Youth&#x27;s 1992 song &quot;Youth Against Fascism&quot;. Moore curated the &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; weekend of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival in 2006.

In 2007, Moore&#x27;s label Ecstatic Peace released a solo album titled &quot;Trees Outside the Academy&quot;. The album was recorded at J Mascis&#x27; studio in Amherst, Massachusetts. The album features Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley and violinist Samara Lubelski. The album also features collaborations between Mascis and Charalambides&#x27; Christina Carter, who performs a duet with Moore on the track, &quot;Honest James&quot;.

In 2008, Moore and former Be Your Own Pet vocalist Jemina Pearl recorded a cover of the Ramones song &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot; for the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; episode &quot;There Might Be Blood&quot;.

Since 2008, Moore has provided narration for a variety of documentaries on the National Geographic Channel. His work includes &quot;Inside: Straight Edge&quot; and the &quot;Hard Time&quot; series about life in prison.

In 2012, Moore and Kim Gordon released a collaborative album with Yoko Ono titled &quot;Yokokimthurston&quot;. Also that year, Moore joined the black metal super group Twilight. He then started a new band called Chelsea Light Moving. Their first track, &quot;Burroughs&quot;, was released as a free download. Their eponymous debut album came out in 2013. The release coincided with the SXSW Festival where they made numerous appearances including a free show at Mellow Johnny&#x27;s bike shop. He played guitar on &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot; alongside Ron and Russell Mael in a 2013 Sparks concert at the Union Chapel, Islington, London. In 2014, Moore released &quot;The Best Day&quot;, a solo album featuring Steve Shelley and My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s Debbie Googe as rhythm section, and James Sedwards on guitar.

In 2018, Moore presented at London&#x27;s Barbican Centre his work &#x27;Galaxies&#x27;, an experimental 12-string guitar ensemble. Among the twelve person orchestra were Deb Googe, Jonah Falco, Ray Aggs, Joseph Coward and others. In 2019, Moore released &quot;Spirit Counsel&quot;, an avant-garde rock three-disc box set. The first track, &quot;Alice Moki Jayne&quot;, is a 63-minute long song named for the spouses of John Coltrane, Don Cherry, and Ornette Coleman. The 28-minute &quot;8 Spring Street&quot; is named for the former address of Glenn Branca. The 55-minute final track, &quot;Galaxies (Sky)&quot;, was inspired by a poem by Sun Ra.

In 2020, Moore released a solo album entitled &quot;By the Fire&quot; which featured guitarist James Sedwards and bassist Debbie Googe as on the earlier &quot;The Best Days&quot; album. In 2021, Moore surprise-released an instrumental album entitled &quot;Screen Time&quot;.

Moore is an executive producer of the industrial metal opera &quot;Black Lodge&quot; by David T. Little and Anne Waldman featuring Timur and the Dime Museum, in 2023 on Cantaloupe Music.

===Work on soundtracks===
In 1994, Moore teamed up with Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Don Fleming of Gumball, Mike Mills of R.E.M., and Dave Grohl of Nirvana/Foo Fighters, to form the Backbeat Band, which recorded the soundtrack album to the movie &quot;Backbeat&quot;. In 1998, Moore played on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; as a member of Wylde Ratttz. Moore composed original music for such films as &quot;Heavy&quot; (1995), &quot;Bully&quot; (2001), and &quot;Manic&quot; (2001). In 2007, Moore also appeared with noise/improv group Original Silence, featuring Norwegian drummer Paal Nilssen-Love, guitarist Terrie Ex, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, saxophonist Mats Gustafsson and bassist Massimo Pupillo. The group released the live album &quot;The First Original Silence&quot; in 2007, on Oslo (Norway) label SmallTown Superjazz, and a second album &quot;The Second Original Silence&quot; in 2008.

Moore scored the 2022 HBO miniseries &quot;Irma Vep&quot;.

==Record label==
Moore runs the record label Ecstatic Peace! Beginning in 1993, this label jointly released records with rock critic Byron Coley&#x27;s label, Father Yod, as Ecstatic Yod Records.

==Writings==
Moore and other Sonic Youth members published the irreverent music zine called &quot;Sonic Death&quot;. Moore reviewed new music in &quot;Arthur&quot; in a column entitled &quot;Bull Tongue&quot; written jointly with Byron Coley. Since the demise of &quot;Arthur&quot;, &quot;Bull Tongue&quot; exists as a fanzine edited by Coley and features underground music writing. Moore created, with Chris Habib, the website Protest Records, named for its protest against United States&#x27; invasions in the Middle East. 

Moore was the editor/overseer of the 2005 book &quot;Mix Tape: The Art of Cassette Culture&quot;. He published a highly influential list of collectible free jazz records in Grand Royal magazine.

Ecstatic Peace Library is the book publishing company founded by Thurston Moore and visual book editor Eva Prinz in 2010. The company publishes mainly poetry, but also a collection of books about the early Norwegian black metal scene, experimental jazz from the 70s and other niche subjects.

In the fall of 2023, a hardcover memoir written by Moore called &quot;Sonic Life: A Memoir&quot; was published by Doubleday.

==Teaching==
In 2015 Moore was appointed honorary professor at the Rhythmic Music Conservatory (RMC) in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he periodically conducts workshops and master classes.

==Politics and activism==

Moore is anti-capitalist, and since the 1980s, Moore and his bandmates have been described as anarchists, a label Moore has denied. However, in 2013, he would commend the Occupy Wall Street protests by announcing his support for its anarcho-communist elements.

Since the founding of Sonic Youth, Moore and members of the band have been famously critical of the music industry and what he calls the monopolization of youth culture, with Moore stating in 1991 during filming of &quot;The Year Punk Broke&quot;, 
&quot;People see rock and roll as youth culture, and when youth culture becomes monopolized by big business, what are the youth to do? I think we should destroy the bogus capitalist process that is destroying youth culture&quot;.

Since 2004, Moore has participated in a cultural boycott of Israel, likening the country to an apartheid state and criticizing bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Radiohead for performing in the country.

In June 2016, Moore endorsed the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, releasing a track featuring excerpts from Sanders&#x27; speeches to coincide along his endorsement.

In November 2019, along with other public figures, Moore signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as &quot;a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world&quot; and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election.

In October 2022, Moore expressed support for former president Lula in the 2022 Brazilian general election.

==Personal life==

On June 9, 1984, Moore married Sonic Youth bassist/vocalist Kim Gordon. They have a daughter: Coco Hayley Moore (b. July 1, 1994), a fashion model. On October 14, 2011, the couple announced that they were separating due to an extramarital affair Moore engaged in with art book editor Eva Prinz, who was also married at the time. Moore and Gordon divorced in 2013. Moore was residing in Stoke Newington, London, with Prinz. Moore and Prinz were married in late 2020.

Moore released his memoirs, &quot;Sonic Life: A Memoir&quot;, in October 2023.

==Equipment==
Moore uses a large selection of Fender guitars during Sonic Youth gigs, most frequently a Jazzmaster. His primary stage amp has been the Peavey Roadmaster paired with a Marshall cabinet. He has used the ProCo Rat, Big Muff, and MXR Blue Box pedals in various combinations to achieve his unique distorted and feedback-laden guitar sound.

Moore is a key figure in the popularization and resurrection of the Fender Jazzmaster. In 2009, Fender introduced a Lee Ranaldo signature edition of a Sapphire Blue Transparent version featuring two Fender Wide Range humbucking pickups and a Forest Green transparent finish for Moore, equipped with a pair of Seymour Duncan Antiquity II Jazzmaster single-coil pickups.

In 2016, Yuri Landman made a special 10-string drone guitar for Moore at the request of Premier Guitar.

After graduating from Los Angeles&#x27;s Otis College of Art and Design, she moved to New York City to begin an art career. There, she formed Sonic Youth with Thurston Moore in 1981. She and Moore married in 1984, and the band released a total of six albums on independent labels before the end of the 1980s. It then released nine studio albums on the label DGC Records, beginning with &quot;Goo&quot; in 1990. Gordon was also a founding member of the musical project Free Kitten, which she formed with Julia Cafritz in 1993.

Sonic Youth released its 15th and final studio album, &quot;The Eternal&quot; (2009), on Matador Records before disbanding in 2011 after Gordon and Moore separated. After the dissolution of Sonic Youth and her divorce from Moore, Gordon formed the experimental duo Body/Head with Bill Nace, which releasing its debut album, &quot;Coming Apart&quot;, in 2013. She subsequently formed Glitterbust with Alex Knost, releasing a self-titled debut album in 2016. Body/Head released its second studio album, &quot;The Switch&quot;, in 2018. Gordon released her first solo album, &quot;No Home Record&quot;, in 2019. Her sophomore solo effort, The Collective, followed in 2024. Released to widespread critical acclaim, it has earned Gordon her first two Grammy nominations.

In addition to her work as a musician, Gordon has had ventures in record producing, fashion, and acting, and has worked consistently as a visual artist throughout her musical career. She debuted as a producer on Hole&#x27;s debut album &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; (1991), and founded the Los Angeles–based clothing line X-Girl in 1993. Beginning in the mid-2000s, Gordon began acting, making minor appearances in such films as &quot;Last Days&quot; (2005) and &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; (2007) and guest-starring on several television series. In 2015, she published a memoir, &quot;Girl in a Band&quot;, by HarperCollins imprint Dey Street Books.

==Life and career==
===1953–1978: Early life===
Kim Althea Gordon was born April 28, 1953, in Rochester, New York, the second child of Althea ( 2002) and Calvin Wayne Gordon (19151998). At the time of her birth, Gordon&#x27;s father, a native of Kansas, was a professor in the sociology department at the University of Rochester. Her mother, a descendant of American pioneers of the West Coast, learned to sew during her upbringing in the Great Depression, and worked as a seamstress throughout Gordon&#x27;s childhood. She was described by Gordon as &quot;reserved and usually anxious&quot; and &quot;an unfulfilled artist.&quot; Gordon has one older brother, Keller (1949–2023), whom she described as &quot;brilliant, manipulative, sadistic, arrogant, almost unbearably articulate,&quot; and &quot;the person who more than anyone else in the world shaped who I was, and who I turned out to be.&quot;

At the age of five, Gordon and her family relocated to Los Angeles, California when her father was offered a professorship in the sociology department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he later became the Dean of Faculty. As a child, Gordon attended University Elementary School, a progressive elementary school affiliated with UCLA, which she described as &quot;learn[ing] by doing. So we were always making African spears and going down to the river and making mud huts, or skinning a cowhide and drying it and throwing it off the cliff at Dana Point.&quot; In her memoir, Gordon recounts spending summers with her family in Klamath, California, near the Oregon border. The family also lived in British Hong Kong for one year during her childhood.

Gordon attended University High School in Los Angeles, and dated classmate Danny Elfman while a student there. After graduating high school, she attended Santa Monica College for two years before transferring to York University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Gordon soon grew homesick and chose to drop out of York at the end of the school year and return to Los Angeles. &quot;I was less and less happy as the bleak Toronto winter moved in,&quot; she recalled. &quot;Without the benefit of California sunshine, my hair grew darker and darker, and I had no idea how to dress for the cold.&quot; She decided to enroll at the Otis College of Art and Design, which she said &quot;changed my life.&quot; Gordon lived in Culver City and Venice, Los Angeles, and worked at an Indian restaurant to pay her tuition. She also briefly worked for art dealer Larry Gagosian as a side-job. She graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1977.

While she was a student at Otis, Gordon&#x27;s older brother Keller suffered a psychotic episode on the day of his graduation from the University of California, Berkeley, where he had earned a Master&#x27;s degree in classics. He was subsequently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and for a time lived in halfway houses before becoming a ward of the state of California. The song &quot;Schizophrenia,&quot; which appeared on Sonic Youth&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Sister&quot; (1987), was partly inspired by her brother.

===1979–1994: Sonic Youth and X-Girl===

After graduating from the Otis Art Institute, Gordon moved to New York City in 1980, hoping to pursue a career in art. There, she took art-related jobs to earn an income, such as working as a writer for &quot;Artforum&quot;, and launched a &quot;D.I.Y. project called Design Office, doing low-fi artistic interventions&quot; in friends&#x27; apartments. In 1981, she curated an exhibition at White Columns Gallery that involved contributions from Mike Kelley and Tony Oursler, among others. Around 1981, Gordon became interested in &quot;no-wave&quot; bands, recalling: &quot;When I came to New York, I&#x27;d go and see bands downtown playing no-wave music. It was expressionistic and it was also nihilistic. Punk rock was tongue-in-cheek, saying, &#x27;Yeah, we&#x27;re destroying rock.&#x27; No-wave music is more like, &#x27;NO, we&#x27;re really destroying rock.&#x27; It was very dissonant. I just felt like, Wow, this is really free. I could do that.&quot;
In 1981, Gordon joined the short-lived band CKM, with Christine Hahn and Stanton Miranda, and met her future Sonic Youth bandmates Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore through Miranda. At the time, Gordon, then 27 years old, had never played an instrument. Gordon began dating Moore and, together with Ranaldo, the couple then formed Sonic Youth in 1981. Originally the band released their first unnamed EP (considered by the band to be their first album) in 1982 and their first two albums, &quot;Confusion is Sex&quot; (1983) and &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; (1985) on Neutral and Homestead Records, respectively, before signing with SST to release &quot;EVOL&quot; (1986) and &quot;Sister&quot; (1987). Gordon and Moore married in 1984, three years after beginning Sonic Youth. In October 1988, the band released &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; through Enigma Records.

In 1989, Sonic Youth signed onto DGC Records, a subsidiary of Geffen, and released &quot;Goo&quot; (1990), which became the group&#x27;s first commercial hit. Also in 1989, Gordon, Sadie May, and Lydia Lunch formed Harry Crews, and released the album &quot;Naked in Garden Hills&quot;. To promote &quot;Goo&quot;, Gordon toured with Sonic Youth extensively between 1990 and 1991, and a documentary titled &quot;1991: The Year Punk Broke&quot; documented the band&#x27;s tour with Nirvana, Babes in Toyland, Dinosaur Jr., Gumball and Mudhoney. In early 1991, Courtney Love, who had been influenced by Sonic Youth and the no-wave scene, sent Gordon a letter asking her to produce her band Hole&#x27;s debut record, &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot;. Gordon, along with assistance from Don Fleming, produced the album in March 1991, which received critical acclaim and later achieved cult status. Gordon commented on the recording sessions that Love &quot;was either charming and nice or screaming at her band&quot; but that she was &quot;a really good singer and entertainer and front person.&quot; In 1992, Gordon released a single, &quot;Electric Pen,&quot; with Mirror/Dash, a short-lived project she formed with Moore.

Beginning in 1993, Gordon co-owned, with Daisy von Furth, a women&#x27;s streetwear clothing company in Los Angeles, called X-Girl. The company was a spin-off of X-Large, a men&#x27;s streetwear company co-founded by Michael Diamond of the Beastie Boys. The first X-Girl store was opened in Los Angeles in 1994. Actress Chloë Sevigny served as a model for several pieces in the clothing line. Also in 1993, Gordon formed the musical project Free Kitten with Julia Cafritz. On July 1, 1994, Gordon gave birth to her only child, daughter Coco Hayley Moore, with Thurston Moore.

===1995–2008: Music, art, and acting===
Free Kitten released their debut studio album, &quot;Nice Ass&quot;, in 1995, followed by &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; (1997), both on the independent label Kill Rock Stars. In 1993, Gordon co-directed The Breeders&#x27; &quot;Cannonball&quot; music video with Spike Jonze, and was also involved in an exhibition entitled &quot;Baby Generation&quot; at Parco gallery in Tokyo. Gordon&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Kim&#x27;s Bedroom&quot; was shown at MU in the Netherlands, and included drawing and paintings alongside live music and special guests.
As a part of Sonic Youth, Gordon released several albums in the mid–late 1990s, including &quot;Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star&quot; (1994), &quot;Washing Machine&quot; (1995), and &quot;A Thousand Leaves&quot; (1998), all on DGC Records. They subsequently released &quot;NYC Ghosts &amp; Flowers&quot; in 2000, and &quot;Murray Street&quot; in 2002. In 1999, after selling her share of X-Girl, Gordon relocated with Moore from New York City to Northampton, Massachusetts, to raise their daughter. Around 2002, Gordon became involved with The Supreme Indifference, a musical collaboration that involved Gordon, Jim O&#x27;Rourke and Alan Licht. The band appeared on the 2002 compilation &quot;Fields and Streams&quot;, though their contribution was deemed &quot;annoying&quot; and the project &quot;self-indulgent&quot; by critic Adrian Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot;.

In 2003, Gordon was featured in the Gothenburg Biennale and exhibited &quot;Club In The Shadow&quot;, an installation art collaboration with artist Jutta Koether, at Kenny Schachter&#x27;s Contemporary Gallery in New York City. In 2005, she submitted another collaboration with Koether for the &quot;Her Noise&quot; exhibition in London, United Kingdom, entitled &quot;Reverse Karaoke.&quot; In the same year, an artist&#x27;s book &quot;Kim Gordon Chronicles Vol. 1&quot; was published and featured photos of Gordon throughout her life. The following year, &quot;Kim Gordon Chronicles Vol. 2&quot; was released and featured her drawings, collages, and paintings.

Beginning in 2005, Gordon began appearing in minor or supporting parts in films, first as a record executive in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Last Days&quot;. She then had a small role portraying a textile exporter in the 2007 French thriller film &quot;Boarding Gate&quot;, and in Todd Haynes&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; (2007), inspired by the life of Bob Dylan. The same year, she played a street troubadour in the season six finale of the television series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, along with husband Moore and their daughter Coco, performing the song &quot;What a Waste&quot; from the album &quot;Rather Ripped&quot;.

In September 2008, Gordon launched a limited-edition fashion line called Mirror/Dash (also the name of a musical side project that was created with Moore), inspired by Françoise Hardy and based on the idea that &quot;there&#x27;s a need for clothes for cool moms.&quot;

===2009–2011: Dissolution of Sonic Youth; personal struggles===
Sonic Youth released their final studio album, &quot;The Eternal&quot;, in 2009. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Will Hermes wrote of the album: &quot;It&#x27;s amusing to think that the fiercely freaky Sonic Youth were a major-label act for nearly 20 years. &quot;The Eternal&quot; marks their literal return to indie rock – and that&#x27;s no big whoop, since they&#x27;ve always done pretty much what they want anyway. The irony is that &quot;The Eternal&quot; might be their most concise record ever. It&#x27;s also a rock &amp; roll ass-kicker.&quot; The same year, Gordon, along with the rest of Sonic Youth, made an appearance in the television series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; and performed an acoustic version of the song &quot;Starpower&quot;.

In 2011, Gordon and Moore separated after 27 years of marriage. The next month, bandmate Ranaldo said Sonic Youth had disbanded, after having been together 30 years. After their divorce was finalized in April 2013, Gordon revealed that she had confronted Moore about a text message from another woman which was then followed by counseling sessions, and the separation occurred because Moore continued his extra-marital relationship. Gordon said her ex-husband was &quot;like a lost soul.&quot;

She also said she had been diagnosed with DCIS breast cancer during her divorce, which was successfully treated with surgery.

===Since 2012: Body/Head and other projects===

Following the announcement of Sonic Youth&#x27;s hiatus, Gordon commenced touring with Ikue Mori, Tokyo-born drummer of late-1970s band DNA—Gordon had performed with Mori previously at events such as the NoFunFest in 2004. The duo completed a European tour in mid-2012 and Gordon explained during a corresponding interview: &quot;You sorta want to get lost and you hope that the audience gets lost with you ... You can feel if they&#x27;re listening, you can feel if there&#x27;s some connection.&quot; Together with Bill Nace, Gordon and Mori were selected for the June 2013 All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties event that was curated by the band Deerhunter. Around 2012, Gordon formed a noise guitar project with Nace, entitled Body/Head, and a single called &quot;The Eyes, The Mouth&quot; was released in 2012 on Belgian label Ultra Eczema. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Coming Apart&quot; was released on September 10, 2013, on the Matador Records label and the band completed a U.S. tour during the fall of 2013.

Gordon also immersed herself in producing art, having felt that music had &quot;sidetracked&quot; her career as a visual artist. She held several art exhibitions in 2013, including &quot;The Show Is Over,&quot; at Gagosian Gallery in London, and the survey &quot;Design Office with Kim Gordon–Since 1980,&quot; at White Columns, New York, the latter a revival of a project she had begun in 1980. In 2014, she presented newly created &quot;Wreath Paintings&quot; throughout Rudolf Schindler&#x27;s iconic Fitzpatrick-Leland House under the byname of Design Office. In January 2014, she appeared in the season three premiere of the series &quot;Girls&quot; as Mindy, a recovering drug addict in a rehab support group. She then appeared as herself in a March 2014 episode of &quot;Portlandia&quot;.

Gordon published a memoir, &quot;Girl in a Band&quot;, on February 24, 2015, by HarperCollins imprint Dey Street Books. The memoir explores her childhood, life in art and Sonic Youth, and marriage to and divorce from Thurston Moore. Its title, &quot;Girl in a Band&quot;, stems from a lyric in &quot;Sacred Trickster&quot; from Sonic Youth&#x27;s final album, &quot;The Eternal&quot; (2009). The lyric goes, &quot;What&#x27;s it like to be a girl in a band?/ I don&#x27;t quite understand.&quot; The same year, Gordon appeared in &quot;The Nightmare&quot; (2015), a German horror film in which she portrayed a schoolteacher, which was released at the Locarno International Film Festival. She also contributed to its soundtrack. In November that year, Gordon relocated from the Massachusetts home she had shared with Moore and their daughter to her hometown of Los Angeles, purchasing a home in the Franklin Hills neighborhood.

Also in 2015, Gordon formed the experimental musical group Glitterbust with guitarist Alex Knost, releasing a self-titled debut album in March 2016. Gordon then appeared in Tony Oursler&#x27;s film &quot;Imponderable&quot;, which screened at the Museum of Modern Art in June 2016. On September 12, 2016, Gordon released her first solo single, &quot;Murdered Out&quot;, followed on August 20, 2019, by a second solo single, &quot;Sketch Artist&quot;. A third track, &quot;Air BnB&quot;, was released on September 11. All tracks appear on her first solo record on Matador Records, &quot;No Home Record&quot;, which was released on October 13, 2019.

In 2017, Gordon had a small role on the HBO series &quot;Animals&quot;, followed by a supporting role in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s comedy-drama film &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, He Won&#x27;t Get Far on Foot&quot;. Her album &quot;No Home Record&quot; was rated number 8 of Paste Magazine&#x27;s &quot;20 Best Punk Albums of 2019&quot;.

&quot;Kim Gordon: Lo-Fi Glamour&quot;, Gordon&#x27;s first North American museum solo-exhibition, opened at The Andy Warhol Museum in 2019. The exhibition features a commissioned score for Andy Warhol’s 1963–64 silent film &quot;Kiss&quot; in conversation with text paintings, figure drawings and erotic sculpture.

In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked Gordon the 39th greatest bassist of all time.

In December 2021, Gordon recorded a 7&quot; single on Sub Pop Records with J Mascis titled &quot;Abstract Blues&quot; backed with &quot;Slow Boy&quot;.

&quot;Bye Bye&quot; was released as a single in January 2024. The track is from Gordon&#x27;s album &quot;The Collective&quot;, which was released in March 2024. The song is accompanied by an official video starring her daughter Coco Gordon Moore.

==Artistry==
Gordon possesses a contralto vocal range. A 2016 review from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted her voice as &quot;one of the great instruments in post-punk history, though she doesn&#x27;t always get credit for the variety of her technique.&quot; Despite her prolific career in music, Gordon told journalist Evan Smith in a 2015 interview that she never considered herself a musician, explaining that she had been &quot;drawn into the world&quot; of the music scenes happening in the 1980s, and that she &quot;felt like an outsider&quot; once part of it. Gordon&#x27;s instrumental work as a guitarist has been described as &quot;free-form&quot; and experimental.

==Influences==
Several female musicians influenced Gordon. She stated in 2015: 

==Public image==

Gordon is a popular culture icon, epitomizing an &quot;ineffable, magnetic coolness&quot; and &quot;a certain brand of aloof, downtown cool.&quot; Some journalists have noted her as a public figure who has &quot;never given much away&quot; about herself. Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys commented on Gordon&#x27;s persona, stating: &quot;Wherever Kim ends up, she is the coolest person in the room. But I know her, and I know she&#x27;d rather be at home grilling hot dogs.&quot;

Gordon has also been cited as &quot;a modest polymath&quot; given her varied career pursuits in art, music, fashion, and acting. While observations were made by the media of Gordon being &quot;dauntingly impressive and self-assured&quot; during her tenure with Sonic Youth, she commented in a retrospective interview that she was &quot;pretty insecure about my image and where I fitted in.&quot; Describing her image, she said: &quot;I knew I couldn&#x27;t achieve some kind of cool, stylised image, that just wasn&#x27;t me...  It was a reaction to corporate style. So it was kind of just being yourself, you know walking on stage wearing a t-shirt.&quot;

Upon the release of her 2015 memoir, Gordon received some criticism for comments made about other musicians, among them Lana Del Rey: &quot;Naturally, [she]&#x27;s just a persona. If she really truly believes it&#x27;s beautiful when young musicians go out on a hot flame of drugs and depression, why doesn&#x27;t she just off herself?&quot; Gordon also reflected on working with Courtney Love in 1991, writing: &quot;No one ever questions the disorder behind her tarantula LA glamour – sociopathy, narcissism – because it&#x27;s good rock and roll, good entertainment! I have a low tolerance for manipulative, egomaniacal behavior, and usually have to remind myself that the person might be mentally ill.&quot; Gordon clarified her comments on Del Rey in a subsequent interview, stating: &quot;Initially it was about just seeing something in the paper... something about how rock stars should just like kill themselves with drugs, and Frances Bean [Cobain] had really reacted to that and I felt really actually weirdly protective of Frances. So I was basically just trying to point out that it was a persona and I just offhandedly said what I said...  I guess I could have articulated the whole thing a lot better.&quot;

==Honors==
On May 21, 2015, Gordon was honored at The Kitchen&#x27;s Spring Gala.

On May 5, 2018, she received an Honorary Doctorate from the Emily Carr University of Art and Design.

==Legacy==
Gordon and her contributions in Sonic Youth are considered by critics and music scholars to have been key influences in the development of grunge music and riot grrrl, both musical movements which began in the early 1990s. Among those who have cited her as an influence are filmmaker Sofia Coppola, musician Kathleen Hanna, and Irish singer Róisín Murphy. Hanna explained in 2013:

She was a forerunner, musically. Just knowing a woman was in a band trading lead vocals, playing bass, and being a visual artist at the same time made me feel less alone. As a radical feminist singer, I wasn&#x27;t particularly well liked. I was in a punk underground scene dominated by hardcore dudes who yelled mean shit at me every night, and journalists routinely called my voice shrill, unlistenable. Kim made me feel accepted in a way I hadn&#x27;t before. Fucking Kim Gordon thought I was on the right track, haters be damned. It made the bullshit easier to take, knowing she was in my corner.

<text>Lee Mark Ranaldo (born February 3, 1956) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter, best known as a co-founder of the rock band Sonic Youth. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Ranaldo at number 33 on its &quot;Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; list. In May 2012, &quot;Spin&quot; published a staff-selected top 100 guitarist list, ranking Ranaldo and his Sonic Youth bandmate Thurston Moore together at number 1.

==Biography==

Ranaldo was born in Glen Cove, Long Island, studied art and graduated from Binghamton University. He has three sons, Cody, Sage and Frey, and has been married twice, first with Amanda Linn in 1981 but later divorced, and now with experimental artist Leah Singer.

Ranaldo started his career in New York in several bands, including The Flucts, and by playing guitar in &quot;Guitar Trio&quot; with Rhys Chatham before joining the electric guitar orchestra of Glenn Branca. In Branca&#x27;s orchestra he played mainly electric guitar, but he also played some of the harmonic guitars Branca designed and built. In 1981, Ranaldo and David Linton briefly joined the band Plus Instruments that had been formed by Truus de Groot. With this line-up they recorded the album &quot;February - April 1981&quot;, released on the Dutch Kremlin label. After the release of the album, Ranaldo left the band and started Sonic Youth with Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon.

==Solo records during Sonic Youth==

In 1987, Ranaldo released his first solo album, &quot;From Here to Infinity&quot;, compositions which ended in locked grooves. The second side of the album also featured an unplayable engraving by Savage Pencil.

Among Ranaldo&#x27;s solo records are &quot;Dirty Windows&quot;, a collection of spoken texts with music, &quot;Amarillo Ramp (For Robert Smithson)&quot;, pieces for the guitar, and &quot;Scriptures of the Golden Eternity&quot;. His books include several with art or photography by Leah Singer, including &quot;Drift&quot;, &quot;Bookstore&quot;, &quot;Road Movies&quot;, and &quot;Moroccan Journal: Jajouka excerpt&quot; (from a full-length book of writings on Moroccan travels and music). Ranaldo has also published &quot;Jrnls80s&quot; (published by Soft Skull Press), as well as a book of poems, &quot;Lengths &amp; Breaths&quot;, with photography by Cynthia Connolly. His most recent book of poetry, &quot;Against Refusing&quot;, was published by Water Row Press in April 2010 with cover artwork by Leah Singer. His visual and sound works have been shown at galleries and museums in Paris, Toronto, New York, London, Sydney, Los Angeles, Vienna, and elsewhere.

==After Sonic Youth==
After Sonic Youth went on hiatus in 2011, Ranaldo released &quot;Between the Times and the Tides&quot; in early 2012 on Matador Records. The record was the first under his own name to feature comparatively straightforward, vocal pop rock songs. Contributors to the record include Jim O&#x27;Rourke, Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley, former Sonic Youth drummer Bob Bert, Wilco&#x27;s Nels Cline, Alan Licht, John Medeski, and bassist Irwin Menken.

Preceded by a 2012 event at Nuit Blanche, on October 21, 2011, The Music Gallery, InterAccess and the Images Festival presented the North American premiere of Ranaldo&#x27;s &quot;Contre Jour&quot;, a performance piece for swinging guitar, with visuals by longtime partner and collaborator Leah Singer. This performance was also done in Paris, Rotterdam, during IFFR, and Madrid. In 2012, he performed a solo concert at Parisian music club La Maroquinerie where he was photographed by Jean-Pierre Domingue.

To tour for the album, Ranaldo organized The Dust as his formal group, featuring Licht, Shelley, and bassist Tim Lüntzel. In 2013, his follow-up album &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot; was released, credited to Lee Ranaldo and the Dust.

In 2014 Ranaldo and the Dust spent one week in Barcelona with producer Raül Refree and cut a full-band, all-acoustic album, Acoustic Dust, consisting of songs from &quot;Between The Times and the Tides&quot; and &quot;Last Night On Earth&quot;, plus cover songs including Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Revolution Blues&quot;, Sandy Denny&#x27;s &quot;Bushes and Briars&quot;, and Mike Nesmith (The Monkee)&#x27;s &quot;You Just May Be The One&quot;.

In September 2017, Ranaldo released &quot;Electric Trim&quot;, his third proper solo album, made in collaboration with Barcelona Musician/Producer Raül Refree, on Mute records. The album featured 9 songs, many of the lyrics co-written with American author Jonathan Lethem. Musical contributors included Nels Cline, Sharon Van Etten, Alan Licht, Tim Luntzel, Kid Millions and Steve Shelley. A film about the making of the album &quot;HELLO HELLO HELLO : LEE RANALDO : ELECTRIC TRIM&quot; was directed by Fred Riedel.

Besides working as a guitarist, Ranaldo has frequently produced sound, performance and visual art independently of Sonic Youth. He has released over fifty solo, band and collaborative recordings, and a dozen books; including travel journals, poetry and artists&#x27; books. His work has been exhibited at numerous galleries and museums, including the Hayward Gallery in London, the Sydney Museum of Contemporary Art, NSCAD in Halifax, the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, Mercer Union in Toronto, and Printed Matter, Inc., Artspace and White Columns in New York. In 2017 there was a large overview exhibition in Menen, Belgium about his visual art.

In 2019 he was the curator for a concert series in Fondation Feltrinelli in Milan, Italy, under the umbrella name of &quot;Natural Disruptors&quot;.

In 2021, Ranaldo released &quot;In Virus Times&quot;, an EP of solo acoustic guitar pieces recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2024, Ranaldo received the honorary Doctor of Music degree from his alma mater, Binghamton University.

==Collaborations and side projects==
Ranaldo has produced albums for artists including Babes in Toyland, You Am I, Magik Markers, Deity Guns, and Dutch art rock-ensemble Kleg. He has edited a volume of tour journals from the 1995 Lollapalooza tour written by himself, Thurston Moore, Beck, Stephen Malkmus, Courtney Love, and others.

Ranaldo has worked with jazz drummer William Hooker on improvised music, and reading and improvising poetry and released several records together.

His main side projects are Drift and Text of Light.

Drift is a duo with his wife Leah Singer, with whom he has performed many live installation pieces with improvised music. The collaboration, utilizing live manipulated 16mm film projections, electric guitar and recited texts, occupied the duo from the early 1990s until late 2005, when they re-created the performance as an art installation at Gigantic Art Space, a gallery in New York City. Since then the pair have been performing a new piece entitled &quot;iloveyouihateyou&quot;, a combination installation and performance work that has been presented in the US and Europe. In 2005 Drift released a box set with a DVD and a book.

Text of Light was founded in 2001 by Ranaldo, Alan Licht, Ulrich Krieger, Christian Marclay and William Hooker. The core group is Ranaldo, Licht and Krieger with changing DJs (Marclay, DJ Olive, Marina Rosenfeld) and drummers (Hooker, Tim Barnes, Steve Shelley). The music is free improvised and mostly played along with, but not really referencing, films by Stan Brakhage. The name for the band comes from Brakhage&#x27;s film &quot;The Text of Light&quot;.

In 2007 Ranaldo collaborated with British rock band The Cribs on their third album &quot;Men&#x27;s Needs, Women&#x27;s Needs, Whatever&quot;. Ranaldo performs a spoken word piece against the track &quot;Be Safe&quot;. Ranaldo made an appearance in the 2008 feature documentary by Nik Sheehan about Brion Gysin and the Dreamachine entitled &quot;FLicKer&quot;.

Glacial Trio is a band consisting of Ranaldo, Bagpiper David Watson and drummer Tony Buck. In 2010 Ranaldo released the solo album &quot;Maelstrom From Drift&quot; on Three Lobed Recordings with guest appearances of Buck and Watson. The band released &quot;On Jones Beach&quot; in 2012.

In 2022 Ranaldo collaborated with Catalan French musician Pascal Comelade and drummer Ramon Prats in a concert inspired by Velvet Underground music for the premiere of &quot;Linger On: The Velvet Underground&quot; a book published by Eva and Thurston Moore’s Ecstatic Peace Library by Catalan music journalist Ignasi Julià. The concert was recorded and released as Velvet Serenade.

==Art projects==

===Visual works===
Ranaldo also has had some exhibitions with his visual arts and video works in combination with Sonic Youth-related art (posters, flyers, album covers, etc.). 
This took place as gallery and museum shows in Porto, Halifax, Miami, Tampa, Vienna, Prague, Gent, Bratislava, Auckland, Salt Lake City and in Brooklyn and at the VOLTA fair in Manhattan in 2015.
Artist-in-Residence: CNEAI, Paris (2007, 2008); NSCAD, Halifax, Nova Scotia (2013); Villa Arson, Nice, France (2014). In October 2017 his first European solo exhibition &#x27;Lost Ideas&#x27; by Curator Jan Van Woensel takes place in Cultuurcentrum De Steiger in Menen, Belgium together with a music festival curated by Ranaldo. The festival also features his field recording sound art piece &#x27;Shibuya Displacement&#x27;.

===Sound art===
In the late 2000s Ranaldo started giving many sound art performances in the US and Europe with his installation &#x27;Suspended Guitar&#x27;, which involved a guitar hanging on a rope from the ceiling feedbacking and being played with a bow, or hitting against the body or the strings. In 2006 he made the sound art piece &#x27;Shibuya Displacement (a Soundwalk)&#x27; for the Hudson Valley Center For Contemporary Art.

==Equipment==
Ranaldo has used many guitars but is associated with the Fender Jazzmaster, Telecaster Deluxe electric guitars and sometimes Gibson Les Pauls, usually with radically alternative tunings, and modifications. One of his Jazzmasters has a single coil pickup installed between the bridge and the tailpiece to exploit the resonating chiming sounds on that area of string at these so-called tailed bridge guitars. Ranaldo is one of the few popular artists to use the Ovation Viper solid body electric.

In 2007 Yuri Landman built for Ranaldo the Moonlander, a biheaded electric guitar with 18 strings: 6 normal strings and 12 sympathetic strings.

Since Ranaldo and Moore are popularizers of the Fender Jazzmaster, Fender introduced in 2009 a special Lee Ranaldo signature edition of a transparent blue version, together with a transparent green one for Moore.

In 2013, Ranaldo played a Watcher guitar from the French company Custom77 during his last Lee Ranaldo &amp; The Dust tour throughout Europe.
